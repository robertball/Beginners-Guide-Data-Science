I do it twice in one week.  that gives me liberty to rate it twice, you think?  Even more so, because my two-year old and I ate the rest of the leftovers and my husband pouted!!  So, I had to make another batch of this yummy dish.

I measured my spices this go-round. and used between 1/2 and 3/4 of a teaspoon of the basil and oregano, the full teaspoon of the Italian seasoning and it couldn't have been better.  More fetta, less parm.  And used two small fresh tomatoes again and layered them in between the macaroni and the layer of cheese on top.  I found the first go round that if I mixed the tomatoes in, the macaroni wasn't as gooey/cheesy; it tended to seperate.   so, the layering worked PERFECT.  Try it!  You Won't Be Disappointed.

I made this and with a few changes it was awesome. I omitted tomatoes and added 1 tin of tomato paste.  I just used basil, salt, pepper and nutmeg for seasonings. I added 1.5 cups mozerella 1.5 of cheddar and 1/2 of parmesian. Kids gobbled it up.  Thanks

I know this may sound weird, but I've never been a fan of rich/super creamy macaroni and cheese. This recipe is exactly what I had been looking for! I made it for my boyfriend and we both thought it was great. I can understand how some people may find it a bit dry, but that's a big part of why I enjoyed it so much. I'll definitely be making this on a regular basis.

Excellent dish!  I made the following changes:  used only one 14.5 oz can of tomatoes, and didn't use italian seasoning (just oregano and basil).  I also didn't put the tomatoes in a separate bowl first as the recipe called for...I just added them into the casserole dish and mixed in after the first batch of cheeses.  A great twist on regular mac-n-cheese!

this recipe turned out pretty well, some reviews said it turned out dry so i mixed several ounces of sour cream in with the pasta and it was perfect.

This was great except it DEFINITELY needs some cream added to make it creamier, it was a bit dry.  Makes awesome left overs.

Absolutely amazing, a true keeper! THe first time I made this my husband had 4 servings, no kidding! I do add more cheese & seasonings based on our personal preference & layered the pasta & the tomato mixture as other reviews did. It makes great leftovers too! My husband & I can't get enough of this dish!
Thanks for this one!

Pretty tasty recipe. My pre-teens gobbled this down. A bit reminiscent of Macaroni Grill with the addition of tomatoes and Italian spices. I'll be making this one again.

I thought the recipe was pretty good, although I made a few changes.  I added 1 cup of cream (half and half) into the macaroni and melted cheese (it made it creamier than I believe it would have been otherwise) I also added 1 tbsp of butter in with the pasta.  I took another reviewers advice, and put the tomato mixture as a layer in between 2 layers of the pasta (I only had 1/2 a can of tomatoes on hand, so I cut up 2 fresh tomatoes to compensate and it turned out well).  I used a little less than 1 tsp of each spice, but next time I'll cut out the italian seasoning all together--I didn't like the blend of rosemary and some of the other flavours with the dish.  I added 1/4 cup of feta in with the tomato mixture as well.  On top, I sprinkled a bit more of each cheese, then topped with bread crumbs and baked (uncovered) for 25 minutes.  Aside from the italian seasoning, it came out really well.  I will make it again with my changes.

This recipe was very good! I used Penne because I had no macaroni on hand and subbed shredded Swiss for the Mozzarella which I also didn't have. On the advice of other reviewers, I used two 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes with the juice and also a little butter. It wasn't dry at all. Very cheesy and very delicious.

This was pretty good.  I added cubed chicken and 2 tbsp of butter to make the cheese creamier.  My family ate it with no complaints.

Delicious and easy! I followed the exact recipe, but used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I once even baked it on the (covered) gas grill outside, and it was great. Thanks!

I really did not like this.  It may have been too salty, but I didn't care for this mix of ingredients either.

This was a hit at a Thanksgiving get together! I changed the recipe only a little, I used all the listed cheeses but also a colby jack mixture, and about a cup of half & half in the mixture to make it creamier. I will definitely be making this again! :)

Best mac 'n cheese we've ever made.  I layered the pasta then 1 can diced tomatoes like other reviewers suggested, topped with the rest of the cheese, then sprinkled the top with some crushed cheese-it crackers.  Added a nice texture and taste!

This was tasty. Good comfort food. I added more cheese, as follows - 1 cup cheddar, 1.5 cups mozz, 1/2 cup parm, 1/2 cup feta into the pasta. I also added a splash of cream, which made it a bit creamier. Before baking in the oven, I sprinked 1/2 cup cheddar, 1/2 cup mozz, 1/2 cup parm, and 1/2 cup feta. I did the tomato/herb mixture as directed and thought it was great. I personally believe the feta adds a lot of great, special flavor to this. I will make this again, and will probably experiment with more cheese and/or more cream to see if I can make this a little bit creamier next time around. **Edit** I made this a second time and added a pad of butter and a few TBS of cream to the cheese mixture. Also, I increased the cheese to the follow amounts:  1.5 cup cheddar, 1.5 cup mozzarella, 1/2 cup parm, 3/4 cup feta mixed into the pasta AND 1/2 cup of each type of cheese sprinkled on top. These additions made for an awesomely creamy texture, and we LOVED it this way!

I did change it a little, just because of what I had on hand.  I mixed some Spicy Spaghetti seasoning and a teaspoon of sugar in with a can of diced Italian tomatoes and used shakable parmesan cheese along with colby-jack and it was so delicious and simple.  Our new favorite comfort dinner!  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome dish! Loved it! The only things I changed was that I used diced tomatoes instead of whole and I used a mixed Italian cheese blend with Parmesan, Provolone, and Mozzarella. Turned out moist and delicious even my picky son enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing!

Very good although I didn't use feta because it was too expensive.  I also added steamed broccoli and decreased the spices.  Very cheesy!

This recipe came out really, really greasy.  I'm not sure if it's the cheese I used (I chose to double the cheddar and skip the mozzerella), but the whole thing was just too greasy for my tastes.

I left out the tomatoes, and added some minced onion that I'd sauted with butter and white wine. I also added a couple of heaping Tblsp Dijon Mustard, which added a nice bite. Very tasty :)

VERY tasty variation on what I'm used to.  I didn't think I would like the tomatoes or spices, but they added just enough tang to make it interesting. My husband, who usually refuses anything but Stouffer's mac&cheese, loves it.

I thought this was pretty good and my husband loved it! It was a little different for Mac and Cheese, and I did add a little milk to it so it would not be so dry.

I took this to a potluck, and the dish was clean.  However, I thought it was a little bit dry.  I may try adding just a touch of milk, or perhaps adding some processed cheese to make it a little creamier.  Otherwise, it was wonderful!

Great easy recipe.  I covered it with foil and it wasn't dry as many have stated.  I did leave out the Italian Seasoning and just used the basil and oregano.  They were all the seasoning it needed.

In my opinion it needed more cheese, but I didn't put the feta cheese in, we didn't have any at the time

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  The taste was quite good but I felt it to was too dry.  I am not sure if I did something wrong, I did follow the recipe to the letter.  There was no actual sauce with the noodles.  Again, good taste but it needs some moisture...still trying to figure out what to add to get it without ruining the integrity of the dish.

VERY good.  It was my first baked macaroni!  Used gemelli because I had no mac, and stewed tomatoes.  Had to add some sour cream to make it a bit more creamy, and added bread crumbs on top.  Yummy!

I make this all the time my family loves it and it is so easy on the pocket. only thing different is I double the recpie  add 1 whole chicken remove bones and makes 2 - 9 x 13 pans = 1/2 chicken per pan.  NOTE: I cook the chicken the night before let cool  remove the skin & bones add to casserole  bake and enjoy my family there is never any leftovers. serve with Garlic bread it is wonderful.

It was way too overpowering with all the cheese and it just wasn't creamy.  I did like the addition of the spices and tomatoes.

This is an easy dish to throw together quickly, with ingredients I usually have on hand.  I liked the addition of tomatoes, Italian seasoning and feta to give this a little more grown up tasting mac and cheese.  It is definitely on the dry side, since there is not a roux base in which to melt the cheese in, and I usually prefer a creamier mac and cheese, but this sounded good today.  I will probably make this again.

The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star rating is because I've had better. But this was very good. After I got it assembled I was really concerned about the lack of liquid, so I added about a fourth cup of water (didn't have milk on hand), and it turned out very good. Much better than I expected.

This sounded a little wierd at first but it turned out quite good. I didn't have any feta so I had to do without, but it was still very good and I'll bet with the feta it would be even better. I saw some of the reviews saying it was dry so I didn't drain the tomatoes. Seems to have added enough moisture. Next time I'll top with some bread crumbs. Yummy and quick and easy - can't ask for much more than that!

Delicious! Somehow three of us managed to eat the whole thing in one sitting (awful, but so worth it)! Omitted the tomatoes and feta and added peas due to personal taste. Came out great.

I would have given this just a three stars but then I felt it may not be fair since I did make some changes. I didn't have a can of crushed tomatoes so I just put some fresh ones through the food processor with the spices. I also used more feta cheese and less hard, a good move in my opinion. Since there were a lot of complaints of dryness, I drizzled some milk over the casserole before baking. Not recommended - it made it a tad soggy. All in all, this dish wasn't bad, but it wasn't terribly exciting either.

This Casserole is delicious! I loved it. I couldn't find what to make for Easter Dinner, and found this and it was great! Instead of the tomatoes, I put light cream in, and no feta. I don't like feta. There was a LOT of cheese! There was more cheese for the topping then the actual macaroni! It was soooo good!

i'm mixed on this recipe and how to review/rate it.  to start with, i found it to be very dry.  it absolutely needs milk, cream, or sour cream to be added.  i also was not a fan of the italian seasoning/oregano/basil flavoring.  i liked the addition of tomatoes, although the kids did not.  if i were to make this again, i'd add about a half cup or so of sour cream, 1/4 cup or so of half and half, omit the seasonings, and layer sliced tomatoes over half and leave the other half plain for the kiddos.

A nice twist on traditional macaroni and cheese casserole ... we enjoyed the tomatoes (though it was too spicy for my daughter when using habanero diced tomatoes)!  I did add sour cream, so that the dish wouldn't be too dry ... and sprinkled bread crumbs on top.

I made this tonite for dinner and changed a couple of things. I wanted to make this a complete meal so I browned 2-3 lbs of ground beef and drained, then sauteed some sweet onion and garlic in olive oil and added diced tomatoes along with the seasonings to the garlic onion mixture and heated that thru. I added the cheese to the hot pasta but also added an 8oz brick of soften cream cheese to combat dryness and make it richer. Paired this dish with an arugula salad and dijon vinegarette, crusty bread and this was one awesome meal!!! Thanks so much

I make this all the time; it makes a lot and I just freeze it in individual meals for when I don't have time to cook.  I use fresh herbs when I can and canned diced tomatoes.  If you do use fresh herbs, though, make sure all your ingredients are ready to go by the time the pasta's cooked, for the cheese won't melt properly unless it's mixed in immediately.  It's not a very healthy meal, but probably better than boxed mac 'n cheese, and tastes _much_ better!

Excellent! Even tho i was expecting a creamy Macaroni dish, this was not a disappointment. The spices make the dish delicious- I wanted a little kick so I added some cayenne pepper and cumin.  yummy!

i made this yesterday for thanksgiving with a twist and it came out great. I melted 12oz of Velveeta cheese with some milk and butter in a saucepan with medium heat until smooth. I combined with rotini pasta (curly pasta), steamed broccoli and all other ingredients before placing in pan. 10 min before dinner, i placed in oven at 350 degrees covered so that the cheeses would melt and it was creamy and deliciously excellent!

It was good. But to make it more flavourful I added basil pesto.  The Italian seasoning didn't do enough for flavour.

This is my go-to mac'n'cheese recipe. I always have all the ingredients on hand and even if I'm missing one, it's so easy to find a new variation that's just as delicious! I use a can of Italian diced tomatoes (drained) and I mix everything in a 9"x13" baking dish to make this a one-dish recipe. For a richer flavor, I will use a can of tomato paste with the above seasonings plus fresh basil and thyme. To top it all off, I dust the top with bread crumbs. So tasty and so simple!

I didn't care for this dish at all although my kids surprisingly liked it.  I thought it was dry - didn't enjoy the tomatoes thrown in with the mac-n-cheese.  Definitely will not make again.

This casserole is FABULOUS!  I used diced tomatoes and didn't have feta cheese (added more of the other kinds) but it was really really yummy.  The kids loved it, my husband loved it.  Very easy to make compared to any other kind of macaroni and cheese I have made.

I really did not care for this. It was dry and I didn't like the way the ingredients tasted together. I followed the recipe exactly and I definitely should have used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I will not be making this again.

There were only 2 of us here to eat this but it was gone by the following morning. We're cheese-freaks so this was a big hit. The only thing that takes any time with this recipe is shredding all the cheese, but if you have a food processor you're golden. I'll be making this for potlucks in the future.

I found the ingredients really didn't mesh well in the final product. The macaroni was too slippery to stick to anything and the cheese was really thick. If I make this again I think I will use part tomato paste or part condensed tomato soup instead of all tomatoes, and maybe use something similar to breadcrumbs or crackers in the topping. Edited to note that this dish reheats well.

This was pretty good.  The cheese became a bit unruly when trying to stir it into the pasta. Kind of glooped altogether but I persevered. My hubby, who does not normally like macaroni and cheese, really liked this and said so a couple of times.  So that's a big thumbs up.  Reheats well for lunch...as it should because the recipe makes a ton as written.  Keeper!

I made this.  It has a nice Italian flavor to it.  I liked the blends of the different cheeses.  It doesn't say to cook it uncovered or covered specifically.  I baked it uncovered and it came out dry.  Try baking it covered.

Wonderful surprise. For me, I would add more feta and reduce one of the other three cheeses. I used whole wheat noodles that added a mouth feel and wheatiness that complemented the cheeses and slices.

I also added 1/2 block cream cheese and some garlic powder....very good!

I put about a 1/4 cup of Miracle Whip with the cheese and mixed it in. Not too creamy and adds zip :)  Did use more feta than Parmesan, and I added a little sugar to the tomatoes..yum :)

Loved this casserole.  Only changes I made, 2-1/2 cups mac and because we love feta cheese, I used at least 1/2 cup.  I am now printing this off for friends who tried it last night.  Thanks.

A number of reviewers said this recipe was to dry.  One of the reviewers added more cheese and cream to make this recipe creamy, so I modified it in a similar way.  I mixed 1.5 cups of cheddar cheese, 1.5 cups of mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup of parmasean cheese, and 1/2 cup of feta cheese, and 1/2 cup of milk INTO the macaroni.  I didn't use the italian spice (but did do 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper).  I don't think putting the tomato mix in the middle instead of mixing it in is a good idea.  On the top, I added 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup parmasean cheese and 1/8 feta cheese.  In the end, it was creamy.  There was to much feta, would definitley decrease amount (maybe 1/8-1/4 in the macaroni mix).  I would increase the milk to 3/4 cups.  My kids didn't like tomatoes in their M&C, but husband liked it.

This is a great dish.  As others have stated, my kids went for thirds and fourth servings.  But don't be fooled if you are looking for a home made Macaroni and Cheese.  This is not it.

This was ok.  Nothing spectacular.  I used extra cheese and instead of mixing in the whole peeled tomatoes, I topped  the macaroni and cheese mixture with 28 oz. diced tomatoes with liquid.  It wasn't dry this way but I probably won't make again.

This turned out great! A lot of people commented about it not being creamy, but its not supposed to be- this isn't Kraft.  I thinks its perfect just the way it is, although I might add frozen spinach next time for a little more health value.

This recipe was great! However, I added one change: I mixed 3/4 cup of Italian style bread crumbs and 1 tbsp. of melted margarine with a fork and sprinkled it on top of the casserole.

This recipe is a keeper for sure! It is so easy to customize to your tastes. I added an extra cup each of cheddar and mozarella, put the tomato mix on top like another reviewer suggested and also added half a jar of traditional spaghetti sauce as it looked like it would be too dry. It turned out AWESOME! It did take more like 40 minutes of bake time.

This was delicious!  I didn't have feta, so I used provolone cheese instead.  To give it more color, I diced up green peppers.  It was beautiful and was gone in 10 min. into our party!!!

This recipes halves very well. I, too, added a little more cheese than what it called for. It was very tasty- not exactly what you think of when you think of "mac and cheese" but, very good. I served mine ata pot luck as well, and it was totally gone before I even got there! The kids like it, but it doesn't have that "chef boyardee" taste at all! adults will also enjoy it because it is made with real cheese. 
I was skeptical at first because there really isn't any "sauce" that you mix with the pasta, but rather its just melted cheese, it actually was very good and the addition of the tomatoes and seasoning makes it great! and adds some color as well. I also used the "corkscrew" style pasta noodles instead of elbow macaroni to make it more "Adult" and it was very pretty. I love this and will make again for sure!

I made this for dinner tonight and all of my roommates loved it. I went to go back and get more, but it was all gone! Very quick and easy to make. The different cheeses and spices add flavor to this yummy dish. Awsome!

This was very easy to put together and extremely tasty!  I added some chopped caulifower in the last minute of cooking the pasta, and 1/4 cup chopped onion, 2 cloves of minced garlic to the chopped tomatoes.  This is definitey going on our menu rotation!
