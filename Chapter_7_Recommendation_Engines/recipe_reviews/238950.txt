I made a homemade pie crust and a homemade alfredo sauce as I do not like prepared alfredo sauce. One note. I don't suggest using the garlic unless you saut√© it first,otherwise I would use garlic granules. I think adding a touch of Italian seasoning would benefit this recipe. This was a nice change of pace.

Excellent! I had leftover chicken and half a jar of leftover Alfredo sauce that I wanted to use up, so I added a proportional amount of fresh vegetables (carrots, bell pepper, green onion, celery, and broccoli) to make a small chicken pot pie. It was delicious! 
Thanks for this recipe!
