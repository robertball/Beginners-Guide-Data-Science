More work than usual,  but worth it.  Not too hard too make. Two great flavors together.  I used sorghum instead of molasses at the same amount. I would use less sugar next time, a bit too sweet overall. Rolling in raw sugar works very well.  I tried without,  better with.  The peanut butter batter keeps the center soft.

These cookies were delicious, chewy and subtle peanut butter.

A holiday hit!  Even my curmudgeon Scrooge friend  who growls at desserts loved the ginger molasses/peanut butter combo.  Have also made both recipes as stand-alone cookies.  Yum.

These were definitely tasty, but the flavors are not balanced. The ginger cookie overwhelms the peanut. I think I would rather make two types of cookies.  I also got way more cookies than 24, and mine look nothing like the beautiful ones in the picture!

Made for my bookkeeper at work. she Loves cookies, and I thought why not make her two varieties in one. 
Both cookies are really good on their own, and great as a duo! Got me thinking what other two cookies could I put together.
