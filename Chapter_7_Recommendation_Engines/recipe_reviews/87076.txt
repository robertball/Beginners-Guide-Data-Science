I made these for a party. There were so many reviews we tried them two nights earlier using all the different methods. Here's what I found made them great. After slicing the peppers and cleaning them out, drop in boiling water for 4 - 6 minutes. This will pretty much take all the heat out though so if you want a punch, leave the membranes. We taste tested several cream cheese flavors. We picked 3 fav's, they were the cream cheese mixed with a powdered ranch mix, or mixed with a chipotle seasoning, or mixed with worstershire and garlic powder.  (we tried 12 different flavors to get this perfect) Also, I found that 1/2 a strip of bacon was not enough - used the whole thing!  And finally after you put the pepper together with cheese and bacon and toothpick - freeze it for 15 min. Then 10 minutes on the grill is perfect. Thanks so much for the yummy appetizer!!

These are a 10!  After making these many times, I can tell you that you really need to make them ahead of time and put them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or the freezer for about 15 minutes.  This will allow the cheese to firm up a bit and it won't all leak out of your peppers.  I also have found that if you want them hot, leave all of the membrane inside and some seeds.  If you want them barely warm(like me), get almost all of the membrane out from inside the pepper and leave no seeds.  I cook them in the oven on 350 for about 45 minutes. 
***A low calorie version is use fat free cream cheese and wrap each 1/2 pepper with only 1/2 slice of bacon.  They are just as good and only about 60 calories each!!!
YUM YUM!!!

This is a great recipe - and to take some of the bite out of the peppers, I soak them in cold water after they're cut and seeded.  The longer you soak them, the milder they are.

I always use Embasa brand whole pickled jalapenos; and I use half cream cheese, half shredded cheddar or 3-cheese blend.  After wrapping with bacon and securing with a pick, I shake the whole lot in a ziploc bag with Parmesan cheese (the green can kind) and then bake at 400* til the bacon is done to your liking.  Even my stepmother, who doesn't LIKE hot stuff, makes SURE she gets her fair share of these!

We have a different variation on this recipe that came from the Marlboro Cook Like A Man Cookbook. You mix an 8oz pkg of cream cheese with 1 tbsp Cajun Seasoning and 2 tsp Garlic Pwdr. They are awesome like that! Just make sure that you always tuck the end of the bacon under where you already wrapped it or it will unravel on the grill.

VERY tasty, and SUPER easy... but 2 warnings:

1)WEAR GLOVES. As with all peppers contact with skin can leave you burning for hours. And since I was in a hurry I did just that - 4 hour later I still felt like my hands were in a fire.

2) BACON ON GRILL = FLAMES... The fat will start on fire... so be careful with your fire! Keep and eye it.

Try adding a packet of dry Ranch Dressing mix to the cream cheese before filling the peppers. We used to cook these every Thursday night for about 40-50 people and they were gone in a matter of minutes.  Still get requests for these all the time.

This was pretty good.  I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and added cajun seasoning to my cream cheese, I used half slices of bacon and I baked them.  The flavor is really good but I had problems with mine drowing in grease while they baked.  I might try elevating them on a rack next time.  ***UPDATE*** I elevated them the next time and they were really good but extremely hot.  I used some older jalapenos and they were so hot they were inedible!  Buy fresh jalapenos if you can and it will lessen the chance of getting the inedible ones.

We make these often at home.  As another user suggested, I like turkey bacon better, but some of my family prefers regular.  1/2 a piece of bacon works great, and I like to freeze the constructed peppers (spread out on a cookie sheet so they don't stick together) prior to grilling, so the cheese doesn't melt as much while the bacon is cooking.

The de-seeding is a bit of a pain, but these are very good. I simmered the peppers in boiling salted water for about 4 mins, then proceeded with the recipe. Peppers turned out tender, and the bacon was nice and crisp. Thanks!

I made a small batch of these jalapeno wraps for a test run and it was so simple and easy.  I wore gloves and glasses to protect my eyes and skin while seeding the peppers.  I sliced pieces of cream cheese off of the block and rolled them in cigarette shapes in my hands and pressed them into the peppers.  It was a fast and easy.  I wrapped each stuffed pepper with one piece of Oscar Mayer Original Center Cut bacon, secured each with a toothpick and baked them on a rack on a foil lined cookie sheet in a 400 degree preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until the bacon was crisp. They were absolutely delicious.  The peppers were cooked perfectly and had just enough heat.  The cream cheese, which baked nicely and did not run out, was a mellow contrast to the heat of the peppers and the crunchy, salty bacon finished it off nicely.  I don't think I would want to ever grill these over a flame because they cooked so evenly in the oven without the fuss and babysitting one has to tend to on a grill.  I would not bother to add any additional seasoning, etc. to the cream cheese either.  This simple 3 ingredient recipe is quite satisfying.

I've been making these forever but I never cut them in half. I make a T incision, leaving the top on, seed the peppers, stuff them and wrap them in a slice of thick bacon. If you stuff the pepper whole, the cheese won't come out and you can cook them a little longer so bacon gets really crispy and the pepper gets tender.

We've been making these for years and they are delicious!  If you don't have time, they turn out just as well in the oven.  I would recommend putting them on a rack that sits well on your baking sheet where it elevates them, then they aren't sitting in grease.  

We add grated Parmesan cheese- about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (depends on how many you are making) and mix it with the cream cheese- so good.

Also, for those looking for jalapeno peppers that don't set your mouth on fire, look through the peppers that have no "stretch-marks".  The ones that have the little tiny lines running down the skins indicate they are HOT!  :)

A great suggestion for improved results... I have been making these for a little over a year now. My guests gobble them up before any other offering of appetizer on the table. In a bowl of water, if you hold the pepper under water to remove the seeds and membrane, you won't cough from the pepper mist. Also, I pre-cook the bacon to about half done, eliminates so much grease, cooks in less time, and prevents the cream cheese from cooking out of the pepper before the bacon is done. If you want to add a mystery flavor, soak the bacon in honey before you wrap the pepper. It's delish!

Easy recipe that's simple to make and generally liked by all.  To control the heat factor, remove all the seeds and membranes, the more you remove, the less punch from the pepper....  Note of caution: Use gloves when handling the peppers or you just might live to regret it!

My friend and I served these at a chili competition that we competed in. We couldn't keep them coming off the grill fast enough. We found that it is easier to cook them if you use two skewers to hold them together instead of tooth picks. you can a bunch of them on the skewers and its easier to turn them.

Fantastic!  We used two blocks of 1/3 less fat cream cheese and mixed in 1 packet of Hidden Valley fiesta ranch mix and a little bit of cheddar cheese.  We used center cut bacon which has the same amazing flavor but so much less fat and calories.  We also put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes before cooking them.  Instead of grilling, we put them in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes and they came out perfect!

These were AMAZING!!!  Everyone LOVED them!  I will be making these pretty much any time we have people over!    I followed a few tips from some other reviews; 1) I soaked the the jalapenos in cold water over night to take the "fire" out of them 2) I put the bacon in the microwave for approx. 2 minutes before wrapping it around the peppers 3) I ended up having to bake them in the oven due to Grill issues, and did so for 25-30 minutes at 350 and finally 4) I mixed in some garlic seasonings with the cream cheese before filling the peppers.

My dad makes these with Jalapenos from our garden and usually he makes about 2 or 3 per person :)  These are super yummy!   One suggestion: Let your tooth picks soak in a dish of water for like a 1/2 hr to an hour...sometimes they can catch on fire in the grill :)

I HAVE ONLY SEEN MY HUSBAND CRY TEARS OF PURE JOY ONE OTHER TIME....and that was when his college football team WON the NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.....Yes, these bacon Jalapeno wraps are THAT GOOD!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                            TIPS:  I did boil the Jalapeno halves for 6 mins, used a packet of dry ranch dip/cream cheese/shredded Italian cheese that was leftover in fridge and mixed. I put them in the freezer for 20 mins after wrapping with bacon and put them on skewers instead of toothpicks. I grilled them on medium/high heat cheese side down until cheese began to bubble then flipped them until cheese bubbled more and then moved them to a piece of foil to continue cooking them on the grill. These were tender, low amount of heat and I did not get cheese all over the place although this can easily happen if you do not watch them cook.    Hope you and yours cry tears of joy as well!!!  UPDATE: Made these differently.  Added to cream cheese: 1 tsp of chili powder, 1/4 cup of brown  sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 Tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp liquid smoke, 1/2 cup of shredded Italian cheese or cheddar....YUMMY!!

What the heck...!!! These things aren't called Bacon Jalapeno Wraps.. 

 This is a very old BBQ recipe that's been around for as long as I can remember and it's a common treat at pro BBQ events. They are called ABT's which is short for "Atomic Buffalo Turds" eat a few and the next morning you'll know how they earned their name..   

There's got to be a 1000 different ways of making ABT's Some people stuff them with cream cheese and crayfish and some people stuff them with little smoky Joe's sausages and cream cheese. The one thing they all share in common is stuffed Jalapenos wrapped in bacon and smoked. 

My personal favorite is APT's stuffed with cream cheese, chopped mushrooms, sausage and smoked on a hot BBQ over apple and mesquite coals...

We love these.  I made a great sweet dipping sauce with apricot jelly.  I prepare my jalapeno's cleaning out the seeds and then cook on the grill.. take off let cool then add your cream cheese wrap with bacon and then cook on the grill.  This takes a lot of the heat from the peppers and my bacon was always done way before the peppers so this method lets you adjust how well done you like your peppers.

had people over for appies, these were a bit hit  :)) used Philly 'herb and garlic' creamed cheese, and I followed the suggestion and used 1/4 cup of grated parmesan (mixed parm and cream cheese in a bowl) .. I scooped out the membranes and seeds, didnt boil them at all and they weren't too spicy... next time I think I will try half of them with the membranes still in, to see how much hotter they are. Used a whole slice of bacon for each one, and even though I didnt freeze them for the recommended 15min. before cooking, I wrapped the bacon in such a way that when I got to the top of the popper, I folded the bacon over the 'head' like a hat, and used a toothpick or two to secure .. so there were no open ends for cheese to leak out. I baked them @ 350 for 45 min., on a raised rack/cooling rack on top of my baking tray, so they weren't sitting in bacon grease, it all dripped down. they came out perfect!

I am rating this recipe with five stars, but as is I really think it is four stars. My five star version of this is to use cheddar or a harder cheese. It does not melt as fast, or as fluidly as the cream cheese. To take some of the heat out of the pepper, be sure to remove all stems and seeds. That is where majority of the heat is at. I live in San Antonio, and I am surrounded by spicy food. I learned from a hispanic friend of mine that to tame some of the heat from peppers, you soak them in an ice water bath after de-seeding and stemming. I usually give them a good 30 minutes to an hour soak before constructing. Hope it helps someone out!

5 STARS !!! Delicious !  I like to add Rasberry Chipolte sauce in the jalapeno. Just add that first then put creme cheese in and wrap with bacon.  For your hands burning , pour vinegar over them and the burn will go away.

Have been making these for years....I cut them at aslight angle across the top and stuff them that way. Holds the cream cheese in better. Use a tooth pick to secure top and a starting hook to hold the bacon strip. Havent grilled them in years........Bake at 350 for 20-30 min then kick it over to broil high for 3-5 more min. to really crisp up the bacon. Leave in the seeds and/or season the cream cheese to really melt your face off.

Freezing/chilling is wise in order to set.  Another variation is to dip the wrapped pepper in brown sugar to caramelize with a touch of sweetness.  Delicious!

I used a mexican blend of shreaded cheeses. Make sure your toothpick goes through the pepper and not just through the bacon or the pepper will slide out on the grill. Also to keep the cheese from running out slice only on side of the pepper and carefully push on both ends to make it open like a change purse.

These came out great! I made them for the first time and it was easy. a lot of good tips on this recipe that helped. I like maple bacon so I used that and everyone loved it. also using a melon baller to remove the seed and membrane minimizes your hands from soaking up the hot stuff.

This is my absolute favorite way to make jalapeno poppers.  So easy and so much more flavor than the breaded and fried variety.  I like to sprinkle a little parmeasn/romano blend on top of the cream cheese for a little extra flavor.  I know I'll make these many, many times.

These were also great with Turkey bacon! Alot less fat and not greasy. Definitely freeze for 15 minutes before hand and season the cream cheese for more kick.

I have only baked this version of "jalepeno poppers". I spread cream cheese on each half and wrap with 1/2 a slice of Low-sodium bacon (for some reason I find it easier to wrap with this kind) I don't use toothpicks, don't find it necessary. I then line them up on a broiling pan so the grease drips off and the bacon crisps up nicely. I then bake them @ 400 degrees for 45-60mins. If I take them somewhere, I just layer them in my crock pot and leave them on low to keep them warm. Has been a huge hit for my family and friends!!!

Made these for an appetizer on Christmas Day.  I made these in stages so I wouldn' thave so much to do on Christmas.  I seeded the jalepeno, then blanched them so they wouldn't be too hot-spicy.  Put them in ice cold water to stop cooking and retain color, dried them and filled with cream cheese.  I cooked the bacon in oven for approx 7-10 mins, just so they start to cook a little but aren't done, then wrapped the jalepenos using one full piece of bacon and used water soaked toothpicks to hold them together.  Wrapped up the platter and refrigerated for a day & 1/2.  Simply, popped them in the oven on Christmas on 350 for 25 -30 mins and they were done perfectly....oh, even though people warn not to touch your eyes after handling jalepenos, I touched my cheek/nose area and it was potent, burned for awhile...careful.

My kids taught me this it is a favorite at their parties. JUST MAKE SURE that you do NOT remove the stem or the end just make a slit along one side or your cheese will ooze out all over your grill.
There are so many variations! we love coming up with new ones. Here are a few:
Stir into Cream Cheese before stuffing the peppers:
1 Pkg Hidden Valley Ranch mix (dry)
Shredded cooked Crab, Shrimp, or both
Sliced Green onions
Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese

You can also swap out the peppers for any other kind- sometimes we use the huge green chilies but you have to use more bacon and Cream Cheese. There are small, mild peppers also that the little kids and elderly love.
WATCH THEM Close on the grill they burn fast!

These are really good as written  but there is way too much cream cheese.  The second time I made them I made the following changes: 12 jalapenos halved, 3/4 package cream cheese, 2 tbsp salsa, and 1/4 C shredded cheese.  Do not make the mistake I did of using thick cut bacon...it doesn't get crispy enough.  I baked at 400 f for about 35 minutes.  Really yummy!!

I have been making these on the smoker for years.  add a lil smokie link between the cream cheese and bacon, and they'll be the hit of your party.  1 pkg. cream cheese, 20 jalapenos, along with 1 pound bacon and 1 pkg little smokies works out perfectly.  Nothing to throw out or try to use in something else.

I thought these were good, but I needed a little more kick.  My husband thought they were just fine with the cream cheese,but I decided to try the recipe with pepper jack cheese.  I liked it spicer.  Also, since we're not much on grilling, I would sugest broiling.  Very yummy in general!

I love these.. they are really good.              Try a Colby Monteray Jack Cheese in place of the cream cheese. also try freezing them before cooking does not change the taste at all.  This keeps the cheese from melting and running out as the bacon cooks, and it is melted through when the bacon is done.

Warning: do not try to grill these on a Foreman.  It will not work.  After a first failed attempt, I baked them for 45 min at 350 degrees like someone else suggested.  These came out much nicer!  I used 2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tbsp Cajun spicing in the cream cheese. Put them in the freezer for 15 minutes to let the cream cheese harden up.  An awesome snack for a cold winter night.

Love these! I liked them better baked in the oven then broiled for a minute to brown the bacon. Too messy on the grill and the bacon burned easily. I brushed them with peach jam to add a little sweetness. I followed others by putting them in the freezer before cooking. Worked out well.

We have been making these for years.  The one thing that we do different is mix equal parts cream cheese and shredded cheddar to stuff them.  We have also frozen them and used them when we are grilling in the winter.  They work great!  Just pull them out when you light the grill and they are ready to go when the grill is hot.

We make these all year round, but we use a grilling basket~MUCH EASIER!!  Also, I cut the bacon strips in half & it's plenty. We use different variations with the cream cheese. Sometimes we mix in garlic powder & Tony Chachere's, sometimes bleu cheese crumbles & also crushed pineapple mixed in. The possibilities are endless!  ENJOY!!

These were surprisingly easy to make and were a huge hit at my Labor Day BBQ. Instead of grilling, I backed them in my convection oven at 375 for about 10 minutes per side (started with 'cheese side' down, then flipped after 10 minutes). When they were done, the bacon was crisp and the peppers were soft. I also used half a piece of bacon per pepper.

This is a really good recipe, and the version that I tasted the very first time a couple of years ago used MAPLE smoked bacon...WOW! Sweet, heat, and salt. It doesn't get much better than that.


UPDATE DECEMBER 2011: my family did these (again) for the holidays...only we made another change. PEANUT BUTTER instead of cream cheese! Oh, we did the cheese, too...but made a few experimental changes. OMG! Sooo good! You might think it doesn't sound good, but try it! We did them in the oven at 400 degrees.

The yummiest way we have found to do these, is to follow the directions, but after you have wrapped them in bacon, roll them in a mixture of 1 c. brown sugar mixed with 1 Tbls. chili powder.  Then cook.  We have baked them on a broiler pan at 400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes, or until bacon is crisp.  There is never any left and everyone wants the recipe!!!

These are very good.  But after slicing in 1/2 and cleaning the peppers, I blanched them in boiling water for 2 minutes and removed to an ice bath.  I'm not a big fan of biting into raw jalapeños.  I also served with a sweet pineapple salsa which really brought the dish together - sweet, spicy, and salty.  Medium heat worked for me; high heat burns them by extracting the cream cheese out causing flames.
Alternatively, I would like to try to partially bake the bacon to - cooked but still limp- wrapping the pepper and then broiling until crisp.

This recipe is fantastic - a real crowd pleaser.  Before stuffing, I blanche the cleaned pepper halves for about 4 min. then place in an ice water bath.  I use neufchatel cream cheese to cut the fat calories, and add about 2 tblsp. ground cumin and fresh cilantro.  I wrap with turkey bacon (the crowd consensus is that it cooks up crispier).  I freeze them overnight, then to cook - I place on a low rack and broil about 8-9 minutes.  Voila!  Yummy - there are NEVER any leftovers.

These are sooo good. If you remove all of the seeds and ribs from the peppers, they're not spicy at all. I like to mix grated cheese and assorted herbs and spices to the cream cheese.

Out of this world good.  I impressed everyone with this!  I did wear gloves when i de-seeded but only because I have a baby and didn't want to get anything on her.  I made them the day before, refrigerated for 24 hours and baked them in the oven.  Delicious!  They were not hot at all tho, I may try leaving some seeds next time, or not refrigerating before hand.

It's Just Ok, but it tastes better if you mix cheddar cheese into the cream cheese for more flavor.

One problem with this recipe. 
They are so good everyone wants them as the main course! I make them all the time. And cook them in the oven. Prepare them and chill for an hour or so. Then put them in a pre heated 400 oven, upsit down. Turn them over and broil 1/2 though. YUMMY!

To easily deseed the jalapenos, use a melon baller to scrape out the insides. Also, instead of firing up the grill, you can use the George Foreman.

These are so good! I followed the recipe, but before I wrapped the jalapeño I popped the bacon in the microwave for a couple of minutes to cook it about half way, then I let the bacon cool and wrapped the jalapeño. After they were finished, I stuck them in the freezer for about a half hour. Since the bacon was semi cooked I didn't have to grill them as long. This was the first time I have made poppers and the filling didn't melt all over the place.

One of my favorites, make these several times of year.  Usually make 2-3 dozen for a party so it is a time investment for sure.  Main suggestion I would have that I always do is add a piece or two of shrimp (or cooked chicken) prior to wrapping.  If you like it hot, leave in the white stuff and the seeds.  I usually do half and half.  I don't use gloves because I think they are a pain but be sure to wash your hands PRIOR to using the bathroom, not just after!  My dad helped last year and he ended up doing the hot pants dance.

Other suggestions...I like using thick bacon.  Pepper crusted is best but Maple will do.  Don't use those wussy toothpicks, get the bigger ones.  Use full fat cream cheese and a good brand, don't use the generic or fat free - it comes out like plastic.  These are also best if you can cook them in indirect heat on your smoker for about an hour and then move them to over a medium heat to crisp the bacon.  Don't put directly over a high heat as they will need CONSTANT attention not to ruin them.

Also - Try using OTHER larger peppers too, just core, don't split.  fill with the cream cheese and shrimp.  wrap a couple pieces of bacon.

Mixing spices into the cream cheese sounds good!  I will try it.

These are so good! I went ahead and added a packet of Ranch dressing after I read some of the reviews and some one suggested it, it was a great tip! It gave them way more flavor. One thing I will mention is always use thin cut bacon! I only had thick cut the first time I made these and my grill caught on fire! It ruined the entire batch! They were so burned! Oh! Also if you don't want the jalapeños really, really hot,  let them soak in cold water for a couple of minutes before stuffing.

Good basic recipe. I boil the peppers for a couple minutes to make them slightly less spicy. I also do half cream cheese, half shredded cheddar. My husband isn't a huge cream cheese fan so I swap half of it...it makes the filling taste like cheddar but still have a creamy texture. After I form the poppers I put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes. I find that freezing them helps the bacon crisp up without the filling melting out too quickly!

Made these for my Dad and I at Easter and we loved em. Scanned through a few suggestions and the freezing them first is a great idea, prevents the cheese from melting and making a mess of the grill. Two suggestions: make sure the peppers are not to big, length wise, other wise the Bacon will not wrap around totally. Second:When you first put them on the grill put them cheese side down on low heat. Once the bacon is done to your liking flip them over and do the bottom. This way the cheese will not melt and mess the grill and two if you just put them on the bottom the bottom bacon will burn as by then the cheese is starting to melt and will run out. This is a good way to get evenly cooked bacon and no melted cheese. We tried it with Smoked salmon cheese and was surprising quiet tasty. Next time I will try a herb cheese. thnx for sharing this peppery delight.

I have mad these several times and they are always a huge hit. I bake mine in the oven on 375 for 50 minutes and flip them over half way. I also put them on a grate on a cookie sheet so they dont sit in the bacon grease that drips off. Perfect!

Use a wire rack to cook them on...
even thou it takes slightly longer to cook, I prefer baking in the oven - or under the grill - not the BBQ - have too many other things going on at the same time and bacon flare ups are a pain in the :O .  That said...  best tip is to bake/grill in the oven BUT place them on a wire rack on a cookie sheet. This way they are not sitting in the grease which can now drip below. Foil on the sheet also makes a far easier clean up! Hot summer? don't want to use the oven? Baked them on the upper rack of bbq, still on a wire racked sheet. Times will vary depending on what else you are cooking. 

A previous reviewer said they used salmon flavoured creme cheese - WOW - fantastic. I use a different flavour ingredient almost every time. What ever I have handy. None have been failures! 

BTW, poblanos work well too... just a slightly different cooking time, depending on your filling. But the larger size gives you such a variety of choices for fillings.
Miss G. good post! delish!

These are amazing, have been making them for a few years now. I tend to use Chive & Onion cream cheese. Also another trick to help with those who don't like the heat is to soak the seeded jalapeno peppers in ice water.

I didn't have much of any ingredient, but they sounded so good I had to try them.  After reading the reviews, I parboiled the 3 jalepenos for 4 minutes and fried the bacon in a pan until it was tender crisp.  I filled with cream cheese with chives and froze the pepper and cheese for 15 minutes.  I wrapped in bacon and oven heated at 400 for 10 minutes.  In my opinion...perfect!

I don't cut them in half, i cut the stems off and core out the middle.  Core out as much as you possibly can otherwise they can be too hot, but this way, you do retain a bit of heat/pop.  Start the bacon wrap as a cap where the stem was, and then wrap and toothpick.  Grill the same as this recipe calls for.

we made these except we cut the tops off and added hickory smoked pulled pork to the cream cheese. Then puts the tops back on them wrapped with the bacon and coated them in a flour, salt, and pepper mixture and deep fried them for about 10 min. And they were delicious!

These were really good! I kept feeling like they were to simple and I needed to add something more to spice them up....until I ate one. These are fantastic as is. I gotta be honest that I still might try mixing ranch mix in with the cream cheese later next time just to compare but they are fantastic just the way they are.  I tried a half slice of bacon and it unraveled as it shrank. These definitely need a full strip as the recipe calls for.

Pretty good.... I should have stuck to the recipe but instead added ranch dip seasoning like other viewers mentioned... this made it way too salty, and I like salty. Next time will make it without.  Cooked the bacon a bit before wrapping....

been making these for years . if u want to add a good taste mix dill in with the cream cheese and after wrapping the bacon around them  put soy sauce all over them and then sprinkle black pepper and kosher salt and cayenne pepper on then then let sit in fridge for about a hour. i make them about twice a week and usually make 150 of them a time and give to family members and friends. Also these are great when they are cold take them and chop them up and put them in a omelette you won't regret it . probably one of the best omelettes i have ever made

the hubs makes these all the time and we love them.sometimes when he is removing them from the outdoor grill, he will brush a small amount of quality bar-b-q on some of them. i prefer them without it but he likes it with. a trick a very good friend of ours taught us(he is from mexico)is to roll the jalapenos for a minute on your cutting board before cutting and stuffing. the pepper will release more oils and will retain the heat of the pepper. it works!we live in texas and he has taught us so many tips and recipes to cook some great mexican food.i am getting hungry thinking about these peppers!

Very good! I added a little bit of garlic powder and Mexican cheese blend to the cream cheese, but I think it would've been just as great without. Plan on making these again!

Just like with the bacon wrapped shrimp, it is best to first cook the bacon till edible (but flexible), then wrap for the grill to avoid overcooking the cheese.

These things are addictive!  I made one small change, I cut the stem end off the pepper and cleaned out the inside, this allowed the cheese to stay put better.  Also lay slice of bacon over the top of pepper and secure with a toothpick.

These are perfect for football or gathering. I make them all the time....but most of the time I just bake them in the oven. I bake them for 30-45 mins at 350. This usually cooks the spicy hotness out of the jalapeno.....because I am a whimp and do not like super spicy food. ;)

Haven't tried, but can taste this in my head, and it's great,   Have a question, though:  has anyone tried these using canned jalapenos?  We don't live in an area where grocery stores carry them often if at all.

I stuff the peppers with my crab dip (cream cheese based) it is favorite of all!  The neighbors always request i bring them to any event!  I like the idea of cutting a T in the pepper to avoid melting out.  I will be making 24+ tonight

We first tried this recipe over ten years ago and have never gotten tired of it. Even the kids can tolerate the spicyness :) we save the seeds to add to soup etc.

WOW gotta try this at a BBQ. I wonder if I cooked them in the oven I would recieve similar results. I'll have to get the ingredients next time I grocery shop & find out. I already gave this 5 star cause its simple plus a combination of bacon & jalepeno poppers you can never go wrong! I'll update though how it turns out in the oven, save the grill for when the men want to heat it up.

These were a huge hit. I made them as stated in the recipe.  I took the advise of others and baked them on low in the oven for about an hour on a rack.  This crisped the bacon perfectly and the cheese did not melt out.  Also take the advise and wear gloves while prepping these.  I cleared all of the seeds and membranes and they still had a kick...which is what we like.  I will make these again and again!

I Love this recipe and make all the time! Couple of tips I use to perfect this recipe, wear gloves, use cold cream cheese it forms better in pepper, instead of grilling put on foiled line sheet in the oven 350 for 45 minutes the bacon will crisp and the cheese won't melt out

I leave whole and use a peeler to deseed the inside. Take a baggie or pastry bag to fill with cream cheese. Wrap with bacon and grill. If weather is not permitting, works in the oven too.

Wonderful!  Changes:  1 - Drop peppers in boiling water for 6 minutes to reduce heat, 2 - wear gloves when working with the peppers before boiling them.  I made my own flavored cream cheese by adding garlic powder, onion salt, and chives.  Also added handfuls of shredded mexican cheese blend to double the recipe.  Cooked in oven as it was raining when I made these.  Cooked at 400 degrees till bacon was cooked to my liking, about 25 minutes.  I also used a whole stip of thinly slice bacon.  When wrapping them, stretch the bacon so that it really wraps tight and keeps the stuffing inside.  One last addition was to pull them out right before they were done and put some grated asiago  cheese on top.  pop them back in the oven to melt and slightly brown.

I love the bacon wrapped idea. The only thing I changed is that my usual popper filling is half cream cheese and half sharp cheddar....I like the cheddar mix better.The tough part is doing these on the grill/having to turn them over and do both sides to crisp the bacon without the cheese leaking out. I put a bacon"flap" over the end first and then wrapped....that worked pretty well....I only had 2 leakers. Next time I  might try stuffing a whole pepper and wrap with bacon....will be easier to keep the cheese in......great flavor though

This is great - as is almost anything wrapped in bacon and grilled over hot coals!  One suggestion - try "queso fresca" (fresh Mexican cheese) instead of the cream cheese - it doesn't melt.

Great recipe, thanks so much. I added sour cream and garlic to my cheese to suit our tastes, big hit.

Definately freeze before grilling, and have a squirt bottle handy cause bacon grease likes to flare up.

A family favorite anytime!  If you're not grilling, you can also make these in standard oven.  Preheat oven to 400F.  Prep peppers as for grill.  Place prepared peppers on a rack in a foil lined shallow baking pan & bake for ~20 mins., (until bacon is cooked/crisp & peppers are softened).

So DELICIOUS!! Easy ingredients and even easier to make. Recommendation: if you're serving for a party, do not go for colored toothpicks, as the color will leak into the cream cheese.

I've been fixing these for football games, family get togethers, etc for a few years now. I cook them in the oven during winter months. It takes about 30-45 minutes on 400 to get them done. Takes a while but sooo worth the wait. My family and kids love them.

So good!  Wow.  I cut the cream cheese into little blocks and then froze it while I cut the peppers.  I only needed half a bacon slice per pepper.  After wrapping them and skewering them with toothpicks, I put them back in the freezer for about fifteen minutes to firm up.  Then into a 400 degree oven for about 25 minutes.  Let them cool for 5-10 minutes while draining on paper towels.  Will definitely be getting heavy rotation on my appetizer list!

These are a 10! I put them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or the freezer for about 15 minutes.  The cheese firms up a little and it doesn't leak out of the peppers. I also have found that if you want them hot, leave all of the membrane inside and some seeds. If you want them barely warm, get almost all of the membrane out from inside the pepper and leave no seeds. I bak them in the oven on 350 for about 45 minutes.

This was a delicious recipe. I gave it 4 stars because it was difficult to cook. On the grill, the bacon created a large fire, and was hard to control. However, when the cooking was done, these had a strong presentation, were enjoyed by my guests (althought they were curious about the combo), and the cream cheese stayed in the pepper, to my amazement. Nice creative side dish/appetizer for BBQ night.

My friend turned me on to these about a year ago.  I make them all the time.  I am vegetarian so I use Morning Star Bacon for ours and regular Bacon for our guests.  I don't do them on the grill.  I bake them in the oven at 375 for about 20 mins (until bacon is crispy).  To reduce heat of jalapeno and for convience, you can pre-make them (don't cook), then freeze them and pull out and cook when guests come over.

My husband makes these almost every time we have company over, and they always get rave reviews.  When we aren't able to grill, we cook them in the oven on 350.  Sometimes we let them cook for a while in the oven, and then pop them on the grill at the very end.  We usually use regular cream cheese, and then also do a batch with pineapple cream cheese.  So yummy!  Also, if you are looking to reduce the heat of the peppers don't just remove the seeds - make sure you remove the veins as well.

Awesome recipe.  Not quite spicy enough so I sprinkled cayene on them when they came out and I brushed them with seedless blackberry jam right at the very end to add a little sweetness....pretty good.  I started them on the grill and finished them in the oven.  Next time, I'll just put them in the oven.  My husband loved them.  I'll make again.  I was impressed the cheese mixture did not ooze out as much as I expected.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe, Melissa.

The way this recipe is written, it lacks enough flavor for us (hence the 3 star review).  However, I made some changes that seriously made this one of the best jalapeno popper recipe of all time.  I used about 4 ounces cream cheese and 4 ounces finely shredded Mexican cheese blend.  Then I added 1/2 tsp seasoned salt, 1/2 tsp dried parsley, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, and a dash of thyme.  I froze them for about 20 minutes prior to grilling them on high for about 4-5 minutes on each side.  They were delicious.  We sat there and stuffed ourselves even after we were full because we couldn't stop eating them.

I just saw this recipe but have made it many times. It's a great recipe but this person left out one of the most important parts; Eat them with a homemade style jam, it offsets the heat and gives it a good finishing touch. I suggest raspberry or peach.

These are fantastic!  Now this is what I bring to all the family/holiday get togethers.  Everyone loves them and they're so simple to make!  I've also learned you can put them in the oven at 200 - 300 degrees and keep them in there for awhile, them come out great.  The lower the heat and longer they stay in the oven, the better they come out.  (That is, if you don't have a grill handy/heated.)

These were a big hit. I cooked on a cookie sheet in oven for about 40 min. They turned out perfect.  Definitely will make again.

These are dangerous!  I mixed shredded cheddar in with the cream cheese and I baked these in the oven (425) for about 25 minutes.  Yum.  Could've eaten all of them myself.  Will be making these again!

I made these with pre-cooked bacon.  I softened peppers in oven for about 10 minutes before stuffing them, and then threw them in the oven. They were tasty and not too greasy.

These tasted great, but they were pretty messy & not very appetizing looking.  Next time I will heed the advice of prior reviewers and freeze them for a bit before grilling to see if that keeps the cheese from "oozing" out.  I'll also leave some membrane/seeds for a little more bite (though my peppers were also exceptionally large and I've been told the larger the pepper, the less bite?).  UPDATE:  Just made these again today w/extra jalaps from Jalapeno Chicken II and put them in the frig for awhile before grilling...had NO issues w/the good stuff oozing out on the grill-it all stayed neatly inside the pepper where it belongs.  ;)

This is a staple at all BBQ's here. We marinade Fajita meat till its real tender, then cook it, chop it up and stuff the peppers. Also, add shrimp or shredded chicken with dry ceazar dressing mix to the cream cheese, then stuffem.

Excellent stuff. When I cleaned the peppers I saved the seeds and put them in the cream cheese and added some garlic powder for a hotter taste.

Awesome flavor, I prefer pickled jalapenos myslelf as they are more tender. I never seem to get the fresh jalapenos tender before the bacon is done.

I made these when i had my family over they loved them. I get creative and add some lobster in mine and some chives . I add four different cheese to. They were so good i had to make more. I tried three different bacon and i do love the thick bacon because it gives the jalapeno a wonderful taste. I use two packages of cream cheese and sour cream to for different ones .   If you make these your family and friends would love them. They will be hooked.

Oh, baby, what a winner!

I sliced off the stem end of the pepper and scooped out the ribs and seeds.  This results in an "open" end of the pepper.  Best to use gloves, or an unwanted guest, for cutting and cleaning your peppers.  ; )

Tips:  
1). After scooping out the pepper, return the seeds by mixing into the cream cheese.

2)  Refrigerate for several hours, or overnight, to firm up the cream cheese.  ( I let the cream cheese soften so I could mix in the seeds and the suggested dried ranch dressing mix, which was delicious.)

3)  Wrap bacon over the open end of the pepper to keep the contents contained.

4). Cook pepper cream cheese side down first, then flip.  The temp of the grill will soften the cream cheese, so this will prevent it from oozing out of the pepper.  This is also why you should wrap the open end of the pepper.

I will experiment in the future with other cream cheese flavors. Enjoy!

Made them for my hubby and his pals the week before our wedding... stuck around and had some myself.. awesome!!!!  Did one half of them with plain cream cheese and the other half I mixed the ranch dip mix with the cream cheese before filling them. Also found that putting the softened cream cheese into a storage bag and cutting off the tip made it fast and easy to fill the peppers and I cut the bacon in half and stretched it a bit as I wrapped each pepper. It made it go a lot farther and cooked a little faster having a half piece bacon vs a full piece for each one...

Made these last night and they were a big hit.  Used fresh peppers and removed seeds/membranes.  Added some canned diced green chilies and diced ham to the cream cheese, and per one reviewer's suggestion, used a pair of skewers to double-pierce each jalapeno for grilling.  I think the diced ham was not noticeable therefore unnecessary, but the green chilies addition was nice, although I think the filling could still use a little more flavoring.  The peppers were fairly large so I used full slice of thick bacon per jalapeno and the double skewering idea worked great.  The charcoal fire was real hot so grilled on the fringe, which prevented flare-ups, and experienced minimal cheese oozing but needed to keep an eye on them to prevent bacon burn.  We loved the fresh jalapeno flavor with a nice little spice bite.  While the prep work was a little much, it was worth it if you have the time and want to impress.  I expect these will become a regular addition to dinner parties.

Awesome recipe which my hubby enjoyed. Only different thing I did was take a tip from a reviewer and do a T cut on the pepper , clean up the inside a bit,stuff it with cheese and close it shut with two strips of bacon wrapped around the whole pepper. Nicer presentation and the cheese stayed mostly inside. Baked them for 30 or so minutes in a 400f oven.

I made this recipe for a small BBQ with friends.  They loved it! They all told me I have to make this again, like I didn't have an option not to.  The only thing I did that I didn't see in any other suggestion was precook the bacon a little in the oven.  It got crispier on the BBQ that way.

I pre-soaked the jalapenos for about 20 minutes after seeding them as I do not like super spicy food. That was enough time to remove most of the heat. The flavor was excellent.

Yummy!  I baked mine at 450 for 15-20 mintues.  I added grated cheddar cheese, garlic powder and Worchestershire sauce to the cream cheese.  Chilled them for at least 2 hours before baking.  Will make these again...and again. Update: made these again already for company and they were gone in minutes!  Do yourself a favour and make these.

These are amazing and are a hit every time we make them.  People actually ask us to bring them if we are invited to a potluck.  However, we use Prosciutto instead of bacon.  It's easier because the prosciutto is the same width and the jalapeno and you need the same number of slices as there are peppers.  Also, no need for the toothpick cause prosciutto stays once rolled.

Tried these several times with many different variations. Expensive, fancy bacon is a waste of money. Regular Bar S tasted best. Cajun seasoning can make them too hot for some people, but is a great tweak, depending on how spicy it is. And here's the killer twist......put fresh mango slices in with the cream cheese! Or fresh pineapple! OH YEAH! (Also, try different flavored cream cheeses for a change up.)

These were great and easier to prepair that I thought they would be.  Had in the fridge for a few hours, baked in the oven for about 15 minutes and finished on the grill.  Delicious!!

Two things -- being originally from Texas, we of course, think we invented this. HOWEVER -- we add a peeled, deveined shrimp to every jalapeño. Between the cream cheese and the bacon. Also, spice up the cream cheese with a little finely chopped onion or garlic or both. Wrap grill. Yummy, yum yum!!!

I do these in the oven at 425 for 30 min.  I also add some shredded Cheddar cheese to the cream cheese mixture.  They are so good and guaranteed to be a hit at any function.  I now must bring them to every family gathering we have!

Wow! These were so great. I made this for a BBQ and everybody was raving about how tasty they were. I took advice from other reviews and blanched the jalapenos before stuffing them. I love spicy food, but I'm really sensitive to it...like even mild salsa makes my nose run, but after blanching the jalapenos, it was a perfect balance between mildly spicy and smoky from the bacon. Will definitely make these again.

This appetizer was a hit!  The recipe is so simple and the prep time so fast, yet the end result looks and tastes like something that took a long time to prepare. We used the Recipe ingredients as-is, covered each Jalapeno half w/ a full slice of bacon, froze for 15-min. to harden the cream cheese, and grilled on 350F (gas grill) for 10 to 15-min. We learned that turning the Jalapenos on the grill, open-side down, made the cream cheese leak out. So don't turn them over. Grill them bottom-side of the Jalapeno down.

These were AMAZING. I used two packs cream cheese, a handful of cheddar cheese, a dash of Parm, some garlic powder and two tablespoons of worchestire sauce.  I baked them at 350 for twenty minutes. Broiled them for three minutes then turned them and broiled for another three minutes. They were gone before I could set down the tray. This is a new favorite!!

These are always a hit. I usually add fresh chives and garlic and mix with blender till smooth. Then hand stir in cooked mini salad shrimp. I will have to try cajun seasoning next time. These also freeze real well to use on a later date. Great party food!!!!

So simple and so good! I think it's even better if you chop the bacon up, cook it and add it to the cream cheese inside. YUM!

I think just about everyone has made these from one recipe or another.  This is just the basic recipe.  What I do is just a tad different but seems to add so much more flavored to me.  I use half cream cheese and half grated cheddar cheese mixed together with 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce .  Wrap in one full slice of bacon each.  I never par-boil the peppers.  Thats for wimps.  I like my peppers hot and to still have a tad of crunch.  We liked them a lot better with the cheddar.  Lol ;-()

F A B U L O U S versatile basic recipe..  I went a little beyond plain cream cheese by folding in a shredded mexican cheese blend, a dash of worcestershire, garlic & onion powder to make a tasty cream cheese mixture to stuff the peppers.   Cheers!  They were awesome!  No leftovers here and the family is begging for more.

pretty darn good! The one mistake I made when grilling these was not putting tin foil on the grill...the bacon drippings would drip on the charcoal causing flames to shoot up which in turn made the bacon crispy on the outside with the bacon chewy on the inside [the parts that got wrapped first] i will definitely use tin foil next time for a more even grilling...

These were fantastic! After stuffing the peppers with cream cheese, I added a thin slice of cheddar cheese to each one & sprinkled them all with cajun seasoning. Then wrapped each pepper with half a slice of bacon (a whole slice seemed like it would've been too much) I covered a cookie sheet with foil, and baked then in the oven at 400 degrees until they were crisp to our taste. Had no need to turn them either. My husband said they were wonderful & that I'd definitely have to make them again!

My neighbor makes these all the time. He makes a variety pack, so to speak, using different cheese like cheddar, pepper jack, and cream cheese. He salts the  peppers for a little more heat and wow, its a delicious punch. I cannot wait to make these myself.

I kinda added my own flare by adding the following ingredients to the cream cheese mixture: ranch powder, shredded pepper jack cheese, and homemade bacon bits. It is so yummy! I make these on every float trip!

These are an all time favorite in our house! I have to say that I do not follow this recipe, but it's a great guideline for a great appetizer.  
I take a small can of crushed pineapples and drain them.  I mix cajun seasoning with the cream cheese and crushed pineapples.  The sweet balances out a lot of the heat from the peppers.  I also bake them on 350 and then Broil on low to make the bacon crispy instead of using the grill.

What I love about this recipe (besides how tasty it is) is that you can have the peppers halved and seeded before guests arrive and when someone asks you what they can do to help, you can have them fill in the cream cheese and wrap the bacon around them.  These are always a crowd pleaser!

I made these to the letter, I changed nothing in the method nor the ingredients so I could fairly rate it. Well, I brought them to a party, the plate was cleaned up withing minutes. So that is a good indicator that the recipe is awesome. They are perfect as is, so thank you for posting this recipe.

These were easy and very tasty.  They were enormously popular at a football party we took them to. You should slice the peppers and pull out the insides to make room for the cream cheese.  I sliced each fresh pepper longways, and then wore some food prep gloves and just dug in with my hands to clean them out.   I used only one piece of thicker sliced bacon on each pepper and it worked well.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  We took this to a football party, and I made 24.  It took 2-8 oz. blocks of cream cheese to do 24 peppers.

I've been making them for years with a cream cheese/chorizo(mexican sausage)mix about 50/50 each, we don't always know how hot the peppers will be so after cleaning you can soak them on cold salty water the longer they sit on this the milder they'll be. Wearing gloves is highly recomended while coring cleaning peppers. Precook your chorizo on a nonstick pan untill nice and brown, let cool. mix it with cream cheese and than stuff peppers, wrap'em with bacon and let sit on fridge if time allowes you to. Enjoy and be ready to pass recipe since everybody will LOVE them.

I added garlic chunks and a little bit of shredded cheddar to the cream cheese. Amazing!

AMAZING!  I changed up the recipe a little (after reading reviews).  I used 4 ounces of cream cheese, less than 1/4 c shredded cheddar cheese, a dash of garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp ranch seasoning.  I only used 5 jalapenos, and 10 slices of bacon (cut the bacon in 1/2). I then put them on a broiling pan and baked them at 350.  It took a long time to cook them (some longer than others depending on the size).  A couple of times, I took out of the oven, pulled back the bacon, and realized it needed longer to cook.  The bacon never did get real crispy, yet these jalapenos were so delicious!  I would definitely make these again!
Oh, and I had a little bit of filling left over.  So I halved cherry tomatoes, took out the seeds, filled them and baked them at the same time as the jalapenos.  DELICIOUS!

As written, these are pretty flavorless (but spicy:)  ).  Flavored cream cheese is a MUST (store bought, or flavor your own).  Also, depending on the size of the jalepeno, you may want to use 1/2 slice bacon.

This is a wonderful concept, though.

Love these puppies. Instead of freezing them before grilling, I prefer to pre-cook the bacon halfway so that the top gets cooked all the way through without having to turn them over on the grill, causing the cheese to melt out.

Made these last night for a family BBQ - they were gone in an instant!  After removing the seeds and membrane, I put the peppers in ice water and refridgerated overnight.  Stuffed the peppers early in the day then put in freezer for 30 minutes before cooking.  Baked in 400 degree oven for about an hour (my peppers were huge) and they were delicious!  Served them with homemade Hot Pepper Jelly!  Didn't change a thing with ingredients.

Took readers advice and placed in freezer for 15 to 20 minutes before grilling.  I removed the seed only and left the membrane. Wasn't too hot, but gave it a lil kick.

WEAR GLOVES while working with the jalapenos!!  You've been warned.  And if you still didn't listen...use rubbing alcohol to help the burning to stop.  Boiling the 'penos for 4 minutes definitely helped take the hotness out of them. Enjoy!

These were awesome!  We used turkey bacon and froze them as some others suggested.  To get tne seeds out without the hassle...cut them in half, then take a spoon and press and scrape from top to bottom of the pepper and all of the seeds and membrane will b gone. Also to protect your fingers from the heat, coat them with oil...when you are finished both the oil and the hot juice will wash right off.

We've been making these for a long time but a bit different, a little more flavorful... for the cheese filling use cream cheese, shredded cheddar cheese, brown sugar, fresh garlic, kc master piece steak seasoning.  Add ingredients to taste.  To spice them up more, mince up some of the sponge membrane from the jalapeno and add to the mix.  We also slow cook ours on the grill.  They are a hit every time.

These poppers are excellent!  Ive been making them like this for years, though lately Ive been stuffing the jalapeno with cream cheese AND a lil' smokie sausage before I wrap it in bacon.  They are a hit at every party I bring them to.

I make these several times a year,love them. I mince fresh onion and put garlic granules with my cream cheese. I also use the precooked bacon (I buy the large packages from Sams Club) and use the whole slice. I bake them in the oven on a broiler pan, therefore the grease cooks out and runs into the bottom of the pan.  With precooked bacon there is not nearly as much grease. I have tried other cheese and prefer cream cheese altho jalapeno cheese is pretty good. A trick I have found works good for seeding peppers is to cut them in half lengthwise and using a pointy teaspoon, start at the end and scrape seeds toward the stem end. Always use rubber gloves when working with hot peppers. I found out the hard way years ago!!  I will try the ranch dressing on some this time. I am doing up about 5-6 # for the 4th of July. Will freeze them ahead of time.

We have made these for years at every BBQ and they always get fought over!!!  We don't halve them though, just put a slice down one side and use your (GLOVED) finger to scrape out the seeds, then stuff.  You don't lose as much of the cheese that way.

Another option is to use milder Banana Peppers.  They are equally awesome, add a whole different flavor to the mix and aren't so hot.

Good flavor combination but difficult to prepare on the grill.  I had to finish them in the oven.  Next time I will try in the oven only, on a broiling pan.

Yummy!!  I made minor changes.  Added dry ranch and cheddar to the cream cheese.  Make sure to use thin bacon....the thick takes too long to cook!  Also cooked in the oven on a rack in a jelly roll pan then crisped under broiler for a minute.  Can't get enough!!!

These were fantastic! I added worchestire, shredded cheddar and garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture. Grilled in a jalapeno pan but I think baking and then broiling would crisp the bacon up nicely.

Very very good! Raves everytime!  I can't believe my little girl liked it. A little pain to put together for bigger crowds but it's so worth it. Try not to bite close to the stem though. For some heat, leave the insides if you dare. Also followed other suggestions and added dry ranch mix to it, starting with about 2 teaspoon; baked it on a flat roasting pan at 375-400.

Yummy!  We have made this version for quite a while, but I took the advice of others changed the recipe up a bit.  First after taking the seeds out, I boiled the jalapenos for a few min.  I like mine with a bit of a kick but not too much.  I also used another's suggestion and added the dry ranch powder to the cream cheese.  Very good!  I will have to try the garlic and worcestercire next time.  I also used the oven this time.  350 for 25 minutes.  After that, I then popped them in the broiler for a few more minutes.  My bacon just needed a little extra browing.  Yum Yum!  One step I think is a must is to pop em in the freezer before cooking.  I didn't do it this time and the cream cheese did ooze out.  But delish anyways!

These were okay,..my family thought they were pretty bland.  I would make again, but next time, will add some garlic powder and cheddar cheese to the cream cheese for more taste.

I just made this recipe at a Padre game and it was like I couldn't cook them fast enough. Everytime I took them of the grill they were gone within 2 minutes. I read all the other reviews and decided that everyone has there own way of doing things. I prefer to cook them the way the recipe says to cook them. I like using a whole piece of bacon. I would suggest that when you are at the market buying jalapenos that you look to get ones that are short and fat. This way it makes it easy to handle and the bacon wraps around the pepper 2 times and almost holds the creamcheese in. For some I would say you might to cook this one a couple of times to get the hang of it cause might get discouraged if they over cook and all the cheese heats up and melts out of the pepper and bacon. Go slow and turn them alot and when you see the cheese running out they are most likley done. Remember you can always take them off of the grill and place them back on after the cheese has cooled down. Go Padres, Go Chargers!!!!

With the tips of other reviewers - adding cajun seasoning, freezing for 15 min baking at 350 - this recipe gets *****!  I only use half a slice of bacon per popper and I use center cut bacon as it is a lot less fatty.  I also mix a little fine shreddeded cheddar in the mixture.  Delish!

I hae made these so many times but reviewed them under a different entry on this site. In large quantities they can be very time consuming but they are worth every moment spent.
I have made a modification. Before wrapping the peppers I soak the bacon in honey. It gives them a sweet taste to balance out the heat. It also gives them a nice glaze. 
I always start with extra peppers so we can nibble on them before I actually put them on the table to serve.
We just love these things!

I make these all the time but I don't barbeque them. I bake them in an oven at 350 for about 30 minutes--depending on the size of the peppers. I place the peppers on a wire rack(cookie cooling type) in a sheet pan so the peppers aren't floating in bacon grease. Also we love the taste of the peppers so I cut the slice of peppers into quarters, wrapping each quarter around 1/2 a pepper that is stuffed with the cream cheese.  The flavored cream cheeses are also good to use.

some people,I guess are just predisposed to changing everything they do.  I, on the other hand, as a professionsl chef, am no. 
When I find a recipe that is perfect, in and of itself,I prepare it as is.  Such is this recipe.
It is great, well balanced and produces an excellant appetizer.
Leave it alone, folks!! It's great,as is.

These have been a big hit! I could not find fresh peppers when I was shopping, so I used the canned pickled ones - and after trying this with fresh peppers I am sticking with the picked ones. I agree with others who have said the fresh ones are very bland tasting! My grocery store was out of picked jalapenos, but they had roasted chipotles in adobe sauce - so I used them instead-a little messier to clean out and stuff - but WOW were they good!!! Best appetizer ever!!!

Great recipe...to send this one over the top, I chop about 1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes packed in olive oil and some fresh basil (in my mini food chopper) and mix with the cream cheese. Try it-you'll LOVE it!

This one was not a keeper in my family. Really Bland. The peppers were tender however I did take the advise of other reviewers and pre-cooked the peppers some. We first tried some on the grill and some in the oven. The ones on the grill did stay together however the ones in the oven the cheese cooked out. Again the taste was very "BLAND"..

I have never tried this on the grill before.  My husband and I always just wrap them and bake them on a broiler pan in the oven.  I find that cooking them in the oven makes the jalapenos very tender and they get done at the same time that the bacon gets finished.  Also, if you don't like them quite as hot, just make very sure to get not only all of the seeds out fo the jalapenos, but also, the white membrane should be completely removed to help cut out the heat.  Also, if you don't like them hot, I don't recommend stuffing them ahead of time.  I did this once and left them sit overnight in the fridge and they were way too hot for my taste.  These are the best tailgating food ever!  We call ours Cyclone Hot Poppers after our beloved Iowa State Cyclones!  Definitely YUMMY!

These are my favorites when my husband barbecues. Definatley clean out the inside of the jalapeno before putting the cream cheese in though. My husband stuffs his with flavored cream cheese but I like plain cream cheese when the peppers are hot enough. I'm also sure to get the good bacon and check for the meat to fat ratio on the slices for the perfect popper!

WE LOVE LOVE LOVE these! I definitely expanded on ingredients. I add minced garlic, shredded cheese, a few pantry seasonings and some bread crumbs to the cream cheese, then filled pepper halves with the mixture and wrapped in bacon. Baked in the oven on 425 until bacon was done and OMG!!! I have made these on many occassions and they are definitely one of the items are my guest look forward to when I'm hosting. I suggest using a nice quality bacon and NEVER use colored toothpicks. LOL

We absolutely loved these!  I didn't have quite enough bacon to use whole strips around some of the jalapeno halves, so I cut some of the strips of bacon in half.  It worked, but next time I would make sure I had enough bacon to use a whole strip per half jalapeno.  My husband told me to be sure to make these again for our next Tapas party.  
P.S.  I'm glad I used a grilling basket to hold these as they were grilling.  They would have been at risk for falling into the grill.

I've made these over a dozen times but I use GOAT cheese! So delicious! I usually make them ahead of time and then BBQ on the upper level so the bacon doesn't burn ( I use a full piece).

My husband and I made these this evening and let me say...THAT THEY ARE AMAZING!! We used ten peppers halved, seeded and most of the membranes taken out. We used two blocks of cream cheese with onion and garlic powder added. We then filled the peppers and used a whole piece of thick cut bacon. through them in the freezer for about 15 minutes and tossed them on the grill. Delicious, will make again and again!

Love these! I do not wrap bacon around them to messy and way to much work. I half cook the bacon and cut off most of the fat a lay on top of the broiled jalapeño and cream cheese then pop them under the broiler for another minute or two.

These were delicious! I seeded mine and removed the membranes but didn't soak them in water before so they would still be pretty hot. Also I didn't have a grill available so I baked them in the oven at 345 for about 50 minutes. Here's how they came out!

I LOVE these!  I use garlic herb cream cheese, add red pepper flakes, if I have havarti jalapeno cheese I will line the pepper with 1/4 slice, then the cream cheese, wrap the bacon and cook in the toaster oven. I make them at work for my co workers.

Always a crowed pleaser in our house! I add jalapeno cream cheese which adds a kick of deliciousness! When we can't grill them we add real bacon pieces on top of the jalapeno cream cheese and pop them in the oven at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. (give or take)

These were so good! I had to bake them for 30 minutes at 350. I used turkey bacon which comes cooked. I added some shredded cheese and cut some defrosted fully cooked chicken fries in half and put them on top of the cheese. The bacon I put on lengthwise to help keep the cheese from going out the top wide part. I baked them on a foil lined sheet sprayed with oil.

Yummy! I doubled the recipe but only increased cream cheese by 50%...and it was plenty of filling! As suggested, I also added ranch mix and it really spruced up the flavor. To decrease the jalapeno's heat, I blanched them in boiling water for 3 minutes...and they came out with the perfect level of heat. Baked in the oven at 400*F...voila! Would def do again!

This is a great and very popular recipe; have made this basic one for years but will have to try some of the variations suggested.  One thing I do to make the peppers cook faster (at 400 degrees) is to pre-cook the bacon until a little brown.  They also come out less greasy.  Then I fasten the bacon to the peppers.

These were great, and disappeared quickly!  Something I didnt think about until I was assembling...dont remove the tops of the peppers!  Need to leave the tops on or the cheese all runs out when it melts. Just slice the peppers lengthwise and then pull them apart at the top (the stem will stay on one side or the other).  For ease, I baked them in the oven instead of grilling... 400 degrees for about 30-45 min, until bacon was done.

We do a variation of these, I mixed the five blend shredded cheese about a cup, in with the cream cheese.  Then instead of grilling them, we put them in the smoker for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the bacon has crisped and the peppers have a burnished appearance and a smoky aroma..  we tried the smoker since we were also making smoked, stuffed bacon wrapped hamburgers.

These are awesome :) If you don't have a grill, you can just wrap these up without the toothpick (make sure it's wrapped tight) and cook them in the oven. Cover a baking dish in foil and broil the wraps for about 10-15 minutes, then bake at 400 for another 20 or so (based on how crispy you want them), flipping them over halfway through. Because of the foil on the dish, cleanup is very easy and they come out perfect and crispy.

Every time we make these, they are a big hit. We have a few friends that can't handle the heat of the jalapenos, so we started using the colorful sweet peppers as well. They are still as good as the original recipe. Outstanding for picnics, outdoor parties, or where ever/when ever the grill is heating up!

These are delicious!  The grilled bacon flavor was fantastic!!  I’ve tried several oven versions of poppers and the taste you get from the BBQ is way better!  I would recommend freezing them first as the cheese does tend to leak out.  However, I did find the filling a little bland.  For my second batch I mixed the cream cheese with cooked hot sausage meat and it really brought the poppers to life.

I have tried this recipe many times.  Great for Atkins Diet.  Instead of wrapping the bacon around the peppers I cook the bacon and crmble then once peppers are stuffed with cream cheese I press the bacon onto the cheese the bake or grill.

These were delicious! But be careful while grilling, the bacon drippings create high flames. Overall the flavor combination was good. Not as spicy as you may think. Try filling them with cheddar as well!

An absolute hit! The prep work is the hard part...getting the seeds out. I usually make these for my friends and they all prefer it on the hot side, which saves me the extra steps of boiling or soaking. Must cook until the bacon is crisp too. I put them in the freezer before grilling  for about 2 hours to give the cheese a fighting chance on the grill. This appetizer moves quicker than anything..even shrimp! .never any leftovers no matter how many I make!

Simply amazing! I prepped 24 of them for a football game tomorrow and prefroze them to ensure they would stick together and the cream cheese wouldn't melt it in the oven.. I did a trial bake with four so hubby and the boys and I could each try one... So glad I did , lined a lipped cookie sheet with foil and used a cooling rack to bake them on so they wouldn't be baking in their own grease! Baked at 350 for 35 minutes and let cool for 10 before tasting!! very good recipe and the possibilities are endless.

I make these a little different.  Mix the cream cheese with shredded Tex-Mex cheese and precooked Italian Sausage (mild is hot enough!).  I fry the sausage meat (skin off) and then drain off the grease.  Mix all together and stuff the peppers.  No need to wrap in bacon.  These are not greasy at all.  Just pop in the oven until done.  Can never make enough to satisfy my family and friends!

Do not use thick cut bacon!  It was all I had, but we LOVED this!.  Use only FRESH jalapenos!  The toothpick needs to go thru the bacon & jalapeno.

Instead of grilling the jalapenos, I baked them in a 375 degree oven for about 20 minutes (till the bacon started crisping). They were good. 

HINT: When buying the jalapeños, try to get the bigger ones. They are easier to clean and to stuff.

For best results, use small jalapenos the size of 2 bites.Absolutely freeze them for 15 mins. prior to grilling.

I really like this recipe. I do mine a little differently. I don't like to cut the peppers in half. Instead, I slit straight down one side. All it takes is one finger-swipe to deseed. I score the outside of the pepper with a fork. I have also tried filling with 1/2 string cheese 1/2 cream cheese. I'm not a good bacon wrapper either, so I kinda sew up the seam and harpoon the bacon curl with a toothpick. They're also pretty good if you 'accidentally ' swipe em with some Bbq sauce. Lol.

These are so easy and tasty.  I use a teaspoon to scoop out the seeds and veins leaving  some or not depending how hot you want them.  I also tried a bit of spin on them by using blueberry flavoured goat cheese to stuff and wrapping with procuitto.  These were even more of a hit. Do try!

My husband has made this many times. We call them poppers. As the recipe says, "seeded". ALWAYS remove the seeds from the jalapenos unless you want them extra hot! My husband has to make them because I have an extremely painful reaction on my hands (they turn bright red and burning hot; takes hours for it to go away) when handling raw jalapenos. We started using neufchatel cream cheese because not only does it have 1/3 less fat, it also doesn't melt as badly as regular cream cheese. We've never noticed ANY difference in how they taste. We also prefer them baked on a greased cookie sheet in the oven at 400-425 degrees instead of grilling them as the grill flavor tends to overpower the delicate cheese flavor. Be sure and use thin bacon and wrap it generously (of course it shrinks). They usually take about 15-20  minutes to get the bacon crispy. Just watch them carefully.

These are great if you add a medium sized (20-40 count) shrimp on top of the cream cheese before wrapping with bacon. We call them Gator eggs.

I used yellow banana peppers instead of jalapenos for a milder version.  Also wrapped them with dried beef for a lower cal option.

This is a cute idea, and these peppers make a nice presentation. The taste, however, is really bland.  (personal opinion, of course). I'll try them again with a huge difference -  I'll saute the peppers first in Bertolli Classico Olive Oil and garlic until the peppers are nicely browned and then lightly salt them. Olive Oil gives nearly everything an amazing flavor that's unmatched with anything else.  Plain cream cheese is pretty boring - it could at least be mixed with flavorful shredded cheeses. The bacon is a nice addition; however it should be thin cut so it crisps quicker. Thanks.

OMG I just tried these and found them to be sensational. I used Low-Sodium bacon which was great. Also I forgot to purchase cream cheese but remembered the traditional ones also have a cheddar version I liked. So I used Mozzarella, and Cheddar and even put a slice of Pepperoni in each to boost the flavor potential. In the infamous words of Chef Emeril..Bammm it kicked it up a notch in flavor. Also the cheddar and mozzarella melts better leaks less than cream cheese. Remember to wear gloves when seeding them, and be sure your Bacon is wrapped tightly around each one. Best done on a charcoal grill. Burgers and Cole Slaw were a nice accompaniment

These are awesome!  I used cream cheese with chives, topped with shredded taco cheese and finely chopped onions, baked in oven (too cold outside to grill!) 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  You will love these!!

My GOD these are good!  I mixed in some Cajun seasoning to the cream cheese then wrapped them with a slice of bacon and put them in the fridge for a few hours so the cheese would harden.  End results were fantastic!

These were absolutely the BEST thing I've ever done in the way of appetizers!  So EASY!  So YUMMY!  So AMAZING!  Too bad I can't give it more stars . . . A couple of things, however: Wrap bacon over and around jalapeños in such a way that the cream cheese can't run out the end during grilling, and always remember to completely remove seeds and membranes if you DON'T want them overly hot.  WTG, Miss G.  These absolutely MADE our dinner party! :)

So easy to make - people will be amazed you slaved away making them. Plus jalapenos are super inexpensive! You don't have to do anything special to them to take away the heat other than to make sure to take out the all of the seeds and all the membrane (scoop it out flush inside). Also if you're going to grill it - don't use the flimsy toothpicks because they'll just burn and then you're left carefully chewing look for the piece of stick left behind. I've baked them (on a foil lined pan) and they came out yummy too.

First blanch some/all of the peppers to reduce the heat before stuffing.Recommend experimenting the stuffing with variety of cheeses, not just cream cheese. Use a whole piece of bacon. After you put the pepper together with cheese, bacon and toothpick - freeze it for 15 min, then 10 minutes on the grill.

They have not finished cooking yet. I am cooking them on 3:60 checking them every once and a while.
I think that they will taste better if i let the bacon stay sort of chewy, but cooked. that way you can still taste the bacon, not the char. But they were very easy to make! (thats why I gave it 5 stars) and it uses a small list of ingredients.  All of the other recipies called for at least 10 things. but this only needs 3! Money saver. I am going to eat these as a snack since it is movie night with my dad and little brother. (i am 13, thats why i live with my dad, and my mom is out of town on business. thats why i did not mention her.) so yeah, great though, and they smelled good even though they are raw!

These are always on my grill at one of our bbq gatherings. I have been pretty creative at times adding 1 cooked  grilled shrimp or fresh herbs, parmesan cheese, bacon bits, green onions to the cream cheese mixture, etc. The possibilities are endless and of course great just the way they are.

These peppers are always a hit at my cookouts. (and are always the first gone) I usually have folks waiting by the grill to grab them!
I use variations from time to time by adding shrimp, cooked sausage, or whatever strikes my fancy at that time.
A helpful tip: When grilling larger amounts (20-60 or more) I use metal skewers (w/ handles) instead of toothpicks. I usually add 5-6 peppers per skewer. Makes them easier to cook and safer for guests that might be unaware of the toothpick! (as they can burn down on the ends and be concealed within the pepper.)

I saved this recipe a couple of weeks ago and then had a BBQ over the house. I made about 40 of these with some fresh Jalapeño peppers from the fruit stand. Big Peppers 5-6 inches long lol saved the seeds. Put cream cheese in the hafted peppers and wrapped with bacon used tooth picks like mentioned in the recipe good idea. Half I left alone just like the recipe. The other half I put some Tony’s Cajun season on the cream cheese before the bacon just a little. After the bacon was wrapped and picked I had just purchased some NEW “Tabasco Buffalo style hot sauce” and was dying to try this on something. So I drizzled it on the top after the top of the peppers bacon was cooked flipped it to cook the bottom. Have to say pretty  good. Another jalapeno recipe that I will make again this is another good one.

We've been doing these now for years! We like to add browned sausage and a little cheddar cheese to our cream cheese mixture. It is AMAZING, so much that it is one my 8yr olds favorites! 
For those that may not be cream cheese fans or looking for something healthier we will make small strips of chicken that would fit in the Jalapenos and marinate them in Teriyaki sauce. Then place the chicken strips in the Jalapenos and wrap with bacon. This has also been a hit at parties.

This was a super yummy meal.  We made this tonight in the oven with the cream cheese mixed with ranch dressing mix.  We cooked it in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes and broiled it for 2 minutes than left them out to cool down.  It was a fantastic meal item.

my family has made these for years.. however we ALWAYS season the cream cheese filling.  I use minced garlic & fresh cilantro, but the cajun version suggested sounds good too.  I like them best on the grill, but there are "popper racks" you can buy for the oven, no soaking in bacon grease that way!

We just cut off the stem end and scoop out whatever seeds and pith we can get. That's the hot part of the pepper. Want them mild, cut in half like it says and they come out like bell peppers.
Enjoy.

For the buffalo wing lovers - we make these by taking a rotisserie chicken, shred it up and add buffalo wing sauce and mix with the cream cheese. Then stuff in the peppers, wrap with bacon and grill. They are Amazing! And you can make way more than a dozen!

Double the jalapenos and cream cheese (and bacon obviously), add 1lb COOKED ground sausage (maple or hot Italian) to the cream cheese and this is a WINNER!
Preheat oven to 375 and cook uncovered 1hr.
!!!!WEAR GLOVES WHEN SHELLING JALAPENOS!!!!! "Hunan Hand" was horrible!

Instead of cream cheese which can be tasteless and runny, I use a solid sharp cheddar or jack cheese which I slice and cut and insert into the jalapeno. It holds up and tastes so much better!

Recipe is good as a starting point.  I followed another readers suggestion and added granulated garlic,salt, pepper and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce.  Its a good idea to freeze for about 15-30 min then put in the fridge till your ready to cook.  Didnt grill, I just put the oven on 375 for about an hour.  Everyone loves these!

My sister makes these for any summer get together and everyone LOVES them!  We use turkey bacon to make them a little healthier and I think it actually tastes better because you don't have all that chewy fat on the bacon.  Highly recommend trying!

I make these with stuffed whole jalapenos.  So how do you keep the cheese from melting into the grill with the halves? Thanks.

Ok this is simple. I bought different kinds of cream cheese, a garlic and herb one, and onion and chive and a sante fe blend. I preferred the onion and chive blend. And I made plain cream cheese ones. Oh, I got smoked salmon, much better for this than regular bacon.

Excellent snack!! I have cooked them in the oven and on the grill. They are best when cooked on a well seasoned grill by far. I recommend any pepper lover to try them.

Very tasty and popular at a party I took them to.  I tried grilling as directed, and I also tried smoking with some hickory wood in my smoker for about 1 1/2 hours.  I thought both were great but liked the smoked version.

Very easy and very good!  We mixed Worcestershire and garlic powder into the cream cheese mix.  We have cooked them in the oven and on the grill; there is a fat pooling/dripping factor either way.  Also, the cream cheese mix bubbles out, even after I chilled them in the fridge overnight or in the freezer for 30 minutes.  However, neither of those issues will keep me from making these again.  They were delicious!

AMAZING!  To cut down on the fat I used low fat cream cheese and turkey bacon.  You can control the heat of the jalapenos easily by scrapping out the seeds and white membrane.

This was really good.  It's a pain to stuff and wrap each pepper though. I put the peppers in a foil baking dish, covered with cream cheese and topped with bacon bits..  I put them on the grill for 15-20 minutes.  Everyone loved them.

YUM!!  My peppers this year have been producing like crazy and I thankfully stumbled on this recipe before they were done.  Made about 30 of these one night, froze them singly on a cookie sheet and then tossed them in a gallon freezer bag until ready to grill.  Grilled them a few nights later with friends over and they were a HUGE hit among everyone!  Will never settle for breaded/fried poppers again after tasting these gems!!  Only tip:  I speared each popper with a toothpick to make sure the bacon stayed on.  No changes!

These are the bomb!  We make these at home all the time with the fresh peppers we grow.  We also take the cream cheese and add different spices to it to give it a different flavor.

jalapeños are supposed to be hot! my sisters and i eat them as a relish, with tears rolling down our cheeks! great way to unstop sinuses! LOL... this recipe is right there next to the Jalapeño Cornbread for party food... parboiling will help reduce the bite.. but we like them hot... great recipe and easy to do.

These are very basic. I have been making another version for years.  Brown a cup of ground italian sausage, and a half cup of grated cheese, I usually use cheddar cheese.  Add to the cream cheese. Then wrap with bacon. Yummy!

Made these yesterday..got great review from everyone.  I used a whole slice of bacon, tried with 1/2 and it didn't go around the pepper (and they were not big peppers) I cooked them in the oven 40 minutes at 350.  I turned them over at the end of 40 minutes and broiled for about 5-8 minutes so the other side of the bacon was cooked.  I had some nice pepper jelly as a side dish to dip them in...was a great addition.  Followed some of the other suggestions, used cream cheese with chives, packet of Ranch Dressing and some shredded cheddar cheese. Soaked the peppers in cold water for about 2 hours. After stuffing them put in freezer for about 2 hours. Love them!!!

I can think of a lot of different plays on this recipe.  Delicious plain or with anything you choose to add.  Two nights after I made them my husband volunteered to go to the store and get cream cheese so I could make them again.  Loved by everyone.

These were amazing.  Im a big fan of onion, so i chopped up a green onion and mixed in with the cream cheese before stuffing the peppers the second time I made these and my family asked for more!

I added a pack of ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese. With that addition this is 5 stars. Used other suggestions of picking LARGE peppers so the heat was milder (worked) and soaking in a bit of cold water after de-seeding/de-veining...

I Loved the idea of this recipe. But my jalapenos were SOO spicy that they were inedible! :( We love spicy food but our mouths were burning! It was a shame to have them sitting in front of us looking delicious but unable to eat them! Next time I will need to soak them in water before anything! Hopefully I get the nerve to try again. Also putting the stuffed jalapenos in the freezer for 15 minutes before, as others suggested, helped a TON on the grill.

I personally bake these...it prevents from having to battle the grill fire due to the bacon fat...you bake them until bacon gets crispy

So good! Great dinner party appetizer because you can have them prepared ahead of time. I assembled the morning of our party and put in freezer until about 30 min before cooking I moved to the fridge. The cheese then didn't melt all over. In my opinion the cream cheese should not be left plain; be creative and add different seasonings. I added a chipotle seasoning to mine and was delicious.

Awesome!  I don't have a grill so I made these in the oven in my grill pan.  Oven temp at 350 till the bacon was crispy.  I turned mine once so all sides would be nice and crispy.  Not too much of a mess really.  When I asked my boyfriend what he thought...he said he could not stop eating them!  I got one!  Will make again!

wanna change it up a little?  add a date, cut in half on top of the cream cheese..wrap your bacon on it and then...smoke it..yummmmmmy. You can also microwave the bacon till half done and still flexible, then wrap..saves grease catching on fire on the bbq

I have not made it with plain cream cheese, but I cook a lb of breakfast sausage and mix with cream cheese before stuffing peppers and wrap them.  Cook at 300 for 45 minutes, less if you want more heat.  I have also put them on smoker for about an hour at 250.  They are awesome.

this really is a keeper. To the cream cheese add chopped scallion then baste with BBQ sauce after you wrap in bacon. Cook 30 min at 225 then 30 min at 400 on cookie sheet (on metal rack to preserve crispiness if you have one)

These are a must have at our house, however we add Shrimp before the bacon to add that extra kick to it!  I highly recommend the addition.

!st time I made these I followed the recipe, and thought that they were really good. Could be the size of my peppers (I thought that they were large), but I had plenty of filling left, enough for 12 peppers. What I added to the cream cheese: seeds and membrane (minced) from 3 peppers, some habanero cheese, pkg of Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning. I get thin sliced bacon and I halve it length wise. Always a big hit with everyone, but the gerber mouths. I also use a veggie tray on the grill.

We thought these were going to be too hot but it really depended on the peppers as each have there own heat level. 
I did add some chedder mix to the cream cheese mixture and some garlic pepper.
A little time consuming to seed the peppers. I did wear gloves and glad I did!
Overall very tasty and will be a repeat in our house.

I have also made this recipe with brats squeezed out of the casing, seasoned with a spicy seasoning (we like Rhino seasoning...a locally made seasoning from the Rine brothers...not sure if they offer it on the web), then stuffed inside the pepper before wrapping with bacon as my husband hates cream cheese. Grilling them takes most of the heat out if you've removed the seeds and membrane....oh my! It makes me hungry for these as I type!

My daughter has been making these for about a year, perfected the technique.... use light cream cheese, it does not melt much and saves a few calories. we don't like them precooked, keep them a little crisp to the bite. Use regular bacon, not thick sliced, a whole slice and try to leave the end on the bottom so it stays wrapped.
Put them on an upper shelf of a hot grill and put a pan under to catch the grease!!! saves using the water bottle to put out fires!
and make more than you think you;ll need - they will disappear!

My husband loved these.  I don't eat meat so I didn't put the bacon on mine and it seemed like it was missing something.  I think next time I will mix the cream cheese with wing sauce and see how that works.

Yummy good.  My family love poppers, but these are so easy and forget the breading!  Did them in the broiler, due to pouring rain, but scrumptious just the same.

The 1st time I made these about a month ago, I added a little ranch dressing seasoning mix to the cream cheese.  I made the mistake of reading a review that suggested I cut the bacon in half before wrapping the jalepenos.  This probably would have been ok except I bought the jalapenos at the local Farmer's market and they were huge.  I couldn't get half a slice of bacon all the way around so pinning it to the jalapeno was difficult.  They kind of fell apart on the grill.  They were still DI-LICIOUS so they still get 5 stars.
The 2nd time I made them for visiting family, it started pouring rain so I had to bake them in the oven.  It took way too long (for a hungry crowd) and the bacon made a big greasy mess.  HOWEVER, they still disappeared in seconds and people were asking for more.  They must not have been too bad. :)

We have made these several times.  Instead of grilling, we bake them at 400 about 20 minutes and then put them under the broiler until the bacon is crisp, just a few minutes.  They are wonderful.

These are always gone 1st at parties!
I make them several different ways.
1.stuffed with pulled pork & sharp cheddar cheese.- 
2. stuffed with Italian sausage, cream cheese & fresh grated parm cheese.
3. Buffalo Chickenshredded chicken with Franks Red Hot & Blue Cheese.
4. Chrizio (Mexican Sausage) and Queso Cheese
5. Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Pepper Jack & Cilantro
The posibilities are endless! 

I also make these by cutting the top off, cleaning out the insides, stuffing, putting the top back on, put a wooden skewer from bottom to top, wrap with bacon by starting at bottom of pepper working toward the top and place end of bacon over the tip of the skewer, then grill! Yummy!
Enjoy

My husband and I make these all the time, except we don't wrap in bacon we just put small slices on top so you don't end up with any mushy bacon on the bottom.  We also sprinkle with a little brown sugar before cooking.  Great with banana peppers too!

VERY GOOD. I FIND THE CREAM CHEESE KIND OF HARD TO WORK WITH. I ALWAYS USE STRING CHEESE. I TAKE ONE AND CUT IN HALF, STUFF A HALVED JALAPENO AND WRAP IN BACON. YOU CAN GRILL OR BAKE. THEY ARE SOOOOOO GOOD AND WAY EASY. I THROUGH THEM TOGETHER FOR A SNACK. WE ALSO USE THE SKIM MILK STRING CHEESE.

This is a great recipe, you do need a whole piece of bacon for the wrap.  I used whipped cream cheese, added some sharp shredded cheese and about a tablespoon of liquid smoke, delish!!!!!!

I use a small melon baller to remove the innards of the pepper. Works like a charm and doesn't destroy the pepper in the process. To stuff the peppers try using a cake decorating tool. Use a large tip since the filling is thicker than icing.  Easy and fun for the kids who want to help. Be sure they are wearing gloves, though.

I couldn't believe the turnout on these for our Father's Day cookout! They came out AMAZING! However, after reading many other reviews about the bacon catching fire due to the fat, I tried the precooked bacon...came out PERFECT! They cook up faster, no grease fire and they would also work for baking in the oven because they won't get soaked in grease...I'm not big on the seasonings that were suggested but I did use fat free cream cheese, low fat cheddar (mixed together), and the pre-cooked bacon was lower cals than reg bacon. EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT!!!!

You can have these any time of the year! They can be baked in the oven to enjoy on those winter days as well!  Bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes- if bacon needs to be a bit more crispy run under the broiler a minute.  I have also stuffed the  cream cheese filled jalapeno with a 'lil smokie' cocktail weinie as well. It helps to stabilize them and make them not as explosive and messy when you bite into one!

These were really good. I cut a slit down the side of each pepper and used the back of a fork to scrap out the seeds. As another suggested, I boiled the peppers for a few minutes to make them more tender. Since I left the peppers whole with just a slit in the side the cheese stayed put nicely when grilling. I do recommend freezing the stuffed peppers for 10 minutes before throwing on the grill.  And they're hot! Yum!

These are awesome!  I recommend them to friends all the time.  I've done them on the grill and in the oven, either method works well.

These were good, and all were eaten at the New Years Eve party. I followed a couple of other reviewer recommendations - boiled the peppers 4-6 min to take heat out and to get them to cook without burning the bacon, I also mixed the cream cheese with a ranch packet, and I baked them at 425* for 25 min.   Next time I make them I will add a different seasoning to the cream cheese. The ranch just did not pack enough flavor.   Only 4 stars because of all the adjustments.

I tried it with a variety of cream cheese flavors.  They all were delicious.  Make sure you wear gloves when you prepare the jalepenos.  I took them to a party and everyone loved them.

I love these. I recommend using regular cut bacon, not thick cut. The thick cut took too long to cook.  ONE WORD OF ADVICE: GRILL CREAM CHEESE SIDE DOWN FIRST, THEN FLIP.  THAT HELPS KEEP THE CREAM CHEESE FROM MELTING OUT.

Very tasty!! Made 3 rounds on our camping trip this weekend and they were a hit. I found pan frying or cooking in the oven works better than on the grill. Much easier to move around and keep the cream cheese inside. The other tweaks were adding 1/2 cup sharp cheddar, worchestershire sauce and garlic to the cream cheese. AWESOME RECIPE!!!

We made these for a BBQ and they were loved by everyone.  We used 2 packages of cream cheese and 1 package of dry ranch mix. Mmmmm very good.  We made a bunch of them to freeze.  Instead of cutting them in half we just cut the top off and removed all the seed and membrane.  If you have never messed with jalepanos before be careful they will burn your hands.  I did not know this and ended up with severe burns so don't forget your gloves !!

used chive cream cheese and turkey bacon, froze before grilling...used jalapenos out of my garden and wish they had been a touch hotter, but this was a great snack/appetizer! And I was wondering what to do with all those peppers....

These are known to most meat smokers as "ABT's." Cut off the tops of the peppers and remove the ribs and seeds, a pepper corer helps with this. For the filling I use chive & onion cream cheese and mix in a handful of shredded cheddar and a fair amount of my favorite BBQ rub. I use a "Jerky Shooter" to fill the peppers almost to the top and wrap them in a full slice of bacon secured with a toothpick. Thinner bacon works best. On the smoker at about 250°F burning hickory. Takes about 1 1/2-2 hours, just until the bacon is done. A lot of the heat disappears, but not all! You will get an occasional surprise. These are killer with "Something cool to drink", COLD beer I'd say.

Beware! These are so addictive! I usually double this recipe and add shredded cheddar cheese and minced garlic to the cream cheese (I never measure so I don't know how much). To ease cleaning of the peppers, I cut them in half and use a small spoon to scrape out the seeds and most of the membrane. I also grill them on a pan to keep the bacon from charring.

I have made PW's bacon jalapeno thingies forever but tried these on the grill today - Wow - absolutely incredible.  I could eat these things non stop for days.  Excellent and great idea doing them on the grill Melissa - adds a new dimension of flavor.  Thanks!

I liked these okay.  Everyone else loved them.  I did boil for about 4 minutes before stuffing them.  I also added half a package of ranch mix.  I also used a whole piece of bacon because I thought half was too small.  The only problem I had was some of the cheese mix coming out as they cooked (in the oven).

So good!  I'm not into spicy food so I soaked the peppers in ice water for 30 minutes before I stuffed and grilled them.  They were awesome!  Literally disappeared in seconds at the Block Party.  Will definitely make again!

These are really good, however, like one reader suggested we always put Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper in the cream cheese(we like em spicy)  I've also tried them with red bell pepper in the cream cheese.  You can kind of make them your own and add whatever you like to the cream cheese to flavor it up.  MAKE SURE TO WEAR GLOVES WHILE HANDLING THE JALAPENOS!!!  Especially if you wear contact lenses!

These are always requested by my friends. However, I do make some changes to the recipe. I use whole jalapenos instead of halved ones. I cut a piece of jalapeno out, fill the bottom with shredded cheddar cheese, then fill w/cream cheese, then wrap w/bacon. Slow cook on the grill for about 45 minutes and they are no longer too hot. Cook over direct heat for 20 minutes for hotter jalapenos.

OMG, these were the best we've ever made! I followed the advice of a user and boiled the peppers after cleaning them for 4 mins, then soaked them in cold water another 3-4 mins before making and grilling and they were PERFECT, even the kids ate them!

We make these anytime we have a get together and they're always a hit!  Definitely wear gloves while preparing the peppers!  Also, we have discovered that if you use a broiler pan it gives the grease somewhere to go.  Finally, if you bake them at a lower temp for longer it'll make them less powerful.  I try to do 325 for about an hour and they are the perfect temp for me.

Although I have made these probably fifty times, I'm just getting around to reviewing them. I have made them as written and also made them adding dry ranch dressing mix and shredded cheddar to the cream cheese. They are delicious either way. They are a favorite at our house!

Very good,  all made were eaten.  Trick is to keep the cream cheese from leaking out an getting the bacon cooked sufficiently.  I let them sit wrapped in the fridg over night. I grilled them on a hot grill upside down until bacon browns. then turn over to help keep filling in.  After the other side browns, I then put them in the oven under the broiler (on low) for about 10 minutes.  They stay warm in a glass baking dish for about an hour.

YummY!  I blanched them in boiling water for a few minutes, drained on paper towels before filling them.
I also used turkey bacon.  the last few minutes of cooking time I turned the broiler on to crisp up the bacon.

Anything wrapped in bacon is good. Jalapenos wrapped in bacon are great!

Love this recipe. I opted for the oven over the grill but it turned out delicious anyway!

We LOVED these, way more than I expected, actually! I made sure to get all the membranes/seeds out, because we really don't like super hot stuff, and they were perfect. I can't believe three simple ingredients could taste so good!  I took a previous reviewer's idea and baked them at 425 for 20 minutes, then broiled them for a few minutes to crisp the bacon. I can't wait to make them again!

We really liked these a lot!  I added crumbled blue cheese to the cream cheese, which worked out really well!  The only problem is that fatty bacon on a flame grill doesn't work too well together.  You have to watch it like a hawk or they will be burned to a crisp!  We will definitely make these again!

Took these to a party and got great reviews. I used half cream cheese and half grated sharp chedder and added about a tsp of Emeril's Southwest Seasoning.  I baked in the oven at 350 for about 25 minutes and then under the broiler until the bacon crisped up. half a piece of bacon worked great, but if you had really big peppers you might need a whole piece. This is a keeper.

I have tried these they were wonderful. If you don't like the heat, try making them with sweet banana peppers.

I made this last night because I had some fresh jalapenos from the garden and my husband was wondering what I was going to do with them.  I used dry ranch mix in the cream cheese filling and they quickly disappeared and my faily said they were "A definite do over again."  I am sure my husband will double the amount of jalapeno plants in the garden next year.

I liked this recipe.  It was easy and tasty.  I did not change a thing, but I did put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before putting them on the grill.  I did not think they were spicey, but I took all the ribs and seeds out of the pepper.  I didn't bother with securing them with tooth picks and I didn't have any issues with leakage or unwrapping, but I tucked the bacon in as I was wrapping.  I also was able to do these a day ahead which is a bonus in my book.  Thanks for sharing this recipe I will be making this again.

These were really tasty! You need to watch them carefully on the grill and turn them often. I used Oscar Meyer center cut bacon and only used about 3/4 of a slice on each jalapeno. I put them in the refridgerator for about an hour before putting on the grill. I didn't have any problems with the cheese leaking. I didn't need to use toothpicks and just stretched the bacon and tucked it in. I might try adding some shredded cheese or garlic powder mixed in next time.

These were very good, quite spicy, maybe I didn't get enough of the membranes out, but my husband loved it!  I did use whipped cream cheese just because it was easier to scoop into the peppers.  And I used center cut bacon, so a little less fat.  Will be making again soon, but next time I'll be wearing gloves to work with the peppers, my hands were on fire for several hours!!

These are so amazingly delicious! You'd better make a lot because they disappear fast. The smoky grilled flavor, heat of the pepper, and cooling effect of the cream cheese all goes together perfectly. These are my favorite grilled item ever! My husband LOVED these too. Hint: Wear gloves when preparing a lot, otherwise the oils from the peppers can irritate your skin and "burn" your hands. I didn't have any problem making 6 pepper's worth, but when making 26 peppers, my hands were on fire by the end. We made over 50 of these for July 4th and there were none left!

We used a small cube of cheddar cheese secured with cream cheese, then wrapped in bacon.  Absolutely delicious!  I did take the advice to blanch the raw jalapenos to soften them up and I think it cut the bite a good bit.  Wonderful with a side of ranch dressing!

I make these but using grated sharp cheddar cheese and fresh shrimp.  Great on gas or charcoal grill.  We buy about 40 jalepenos to 1lb of shrimp to ensure everyone gets more than one.  Quality ingredients especially bacon is the key.

I love this recipe!  I usually cream the cream cheese with beaters to make it easier to spread.  I also add a couple of dollops of whole-fat mayo for extra flavor.  I have tried flavored cream cheeses, too.  I use pickeled jalapenos; the ones in the can.  I also cut my bacon into halves to wrap around the stuffed jalapenos.  I bake mine in the oven at 450 for about 20 minutes or so.  The cream cheese puffs up and the bacon is crispy and they are addictive!  I make this for every party and they are always the first things gone.  I am asked for the recipe more times than I can count.  Try them!

I made about 135 of these for a party last summer.  It was tedious and time-consuming...but they were great.  Not ONE left on the platter.  I grilled them all.  Used very lean bacon to avoid flare-ups.  Will do again!

I have made these before and a suggestion I would make is to drizzle some syrup over top of the jalapenos before you put them into the oven.  It gives great balance to the hot of the pepper and makes the bacon taste like maple cured bacon.

Great recipe.  I modified it for use in the oven and added 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 sharp cheddar.  The first time I made it, I cooked at 375 for 45 minutes and the second time I tried 350 for 50 minutes.  These turned out much better at 375 for 45 minutes.

I fry mine on the stove, and the bacon tightens up nicely & holds everything together.

These are a great appetizer!  My mother in law makes these often and I started to also!  They are always requested at family gatherings.  We usually bake ours in the oven at 375 degrees for 30-45 minutes or until the bacon is done.

SOOO Good!  Sliced in half, stuffed with cream cheese and wrapped two halves with bacon so that each one was whole, that way the cream cheese doesn't melt out and bacon gets done all the way. Serve with Raspberry chipotle sauce.

Wonderful!! Excellent appetizer.  My husband gave them a 10.  And he usually doesn't like  "hot" foods.  My tip would be to cook on foil, on medium low heat for about 10-15 minutes, and let stand at room temp for about 5-10 minutes.  We thought that it enhanced the flavor.  Will absolutely make again.

I felt these were pretty easy to throw together, I found it helpful to rinse out the jalapeno after scooping out the seeds, just to make sure any that I missed got washed out.  Our BBQ got rained out so I baked them in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes and they were very yummy.

There is no way you can cook these on high for 10 minutes. I did this yesterday and turned up charred pieces of dust. Fortunatley my second batch still had to go on so I placed tin foil down, turned it to medium and watched them like a hawk. They were delicious and I will make them again and again!!!

A real crowd pleaser!    I think you can do with less than 8tbsp of cream cheese if you fill each jalap only flush to the top... real fun to grill as they flame up!

I boiled the jalapenos for a few minutes and added a little chili powder, garlic powder and mayo to the filling.  Cooked in the oven.  Yes, some filling did spill out but most of it remained in the peppers.  Surprisingly they were not spicy at all but had a mild jalapeno flavour.  VERY labour intensive but quite tasty.

These were tasty, I played with the recipe, first of all, after seeding the jalepeno's I threw them in boiling water for a few minutes to make them easy to work with.  I also combined cheddar with the cream cheese, and added some garlic salt and pepper.  I zapped the bacon in the microwave to get some of the grease out, and partially cook.  I had a little difficulty wrapping, so I ended up spreading the cheese, folding the peppers in half, wrapping the bacon, and securing with a toothpick.  Baked them at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes then broiled till crispy.  Next time I make them I'm going to leave the membranes in the peppers, cause there was NO heat.  Also want to try pepper jack in it.  All in all a great base recipe for lots of good ideas!!

I, as well made a few small changes to this recipe.I seasoned & cooked pieces of boneless/skinless chicken breast & added that to the top of the cream cheese & pepper,wrapped in 1/2 piece of bacon. I then baked at 350 on a broiler pan for 20 minutes.The bacon was done and the cheese did not ooze out. I'm always looking for new things to take to pot luck days at work. This was a big hit.

These were delicious and soo easy! I had other things in the oven so I  baked these with the rest of them at 
350 until crisp - the cheese ooozed out a little but who cares. I think if I do it again this way, I will partially cook the bacon first so it will crisp faster and the jalapeno wont be so soggy but it was still wonderful

I made these July 6th for a party and had 5 people ask me to make them again for a party this month.  I added 1T of cajun seasoning and 1t garlic powder as someone suggested.  I'm having trouble getting my bacon crisp, so I'm going to pre cook it some this time.  This is a great recipe.

Made these the day before we went camping, but left the bacon off until ready to cook. I added some ranch seasoning to the cream cheese and they came out great!

This recipe is great for an appetizer when entertaining guests or for a snack. I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top of the cream cheese and used turkey bacon (cut in half)for each pepper. If you want to make it spicy leave the seeds in.

Had these for the first time a couple weeks ago.  I was surprised how good they are, and easy to make.  I got a HOT one the first time, but the next several I wolfed down were great!  I am not a hot spicy person, but these were mild regarding "heat".  5 star all the way!

We love this one.  To save a little time I frequently stuff the peppers with cream cheese then just lie a piece of bacon on the top then bake in the oven.  They are SOOOOO good.

We made this and added 1/2cup of cheddar cheese to the cream cheese. When the jalapenos come out of the oven try drizzling with brown sugar and butter mixture. Probably about 1/4c brown sugar to 3tbl of melted butter! THE BEST!!!

Give these a try with no fear!  They’re not hot! It’s incredible to me how a little bit of minced jalapeno in a dish can make you feel like your throat is on fire, yet you can sink your teeth into these and they are mild - yes, MILD.  These take just minutes to prepare and only a few more on the grill and there is tremendous pay-off for this minimal effort.  Delicious appetizers in no time!  I did, however, prefer to give them a couple of extra minutes under the broiler once off the grill to brown them up real well.  Flavorful, pretty, and did I say MILD?  Even Hubs with his sensitive innards enjoyed these!  And let’s not forget that they’re wrapped in bacon – now who can resist THAT?  (Note: To prevent the bacon from starting a grease fire, Hubs grilled these in a foil pan topped with a cooling rack.  It worked so well he said he wouldn’t do it any other way)

This recipe is awesome. I cook them on my Weber indirect at about 325 for about 45 minutes. Bacon is perfectly crisp & tender, the peppers are softened up & sweet. This is a must do if you do any grilling, will be the most popular appetizer at the party.

This is a great grilling appetizer. It's way easier to use whole jalapeños by cutting an incision on one side, leaving the tops on, and then use your paring knife to slice the rinds and seeds out. Them stuff and it won't come out, you can cook the bacon to a crisp which makes them even better!

Have made these several times.  Each time I make them I change a few things.  I par-bake the bacon in the oven, and I roast the jalapenos a little bit under the broiler.  I'm also adding some grated parmesan and sharp cheddar to the cream cheese.  I'm too lazy to set up the grill so I bake these in the oven at 400 until the bacon looks crispy.  I liked the recipe as is but you can really make it your own.

I make these fairly often. I add 1/4 cup shredded cheese and 1/4 cup scallions in the cheese mix and put them in the peppers and use one whole strip of bacon and wrap the jalapenos so the cheese doesn't flow out so easy and then SMOKE them at 200 deg. for 3-4 hours. Awesome!!! Might have to try a little cajun seasoning next time.

Yes, these little treats are great, we make them all the time here in Louisiana and we call them armadillo eggs.
Thanks for sharing this with all other pepper lovers.

DON'T FORGET THE GLOVES!!!!!!! Especially when making a lot, the first time I made them we needed about 3 dozen, ouch. For less heat be sure to scrape all the ribs and seeds out. I make them in the oven, and top about half with a slice of sharp cheddar wen they come out.

This is always a win for any potlucks or get togethers. People just love bacon. As for cooking. I tested them out the day before, without chilling them in the frige, and all the cheese melted. Once i put them all together, chilled them over night, and cheese held fine on the grill the next day. i also added cajon seasoning on top of the whipped cream cheese before i rolled on the bacon. Placed them cheese side down on the grill. Next time i try these finger foods, i will add different kinds of cheeses to see how it works.

Cleaning these to get the veins and seeds out is essential to them not being too hot, but it's a chore and the gases will get you!  We do it in a bowl of cold water with gloves on.  We also use a brick of cream cheese and cut it into the right size to push into the jalapeno.  I would also add some sort of alcoholic beverage for sharing, because this is a group effort.  Delicious recipe you can't make enough of.

I really like this recipe, made them for New Years and plan on making them again for the super bowl. The only thing I do different is I add some of the seeds from the peppers in the cream cheese. I like the heat from the peppers and this definitely gives the poppers some heat. The only difference I will try this time is I will precook the bacon a little so as to take some of the grease out of the poppers.

My sister makes these for every family get together. We LOVE them!! This recipe is actually how I found your site.. I asked where she got the recipe.. They are tasty, and I am sure the peppers add a bit of a "healthy" kick. She and I make them exactly as the recipe states. They are fantastic!

This is a SOLID 5 star appetizer!!!  Very simple ingredients, yet very time consuming to make...I agree, absolutely make these ahead of time!!!  I can't stress enough the importance of cleaning jalapenos out THOROUGHLY...unless you don't mind your mouth on fire!! I usually cut bacon slices in half and it's still plenty of bacon flavor:)

Just made these and they turned out terrific!  Baked them at 400 degrees for 25 min. and they were perfect.  Used another person's idea of keeping the jalapeno whole with the top on and just using a t-cut to take out seeds.  Also used my husbands jalapeno caribou bacon and it was so tasty!  I would also recommend boiling them for a few minutes before stuffing to start them out a little tender so they are done all the way.  Great recipe!

I baked them in the oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. They were really good. I added chives to the cream cheese, and still felt like they were missing something. I read on a different recipe to add dry ranch to the cream cheese. Might try that next time.. Overall, really good and fairly simple to make.

I have made these b-4 but as far as the next day, the bacon is soft & soggy. Myself, I like it crisp like the day you make it. Other than that they are great, even if you add a little more spices.

I make this all the time. Make it the same way as called for, EXCEPT, I dip them in Barbque sauce (whatever  brand your choice is). I then either place them on grill for about 10-15 mins or I bake them in the oven on 400 for 15-20 mins. Watch the bacon. If not crispy bake until it is. Taste so much better with the barbque sauce.

These are so good and so easy to make....my boyfriend asks for them almost every time we are grilling or football is on!  I cut and de-seed the jalapenos, fill them with cream cheese and used a whole piece of thick sliced bacon to wrap around the jalepeno and just tucked the end piece under the bacon.  Be sure to put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before you grill them and grill them cream cheese side down first.  Also be sure to keep on eye on the grill, sometimes the grease from the bacon will drip onto the charcoal and start a little fire flare up.

This is our favorite side to any dish! We love it so much that we were going out in the snow to use our grill in the middle of the winter! I tried these in the oven and because of the bacon grease it just made too much of a mess that we battle the weather for the grill!!

I followed the suggestions of adding a packet of ranch and putting them in the freezer for 15 minutes prior to grilling. They were a HUGE hit! When my daughter saw me making them, she told me she wouldn't eat any because she didn't like them, because she didn't like cream cheese. She LOVED these! They were beyond great!!

be careful with the jalapenos. They were way too spicy when I made this and made them not edible.  Couldn't even taste the bacon or cream cheese because the spiciness was so overpowering.  If the peppers were a bit more mild this would have been great.

I really wanted to love these but the peppers were still way too raw. I'm not giving up. Next time I'll try thick sliced bacon. If that doesn't work, maybe I'll try baking them stuffed with the cheese and topped with crumbled bacon as suggested by others.

delicious, i use fresh jalapenos and they arent the slightest bit spicy. normally i refuse to touch jalapenos, but i make sure I get one or 2 of these! Haven't figured out how to get bacon crispy enough yet. I place toothpick-speared peppers on a round pizza pan with holes upside down over another pizza pan to catch the grease that drips thru the holes. I place on bottom rack until bacon looks fairly crispy underneath, then move to top rack and broil for a few mins, but still can't quite get it crispy enough, it's still a little too chewy. I have tried turning up the heat but that just makes the grease caught in the pan smoke, and smoke up the house when I open the oven to check on it. Max I can do is 375-400 for no smoke. Suggestions???

Tried and true.  We have used chive cream cheese, fat free cream cheese and now will try the dry ranch mixed into fat free cream cheese.  I get a pkg of sandwich sliced ham and wrap the poppers in that now instea dof the bacon....MUCH easier and nothing but rave reviews.  ALso, we do parboil them, to take some of the heat out.  Made again and again in our home....

Yummy!! I used herb and garlic cream cheese as well as shredded cheddar which I mixed together before filling the peppers. I baked them on a foil lined cookie sheet with on top of a rack sprayed with pam. I cooked them for about an hour at 350. Make sure to only fill the peppers 3/4 full or the cheese will bubble over :)

I've made these SEVERAL times, and was surprise to find them here under a different name. The Big Green Egg community has been making these for many years, under the name ABT's.... Atomic Buffalo Turds! Kids LOVE 'em! LOL
The I will say that after you stuff them with cream cheese, you can do MANY things with them, but the most simple... I sprinkle with my favorite rub (or whatever spices you like, before you wrap them with bacon. But you can stuff them with little smokies, chicken breast, or whatever!
Have fun with it, make it yours, but always remember they are ABT's!! :)

I made these for a group camping trip, they came out amazing.  I did soak the peppers in cold water after cutting them which removed some of the bite but still left a little kick behind.  I also mixed minced garlic and chipotle seasoning into the cream cheese before stuffing the Jalapenos for some added flavor.  The flavor really develops if you make them ahead of time and store them in the fridge.

When making these, I deseed/devein half - and keep the other half with the seeds/veins in, as some like them hot - and others....not.  I also give them a nice coating of brown sugar, which caramelizes when cooked and gives you a very nice balance of flavors - sweet, spicy, savory, and generally just all around delectable goodness!

I was skeptical of this recipe at first. I thought the bacon would be undercooked. I made mine under the broiler for about 15 minutes and they are AMAZING. My adult kids went nuts on them. I bet they would even be better if made on the grill. My daughter makes them as a meal with a salad.

Two things that I do different is I cut the Jalapeno like a canoe which gives you access to seed them and a lid to put back on to keep the cream cheese inside.  Also, I finely chop cilandro and mix it in with the cream cheese.  It adds a great flavor to them.

I make these often. They are so good. I only use 1/2 slice bacon on each pepper. I also add a watermelon rine pickle slice,which I make my myself  before I wrap with bacon. Yummy! Everyone eats more than one

These are really great.  I fill the jalapeno peppers with cream cheese. Wrap with bacon and put a good amount of brown sugar to cover them up and put in a broiler.  Be sure to use a cooking service with holes in it or they get to greasy from the bacon.  Love them.  I guess if you grill them, the grease will burn off from the bacon but watch for flame ups.  They also cook great in a infared cooker.

I have been making these forever. I use the yellow/green peppers, remove the seeds. Then cut slices the Mexican cheese Quesa Fresca, not sure how that is spelled but you find it the cheese department.Put the cheese in the peppers and wrap the peppers with the bacon and cook at 400 in the oven till bacon is done. The cheese does not melt so it is perfect for this recipe. Try and enjoy.

These started getting pretty popular about 6 years ago.  I like to chop small pieces of mango and mix it in with the cream cheese then add the mixture to the jalapeno.  It's a nice sweet contrast to the heat.

Delicious!  Took some pointers and after stuffing the peppers with cream cheese and wrapping with a whole piece of bacon, I put them in the freezer for 15 mins.  Some of the cr. cheese spilled out during grilling but it was minimal.  Will definitely make these again!

Loved, loved, loved them.  Used low fat cream cheese and wore rubber gloves. I still found that I was coughing during the seeding process.  Grilling them adds a flavor like the oven just can't match. Used a grilling basket.

This was a fantastic appetizer.

Tip for Grilling - Low heat prevents flare ups.  I turned the peppers every 5 minutes.  Total grill time was about 25 minutes.

I also substituted Nufschetel Cheese for the cream cheese.  Less calories.

This is such an awesome snack food! I used fat free cream cheese and baked them in the oven on a metal grill set over a baking pan. I preheated the oven at 375 and cooked them for 25 minutes, turning the broil setting on high the last five minutes. The bacon came out crispy on the edges and just perfect! With the fat free cream cheese (I couldn't taste the difference!) each little jalapeno wrap came out to about 41 calories a piece, which isn't too bad! Next time, I'm considering jazzing them up a little, maybe crumbling some feta in with the cream cheese and sprinkling the tiniest smidge of garlic powder on top or seasoning the bacon with some rub. I will definitely be making these again in the future!

Great, not even spicy if you can't take it (just scrape out the membranes like other people mentioned). I think it is just the right amount of kick if you just take out the seeds.

So yum! Depending on where the Jalepeno's are grown, they will be hotter or a little more mild. I remove all seeds to make less spicy.

This recipe is a winner. I've made these three times. The first time my brother (experienced with cooking out) did the grilling. They came out perfectly and I got rave reviews. The second and third time I (a rookie) did the grilling. They weren't so perfect but totally delicious. This is perhaps my favorite way to eat bacon. Make these and you will have a happy family!

These are really impressive, yet fairly simple to prepare.  In my opinion, the secret is to use good bacon, so that it is easy to bite into.  Very delicious and very fun to make.  My 7 and 9 year olds gobble them up whenever I make them, and they were a real hit at my work.  Thanks

I love these things. To mix it up I combine some parmesan cheese (or asiago, romano or all 3), chipotle pepper, and smoked paprika with the cream cheese prior to filling the peppers. They turn out amazing

I've been doing these for many years.  I add 1/4 - 1/2 cup crab, 3/4 t old bay, 1/2 t lemon pepper and 1/2 t pepper.  Mix well, but leave some of the crab in chunks.  Grill or place in the oven at 400 for 20-30 minutes, keep an eye on them.  Enjoy!

Wasn't a fan of the cooked jalapeno, but the cheese mixture/bacon combo was a nice surprise. I think I'll make again using raw jalapenos and topped with crumbled bacon. ( I honestly could've eaten the cheese mixture alone-yes, it was that good )

Delicious ... why buy store bought jalapeno poppers when you can make these!  Great idea with freezing them for 15-20 minutes, help out the cooking process.  I would make these again in a heart beat.  I added a chipotle season I had from Pampered Chef.  It turned out great!

I served these last night at a dinner party.  I added a bit of chive to the cream cheese.  They were gone by the time I got back to the table about 15 mins later.  Big hit.

Go to your farmer's market for fresh peppers.  I mix the cream cheese with cumin powder and chilli powder to kick up the flavor.  Also, you can cook these in the oven on 350.  I cook the bacon a little before I wrap it around the peppers.

These are great.  I learned the hard way when my stupid dog ate all but one slice of turkey bacon when I was preparing these that they are actually very good without wrapping them in bacon too.  I baked them and broiled the last two minutes and they were great.

This is something I have never personaly made myself. But I have a friend who makes these. The only difference is he puts a medium size lightly seasoned piece of shrimp in each one. He made dozens of them for our Superbowl party and they were all devoured within the first hour!

Creamy, spicy and blanketed with crispy divine swine.  How much better does it get?  My variation has some grated cheddar and a touch of minced garlic mixed in with the cream, cheese.  Even with the variations, this is a WONDERFUL munchie.  Try it and then make it your own.

Turned out great. I made some changes, I added 1/2c cheddar and 1/4c freshly grated parm to the cream cheese. Baked at 350 for about 40mins. If you bake these put them on a broiling pan, so they dont boil to death in bacon grease.

I love these. I make them all the time. I actually got the recipe from a guy I work with. The only difference is that I mix in shredded cheddar cheese with the cream cheese (1:1 ratio) :) People are always nervous to try at first, but I never have any left over!

I use whole pickled jalapenos, and I mix Jimmy Dean Hot sausage (crumble and cook) with the cream cheese and wrap with peppered bacon from the deli or meat market.  The key to not being so hot is to rinse with cold water while de-seeding and then soak in ice cold water before stuffing.  Also putting them in the freezer before grilling helps the cheese not to run .

Great recipe, but I took a chance and changed it because I had no bbq and I had no toothpicks.  I used the whole pepper, cut the top off, carefully took the seeds out with a butter knife.  cream cheese I added chives, garlic and lemon jiuce and cajun seasoning.  Stuffed the pepper wrapped them with a whole slice of bacon and put the end side of bacon down  first so hopefully it would not unwrap.  Then put the top back of the pepper to keep the cheese in and baked until bacon was crispy enough.  Loved them.  It worked great.

Loved these.  I used Garlic/Chive Cream Cheese with shredded Bacon Cheddar and a little asiago.  Big Warning...wear gloves when seeding.  I made the mistake of not wearing gloves once and payed the price of having burning hands for several hours.

Super yummy. I halved the jalapeno's left the seeds and such inside. I then boiled for about 4 minutes, then cut out the seeds and such. I also opted for vegetarian morning star bacon. I broiled for about 20 mins super good!!

These were very good.  I did drop the peppers into boiling water for a few minutes after cleaning them.  I also added some ranch dressing to the cream cheese.  They were so good!  I made them again the next day!

They were ok. 8 ounces of cream cheese is way more than enough for 6 peppers.

update: I used the rest of the cream cheese, omitted the bacon, added cheddar and cooked a little longer and they were tres fab!!

This is an awesome recipe! 6 jalapenos are never enough for a small crowd when I make them. My slight change to the recipe was to use cream cheese with chives. Next time maybe I'll try adding Season All salt or onion/garlic powder. Who knows. I also bake mine in the oven instead of the grill. WARNING: Always remember to wear gloves (your hands and your eyes will thank you if happen to touch them), and if you are preparing a lot of jalapenos you might want to have good air circulation around. My kids and husband can feel the burn in the air.

I made this this past weekend and didn't care for them. I cooked them until almost burnt and the bacon was still chewy! I'm thinking I'm going to pan fry in butter for a min ute before I put them on the grill. Also on another note if you don't like the heat of the jalapeno when you de-seed if you scrap out the white veiny stuff it kilss almost all of the heat.

These are great.  I used toothpicks, halved, to secure bacon.  Also cooked in the oven one day when I could't grill.  They were wonderful that way also.

I prepared this a couple of days ago. Concerned about the heat I followed some reviewer's instructions and let the jalapenos rest in cold water for about 15 minutes. Mistake. The jalapenos ended up tasting like regular bell peppers. After grilling did not have heat at all! Using just cream cheese is also pretty lame. It is just too simple for a filling, so I would recommend following some instructions to add a little more flavor to the filling. I will try this again without trying to remove the heat from the jalapenos, and adding something "extra" to the filling.

I love making these.  I usually make them a different way though.  Try using pepper jack cheese instead of cream cheese, and also add a meat!  I've made it with shrimp wrapped up inside and even dove breast!

I love spicy food but this was way to spicy!!! Parts of the bacon weren't able to cook due to the way it overlapped itself around the jalapeno. My guests were not able to eat them due to the extreme spiciness of them so I threw them in the oven to cook the bacon and peppers more evenly and thoroughly. After cooking them for an hour on 350 they were much tastier and more tolerable for my guests to eat. Will not grill again but will definitely bake in the oven.

I am giving this 3 stars without having tasted them yet as they are in the oven as I type (dont have a grill) But the 3 stars are for preparation.  The Jalapeno's are a pain to devein and de-seed dont know how anyone is doing this to feed a party and I only did 8 just to try the recipe. does anyone have  a better suggestion on how to do this? I did it with a paring knife.  I did customize the recipe a bit.  I am a woose when it comes to heat so I am trying with 4 japapenos and 4 baby sweet peppers just in case.  Also added real crab claw meat  minced the tips of the peppers,  minced garlic and a dash of old bay to the cream cheese.

These are GREAT!!!!! I made them for gameday this past Sunday, and I took others advice by mixing in shredded cheese with whipped cream cheese........AWESOME!!!! I would grill the peppers abit first next time to soften them (unless you want a little crunch then cook as is). Overall a great appetizer though.

I've made these twice in the oven and they went pretty fast. The second time, I made a spicy berry sauce for dipping with a jar of jam and the seeds from the jalapenos. Once the sauce boiled and liquified, I used a strainer to separate the sauce from the seeds. It is good with or without the berry sauce, but I think its a nice bonus.

We have been making these for several years and they are gone so quickly at parties! It takes a while to make them, but if you can get an assembly line going it's better and more fun to do together!  We do a mixture of cream cheese and sausage.  Just mix them both together.  We've also done cream cheese and one raw shrimp in the middle which was AWESOME.  I think we will try some of the suggestions here though, like the ranch packet and freezing them.  Awesome recipe though!

okay this is a party in your mouth....been making this for years...it is also delicious if you add a packet of hidden valley ranch seasoning in the cream cheese....the hint of heat from the jalapeno creamyness and coolness of the cream cheese and the saltyness of the bacon is amazing....(:

My favorite food! We add raw shrimp on top of the cream cheese and then wrap them. We make a ton at a time and they are work but so worth it. You can use light cream cheese and turkey bacon. Don't forget your gloves.

These were Amazing. I made them last night- followed many suggestions of freezing before grilling, and I'm glad I did. I also added a thin slice of sharp cheddar inside the wrap. I decided to grill them on foil because I was a little concerned about too much fire. I also learned that while blanching them to remove some of the heat, it's best to use the side burner on a grill (which I'd never used before) as the oils from my jalapenos become airborne and I started coughing and crying from the burning- although these were abnormally hot so maybe that contributed too. 

We will definitely make these again as I've got a garden full of them and can handle only so much salsa :-)

These things are awesome. We have been making these "jalapeno poppers" for years, but we add a cocktail weenie on top of the cream cheese, before you wrap with bacon!  We always receive praises for this recipe!  You MUST wear glove when seeding though!

Excellent recipe if you like your food spicy. It was a hit at my last bbq party. However I've altered the ingredients list a bit using pickled chilies instead of fresh jalapenos.

These are amazing. I mixed the cream cheese with powdered margarita mix and they are to die for. Not sure how much of the mix i put in i just did it to taste. Definately try them this way.

My mama and I have made this recipe for years. The only difference in our recipe is that we put shrimp and/or crab meat with the cream cheese. We also make ours on gril we bought for the stove and it is absolutely purrfect :)

Quite good. I made them as written and enjoyed them. I would like to try some changes suggested by other reviewers. I think a small amount of a sweet bbq sauce on the bacon would be delicious. I had the broiler going, so chose to broil them. I place aluminum foil in the grilling pan and used a small grill to raise them.

These were fantastic!!!  I agree with other reviewers though, the cream cheese does need a little jazzing up.  Pretty easy to make, and they make a great presentation.

We make these every time we BBQ. We cut the jalapenos in half and cut the stems off, then we scrap the seeds out, be careful for flying seeds! They seem to turn up everywhere, and use gloves if you become sensitive to the jalapeno heat. You can also bake them in the oven at 375 until they are crisp, the bacon fat always makes it tastier but less healthy.

We make these all the time, have made many variations and cooked different ways. Favorite has been adding some cooked and cooled chunks or crumbled italian sausage to top of cream cheese before wrapping with the bacon. Can also mix dry ranch seasoning with cream cheese and some finely chopped chives to add a nice touch of flavor. Those two have been the biggest hits for our family and friends. We have also found making ahead and chilling is best method and we prefer to bake on a piece of foil on a cookie sheet  at 350 for 30-45 minutes the easiest way to go, easiest clean up too  =)

For those who can't grill, these can also be baked in the oven: line the lower part of a broiling pan with foil or cover a sheet pan (with lips) with foil and place a rack on top of it (I use a nonstick cookie cooling rack) and bake at 400 until the bacon's crisp. I haven't tried broiling, but I'm sure it would work, too!

I made these for a party I had for friends and were the first to go... GREAT flavor and easy to make.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 is the bacon needed to cook longer to become crisp.

These are amazing.  We added shredded sharp cheddar to the cream cheese.  Also, used a peppered bacon which was fabulous.  I tried both suggestions of olive oil and tequila after deseeding the jalapenos.  It killed a lot of the heat for our less adventurous guests.

I took into acct some of the suggestions from other reviewers.  What I found worked is to de-seed and take out only part of the membranes if you still like a little heat.  I made two types of fillings.  One with fresh herbs from my garden and the other I used a berry cream cheese which paired nicely with the saltyness of the bacon. Also, 1/2 a piece of bacon is plenty and make the jalapeno/cheese mix ahead of time and freeze or else the cheese will leak out the sides and the bacon wont cook through.  Otherwise, these were so tasty and were gone within minutes of coming off the grill!

My husband tore through these!  We did them in the oven - baked for about 35 minutes at 350, then hit them with the broiler to crisp up the bacon.
Definitely throw in freezer for 20-30 mins first to prevent the cream cheese from leaking out.

I added dry ranch mix and shredded cheddar cheese to these.  The flavor was very good.  I did freeze them prior to grilling.  I will put them in the oven next time, as the bacon did not have time to get crisp before the cheese was melting out.

These are AMAZING.  I did change the recipe a little bit but I imagine they would be great as is.  I added 1/4 cup of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella.  I also added pepper, garlic powder and salt.  I baked them at 450 for 20 min.  I made them for a dinner party last week & every person there asked for the recipe.  Thank you for such a wonderful treat!

When I make this, I use breakfast sausage. Brown breakfast sausage, drain and then add cream cheese and mix well. Spoon that into the jalapeno and then wrap with bacon. Bake for 20-25 min's.

These were nice... I added some ranch mix with the cream cheese. Also used a whole piece of bacon. The inner bacon wasn't crispy though. Boiled the peppers for about 1-2 minutes before filling.

These were a big hit at my bbq! They did take a bit of prep work but I was able to prep them 2 nights before the party. I would definatly like to say that you should definatly use gloves when cutting and seeding them. I use jalapenos offten when I cook but had never made such a large quantity and my hands were burning by the time I was done. I mixed the cream cheese with creole seasoning which made it even better. I also soaked the jalapenos in cool water for about 2-3 minutes and they were not very hot at all. I would only use half a strip of bacon on each any more than that is overkill I think. I also would try to bake them either partially or all the way. On the grill they were kind of hard to cook since you can't flip them over.

These are delicious.  My only change to the recipe was that I precooked the bacon a bit in the microwave.  They are perfect for even those that don't appreciate things spicy.  If you remove the seeds and vein, they aren't overly spicy.

Oh yeah... I have been making these for several years. I use chive and onion cream cheese spread and add chopped PECANS with the cream cheese spread...adds great flavor and texture....do not skimp on the bacon and no toothpicks needed...make sure the "cut" end of the bacon meets on the bottom. They are great broiled as well...nice and crispy bacon.

These were a huge hit at a bbq.  I pre-cooked the bacon a little (pre-crispy stage) so the poppers didn't have to grill as long - no cheese leakage.  I've also baked these in the oven and toaster oven -again using pre-cooked bacon.  They came out great everytime.  I will make these again and again.

These were really good. I made a couple of changes. After I split the peppers I blanch them in boiling water and then in ice water. (to soften them) I used flavored whipped cream cheese garlic and onion. These turned out great in oven at 375 degress on baking sheet for 20 to 25 minutes.

These were pretty good, but a little bit bland.  I will definitely make them again, but next time I'll try seasoning the cream cheese with some herbs, garlic, and maybe a little salt.  Also, I found that whole slices of bacon were way too much, so I cut the slices in half and they were the perfect size to cover the peppers.  One word of warning to those who want to make these on a charcoal grill:  I had to finish them in the oven, because the bacon grease was causing a huge flare-up on my charcoal, with flames reaching a good two feet into the air.  I put the partially cooked peppers on a cooling rack set on a baking sheet and baked them for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees F.  Cooking the peppers took away virtually all of the spicy heat and the cream cheese helps counter any heat that's left.  Even children should be able to eat these without a problem.  I ate four whole peppers on my own (8 halves)!  I can't wait until the Mexican grocery store has jalapenos on sale so I can have these again!

My boyfriend and I loved these!  I just added a dash of garlic powder on top of the cream cheese, but could barely taste it, so they would probably be the same without.  I did freeze them for 15 minutes, as others suggested.  I forgot the toothpicks, but it was not a problem at all.  And for the reviewer who said to wear gloves...I did not wear any and was just fine, but I did all seed removal under running water, so maybe that helped.

These are good and pretty much foolproof. My bf said they are one of the best things he has ever tasted!! well i didnt think they were THAT good, but he and i do have different tastes. he said that it was because they have all three of his faves in one: cheese, jalapenos and bacon! lol..well, since he gave it such rave reviews, ill definately copy this onto my personal recipes collection for the future

I love this recipe and have made these for years.  However, I always had trouble with the fumes when I cut and de-seeded the jalapenos.  The fumes would be so bad that I felt like I was having an asthma attack.  I tried wearing a face mask and de-seeding them under running water - still had problems.  Today, in a flash of inspiration, I cut and cleaned them entirely submerged under water.  I put the wooden cutting board on the bottom of my sink and filled the sink with water.  I cut off the ends, cut them in half, and removed the seeds completely under water, then laid them on a paper towel to dry before adding cream cheese and bacon.  Voila!  Absolutely NO fumes, no burning or choking or gasping.  Also, I bought some specialty cream cheese that has blue cheese mixed in, and that was really a nice variation on the plain cream cheese.  I do these in the oven when the weather is bad, and they turn out just as good.  When I serve these, my guests rave!

These are awesome! I've been making these for about a year now, I can't enough of them! And they are so easy!  I used philly vegetable lite cream cheese, I have also tried making them in the toaster oven if I don't want to bother with bbq and they are still great.

These were Awesome! I've wanted to make these for some time, and finally had the time yesterday. I did add just a bit of garlic powder and sea salt to the cream cheese. These were so good, I think they'd be fantastic as written. My husband and I couldn't stop eating these...very addictive! If you'll soak the toothpicks in water for a few minutes, they won't burn when grilling. Thanks for sharing.

OMG we made these today and they were awesome! I boiled the peppers and that did help with the heat. Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and and soak the peppers maybe overnight. My hubby can eat them raw with no problem but even tho I love the taste my palette cant take the heat. I wish I had seen the tip about freezing them before hand to keep the cheese from melting.I will try that next time too. But they were so good. I am also going to cut the stem end off and clean them out and stuff that way to keep more cheese from melting out and hopefully reduce the heat as that end is the hottest. Seemed like the slit method lost alot of cheese. We did a have a few flare ups but that made the bacon crispy and so delicious. This is definitely a keeper. We will be making these again for labor day!

My house is full of bacon lovers, so this was a wonderful treat for them. We like to do a 50/50 mix of cream cheese and shredded cheddar. Wearing gloves is a great idea (specially if you wear contacts. Burns for a very long time when you take out your contacts!)

I made this for a cookout. Everyone loved it including me. To save some time I'm going to add crumble bacon on top of cream cheese instead of wrapping it. I think it will be just as good but I will let you know.

These were a hit at my last party. Little time-consuming but well worth it! If you're going to use the broiler to cook these...I recommend broiling the jalapenos first, then fill and wrap with bacon. Because the bacon is slightly cook before wrapping, when you put these back in the broiler it only takes a few minutes to finish cooking the bacon and sometimes the jalapenos don't get that cooked (browned).

We did not care for these at all. Lacking a lot of flavor. I added some garlic powder to the cream cheese and it still was not enough. Not a keeper for us!

These tast great, but were difficult to cook. Bacon on a grill? It kept flaring up and burning everything. I will try this again using my toaster overn on broil and see what happens.

LOVE THESE!  I looked up the recipe because my friend made them and we couldn't stop eating them.  He makes them with maple-flavored bacon, and OH MY GOODNESS, the mixture of hot and sweet is amazing.  I highly recommend that substitution.  And great idea in the other reviews about refrigerating ahead of time to avoid the cream cheese leaking out!  Thanks!!

I've made these for years and we do them a little different. Almost any way is great! A helpful hint is to buy the pre-cooked bacon. It makes them perfect by the time the cheese melts, also we slice jalapeno-jack and put it into the peppers(for those who like a little extra kick)!

I made a huge batch of these little devils so I was lucky enough to have leftovers.  Here are a few of the great ways I used them up: 
1) Slice them up and use them to top pizza (with a little chicken and roasted red pepper), hamburgers, quesadillas, or nachos  
2) Mix them into potato soup or chili 
3) Add them to artichoke or spinach dip  
4) Make a baked potato happy
5) Add to cornbread batter
6) Stir into ranch dressing for an amazing salad topper
Is anyone else getting hungry?  Time to get cooking!

We don't use toothpicks. We cook these on a broiler pan in the oven at 400 for about 35-45 minutes(with the bottom pan lined with foil for easy clean up). Using the broiler pan ensures the jalapenos don't end up swimming in bacon grease. Also, try putting honey on the bacon before wrapping the jalapeno - it adds a nice flavor! My sister didn't know about the honey and kept asking me what kind of bacon I was using, because the flavor was so good.

Excellent!  My wife and I love these, although we couldn't get any of the kids to try them.  The wraps made from garden grown jalapenos were much hotter than the grocery variety, but still great!

These were pretty good.  I baked them rather than cooking them on the grill and they came out pretty greasy.  I will try again on the grill or in the oven on a broiler pan.  It seemed like it took a while to prepare only to end up with a  small amount of appetizers.  I have considered making the Jalapeno Popper Dip in place of these...

Our grill died a slow death, so I'm happy that I could use the oven.  I baked them at  425 for 20 minutes and then broiled to crisp the bacon.  I took out the seeds and membranes. They had a little heat, but not much.  Perfect for our family. On some of the peppers I used a whole slice of bacon and other only half.  Awesome appetizer!  Will make again soon!

I followed recipe almost exactly substituting turkey bacon for regular. It was very, very good. My husband ate them all up! Also, since it was raining I cooked them up in my toaster oven at 450 degrees. Yummy!

MMMM!!! Very tasty! Very small change I made was to sprinkle garlic powder on before wrapping with bacon. Grilled on medium heat about 10 minutes on each side, starting with cut side down so that the cream cheese didn't all melt out. Bacon cooked up nice. Peppers were done just right. Extremely quick and easy! Good recipe!

These are sooooo delicious!  I baked mine for 20 minutes at 375 degrees and then broiled until the bacon was crispy.  I took them to a party and they were gone in 10 minutes!  Definitely try to make sure to get out as much of the membrane as possible...people who are afraid to try them will try a small one, and those are the ones that tend to be spicier since it is harder to get the membrane out.  You might scare those people off!  Incredibly delicious though.

Awesome! Spiced up the cream cheese mixture with cheddar cheese, part of a ranch packet, and worch. sauce. For some reason, the jalapenos I used were super, super spicy (and we like spice) so cannot wait to make again with the suggestion of boiling the jalapenos in hot water for a few minutes first.

This is very good..To some it is looked at to be a bit warm, and to others, not quite warm enough.  The secret to keeping the heat in the dish is to leave the peppers structure on the inside alone.  (the white lining, and seeds)  To take out the heat of the pepper, simply take all the seeds and internal structure out to where you have nothing but a green halved pepper.  Very tasty and original, wonderful app.

These are awesome!  In one of my teenage jobs I had the opportunity to work under a five-star chef and he taught me how to make these.  Since then, I've brought these to parties pretty frequently and they always get rave reviews.  Just my poor heart's luck that I could eat these bacon-y bites all day!!!

These are so yummy.  But warning be careful when you go to eat them that they've cooled off enough, the cheese filling will be hotter than you think.  I burned the roof of my mouth.  OUCH!

Fantastic!  Smoky, cheesy, and just plain good!  Cooking jalapenos mellows the spice, so next time I may leave some seeds in when I stuff them.

I love these to bits.  They are always a big hit. But I have to strongly recommend trying a bit of a variation--stuff them with shrimp and monterrey jack.

Yes these are amazing, but I would soak the toothpicks in water for 5-10 min. before sticking in the peppers(as you'd do for wooden shish-k-bob sticks). 
I love how these taste!

Our family makes these all the time.  I use 1/3 to 1/2 slice of bacon as to not find the bacon flavor too overpowering.  Also, I put a large pinch of brown sugar on top to add a little different taste.  I also use 1/3 fat or fat free cream cheese and when cooking for my diabetic grandfather, I use brown sugar Splenda he so can enjoy also.

Love these! We baked in the oven on 350 for 15-20 minutes. I think I may have turned up to 400 for a few minutes at the end. Worked for us. We will make again.

HEY - you stole my recipe!  Just kidding...I've been making this exact thing from years (atually learned from my brother, who makes them often).  They are always a hit and everyone who tries them starts making them themselves.

Not sure why anyone would add to the recipe - it's perfect just the way it is, jalapenos, cream cheese and bacon.  I stretch the bacon as far as it will stretch before wrapping around so it's thin and cook faster and gets crispier.

People eat them up as fast as we take them off the grill.

This recipe was easy and my boyfriend loved them! I cooked them on medium and turned them once. Turned out perfect.    I would just like to remind everyone to wear gloves when working with jalapenos.  Thanks for the recipe its a new house favorite!

Delicious! To the cream cheese, I added cajun seasoning and cheddar cheese. I cooked them in the oven on a baking rack to keep them out of the grease. These peppers turned out great !!

These are really good. We made them this summer on outdoor grill. The only complaint I have is to watch out for the smoke and steam from the peppers...it can really burn your eyes.

Wow these were great on a campout we had. We used both turkey bacon and regular bacon. I liked the turkey, but hubby and sons like the regular. We also tried putting the halves back together as one review suggested...was less messy grilling but we like the ones where we wrapped the half with bacon better. Keep your eye on them while grilling as to not burn them.

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  I use whipped cream cheese flavored with chives.  I also cut the bacon slices in half lenghtwise, they seem to wrap better and hold the pepper while baking.

this is great if you like things bland, but  for more of a kick, I mix some garlic powder and cayenne pepper in with the cream cheese.  And you can cut the bacon in half to make even more!  Also, be sure to soak the toothpicks in water, or they'll burn on the grill!

These are great on a camping trip. Easy and so little needed to make them. My kids call them grilled rats since a little stem left on the end reminds them of a tail.

This was a hit!  I made it with water chestnuts soaked in soy sauce and brown sugar stuffed in the middle of the poppers.  Everyone loved it.  Was a surprise too, whether each individual popper was going to be spicy or not.

Awesome recipe. Been making this for years. It is always a hit with company. Found that half a piece of bacon per stuffed jalapeno is more than enough. Also, a toothpick helps hold it all together in the grill.

I made these based on the review by  CHARSKI.  I used the Embasa canned jalapenos.  After slicing them in two, and removing most of their seeds, I turned them open side down onto paper towels and let them drain.  Then I stuffed them with a combo of softened cream cheese and shredded Mexican cheese blend (4 different cheeses).  I rolled them in the parmesan cheese (instead of shaking them in a bag), and that way I was able to control how much they got on them.

They did take awhile to assemble, and 45 minutes to cook...so next time I'll know better.  I was late to the party I was taking them to.

Everyone loved them...definitely a hit!

This recipe is very good.  Sometimes the jalapenos can be really hot though.  I usually soack the jalepenos in water for a week to reduce the spicyness of them.

..as written these would be good, but a bit bland.  I was trying to use up some dip I made this week and came across this recipe.  (I mixed cream cheese with diced roasted red pepper, green onion, sharp cheddar, garlic powder)and stuffed my peppers with that.  Wrapped them in 1/2 slice of bacon and grilled until bacon was crisp. Husband ate all but 2.  These will definitely be made every time we fire up the grill!

This was heaven in my mouth! I soaked my jalapeños in cold water for a couple hours. I used cream cheese and grated cheddar. I didn’t pre cook my bacon and baked it until the bacon was slightly crisp but not crunchy. The leftovers (not many) were delicious even a couple days later warmed in the microwave.

We make these as written and they are great! But, I usually make various flavors to meet all my guests tastes. One flavor is add a handful of shredded cheese, cooked and crumbled breakfast sausage (ground HOT Jimmy Dean), little ranch powder mix, and some Parmesan cheese. We also do Parmesan and roasted garlic flavor wrapped in maple bacon. I cook mine on the porcelain broiler pan (usually comes with oven) at 350’ for an hour. It’s the cooking that weakens the heat of the pepper. I have done them on the grill, but watch for flare ups. I also use one piece of bacon per pepper, seems to stay on better and does not need a toothpick to hold in place.

I have made these in the oven many times. But on the grill is really so much better. I also took one of the suggested changes of adding a packet of hidden valley ranch dressing mix to cream cheese WOW. !!! Next level

I made this with a few changes.  To the cream cheese I added a  cup  of shredded cheddar, a teaspoon of miced garlic, and  a tablespoon of  basil.  Mixed all  together then filled my  cut, seeded and rinsed halves.  Wrap with bacon,  place on the the grill and cook away for 10 to 15 depending on the grill! Enjoy with your favorite  dressing, ranch bleu cheese or whatever... my family loves these!

These are excellent. In the past, I tried hollowing the peppers out and stuffing them with cream cheese, but halving them is much easier and tastes just as good. I sometimes add taco seasoning and whip the cream cheese. Handy trick: Use the bottom of  a cardboard egg container (not styrofoam, of course) and put a wrap in each space. This will soak up the bacon grease, giving you a better result and less mess.

It tasted good, but when we flipped them on the grill the cheese ran out thru the bacon and I took someone's advice and put them in the freezer for 15 min first.  I don't like raw bacon so not sure how to do this so the bacon gets done without the cheese running out and no clue in the recipe how to solve that problem.

These poppers are absolutely delicious! The only thing that I changed was I added onions and shredded cheddar cheese into the creamcheese stuffing. My family can’t get enough of them!

One more "course" you can serve straight from the grill (no plates) early or late-night. Pairs well with whiskey drinks (not good with beer or any carbonated drink). Cook until the bacon looks like what you prefer at breakfast; fat in the cheese and bacon takes the heat off the peppers. Easy recipe.

I tried this recipe out...I followed some other suggestions but other reviewers.  I mixed a cup of grated cheddar cheese into the cream cheese and also did some with ranch dressing mix mixed in.  I also baked them on a rack over a cookie sheet at 375 degrees.  The issue I had is that the bacon didn't get that crisp.  If I made them again, I'd probably try broiling them the last couple min.   They were yummy and everyone ate them...but very time consuming to do a large batch for a party and make sure you definitely wear gloves or your hands will be on fire!!

Great tasting and easy to make. I use toothpicks to hold the bacon in place. I found with grilling, the bacon may stick to the grill and unravel if the grating isn't fully cured. I've also broiled these as well and worked very well.

These have been my go to appetizers for the past year and they always draw rave reviews and disappear quickly. I like to add garlic powder to taste to the cream cheese (we like approximately 1/2 teaspoon per block of cream cheese) and mix it up in a Ziplock bag. Zip it up, knead till mixed, snip off a corner and it pipes beautifully into the pepper half. Perhaps others mentioned this; I didn't bother reading all the other reviews. :)

Like it.  Two changes:  1) to reduce calories (by reducing cream cheese) and add crunchiness, incorporate  enough minced bell pepper to displace 1/3 or 1/2 the cream cheese.  2) As another reviewer noted, keep the pepper intact with a "T" cut.  At the stem end, cut nearly all the way through severing the core.  Make a perpendicular cut lengthwise along the top.  This leaves the pepper largely intact.  Scoop out the core with a small spoon (and as needed cut core out).

This is good, but a basic jalepeño popper recipe.  We added some chipotle raspberry salsa to the cream cheese.  The flavor was delicious.

Always a favourite in my home. I don't have a grill, so I did 400 degrees in the oven in a baking dish for about 25-30min. Sometimes I'll cook ground sausage and mix the cream cheese in, then spoon it onto the peppers. These poppers taste great served chilled too!

I made them in the oven at 300 for 40 mins. FOund the low slow method ensured the jalepenos was cooked and the bacon wasn’t overcooked.
They disappear in a heart beat. 
Double the recipe for a crowd.

Good GRIEF these are good! I didn't do a single extra step, either. I bought the ingredients home and left the cream cheese out to soften a bit while I got the coals ready. My wife did the prep work for me and I put them on the grill for about 5 minutes per side. That's it.

Neither one of us are the type to like really spicy food, but with all the seeds and membranes scraped out we found these had just the right kick.  I didn't even see the reviews and suggestions until after I came back to write the review.

For me at least, I didn't have any problems at all with the cheese running out or too much heat, nothing. We did it exactly like the video. We couldn't stop talking about how fantastically good these things are. MAN!

I've made this a few times now and they're so good! Try mixing a flavor into the cream cheese - like half a packet of dry ranch dressing mix. I also boil the peppers for about 5 mins before making them to cut the heat - but that's of course a personal preference since I can't handle too much heat.

Loved this recipe!  I read the reviews and did boil the jalapenos in water for 5 minutes, used cream cheese & added chipotle seasoning.  Make sure you use all the same size peppers and totally wrap the bacon over the filling.

Loved these! I would definitely spend the money on good bacon. We used a brand on sale and there was too much grease from the fat. Next time we'll get the apple wood bacon we love.
Awesome filling and easy prep. We're doing this again soon!

Tried it in the oven after soaking the peppers for 20 minutes in ice water.  It was interesting - still a bit hot for my taste.  Popular. With others though.

I  Also blanched the peppers 10min. then threw in ice water. I put all made up peppers in the frig for 2 hours to make really firm before baking. So easy and so good ! My husband and son loved them when I made for Christmas dinner appetizer. Making again this Christmas too. Thanks so much!

I make this a few times a summer and they are a hit.  Make sure the bacon gets cooked all the way through.  Freeze the poppers for an hour before grilling to keep everything together when it hits the grill.  I blend seasonings into the cream cheese to give extra flavor.

I have made these a few times. The first few times I made them on a gas grill. Um, I think they may have significantly shortened the lifespan of my gas grill. heh heh heh.  
Anyway, I have a very good friend who loves these. This past week I visited the friend and made a large batch for a group. Since I was visiting the area I didn't have a grill and could not find a throw-away charcoal grill thing.  After reading many of the comments here, I gave my friend's oven a try. Not. the. same. My suggestion is to only use the oven as a last resort.  
Now my quest is the work up different recipes for the cheese stuffing. Tonight I am trying a few with pepper jack cheese for an extra bite. By the way, the ones I made last week were not spicy hot at all if all the seeds and membranes were removed. 
I am not sure why other commenters suggest par-boiling the jalapeños.  You really cannot go wrong with these: jalapeños, cheese and bacon. Grilled.
P.S. I am glad I viewed the video for this recipe. It had not occurred to me to cook them open side down then turn. I will try that method this evening, so I have the wrapped peppers in the freezer now. 
Enjoy these excellent fun morsels!

I didn't do anything special with the jalapeños - without the seeds, the heat is pretty much gone. With the cream cheese, they really aren't spicy, but then again I tend to have a high heat tolerance. The only thing different that I did was that I baked the jalapeños instead of grilling them. About 20-25 minutes in the oven at 400º and they were very nicely done. I may have missed out on the grilled flavor, but the oven still works well if a grill isn't an option.

Great! I made some of these with veggie bacon and it still worked well. Remember to completely seed the jalapeños and stuff in as much cream cheese as you can. Even if you aren't a jalapeño person, you will like this because once the seeds are removed and the peppers are grilled there is only a small amount of spice left.

I made this as an appetizer at Easter. The company loved it! I will definitely make this again. What was surprising was there was very little heat to the peppers. I may leave a couple of seeds in next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I make these regularly.  Sometimes they are the main dish!  Tips: First, wear gloves if you are not used to handling jalapeños.  Trust me on this. Second, use a small melon baller for quick removal of the seeds and membranes.  Third, bacon is greasy (obviously) and the flames on the grill will flare up and result in uneven roasting (i.e, Don't catch the porch on fire. That's a story for another day.) Fourth, cooking them in the oven will result in more even roasting and you won't loose the cheese in the flames.  Yummy!

We called 'em Rockets in Texas, short for Rectum Rockets. If you leave enough membrane and seeds in the jalapenos you'll know why.  Can't make too many, they are always gone.

I've used this recipe for the last four years for our annual office tailgate party by request. My coworkers and family love it. The only ingredient change that I use is pickled jalapeños and I add shredded cheese and garlic powder to the cream cheese.

Delicious!  After I half the peppers and clean them out,  I shake a bit of Parmesan cheese and a bit of garlic powder into the pepper.  Then I slice off a piece of cream cheese (small, less than an ounce) and roll it into a log, kind of resembles a small cigarette.  Put the cig into the pepper, wrap pretty tight with a slice of raw bacon, toothpick, and put it in the freezer for maybe 1/2 hour.  Put them on the top small rack on the grill, maybe 25 minutes.  Just delicious!

Super delicious.  I par cooked the bacon in the microwave before wrapping the peppers so that the bacon would come out perfectly done and crispy.  These were a hit with my guests, I wish I had made more.

Skeptical at first but when they are done. They became the hit of the party. Everyone was asking for more. I made 20 pieces of 12 people and they are screaming for more!! I substitute cream cheese with Gorgonzola cheese though. They were super!!

I made these for super bowl. And we won the appetizer contest. These are amazing. No need to tweak. But I put Chipotle seasoning (mrs.dash) into the cream cheese. They were amaze balls. Thanks for the recipe.

These were a total hit for me and my guests! I baked mine instead of grilling because I really didn't feel like grilling. I added about 1 cup of Mexican 4 blend cheese to the cream cheese along with 1 clove of minced garlic and a dash of smoked paprika. This made 24 appetizers. I made them the day in advance and then baked them at 400* for about 40 minutes. I then broiled them to crisp up for just a few minutes. They were fantastic!

I add a cup of shredded cheese, a 1/4 cup of minced scallion, garlic powder and mixed (using a stand-up mixer). Based on the tips of other reviewers, we freeze ours for a few minutes and then bake at 350 for 20 minutes. They get too incinerated on our grill. 
Tip on the heat factor: membrane and seeds cause the heat. We remove all seeds and membrane and rinse and dry before filling. If you like it spicy, keep the membrane; and if you want fire! keeps the seeds also.

These were awesome. Easy to make and very tasty. I took them as an appetizer to a dinner party last night and they were gone fast. I have always been hesitant to try recipes with whole jalapenos, this was my first try, and I ate several of them. I did remove all the membranes and seeds and they were not too hot, just right. I liked the simplicity of the recipe only needing 3 ingredients so I stuck with it like that. I will definitely be making these again and may try some of the variations mentioned in the reviews. They all sounded tasty!

I've made these dozens of times but I change two things.
-Only use thick cut, pepper bacon.  Most recipes call for thin bacon and I have no idea why. Thick. Pepper. Bacon.
-Slow cook on the BBQ at 250.  It takes about 2 hours.  If you can use apple wood it adds some nice flavor.
This appetizer is ALWAYS a hit.

I've made this plenty of times with jalapeno and banana peppers fresh from our family garden! I've also tried this with crumbling the bacon and putting that into the cream cheese shredded cheddar cheese mix with garlic and herb seasoning...then wrapping it into crescent rolls and baking them! Delicious!!!

I tweeked it like I always do to recipes. I used fresh jalapenos from my garden(seeded and de-veined... always wear gloves), filled with herbed goat cheese, wrapped with bacon then froze for about 15" to hold together better on grill (also used a locking basket on the grill to hold together). They were delicious just like that, but then I added my favorite Raspberry/Jalapeno Ambrosia to boot.  YUM!!!

This turned out great at my last get together! It was the first snack to disappear. It's surprisingly mild considering that you're eating a jalapeño. I added green onions and dill weed to the cream cheese and put them in the oven covered with foil for 25 to 30 minutes at 350. I'm definitely making these again.

This was okay by itself. I made them again and kicked up the flavors. I used large jalapeno peppers halved and seeded, mixed the room temperature cream cheese with 1/4 finely shredded cheddar cheese, 1 tbsp. fresh cilantro minced, 2 minced green onions, and 1/4 cup smoked gouda, grated. I wrapped them in thin sliced bacon and we broiled them instead of cooking them on the grill. They were fantastic.

Yes, it had good flavor, especially when mixing the cheese w worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. Be warned, however, that boiling jalapenos is like making pepper spray in your kitchen! Much, much worse than cutting an onion.

We have been grilling stuffed jalepenos for years; same basic recipe, but we own a grilling rack that holds about 20 jalepenos, which are positioned upright over the grill.  However you do it, stuffed jalepenos on the grill, with bacon and stuffed with a variety of filings (shrimp, sausage, crab meat, whatever) just can't come out bad!

These are to DIE for! I did them in the oven and they came out nice and crispy. I've used this recipe over and over and everyone loves it every time.

I make these but before I wrap the bacon, I place a small smoky link sausage on the cream cheese.   Never do them on the grill for fear of burning.   I just bake them in the oven.  MMM MMM Good!    I don't like spicy or hot foods but if you get all the seeds out, they are safe!!!

These were fabulous and first appetizer gobbled up at our party.  Easy to make, although seeding the jalapeños(30 for me!) can tickle your throat a bit and make your fingertips tingle. Take a fresh air break and wash your hands every so often. We roasted the peppers on our indoor electric grill and turned them over with tongs as the bacon became crispy on each side.  Will definitely make again!

I always get asked to make this for church functions.  But I don't grill mine, I bake them in the oven for about 30-35 minutes at 425 degrees.  Or sometimes I don't even time it, I just keep checking until the bacon is done and crispy

I make a version of these but use thin strips of boneless pork chops, season them up and put a small peice in one half of the pepper and spread cream cheese in the other, do the rest the same with the toothpicks and bacon. i like having some meat inside and it pairs awesome with the bacon and cream cheese!

I absolutely love making these poppers. We did add a couple of things to this recipe though. We sliced medium cooked shrimp and placed it on top of the cream cheese and sprinkled it with old bay before we wrapped them with bacon. Best ones we made yet. Will definitely continue to make them with our revisions.

One of my absolute favorite things to eat -ever!  I added (per reviews advice) warcestershire sauce and garlic powder to the cream cheese, boil the jalapenos to take the crunch and the bite out, and cook the bacon almost completely before wrapping.  I also added a thin strip of seasoned, cooked venison to each before throwing them on the grill.  Everyone who tried them said the same thing..."This is literally the best thing I have ever eaten."  The one down side is that it takes for-ever to make!!  I think it will be a holiday recipe that will be made by a handful of people together to make it go faster (more fun that way anyway!)

I have made a this with my own added ingredients. I add drained rinsed cottage cheese, two eggs to bind the ingredients, fried crispy bacon crumbles, parsley, curry (all to taste)works great grill or oven. If you end up with two much 'stuffing' place in an oven safe dish lined with parchment and bake until lightly browned and serve on crackers. (I add a bit of chopped green chili to this)

Everyone at our party loved them,  I thought they were ok, could have had a little more depth of flavor but were good all the same.  Some folks recommended different variations and I would probably search for that next time.

These are the bomb. I used turkey bacon for wrapping them though because it is already cooked. I also put a little bit of garlic pepper jelly on them before eating.

Add a package of mild or hot sausage to kick things up a notch!  Just brown it in a skillet, drain, and add it to the cream cheese.  Stir it up and then spoon it into the jalapenos.  These will all be gone in a matter of minutes, believe me it happens everytime.  I usually have to double or triple the recipe for bigger gatherings.  Enjoy!

Made these several times now, never any left over.  The thinner the bacon, the easier the wrapping and the more likely they'll stay wrapped on the grill.  Last time I made them with prosciutto and they turned out AWESOME.

I made then on the grill and in the oven, I think the oven is easier. I added a cap full of liquid smoke and some hot sauce to the cream cheese.
They are very addictive and go great with beer and football.

These were fantastic. I cooked them in the oven at 425* for 20 min. As I didn't have access to a grill. We loved them.

Maybe my peppers were too big bur it was way too much pepper and not enough cream cheese and bacon. May try it again, but make sure you use smaller peppers.

I have been making these with a mexican blend cheese and the oven (400 for 25 minutes) vice messing up my grill. I use a baking rack and dip them in a little brown sugar to help them caramelize.

This recipe is awsome! Try using some taco seasoning but not to much because the cream cheese turns an ugly brown.

Great flavor and perfect heat. I took off the top and cleaned out the inside leaving the jalapeno intact and then stuffed it with cream cheese. They turned out great on the grill and will definitely make them again.

This recipe is simple and great. We prefer more flavorful cream cheese and alot less heat. I add honey nut or pecan roasted and honey cream cheese. Also if you are entertaining people who do not like spicey food, devien and deseed, then soak in water for 2-3 hours. My 6 year old son loves these but if there is any bit of spice he will not eat them. You can also cook them in the oven at 375-400 for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Just be sure to have a catch pan so you do not smoke your kitchen up!

Mexican style.. I use the yellow chile peppers (same size as Jalapeños) not as hot! With fresh Mex. cheese or Panela Cheese. These type of cheeses gets soft without getting gooey..

A little fussy but 100% worth it. Not too expensive, and a very big hit at my friends party. Would have been easier to assemble in an assembly line style with extra hands helping, but otherwise uber easy. 
Baked on tin foil for easy clean up, the bacon grease made it easy to remove the poppers

What fun to make and a great hit! Although I wrapped the bacon super tight and tooth picked them good.  My son cooked them on the grill and said the bacon shrunk when cooked and the cheese came out the ends like a tube of toothpaste! :-) of course I has a ton of cream cheese in them too!  Also if you are going to do them, count how many slices of bacon you have and buy jalapenos to match! Yummsters!

This is one of the most popular appetizers I have made.  Very simple.....yet DELICIOUS!  After halving the jalapenos and cleaning out the seed and membranes I also boil them to take the heat down a notch.  It may be wise to open a window or otherwise the jalapeno fumes will get everyone in the house coughing.....LOL.    I wrap the bacon carefully around the entire jalapeno and secure with two toothpicks.  That way there is less leakage of the cream cheese.  I have also tried freezing the stuffed jalapenos briefly before cooking.  I have been broiling them and turning them frequently and have loved the outcome.  Very addictive appetizer!

Here's another little secret - roll them in brown sugar.  I add a little bit of regular (finely) shredded cheese and seasoning to the cream cheese also.  One of my favorite appetizers.

I do this quite often for parties.  Also, I make ahead for camping.  You can put them in the sandwich makers and put over the fire but you have to watch very carefully.  If the fire is too hot they will burn because you cannot flip them or the cheese will melt out.  I also add shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture of cream cheese.  A friend has a cheese ball recipe which she suggested using that as the filling.  I will try that next.

I made these ahead of time and popped them into my new panini grill when it was time. I pre-cooked the jalapenos for 6 minutes as recommended, and also cooked my thick sliced bacon for two minutes in the microwave prior to wrapping also. I like my bacon crisp, so would cook it on a bit lower heat for longer time next, but otherwise this is yummy!

With a bumper crop of peppers this summer I decided to experiment and make these with some of the reviewers recommendations. Boiling the jalapeno halves in water for was necessary. I went the full six minutes and they were perfect. I flavored the cream cheese on some, not on others... not sure it made that much difference because the bacon and pepper and barbecue flavor are so dominate. I only needed a half a piece of bacon - probably because they were soft coming out of the water and wrapped easily. I put them in the freezer for nearly a half an hour and didn't need a tooth pick to hold them together. We used an indirect heat on the grill but it was VERY hot. The bacon crisped up perfectly.  We also tried the peanut butter stuffing. I thought it was a fun change but my husband loved the cream cheeses version much better. So easy. Can be made up in advanced and cooked ahead of the rest of the food on the grill.

Huge hit! MAKE SURE YOU WEAR GLOVES! I have made that mistake in the past.. I saw that other people put the assembled peppers in the freezer for a few minutes I had forgotten that step but mine didn't ooze out hardly at all and this was my first time making them! I also put them in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes or so.. I did find it a little difficult to get all the seeds out (make sure you do it over the trash can!) but this is something I will make for every party we have.

We tried this as a snack my boys and I since we like Jalapeno's.  This was awesome.  We used Turkey bacon and they tasted great.  We ate them right off the grill they were not spicy at all even though we like spicy.  Great recipe.  Thank you for the fun we will be making this again.

I do not own a grill so I pre-"grilled" the sliced Jalepeno's on my Foreman grill. I also pre-cooked the bacon (halfway) in the oven to cook off some of the fat (grease.) I used whipped cream cheese and I added a tablespoon of Sriracha to the cream cheese. I used tooth picks to help hold together and baked at 350 for 18 min. So goooooooooooddddddd!!!!!!

This is a great appetizer!  Very filling, usually can only eat one at most two and these are either half or quarter of the pepper depending on size. Others have suggested to put pepper along with the cream cheese in freezer to help prevent melting while cooking.  Great idea.  I put these on grill to crisp bacon quickly, then if bacon is too thick, will put on bacon microwave plate to finish off the bacon.  Everyone likes these!

Absolutely loved this! Made these for my boyfriend and some of his guy friends one night when they were all over watching a game. It was a big hit! I used jalapenos that I grew myself, and baked them rather than grilling them. Made a great man-pleasing snack that was quick and easy. They were also good heated up the next day when I took the leftovers to work!

I went back and forth on if I should add the ranch seasoning to the cream cheese as others suggested - glad I decided against it, bc these were amazing as is!  I used neufchatel (low fat) cream cheese and center cut bacon.  Major hit w/ the guys!!

These were delicious!  I made these exactly as the recipe called for and without reading other ratings. I was concerned the cream cheese would melt out before they were done but surprisingly it didn't.  Next time I might leave in a few of the seeds to add an extra kick... I've always heard the heat is in the seeds but I learned that is a literal statement!  Still great!

They were quick and easy to prep (next time I'll wear gloves). I used small jalapenos (2"-3") so you could pop the whole thing in your mouth. I've had these before at a party, but they were lacked any kick.  I made these with jalapenos fresh from the garden. Mmmm, mmmm! They had a lot more punch! Will definitely be making this a staple at barbeques!

The Grilled Bacon Jalapeno Wraps were really good and a big hit at the family get together I had. Sometimes they tended to stick to the grilled but other than that they were amazingly good.

Fantastic recipe - great blend of flavors.  Took longer than 10 minutes on the grill though.  Also for those non-jalapeno lovers - I used a yellow bell pepper for those guests and they loved it just as much!

These are awesome!  I made these tonight when I got home from church.  Didn't want to fire up the grill so I made them on my George Foreman Grill.  If you let them get good and black and crisp, they are so sweet!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe, will make it again.  But, here's what I did wrong this time--the peppers I bought happened to be unusually large, and half a strip of bacon was not enough, and a whole strip was too much to brown easily. I'll get smaller perppers next time.

Came out great! People kept stealing them off the grill. You might want to stick them in the freezer for a few minutes so the cheese will harden otherwise it melts off

Great dish for football tailgates!  2 quick additions that make it even better include mixing in Sharp Cheddar cheese into the cream cheese, and then topping the mix with Paprika before wrapping it in bacon before proceeding as directed in the menu.  Gets rave reviews from everyone who tries them! Keep the seeds in as well if you wish to add spice.

I'd give it 5 stars but, to no fault of the recipe in iteself, a lot of the cream cheese leaked out and I found that it took quite a good while to cook since you cannot really put them on the lower rack without the bacon grease catching fire. I used the same recipe but I started to put them in the oven to avoid the above issues.

These are not bad. The way I make them I fry a pound of sausage and mix with the cream cheese. I hadnt tried the grill before, I usuall bake for 35-45 minutes at 350. So far these are amazing no matter how you make them!!!!

I do these like the other reviewer. Half cream cheese and half shredded. The thicker bacon works better too.

Delicious!  Like some other folks, I left the jalepeno whole and added cream cheese, shredded cheese with garlic powder and pepper.  I also blanched mine.  Everyone gobbled them up.

If no one has said it before, I'll say it now.  To save yourself a lot of pain, seed with gloves on!  I use inexpensive powder free gloves.  Easy peasy.

4+.These are great. I have used a mixture of one pound spicy sausage, 1 cup grated parmesan cheese, and 8 oz. cream cheese in the peppers. Then wrapped with the bacon. I have just baked them in the oven at 350 for about 30 minustes. UMMM!

I have tried these and they are always a HUGE hit!  To add a little something to it I use pineapple cream cheese and it is fantastic.  Gives you a little bit of salty, sweet, and spicy!

My family absolutely loves these.  Depending on the size of the pepper we might use 1/2 slice of bacon. They are delicious.  We are big football fans and my children ask for these every game day!

this is a great recipe with fresh jalepeno's,  takes most of the heat out when they cook.  Goes great with your favorite cerveza.  5 stars all the way!  Just Don't rub your eyes when you are doing it and remeber soap and water when you are done to get the pepper oil off!

A big winner @ our Thanksgiving neighborhood "get together". Grilling takes the edge off of the jalapenos. I did crisp the bacon under the broiler for about 2 minutes.

Great idea! Not at all hot unless a seed or two is left behind. I used soft goat cheese instead. The second time I made them my wife added sundried tomatoes before the bacon wrap. I'll do this again as a very inexpensive game day alternative to potato chips!

Love this recipe very much. It's always a favorite at our tailgates. The only thing I do different is add 4 ounces of sour cream to the cream cheese.

Yum, yum and yum.  

Only thing I did differently was partially freeze before grilling or brioling to help keep the cream cheese intact.

Have prepared these several times and since I have SO many types of peppers experimented with Banana and Poblanos.  Those were a bit more difficult to wrap with bacon due to the shapes, but still amazing.

I am making a hoard of these to freeze and enjoy over the winter months since I've such a bumper crop of peppers.  This is a wonderful treat for those of us who LOVE hot food.

Will be sure to attempt some of the variations I'm seeing here.

These were delicious. I made them for my boyfriend for Sunday football. Needless to say, he loved them! I used half slices of bacon, cooked them on the stove, and used toothpicks to keep them from unraveling. Great recipe!

These were fantastic!!  I made them last night for a football party and within minutes they were gone!  People who don't like the "burn" of jalepeno's ate them!  I took several reviews into consideration and soaked the jalepeno's in cold ice water for 15 mins to take out some of the hot.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and mixed some creole seasoning into the cream cheese.  I added the cheese mixture to the halved jalepeno's and wrapped them in bacon.  Depending on size of the peppers, I used either a whole piece or half piece of bacon and used a toothpick to secure.  I then put grated parmesan cheese on them, put them in the refrigarator for 20 mins to firm the cheese back up.  Grilled them until bacon was crispy and added more parmesan cheese.  Next time, I'll try some parm/romano cheese...

Made this for dinner tonight and was a little nervous because it was my first time trying it, but it turned out to be a hit! I used smoked bacon and it gave it extra flavor (because the cream cheese filling can be quite bland), but the jalapeño, cream cheese, and smoked bacon perfectly complimented each other. I am so excited to have discovered this recipe because it's so easy and yummy!

These were wonderful.  I made sure the edges met exactly after I filled them with cheese and before I wrapped them with bacon.  Used a fairly meaty bacon that was thinly sliced.  Used jalapenos that were about 2-3 inches long.   They did not ooze and did not burn.  They were not "hot" until you reached near the stem.  I would not bother freezing as mine didn't ooze.   10 stars!

These are delicious! My variation on this is to add a little cooked sausage (drained), little parmesan & shredded mozzarella to the cream cheese!Adds flavor & stretches the amount of filling!

Hint: wear gloves when taking out seeds and membranes. After cream cheese we add a half or whole lil' smokie then put the other half of jalapeno on top then wrap in bacon (half piece works) then hold together with rounded toothpick. To prevent  burning on grill just use a disposable aluminum pan! These are so good!

I had high hopes for these. I had made them with a little worchestershire sauce in the cream cheese. And cooked them on the grill (after freezing them slightly). They did not hold together well on the grill and cream cheese melted out. Taste was so-so. I doubt I will make them again.

DELICIOUS !!! I baked the peppers, elevated, in the oven, and substituted cheddar cheese.  Everything is better with bacon on it.  I was surprised how mild cool the fully cooked pepper tasted.

These were perfect! The only thing I changed was that I used a whole slice of bacon. This kept all the cheese in while on the grill and added flavor. I guess some don't like too much heat, but at my house I almost always serve spicy food, so this recipe was on the mild side compared to the rest of my food.  If I change anything if the future I will experiment with fresh herbs in the cream cheese.  Everyone loved them and will definitely make them again. 5 Stars!

The taste was very good. I did take suggestions of others and added garlic and the shredded cheese! I placed them on a rack inside of the pan so they would not be cooking in the oil from the bacon!! I made them for a family get-together and stashed some for home!!

I dont usually leave the stems on these but it seems like a good idea. I personally like the maple bacon for doing the armadillo wraps it seems to give a extra yummy factor

I was actually making this far before I saw it on this site but I wanted to put my version out there because it is very yummy. I use cream cheese and mix in diced pineapple (you could also use the pre made pineapple cream cheese but I like adding my own so I can control how much goes in.....I like lots of it) I also mix in some fresh cilantro if I have it available.......there is never any left on the plate.

It's hard to tell if they're tears of joy or jalapeños. The cream cheese will cool off your tongue, and you get a lot of texture with this fast-to-make appetizer. They're the more attractive, more interesting member of the veggies + dip family.

Changes I made: used turkey bacon and fat free cream cheese to lower the calories and fat. Then I can eat more of them.

I make these all the time. Make sure you boil the jalapenos in water for about 8 minutes before you stuff them. they won't be too hot that way. Also I like to mix crab meat with the cream cheese and I like to season the bacon with a little garlic salt. I love making and eating them.

This is the first recipe I have rated on here and all I can say is WOW! What a hit! All of my family loved them, I will definitely be making them again! I tried them using the dry ranch dressing mix with the cream cheese this time and will try with the cajun or worchestershire and garlic ideas next, can't wait! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!

I have been making a similar recipe for quite some time now and it is always a big hit. However I add a cooked shrimp inside and wrap in prosciutto. They can be grilled or baked, Yum!

This is THE BEST appetizer ever, I've made this at least 20 times this summer with my garden jalapenos. I make them by the dozens and they are gone in minutes for the whole family! We even put them in the oven covered with alum foil in the winter months :)

These are sooo good.  I make much more because they go very fast.  I also use turkey bacon because it is not so fatty and it is tastier than regular bacon!

I do all these steps but to add some sweet to the recipe i mix in a different bowl chili power and brown sugar.  Then i roll the finished Jalapeno wraps in the sugar mixture.  Make sure you make a lot because they go fast!

Awesome!  Not too spicy if you get all the seeds out - just a little bite which the cream cheese mutes.  Huge hit, even with people who don't like jalapenos!

These are really good.  I made them for a taigate yesterday and they were gone almost immediately.  Even enjoyed by one fellow who dosen't "do cream cheese."  The regular grilled jalapenos were left behind.  Next time I'm going to mix in some seasoning to add a little more to the great taste.

These are fantastic, to cut down on the heat of Jalapeno I broil them on high for 1 or 2 minutes first, then stuff them with goats cheese, wrap them in half the bacon, place them back under the broiler until they start to sizzle... less calories and every bit as delicious...  I have also had them with a light tomatoe sauce also excellent...

I love these! I stick them under the broiler on low for about 10-15 minutes. Gloves are a MUST! I haven't tried soaking them for long enough to take out the punch, but I will definitely try next time.

The husband absolutely loved these..since I am not a bbq pit savvy person I went with the oven recipe and grabbed a can of whole jello-pinos(how I pronounce them) and followed the rest of the recipe..I scored BIG TIME with my hubby with these, he even clapped his hands and gave me a standing ovation!

411- If you like HOT HOT leave the seedlings in..but if your a sissy like me TAKE them OUT! Either way they r enjoyable and you may need to make double the recipe!!

My family has been making these peppers for years! We always add some shredded cheddar to the cream cheese mixture. In my experience I've learned the bigger the pepper the less heat it packs, which I prefer! Also, these peppers can be cooked in the oven. I like my peppers to be tender, so I cook them for about 35-40 min @ 350.

Unbelievable! I also added ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese. I cooked in the oven until the bacon was super crispy and they turned about so delicious. They were gobbled up in two minutes.

If you do not like the heat, try stuffing Banana Peppers instead. Works just as good.

We do these in the oven on a regular basis, calling them Gator Eggs (no idea why!!!)  If you use slice the pepper in half lengthwise, then use a spoon to scrape out the insides---the seeds and membranes, it is much easier than a knife.  Removing them will ease the heat of the pepper, but so will cooking it long enough, you have to cook them long enough to allow the pepper to release it's oils.....then they are mild as can be!  You get the jalapeno taste without the heat. 
If I tried making them using only 6 peppers, I would get run out of town, we make them by the dozens!!!

I have made these like others, in a different version, one tip for those who do not or can not tolerate HOT items: After you cut the jalapeno in half and take the seeds out, soak them in 7-Up for a while. It takes the hot out of the jalapeno... Some might still have a little kick to them, others will not all depends on the jalapeno.

These are delicious! I make them with the yellow jalapenos for a sweet but spicy twist and I use onion and chive cream cheese to give it a little flavor boost. I totally recommend these poppers for parties:)

Theses are great! Otherwise known in the BBQ world as ABT's (atomic buffalo turds). They are best cooked low and slow over indirect heat for about 2 hours w some hickory smoke for added flavor.

My boyfriends makes these all the time. He does it a little different though. He slices the jalapenos but not completly apart. Just enough to stuff them and close them back up. He puts cheddar cheese in them puts a thin layer of jimmy dean sausage around the whole jalapeno and then wraps the bacon. Its amazing every time.

good recipe.  I have my own that is good as well.  Substitute the cream cheese for a slice of sharp cheddar.  Just slice a small piece that will fit inside the jalapeno.  Lower the heat to medium or the cheese will melt quicker than the bacon cooks.  Just cook it medium heat until bacon is done.

Wow...these have have an wonderful flavor.  The grilling and the bacon are delicious.  The are very warm.  Gloves would have been a good idea.  An soaking them in milk will remove the heat from the Jalapeno, I have heard.

So tasty!  Kinda spicy so be careful if serving to a pick group of people.  Next time I may boil the jalapeos first to take away some heat.  I loved them though the heat was fine for me.

They do not stay around very long.  Instead of bacon I mix sausage in with the cream cheese and then grill them until done.  Makes a great snack.

I make something very similar to this only I use shredded cheddar or other cheese and I cook them low and slow for a couple of hours on a vertical charcoal smoker.  Gets everything nice and smoky to go with the subtle heat, the crispiness of the bacon, and the melted cheese inside.  In the smoker community these are known as atomic buffalo turds (ABT's).  Absolutely love every version of these things I've had.

We do these with boneless chicken breast that we marinate in zesty italian dressing! Just cut to fit and wrap with bacon. I have found on a gas grill that I do them on indirect heat, no flare ups! But I start with a very hot grill.

We love making these when we cook out.  I like to add ranch dressing mix with the cream cheese gives it a better flavor.  For a sweeter version we have added the ranch dressing mix and some crushed pineapple.  These are a big hit with the kiddos.

This recipe inspires some great variations - my favorite is substituting crabmeat for the cream cheese and prosciutto for the bacon (it's hard to get the bacon cooked without making the jalapenos mushy)

One of our favorites! Another variation is to use Garden Veggie Creme Cheese and precook the bacon and crumble up into the cheese. These helps keep the flames to a minimum! Yum!

So simple, full of flavor.  Cooked them on a charcoal grill which added a great smokey flavor.  I was super short on bacon when I made these and actually cut my bacon slices in quarters to make it stretch.  Still tasted great and I think that using a full piece of bacon per half of jalapeno might be "too much."  Will be making these again!

Made these on the charcoal grill...so good! Did not soak them before hand, but still were perfectly mild with a little kick. I'll definitely make these again...and I'd like to try the ranch and cajun seasoning suggestions.

These are amazing!  I have made them SEVERAL times!  I do not grill them.  I bake them in a 375 oven for about 30-40 minutes.  I've used cream cheese and block cheddar cheese.  Cream cheese is better and I LOVE the crunchy greasy goodness that oozes onto the pan!  Fabulous recipe and ALWAYS a hit!

I tailgate for college football games and like different items than burgers and brats. I thought these were fantastic I added just a touch of cayenne to the cream cheese. The only suggestion I have is let the cream cheese soften enough to spread easy and let grill at a low temp to let the peppers soften then bump it up so that the bacon crisps and it is to die for!

I've been making these for years, very popular. Only I use Westfalian ham (prosicutto works, too) as there is much less fat plus I shorten the baking time or the ham dries out too quickly. I've also had success using turkey bacon. These are a hit every time!

These are my favorite appetizers and I always make them for my guests. I prefer to use the sweet mini bell peppers rather than the jalapenos. I usually cook them on the grill, but am going to try the oven method next time.

I have been making these little gems for a few years, and they are always a big hit. I agree with others that 1/2 a slice of bacon works well. Haven't tried seasoning the cream cheese, but will next time. Yes, remember to use gloves when touching the peppers!!!

These were great! I've been wanting to try them for a long time, but nobody in my family has ever been interested.  The other night when we had "breakfast for dinner" I picked one jalapeno from my garden and made myself two poppers to go along with my scrambled eggs - I broiled them in the oven since it was raining outside.  One of these with a spoonful of eggs folded in a piece of toast...YUM!!!!

I have made these many many times and each time more people love them! i do however make a few changes. I triple boil the jalapeno's. they still have a zip that way just lighter. I also mix my cream cheese mixture with shredded cheese, parm. cheese and a variety of spices. I also add a bit of soy sauce and lemon juice to the mixture. These are amazing and i have never had one complaint!

These work best if bacon has been cooked for a few minutes prior to wrapping the stuffed jalapeno, reduces the time and cheese does not melt away. We make these all the time but bake them, great idea to grill.

These are wonderful!!  They go well with any meal.  I personally like a little less cream cheese, but my boyfriend likes extra so it works out perfectly!

yum! I've been trying various recipes and although the bacon makes this one untraditional, it was quite a hit with my family.

These are awesome, however, as with most things I made some changes.  I thought just cream cheese would be bland so I added about 1 1/2 tbs. of McCormick's Grill Mates Cinnamon Chipotle seasoning and probably 1/4 c. of shredded sharp cheese.  They were wonderful!!  Definitely a keeper!!

So delicious - I was actually thanked for bringing these to a Super Bowl party!  Half were prepared as written, and I added worcestershire sauce and garlic powder (just a bit) to the cream cheese in the other half.  Both were delicious, but my personal preference is on beefing up the worcestershire and garlic.  Either way, these aren't your ordinary Jalapeno Poppers - the bacon adds depth and makes them addictive.  Seriously, people were standing there eating one after the other - glad I quadrupled the recipe!

Didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped. Maybe the bacon I bought was too thick. . . seemed undercooked after suggested time. Easy to make.

Be sure to de-seed your jalapenos before filling them with cream cheese! These are simple as heck, and a huge crowd-pleaser! So tasty and addictive - Every time I make them I eat one too many! I broiled mine in my oven seeing as I have no grill & it was wintertime. These are highly recommended and so easy to make!

These are amazing. I had them at a superbowl party and decided to make them for a party I was attending. I followed the recipe but I baked them instead, and they still turned out great. They came out quite greasy from the bacon though, but I'll bake them differently next time.

We used this to finish up the garden jalepenos.  It's a good recipe, but the peppers were still really HOT; I think I would roast them on the grill first, then stuff with cream cheese, wrap in bacon, and roast on grill or in oven.

You can do these in the oven at 425 degrees but be sure to use turkey bacon so the grease doesn't splatter.  These are always a hit at any gathering.

I added a little shredded cheese (combo of cheddar, mozza & jalapeno jack) with the cream cheese. Awesome! You definitely need to use two pieces of bacon per pepper: I used one per pepper, trying to reduce the amount of fat, but you need the two slices to cover the pepper.

My son made these last night.  He didn't seed them.  He spread cream cheese on them, wrapped in bacon and put them on the grill.  I was afraid to eat them with the seeds, but ended up eating 4 of them myself.  They weren't as hot as I thought they would be.  Another good way to eat these is to slice and seed them and put peanut butter inside of them.  Believe me that's also very good.  You don't have to bake or grill them.  The bacon wrapped ones are still the best.

I made these for our boxing day lunch and they were a hit!  I used 12 peppers (24 halves) with only one package of cream cheese and had lots of filling!  I split the cream cheese in half, left one half plain, and added the membranes and seeds from 6 jalapenos (all chopped up) to the other half.  Some of the people in our family LOVE hot stuff, others of us not so much.  We wrapped them in bacon, secured them with a toothpick, and made sure to cook the "hot" separate from the "not".  We cooked them in the oven on a foil lined sheet with sides til the bacon was cooked and then watched them disappear off the trays!  Excellent recipe.  Sooo simple!

very, very good! they got rave reviews. to cut the heat i removed the seeds and membranes then boiled the halves for 5 minutes. all that lowered the heat TOO much. i blended Ranch dressing mix into onion and chive flavored cream cheese and that worked well. i forgot to chill them so the cheese wouldn't melt and run out but the cheese was straight from the fridge so it wasn't too bad. they're a pain to make but worth the effort.

I actually get cravings for these things. They are wonderful! How can something so simple taste so good? I've done them under the broiler when we didn't want to start up the grill. Of course, the grilling adds that smoky flavor that is just awesome, but both are good. If you chill them again after they are wrapped and then start grilling the cut side first, the cream cheese is less likely to ooze out.

These are awesome!  Try using pineapple cream cheese instead of plain.  The jalapeno and pineapple along with the bacon work great together.

I use the ice water overnight, stuff them, and once I turn them on the grill, I brush them with BBQ sauce.  My husband had been missing out until I did that.  He didn't believe me that they weren't spicy.  And anything with BBQ sauce is a winner.  Now I just wish I'd made more!

I took these to a tailgate party and they were a hit. I didn't care for them myself because it's hard to get the bacon done on both sides without the cheese trying to run out. But other than that they were really easy to make and good butI highly suggest you wear gloves messing w/ the jalepenos.

This was great - pre-cooked my bacon in the microwave for a couple of minutes so the bacon was crisp - otherwise recipe was as written. Only problem is that I did not make enough.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Got only rave reviews when I made them...I also mixed in shredded sharp cheddar with the cream cheese. Still trying to find an optimal oven temperature though...i baked them at 350F for 40 min and while the bacon came out nicely the bottoms of the jalapenos were burnt.

These were awesome!!!  I added some cheddar cheese to the cream cheese and refrigerated for 3 hours to get the filling nice and cold.  I seared them  with the BBQ on (have the squirt bottle handy!!) then moved them to one side and finished them with indirect heat.  We could not believe how well the cheese stayed in!!  Thanks for a great recipe--so easy-will definitely make again!!

These are awesome!
couple things....
those that said to wear gloves were not joking i tried just washing my hands alot while preparing them and my hands are still burning.

I also boiled the peppers prior to grilling to soften them and they came out really limp, but still really good. I am making them again and i am not boiling them to see the difference. I did freeze them so cheese would not ooze and i did not put bacon on all of them and those were yummy also.

great snack for football- thanks

I love this recipe. I browned a pound of grounded pork sausage, and melted the cream cheese in it. Then I stuffed the deseeded pepper and wrapped it with as much bacon as needed (one or two slices). I also used the oven instead of the grill. MMMM MMMM very tasty!

I thought these were excellent.  I needed more peppers than called for and I did add some dry ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese. Lots of reviews said to use a whole slice of bacon, however, we only used half slice and found that to be very satisfactory.

I thought these were good, but not spectacular. I used chive and onion cream cheese with a little bit of shredded cheddar mixed in. I will definitely make them again, but I won't grill them. Much, much easier just to pop them in the oven. I will also doctor up the filling. Maybe add some canned chili's and garlic powder.

I have made these on my own and didn't know there was recipe.  But, I stretch the bacon end to end and around to cover entire jalapeno so the cheese won't seep out as bad.  Also, best sauce in world to dip is Smuckers Strawberry Preserves (I use less sugar one) and heat up in micro.  It's a sweet/hot/salty mix and delicious!

Easy to make.  Just make your grill is really hot.  So the bacon cooks fast enough and the cream cheese won't soften to much.

very good!  thanks for the recipe.  i made sure to get all the seeds out cos i dont care for "too hot", but i didnt get all the membranes out at the narrow ends and they definitely had heat.  i got pretty decent size jalapenos so for most of them i had to wrap 2 slices of bacon around...and it wasnt too much!  very easy and good.  oh, and one more suggestion to those who arent jalapeno conessieurs - wear gloves when dealing with these!!

These were great. The assembly was messy but fun! I put a piece of non stick aluminum foil on the grill so it could catch all the grease.

HOT! I used a variety of spicy red, orange and green peppers for this recipe including jalapenos. I took the advice of other users and added some grated cheddar along with some granulated garlic. Slit the peppers down one side and use the tip of a sharp knife to clean out the seeds and ribs of the peppers. Wooded skewers were perfect for keeping the bacon securely wrapped. They cooked easily on the gas grill and were enjoyed by my family. I recommend using surgical gloves while working with peppers to avoid having any of the burning pepper on your hands afterward.

Okay, the only reason this didn't get five stars was because it really was labor-intensive.  These seemed like the perfect appetizer for my dh's "fantasy football" draft with his buddies.  I wanted to leave the jalapenos whole, so making a slit in the side to remove the seeds wasn't very easy.  I took the suggestion and added garlic powder and bit of worcestershire sauce to the cream cheese.  Cooked them on the grill.  Long story short, there are no leftovers.  One guy said "I've never had those specific flavors combined in my mouth before, and I love it!"  So I guess I'll be making these again.  But if anyone has any easy suggestions on how to de-seed those suckers, I would really appreciate it.

YUM!  I added shredded cheddar to the cream cheese as others had suggested. First try I used jalapenos.  Today I made them with mild green chiles.  Next time I will try making them with fat free cheeses and turkey bacon for my dieting friend.  Thank you for a great recipe!

These are excellent, I first made them in a dutch oven cooking class. They are simple and delicious! We like ours with a tiny bit of pineapple on top (added after cooking) it compliments the salty flavor of the bacon and the spicy pepper PERFECTLY! Try it!

My wife and I do them this way all the time we have found that one of the best ways is to cut the bacon in half and use the whole peace to wrap it in by crossing the bacon so that it seals the whole thing.  Also some of the cheap bacon tends to be so thin that it leaves holes in outer shell and the cream cheese tends to leak out.  I believe far better than store bought Jalapeno poppers.

These are awesome! I mix in some minced garlic, garlic powder, chili powder and a handful of shredded cheddar cheese into the cream cheese mix with a dash of sea salt. Also use turkey bacon and low-fat cream cheese. Keeps them a bit healthier and lowers the chance of grill flame ups from the bacon grease. Huge summer party hit!

Made these several times always the first thing to run out!! Never had a complaint! I like to mix in a cup of shredded mexican cheese blend to the cream cheese before I stuff just for  added cheesieness. It is great without though! Also one time forgot the toothpicks and used spaghetti noodles and that makes the entire thing 100% edible!

Everyone LOVED these! I followed others and put them in the freezer for about 15-20 mins before baking them. My group is all on diets so I used fat free cream cheese and turkey bacon. You couldn't tell! They were amazing!!

We started our first garden this year and grew our own jalapenos. My husband found this recipe and tried it. It was a hit! You do need to put them in the refrigerator like some of the other reviews say to do. It does keep the cheese from melting out.

Since I don't like spicy food, I used small sweet peppers and it turned out great.

Great recipe. It doesn't need anything extra. I added some cheddar cheese to half of my peppers and left the other half exactly as the recipe is written and they were equally great. This was easy. I was a little worried because my husband is a little "wimpy" when it comes to spice, so I took out all of the seeds. But it was very mild so the next time I'll leave more of the membranes and seeds for more heat.

We read a ton of reviews and decided on this recipe with the ranch seasoning in the cream cheese. We loved it! (My only suggestion would be to try to keep the membrane out of your eyes!- oops!)

Every time I take these to party they are gone before the plate hits the table.  We either grill them or cook them in a hot oven for about 20 min.  Sprinkle a little garlic powder for a bit of extra flavor.  MMMMMMM!!!  I think I'm going to make a batch now!!

This was a great appetizer at our party.  I followed another reviewers instructions to put them in the oven, but I image they're even better grilled.

Made these for Super Bowl.  By happenstance, I put them on the grill and they took off on fire within 2 min., grabbed them off of there and threw them into the oven on a baking sheet. Greasy.  Drained the grease and broiled them.  Next time, I might put them on the grill for a few minutes to get the smoky flavor, but definately would use a broiler pan and rack so the grease can drain. I like spicy food, but not very. These were just so-so in the heat level.  Next time I will leave more membrane.

These are a hit everytime, very greasy but worth it. I baked mine in the over and they were just as good. I still have people comment on how good these were days after.

Fantastic recipe. I don't like hot foods but the cream cheese tempers the heat very well, especially if you remove all of the white inner ribs of the peppers where much of the heat is found. We lay the bacon across the top of the pepper instead of wrapping in around and it's less messy.

This is a good recipe but I suggest adding salt to the jalapeno and refrigerate over night so that the peppers won't be so bland--but of course it all depends on the type of bacon that is used.  I don't like salty bacon.  I cooked these in the oven but next time I'm going to fry them and to add more flavor, mix the cream cheese with ranch flavor.

These are GREAT and pretty simple to make. I have used cheddar cheese also and it is really good. I found, also, that 1/2 a slice of bacon is plenty per pepper and cooking in the oven is much easier.

Oh these are to die for. I found that the smaller peppers worked the best (about 3 inches long) because the bigger, fatter ones flattened out during cooking and made the bacon come apart (of course, I'm sure a toothpick would rectify this situation but I didn't bother with toothpicks). Also 1/2 a strip of bacon was sufficient for each pepper, and I was able to assemble 80 pieces (yes, we were having a party!) with only two boxes of cream cheese, so I don't think so much is needed. I baked them at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and they came out perfectly.

Easy, delicious and my wife LOVES these appetizers.  I used Velveeta rather than cream cheese and added thawed shrimp to the middle of the wrap.  It was much larger with the shrimp and most of the cheese melted out of the wrap and down into the grill.  Perhaps cream cheese wouldn't melt so much.  Either way, good stuff!

I have been making these for year!!! YUMMY I do scrape the veins really good and make sure there are no seeds in sight.  I also don't use so much bacon, just a small strip around the middle and secure with a toothpick and into the oven they go~on a stone~the grill is too much work for me.  thanks for posting!

Made these last night and they were awesome!!  It was raining so instead of barbecuing I put them under the broiler.
