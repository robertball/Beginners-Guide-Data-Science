Hi, this is Rachael.  I read some of the recent reviews and I feel that's it's unfair to poorly rate this recipe if you don't like the consistentcy of boiled peanuts! This isn't to make crunchy, roasted peanuts, its for soft, boiled peanuts!  For the rest of you, I am so THRILLED that ya'll have enjoyed this recipe!

This is just like Florida Peanuts :)  Heres a trick - to not have to waith the 24 hours, put the whole mix in a pressure cooker, cook for 45 minutes on medium high pressure.  Then, transfer to crock pot for 2 hours - you have your peanuts in 3 hours!  Thanks so much for this - my fam loves them

I am so happy I found this recipe!!! I recently moved to NY from FL, and needless to say there's more different than alike up here. I miss my spicy boiled peanuts from the roadside stand, and these are DYNO-MITE! The longer you let them sit on low in the crock pot, the better! I followed everything to a T, and I used the recipe on here for cajun seasoning (and had a little left over for the next batch!): 1 tablespoon salt  1-1/4 teaspoons dried oregano  1-1/4 teaspoons paprika  1-1/4 teaspoons cayenne pepper  1-1/4 teaspoons ground black pepper
EDIT: I made these for superbowl, and used sliced brined jalapenos and a bottle of beer and they were excellent!!!!!!!!

Here's another recipe that I wish I could give 6 stars to!  I live in Pensacola, FL and have eaten my fair share of roadside stand boiled peanuts.  I love them and these are some of the best I've ever had.  I didn't change a thing about the spice blend.  I love the fact that this recipe doesn't call for alot of salt compared to some other recipes.  You don't need it.  The spice  blend gives the peanuts tons of flavor.  If you are afraid of the heat, don't be.   These have a little kick, but they won't send you running for the milk jug.  It took about 26 hrs for mine to cook the way I like them.

I'm on board with Rachael (submitter of recipe)...if you don't know what "boiled peanuts" are all about, then don't submit a bad rating due to texture issues! I'm a northerner but have lived in the south and got hooked on these. I like this flavor way better then just plain salted ones. I used organic dry raw peanuts (2lbs) cuz when I got my craving, green peanuts weren't in season. I soaked my peanuts overnight in cold water (weighed em down w/a plate) drained, then proceeded with the recipe. I didn't use 'crab boil' - added some Old Bay. I also added a bottle of Honey Brown Ale initially and cooked in a 8QT heavy stock pot on the stove. If you store the pot in the fridge overnight (after cooking for 12 hrs) the peanuts tend to suck up more liquid and will finally sink down; then continue cooking next day. You have to sample one here n there until you get the texture you prefer. If you don't use green peanuts you may have to cook longer. If I had a pressure cooker I would try method mentioned. All I can say is if you want crunchy peanuts, don't try these or rate poorly because these are meant to be softish (like canned kidney beans). I like mine soft, but that's a personal pref. In any case, love the additional spice profile!

I had only tried boiled peanuts one time and decided to give these a shot. They turned out really good and were simple to throw together. The wait was hard but good things come to those that wait right? These ended up with just the right amount of spice and salt. Thanks for the great recipe!

We must have gone to the same peanut stand in Ocala because these taste exactly like the kind we had.  This is the first time I've ever made them and they turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe.

I personally am not a fan of boiled peanuts, but my husband is a fanatic! He asked me to make him some spicy ones. I followed this recipe exactly, except I cooked the much longer (my husband likes to eat the shells... yuck). He went on and on about how amazing they were and were the best he had ever had. He told me if I didn't get on here and leave a great rating and review then he would no longer love me the same way. :) Five thumbs up!

Couple changes: I didn't use as much salt, and substituted a "Soul Food" spice for the Cajun seasoning because I didn't have any. One thing: Be sure to wash the peanuts well by setting them in a colander in a bowl full of water. Shake the colander around until any bits like stones or torn-off shell cashings have settled to the bottom of bowl. Used Old Bay crab seasoning.

The best I've had in years. I lived in Pensacola, Fl for a few years. When I move I started making my own and have tried many reciepes. Usually they would turn out good, but not quite the same as I've had in FL. This resicpe has the taste and flavor I've been looking for. A real keeper. Thank's rachaelp

Holy boiled peanuts was this AMAZING!!!  I will never want to buy from the roadside guys again - haha! I am born and raised in FL and these turned out freaking awesome!  Just some of my own personal experiences:
*I only added about 1/4 cup of salt as I thought 1/2 cup would be too much but hubby said it needed more salt so he added that last 1/4 cup but that (to me) made it a bit too salty.
*We picked up the extra spicy crab boil - WOW was that spicy, LOL!! So if you like spicy but not TOO spicy then don't get the extra spicy.
*With the crockpot - we had it set on High for just about all 24hrs.  Right now it's set at Keep Warm until hubby gets home to enjoy them.  It seems like if it were set to low this whole time they may not be as soft as we like them. (Not mushy but seems like it may still have a little crunch.. if that makes sense.)

*And for the ones rating this recipe a 1 or 2 stars AND YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE BOILED PEANUTS then honestly what on earth are you even doing here??  Go play in the snow!! 
*Why on earth would anyone give this a low rating just because they don't know what to do with the crab boil bag??  If you do a simple Google search you would have read that you just place the bag into the water.
(Honestly, if y'all want a good laugh just read through these reviews!!)

This was our first attempt on making boiled peanuts at home and a big thank you to Rachael for making it a HUGE success!!!

Yes! I finally found a recipe for peanuts I used to eat all the time as a kid (yes, I've always liked food with a kick). This is a keeper! Beats regular "salt only" boiled peanuts any day.

I don't know how to rate these ... the flavour was great but soft peanuts? From what I've read, Southerners, who are raised with these, will like this recipe, but Northerners (like myself) who are used to crunchy peanuts likely will not. Sorry I can't rate this higher ... just personal preference I guess!

Maybe it's because I am not from Florida?...I don't know. The texture was not appealing. Would have rather just had normal peanuts.

Wow...love these!  Had a craving one day and was too lazy to go the store to buy peanuts or dry crab boil.  Instead, I used a bag of dried garbanzo beans and Zatarain's liquid crab and shrimp boil.  I know the garbanzo beans sound weird but they were good and best of all didn't have to peel them.  May cut down on the salt next time as they were a bit salty.

DEEEEEELICIOUS!!!!!!!  I am an Ohioan, currently living in Coastal Mississippi, and have become addicted to these things!  I made these for the first time this past weekend when two girlfriends came down to visit me, and they had never had them before.  They were hooked after one bite!  I like that I 'KNOW' how long they've been cooking, whereas the ones you can buy in those kettle cooker things in some stores down here, there's no way of telling how long those have been stewing, which perhaps is why sometimes they can be a bit too mushy.  These have just the right amount of give, and I cooked them on low for at least 24-30 hours, then turned the crockpot to 'warm' for the next 24 hours (just because I forgot to put them away), and the next day, I scooped them out and put them into a gallon-sized ziploc bag and stored them in the fridge.  That was 3 days ago, and I'm eating the last few today, with a little help from some co-workers.  wouldn't change a thing!!!!

I LOVE boiled peanuts, but have never tried making them myself!  These were so easy and wonderful!  The package of peanuts I bought were 1.5 lbs, but I kept the measurements the same as the recipe called for since I didn't know how spicy it would be and I knew my 6 yr old would want some too.  They still came out amazing!  Next time I will cut back a little on the salt, but other than that, I won't change a thing!  I cooked them on low for 21 hrs, and then turned it up to high for 2 more hours, and they were good after a total of 23 hours.  Some might have given it another hour, but I don't like them too soft.  Perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will be making these often!!

Great recipeA few things I do differently: 
1. I cut back on the on the jalapenos and pepper flakes a bit just cause I'm a wimp. But the seasoning overall is PERFECT. BONA FIDE Cajun boiled peanut flavor from a roadside stand in the panhandle!
2. I boil on HIGH (not low) for 24 hours. Even then they aren't soft enough for me (even if I use "green" peanuts). I let them cool off and just sit in the crock pot for another 24 hours. Then they became supremely awesome. 
3. After years of making these with regular raw peanuts, I finally got some green ones. They got soft faster, but you really can achieve the same taste with just a little longer in the pot if all you can get are raw. It wasn't worth how much trouble it is to procure green peanuts if you can't get them locally. 

Just FYI my picture is the close-up in a white cup. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

I've made this recipe and/or a modified version of it for some time and I really enjoy it.  However, one of the most important details about this recipe has been neglected.  The volume of the slow cooker, or rather, the volume of water added to peanuts is ultimately what affects how salty/spicy these peanuts become.  For example, if I add one gallon of water to this recipe the halved if I added, instead, two gallons of water... such that how salty the salt-water is would be the factor that affected how salty the peanuts were...

I had never eaten boiled peanuts before fixing these. After 36 hours in the slow cooker I couldn’t wait to try them! The only way I could describe them was like eating lima beans. Maybe with spices! I thought I have screwed the recipe up but after taking them to work and consulting with a guy from Florida he said, “Yelp, they are like that.” Recipe may on the money but I’ll not revisit this experience at home or on the roadside.

I'm making these as I write this review. Only gave it 3 stars cuz I'm a little confused!! First.....the recipe says to add water to KEEP PEANUTS COVERED.....the peanuts are floating!!!! How am I to keep them covered if they're floating? Maybe after it comes to a boil, they'll settle down!!??!! Second....recipe calls for Crab boil.....I bought Zantarain's.....It came in a porous (SP?) bag. Was'nt sure if I should have just thrown the bag and all in the pot or opened the bag and dumped the seasonings in......I opened the bag and dumped the seasoning in. I REALLY hope these come out the way I remember them from the roadside in Florida....LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them!!!! P.S.....they really smell good!!!!!!

Absolutely amazing!  My 11 year old and I could not stop eating them. Doubled recipe.  I used fresh picked peanuts, we live in peanut country. Cooked about 32 hours and stored in fridge overnight in cooking liquid!  So good. Will definitely make again!

These were really great! I followed the recipe to a T, and even my husband who didnt previously like boiled peanuts liked these. They were not super hot, but had a wonderful spicy/cajun flavor. I ended up letting them cook 26 hours, but the extra time didnt hurt them.

The recipe is very good, but I don't understand how to eat them (probably because I'm a Yankee)!  They're very slow to eat and messy.  Is the idea to prepare them for a crawfish boil or something?

My one passion in life is boiled peanuts! I grew up in peanut country (Dothan AL) so I have eaten boiled peanuts all my life. This was just ok for me. Not bad, but not great either.

I've made this about 3 times now.  I cut back on the red pepper flakes (used about 1/4 cup).  Zatarains crab boil is better than McCormick, in my opinion.  I did  not use the seeds or membranes from the jalapeños.  Mine take a little over 24 hours of cooking as I like my peanuts super soft.

LOVE this recipe! I don't like jalapeno in my peanuts, so I left those out -- that's the only thing I changed. I would never, ever have thought to add crab boil to the liquid, but I believe that's what gives the peanuts their distinctive boiled peanut flavor. This is just a perfect recipe, and I have shared it many times!.

These were very good. My boyfriend is crazy about them. My one regret is that I did not add all the jalapenos that the recipe called for. It actually could have been a little spicier. Next time I make these I will trust the recipie and put them all in.

I've made these a couple of times, and just noticed a photo of completed peanuts and a 'bag' of peanuts. I do hope folks know that 'green' peanuts are what you are suppose to use for this recipe. I'm cooking a batch now and can't wait for the outcome. Will update this review when they finish. Green peanuts are only available certain times of the year, so to get the reall effect you might want to make sure that is what you start with. I'd never eaten these till my Mississippi husband had to have some a few years ago. So I had to figure out how to prepare some for him. So far he loves this recipe every time!! Thanks!

Awesome!  I'd never made anything like these so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The whole family was pleasantly surprised.  I made a few minor changes... I used about 1/8 cup of the red pepper flakes and de-seeded the jalapenos because we don't like super-hot food.  They still came out plenty hot!!  I also was unable to find unsalted, raw, in-shell peanuts so I used the salted ones and rinsed them as well as omitted the salt.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

I use about 1/2 the salt and use the local fresh peanuts ready for boiling.  I keep it on low heat for 24hrs.  This recipe is excellent and we love it.

Spicy variation on traditional boiled peanuts.  Kicks it up nicely.   I agree with some of the reviewers that the recipe is too salty.  Next time I'll cut the salt to about 1/8th cup per pound and see how that turns out.  Instead of cooking overnight in a slow-cooker,  I cooked in a large pot on the stove at a simmer for twelve hours. The longer they cook, the better they get and the more juice is inside the shell, which I like.
Next time I will cut the salt, cook longer, and I anticipate this will be five stars.   Oh, don't cook just one pound, it won't be enough, these are too good!

Have these in the crock pot now. The wait is killing me!! I grew up in Georgia and have had lots of boiled peanuts and every time I go back I get some. Now I don't have to wait to head south to get them. Will update tomorrow after I actually taste them. But smells soo good

Used a little less salt, no jalapeños (didn't have any)! Used Old Bay, doubled garlic powder - and they turned out terrific. Will use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is enjoyable, however, I would add less red pepper. I found it to be pretty hot for my taste. I wanted more of the cajun flavor with mild heat, so if I make it again, I'll experiment with more crab boil and cajun seasoning and about a ? cup of red pepper flakes instead of a half cup. Other than that it's quite tasty, just not my favorite.

While the flavor was good,  I,  and the friends I  had try this, thought it was much too salty. I followed the recipe exactly. I've let it sit on warm in the crockpot after the 1 day of cooking on low and added more and more water to try to dilute it, it has made it a little better (i.e. less salty). 

Next batch, I'll cut the salt down by at least half. Don't think 1/2 cup salt is needed/should be used. Typo on the recipe or just large difference in saltiness preference?

I have made this recipe many times. We live in a beach town this is a great summer treat to eat on the beach or pool side. I have found 12 hours is enough. I always test one before I take the whole batch out.

We made this recipe and it is amazing! My dad is from Alabama and that is where we would always enjoy our boiled peanuts... my fiance and I now live in Colorado and they do not have this tasty treat. We added cayenne to make it more spicy... and I think next time we will add fresh garlic instead of powder. Another user said they used beer and that may be a good idea too... and maybe throw in some sausage too. Trust us... you will want to make more than just 1lb... because right when you're finishing the first batch you will wish you had more... but will have to wait another 24 hours... haha

First off I have never tried boiled peanuts or cooked them but the gal I'm dating is from Orlando and says they are her favorite thing to eat. Being the nice guy I am I searched everywhere for raw peanuts (whole foods, other organic stores) but here in Vegas found it to be impossible. Well finally I found them on amazon and will be getting my 4lb bag tomorrow. I'm really excited to try this out for her. She loves spicy food and I got all the ingredients to make this to a tee but if anyone has any recommendations on how I can make these taste like what she is used to I would be grateful. Lookin forward to tryin my first batch!

I will try it soon! I am from GA, but live in CO. We can't get raw peanuts here. I usually have to have my relatives ship them to me....and people look at me crosseyed when I say "boiled peanuts". However, everyone who's tried them has LOVED them and found them quite addicting.
I boil mine in a slowcooker too, but have to turn the heat up--the altitude here makes a huge difference. I am so glad to see something so loved in the heart of the south start rising to the surface!

Brilliant! From the west coast originally and lived in Florida for 7 years and I'm proud to say that these are just like the delicious goodness I got when I was there (only adding a full cup of serrano and jalapeños to change it because I like it stupid hot)... I'm happy to bring this to San Diego! Thank you! For those who dont like the texture and or saltiness... don't rate this poorly as you probably have no taste anyway :P

This was a good recipe but I must say, I would cut down on the spices next time.  I like hot and spicy but the older I get, the less it likes me.  ):  I thought the amount of salt would be over the top but it was perfect.  Thank you for sharing!

I thought they were very good.  Everyone enjoyed them at our Supper Club.  I cooked them for about 26 hours and let them sit and cool in the "brine" so they got even more flavor.  I will definitely make them again!

This was great recipe. The only reason I’m giving it four stars is because it’s way  too salty.  I used unsalted raw peanuts too and it still had an overpowering salt taste. I followed the directions step by step and the only thing I omitted was the jalapeños because they are too spicy for us. After letting them cook 25 hrs  I had to soak the peanuts in sugar water to counteract the salty taste. It left them with a sweet spicy taste instead. Still awesome but at the same time wasn’t what I was looking for.  Next time I will use half the salt and half the Cajun seasoning just because it was slightly spicy for me was well . They were really delicious though and I highly suggest trying this recipe if you love boiled peanuts.

I made these and tripled the recipe.  I used the raw peanuts in the shell and it took about 24 hours in the slow cooker.  I started them on high for about 20 hours and turned the cooker to low for the last few hours.  This is a fantastic recipe and the peanuts were perfectly seasoned.  But be sure to check your peanuts often during the first half of cooking time because the peanuts absorb almost ALL of the water during the 'rehydration period' of cooking.  I had to fill my cooker up three times with water.  Note:  I live in Georgia and we sometimes throw a ham hock into our boiled peanuts for extra flavor.

Winner, Winner chicken dinner!  I can't stop eating them.  So easy, and you can change it up to fit your taste.  
I'll never buy them in a can again.
Only bad thing is that I never thought to use a slow cooker, that's just brilliant. 
THANK YOU

This recipe is the best boiled peanuts I ever had!! I moved up north a few years ago and was shocked to find no one knew what boiled peanuts were! I found this recipe and made my own & Im in love. Everything is perfect the only thing I dont add is the garlic powder. Thank you Rachael! With this recipe I was able to bring this amazing comfort food straight to my kitchen (:

I have made this many times and many variations.  I am making a huge batch today to give as early xmass presents.  I am using a huge pot on top the stove closely watched.  Too many for the slow cooker.  I am from New England an these were new to me.  They are soft and delish.  Change up the seasonings..  I wonder....   Enjoy!

I love boiled peanuts.  The recipe as written is more salty than I'd prefer.  I've made it twice... once exactly as written, the second time I used more old bay and less salt.  The time needed to be extended a lot too.  The peanuts were too crunchy so I kept the slow cooker on overnight.  Overall I'd make this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe and so so easy! It took the full 24hrs ( of my kids asking repeatedly if they were done) to cook. The smell was amazing and everyone was so excited to try them! Boiled peanuts are not common in Louisville, KY so this was a real treat. They had a great spicy flavor ( even though I omitted the jalapeño because I didn’t have any on hand).

I made this over the weekend after I got a craving for some. As a Florida native I would first like to say thank you. These had the texture I was looking for. I would love to give this 5 stars but as several others have stated, the salt content was on the heavy side. I personally could see this using just the crab boil and a few tablespoons of salt if only making a pound. Overall I have used the same "juice" watered down immensely to create 5 pounds. Still, really good recipe!

Love the texture and heat, but much too salty for my taste.  Gonna cut back on the salt next time, but I plan on making these with some frequency.

I think this recipe would prob be perfect as written if you like heat.  I omitted the jalapeño, salt, garlic powder and red pepper just to keep it simpler (I prefer unsalted nuts in general).  I used liquid boil (following the instructions on the package). This recipe was an excellent starting point.  I was afraid to keep the slow cooker on overnight so they cooked for about 15 hours on low and then stayed in the brine in the fridge overnight.  Perfect for me.

Hands down-I WIN with this recipe!!! 
If you love Cajun style peanuts then you hit the jackpot with this recipe. I've made this recipe 4 times now and it keeps getting better! I do use about a tablespoon less salt and the same for the red chili flakes. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe all the way. But, I prefer just a touch less salt and heat. It's so tasty even when adjusted!

Good southern/Cajun boiled peanuts. Boiling in a slow cooker for 24 hours is key as well as using raw green peanuts, not just raw.

Just like the boiled peanuts at Owens fish camp in Sarasota.  I did not add the full amount of red pepper flakes or jalapeño and they still had a bite to them. Best eaten warm but still taste wonderful cold.

Used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.

Let mine go for 2 days and ate them all day and night both days.  Seems like 24 hours is fine enough.

Doing these out of shell next time for comparison, but the flavor is perfect.  Not as spicy as I expected!

I absolutely love Cajun boiled peanuts. One of my favorite 'cheat day' foods. This recipe isn't awful but it's not great either. For one it is way way way too salty. I would recommend cutting the amount of salt  in half. Also the flavor is just off. I am unsure why that is. Like I said it's not the worst recipe ever It just needs a good bit of tweaking.

Backed off the salt a tad due to the Cajun seasoning that is salty and the crab boil. Added 1-1/2 cup of sliced dill pickle with the brine.  I like spicy so I add cayenne pepper and also more red pepper flake and jalapeno to mine.. the secret if you cook boiled peanuts as much as me is PRESSURE COOKER!!!!! They are done and perfect in 4 hours.  Crock pot is normally 24 hrs.  ENJOY!!!

I 100% agree you shouldn't have been rated poorly because some genius didn't realize boiling peanuts made them soft, some people just have to be negative, something wrong with em. Great job on your recipe, Delicious I stuck to your recipe exactly. Another thing people, it takes a ton of salt to boil peanuts, this is common knowledge for Florida folk.. Quit complaining

So good. I am from the west coast and my husband took me to Florida to visit his family and told me I HAD to try boiled peanuts.. I was so confused.. Why would you boil a peanut?? I tried them and even though it wasn't at all what I was expecting, it was so good. I instantly became addicted. I'll admit I started having withdrawals as soon as I got home. I found this recipe and had doubts that they just wouldn't be the same... But they are! I have made this recipe many times now and even my west coast family can't get enough!! Props to you chef!!!!! And thank you for sharing the recipe!

Being a boiled peanut lover for many years, this is the best recipe I have ever made. Very easy. I followed the recipe all the way. The only thing I did different was cooked them for 26 hours versus 24.  Shared them with several different friends and they all wanted the recipe.

Recipe is closest to the real deal!  I try and get the real ones at road side stands when I travel through Ocala area on way to Gainesville to take in a Gator game each fall.  Since I live in Colorado now this recipe is perfect for anytime my wife and I get the craving for Cajun style boiled peanuts - excellent!

We had a rainy weekend here in Florida so I decided to try this recipe.  The flavor and heat were good, but the 1/2 Cup of salt made it WAY TOO SALTY!  I'll give it another try but will cut the salt by at least half next time.

I loved them!!! These were better than some of the peanuts you buy from the corner stores. Lol. I'm from south Fl and these were perfect. Now they were super hot. I've never had any this hot before so if you have sinuses or a stuffy nose, these will clear that right up. LOl. I made these for my parents without the jalapenos and they thought it was extremely salty. I didn't taste that the first time I made them but definitely the second time. I might either cut back or completely eliminate the salt next time but I still loved them!

My family and I just returned from Orange Beach, Alabama and every gas station we stopped at in the south had these cajun boiled peanuts in large crock pots. My husband and son fell in love with them so I had to try a recipe when I got home. I went with this one based on the reviews and I am so glad I did. They turned out EXACTLY like the ones they loved. I followed the recipe perfectly (even bought Zatarain's brand of crab boil) and I doubled the recipe. It just finished the 24 hours in the crock pot and we all just sampled them and oh my. They are so yummy. Perfectly seasoned. I had my doubts about that much salt but it definitely needed it and they aren't too salty at all. Give these a try if you love cajun boiled peanuts! I will be saving this recipe for sure.

This was great and I added 3 tbs of cajun seasoning since I didn't have crab boil and after cooking for 12 hours I added baby redskin potatoes,fresh mushrooms sliced,sweet green peppers sliced. I had boiled peanuts once while in Fl from a guy who added these veggies and was awesome. Thanks for the recipe!

I sure have....and it is easy, the ingredients are handy & if you crock pot it, you have an easy snack that everyone loves!  I followed the recipes from roadside vendors on my way to New Smyrna Beach, FL.  They are spicy & salty good!!  Don't pay for someone to make it.  Do it yourself!  My boiled peanuts are soooo good that I may try to sell them myself LOL

I made these last night.  I started them at 10pm and by 10am they were done.  I used my 6 quart crock pot for a pound and a half of nuts and a gallon of water.  I followed the directions and I added extra of the spices and jalapeno peppers for more heat.  I checked the water after a 1/4 cup salt and it was salty enough for me, as I am watching my sodium intake and I love salt. The water was extra spicy and burned my mouth in a good way.  The nuts have a nice flavor, but not hot and spicy at all.  I also used GREEN PEANUTS.  Will make these again.

We absolutely LOVE this recipe! The only problem was that we didn't cook enough and are making another batch now. We made a few changes….we left out the jalapeños, added some cayenne pepper, used 1/4 cup regular salt and 1/4 cup sea salt, and instead of regular crab boil I used Old Bay Blackened seasoning and some regular Old Bay. I let them soak in the seasoned water for about 3 hours before I put them in the crock pot. Also, it took about 36 hours to cook in our crock pot, not 24. They turned out incredible! Thanks for sharing!!

Being from Cali, I had never heard of boiled peanuts until I moved to the South. After trying from various locations, I am addicted and knew I needed to try this myself! Unfortunately, they are extremely salty and I believe that the boil I used (Louisiana Crab and shrimp boil) has an underlying clove flavor which I dislike. Next time I'll try less salt and Zatarain's, or my own if I can't find a clove free variety. Good base recipe though, thanks for sharing!

We were raised on boiled peanuts.  We used to have our family who live in Florida Fed Ex peanuts from their farm just so we could have boiled peanuts..  However, our family did them strictly with tons of salt.  These were awesome, and with minimal salt use. I could hardly wait for the first batch to cook for 12 hours, and so I threw in a second bag.  They were great with my weekend beers, and also great for breakfast.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

Simply divine!  Just like we used to get in Central Florida.  Since moving to NY, we haven't been able to get boiled peanuts anywhere - even at the fair.  My 7 year old kept asking for 'em, so I figured if I want to eat them here, I better learn how to make 'em.  Have tried the recipe a few times now - the first time they were perfect for the whole family just as the recipe is, except too hot for the 7 year old who kept begging for them, so I toned it down on the next batch.  I have to say, these are very forgiving - I've had to make various substitutions just because if what I had, or didn't have, on hand - used minced garlic instead of powder, or added seasonings like those that are in the Cajun seasoning but missing one or two ingredients.  And once, made it without the crab boil.  Still came out great.  Thank you so very much for sharing this, Rachael!  You're da bomb!

i have lived in florida all my life, growing up my grandpa made boiled peanuts every weekend. especially during football season. the one thing this recipe is missing is a can of beer (i use busch, since its what my grandpa use to drink) the barley & hops in it give the peanuts the distinct flavor that boiled peanuts should have.

I am Sooooo impressed with this receipe!! No longer does this Jersey Girl have to wait to go down South for her favorite snack! The spice is just right, the saltiness is just right.... the only thing I might change is the cook time, as many of the previous reviewers have  stated... I would keep in the slow cooker closer to 30 hours for for a softer bite, HOWEVER.... LOL, I couldn't help sneaking bowl after bowl after about 24 hrs of cooking... ALSO... no one talks about storage life... I've checked and these can stay in the fridge safely for alittle over a week,...although some sites say almost a month is fine, but to be on the safe side, I would stick with the former.... ENJOY!! FABULOUS receipe!!!!

This was my first attempt at making any recipe for boiled peanuts and these are divine!  I used two 3 oz packs of Mt. Olive sliced jalapenos (with the juice!) because that's what I had on hand and followed a recipe on here for the cajun seasoning. I also used 3 tbspns of the cajun seasoning and cut the salt back to 1/4 cup to ensure more spice than saltiness and it was awesome.  I had plenty to share and several have asked for this recipe - thank you!

First off I have to say I have NOT tried this recipe, but just wanted to say I have tried boiled peanut, and I do like them, but like other Northerns was unsure of how to eat them, didn't know if you eat the whole thing or just the peanut.  Once I found out the correct way, just eat the peanut, I have had them many times over the years, they remind me of a little boiled potato...Just figured I let others know NOT to eat the shell, and yes they do get very soft, so if you are looking for a "Northern" type peanut, look elsewhere.  Enjoy!

yummo! great recipe...i didn't use the jalapeno peppers cause i didn't have any. They were still delicious though. The longer they sit the hotter they get.

Absolutely Superb! I cooked in pressure cooker for 2 hours and slow cooker for additional 2 hrs.  Very good peanuts.  Thanks!
