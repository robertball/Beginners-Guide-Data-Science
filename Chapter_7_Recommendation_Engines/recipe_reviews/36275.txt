Yum. This was very good. I think next time I might add more honey as the flavor wasn't very pronounced. Either that or marinate it in honey first. I pan fried the chicken, but think I will try baking it next time to see if I can cut back on the oil.

Very good ! Used 6 boneless, skinless thighs. Could have tripled the honey mixture tho as I didn't have enough to coat twice. The first that were coated twice were Great !!! Didn't make the tomato-corn confetti. Tomatoes are on a recall right now. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This is one of the best fried chicken recipes I have tried.  It comes out perfect every time. The honey flavor is not very pronounced but that did not detract from the taste for me. You also have to monitor the heat a bit more closely since it tends to brown faster because of the honey.

Great recipe.  Added cilantro to the confetti.  Next time I'll use lime instead of lemon.  Would suggest that you pound chicken thinner so it will cook through quicker as the coating does get quite brown.

Love this recipe! I've made it at least a half-dozen times for company... all with rave reviews. To add even more kick, I increased the jalapeno amount for the chicken breading.

I had high hopes for this recipe with the honey and jalapeno, but the biggest problem is that the coat mixture with the egg becomes too thick and doesn't stick to the chicken. It slides off in an unappetizing way that just doesn't seem healthy or pleasing to eat. When heated, the the properties of honey lose its sticky factor, and this doesn't help the situation. Taste-wise, it's ok, but overall disappointing.

I couldn't find Old Bay seasoning so I improvised by making my own using the spices that are in Old Bay. Also, I used jalapeno spice rather than chopping jalapenos. The batter tends to burn easily when frying. I cooked mine for 5 minutes on 1 side and it turned black. Overall, this turned out very good, but my kids didn't like it because they said it was too spicey.

Yum! Great recipe!  Even my son, the picky eater, loved the chicken. I enjoyed both and so did my husband.  I'll definitely be making this one again.  The only changes I made was adding a tad more honey to the egg mixture and I used a whole can of corn, which was probably more than was called for in the recipe.  I kept the heat just below med and the chicken browned up perfectly.  Southwest style bbq beans made a great side with this dish.

We thought this was very tasty and very easy. My husband will only eat tomatoes tentatively, though, and they were too much for him in this recipe. In the future I'll heat up the tomato-corn confetti and serve it warm.

the only thing i would change is more honey and less old bay seasoning. maybe add some more of a different kind of seasoning, not sure what. i also cut the chicken into bite size pieces for easier cooking.
