If I could have put anything lower than 1 star...that would have been more than this recipe deserved.  I cannot believe I actually read this recipe and decided to make it because I wanted to do something easy in a slow cooker.  This person must have been on some type of hallucination medication...and you know what I am talking about!  This was the worst sauce I have ever tasted.  Thank goodness I had a jar of Classico sauce in my pantry to save my family for dinner that night.  I am warning you....never use this recipe.  It is not edible.  It's not fit for the bugs that live under my house to eat!!  Please...for God's sake....do not make this sauce!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We really liked this sauce!  Scaled the dried seasonings down a bit since I am sure the author meant teaspoons instead of tablespoons.  Found many of the other reviews to be cruel and out of line so I decided to give this recipe a try regardless of some of the mean spirited reviews.

I made this again using only 1 tablespoon of the spices, replaced thyme with basil, and then added about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and it was much more to our liking.

This sauce is really good.  I didn't have a crockpot big enough so I used my Nesco oven and set the temp at 250 degrees and cooked it for about 6 1/2 hours.  I then put the sauce in canning jars and processed it for 35 min.  I'm looking forward to trying the sauce on pasta!

Yuck! I always try to find one positive because some people cannot take criticism well, and I usually find ONE good thing about a recipe. The only GOOD thing about this AWFUL sauce is that my crock pot is finally rid of it. I cannot believe this is a recipe that's been passed on for generations! The spices are so overwhelming and do not blend kindly. This was awful--one spoonfulwas all it took to realize that we weren't having it for dinner that night--or EVER AGAIN!

I will not make this again.  The slow cooker/crock pot tends to really bring out the taste of dried herbs--it magnified it so that the herbs were overwhelming. We couldnâ€™t even eat this.  Sorry!

This basic spaghetti sauce is a great starting place for someone that isn't sure how to make in the slow cooker.  I was surprised at how much flavor the extra spices added.  I would not have normally used that much.  I did add a little bit of sugar as well since I found the sauce a little bitter.

Basic sauce. And it is TEASPOONS. I have a feeling the author must have meant that because dried seasonings are very powerful. And the only reason it was probably overwhelming to anyone else is because they used tablespoons. I don't think this recipe deserves all those negative reviews.

This sauce was great and smelled up the entire house with it's yummy aroma! I put raw home made meatballs in mine, cooked it on low for 10 hrs. and served it over whole wheat pasta. Yum! Yum! Thank you for sharing!

EXcellent sauce for being so easy and effortless. I scaled it down to six and it still made enough for my family of four and then I froze half. I made a few changes, I replaced the rosemary with basil, used half as much thyme and substitued the other half with parsley, added 1 tbsp of sugar, and some italian sausage. I also only cooked it for 3 hours, I think any longer would have made the flavor start to deteriorate. Its so nice to be out of the house all day and not have to worry about your sauce. Thanks for this great recipe!

This recipe has SO many spices, but no basil.  What is spaghetti sauce without basil.  I substituted basil for the thyme which, to me, belongs on fish, not spaghetti.  Also, it was so thin, I used some crushed tomatoes instead of all sauce.  I also cut the measurements down to teaspoons instead of tablespons, but it was still too spicy.  This may be a good place to start, but it has a long way to go.

I gave this as a 5 star because it is a perfect base recipe for a starter or seasoned chef. Take the rosemary, thyme and oregano down to 1 Tablespoon and add it to taste after that, everything else looks good by reviewing.  I of course would add 1/2 cup grated parmesan in the sauce and cook my meatballs in the sauce spooning out some of the grease and leaving some for flavor.  Another trick for some beginners. Remember that when cooking spaghetti sauce that if its to thick add  some water or  and if its runny just take the lid of and allow it to cook off for awhile.   This is certainly a good base recipe anyone cooking this be warned that either the Author meant 3 teaspoons or likes a very spicy sauce.  Try it my way and than slowly add more spices as you go.  The thing I like most about this recipe is that it is a good base if your correct the spices.  After that you start adding things to your families liking and it becomes your recipe that you can hold on to and pass it on down to your kids.  Unless you want to use fresh tomatoes or crushed tomatoes this is a perfect starter spaghetti sauce looking to be fully customized to your taste.

I LOVE this sauce!  I like chunky sauces, so I added some chopped tomatoes, zucchini, and yellow squash.

I used this recipe as a starter, the sauce was a bit strong at first, but the next day it was great!  I added some brown sugar, basil and Italian seasoning to the mix.

Wow, I'm really surprised by some of the cruel reviews. Anyway, we make a version of this sauce and love it! I don't put nearly as many spices in, and add some browned, seasoned ground sirloin. We also don't use as much tomato sauce, and I add a can off diced tomatoes for texture. I simmer it all day on the stovetop (with meat) then serve it with thin spaghetti. 

I will never use Ragu again.

Please can you explain what tomato sauce is. In Australia tomato sauce is like ketchup, surely that's not what you mean. Do you mean puree?

I had never thought about putting rosemary and thyme in spaghetti sauce, so I was nervous but curious about this recipe.  Taste wise, it was not my favorite spaghetti sauce.  However, everyone still ate it, and the leftovers will be used in other dishes.  Texture wise, I love it.  I will adapt my spaghetti recipe for use in the crockpot.  I started from whole tomatoes versus sauce, and cooked on low overnight.

This was the first time I have tried making my own spaghetti sauce since I usually opt for the more convenient jars of sauce. This sauce was very easy to make and was loved by my husband and 2 year old child. I will definitely be saving this recipe for future use.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. My husband who often gets heartburn didn't bother him one bit. It made alot of sauce so I frozen 2 more serving of it. I didn't add the rosemary because I don't like it. Will make again.

We DID NOT like this recipe at all!  I decided to make this and upon adding the ingredients I noticed all the tablespoons of spices and decided to put 85% less then what it called for and it still came out horrible.  We WILL NEVER use this recipe again.

This sauce was good, and yielded a lot of sauce, but I thought there was a little too much spice in it.  If I make it again, I'll reduce the spices to my taste.

I have made this sauce about five times and it comes out great every time. The one thing we did was add some browned ground beef with some paprika. Remember everyone...the recipes are based on the people who make it and would not be offended it you "Tweaked" it to your individual liking. Good recipe Angeleyes :-)

We all enjoyed this sauce. Next time I'm going to crush the rosemary before adding it, but otherwise I enjoyed all the spices. I don't understand all the complaining reviews on here.  I also added Italian sausage to make it meaty.

This sauce was great plenty of left overs which we were happy to eat again. We did however add some brown sugar and extra garlic and Italian seasonings, along with pepperoni and mushrooms and ground hamburger. It was no longer fat free when we were through with it. This was a family favorite.

This sauce is excellent!  I cut down on the tomato sauce and paste to 2 cans to fit in a 5 quart crockpot.  I also cut down on the spices to 1 tablespoon and added 1 cup water and 1 tablespoon of honey to cut down on the acidity.  I added meatballs from the recipe - Mixture for meatballs, meatloaf or burgers from this site.  This combination was delicious!  Everyone loved it.

Amount of herbs used is just way too much!! THree tablespoons of each makes the sauce too strong, and there is nothing in the recipe to reduce the acidity of the tomatos.  We didnt like it at all, but probably could adjust the amount of the herbs to our own tastes.

I tried this recipe and thought it was awesome.  I thought the seasonings and ingriendents were exactly what was called for.  My 4 year old loves it and I love how easy it freezes to have some ready whenever I need some.  Thanks I will use this recipe again.

I used this with Ravioli and with Stuffed shells and will freeze the rest.  I was able to dump it all in the slow cooker in just a few minutes.  The kids thought it was delicious.  I will use this again.  A nice mix of spices but not too spicy for the little ones...

It says 10 servings so obviously it should be scaled down a little if you aren't making it for a big family I scaled it down to make 4 servings and found it quite delicious, my husband went back for thirds lol.

This is now my family's favorite; but there seem to be a couple of errors.  I think the dried spices which say 3 Tablespoons should have been 3 teaspoons, which is one tablespoon. That's what I use. And the nutritional information seems to be way off - it makes more than 10, 1/2 cup servings, and I can't imagine anyone eating 1 1/2 Cups! The sodium and potassium counts are much too high for one serving - the total sodium for 5 28 oz tomatoes and 3 6 oz paste is 760 g!

The first time I made this, I think I used like 5, 15 oz cans of sauce and two of the paste (Contadina for both). I had misread or couldn't figure out, whatever the case, it came out great and the family loved it! in that one I used some frozen meatballs but not enough. 
The next time I used tablespoons of crushed red pepper by accident (cooking in a rush; not good!) Spaghetti with a kick! This was not for the faint of heart nor taste bud. Too "warm" for my family but I had many friends who thoroughly enjoyed it!
This time out, I dropped 4 cans of sauce and 3 of paste w/ just shy of the spices called for but 3 bay leaves instead of one and two 20 oz bags of meatballs. On a quick taste of the sauce, I think this is the best yet!
Great recipe producing a wonderful, earthy, Italian flavor! 

Cooking is not science. Cooking is art. Treat it as an adventure and enjoy or learn; either way, you are better for having tried.

This was a fabulous idea!  I did reduce the size of the batch.  I used herbs that I like in my sauce.  Before making this, I was surprised by the comments of how strong the spices were, because I usually put a ton in my sauce.  I must agree, it was a bit "herby."  I think the reason is because of it cooking covered in the slow cooker (versus my trying to cook down the sauce on the stop top).  Either way, I used it to make baked ziti for Christmas Eve, and it was a HUGE hit!  I will make my sauce this way all the time...what a great time saver.

I agree with everyone else that the spices were a little overpowering.....I as well had to add sugar to help with the acidity of the tomato's.  It is very basic and a good start for someone who doesn't know where to start with making sauce....otherwise I thought it was just okay.

Mine is still cooking so I cannot rate the taste.  I agree with others that it will not fit a 5 QT crock pot.  
Suggest rewriting the measurements to fit a standard size crock pot.  I have 45 oz of tomato sauce
and 6 oz tomato paste yet to add to a full pot.  5/30/01:  Way too spicey.  A neighbor suggested the Tablespoons should have been teaspoons of spices.
I think the servings are 100, not 10 for 5 quarts of sauce.

This made great sauce very easily because of the slow cooking.  basically mix and forget. The sauce was really good and I used it as a sauce base in a number of pasta disches.
