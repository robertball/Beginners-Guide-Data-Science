This was delicious! I used about 3 more cloves of garlic and didn't have walnut oil. I used 1/4 cup of vinegar as well. My husband loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

I have now made this several times and it is a great winner.  Everybody loves the dressing especially.  Only difference I have made is to add Parmesan instead of the dearer cheese. Thank you

Delicious although it seems like the dijon might be clashing with the potatoes a bit.  I am going to keep all the other ingredients and try something different in place of the dijon next time.

The dressing is very delish but I had to add a little of seasoned rice vinegar to make it more tangy... :)

A delicious and delicate blend of flavors, and an attractive, colorful dish. I'm sure I'll be making it again.

My husband said this was his favorite salad ever!  Arugula is essential, it tasted much better than with mixed greens.  Also, I thought the dressing was great, even after omitting the roasted, peeled red peppers and walnut oil.  Try it!!

The combination of the sweet potatoes and the arugula turned out to be quite tasty.  I didn't have any fresh red bell peppers, so I substituted roasted red bell pepper paste in the dressing.  I felt like walnuts would go nicely with this salad, so I added a handful of chopped walnuts in the end.  My only problem with this salad is that it is very time-consuming--washing, peeling, chopping, and roasting the sweet potatoes took more time than making the main dish!!

This really was a delicious recipe and the flavors work so well together. At first I was just eating the sweet potatoes by themselves and didn't want to dip them in the sauce but once I did I realize that they are made for each other! I honestly didn't change a thing about this recipe and loved it

This was phenomenal. And to give it some variance in texture, I thinly sliced raw cauliflower and tossed it in with the salad. (Plus, I don't like peppers!) I lived this recipe. Amazing and delicious.
