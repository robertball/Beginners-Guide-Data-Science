I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw but I needed a recipe to use up a bag of shredded cabbage I had.  I chose this because I thought the peas would add a little extra nutrition for my kids.  It was actually pretty good.  The recipe did not specify type of mustard to use and I only had yellow, so I used that.  Maybe next time I'll try brown. The peanuts added a great crunch and the peas added nice color. (I left the peanuts whole.)  I will use this in place of any other coleslaw recipe if the I need to make coleslaw again arises.

I've had this recipe in my file for a long time and never made it.  I had a huge head of cabbage in the fridge and looking for a way to use it.  I thought I'd try this for a different change of pace.  It was delicious.  My husband and I both love curry flavor, so this was right up our ally.  Here are my changes:  add a small tart apple cut into little pieces, use only about 1 cup of peas tops, less salt, toast the peanuts to bring out the flavor.  I also added a little fennel seed.  My husband and I ate almost the whole batch just the two of us it was so good.  I made it again the next night because I still had more cabbage to use up.  Brought the leftovers to a neighbor and she called exclaiming how much she liked it.  I think it would be great to take to a potluck because it's different.  It holds up well too.  Still good after a day in the fridge.  If you need to thaw peas in a hurry, just put them in a bowl and run hot water over them from the tap.  It thaws them out without cooking them.  I hope more people try this wonderful recipe.

It was okay....not enough flavor, maybe more curry next time or hot!

I did use the brocoli slaw for more of a crunch which was nice.  

I like the idea of the peanuts and peas.  I have added frozen peas (thawed) to salads/slaws before.

We really liked it (including our kids), I was actually kinda surprised.  I wanted a "different" slaw and this fit the bill with what I had on hand.  Quick, easy, tasty!

Great dressing. I used Old-Style Prepared Mustard (with the seeds still in.) Took me all of five minutes to make and turned out to be a great snack.

We really enjoyed this coleslaw.  The curry powder added an interesting blend to the dressing.  I like that you add the peanuts right before serving as this kept the peanuts nice and crunchy.

Great tasting coleslaw!  I will cut down on the dressing next time, but the taste was wonderful, so might just double the peas, cabbage and peanuts.  I used raw peanuts in this; there is plenty of salt in the mayonnaise and mustard, so didn't need it in the peanuts.  This is so good that I have already made it more than once!

My husband HATES mayo based slaws, but this one he loves.  Curry powder makes all the difference... go figure

I used a bag of coleslaw mix and doubled all the other ingredients, except the peanuts (didn't have them) Yummy! I was snacking on it as soon as I mixed it together... had to make sure it tasted ok ;)  I can only imagine how it will taste once it sits in the fridge for a bit.  The curry powderand mustard give it a nice tang.

I made this for Memorial Day. It was very well received--only about 2 tablespoons left. I used broccoli/ cabbage slaw because I had it. The curry powder was perfect!

I made this exactly as written.  I do like curry, however this didn't do anything for me.

Good but not outstanding.  I did add more curry powder after reading other reviews and we found eating the peas with the shreds of cabbage ackward.

Surprisingly good! I'm not the biggest fan of curry but this amount worked well. A nice change from the usual coleslaw. I used low-fat versions of sour cream and mayo but otherwise made this as written.
