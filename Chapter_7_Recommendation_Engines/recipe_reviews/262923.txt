I made this for when I volunteer at the USO and the troops loved it and asked me to make it again.  Because I cook for so many (at least 50) I added a bag of Pictsweet peppers and onions and several cans of corn and green beans to make it stretch as far as possible.   I couldn't understand why there were so few reviews and then realized it was the method of cooking that many people dont have the appliance mentioned in the recipe.   I poached the chicken and then sprinkled the ranch dressing on it,  and then made the sauce (which included a whole bottle of ranch dressing) and folded the pasta into it.  It was simple and very very tasty.  I will be making it again for sure.

I cooked this for my family and they liked it. The amounts that the recipe called for were exact, but my only complaint is that I couldn't taste the ranch. I don't know if I needed another packet of ranch or if I should've used ranch dressing.

This was so INCREDIBLY delicious!!! I just got an insta-pot and was looking for a recipe.  I was stunned at how fast the chicken cooked and was super moist.  We didn’t have a “plain” cheese sauce so we just doubled the amt of shredded cheese.  SO rich and creamy.  I did however make 2 mistakes.  My chicken was partially thawed so ended up scorching one of the breast.  This led to the machine telling me “burned food” when i got to the pasta “cooking”.  Luckily, it didn’t burn and the 10min it took for the pot to re-pressurize actually cooked the pasta  so it was all good.  Will DEFINITELY try again , the family made it disappear !

Made it everyone liked it, we will make it again. May add the other half of the milk to give it a little more sauce. I added 10 slices of bacon that is what was in the package. I also used 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs other than that I followed the recipe.

Easy to make.  I used 3 chicken breast -  making it more meatier.  Added a salad and garlic bread - I good hearty meal. Really easy to make - gives you a chance to clean up as it cooks making it a simple clean-up at the end of the meal

Oh, my goodness, this is the perfect comfort food.  Not only is macaroni and cheese aspect present, but one doesn't feel guilty because the chicken adds protein.  We also added carrots, and left out the bacon.  This is delicious.

Loved it! I've only had my instant pot for a day and really was excited to find a nice dinner for my husband and I to make tonight and nothing too crazy as I'm a super beginner with the pot! This recipe tasted amazing! I followed it but had trouble finding the cheese sauce at my local grocery store. I wound up getting easily melted blocks of Velveeta cheese.  Saving this recipe for sure!

It was yummy, but I more or less doubled it & as a result, it seemed less "ranch" and more like a chicken & bacon infused mac (in this case rotini) & cheese. That's nothing to complain about in my book, though. Since it was my first time doing frozen chicken in my Wolfgang Puck electric pressure cooker (essentially an Instant Pot), I was amazed by how well-cooked yet moist the chicken came out.

Holy cow. I have an Autistic child and she made this herself. I handled the chicken. All stove top no pressure cooker. We omitted the bacon and onion powder. Our cheesy sauce of choice was Progresso. She said it was too spicy but once everything was mixed she loved it. We only used boneless white chicken. Enjoy!!!
