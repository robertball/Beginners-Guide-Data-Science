very close to the real thing only better since they have that "homemade" taste. i suggest keeping with kathy's instruction of nickel size or even smaller. if they are bigger, they don't spread out as nice and once you add the filling and another layer it becomes a little awkward to bite. also, the smaller they are the crisper they are. if you want them bigger maybe press them out a bit before putting them in the oven. i've made these for the last couple of years and everyone loves them, especially my oreo-freak dad!!

I wouldn't call these a copy of oreos, but they are very good.  The ease in which this mixes up, and the great taste and nice presentation makes this cookie a winner.  (They look like they were time consuming to make but really weren't.) My kids are asking to make them for their AWANA's club cookie exchange.  That's high praise.  I mixed marshmallow fluff and creme cheese icing together for the filling as per another suggestion.  The tops did slip from the bottoms a bit, probably due to the marshmallow fluff, but it tasted good.  This looks like a cookie that can be experimented with different flavored cake mixes and canned frostings for versatility too.  A keeper of a recipe.  Thanks!

I have made these about 5 times since I first found the recipe 2 years ago (I can't believe I haven't reviewed it until now!). I love them! Just make sure you take the author's word for it and make them tiny! :D They get unwieldly if you go bigger than that. DEEE-licious!

These were fantastic! My kids made them for their home-ec class yesterday. Between making the cookies and the filling, they were time consuming, but worth it! We found that making the dough balls the size of quarters worked best. But the ones we made the size of nickels sure were cute! In fact, my kids shared the cookies with some of their friends, and they chose the small ones first. For the filling, we used the ding dong cake filling recipe(from this site) And added Peanut Butter to the mix. They were a hit. Before you add the filling, the cookies are hard like an oreo, but after adding the filling, they become soft. Either way, they are fantastic!

These are wonderful, yet so easy.  I've made these numerous times and they are always a hit.  The last time, I used mint extract and the result was delicious.

yum, yum, yum! VERY easy to make. I would also recommend sticking with very small dough balls, since the smaller, the more you end up with! :) The dough even made a very good BIG cookie for my husband. My friends are now asking when I'm going to make it again!

I couldn't really eat these because of how much shortening was in it.  My hubby liked them.  they don't really taste like oreos, just chocolate cookies w/ frosting.  The recipe made about 32 3inch finished cookies.  I found them quite difficult to remove from my parchment lined baking sheets. I won't make again unless asked to.

These cookies are wonderful if you can look past the shortening and butter requirements from the frosting.  DON'T THINK ABOUT IT!!  When putting the dough on the sheet make them about the size of a nickel.  Made 78 cookies.  Faux frosting is great with this cookie.  This is a great cookie to make for cookie exchange parties because they are easy to make and since you make small size cookies it is easy to come up with 7 dozen.  Delicious.

I am on a diet. I chose to make these cookies for my kids since I am not really that fond of Oreo's. I figured these cookies would be easy to resist... Oh silly me! These are WAY WAY better than Oreos! I am feeding them to my kids and giving them to family at every oppurtunity just so I wont eat them all!! lol   
I used 2 different kinds of chocolate cake mix, I think one was Chocolate Fudge (a cheapie brand), and the other was a Betty Crocker Triple Chocolate. They mixed up nicely. Not messy at all. I used a 1/2 Tablespoon to scoop them then rolled them into balls. Yes, very time consuming. (but worth it!)  I also decided to use my favorite buttercream frosting recipe. I added a little extra powdered sugar to make it stiffer. And they are really really good! Im going to add these to my Christmas Platters that I give to friends and family.

These were quite time-consuming. I rolled them into very small balls, about marble size. But, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to leave them as balls, or flatten them - I couldn't tell from the recipe. (Common sense told me to flatten them and that's what I did). They were really cute and they were easy to fill using the "baggie" method. (used the faux-reo filling recipe on this site). All-in-all, they turned out quite pretty, but, I won't make them again. The kids ate a few each, but all the adults that tried them only ate one. I know if something is good when not only the kids gobble it up, but the adults too!

Ok these arent oreos, but they are great! I used one box of chocolate fudge cake mix (didnt have devils food), one stick of butter (I try to stay away from shortening as much as possible), two eggs and vanilla.  How simple! I am leaning towards the fluffy peanut butter frosting that is on this site to fill them.  I think strawberry cake mix next time with the "faux-reos" filling sound very good also! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband said these chocolate cookies remind him of "soft batch" cookies!  the yield of 2 doz. is off:  I made my cookie dough into balls the size of quarters and still ended up with approx. 4 doz. sandwich cookies when finished.  These are a wonderful cookie to plan on making at cookie parties and exchanges since the dough is fast (from a mix), but rolling the dough into balls takes a while and provides a great opportunity to chat with friends while you work.  Since they're a sandwich cookie, they're also unique and fun to eat!

These cookies taste delicious, and I'll definitely make again.  However, I'm only giving the recipe 3 stars because they don't taste like Oreos at all to me or my family. The cookies reminded us of a well known puffy cocoa cereal, and the Faux-reo Frosting was good, but not like Oreo frosting.  Also, unless you're cooking for a bake sale, event, or large family, I recommend cutting the recipe in half.  This produced a bunch of little cookies.  I tried various sizes, and I recommend sticking with the nickle size balls, as they do puff & spread to a good size cookie.

Wow, these are good!  I baked for only 8 minutes because I didn't want them to get too crispy, and they were perfect.  The only complaint I have is that this makes a huge batch and they are hard to resist!!!

I am really mad, I made these last night and my husband says "these are much better than your usual chocolate cookies".  The thing is I can not be too mad, because he is right.  They are delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

i followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. Makes a TON! I may half the recipe next time and use a full recipe of faux reo filling as i ran out of filling. I found that if you cook them for eight minutes you get a softer cookie and the full 10 minutes gives you a crispier cookie, so adjust your cooking time to your preference. They are great both ways.

These cookies were fun to make and are VERY good. I imagine these would be fun to make with kids. Better than real Oreos for sure... they're on a whole different level, really. I piped on the filling w/ a freezer bag, was much easier. Oh, and definitely stick with the small, nickel-size balls of dough.

I have to give this 5 stars because of my son.  Although I don't care for sweets, my son and his friend went wild for these cookies.  They rolled the dough into balls and filled their own cookies.  Great kid-friendly recipe!

Wow! Super easy and fast to put together. I followed the recipe without changes (rolled nickel size) and cooked 8 min for the perfect shaped and sized cookies.  It made a TON!  I used the faux-reo filling recipe with it to fill them.  My son said they taste just like oreo cakesters. Thanks!

I'm giving this 2 stars just for being posted.  I had been thinking about making these from cake mix, just wasn't sure how to approach it.  The link for the filling doesn't work though! Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe.  Very easy.  I cut the recipe in half, replaced half of the shortening with peanut butter.   I am vegan so I used egg replacer.  They are very yummy.

FABULOUS! Just made these today and I think I got about 4 dozen. I made mine the size of quarters maybe? They are still soft on the outside as I baked only 8 minutes, so if you want crunchy ones maybe bake 10. The filling is very good, but I think I would add more cream cheese next time, less sugar and a little milk. The consistancy of it was perfect! These are great, I am gonna make them ALL the time! Thanks!

Fantastic. My husband said better than oreos. I read a review that said all they could taste was shortening, so I used 1 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup of applesauce. I may do even more applesauce & less shortening next time. They turned out sooo yummy!

These are just delicious! They don't taste much like oreos but almost better!! My husband and children devoured them! I made A LOT of cookies over 3 doz sandwiches. (I quit keeping track) Made them with FAUX-REO filling - they just turned out great- and are so nice looking. Will be making them again and again!

A little crumbly for my taste, I wanted them softer! Maybe next time I'll try butter. But keep them small for sure!

These are delicious and everyone raved. I used the marshamallow filling recipe from this site for Southern Moon Pies.

These cookies are excellent. I found that if you make them small and bake them a 2-3 minutes longer, they get crispy. Just the way they should be. Fill them and enjoy! Thank you, Kathy

Really good!!! I've had a box of devil's food mix staring at me for months and this was the perfect recipe to use it in. Not only are these super easy to make, frosting included, but they are about the cutest things ever. Thanks! :)

I used this exact recipe, only made two 8' cakes instead of small cookies. Worked out exactly for what I needed. Thank you.

the 3 stars is for the ingredients not the taste. I'm currently baking these, I followed the directions with the exception that I used brownie mix instead of cake as I didn't have 2 boxes of devil's food cake. I would not recommend using shortening, it made the dough all fluffy and impossible to roll into balls, I'm having to drop them with spoons on to the cookie sheet. Next time I'll make these how I normally make cake cookies, 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil per box of cake. otherwise great idea to make faux-reo's!

These are pretty good.  I tried it the first time with butter and it DIDN'T work out well.  Shortening is really the way to go.  We ate them up without any creme filling!  Thank you!

We didn't like these cookies...  WE LOVED THEM!  They turned out great!  I used the Faux-reo frosting and I couldn't have been happier.  Neither could my family.  This makes a TON of cookies, so next time I will halve the recipe.  8 minutes was the perfect time to cook for me.  They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Thanks for such an outstanding recipe!!

I halved the recipe and used a really cheap $1 cake mix box, these cookies flatten out nicely in the oven.  This recipe was really easy to make.  My hubby said these were good.  And that I should make them again.  I used Faux-reos Filling with them.

I made these for an office function--first time I made them, they were a fantastic hit! I accidentally made the cookies a little bigger so the end result looked like moon pies. I will make these again!

Very rich and sweet! I used fun-fetti cake mix. Reminded me of cookies I get at the mall. My 2 year old loved these cookies!

These were great, the kids thought they were better than store bought Oreo's and they were so easy.  I followed the recipe to a T and they turned out LOVELY! I wouldnt change a thing!  We will make these over and over.  My son's 1st grade class loved him too, so his birthday was a big hit!

I cut the recipe in 1/2. It still made plenty. Everyone loved them. This recipe is a keeper.
