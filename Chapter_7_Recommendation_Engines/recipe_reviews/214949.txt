Made these today but I added about 1/4 cup cream of coconut (the stuff used in mixed drinks but contains no alcohol). It really helped bring out the coconut flavor and gave the pops just the right amount of sweetness!! Yum!!!

These sounded so good that i doubled the recipe.  I thought the mix tasted really good and so had very high hopes.  Unfortunelty once they froze they seemed to lose some of their flavour.  I think they are good, but are lacking something, just not sure what.  They were definitely refreshing on a hot day, not sweet at all though.  I would almost think it is the coconut that is lacking to make it a true pina colada flavor, perhaps switching coconut for the vanilla?  Either way they were a little too bannany but the adults liked them and the kids didn't

Kay, rum does not freeze so you'd end up with slush.  Haven't made these yet, but I'm giving it 5 stars based on how good they sound!

I'm not a huge fan of these. I expected more coconut flavor (especially since I added coconut extract). Next time I would use coconut cream and no banana.

As written this recipe merits only 3 stars, but I think there is great potential.  Next time I'll use a very ripe fresh pineapple instead of canned.  A few drops of rum flavoring might be better than the vanilla for a true pina colada taste.  Decreasing the coconut milk to 1/2 a can would allow more of the pineapple flavor to shine through.  I'm trying to avoid sugar, but some sugar and fresh lemon juice would brighten the flavor.

I agree with those that say this has a very bland flavor and it's not very sweet.  Maybe it needs more pineapple?  The base of coconut milk is rather mild flavored and doesn't lend itself well to a popsicle.  I even added shredded coconut and a tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk to up the sweet flavor and it wasn't enough.

I just added less banana and more sugar and I think its going to be good. They are in the freezer, but the mix was good. ; )

Mine are currently freezing, so I haven't tried the finished product yet.  After reading the reviews I made the recipe as is and thought it wasn't quite the flavor I was hoping for.  I remade the recipe using a 1lb. 4oz can of pineapple slices (with juice), approximately 1/4 cup of sweetened pineapple flakes, and approximately 2 tbsp honey.  I added everything else as is in recipe.  I have a bit of a sweet tooth and I thought this was perfect.  I blended for quite a while to tried to make the coconut as fine as possible.

Very bland. What little flavor it had was overwhelmingly banana. I won't make this again.

I really liked these but, they could stand to be a bit sweeter. Next time I'll add pineapple juice and some dried coconut. Overall, I thought that this recipe makes a good base for a great popsicle.
