Tasted amazing! If you want to have higher nutritional value, skip the stove step and just mix it all up in a bowl and after dropping on wax paper, put it in the freezer! My family loved it!

My mom and I made the original no-bake cookies many times while I was growing up.  I always loved them, but I haven't made them in a long, long time.  When I came across this recipe, I decided to give it a try and see if they were as good as what I remember the originals to be.  We loved this recipe.  It's not too sweet.  I used a little less than a cup of honey which was perfect for our tastes.  I also added a couple tablespoons ground flaxseed meal, and I doubled the vanilla.  I used natural crunchy peanut butter.  The texture is softer than the original, but they set just fine.  The texture is great...creamy and a little chewy from the oats.  This one's a keeper for us.  I think it would work great with agave or brown rice syrup, too.

I liked that these were healthier than the regular no bake cookies.  I have heard so much about the health benefits of coconut oil but this was the first time that I had used it in a recipe. These were quick and easy to make! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I gave this 5 stars because for "healthier" and considering the ingredients used, these were very good and the sweetness was not overpowering, and most importantly, my kids loved these cookies.  I tweaked the recipe a bit and added about 1/2 cup of ground flax, used 1 3/4 cup oats instead of the 2 cups, 3/4 cup of honey instead of the 1 cup asked for, and 2 teaspoon of vanilla instead of 1.

This is my one and only review ever, and so it says a lot that I'm choosing to review this deliciously PERFECT cookie.  Easy to make, wholesome ingredients and super DELICIOUS. I made some adjustments, however.  1) Substituted brown rice syrup for honey  2) used only 3/4 cup brown rice syrup instead of 1 cup - came out PERFECT   3) added 1/2 tsp of salt   4) doubled the vanilla.  Also, I live in Southern California - it gets warm inside my house no matter what season it is.  So I threw these in the freezer for 10 minutes and keep it in the refrigerator between taking bites!  Just a warning: these melt really quickly, they are wonderfully messy on your fingers!  I have now shared them with many people and no matter what the "taste bud" range, they have LOVED them.  TRUST ME: SO DELICIOUS!  MUST TRY!  Thank you for this recipe!

I made two batches, the  first one I followed the directions exactly. It was good but I'm used to the super sweet white sugar ones so for me they weren't quite sweet enough; although still very tasty for what they are. The second batch I made with real maple syrup and they were much sweeter and more along the lines of the super sweet white sugar ones. This will definitely be my go to recipe from now on!

Best No-Bake by far!  A little heavy on the oil.  I cut it in half the second time.  Added raisins!  Definitely a keeper!

I made No Bake Cookies III and this recipe on the same day.  I used organic ingredients in both.  What I didn't realize was missing from this recipe is the milk.  In the NBCIII cookies I used almond milk instead of regular milk.  This recipe doesn't call for milk at all.  When the DH compared them he said that this recipe tasted more like dark chocolate even though I used the same cocoa powder in both.  So, in the future I'd like to find a way to incorporate some almond milk in these without affecting the consistency. Other than that, they were PERFECT!

I will never make no-bake cookies the old way ever again!!!  I've always LOVED no-bake cookies but stopped making them because of all the sugar and butter in them.  For this recipe I did use 100% pure maple syrup instead of honey and I didn't add the flaked coconut either but the taste is outstanding!!  I am in LOVE!  Thank you soooo very much for sharing this recipe!

I followed this recipe as directed EXCEPT I did not boil the liquid as one reviewer recommended.  These are really good!  & they do set up quickly :) 5 min in the freezer!  I may cut back on the honey as they are a little to sweet for me.

I made these raw. I put all ingredients into food processor and whipped it up quickly and easily.  I cut coconut oil down to 2 TB and also cut down the PB to I think around 1/2 cup, not sure didn't measure and honey to half of stated amount. The consistency and taste were perfect.  Stored them in the fridge. Way better then snacking on chemicals and crud. Just be careful to use portion control. I cut down the PB, honey and coconut oil and looks to be around 111 cals a ball! I popped a few before I worked out today and felt great.  2 thumbs up.

I don't always include the coconut flakes or cocoa. Sometimes I add pecans or almonds to mine cause I use smooth pb. 
I never cook it. I melt the coconut oil by itself  and then I add the pb, vanilla, honey and cocoa(if I use it) and then last I stir in the oatmeal.  I use 1/2-3/4 cup of honey. It's too sweet with an entire cup. 
I always scoop them into muffin pan  in cupcake liners and put the lid on it. We then have cookies for the next few days in the freezer ready to go. I think I will try to cut back on the unrefined coconut oil next time and see how they turn out.

My family LOVED this recipe. It worked out exactly as it should have. I always use Orange Blossom Honey and we swear it tastes way better than clover or any other kind. My family doesn't like any other honey.  These are really sweet which is why my kids love them. I can only eat one and I make them small. I keep these in a zip lock in the freezer and they last a really long time. This recipe is a keeper!

Found them too oily. Will cut amount coconut oil in 1/2 next time. Made them into bars instead of cookies. They reminded me of "Eatmores".

I have made this twice now, and I love this recipe! I use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa, left out the peanut butter and added a cup of slivered almonds. Perfect treat full of dark chocolatey almond goodness. You do have to refrigerate them so that they will lose the tackiness caused by the coconut oil. These are much better than regular no-bakes, which I find are way too sweet for my taste.

These are great! Surprisingly, they're better than the less healthy version of the recipe. More fudge-like. 
I think I'll stick with this recipe from now on, even though it means I'll have to keep a supply of coconut oil in the house. (one time, I added about 6 tbsp of ground flax, increased the quick oats by 1/4 cup, added a sprinkle of salt, and skipped the vanilla and coconut. That was good, too.)

I followed the recipe to a "T" and will definitely be making it again - so good and NATURAL which is what I love so much!  Next time, I'm going to try with a little less honey (or Maple Syrup) and less coconut oil. The reviews have been spot on - my 8 year old sons and my not-a-chocolate lover husband all loved them!! Thanks for sharing!

Yep, pretty good.  They do taste more like dark chocolate, as another reviewer commented.  I found these plenty sweet, so I might cut back just a touch on the honey next time.  I also added more 1/2 c. more oats.

I have made this too many times to count.  They are chewy and soft and delicious!  The only problem is not eating them all myself.  I've tried honey and maple syrup and both work well.

I made these using natural PB "Adams". They were missing that rich flavor that comes with other PB brands, I even added a bit more honey. I found them boring and simply not amazing.

I would love to give this five stars! If I didn’t make any changes, it would get five stars – I think recipes that lend themselves to be delicious made both according to the recipe or slightly altered deserve five stars.  I made according to the recipe, and thought it was really good! I cut back to 3/4 cup honey and increased to 1 tablespoon vanilla.  I choose to heat the oil, honey, PB, and cocoa powder together until the cocoa was melted. I did not bring it to a boil – no need for that! Then I added it to quick cooking oats and macaroon coconut.  Each time I have made this, I have needed to add a bit more oats, maybe because I use the smaller grained quick cooking kind. We all like these! Teenagers ask me to make more!

This was delicious! I didn't use peanut butter or shredded coconut and just put it in the freezer for 5 minutes to cool! 
PS. Use organic cacao for a richer flavor!

I use about 1/3 of the sugar... 1/3 cup plus 2 tbsp. maple is great and enough for us! We also use cacao mass instead of powder. And I didn't have coconut flakes, so I used 1/2 cup chia seed instead. They were perfect.

Very sweet so chill on the honey!! I halved the oil, doubled the vanilla and added a little salt. I put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes and loved the result! (besides it being too sweet) Nice recipe

These were delicious! The only changes I made were to cut the amounts of honey and coconut oil in half, because the amounts given seemed way too much to me. The cookies were a bit crumbly, probably because I cut the oil down, but the flavor was fantastic. Definitely satisfied my chocolate cravings without having to eat sugary junk. My kids loved them, too. Thanks for this!

Have been making these for over a year now.  We add some raisins (1C boiled 2min) plus some ground flax seed and wheat germ (1T each) and substitute some whey protein power for some of the cocoa.  for healthy protein!

Also I discovered that I can use my wife's awesome cupcake pans and papers and set those in the fridge to set..  Then just drop them all in a big bowl in the fridge to store for the week!

I didn't exactly measure any of the ingredients except for the oats which I did go a half cup less with. I used half honey and half maple syrup to sweeten and used half organic peanut butter and half chocolate peanut butter. Also added a pinch of pink Himalayan salt. They turned out great!

Love this recipe and this type of cookie.  I omitted the coconut in one batch and added it for another batch.

I used half honey and half maple syrup. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written. Came out really soft and oily, and they did not set at room temperature even after a couple hours! They had to be stored in the fridge in order to be able to pick them up. They are however very satisfying chocolate and peanut buttery treats without the guilt! I have to say that after a few days they tasted even more delicious! Thanks for sharing :)

These are the best no bake cookies! I was able to use agave to replace the honey and a a combination of nuts, coconut, and flaxseed for the cup of coconut. I've also made these without the cocoa and have added unsweetened Cheerios.My husband who cannot have sugar or gluten loves these. He thinks it's terrible if we ever run out.

These were so much better than I was really expecting I have to admit. A real tasty treat I will be making more. Quick and simple and very good.

Okay, I think I died and went to heaven eating these. These are SOOOOO good!!! I can't believe they are healthy!! My only complaint is that you will want to eat too many of them and they are high in calories (162 calories per rounded tablespoon). I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfect! I would recommend rolling them into balls instead of just dropping them on the wax paper because they will have a better shape to them. Trust me, you need to make these cookies and you will not be disappointed :)

I followed the recipe except I have a little lady who does not like coconut so instead, I just added a half cup of oats. ( You cannot taste the coconut oil) This was by far the best no bake cookies I have ever had! I'm never going back to the sugar and butter recipe again. It really enhanced the chocolate flavor. So much so that I would say it over takes the peanut butter. But I was really seeking out a chocolate fix and this was it!

Very simple and easy to make...My 8yo helped with most of the work, even spooning out the cookies. We substituted almond butter, tastes just like almond joy!

Trying to cut back on sugar and salt and butter all around, but craving these cookies.  They are alright, but not even close to the rich, terrible goodness they could have been if the original recipe (with butter and white sugar) had been used.

While they are edible, they are not what I expected.  Too soft.  Too much honey (and I like honey) and just, well, they just tasted off.  Not what I was expecting.  And that is what I get for trying to make a decadent food into a healthy food.  

Nice try, but these just weren't exactly right...  Maybe no honey next time, many half white sugar (*gasp) and half Truvia, I think the coconut oil is a go, though.

I gave this five stars even though I could not eat them. Although, I have to admit I did taste a pinch of one. I am allergic to honey, but made them for my daughter and she loved. So much healthier than the original version I remember. I also added flax seed and cut back a little on the honey. Just wondering how I could make this and replace the honey with stevia.

Yum!  Used agave nectar in place of the honey and it worked very well as a vegan cookie recipe.  I got about 20 good sized cookies from this recipe.

So, so good!  So moist and fudgy. No more dried out, crumbly cookies. I'm not a huge honey fan so I used 1/3 cup honey, 1/3 cup agave and 1/3 maple syrup.  I've made them twice so far and the second time added a little less oil and little more oats and they weren't quite as oily. Also added ground chia seeds. Tried this recipe initially for someone who can't have dairy but this will be my go to no bake recipe. Scooped them into foil muffin cups and it was easy to transport. The oil will seep grouch
