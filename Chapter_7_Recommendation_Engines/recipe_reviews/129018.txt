I made one of these today, only hot. I've got a wicked cold and wanted a change up from a Hot Toddy.

I used Captain's Tattoo Rum and cinnamon whiskey. I feel much better. Totally opened up my sinuses. This is SO wonderful.

I made this hot and it is goood. Put cider in pot until just boiling and then poured into glass with schnapps and rum. I would probably never make this cold.

Pretty tasty and a nice new addition in the autumn.  I upped the Spiced Rum to 2/3 of a cup because... well because I'm a lush. ;P.  I started off with just an 1/8 of a cup of the cinnamon because the only cinnamon Schnapps at the liquor store said "Hot Cinnamon" and I didn't know if that made a difference or not. Once I tasted it, though, I felt it was safe to pour in the other half of the Schnapps.  I think two ice cubes is a bit stingy so I added more to give it a nice chill as I drank this immediately upon making it instead of giving it some time in the fridge.  I think, though, that if it's left to sit out, the ice cubes would dilute the drink too much.  Enjoy!

Good drink.  I served to my Bunco group this fall.  Just a little too much cinnamon.  Could use less.  Will try it warm next time.  Thanks!!

Pretty good with 1 cup cider, 1 shot rum, 1 shot cinnamon schnapps.  Heat the cider, add the shots, and drink.

Its ok...I thought the apple cider would help disguise it, but the apple really brings out the flavor of the dark rum. If you're not a fan of dark rum try something else.

Very good. Used a little less rum. But it could def stand the whole amount.
