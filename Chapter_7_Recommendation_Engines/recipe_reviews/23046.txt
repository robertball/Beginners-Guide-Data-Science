This was my very first homeade cheesecake... I was surprised at how user-friendly it was.  Everyone loved it but I'll share what I think are necessary modifications:

-I would do only half gingersnap and then the other half graham cracker (or nilla wafer) for the crust... this keeps it sweet and light without compromising the ginger kick.

-I also added about a half teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.

-And as someone suggested... I made the filling first so it could refrigerate while I did the crust.  This made the marble effect work... and not "runny" like others have stated.

This is a great recipe, and i've made it twice, the first time it was OK, the second time was perfection. The 2nd time, I did what other have recommended and added more spice to the pumpkin cheesecake mixture (nothing specific, a couple shakes of clove, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg), but after reading a lot of "how to make cheesecake" websites i decided against refrigerating the mix before baking- the marbling looked perfect without it- and, unlike the first time i made it, i didn't whip the mixture "to make it fluffy." Apparently air is bad for cheesecakes.  I was also very careful to make temperature changes gradual; starting with room temp cream cheese and eggs, not refrigerating the batter, and baking the cake at 325 instead of 350, with a pan of water set on the lowest rack of the oven to increase humidity in the oven. I let the cake bake a full 45 minutes before i even peeked (which, btw, it was hard not to look!) and then when the cake was still slightly soft and jiggly in the middle (around 55 mins), turned the oven off, propped open the door with a peice of full rolled up to keep the oven door about 2" open, and let it rest in the oven for about an hour. Moved to the counter, slid a knife around the edge, covered with a plate, rest another hour, and then rest in the fridge for about 4 more hours. Lots of resting! But in the end, this cake came out PERFECTLY, with not even a crack in site! the texture was exactly right for a cheesecake, and it was yummy, yummy, yumm

This is a great recipes but I found that making the 18 serving size made better presentation. I also agree that it needed quite a bit more spice. I added all spice, cloves and ginger.

I have been using this recipe a few years now and love it!  I have even managed to convert pumpkin pie haters into lovers with this....the crust makes all the difference.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is wonderful. I made this in mini cupcakes and baked for only 20 minutes and it turned out great!! I made it for a work pot-luck and everybody raved about how the gingersnap crust was a perfect combination with the cheesecake.

I made this recipe twice and both times it was a hit!  The second time I left it in the mixer for about 10 minutes and it got really light and fluffy.  It completely filled the springform pan and looked like a restaraunt made cheesecake.  I have passed this recipe on to several friends and relatives and would recommend it to anyone!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit.  It didn't last more than 24 hours.  Which is saying a LOT since there were about 20 other desserts available.

I didn't have any gingersnap cookies available, so I added some ginger and a little pumpkin spice into crushed graham crackers.  It made a completely different and wonderful tasting crust.

I refrigerated the filling to make it thicker so it didn't just mix together.

Everyone thought this was good to eat and nice to look at as well!

Okay, but I've had better. Maybe if I had read the reviews first and added more spice and pumpkin and had refrigerated the batter for better marbling effect and checked it way before the 55 minutes, then it may have been better. Won't make again.

This turned out perfect.  No cracks and very pretty presentation.  Everyone thought it was too sweet, maybe I slipped on the sugar.  I put the water pan on the bottom rack as others suggested and it worked great.  I used cinnamon sugar graham crackers (crushed) for the crust.

I have a plain cheesecake recipe that is great, and it always makes me nervous to use a new recipe, but this one is awesome.  I took it to a work party, and everyone loved it.  I took the suggestion to make the pumpkin and plain ratio equal, and I really liked it, but I'm sure it would be great as written, too.

This is a really awsome recipe! I did have to solve a few common problems with cheesecake baking . I had all of the usual problems like cracking and and lumpy cheesecakes so here is how i made a PERFECT cheese cake. I started with preheating the oven AND the waterbath. For a waterbath i just used a turkey roaster half fill with water on the center shelf of the oven. Despite having a really nice springform pan mine is not watertight so i used a turkey roasting bag. I just placed the pan in the bottom of the turkey bag and tied 100%cotton twine around the lip of the pan to hold the bag in place and keep it from sliping. I just sniped off the extra bag about 1 1/2 inches above the lip of the pan.I brought all of my ingredients to room temp.I put cream chese in the microwave for about 15 sec a block and put the eggs in a bowl of warm water for a few min till they were room temp.I also only used a mixer to mix the creamcheese and sugar after that i used a wisk and mixed everything else by hand so that i didnt incorporate air in the mixing(that is really importaint!)I baked as directed and then without opening the door i just turned off the oven and let it cool about 5 hours. I removed the cake from the oven and cut the twine to remove the bag. I placed the cake in the fridge over night and it came out like a professional cheesecake.I also used a thin fishing line to cut the slices so it came out perfect like you see at a fancy restruant. I cant wait to make another cheesecake!

Loved it!  I add quantity to make a 12" cake.  I have had people asking me to make one for them.  I did play with it a little, though.  I added more pumpkin, and a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg (I like it stronger).    The other addition I made was bringing 3/4 c of heavy cream to a boil, then pouring over 1 c of white chocolate chips, stir until all the chips are melted.  Cool for a bit and pour onto the top of the cheesecake.  This fills in any cracks and creates a unique looking topper. If done correctly, it will fill in the area that "sinks" nearly to the edges of the cheese cake without overflowing. The ganache adds so much to this cheese cake and people will think you bought it.  You will have to convince them you didn't.

Everyone loved this cheesecake.  Very creamy, not too much pumpkin--delicious. Mine was done around 45 minutes. Every oven is different & 55 minutes is only a rough guideline.  Start checking at 30 minutes. The cheesecake is done when the center is set as stated in the recipe.  A waterbath is not needed.  The gingersnap crust was very tasty and the cheesecake was not too thin.  If you run a knife along the rim as soon as it comes out of the oven, you will have minimal to no cracking.  If you follow the recipe correctly, you will have a perfect cheesecake.  Thanks for this keeper!!

For all who read reviews and tweak! This recipe is amazing! I made it for Thanksgiving to take to the neighbors and everyone raved! I adjusted the recipe to serve 18 and it filled out my springform perfectly. Eggs and cream cheese were brought to room temp before I started. I followed the recipe as changed with the new serving size exactly. Except: Added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice to the pumpkin filling. Note - If using your mixer use the paddle attachment not the wire wisk. Also, still only need about 3/4 C filling to marble in. Baked at 325 for 70 minutes, with a pan of water on the lower rack - couldn't do a water bath my springform pan leaks. When the time was up, I turned the oven off and opened the door. Left in the oven cooling for 1 hr. Then moved to the counter to cool another 1 1/2 hrs before moving the fridge. ABSOLUTELY NO CRACKS! Crust and filling was perfect! Great recipe, has been requested for Christmas as well.

This is a wonderful and easy cheesecake. I got rave reviews at Thanksgiving! I was out of town and accidentally left my springform pan behind. I made it in a clear pyrex pie plate and it turned out great! I took a lot of the reviewers' advice while making it. Here are the changes I made: (1) I only used 1-1/4 cups of crushed gingersnaps; (2) I put 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/4 cup in the second step; (3) I put in 1-1/4 t. cinnamon and 3/4 t. nutmeg to give it more flavor since the recipe called for unprepared pumpkin; (4) After adding the batter to the baked shell, I baked it at 350 degrees for the first 15 minutes and then lowered the temperature to 300 degrees for the other 40 minutes without removing the cheesecake. This helped keep it from burning on top. It set beautifully and was just right. The person who said it was runny probably used the whole can of pumpkin instead of just one cup. The cheesecake cracked a little but everyone thought it was still beautiful! I served each slice with whipped cream and chopped pecans. Everyone wants this cheesecake again next year except they want me to make two!!

This is a great recipe! I tweaked it a bit as follows:  for the crust I used one box of Anna's Ginger Thins and one sleeve of cinnamon graham crackers for a 9 1/2" springform pan.I used a full can of pumpkin mix, 4 eggs as others have suggested, 3 pkgs cream cheese and upped the spices by about 50%. This makes for a little higher cheesecake (2 1/2" or so).The cooking (55 min.) and cooling instructions others have provided are right on the money-no cracking. A keeper!

The beauty of this cheesecake is how simple it is to make. The pumpkin also outweights the cheese - so you are getting more of a cheesecakey-pumpkin pie in my opinion.

Note - if you do not follow the recipe instructions to run a knife along the edge of the pan after baking, you will get cracks. Don't forget this part.

Great Recipe- all guests loved it- I found that if I made a circle on top with plain mix and used a chop stick to swirl my pattern came out better- I chilled my crust after baking in freezer 15 min. so it woudn't be soggy and put a pie pan of water in oven with cheesecake so it wouldn't crack- came out great!

This IS a great recipe, but it must be tweaked - the recipe, as given, is pretty much a rip-off of Kraft's Philadelphia Pumpkin Marble Cheesecake, which, in itself is good but not perfect. I've had good luck with the changes I've made to it: A bit more pumpkin is needed to create a more striking contrast between the two batters, thus a bit more sugar must be added to the pumpkin half. It can also be made without the gingersnaps - substituting crushed graham crackers instead with a little brown sugar works just as well and you don't need to bake the crust before filling. I also added more pecans to the crust and a bit of cinnamon to 'up' its flavor, but omitted the nutmeg from the batter, as few people I know actually like nutmeg, myself included. I've also completely 'Splendarized' (replacing any sugar with Splenda products) it  and had good luck with that as well as substituting with 1/3 less fat cream cheese, thus greatly reducing the sugar and fat content. As another reviewer pointed out, yes, the batter will marble better if it is allowed to thicken a bit - but refrigeration is not necessary; just let it stand for a few minutes till it is isn't so runny. And yes, 55 minutes is the TOP OUT time for this cheesecake unless you've made it REALLY thick in a pan smaller than 9" springform - start checking on it at 40 - 45 minutes, as thickness, altitude and oven differences will affect bake time. Good luck! :-)

This is probably the BEST thing I have ever cooked!  My husband and I love pumpkin cheesecake but hate waiting until October or November to find it.  I will probably be making these for Christmas because they are very easy to make and turn out beautifully.  The crust is hard enough to make slicing easy and foolproof, but the nuts keep it from being too crispy.
Not being an experienced cook myself, I tried smashing the gingersnaps in a plastic grocery bag with a rolling pin until I remembered--duh!--I have  a food processor.  That made life much easier.  I also used hazelnuts in the crust because they were cheaper than pecans, and I don't really notice the difference.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

We made this for Thanksgiving, instead of the usual pumpkin pie.  Everyone couldn't stop raving about it!  We bought enough for two cheesecakes, so we could do a practice one, but the first one turned out perfectly.  We did make changes, as suggested by other reviewers.  First, we used 1 cup gingersnap cookies and 1 cup graham crackers for the crust instead of 2 cups gingersnaps.  Then we doubled all the ingredients for the filling.  We also mixed the full amounts of ingredients, except the pumpkin, at once (for example, we did not split the sugar), then removed 1 cup before adding the pumpkin.  We had to bake for about 15 minutes longer with the double filling. The only change we'd make (and we are making it right now, in fact) would be to use half the pumpkin, and divide the regular filling and the pumpkin-added filling into equal amounts.  I know it's supposed to be PUMPKIN cheesecake, but we would have liked to have tasted a little more cheesecake. All in all, WONDERFUL!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Was absolutely delicious.  I definitely knew I had to add more spice so I added 1/2 a teaspoon of pumpkin spice as well as the rest of the spices listed.  For the marbling I just filled a piping bag fitted with a wilton 12 tip and I piped circles around each other and then drew a knife through so it resembled a spider web.  For the last 15 minutes of the estimated cooking time have the oven a crack open and then when the time is up turn off the oven and leave the cake in the oven until it is completely cooled which should eliminate cracking if done right.  Absolutely delicious recipe!

This was my first cheesecake I've ever made.  Turned out amazing, was a huge hit at the dinner party I took it to.  And my husband who isn't a big fan of pumpkin loved it!  The only thing they didn't say was to put a pan of water under the cheesecake to keep it from cracking.  You also have to be careful not to overbeat the batter once you add the eggs in or it'll crack when you bake it as well.  Luckily, I knew how to make a cheesecake and with those extra precautions & step, it turned out perfectly.  I did add a little more cinnamon than it called for, but it was perfect.

Everyone loved this, looks beautiful and taste great, the gingersnap crust is perfect, but I didn't use nuts, but increased crumbs to makeup for no nuts.  I also used whole can of pumpkin, and used pumpkin pie spice.  I baked with a pan of water in the oven and cooled in the oven afterwards and both times they came out perfect, no cracks.

This was wonderful.  I altered the crumb recipe by using ginger cookies, shortbread and 1 tsp cinnomon and 1/4 tsp ground ginger.  I then lined muffin tins with muffin liners and filled with crust which I baked for approx 10 min. Then I spooned the mixture into the cups.
Made about 18 mini cheesecakes.  Perfect for my entertaining purposes.  Will definately make again.

I have a 10" springform, so I used my 9" glass pie dish--which I think worked out better; the recipe does not make much batter. For the Springform, I would double the recipe and bake longer. Used 2 eggs & took everyone's advice: generous with the pumpkin, used a total of 1C sugar, added more spices including ginger, cloves, cardamom, coriander & black pepper. Baked with a pan of water at 350 for 20min and the rest of the time at 300 & it came out perfect (no cracks)! I will double and make again! DeLISH!

This is a very easy recipe, wich is delicious. I modified it a bit by making individual cheesecakes. Simply follow directions but instead of using a spring form pan use your muffin trays. You can use paper cups, but double them and remove them before freezing. They make perfect no fuss dessert for a dinner party.

I'm kind of torn on this recipe and so were my family who ate it. The pros were: they enjoyed the gingersnap crust (although my mom felt the crust should have had more of a "gingery" taste to it.) and it is nice to serve for Christmas or Thanksgiving since it has a strong pumpkin flavor. The cons: It doesn't really taste like cheesecake, it could have been slightly sweeter, if they had to choose between this cheesecake and a regular cheesecake they'd choose the regular cheesecake. I think the cheesecake turned out nicely for what it was, but I do think the pumpkin slightly overpowers the actual cheesecake flavor. One of my other complaints is that once the cheesecake is done, it really doesn't look marbled at all. This wasn't a bust, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. It's a fine recipe, I just won't be making it again since I felt that it was more on the "average" side. Also, as a side note for those wanting to make this recipe or any cheesecake recipe: it's not necessary to use a springform pan. I used a 9 inch cake pan and it was absolutely fine.

What an awesome holiday cheesecake!!! This was my firsy ever attempt at a cheesecake so I ws sure to read all of the reviews and look up articles about baking cheesecakes. Here's what I found to make it come out right: I wanted to do a water bath, but I didn't have a large enough pan so I just placed a pan full of water below it just so it could add moisture to the oven. And like others suggested, when the timer went off I turned the oven off and kept it in there for an hour and then refrigerated. I was also careful about keeping my cream cheese and eggs at room temperature and I beat the cream cheese until fluffy BEFORE adding the eggs or any other liquid.  I used pumpkin pie filling that has the spices in it AND added extra spices (including cloves) just because that's my personal taste. (and fyi, I could've added more! still not enough to my liking but still delicious). I increased the cream cheese to 3 packages, I definitely recommend that to have a nice, rich cheesecake. I did not use the gingersnap crust only because I didn't have any of the cookies on hand so I used the graham cracker crust from this website and I made my own whipped topping (Whipped Cream from this site, with extra vanilla of course!). All in all, this recipe took quite some time but it was FOR SURE worth it :) :)

This cheesecake was delicious. It just took me way longer the cook than instructed. I used a 9 inch spring form pan and the batter pretty much filled it up. With such a tall cheesecake I had to cook about 20 mintues more than listed.

Worth the effort! I baked mine in a plain ol' 9" pie dish and it came out great. I put the pie dish in a water bath (jelly roll pan with 1-2 inches water) to cook at the said time. I also sub 1/2 the ginger snaps with graham crackers for the crust. Turned out perfect! ***I did have some extra filling, and I made a sweet little cupcake with it. I put a gingersnap in the bottom of a muffin wrapper and poured filling on top. Baked it for a half hour at 350F. It was so cute and tasty--the gingersnap softened into a yummy crust on the bottom. I might make a whole batch like that next time.

A huge hit with the whole family! I have made this recipe several times and have found that if you use larger pieces of pecans instead of the finely chopped ones you get more of the flavor from the nuts and it doesn't affect the outcome of the crust at all.

I scaled it for 18 and didn't bother to try to swirl it. It is BEAUTIFUL layered. I did take some other suggestions and made the crust 1/2 ginger snap 1/2 graham cracker as well as adding a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. EVRERYONE RAVED about this. I made two for two parties and had no left overs!

I make this cheesecake every year. I have made it many times, and after much trial and error now always add: an entire can of pumpkin, an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and a teaspoon of pumpkin pie seasoning. My family requested a more chewy crust, so I add 1/2 cup of sugar to the gingersnap mix. I also aways put a tray of water in the bottom rack to help keep the cheesecake moist while baking( it also keeps it from cracking) This cheesecake is requested all the time, and is a wonderful alternative to pumpkin pie...it's something new, but it still has enough of that traditional holiday flavor.

In search of something different, I found this recipe for Thanksgiving.  My whole family loved the taste and it has permanently replaced the traditional pumpkin pie for the holidays.  I especially liked the gingerbread crust.

This was pretty good.  Instead I made this recipe  into mini cheesecakes using a cupcake tray (about 28 mini's) and topped them with a Pumpkin seed whipped cream (1 cup whipping cream, 3 Tablespoons powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon Vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon, or so, pumpkin seed oil).  I sprinkled a little pumpkin pie spice on top of the whipped cream!  Pretty tasty addition.  The only other thing I changed was that I used frozen pumpkin from the garden.  The boyfriend, who tells me he hates cheesecake, almost ate the entire batch before they made it to his mother's house.

This cheesecake was DIVINE! Perfect blend of pumpkin and cream cheese. And the crust - oh my goodness, so incredibly good. I made this for my in-laws Thanksgiving dinner, and they were very impressed and wouldn't stop complimenting me on it. I almost had an accident with the cheesecake last night when I was baking it though, the bottom of the springform pan almost dropped off when I was putting the cake in the oven, and so it fell a couple of inches. I was so worried when it was baking that the crust had cracked or something, and of course I couldn't really know for sure until we were cutting into it, but it turned out great. One tip though, I used a 9-in. pan and I mixed up the crust according to the directions, and when I spread it out in the pan there wasn't nearly enough to go all along the bottom and up the sides, so I will double the crust ingredients the next time I make this. Otherwise this is a great recipe and I'm sure it will be requested again since my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law absolutely LOVED it! Thanks for this fantastic recipe, Renee.

I brought this to a family holiday dinner, and everyone kept asking where I bought it.  The gingersnap crust is a winning feature....don't skip it.  No cracker or cookie crust can compare to it!  The only alteration I made was to toast the pecans before chopping them to give them an extra flavor boost.  Also, baking the cheesecake in a water bath will keep it from cracking.  I have made this 6 times, and it has turned out perfectly each time.

This is the best pumpkin cheesecake, I did exactly as  the recipe, but baked my cheesecake in a water bath. I don't know if that makes a difference or not, but my cheesecake did not crack. Mmm... I will be making this again and again.

Deeeelish and so easy to make!!! It would easily be a five star except it needed more pumpkin and spices. Next time I will add the whole can of pumpkin. The gingersnap crust was absolutely fanastic!

I *love* this recipe!  I use a blender to mix everything, and get a really nice creamy texture.   I also end up putting in more pumpkin then the recipe calls for which gives the cake a lot more pumpkin flavor - A bonus for those who do not really like the cream cheese taste. However, by adding more pumpkin, you will have to cook it longer. I cooked it in additional 5 - 10 minute spurts until the toothpick/knife came clean.

I was unsure of whether pumpkin works well in cheesecake... but it DOES!! Great recipe - but be sure to chill thoroughly for at least 4 hours, or it will be too custard-pie-ish  Delicious, and worth making for the holidays!!

This is the recipe I use every year that is DEMANDED by my family.  They don't realize how easy it is!  The only difference is I use 3 pkgs of cream cheese, makes it creamier and less runny as others stated.  It's great because you don't need to use a water bath to keep it from cracking and the marbled look is wonderful.  People can't believe I didn't buy it at a bakery!  And as another reviewer stated, it's good with 1/2 ginger snaps & 1/2 graham crackers.  I prefer it this way as I find the all gingersnap crust a little over the top but for the family get togethers, they like the full strength ginger flavor.

One word: FABULOUS!

This was my first cheesecake ever and it turned out perfectly. I really did my research before I started and it paid off. The changes I made: added 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, doubled the crust using half ginger bread snaps and half graham cracker crumbs, and preparing the batter before the crust and allowing it to chill in the fridge before swirling. Also, I put it in a water bath while baking and after 40 minutes at 350, I shut off the oven and let the cheesecake rest for the last 15 minutes. No cracks at all! Everyone at Thanksgiving said it was too pretty to cut, but tasted just as good as it looked.

Delicious. I made this in an 8x8 pan so that I could make cheesecake squares and it turned out wonderfully. I added about 1/4tsp of cloves and a few extra shakes of cinnamon. The crust is excellent.

Everyone loved it!  We have a family of non-pumpkin pie eaters and even they loved it.  The cheesecake really helped difuse the pumpkin so that there was more than a hint but not too much of a pumpkin taste.  The crust really got rave reviews!

Very easy to do. If you want to eat it the same day, you will need to make in the morning as it needs time to chill & set in fridge.

This baked up nicely except the crust got soft. I used a 7-in pan and it baked in a little over an hour at 325.  Because of the smaller pan, I used half the crust recipe and only put it on the bottom which was just enough. I used the equivalent of two eggs worth of egg beaters, made homemade gingersnaps and pumpkin puree, usedhalf reduced fat cream cheese, and put a dish of water in the oven with it. It did not crack but had a few fine lines where the swirls came together.  Overall, a good flavor blend and a nice combo of dense but not too dry. After tasting the pumpkin batter I did feel it needed a little more spice so I added a dash or two of pumpkin pie spice. I think it would be too thin if made in a 9-in pan but that's probably just our preference.

Was a disappointment. Normally I NEVER have leftover cheesecake and with this one I had lots left. Good but not good enough to make again. And the ginger snap cookies make for a crust not to my liking.

Very good... i was being lazy, and didn't even bother "marbling" it, which subsequently resulting in my forgetting to add the last 1/4 cup of sugar..... didn't even miss it!  I also doubled the spices as suggested by others.  Next time I may give it a go with Neufchatel cheese, just to see if the extra spices and pumpkin flavor would mask the lighter taste.

It didn't cave in! This is the first cheesecake recipe I've ever tried that did NOT cave in in the middle here in the high altitude of Colorado! The marbling is fun and the cheesecake is tasty, I don't like pies or desserts that are too pumpkiny, this one is just right.

Not my favorite cheesecake recipe. It was kind of bland ... needed more spices. I added slightly more spice than the recipe calls for based on reviews, but it still needed more. Also, the texture wasn't great, it didn't come out very creamy.

AMAZING! I never made a cheesecake before - and this turned out soooo good!  The only change I made was to the crust-- i didn't have gingersnaps, so I just used graham crackers (which I probably prefer anyway).  No changes at all to the cream cheese/pumpkin filling! Delicious!!!

I covered the bottom of my springform pan with foil to prevent water getting in.  The cheesecake was just ok...I added extra 1/2 cup pumpkin but was not pumpkin-y enough and the cheesecake was very soft.

Delicious! I failed a bit with the swirly-part, but I think that's more down to my artistic prowess!  I'd never EVER made a cheesecake before, and this one turned out fine! I was struggling to get the middle to cook through, but eventually turned the oven off and let it sit there. It cooked through and didn't crack!

This cheesecake is wonderful!! I have made it several times for my husband and he adores it. I have adapted it just slightly as I use the recipe for 18 servings so that it's a bit taller in the pan as well as refrigerate the plain batter for twenty to thirty minutes before marbling it into the pumpkin batter so that it stays separate and doesn't just run together. Otherwise, no changes. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

This was really good! Not too sweet and I followed the sugar by recipe. I would most certainly double the recipe for better presentation next time. I brought to Thansgiving dinner and it was pretty tiny. I added the suggested extra spices and felt it made the differnce too. The crust I did half ginger snaps and half graham.I wish I would have left more ginger snaps in though. Next time...

I'd give it more then 5 stars if I could!  Have made this the past few Thanksgivings and it has become a staple in our Thanksgiving dinner!  You won't be disappointed.  Great flavor, not overly sweet or too filling...well, unless you can't stop yourself and eat half the pie in one sitting!

I uploaded a pic. of mine; the pumpkin swirl came out brown, because I added brown sugar to that portion of the cheesecake, instead of white sugar. If you want it to look like traditional ‘pumpkin’ I’d recommend not using brown sugar in the pumpkin mix, as some have suggested. 
I doubled the crust, but would recommend doing 1 1/2 crust recipe; it was a little too thick doubled.  I’d also cut back on the butter, it was coming through the bottom of the pan, so to me that means too much in the recipe. 
I added nearly all of the pumpkin from the 16oz can (so 12oz) for a richer pumpkin taste, and also added an extra 8oz of cream cheese and an extra egg; basically I did a recipe and a half of the filling.  
Taking others advice I added extra spices to jazz up the flavor.  I baked it for 30 min at 350 and then reduced the heat and baked it at 320 for 70 min. I did get a crack on top, but I blame it on my husband who needed to use the oven to make his dinner after the cake was done, so I had to take it out right away and wasn't able to let the cake cool in the oven as I usually do.  This has proven to be the trick to a non cracked cheesecake, for me; let it cool in the oven before removing.  
I wrapped the pan in foil and set in a larger pan filled with water.  
The flavor turned out great, it had a pumpkin pie taste with a little bit of cheesecake flavor and all the consistency of cheesecake.  I got a good marble by layering the mix; started with laying the pumpkin on the bottom, th

I have made this twice so far this holiday season and have heard nothing but effusively glowing reviews. I make some minor alterations; like many other reviewers, I add more spices. I find that a little more than 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp each of cloves, allspice and ginger bring more of a pumpkin pie spice flavor to the pumpkin cheesecake mixture. If you can find a triple-ginger cookie to use for the crust I highly recommend it. My favorite brand has candied ginger chunks in the cookies and it adds a bit more snap to the crust.

Fantastic!  I didn't make it separately to marble, I just mixed all the ingredients and used it like that.  I also topped it with the maple pecan glaze from the Maple Pumpkin Cheesecake by Eaglebrand.  We also used the white ghost pumpkin puree that we roasted ourselves.  The gingersnap crust was to die for!!

This was my first attempt at baking a home made cheesecake and I have to brag that I didn't get one crack.  I followed some of the suggestions by others by making the filling first and chilling in the fridge while I made the crust, it does firm it up better for the swirl effect.  I also used a water bath in the oven.  And, I used some pumpkin spice in the mixture for extra flavor.  I will make this again and again!

Perfect! I made this pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving dessert and everyone loved it and were so impressed that it was homemade! For me, the marble effect came out perfectly. It might be because I refrigerated the batter (both the pumpkin flavored and the cup of plain batter) for about half an hour while I was making the crust. I think this made the two batters a little firmer, so they held their own a bit more. I liked the flavor of the crust, but it browned too quickly, which made it more bitter. It might have to do with the variety of gingersnap you use... next time, I might try just a milder gingerbread cookie to avoid it darkening too much. Also, the bake time was way reduced for me, it only took about 30 minutes (my oven is always too hot) so I would recommend checking in on it before the 55 minutes suggested, in case it bakes more quickly. Otherwise, delicious recipe and definitely a crowd pleaser!

Not as good as I expected based on all the great reviews. I love cheesecake and I love pumpkin pie but there was something off in this combo. The crust was great though (very "snappy") and I'll likely use it again for pumpkin pie.

I made this for a Halloween party and it was so good!  I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 rectangular pan lined with foil so I could cut it into bite size pieces. I made a graham cracker crust and drizzled the chilled bites with caramel sauce. Thanks! I will definitely be using this recipe for years to come!

I modified the recipe heavily to make a taller, New York-style cheesecake.  I started off by doubling everything except the crust and eggs.  Only 5 eggs are necessary.  I added all of the sugar at once instead of dividing it and also added 1/2 cup sour cream.  I made a layered instead of marbled cheesecake so the different flavors would be more distinct.  I used cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice because I like a variety of spices.  If you decide to make the taller cheesecake, I would suggest baking with a water bath.  I baked mine for 15 minutes at 475 and then turned the oven down to 350 and baked for about 70 minutes more.  The texture was exceptionally creamy.  There are 2 reasons I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5: the original recipe needed to be modified quite a bit and the pecans were very out of place in the crust.  Next time I would use just the gingersnaps.

I also added more spice (1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp mace).  Everyone loved it.  I took some to work and it disappeared - several people asked for the recipe.  When I made it a second time I only had two eggs and it still turned out great.  I think this is a very adaptable recipe - you can add more spice or a different crust, cook in a water bath or not,whatever you like.  It always seems to come out delicious.

This cheesecake is GREAT for pumpkin lovers...  be careful not to make the homemade crust too thick...  leave room for the filling!

Very good!  The crust came out a little soggy, but that might be my own fault.
I used a water bath & maybe I didn't foil the springform pan well enough.  I
will definately try it again soon.

We enjoyed this cake in the "field" with many friends w/ different tastes: there was none left! I have had pumpkin cheese cakes before that I didn't like ( I'm not very picky); but , this cake is excellent!The ginger snaps create this semi hard "plate" for the main course and should not be substituted. Enjoy !!!

This has been my go to holiday recipe. Every year I make several of these. I bring them to neighbors, family, work, holiday potlucks. It always gets rave reviews! Last year brought two to my boyfriend's family's Thanksgiving and they raved. My favorite recipe I ever found on this site!

The main part that I disliked was the fact that the marble affect didn't work as well as I was hoping. Wish I would've read some reviews first. Which I do now for every recipe and usually they are always helpful. I thought this was just missing something. I love to bake and know that it turned out as good as it could have even with the marbling part not working as planned. Just wasn't what I was looking for. Thanks though

Even better the next night! The whole thing was gone completely within 2 days. I did double the amount of all the spices and it turned out well - otherwise I think they would've gotten hidden. The pumpkin flavor was also there but not too strong. I used 1 package of 1/3-less-fat cream cheese and one low fat. This didn't decrease the creaminess any! Paired perfectly with the crushed gingerbread cookies still leftover from Christmas. All in all, very very good!

I really wanted this to hit a home run.  I should have read the reviews more carefully.  Next time I will use the cinnamon graham crackers and more spice.  I like the texture, but it was blan.

Made this as an alternative to the Thanksgiving pumpkin pie... even my VERY traditional parents LOVED this... including my Dad who claims not to like cheesecake.  I added a little extra pumpkin to the mis and reduced the temperature a bit to account for the darker pan.  My first cheesecake ever... and no cracks!

This cheesecake rates a 10+ with this household! Followed the recipe to a tee and it looked like a bakery prepared cake and best of all it tasted like a bakery made cake. I don't call myself a wonderful baker but with this recipe I AM a wonderful baker!!!!

I cheated and bought a store-bought crust. I did add ginger in place for the gingersnap cookies and adjusted a few things and it tasted great. Here's what I changed: 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp ground cloves. I also tried to place a pan of water in the oven to increase the humidity but it didn't seem to make a difference with the cracking. May have done it wrong but it didn't matter. The cheesecake turned out great. It was a hit at my house :)

This was the very first Cheesecake I've ever made!  I made it for Thanksgiving this year and it was a TOTAL HIT!      Being this was the first time I made any cheesecake, I read a lot of the reviews and made the following modifications: ADDED about 3/4 teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice, DIDN'T REFRIGERATE the mixture, placed a waterbath in oven while baking then baked at 325 for the first 15, then lowered it to 300 for the remaining 40-45 minutes.    I have to say that for my FIRST cheesecake it came out very well.  If I make it again, (WHICH I MOST LIKELY WILL) I would make the following modifications: Add a tad more butter to the crust.  I found that certain parts of the crust were very crumbly and hard to get to stay up on the walls of the pie dish! Use slightly LESS pumpkin spice.  I really thought that it tasted too much like a pumpkin pie and not enough like a CHEESECAKE and I think I'll try chilling the batter somehow before swirling - It seemed rather runny to me.  Maybe I over-mixed the batter?    ALL IN ALL, GREAT cheesecake!  It was easy to make and everyone liked it!  I'm really excited to try it again!    EDIT:  I forgot to add that I also mixed the Gingersnap cookies with Reduced Fat Nilla cookies and Cinnamon Graham Crackers.  No particular amount of each, just kinda mixed them all together!  It was good!

The cheesecake was good...BUT if you want a normal size cake double the recipe. I was disappointed how little it made and I followed the recipe to a tea.

I would suggest only leaving a half a cup of the swirl mixture because it's hard to get a good marble effect with a whole cup.  too much white.     overall, this was delicious as ever.

This was wonderful!  Very simple to put together, it had a nice consistency.  I think next time i will bake it at a cooler temperature (325) to prevent any cracking on the surface.  I didn't have any ginger snap cookies so I used maple cookies, and the reviews were great. This is going to be added to my repertoire. Serve with caramel sauce to dress it up!

Excellent cheesecake!! I doubled the crust (ran out of gingersnaps but filled the remaining amount needed with graham crackers - tasted great!), and did 1 + 1/2 the filling. It made for a really thick cheesecake. With the extra filling I had to cook it about 20-25 min. longer.  Cooked the entire time in a water bath approximately 1/3 up the side of my 9" pan. It was a huge hit with my dinner guests, including my sister who can't stand cheesecake.  SOOOOOO delicious! The crust was THE BEST!!

Finally got this right!  Have tried to make this several times and, while the taste has been good, it hasn't looked as I wanted.  The first time was the closest; followed the directions exactly (except added extra cinnamon and nutmeg, and added cloves) but had one pretty major crack).

This time, I made the recipe for 18 servings.  Be aware, because while the website will adjust the quantities under "ingredients," you need to do the math when following the "directions" for dividing the sugar.  I cooked it for 60 minutes with a pan of water on the shelf below.  Its perfect and beautiful!  I'm pretty sure its "done" right, so hopefully will taste as good as always!

Simple and tasty cheesecake recipe.  Prepare the filling first and refrigerate while making the crust (this will assist with the marbling effect).  Use 1.5 times the crust recipe, the crust makes the cheesecake so you want it a little thicker than normal.

Two friends and I made this yesterday and it was delicious!  We were actually carving pumpkins and messed up on one, so that's where we got our pumpkin from....I do NOT recommend that!  It's very labor intensive!  But it came out delicious!  I might also recommend baking this over an open flame....we wound up doing that after the butter from the crust came through the pan and onto the bottom of the oven haha.  Bottom line, you will not be disappointed.  And we did the sour cream glaze with vanilla and sugar...terrific!

Wonderful! I loved this recipe! It will probably become a Thanksgiving tradition in our home. I didn't use the gingersnap crust because I didn't have any gingersnaps on hand, and I really love a regular graham cracker crust. I also didn't use a springform pan, simply because I don't own one. I used a 8-9 inch cake pan. I had a little left over batter though. I also baked mine for only 35 minutes or so, but my oven bakes faster than most. This was wonderful, Thank you! If you're a cheesecake lover and a pumpkin lover, you've got to try this!

Delicious cheesecake.  I made a graham cracker crust, but added sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon ginger to the crust.  And the only changes I made to the filling were to add 1/2 teaspoon ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon cloves with the cinnamon.  And I topped it with a sour cream glaze (sour cream with sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla, spread on top of the hot cheesecake and baked for another 10 minutes).  The leftovers are in the refrigerator, and they're calling me right now!  Mmmm.  Very good.

I was really disappointed in this.  It was too pumpkin-y, and I LOVE pumpkin.  I guess I was expecting more cheesecake and less pumpkin pie.  I was sad that I wasted my efforts on this -- it was almost embarrassing to have brought it to our Christmas party when I'm usually known for such great cooking.

Amazing - I followed some of the other reviewers advice, like adding additional pumpkin pie spice, omitting the nuts, and making the crust with 1/2 gingersnaps and 1/2 cinnamon graham crackers.  I made the recipe serve 18.  I brought it a dinner for six, and half of it was gone at days' end.  Could pumpkin pie get any better?

I think this recipe is a good start for a pumpkin cheesecake.  The consistency was great, however, I would have preferred more of a pumpkin taste.  I will adjust it accordingly next time.  I also don't think the gingersnap crust is necessary.  I will more than likely just use a graham cracker crust next time.

This was my first attempt at a 'cooked' cheesecake. WOW!!! It was SO moist and the flavor was unbelievable! Not too sweet...just right! The gingersnap crust gave it such a nice flavor. I usually don't eat the crust on my cheesecakes, but I gobbled this one up!

This recipe was a big hit with my family, I used the pumpkin pie mix instead of the pumpkin, but it just came out sweeter, so if you like sweets, go with the pumpkin pie mix.

We love this recipe!  My children wanted this instead of traditional pumpkin pie this year.  We use half gingersnaps and half graham crackers and it turns out great.  Once when I didn't have nutmeg I used allspice and it tasted great.

I made this for my family on Thanksgiving, and everybody raved!  I multiplied the recipe by 1/2 because other reviews said it was too thin, and it turned out great. I also added some of the spices suggested by others.  It was so pretty, and tasted great.  I am not a fan of pumpkin pie, but I loved this.  Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it, in fact, they preferred it over the regular pumpkin pie I made.  The only thing I think I will change the next time I make it is I will set aside more plain cheesecake batter.  I really liked the marbled parts with the mixture of both tastes better than just the pumpkin batter parts.  But other than that, a great recipe, thank you for sharing!

This was the best cheesecake, everyone wanted the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 9 1/2" pan and baked for 50 minutes instead of 55, it turned out perfect.

This recipe came out great. It looks and tastes professional! My roommates all ate seconds! I read some of the reviews and tried to follow a couple tips that worked- like making the batter first and storing in the fridge while I made the crust, I did half graham cracker crumbs and half ginger snaps with the pecans in the crust. I also had the cream cheese and eggs room temperature for the batter. I added a heavy 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the batter. I tried to change temperature very slowly and hand stirred everything to reduce air bubbles in the batter. Then I put a tray of water  on the lowest rack while I cooked the cheesecake and didn't open the oven at all until at least 45 mins. When it was finished I let it cool for about 4 hrs before putting it in the fridge. Good luck! Such an easy/fun recipe that looks and tastes great!

Loved by all, children and adults alike!  Tastes just like pumpkin pie with a bit of a cheesecake aftertaste.
My spin: use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/2 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp allspice.  Bake @325F for the given time. Edge with a knife.  Leave sit in oven 1 hour turning oven off and leaving door ajar.  Then rest on counter 1 hour.  Chill 4 hours.
To be fair, I never tried it the other way.  But my way was wonderful.

I loved this recipe. I used a 12"springform pan and will probably double the filling next time. I used a whole can of pumpkin and lots of pumpkin pie spice and clover. The crust was so tasty. Got lots of compliments.

delish!  I made this for Thanksgiving dessert and everyone loved it.  I baked it at 300 for about 40 minutes, but I wish I had checked it a little sooner because I think it was done around 35 minutes.  I used the pan of water trick and let it cool gradual (an hour in the open but turned off oven, an hour on the counter) but it still cracked a little :(  I have yet to make a cheesecake that hasn't cracked.

This pumpkin cheesecake came out great!  I didn't have gingersnaps or pecans for the crust so I used graham crackers and walnuts instead.  The pumpkin flavoring is very subtle, but still really good.  I also used a little less sugar.

I'd never made cheescake before, but this was excellent and turned out beautiful. The ginger cookis crust was a little too much for me, so the second time I used the gingerbread graham crackers and that was much better.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I got so many compliments from family, friends, and coworkers when I made it for Thanksgivings. I made them in a cupcake pan so it was easy to serve and was the perfect portion. Also, I mixed half cinnamon graham crackers with the gingersnaps to make the crust, which was great but I'm sure all gingersnaps would be too. Like others, I added a little extra spice, which I probably could have done more but it was still good.   I also made sure to leave out the cream cheese until it got to room temp, and made the filling first and let it firm up in the fridge before adding to the crust. For my first time making cheesecake, this came out perfect and was surprisingly easy!

Made this as an alternative to pumpkin pie this Thanksgiving. My whole family enjoyed it very much and kept on complimenting how it tasted very similiar to a pumpkin pie but better and "different", but it a good way! I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for the first time yesterday for an early Thanksgiving dinner. I read all of the reviews and it seemed like a sure hit. In the end, I was rather disappointed. My boyfriend is not a huge pumpkin pie fan and I thought making a pumpkin cheesecake would add a nice twist on the dessert that he might enjoy. The result tasted very much like pumpkin pie and other than the crust, tasted nothing like cheesecake IMO...and I LOVE cheesecake. I ended up enjoying it, as did the rest of the dinner guests, but I didn't end up with the delicious and unique holiday dessert I planned to make.

I wanted to bring this to Thanksgiving dinner, but I had no clue how it would taste, so I made a test run for my office. It is really simple and they LOVED it! I left it in the oven a teensy weensy bit too long so when I took it out it rose quite a bit and it was a little browned and you couldn't see the "marble effect". So next time I will stand close by the oven instead of wandering off. Other than that, the cake still came out wonderfully and my cake was the only one that was fully gone at the end of the meal!

Made this for a pumpkin carving party (and made a trial one for the family a week before) and everyone loved it!  I followed the reipe AS IS the first time with a springform pan.  The second time around I decided to use the mini muffin pans and bake for 20-25 minutes (as someone else had suggested in their comment)  Delicious!

Awesome cheesecake!  Have made several times and it's been perfect each time.  And the gingersnap cookies really do make a difference!

I have to say that I was fairly disappointed with this recipe. While it did look very pretty, it tasted far more like a sloppy pumpkin pie than a cheesecake. I should of added some allspice and ginger like others had recommended. There was too much pumpkin batter compared to cream cheese. If I were to try this out again, I would add one more package of cream cheese to the cream cheese mixture and add some more spices. I don't think I will make again.

would be 5 stars if you double the filling. otherwise its pretty thin in a 9in pan. and i had to bake it for an hour before it was close to set which caused the crust to burn because it was prebaked next time ill double the filling and not prebake the crust.

Made some changes--cooked this in a regular 9 inch pie pan. I was worried that it wouldn't come out clean, but it did! After running a knife around the edge, I waited until the cheesecake was room temperature then stuck it in the fridge, still in the pan. The next day, I took it out, turned the pan upside down on a plate, and patted the bottom a couple times. I could hear it unstick. Then, I took another plate and flipped the cheesecake over onto it. The marble design wasn't hurt at all. I used about 2 cups of crushed gingersnap cookies with the same amount of butter; with only 1 1/2 cups, there were gaps in the thin crust. Omitted the pecans because some guests can't have nuts. At first it didn't seem like enough crust, but it was actually perfect. I upped the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon, and added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. YUM! I haven't actually cut a slice of the cheesecake yet, but some of the very bottom fell off when I was taking it out of the pan (it's okay, it's in the middle of the cake and barely noticeable). It was great! Like light pumpkin pie... and the gingersnap crust was absolutely perfect (I, too, had had my doubts about it). I'm only giving this four stars because, it being my first big successful baking project, didn't LOOK perfect (not the recipe's fault, but my own). This is a must try, though--definitely!

This recipe was wonderful!  I used pecan sandie cookies with pumpkin pie spice added.  Took this little baby to work for our Thanksgiving feast and people were eating it before the main meal!  I had to photo copy the recipe because I had so many requests. Thanks so much for sharing.

I had never made a pumpkin cheesecake before and was a little skeptical about how it would turn out! Loved it! The recipe was not two sweet and the pumpkin flavoring just popped out at you right away.  A really good alternative to those who think pumkin pie is too much. The only thing I changed was I omitted the nutmeg- not a fan- and added a pinch of allspice and ginger along with the cinnamon to the pumpkin.  I will also make this for my family when I go home for Christmas!

I personally thought this cheesecake's appearance wasn't the best. It was really thin and it didn't marble at all. I piped whipped cream over it to cover it. However, my sister and all her friends thought this cheesecake was AMAZING. It was gone right away.. there were no leftovers. So I'm giving this a five for taste and a three for apperance. I might try a different pumpkin cheesecake recipe and see how it works out.

I'm hoping someone can help me figure out what I did wrong - I followed the recipe exactly and found 2 things: the top was browned but after 4 hours in the fridge the inside was still a bit runny, and the batter didn't really fill up the pan - the cake was only about 1.5 inches thick. Kind of small. I only glanced through the 70+ reviews and saw everyone rave - didn't see any that made change recommendations to the recipe minus the note to add more spice. What could I have done wrong here? This is my first cheesecake, but I'm a pretty seasoned baker otherwise. Beginners luck?

Delicious! I made this recipe for the first time Christmas Eve. Followed the instructions to a T, except I used a little more butter for mixing the crust (whole stick). I used pure pumpkin and added the spices. I was a little worried about the gingersnap crust, thought it might be a little strong, but the baking process really tones down the flavor. The crust is a really nice complement to the creamy pumpkin flavor. Will make again!

I tried this one last year and it was a disaster. I vowed to never use this recipe again. Then my boyfriend put a thermometer in our oven and I found out it runs 75 degrees hotter than what the knob reads! Long story short, this year it came out perfect, I've got the picture to prove it :), and I can't wait for everyone else to try it tomorrow!

My first ever cheesecake and it was fantastic!  Dad thought the gingersnaps in the crust really made the difference.  Searched lots of pumpkin cheesecake recipes, but i really loved the presentation of the marbled affect.  Plus, i liked how this recipe had "cheesecake parts" and "pumpkin cheesecake parts" instead of just mixing it all together.  It did crack...I'll try a water bath next time, but I cut off the heads of some flowers and stuck them in the crack, just for initial presentation and it was beautiful and autumny!

This cheesecake is wonderful! I made it for my brother's birthday party. He loves pumpkin pie and cheesecake, so this seemed like the perfect combination for him. The only change I made was I used 4 tbs. of butter in the crust instead of 5. It worked really well, and tasted wonderful! One thing that I had a problem with, however, is that there is a little too much of the white filling; the top of the cheesecake was almost covered when I spooned it on, so there wasn't a whole lot of swirl. Next time, I will probably either put some of the white on the bottom of the pan or I will save less than a cup. Even so, I would definately make this recipe again!

This has got to be the best pumpkin cheesecake recipe ever! After reading some of the review I decided to make the 18 serving cheesecake and it made a very beautiful presentation! I followed the recipe word for word minus the crust (I used mostly graham cracker and very few ginger snaps)! I cannot wait to make this  cheesecake again! Everyone raved at how wonderful it was!

I thought it was a great recipe but I added some umph.  I used pine nuts instead of pecans (but that is just because I hate pecans, completely personal), made it into 3 8oz packages of cream cheese, 1 1/12 cups of pumpkin, 1 tsp cinnamon 2 (instead of one) tsp vanilla 1/4 teaspoon allspice, and 1 c whipping cream which I whipped and then folded into the mixture before baking.  It became much less dense and subtly spicier.

This was great!!  This was my 2nd attempt to make a cheesecake.  This was easy.  I followed the suggestions of half graham crackers and half ginger snaps.  I couldn't taste the ginger snaps, next time i will follow the recipe!  I also made the filling first and put in the fridge, worked great.

I read all the reviews before making this and it turned out to be the best cheesecake ever! 
Made the batter first, adding 1tsp of nutmeg, and 1tsp of cinnamon for more flavor and then put the batter in the fridge while the crust baked.  This helped with the marbling.  Also, I only used 1/2C of white batter instead of a full cup.  That seemed to be too much to get a pretty marbling.
Made for my mom's birthday and everyone raved and said I should bring this instead of pumpkin pie to Thanksgiving this year!

This was the first cheesecake I ever made.  I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  The marbleling is so easy and looks so professional.  The secret is in the crust, I used my blender to crunch up all the cookies and nuts.

This recipe is wonderful. I recieved so many compliments, it will become a regular. I put brown sugar in the food processor with the pecans and gingersnaps to make the crust then added melted butter...it was heavenly :) I also made it in a smaller size cheesecake pan and it was the perfect size and thickness. I did nothing different with baking instructions except leaving in the oven with the temp off and the oven door cracked for about 15 minutes after baking was completed and it didn't crack at all. Thanks for this recipe.

I was all excited about this one - pumpkin and cheesecake, yum. But I was not thrilled with it. My husband was not impressed, either, but he's partial to the NY Cheesecake recipe from AllRecipes I got years ago. I don't know, perhaps I'll try it again. Maybe I'll try merging the NY recipe with the pumpkin.

This turned out really tasty -- was a hit at Thanksgiving. Cheesecake is so good for events like that because it slivers so nicely into smaller slices (unlike cherry pie, which turns into a mess). Everyone was able to try a bit that way. 

I doubled the crust recipe, which helped, but I didn't do a very good job of making a sharp corner at the edges of the pan, so the crust was too thick at the bend. Next time I might just do 1.5x the crust recipe and pay more attention to making the thickness consistent.

It's always a guessing game as to how many ground up cookies will make a crust. I bought a 14oz bag of archway gingersnaps and this was perfect for doubling the recipe to 2 cups.

The marbling was pretty cool, but I think a cup of the leftover white batter was a bit too much to preserve an even blending of orange/white. Next time I'd set aside only 3/4 cup of the white for swirling in at the end.

Highly recommend this recipe.

Creamy and delicious!  I was careful to take mine out after 50 minutes to avoid overbaking.  Otherwise, this was made exactly as written.
The gingersnap crust is great but next time, I'll toast my pecans before putting them into the crust mixture for a nuttier flavor and more crunch.
My family literally argued over who would get the last piece.  Even the crumbs were gone.

This cheesecake turned out wonderful. I took the advice from some of the others who made this and added a 1/2 tsp of allspice and also doubled the gingersnap crust. It looked great! Thanks and enjoy

I won first place in a company bake-off with this incredible recipe.  Beautiful presentation and as delicious as it looks! The only variation to the original recipe was that I replaced the 1/4 tsp. nutmeg with 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. Aside from that I followed the recipe exactly with outstanding results.

This was really good for my first cheesecake.  It did come out a little flat though.  I wonder if I need to double it for a higher cheesecake.  The taste was really good though and everyone liked it.

I just made this recipe for Christmas dinner and thought it turned out terrific.  All I did different from the recipe was add a couple extra shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg and combine ginger snaps with graham crumbs for the crust.  Everything else went exactly according to directions, including the baking time (50 minutes).  Even the marbling turned out easily with no runny mess at all (though the contrast is not stark, it still looked beautiful).  I had nothing but rave reviews from my whole family! Thanks for the great recipe!

The marbling texture was lost pretty fast.  I should have read the reviews that called for refrigerating the batter first.  The gingersnap crust was delicious and easy to make in the food chopper, but did get a little too crispy at the edges.  I would not bake it as long.  Otherwise, a very easy and delicious recipe!

I always make a pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving.  This last year I decided to try this even though I don't like gingersnaps at all.  The crust was awesome!!!  The ginger taste was very suttle and everyone commented on how it seemed like my cheesecake this year was better than before.

Excellent cheesecake.  I've made t the last several Thanksgivings and it gets raves. I make in a water bath and it seems to help reduce cracking.  Definitely make the pecan-gingersnap crust...it makes all the difference.

Very very good!  Definitely use the gingersnap crust...it adds great flavor.  I whirled the gingersnaps in my blender for fast chopping.  I think next time I make this, I'll increase the amount of all the filling stuff by 1/2....the cheesecake was a little thin.  With a dollop of whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel syrup on the plate and the cake, and a couple of sugar coated pecans (recipe on this site, awesome!) on top, it was fabulous!  Even the non-pumpkin eaters enjoyed it a lot!

I may add a pinch of cloves next time, but this is very good.  The gingersnap crust really makes the recipe and a drizzle of caramel syrup over the top is a nice touch. A squirt of whipped cream is pretty good too :-)

I made this for a Halloween potluck, and it was fantastic.  I did make a few revisions.  Because it was for a "Scary Food" themed potluck, I served it with 3 or 4 white and brown Chocolate Mice (recipe on this site) on top and sprinkled a few chocolate sprinkles around them for mouse droppings.  The decorations and the wonderful taste and texture of the cheesecake were terrific!

I lightly toasted the chopped nuts, before adding them to the crust.  For the filling, I used 1/2 non-fat cream cheese, and 1/2 regular cream cheese.  During the baking, I followed the suggestions of the AllRecipes staff and other reviewers by putting a pan of boiling water under the cheesecake, and turning off the heat and leaving the cheesecake in the oven to cool, once it was only jiggly in the center 4 or 5 inches.  It kept it from cracking, and the cheesecake had a WONDERFUL creamy texture.  Thanks for sharing!

I ended up having to use more butter in the crust to get the crumbs to stick together properly.  Also, it might be a good idea to turn the oven off once baking time is up, and allow the cheesecake to cool gradually in the oven to prevent cracking.  The pumpkin got a little watery during baking and leaked into the bottom of my oven -- watch out for this!  It turned out wonderfully and was a hit at my company Thanksgiving luncheon!  Very pumpkin-y!

I like this recipe because it is a great and not overly sweet cheesecake.  The gingersnap crust really makes it special. I didn't do too well with the marbling, but it didn't seem to make a difference.  It was still pretty!

I expected more from this recipe, given the rave reviews.  It was very thin, and I didn't like the flavor much at all.  It was also overcooked at the end of 55 minutes.  I used a waterbath, and still got minimal cracking due to the overcooking.  I think we'll try adding pumpkin to our tradition cheesecake recipe (Chantal's New York Cheesecake-from this site) next time.  It has better flavor and looks much nicer.  I do have to compliment the crust, though, as it was very flavorful.

I made this recipe for my sister's birthday cake since she does not like traditional birthday cake.  This is a great recipe for Fall.  The crust is also an anger management tool (crushing the gingersnaps and pecans).  I felt much less stressed after making the crust!

Mine did not turn out very pretty. I had to leave it at home rather than taking it to Thanksgiving. It was probably the cook, not the recipe.  I might attempt this recipe again next year.

It's really good, just make sure that you crush the cookies enough for the crust.  Also, don't burn the crust, it can ruin the dessert!

I loved this but I did add more spices (1t. cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and allspice). I cooked at 325 in a water bath but it still cracked s but so not sure the water bath is necessary.

Tastes great!! Only issue is it does not specify what size can of pumpkin purée. I used the large one and it turned out very creamy. Not a bad thing but would of loved a more cheesecake texture. Next time I'll try the small can or half. Definitely loved the ginger snap crust and will use it again!!!

Made this cheesecake for my son-in-law's birthday.  The flavor was wonderful and it marbles just like the photo so looks beautiful too!  I chose to do a simple graham cracker crust instead of the gingersnap and it was delicious.  The only issue I had was that it doesn't make a very DEEP cheesecake.  The filling is about 1- 1 1/4" high, very shallow for a cheesecake, I thought.  That's the only reason I am not rating it a 5.   Next time, I will double the filling recipe and use the amount I'd like to create a higher dessert layer and therefore, a few more servings too.  It will be one of my Thanksgiving desserts this year ~ and perhaps become a tradition in our house!  Aunt Tilly

This was my very first attempt at homemade cheesecake, and it was a HUGE success! I made two for Thanksgiving.  I brought one to my parents' and one to my in-laws', and there were no leftovers at either house! I cut back a little on the ginger snaps--I used half graham crackers.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent cheesecake. I did increase the cream cheese, eggs and spices, but I especially liked the crust. I hadn't used gingersnaps to make crust before, but was surprised how flavorful it really was! Definitely will make this one again!

I made this gluten free but using gf ginger snaps! Everyone loved it. I followed other's advice about adding more spices. Yum! It's definitely better than pumpkin pie. I will definitely make this one again.

First time cheesecake maker here.   I made this dessert as requested by my niece and this was delicious!!!  I had to take a lot of grief from my family for taking 2 slices home with me (too stuffed for dessert).  I followed the recipe but I did follow the advice from others and added extra cinnamon, nutmeg and a couple of sashes of pumpkin pie spice too taste.  Marveled beautiful.  Only had1 small crack after baking for 55minutes.   I also set a pan of water on the bottom shelf and used all room temp ingredients.  I also kept the oven at a consistent temperature--no peeking.  Inext time, I may cut the back time back to 45 minutes as my crust started to burn (in my opinion) but then again I have never eaten a cheesecake with a ginger snap crust.  I bought 2 different brands of ginger snap cookies and after tasting them, decided to go with the Archway ginger snap cookie, a "spicier". Cookie.  Another thing I should mention is that I forgot to use the last 1/4 cup of sugar that was called for in the recipe.  The pie was still sweet and no one seemed to notice the  forgotten sugar.  I also used reduced fat cream cheese.  
A few more pointers, I did let the cheesecake "cool" in the oven for a hour-with door ajar.  I then removed from oven -ran a knife around the side of my pan and let the cheesecake continue to cool on the countertop for another hour before refrigerating overnight.  Delicious, delicious...everyone raved over just how delicious this was!   Thank you for sharing!

I made it exactly as suggested and it came out perfectly.  I have made it twice now and it's always a hit. I did make my own cinniman whipped cream and that is pretty amazing on top. Otherwise, it's a great recipe. :-)

This recipe was so easy! I had never made anything using pumpkin so I added a little more brown sugar and treated it as if I was using sweet potato instead of pumpkin! My coworkers loved it! I made a glaze using white sugar, brown sugar, heaving whipping cream and pecans.

I've made this twice and am in the process of doing it again!  It was like magic -- it disappeared in front of my eyes!  Tastes great -- even to family members not sold on pumpkin!  I have gotten cracks both other times, so am trying some of the fixes suggested by other members.  No one saw it long before it was gone anyway, so … no biggie -- just top with some whipped cream.

Did anyone else have issues with the crust having too much butter? The butter dripped out all over my oven. What did I do wrong with that?!
Other than that it turned out fantastic and it was my first cheesecake!

I don't often give a full star rating, but I honestly couldn't find anything I didn't like about this recipe.  I did my own crust with cinnamon graham crackers because its what I had on hand.  I used ginger and a bit of mulling spice instead of the nutmeg and it was lovely!  It's light and flavorful and I will make this again (and again).

I've made this 5 or 6 times and always a hit, wrecked it once using spreadable cream cheese by accident, also make sure it's canned pumpkin and not pie filling, important if someone else is picking up the groceries for u!!

Thumbs up from the turkey filled crew around the table!  The ginger snaps gave a nice flavor to the crust.  We spun up a bowl of cinnamon whipped cream and sprinkled some toasted sugar salted pecans over top of it all.  We'll do this one again next year!

This was a scrumptious desert on Thanksgiving and provided a change for the more traditional pumpkin pie.  However, I would highly recommend for the gingersnap crust to either purchase one or crumble the cookies in advance.  What I did was use a heavy duty sandwich bag and a rolling pin to crumble them about 6-8 cookies at time.

I've never written a review until now. This is a terrific recipe! I couldn't find any pecans in the grocery store, so I substituted finely chopped walnuts in the gingersnap crust which was phenomenal! I doubled the recipe to take to a Thanksgiving gathering and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. I generally add a little less sugar than dessert recipes call for and have never had a complaint yet. I also omitted the ginger just because I didn't have any. The top did crack in a few places because I couldn't figure out how to do a water bath for a 9 x 13 pan, but naturally that didn't change the taste. I thought it tasted a great deal like pumpkin pie with a hint of cream cheese.

Wow!  So easy , so pretty and SO tasty!  The only thing I changed was that I used walnuts instead of pecans for the crust.  I pulsed the ginger snaps and walnuts together in my food processor for a smooth crumb.  And I listened to the others and put that 1 cup of plain mix into the fridge to firm up before swirling in to the pumpkin mixture.  It worked like a charm.  I also lined the bottom and sides of my springform pan with parchment paper.  It made it easy to pull away from the pan and then I peeled off the paper.  It looks like a professionally made cheesecake!  Excellent recipe!

I made this cheesecake for a dinner party and it was a big hit!  However, next time I will either double the recipe or leave it in the mixer longer to fluff up a bit (as another reviewer suggested) because it seemed a little thin.  Also, I plan to use a little less butter in the crust.  Be mindful when marbling the top because it creates a gorgeous design when baked, I tried to do a leaf.

I normally try a new recipe exactly as listed then make any changes, but when a recipe calls for pumpkin flavors I always double the amount. This cheesecake was delicious. The only other change I might make would be to add a little sour cream to the mixture. It was a little dryer than I like. I want that creamy smooth texture to my cheesecake.

I really liked it. I am not the biggest fan of ginger snaps, but did not find the ginger snap crust overwhelming at all.  I did add in some extra cinnamon, nutmeg, and added cloves. It was still pretty mild.  For whipped topping, I made whipped cream - 1c heavy cream, 2tbsp icing sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and a sprinkling of cinnamon and cloves. Was delicious.

Wonderful, only suggestion I would make is to make 1.5 times the filling, i like my cheesecake a little thicker, other then that, that taste was wonderful!

This was delicious. The gingersnap crust can be adapted to other cheesecake recipes as well as it really does add an additional flavour dimension. As an extra decadent touch I poured Dolce de Leche on top to finish (put an unopened can of sweetened condensed milk in water and boil for 2 hours). For those ultra pumpkin lovers, this recipe can do for an extra 1/2 Cup of pumpkin.

This turned out beautifully! I made it for a birthday gathering and everyone loved it. Even a few who aren't into Pumpkin Pie. haha Only thing I did differently, was use 1/2 Graham crackers and 1/2 Ginger snaps for the crust. Great recipe!

A show stopper--outstanding!! I let the mixer run longer than suggested and the result was a light soufflé-like texture. I did not use the water pan and had a small crack when it was done. Also did not bother to marble it due to time press.

Was pretty good, but I am an avid cheesecake maker and this wasn't my favorite recipe. It went over very well at my family's Thanksgiving get together, but some commented that the crust was a little much.  Maybe just the typical graham cracker crust would work a little better here.

This is my second time making this pumpkin cheesecake.  I don't marble it, though.  The ginger snap crust makes a huge difference.  Also, I place my spring form pan in a larger pan with water when I bake it.  It's not in the recipe, but I have always done that with cheesecake and it came out fine (no cracks, either).

This is a GREAT recipe!! I've made it several times now, and my family loves it!! I do make a few modifications: for the crust, I use 1 cup graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup crushed vanilla wafers, 1 teaspoon ginger and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg instead of the ginger snaps. I use Splenda in place of white sugar (for the diabetics in my family) and I use clear Mexican vanilla extract (it has the BEST flavor of any vanilla extract I've ever tried! Wal-Mart sells it in the ethnic foods section). Instead of canned pumpkin, I use butternut squash. I cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, and bake at 350 degrees until it is tender (usually just over an hour, depending on how many squash I cook at once) then I scoop out the insides of the squash and use a blender, food processor, or hand mixer to get it to a consistency resembling canned pumpkin before measuring it out and adding to the other ingredients. After the cheesecake is baked and cooled, I use a cake decorator to put daubs of Sugar Free Cool Whip all over the top of the cheesecake (this makes the dessert more party-friendly, and eliminates the need to set out Cool Whip and extra serving utensils with this dish!) Then I sprinkle finely chopped pecans over the Cool Whip. Everyone loves it and always requests the recipe!!

AWESOME. I've never made a cheesecake this good before. I did add a LOT more spice, like everyone suggested, and refridgerated the batter for only about 20 minutes so it created a wonderful swirl. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I think I'll be making this a holiday tradition.

Wow this Cheesecake came out beautiful and tasted great.  I did not have gingersnaps so I used graham crackers and it was wonderful.  Next time I will try the gingersnaps.  This will now be a Thanksgiving standard.  I also scaled it to 16 (and used a 10" springform pan) and was glad because we had very little left and were happy for the little leftovers we had. If you scale it to 16 you don't really haveto adjust the crust. I did and had a little more crust than I would have liked.  We prefer a thin crust.

This is a great recipe! I made it for thanksgiving and my family devowerd it. I was serving and before I knew it, it was all gone. My family loves chocolate but my brother married someone who does not like chocolate. So I made this and it pleased everyone.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was my first crack at a homemade cheesecake. It went over REALLY well! The family raved and I don't think it was all that difficult. The only problem I had was actually getting the swirl going on without actually mixing instead. Eh, practice makes perfect, I guess. Thanks for sharing! I will definitely be making this one again.

Loved this dessert!  Not as rich and filling as cheesecake, but not quite a pie either.  A family favorite.

it was great....everyone loved it! I did take the advice of another review and added some pumpkin spice to it which I got the recipe for off here! Topped with whipped cream and crushed pecans, it looked like a store bought one!

excellent!!! ive been asked several times to make this for family gatherings, and was complemented on the crust, i used half graham cracker and half gingersnap cookies and walnuts instead of pecans (because its what i had and its cheaper) other then that i followed the recipe to a T and it's a huge hit with everyone that's tried it. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty and easy to make.  Melt in your mouth.  I used half gingersnap cookies and half graham crackers, but I think next time I will used just ginger snap to make the flavor stronger.  I would recommend crushing the cookies very small so that it is easier to press into the pan.  I also added extra spices like others and it was great!  Thanks so much!

Everyone loved this cheesecake!  I did use a water bath, after wrapping the bottom of my pan in foil to prevent leaks.  There was some water inside the foil when I took it off, so I worried the crust would be soggy, but it was perfect.  No cracks, very pretty and tasty.

This was really delish.  Although there wasn't as much filling as I'd like, but the flavor was great, I may try to make more filling next time.  But other than that it was great.

This was my first time making a cheesecake, so naturally I was a bit apprehensive. This recipe is easy to execute and delicious. It was the hit of the party and everyone asked me for the recipe. I highly recommend it.

I made this for a Bake Sale.  I made it into cupcakes instead in the jumbo cupcake foils and they came out amazing!  They were the first thing to sell out.  I took other people's suggestions and put more pumpkin than suggested and the cupcakes only took about 30 minutes to be done.  I'm planning to make this again for Christmas.

This cheesecake was easy to make and was pretty good. It definitely needs a little more spice and is best when served with cool whip.  I tried a slice 1 day after making it and it was OK.  I tried another slice after it sat for almost 2 days and it was SOO much better.  Moral of the story, make this pie 1-2 days in advance.  I will be making it for Thanksgiving this year!

This was good! The crust was a bit over done, but maybe that's my oven. Next time I'll omit pre-baking the crust or turn it down just a bit. Tasty, fairly easy, I'll make it again!

This was my first cake ever and I made it for thanksgiving. I followed the recipe and it was quite a user friendly one and it looked amazing. I found the first bite to be a strange one but I liked it more and more with each bite. \brought it into work and it was almost all gone. The only critique I got was it was a touch too sweet for one person. After looking through the reviews, I want to try it cupcake style and I like the half and half idea and will also try a graham cracker crust. Thanx for the recipe and making my first real baking experience a good one!

I made a recipe similar to this a long time ago...after searching all the recipes this one seemed to be the one I was looking for.  I made three cheesecakes for Thanksgiving this year and after reading the other reviews I used some of their suggestions and they turned out beautiful!! For one of the cakes I omitted the gingersnap cookies and pecans then I only used only graham crackers due to food allergies (to nuts).  I used a water bath to prevent cracking which it did marvelously and I did not chill the filling at all. The marble effect turned out great too!  Will be making this again for Christmas I'm sure.  Thanks!!!

I made this recipe using low-fat cream cheese and egg beaters and no one at the restaurant where I work could tell it was a "light" version.  It is very good and not too sweet, just the right amount of sweetness!

I made this cheesecake and it was a bit too sweet for me, but my co-workers liked it. I was also disappointed that my crust got soggy after I baked it with the filling. I did; however, share the gingersnap crust idea with my sister's friend who had used grahm crakcers with her's originally and she loved the new alternative.

I love this recipe and make it almost every thanksgiving. I will admit i get mixed reviews on the crust. I think you either love it or hate it. I also chill the batter before putting in pan.

This is a great recipe! I gave it 4 stars only because you have to double the cream cheese to get the height.

This recipe was so easy! The texture of the cheesecake was nice and dense, it was so delicious! 
Next time I will only reserve 1/2 cup or so of the mixture to make the "swirly" part. A cup seemed to be a little too much.  I added a little more spice than called for in the recipe, but i just eyed it not any specific measurement.

so festive!  I made this for our Thanksgiving dessert and it was quite a hit.  turned out very well with only 1 small crack, which I think happened because I didn't run a knife around the edge before I shut the oven off and let it cool for an hour.  lesson learned.  next time I will consider holding back less batter for the "plain" swirling part, the whole cup of batter was too much on top of mine (I used an 8.5" springform pan) and I didn't quite get the marbled top I wanted.  still tasted great.  I'd also recommend refrigerating the separate layers for the cleanest marbling effect.   thanks for sharing!

I made this in gold foil cupcake holders. It was perfect for a party! I followed the recipe, but after baking and cooling I topped each mini-cheesecake with chocolate cinnamon ganache. I also made some spiced pumpkin seeds, and put 2-3 on top of each mini-cheesecake for garnish. They looked beautiful! I wish I had taken a picture.

This cheescake was delicious and everyone loved it!... I gave it 5 stars because of it's flavor;I was sorry to see it cracked all around the outer rim tho.   I also agree with the other reviews... 1 cup of white filling was too much to take out for the marble design.  Second time I've made it I cut it down to 1/3 cup and it was just the right amount to add some swirl to the top!  :)

Great recipe, not as overly rich as standard cheescake. I took suggestion of diluting snaps with nilla wafers, it worked great.

Both times that I made this cheesecake, I got rave reviews. Everyone loved it, including me. I thought the light texture was really great. I used graham crackers instead of gingersnaps and pecans. It worked just fine. I also made this once in a mini muffin tin, and it was great. They cooked for about 15 mins at 350 and were great. The miniature size made it perfect for a get together.

Really great, easy cheesecake. I made this last night for my husbands birthday and it was beautiful. The crust is amazing, worth the extra effort. I only had a 8 inch pan and it worked great. Next time I may use 3 cream cheeses just to get a taller cake. This is a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe, easy to make and really tasty. I had never made a cheese cake before and it was so easy. I used the blender to crumble the cookies to make the crust. Everyone loved it.

Got an almost identical recipe from Kraft.  The only changes were that the filling called for 3 eight ounce packages of cream cheese instead of two and added a dash of ground cloves to the other seasonings.  YUM!  This is excellent, very easy to make.  Just watch your baking times - I only baked mine for 39 minutes, and was surprised to find it done already.

This one is a keeper! I added one additional tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I reduced the cup set aside to only half a cup but I think next time, I will do 3/4 cup. I put the batter in the fridge for about 20 minutes before I did the swirling. I did fine with the crust but doubling the crust would give you more to work with. It is a very short cheesecake which I didn't mind but doubling the whole recipe would make it taller. I didn't do the water bath but I didn't get any cracks either. Will definitely make again!

Delicious pie, my only complaint is that it was very rich and heavy...but that's not really even a complaint because that's exactly what cheesecake is! The marble looks gorgeous and bakery-quality.  This didn't last long, it disappeared in a few hours!

Amazing! I was nervous about baking this especially because my husband had high expectations, but it turned out great. I took it out when the middle was still a little jelloy. I also had a pan of water in the oven with the cheesecake and it didn't crack at all. I thought it was better after it had been totally cooled. 

I'll be making this again.

Delicious!  I swapped out 1/4 c. of the white sugar with brown and only used 2 eggs.  It was so tasty and very attractive.  Perfect alternative to traditional pumpkin pie on my Thanksgiving table.

Phenomenal! Turned out perfectly. I made just one small change and cut the amount of batter I took out in half- swirling came out great. Perfect for the holidays- received many raves. Would recommend serving with a caramel sauce.

Made this for Thanksgiving - giving it five stars for the taste.  However, the crust had way too much butter.  I would usually reduce the butter in any recipe to make it healthier but actually followed the recipe since I was taking it to a party.  Luckily, I put a pan of water on the shelf below the cheesecake, because it caught some of the melted butter that leaked out of the springform pan.  It ended up tasting fine - I think it still seemed crunchy because of the nuts.  I used the 18 serving measurements, and the size of the cheesecake was perfect.  I also just mixed everything together (in the order from the recipe but, when it says 1/2 cup sugar, I put it all in) to save time.  It did crack a little despite the pan of water, but no one cared.  It tasted great and was one of the few desserts eaten when everyone was stuffed.

The pie tastes good (I made it with brown sugar instead of white), but the top burned badly, and I had to peel it off. Perhaps the recipe should suggest covering the top of the pie with foil while baking.

Awesome!  It got several "best pumpkin cheesecake I've ever had" reviews from my friends.  A couple notes: I added some extra Pumpkin Pie spice and one cup of reserved mixture was too much to do the marbling effect.

I thought it was great, I am not a pro cook or anything and I found the recipe easy to follow and make! the Cheesecake turned out perfectly! I followed the tips that someone else posted about making the crust AFTER the filling so that it has time to chill. I didn't find that it helped the swirling at all, you couldn't tell it was marbled at all. I am definetly making again, the only thing I will do differently is make twice the crust, I didn't have enough to go up the sides, and I like it thick anyway. Everyone liked it at Thanksgiving dinner tho!

This cheesecake was delicious!  I used gingerbread graham crackers and the crust came out really great!  Guests at Thanksgiving were skeptical, but I ended having to make another one a few days later since it went so fast!

My girlfriend has made this twice.  The first time it was very good; I'm not a huge cheesecake eater, but it was very good.  The second time I forgot to take it out of the oven when I was supposed to, so make a note that if you leave it in for 2 hours at 350 degrees, it's not going to turn out very well.  Sorry Amy! :(

Great recipe. Very easy to make and fool proof! I didnt have ginger snaps or nutmeg, but the recipe turned out great! 
The crust was a little too thick for my liking, so next time I will probably use less graham crackers. I also added a little pumpkin spice to the crust! It turned out great!

I doubled the recipe and used 4 eggs instead of 6.

This came out perfect and was a big hit! I used many of the suggestions in the reviews like refridgerate the batter, cut the ginger cookies in half, putting a tin of water in the oven ( very minor crack), use a chop stick to do the marbling, etc. I also used a 9" pan and it came out thick and beautiful.

About the marbeling effect; don't get too hung up on it. once you have spooned the regular batter on the pumpkin batter, just lighty swirl the top once or twice. 

I would have included a photo, but it was eaten before I had a chance. This recipe is a keeper!!

This is super duper yumarific. I didn't do the gingersnap crust. I just don't like the snaps, but I did use vanilla wafers and cinamon graham crackers crushed together. I would melt the butter next time to make the crust instead of softening it. It wasn't really "marblized" and I left out more just cheesecake batter than recommended, but the pumpkin cheesecake part was great!

tasted amaaazing everyone raved about this cheesecake

the crust didnt bake well, either increase the gingersnap or decrease the butter amount.
also instead of pulling out a cup of batter pull out a little less so it will swirl better

Fantastic recipe!!! The only problem I had with this was finding gingersnaps!!! I went to 6 stores before I found them lol. But make sure you use gingersnaps because they made the cheesecake as good as it was. I also did the same as another person (the picture on the recipe) and had the crust come up high. It turned out great that way. This had a perfect pumpkin flavor. It almost tasted like a creamy pumpkin pie. 

Thanks for the great recipe!! My family thanks you!!

I made the changes other reviewers suggested: made filling first to refrigerate while I made the crust, definitely used gingersnaps (yum!), added extra spices to batter (cloves, ginger), mixed batter a little longer to fluff, put pan with water into oven with cheesecake to avoid cracks, increased pumpkin by 1/2 cup (this may have made the cake more creamy- almost too creamy in my opinion).  It had good pumpkin flavor by doing that, but as I said the texture wasn't my favorite.  I prefer a slightly drier cheesecake.  It stayed marbled after refrigerating, but a corner got too brown and therefore masked the marbling.  I would rotate pan 3/4 of the way through baking next time.  It baked in less than 45 minutes in a 9X9 square stoneware pan.

I brought this to 2 different parties and everyone loved it!  I did take the suggestion to add more spices, I also added a bit more pumpkin.  I used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it turned out great!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and used light cream cheese and splenda since I like to make things healthy. Nobody could tell the difference.  Great cheesecake!It was all gone.

I like pumpkin pie, and I like cheesecake, but I didn't care for this pumpkin cheesecake. The gingersnap was a little too 'snappy' for me, I think. It overpowered the rest.

This recipe is absolutely gorgeous and makes a cheesecake that is really creamy and has an almost whipped light texture.  I did have to make it with cooked fresh pumpkin (not canned) as it's really difficult to find here in England.  This might have made the texture lighter. I will make this recipe for many years to come - a real winner!  Thanks!

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious!  The gingersnap crust really does make a difference.  I'll use that on other cheesecakes.  I agree with others that the batter is runny, particularly before you add the pumpkin.  When I tried to marble, all I did was mix it up, there was very little marbling.  Didn't matter though, it was still outstanding.  Maybe next time, I'll try to layer as someone suggested.  Thanks!!

This cheesecake is SOOOO good!! It looks beautiful and the crust is unusual as well as absolutely delicious. I followed others' advice and did the following: added a little more spice (just taste the batter till it's how you like it) made it in a 9" glass pan; added a little more sugar to the pumpkin batter; baked at 350 for

It was my first time making cheesecake and it was so easy and came out great! I definitely want to make it again!
I used graham cracker crust and baked at 350 for the first 15 minutes and then 300 for the other 40 minutes.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it so much I have been asked to make it again.   My husband's grandmother even had me make one for her card club.  I was told the ladies all loved it.
My son (17 months at the time) loved crushing the gingersnaps.

It was okay. My coworkers didn't like the crust and I wasn't a huge fan either. The pumpkin could be a little stronger...maybe with pumpkin pie spice. Also...a very flat cheesecake...it didn't rise hardly at all.

OMG this was WONDERFUL!!  I had no problems with it being thin or not tasting good.  It was absolutely outstanding and one of the easiest cheesecakes I have ever made.  Have to admit I cheated on the crust and just bought one from the store.  I am not really a crust person.

Two problems with this recipe. The ginger snaps always get  overdone. I wouldn't recommend cooking the crust first. Better yet, use shortbread cookie crumbs with a pinch of nutmeg. Skip the pecans. Much better taste. Secondly, and more important, the cheesecake always cracks. It's because there is such a difference in the consistency of the two batters. The plain cheesecake batter is much thicker than the one with pumpkin. I tried adding cornstarch to the pumpkin one after I take out the 1 cup of plain batter. It helped a little but still cracked. I've  tried it with and without a water bath. Still cracks. Don't get me wrong, it tastes fantastic! But presentation is very important, especially at holiday dinners.

I followed the directions to the letter except for the crust. I used gluten free ginger snaps. Otherwise exactly. It looked beautiful when I put it in the oven. In 50 min I checked on it, and the top was almost burnt. I was so upset since it was for company. I had no choice but to serve it. It said to bake for 55 minutes. When I cut into it, there were no swirls! It had separated into a bottom pumpkin layer and cheesecake layer. Next time I will put the cheesecake on the bottom and swirl the pumpkin on top it would definitely work better and not bake it at 350, but at 325.

Easy and always delicious.  Have made it several times, always a crowd-pleaser and an attractive presentation.  I do always place a pan of hot water on the rack below it in the oven to prevent cracking....works every time!  Thanks, Renee'!

This recipe is excellent.  I made the recipe exactly as listed, no alterations or changes to ingredients.  I placed a pie tin with water on the bottom shelf of oven, baked cheesecake for 55 minutes (it was slightly jiggly in center), turned oven off, propped door open about 2", and left in oven to cool. Ran knife around edges, then refrigerated overnight.   No cracks, was marbled beautifully, and cut in perfect clean slices.  I made this for a family dinner -  everyone commented on how tasty it was and it was gone by the time the last guest left.  The pumpkin flavor was just perfect - light and delicate, not too spicy, did not need any additional spices.  The white was intermixed beautifully with the orange pumpkin part (I did swirls with a butter knife, careful not to damage crust).  This is a keeper, I will make again and will not change a thing, and I highly suggest this recipe, exactly as it is written.

No question, this is one of my favorite cheesecake recipes. It's surprisingly easy to make and has a consistently great taste.

This recipe did turn out great for being my first cheesecake, the consistency of the cheesecake was perfect. I did make a couple of adjustments per other reviews. I ended up adding more spice to the mixture, just a little bit more of the spices that the cheesecake already has. I then took another reviewers advice about how to bake it. It turned out beautifully with not a single crack. I preheated the oven to 325, and put a pan of water in the bottom and baked it for 55 minutes. I then shut off the oven, and cracked open the door, and left it in there for another hour, I put it on the counter with a plate on it for an hour, and then chilled it overnight. I did make the crust the way that she wrote, and it turned out great. I didn’t find it to be overpowering, but maybe that’s personal preference. I didn’t chill the mixture before pouring it either and I think that mine ended up marbling nicely. The most important thing in my opinion is room temperature ingredients. I opened up my cream cheese and left it on the wrapper with the eggs beside it will I cooked my dinner. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I made this yesterday for my family’s thanksgiving dinner, and it turned out fantastic!

Changes I did:
I used a pumpkin pie I grew in the garden (had about 3/4C from it) instead of the full cup of pumpkin. I also doubled all the spices, and added 1/2tsp of ground allspice.
Instead of the nuts I just added 1/2 a cup more of the ginger snap cookies. 
I actually finished the filling before the crumbs so I put the batter in the fridge. 
I only had a 10” round spring on so I adjusted cooking times. And to other users suggestions, I put a pie plate full of water on the bottom shelf. It seemed to help the cracking cause the cheesecake didn’t have any cracks until I tested it to see if it was done. 

Turned out fantastic :) This recipe is a keeper!

I didn't deviate from the recipe and I didn't place a pan of water in the oven (although I'll keep this tip in mind next time) and I didn't experience any cracking. I think the gingersnap crust really gives this cheesecake that something extra. I love pumpkin and would have added extra spices per other reviews but my husbands not terribly keen on pumpkin/spice cake. This was my first experience at cheesecake- are they all this easy?? Maybe next time I'll double the recipe...  I just love the look and fullness of a thicker cheesecake.

This is a hit at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The cake itself is good. However, I got a ton of compliments when I got rid of the pecans and added snickerdoodles to the gingersnaps for the crust. People absolutely loved it, and kept asking me what I had done because the crust was so good.

This cheesecake is absolutely delicious! Followed instructions exactly. As others suggested, I slid the knife around the edge of the pan immediately after pulling from the oven and there was no problem removing from the pan. Will make again and again! Thank you Renee!

I normally do not like pumpkin pie spiced anything but my daughter loves pumpkin pie and cheesecake so I made it.  I followed the recipe only adding pumpkin pie spice instead of indidual spices.  The ginger snap crust totally makes this cheescake outstanding! Thanks for sharing.

This is wonderful and not too dense like some cheesecakes are. I used some pumpkin spice binder cookies for the crust without the nuts and that added to the flavor.

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake, and it was a big hit.  My daughter who normally dislikes both pumpkin and cheesecake went back for more.  I think it'll be a T-day tradition now.

I followed everyone else's advice and doubled the spices. This cheesecake was heavenly bliss, and I'm no stranger to making cheesecakes. This is by far the best dang cheesecake I have ever tasted. The gingersnap crust really sets it apart.

This was my first time making a cheesecake and this is a wonderful recipe! I followed all instructions, altho I did add more spice as suggested by others (more cinnamon, all spice etc.) I put a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven and the cheesecake cooked beautifully. I had no issues marbling the filling without refrigeration. Had a great flavor, the pecans in the crust really stood out. Great autumn dessert- thank you!

Excellent cheesecake recipe!  I made one small change -- the first time I made it, I found the batter a little too runny when trying to swirl the two flavours before baking.  I have solved that issue by using 2 eggs instead of 3.  Now my cheesecake is perfect!

Everyone loved it when I made it. I used cinnamon graham crackers instead of ginger snaps. And instead of canned pumpkin I used a baking pumpkin and mashed it myself. An excellent recipe.

I really liked the crust. I ran the pecans through the food processor to make them fine. I think it called for more butter in the crust than needed. The cheesecake had a good taste to it but for a 9 inch pan spring form pan it didn't have much height. I will keep looking for the perfect Christmas cheesecake.

So this was my first cheesecake that I made, it turned out pretty good! The crust burnt a bit after I made it and the marbling didn't turn out as good as it could have but it was still pretty good! It was really overpowering with the pumpkin and I messed up on the nutmeg and the cinnamon but it was really good! I made it into bars but it was tasty!

Delicious! Super creamy and not too sweet. We used gluten free ginger snaps to make the recipe gluten free.

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving get-together! Will definitely make again. Since I was feeding some with grain-free diets, I substituted the gingersnap crust for a completely nut crust: 1-1/2 c. pecans, chopped, 1/4 c. sugar, 1/3 c. melted butter. Mix & bake as in the recipe. Hint: place a cookie sheet beneath the springform pan when baking the crust. Mine always leaks some melted butter out & makes a big smoky mess in the oven.

I used 1/2 ginger snaps and 1/2 vanilla wafers after reading the reviews. The edge got a little browner than I would have liked, and part of the crust was slightly burned, so next time I'll reduce the cooking by about 10 minutes and watch it.

Next time I think I'll also decrease the amount of cream cheese mixture with the pumpkin/spice mixture, so the color variation comes out a little more distinct. I may also try adding pumpkin pie spice, although I'm not a fan of pumpkin by itself really, so the mildness of that didn't bother me.
I brought the pie for a Thanksgiving potluck at work and, my perceived flaws with it aside, it went quickly and I got fantastic reviews. It was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely make it again. Thank you for this wonderful recipe! :)

Loved this cake! Super user friendly. I made it for a team friendsgiving, and it was a huge success. Ew changes:
Make way ahead of time, there is a lot of sitting! 
The marbled affect worked for me without refrigerating before hand, but make sure you mix well with electric mixer so there are no chunks. 
Add lots of spices to pumpkin mix! I used pumpkin pie spice from whole foods which was so yummy. 
Will definitely make again!

Although this did taste good, it is not cheesecake. It has more the consistence of pumpkin pie. I would make it again for the flavor, but not the effect of a pumpkin pie.

Very nice cake, love the ginger snap crust. Like others, I add more cinnamon and also pumpkin pie spice. I swirled in some melted chocolate, a trick I learned from a different cheesecake recipe.  Will definitely make this again.

I mostly followed the recipe. The only things I changed was I omitted the pecans from the crust and I used the pumpkin purée with the spices already in it! It turned out delicious!!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to try it.  As per reviewers' suggestions, I added more of the spices than the recipe called for. I also added just a pinch of cloves.  Everything else was exactly the same.  I did put a 9x13 glass pan full of water on the bottom rack and allowed the cheesecake to cool in the oven for an hour and a half with the oven off, as other reviewers suggested. It came out so perfect with no cracks! Thank you to all who added suggestions! Definitely a keeper!

It was excellent! Best cheesecake I've ever made. I used the whole can of pumpkin - despite my fears, the set and texture turned out perfect! Skipped the marbling, omitted  1/4 c. sugar, used 1 whole tbsp of pumpkin spice.

Everyone raved about this! Thank you for a wonderful recipe. One thing to keep in mind is that it baked up very very thin in my 9" spring form pan. Next time I make this I will be using a much smaller pan, so as to serve a more towering slice of this delectable dessert! Whatever way you slice it, thick or thin, this cheesecake definitely made me look good!!

This was such a pretty presentation and equally delicious. After reading several reviews, I made changes to the crust and the spice amounts. For the crust, I used graham cracker instead of ginger snap BUT added 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp allspice, and 1/2 tsp ground cloves. In the pumpkin batter I doubled the spice amounts. Our dinner guests were raving about the "restaurant quality" of this cheesecake!

Yes, I had to add more ginger snap cookies for the crust because by the time I got it patted out and then up around the edges there wasn't enough just going by the recipe for a 9" springform pan. But I have to say that after fixing the problem with the crust it turned out beautifully designed with marbling. I was even asked if I had bought it. And I said no ma'am I made it.

I do my cheesecakes in a water bath.  I wrap the springform  pan tightly in aluminum foil and bake the crust.  once the crust is done and cooling, I add water to a large cake pan about 1/4 to 1/2 full and put in oven so the water can heat while I am making the filling.  then I put the completed cheese cake in the water bath & cook for the allotted time.  I find that they do not crack.  this cheese cake is to die for.  when my friends find out I make this one, they all drool and I have to share.  I add heaping amts of the seasonings   YUMMY

I had no issues with the recipe as written.

I pre-baked the crust on the first batch, and it burned before the mix was done. On the second batch, didn't pre-bake the crust and also added a little pumpkin flavoring to the pumpkin mix (it needed to be a little stronger) and it turned out fine. Got a lot of compliments and requests for the recipe, so I guess they liked it, but I just don't like pumpkin, so I'll take their word for it.

Personally there was too much pumpkin and this recipe for me. I do not like a strong pumpkin Taste  in my cheesecake. This was the first time I ever attempted to make a cheesecake and it was relatively easy. However, I would read more reviews to make yours successful. I did not use a water bath and I should have because it did crack  also I would recommend that you  take your cheesecake out at least 10 minutes before they suggested cooking time.  This recipe  says you should incorporate eggs separately and stir well after each egg is added. Next time I would not stirred the eggs as much as I did. I have read other cheesecake articles that say eggs cause air which will lead to cracking. I would like to attempt this recipe again with less pumpkin until I can do it  without cracks .

Very easy to make. I made the crust with half ginger snaps and half graham crackers.  I also added mace, ginger, cloves, and a bit of nutmeg (plus cinnamon) to the filling.  I let it cool completely before transferring to thre refrigerator and it didn't crack at all.  It was best two days later when the spices released.

This is the best tasting cheesecake I have ever made.  The nuts in the crust really made it for me.

My first Cheesecake!  It was delicious.  I did double the spices because I love them. I cooked it 45 mins in a water bath then turned off the oven and let it rest for an hour before removing.  It was perfect!  My hiking group loved it

Everyone loved it...although I just used this as a basic cheesecake recipe and left out the spice and pumpkin.  I added chocolate chips (~1cup of minis) and added 1tbsp of cocoa among with 1/8 c of sugar to the cup of reserve filling and marbled with the chocolate.  It turned out marvelous.  Great basic cheesecake recipient.

I love to make cheesecakes because I think they are so very pretty with one sliced remove.  Made this for a fall fish fry and everyone loved them.

Not a big fan of ginger snap cookies so made it with graham cracker crust instead. Also baked in a water bath to keep from cracking, and allowed to cool in oven after finished baking. Easy to make and a nice pumpkin flavor to it.

Needs less sugar in each part of the  filling and I added pumpkin pie spice and some nutmeg. I'll be using the gingersnap crust for other recipes too.  Several friends have tried mine and asked for more.

we had this for our version of pumpkin pie.  It was very good, but I didn't think it had a strong pumpkin-ish taste. It was creamy and the gingersnaps added a surpriseing zing to it, but I would add more pumpkin taste to it

This was great. After reading tons of the reviews and advice I did this; Cooked in a water bath. Cooled 1 hr in over  2hrs on stove 6hrs in fridge. Mixed 1/2 gingersnaps 1/2 graham cracker for the crust. Used pumpkin pie filling. Used 2.5 8 oz cream cheese. It came out even better than I expected. I will be making this for Thanksgiving every year as my family loved it.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe for the filling because I needed to serve 9 for Thanksgiving. I should have turned the oven temp lower because it needed almost 2 hours to bake and the top got more browned than it would have in the original recipe. It did get cracks and I forgot to remove the sidewall of my spring form pan so the sides were kind of , well, not right. All of this was my fault but know what? It didn't matter the flavor and texture were awesome and it was a huge hit. If you follow the recipe and maybe make two if you need more it probably will look as good as it tastes.

I actually made this backwards.  Cake was predominately pumpkin with white on top.  It was a second dessert to our traditional sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving.  Everyone liked it.
Crust was good, but got a bit over done.  I added a little fine coconut to it, but can't say I tasted it.
Next time I would make it with butternut squash or the likes, and not cook the crust as much or use a graham cracker one. Also, for Thanksgiving I would make a fruit one, just to change up the variety.

Loved it! It wasn't quite set at the end of the baking time, so shut the oven off and just left it in the oven for about 1/2 hour longer.  It was perfect! Love the ginger snap crust!

Not the  first cheesecake, but definitely a new favorite. Had to substitute the  gingersnap cookies for Nilla wafers since gingersnap cookies are nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get in Puerto Rico. I just added ground ginger to make up for it. Also added a Sherry infused oil to the crust (1/3 TBSP). Also added 2 ounces of Brandy to the pumpkin batter for an extra kick of flavor. This ended up being the star of our Thanksgiving meal.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a huge hit! 
I followed the recipe and increase the servings size to to 16 . it was tall and wonderful. I  did as a few others did and used half Ginger Snaps and half Graham Crackers and with the Pecans  it was absolutely  heavenly. Thank you for such a wonderful and versatile recipe we will definitely be making this more often.

Great recipe. The only thing I did was add more of the same spices called for in the recipe. Will definitely make again. Thank you.

I have made cheesecakes before and they were fine. ..but I used another recipe.  The cheesecake was rubbery and the pumpkin portion just sat on the top. ..would not swirl into the rest of the batter. I will not try this again.

The cheesecake was awesome! So good that I barely had a tiny piece before it was gone! I couldn't use the pecans in the crust because of allergies. Just had one problem... There seemed to be way too much butter in the crust because I had a puddle of it in the bottom of my oven. Smokey! Thank goodness for whole house fans...

I read some reviews, and added more pumpkin..maybe 4 Oz more...and pumpkin pie spice.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese  and Stevia instead of sugar.  It was a hit!!  Didn'the say anything about the changes and no one knew the difference.   Will likely make again.

Loved the crust of this cheesecake and made as directed! I admit to making changes based on my own experiences making cheesecakes.  Used whipped cream cheese and added about 1 cup of sour cream, and about 1/2 cup more sugar.  I did double the spices and added more pumpkin.  I made 2 of these, one for home and one to give.  The first one I chilled the batter as suggested to make the marbling easier. The second one I didn't chill it. There was no difference for me. Baked on a rack in a roasting pan in a low water bath for about one hour - an hour 15 minutes.  Garnished with pecan pralines - looked beautiful (forgot to take a picture!).  I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe!  The cheese and the pumpkin strike the right balance. Also easy to make.   We served it for Thanksgiving desert and it was a success.  Recommend cooking in a water bath, wrapping the pie pan in aluminum foil to ensure water does not seep through.

I made it exactly as recommended in the recipe. The only change I would make is I wouldn't cook the crust as long. I would probably check it after 5 minutes. Otherwise I loved the cheesecake  and my Thanksgiving guests did as well!

Delicious ??. I might suggest to avoid cracks; bake in a pan of water, and avoid opening oven door while baking.

It was actually my husband who made this. He followed other bakers' advice and used half gingersnap cookies, half regular graham crackers for the crust. He made the cream cheese filling in advance and chilled it before adding it to the crust. He also used a hot water bath--just filled a roasting pan half way and put it on the rack under the cheesecake. 
We put pecans on half the cake (my son is allergic) and ate it right up--fantastic! I think next time we make it we will try using Neufchatel cheese, to try to cut down on fat and calories. We'll see if that messes it up!

This was my 1st cheesecake. The recipe was easy to follow and it turned out great! Very tasty and pretty. I am giving 4 stars because I forgot to double the pumpkin pie spices as other reviewers suggested, so the pumpkin pie flavor was mostly absent. Also, there is no topping in the recipe. I think it would be better if topped with whipped cream as the picture suggests.

Super easy and delicious.  I baked for 55 min in a water bath and then turned the oven off and let it cool as the oven cooled.  The results were great!  I will make the base batter again and add different flavorings.  Overall a very solid GO TO cheesecake recipe.  Thank you!

I think that that this recipe was good with just a hint of pumpkin taste. I used three 8 ounce packages of cream cheese. I used a graham cracker crust. I will make it again.

Excellent cheesecake!! My husband loved it and so did I. He said it was not too sweet which is what makes this delicous. Trust me, it is plenty sweet folks, don't go adding more sugar.  I don't understand why people say it tastes too much like pumpkin and not like cheesecake. It is a PUMPKIN cheesecake. I took others suggestions on adding pumpkin spice approx. 1/2 tsp in addition to other spices on recipe. Glad I did this. Started with all ingredients at room temperature. Added a pan of water in the oven. Baked 15 min on 350 and remaining time 300 degrees. Turned out perfect.,no cracks. My only thought is next time may try adding more ingredients to make this a bit thicker. It is a thin cheesecake but delicious none the less. ENJOY:)

I followed directions as per the recipe but with baking the crust before and after the filling was added the crust was pretty much burned. I couldn't take it out of the oven sooner or the filling wouldn't have been baked.

I used pumpkin pie spice instead, 1.5 tsp.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar to the pumpkin portion of the mix.  I baked mine in a water bath, no cracks.  Very, very tasty.  The best of two desserts.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It was a beautiful, delicious dessert.  I did increase the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp., nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/8 tsp. ground cloves . Note: it took  36 Nabisco gingersnaps to make the 1 1/2 cups of crushed gingersnaps for the crust.

Delicious.  I did add 1 tsp pumpkin spice but probably would have still loved it without that addition.

I cannot say enough amazing things about this cheesecake!  I make it numerous times from October to January every year.  A couple things I do differently:  first, I don't have much luck with the marbling, so I just put all the ingredients together and make simply a pumpkin cheesecake, sans marbling!  Second, I substitute brown sugar for the white.  And third, I add a top layer of 1 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla mixed week and spread evenly over the cake for the last 7-10 minutes of baking time.  I think ultimately it's the ginger snap/pecan crime story that sets this cheesecake ahead of the pack!

This was my first attempt at making a homemade cheesecake.  I took it to a friend's house for a get-together and it was a huge hit!  The recipe was very easy to follow.  I will definitely make it again!

This turned out great I did not bake the crust because I wanted it to be soft not crunchy. I baked it at 325 for an hour in a water bath and then just let it set in the oven for another 6 hours.  I  would double this recipe next time because it was a thin cheesecake for the 9" pan.

This cheesecake turned out great! I did make a couple of modifications though. I added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and used both graham cracker crumbs and ginger snap crumbs (equal parts of each).  The marbling was perfect. Since every oven is a little different, I would suggest checking the cake at 40 minutes. Mine was done in 45 minutes. Any longer and the crust would have been burned and the cake dried out. Everyone raved about it. My mother in law requested this for her birthday cake!

I will probably make this again, but with the following changes:  more spice; some salt; higher quality ginger cookies; and a shorter cooking time.  I liked the strength of the pumpkin flavor.

Loved it, followed the most helpful review and used 1/2 ginger snaps and 1/2 nilla wafers for the crust. It was a lot of flavor with only half ginger snaps, so it was a good call on that reviewers part.

Absolutely fantastic cheesecake.  Add a little more canned pumpkin  and bake a few minutes longer for an incredibly moist and delicious version.  I have made this twice in the last three weeks and am making 2 more for next week's Christmas parties.

It may have been due to baker error, but we found it to be dry overall (55 minutes may be too long for this cheesecake) and not great tasting (even though I added extra spices because of some of the other reviews).  Plus, I don't know how they got their's to be marbleized.  I tried and tried, but no luck. As I said, it may have been something I did wrong, but I'm not willing to try it again to find out!

Excellent recipe! Everyone who tried it loved it! I did use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and an extra pinch of nutmeg. I also refrigerated the pumpkin batter for 5 minutes to let it harden a little, but not get too cold. Use a pan of water in the oven under the cheesecake while cooking to help it stay moist. Also, let it cool gradually by opening the oven door for a little, then after about an hour take it out of the oven for a few hours before putting it in the fridge so that it doesn't get condensation on it overnight.

I followed the recommendations of many reviewers to make the crust with 1/2 gingersnap and 1/2 cinnamon graham crackers, and this turned out perfectly! It was delicious and a huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner (though I can see myself making this again as just a seasonal dessert). I'm not a big pumpkin pie fan, but this had just the right amount of spice and I am hooked!

Amazing!!!! This was my first time making cheesecake and it tastes soooo good! I could not find a pan that would hold all of the cheesecake mix and crust evenly so I made them into marbled cheesecake cupcakes instead. I scooped 1Tbsp of crust mix (gingerbread cookie &butter) into each cupcake mold. Then I took 3 Tbsp of the pumpkin mix in each and 1 Tbsp of the regular cheesecake mix and swirled with a tooth pick. I baked them at 325 degrees and left those bad boys in there for 20-25 minutes. Some of them came out cracked but that's okay because they are still delicious!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE RECIPE!

I made this for my church's harvest party and it was literally gone within 5 minutes of me cutting it. (And I cut it into 16ths.) I made a few changes to the recipe, all of which were listed in the other comments. For example: My crust was half gingersnap half graham cracker. I refridgerated the non-pumpkin portion of the batter for 20 minutes before swirling the two together. I added 1/4 teaspoon of allspice and cloves,  1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin spice and ginger to the pumpkin portion of the batter. When baking, I filled a large crock with water and put it on the bottom rack of the oven to keep my cake from cracking.

Yummy! I would make it again and again. Next time I'll just use half a cup of the mixture to use for the marble effect instead of an entire cup. The taste was great! My crust came out a little overdone so next time I will only cook it about 4 minutes instead of 8.  I did put a pan of water under my cheesecake on the bottom rack. Usually when I make cheesecake I put it inside of a water bath and I didn't do that this time. Not sure if that's why the crust was tough. The guests loved it. :) I will be making this again for Thanksgiving!

Delicious! Made this yesterday and tastes even better today. Used a coffee grinder to get the pecans as fine as the gingersnap crumbs - the crust was so much nicer than your typical graham cracker type.  Next time, I'll increase the spices in the pumpkin batter slightly  and only reserve 3/4 cup of the plain batter for the swirl effect.

This IS the recipe you are looking for!! Take a look a look at my pic. The perfect swirl look means not overdoing the swirl. I recommend checking on cheesecake at the 40 min mark and go from there.

This cheesecake is super yummy:). I made it for a party at school and everyone loved it. I might add just a little bit more vanilla next time, but its still pretty great as is.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone complimented me and gobbled it all up! Huge step up from the pumpkin cheesecake I made last year by far! I followed what a few of the comments suggested and made the filling first and stuck in the fridge, then made the crust. I also mixed in some graham cracker crumbs with the gingersnap crumbs to avoid the "overwhelming ginger taste" some people mentioned. The crust was the best part, it melted in your mouth! I also added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg than suggested, but that's just a personal preference.

This was great! I used others suggestion and used the pumpkin pie filling, flavor was perfect. Also used whipped cream cheese,  it's easier to work with and makes the cheesecake really creamy. Will definitely make again.

All cracked up!
 
Don't bake your cheesecake at too high a temperature. The egg proteins will over-coagulate from too much heat which eventually shrink when cooled, causing cracking usually in its center or tiny cracks all over its top. If you heat it up to fast or cool it down too fast you're also going to get cracks.  
Also, as I put it in the oven I recalled cheesecake recipes that needed a water bath, but disregarded my instinct- usually a mistake. Next time maybe I'll be wiser.

I felt like there was nothing too special about this cheesecake. Perhaps I did something wrong with the pumpkin portion of the batter, but it kind of tasted like sweet potato pie and not much like pumpkin, even though I used pumpkin. Still good as a Thanksgiving dessert, just not what I expected.

This was great! I added a little more of the spices and used about 3/4 can of the pumpkin (I like pumpkin!) and it turned out perfect! Shared it at work and several people asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

I baked the cheesecake as written, but left out the pecans in the crust, adding about 1/2 c more crushed gingersnaps. It came out perfectly marbled and beautiful. I did put a pan of water in the oven with it and made sure to run a knife around the edges when it was done. I baked at 350 for 50 min, checking at 40 min. Turned the oven off and cracked the door and left it for an hour. Beautiful.

I didn't love it and judging by the fact that leftovers weren't finished over the next couple days, neither did others in the household.  I've had better pumpkin cheesecakes (made by someone else). I think i like the non marbled versions better because they seem creamier.  Will keep searching for that ultimate recipe I tried at a long ago party...

This recipe was so simple and I loved it. I did the way recipe was written on my first one and then I switched it up a bit on my second one. The second one I used pumpkin spice cream cheese for one of the packages. It didn't marble but it tasted fantastic.

I made this because I was tired of pumpkin pie and it was delicious. Very easy to make, and it didn't take too long either. We had our first piece while it was still warm from the oven and everyone loved it. I was generous with the spices and added a bit of ginger to the filling. Will probably add more next time. Also, be sure to buy good quality ginger snaps; the cheap ones I used lacked the desired intensity.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! It was my very first cheesecake ever and everyone was very impressed! I did add 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and mixed in graham crackers with the ginger snaps for the crust, I was afraid of it being too ginger snappy :). But it was FANTASTIC!

Since I made this in a regular pie pan (don't have a springform), there was enough filling to almost fill up two, definitely too much for one. It ended up baking just fine without cracks. I put the prepared filling in the fridge while making the crust which allowed for distinct, separate marbling. I was hoping you could discern the "plain" cheesecake flavor from the pumpkin, but the pumpkin overwhelmed everything. Still, very good, and very easy.

This was my first made from scratch cheesecake.  I planned to bake this for Thanksgiving dinner--but made a "practice" cake the week before.  I was disappointed -- the crust stuck to the pan and the cheesecake was less than an inch tall and a little dry.  Any suggestions-- beat the eggs longer or less -- bake less???  Luckily my co-workers are my taste testers (they'll try anything) --they loved the flavor.

This recipe is just AWESOME!!!  I make this regularly now for Thanksgiving and everyone raves about it.  It's a great alternative to the plain old pumpkin pie.  Many thanks for the recipe!!

I made this cheesecake last year and the ginger falvor was a little overwhelming, the graham crackers are a good idea.  Extra spices would also enhance the pumkin flarvoring.  Great suggestions to a very good cheesecake.  Happy Thanksgiving!!

It was pretty good but turned out a little dry.  I think I overcooked it but it didn't set by the time listed in the recipe.  It's a good seasonal recipe.

I also enlarged this recipe to an 18 serving size. Used hazelnuts and pecans and graham crackers and gingersnaps for the base. The base had a nice taste and added to the uniqueness of the recipe. I was disappointed in the cheese cake even though I added extra spices. I froze my cake for a week and found that it tasted better the second day.

Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner couldn't get over how amazing this cheesecake was. The ginger snap crust was what topped this flavorful dish to the top of our list.

Absolutely delicious - I thought it was wonderful!  I didn't have gingersnaps, so I used graham cracker crumbs and added some powdered ginger and cinnamon to the crust.  We are a dairy-free house due to allergies, and I just wanted to say that Tofutti's "cream cheese" made a delicious cheesecake that went completely unnoticed by all that ate it - I was nervous, serving it to a whole bunch of men who were here as guests, but they all asked for seconds and thirds, and ate it in record time...  So I guess it was good!

I love anything pumpkin and cheesecake, so I made this last Thanksgiving. It was good, but I don't think I would make it again. It didn't seem to have enough flavor. I followed the recipe and it turned out just the way it was supposed to...I was just a little disappointed.

Loved it!  So good!  I didn't do the full gingersnap crust, I did a partial with mostly graham cracker because the gingersnaps I bought were so potent.  The pecans were a must thought!

This was geat- will be using this for a long time to come.  I didn't have pecans for the crust, so just used an equal amount of gingersnap crumbs.  I also doubled the spice amount, and only used pumpkin pie spice.  Great recipe- I have had many compliments.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic. The gingersnap crust is to die for. I did not change a thing except for the water bath. I will be  making this for Christmas and will take Kathryn's advice and bake at 325 for 70 min. in the water bath. I just wrap foil under my springform pan so water will not get in. I may also add one more 8 oz cream cheese. GREAT CHEESECAKE!!

I've made this cheesecake twice now.  Once with the pecans in the crust and once without. I really liked it with no pecans.  When that are added to the crust they overpower the taster of the gingersnaps.  Love the cheesecake but better without the pecans.

Nice mix between cheesecake and pumpkin pie. I did make some changes: I used vanilla wafers instead of gingersnap cookies. I also added 2 tbsp of brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla butter nut extract, added a 1/2 cup of heavy cream, 1/2 cup of flour, and omitted the pecans.

This cheesecake was such a hit that I made it twice back to back for Thanksgiving dinner at church and at friends this year. My friend who claimed the pumpkin pie as one of the "must-have" items of thanksgiving declared that she would take this cheesecake over Pumpkin pie anytime!!

This was very good -- as adjusted according to suggestions by Trish (nov 18th 08 review).  Added dash of ground gloves, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp or so of fresh nutmeg.  

Baked at 325 for 55 mins over a pan of water.  Cracked oven and let cool in oven about an hour.  Didn't have time to put in fridge for several hours, as she suggested. (No cracks)

I also held back around a 1/4 c of the pumpkin batter and drizzled 1/2 c of the plain batter on the top, then the 1/4 c of pumpkin batter, then the rest of the plain batter and swirled from there.  Looked great. 

I used vanilla wafers and almonds in the crust, as that was what I had on hand.  I would prefer the pecans - but the almonds were okay too. 

All in all this was a very good cheesecake, with the changes!

This is the FIRST cheesecake I have ever made, I've now made it twice! Both times I used McCormick Pumpkin-Pie Spice instead of the spices called for in the recipe only because I love the flavor of pumpkin pie. I also added about a pinch of ground cloves. I read the reviews before making this and tried the water bath in the oven and my cheesecake didn't crack. One cup of the white marbling seemed too much at first- but the second time I made this cheesecake I decided to give it a try and I am very glad I did-it looks and tastes even better!

Reserving 1 cup of batter seemed to be too much. Also, does the crust always get dark brown to almost burnt looking?

Made this for a fall-themed dinner the other night. It was okay. My husband really liked it and my guests professed to as well, but I think it needed more seasonings than I put in. I doubled the amounts and even threw in some pumpkin pie spice and yet, it still tasted bland to me. I used cinnamon graham crackers and pecans for the crust because I couldn't find any pre-made gingersnaps at my local grocery (which is tiny). I think I'll keep looking for my pumpkin cheesecake keeper.

Good - I added an additional 1 t of pumpkin spice to the mix and followed the others advise for the swapping of step 1 and 2.  Overall I would say it tasted more like pumpkin pie than pumpkin cheesecake however, that didn't stop everyone from eating it all up.

I normally do not like cheesecake but this is the one exception. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the first dessert to disappear.

This recipe is pretty good but I expected the cheesecake to have a bit more of a pumpkin flavor to it. But it was very good. And the crust is a great addition to the flavor - the gingersnaps are tasty!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Even those that don’t like pumpkin pie liked this cheesecake. One of my co-workers took half a piece just to be polite and after eating it quickly returned for the other half! I forgot to add the last 1/4 cup sugar and it was still great. Everyone wanted the recipe!

This was so fabolous this Thanksgiving! I used all-spice instead of nutmeg and it works great. Also I just did a graham cracker crust b/c of time and we all loved it. A little extra batter left over so I filled four muffin cups for little individual cheesecakes to keep for myself. :o)

This was only my second cheesecake, so I am no expert.  However, this came out wonderfully.  I made my own crust from gingersnap dough, prebaked it, and let it cool while I prepared the filling.  For the filling, I made 1.5 times the amount as I have a 10" pan and other reviews said it was a bit skimpy.  I also added more spices, including 1t ginger and 1/2t cloves.  For marbling, I poured in half of the plain, then the pumpkin, then the plain again and have a beautiful pattern on top.  I did not do a waterbath, but put a pan of water on the lower rack.  The cake did not crack until after I ran a knife along the edge, but it is very minor.  I gave it 4 stars only because of the adjustments I have made.

the flavor was what i expected, although maybe a little to much pumpkin and not enough cheesecake.  it was also a little too flat.  i might try it again and add more cheesecake batter and overall double the recipe.

This was a great recipe!  I have been looking for a marble pumpkin cheesecake recipe and this definitely hit the spot. I only had hazelnuts for the crust, but the flavor actually came out very good.  I think next time, instead of putting the white cheesecake mixture on top, I will layer pumpkin - white - pumpkin.  I didn't get a lot of swirling action when I followed the directions.  I think by layering it the swirls may come through better.

I thought this was really good.  My only complaint was that my crust turned out too thick in some places but that's more my fault.  I definitely prefer the gingersnap crust to a pastry crust.  However, no one else was very impressed, so I knocked off a star in my rating.  Oh well...

Great recipe - easy to make.  I wanted to use up all the pumkin in the can, so I mixed that in with the swirl mixture with a little sour cream. Will definitely make this for family.

I was a little disappointed in the marbling. I guess I should have layered the two and then pulled a knife through, also the pumpkin part was not sweet enough.  I added pumpkin pie spice instead of the ones listed and the flavor was great, but I will change it a little next time.

This cheesecake got rave Thanksgiving reviews, though mine did not marble in the least. Next time I'll either do it as layers or mix the pumpkin right into the cream cheese mixture, as that was very runny, even though I refrigerated it. Still delicious!

Definately a keeper in my book!  Was a hit at Thanksgiving for something different than just "pumpkin pie".  Had to bake about 10 minutes longer in my oven though until set through.

This recipe was just o.k. for us.  Not really a stand out recipe.  It just tasted like something was missing, but I am not sure what.  The crust however was delicious.  I will most likely try this again but with some changes.

I made this one for Thanksgiving dinner desert- I thought it tasted more like a "cakey" pumpkin pie than a cheesecake, but my family liked it... I probably won't try this cheesecake again- beautiful presentation with the marbled top though :)

This was not as good as I had hoped for, even though I followed the directions exactly. Nobody complained about it, but nobody raved about it, either. The crust was great, though -- much better than a regular graham cracker crust!

Got a huge, deep crack in this cake, even though I baked it in a water bath!  Tasted great, though. . . .I doubled the spices called for in the recipe, and also added 1/2 tsp of ground cloves and allspice.  I wish it was taller, though. . . . anyone try doubling the filing?  I wasn't brave enough to alter the baking time on my own.

I never heard of the water on the lower rack thing to prevent cracking but I tried it as recommended by other reviews and it works great! This is a fantastic dessert!~everyone loved it.  i used light cream cheese and 1/2 the sugar. gingersnap crust is a good idea~something different. I've tried other pumpkin dessert recipes but keep coming back to this one. its a keeper!

This was good but not great. Mine was beautifully marbled, however,even with adding more pumpkin and more spices it wasn't "pumpkiny" enough for our tastes.  Our guests liked it a lot, however, and,  oh, the gingersnap crust was really good!

So good! I used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it turned out great! I also used a homemade gingersnap cookie for the base. However, next time I won't add the extra 1/3 cup of butter to the crust...it turned out really greasy because of the homemade crust.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The gingersnap crust was a perfect combination with the pumpkin.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I'm not an expert on cheesecakes, but this one turned out really well!  I did have a problem with the swiriling effect, though, and mine cracked.  So next time I will definitely chill the filling, and use a water bath.  Otherwise, really yummy!  Thanks!

A delicious and easy cheesecake - no cracks, and the texture was perfect!  The pumpkin part of the cake tastes a lot like a Pumpkin Chiffon pie, so to mix it with the traditional cheesecake taste is wonderful - next time I may even divide the batter in half to have a more equal blend of both.

Yummy Yummy Yummy.  The gingersnaps are an absolute must. They had such a POW that compliments the pumpkin beautifully. I used pumkin pie spice because I had it on hand, worked out just fine instead of using the different spices. This is a gread addition to any Thanksgiving table. If fall could have a taste, it would be this. Excellent!

Loved it!  I didn't have gingersnaps so I used cinnimon grahm crackers instead, worked great!  Had over some friends to help eat, everyone thought it was wonderful.  Not to heavy and a great easy recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

It tasted good but the darkening of the outside crust was very bitter tasting. I cut off about 1 inch of the outside of the cake and pressed chopped pecans into the sides to enhance the presentation.

I'm not a pumpkin pie fan so this is a fantastic alternative. The gingersnap crust makes all the difference and I really like that it doesn't have a strong pumpkin flavor. It's a BIG hit the several times I've made it!!!

To die for! My family couldn't get enough so I was making pumpkin cheesecakes the entire holiday season. Just wish I knew how to keep it from splitting down the middle after I finish baking it. Not sure what I'm doing wrong there.

Yummy but not the best I've had.  Added 1/2 cup butter for the crust if not it was too dry.
Baked it for only 40 minutes it was starting to crack.
Easy to make as my first baked cheesecake.  Thanks for sharing!

I was very disappointed in this cheesecake.  I thought the gingersnap crust would be good but it had a slightly burnt taste and got soggy.  I also thought the cheesecake part needed something...was not punpkiny or spicy enough.  I'll try another recipe next time.

My first cheesecake I every made.  I didn't have canned pumpkin so I used the canned pumpkin pie mix.  Brought it into work - everyone LOVED it.  One person doesn't like cheesecake - he is now converted, he had 2 slices.  One person didn't like pumpkin - she is now converted, had a full slice.  Two made the comment it was orgasmic - what more can I say.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I would have given this 4 stars, only because i am not a huge fan of pumpkin. My family on the other hand raved about it.  It was a rich dessert and looked nice with the marble effect.

This recipe was OK.  I didn't much care for it, but I took it to work and it disappeared in minutes, so it must be all right.  It doesn't raise high enough for me.  Not as much cream cheese used in this recipe like other cheesecakes.

I would have given this only three stars, but my family said they enjoyed it, so I rated it a little higher.  I was disappointed with this cheesecake.  It just tasted very bland (with the exception of the crust, which was very good).  I'm not sure what it needed more of -- sugar, spices, pumpkin, or the addition of sour cream, but I just found it rather tasteless.

Pretty tasty.  I wish it would've been a taller cheesecake, but overall the flavor was really good.

I made this recipe as is.....except I put 1tsp cinnamon and about 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  It was FANTASTIC!  I will definitely make this again.  Loved the pecans in the ginger crust.

This was delish!  Made it for Thanksgiving today and it was gone in about 10 minutes flat.  Everyone raved about it.  I love trying new recipes and seeing all of the great reviews on this page enticed me to give this one a try and I'm glad I did.  This one's a keeper!  I did reduce the temperature a little because I use a dark coated pan and when I baked the crust, it seemed to come close to burning so I added a few minutes to the baking time and it was great.  Give this one a try!

EXCELLENT!! My 2 and 6 year olds loved it, as so did my husband and I.  Next time I will try whipped topping and drizzle carmel - I read from another review.  Will be a dessert for the holidays.  THANKS!!!!!

This turned out very mushy, and didn't have a lot of flavor.  It tasted more like pumpkin pudding than cheesecake.
