This is a very good marinade.  I wound up marinating for more than 30 minutes. I did use  fresh Rosemary. I prefer to use fresh herbs because it elevates the dish to a whole new level.  I would use this marinade on other fish.  I would even suggest using this for a pork loin or pork chops.  I think the flavors would go really well with that type of protein.  I served this on a bed of parmesan polenta and topped it with a polenta cake.  I reserved some of the marinade to drizzle over the fish.  The marinade I reserved was put aside before I added the fish.  As to not contaminate it.  I highly recommend reserving some on the side.  It's really delicious.  I did DOUBLE the recipe knowing I was going to reserve some to drizzle.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for dinner and loved it. I didn't have any rosemary but it was great without.

Wonderful and flavorful. It's the dead of winter and instead of the grill, I used my oven. Turned out perfect. Like a few others, I reserved some of the marinade and topped it with it at serving time. Very, very good and most definitely will make this again.

this was just as described - simple and elegant; really delicious too! I used 6oz center cut salmon portions for each person; served with brown rice and slivered almonds; asparagus tips drizzed w/ sesame oil - baked in foil, and steamed baby spinach. Very healthy, but the compliments focused on the fantastic flavors. Thank you so much cdagirl!

This recipe is awesome! I love salmon, my husband, not so much but when I made this dish he commented it was the best salmon he ever ate. Would be great served over spring mix with a light dressing. Certainly suitable for company. Allrecipes is the best. I find such great recipes right at my fingertips. Thanks

I do not like rosemary at all and whenever I make recipes that call for it, I substitute with something else.  For this dish, I substituted with oregano and we loved it.

This is such a flexible and FAST recipe. I like to substitute Arctic Chard. Sometimes it's cheaper than salmon, and it's rated very high on the sustainability scale!

This was really good. Salmon is probably my least favorite fish but I've been trying new ways of incorporating it more into my diet. This was probably the best way I've made it so far. I actually marinated all night and it had such good flavor. I would definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe to the letter except I cut it in half.  I always said you can't mess up salmon.  I was wrong. There are so many better recipes for salmon, there is no reason to let your salmon die in vain. Look for another recipe.

I made salmon with this recipe once before, and it was delicious! Being on a budget, I bought frozen salmon, but you'd never know it with this recipe. I'm marinating my salmon right now, and will serve with couscous and brussels sprouts. The whole meal, for two, cost about $6.

I accidentally added more rosemary than called for, but we like rosemary, so it was fine. This fish tasted fantastic, and looked like something I'd order in a restaurant. So easy to prepare, too!

Needed a quick recipe so I didn't marinate at all.  Used fresh rosemary and extra garlic.  Delicious--all three kids and husband cleaned their plates and all but one went back for seconds.  Thank you!

I used half of a whole salmon as that was all I had. I knew the marinade wasn't going to penetrate the fish very well, so I  diced up some Roma tomatoes  and roasted them with the salmon. The tomatoes took in the marinade nicely, creating a balsalmic/tomato salsa. Yum!

Easy to make with a nice flavor. I made it with herb baked baby red skin potatoes and a salad that I had already planned on making with a balsamic vinegarette which is what I used for the salmon because I didn't have regular balsamic vinegar. While family loved it. I baked it on a bed of red onions and I put it under the broiler for one additional minute. Well done.

Great simple recipe. I love the salmon a little blackened- it adds an extra dimension of flavour. This is the first recipe I rated. But it was so simple and good. My kids loved it. This one is a keeper.

Loved this....I often don't particularly enjoy salmon dishes (it very much depends on how it is prepared) but this marinade is delicious and really well suited for salmon.

Loved it!  I probably didn't marinate it for 30 minutes but it was still so flavorful, and I didn't put any extra marinade on it after it had cooked either!  It was easy and delicious, paired with roasted red potatoes, carrots and onions. HMmmmmm :)

Very easy, very good.  I didn't actually marinade it, I just covered it and cooked.  The whole family enjoyed it.

Salmon is not my hubby's favorite fish, but he really liked it prepared this way.  Simple, tasty recipe.  Fresh garlic tastes better than the powder. Definitely use foil lined baking sheet or else you'll have a baked on mess!

The best recipe I've ever gotten from this website.  The only thing I did different is take out the rosemarybecause I don't care for it.

This was absolutely amazing!  Will make again and again.  I would even add a touch more rosemary.

This was ok, I had a lot of salmon so I made it this way and "baked salmon II" and I think the baked salmon II was better, my husband liked them both equally.
