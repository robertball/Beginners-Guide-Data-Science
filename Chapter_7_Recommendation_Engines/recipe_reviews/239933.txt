Made this last night. Made a few small changes based on what I had. Used panko breadcrumbs on chicken, since I didn't have any saltines. They worked out great, and I don't think it changed the texture or taste too much. Also used olive oil to saut√© chicken and veggies since we have  lactose  issues. Butter would have added more flavor, but it was still really good. It was a little bland, but that might have been because of the changes. I will make this again, since my husband and I both enjoyed it. Maybe add  more salt and more spices. Thanks for the recipe. We really enjoyed it!

I have never rated a recipe before but I HAD to rate this one! This is one of the very best recipes I have ever made!!!!! I made it exactly as it is and I was a bit leary when I realized it only had two reviews.  The finished product comes together so wonderfully and is full of flavor!  I just have to say I ate every bite of this, reheating leftovers twice after the original cooking date and it was even fabulous reheated!!! This will definitely be a regular "go-to" in my house! My husband loved it too and he is not the easiest to please. I highly recommend it!!!!

I am tickled pink to be the first review of this recipe. My package of chicken breasts was only 3 pounds but other than that I made as written. This was so simple but the end result was bursting with flavor and tasted as if I had fussed over it for hours. There is only two of us and I was worried that the leftovers would be soggy but I was worried for nothing. The chicken held its crispness and lunch the next day was just as good. I plan on making this often. We enjoyed this very much Howard. Thanks for sharing!

This was a decent recipe. I think it was fine with the onions and mushrooms, but next time I will add in additional vegetables, like zucchini and maybe spinach.  I may use less wine next time. Pretty good- thanks for sharing.
