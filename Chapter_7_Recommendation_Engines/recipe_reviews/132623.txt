Custard was great, but only after doubling the sweetening. Perhaps some people like a barely sweet dessert, but I was skeptical about 1/3 cup of brown sugar when I read the recipe, knowing that a pumpkin pie filling that uses the same amounts of pumpkin and evaporated milk requires about 3/4 cup of sugar for proper sweetening. The orange juice will add some sweetness, but not enough.  After tasting the mixture before baking, I doubled the sugar, and it then tasted just right. Be sure to taste for it yourself before you bake it so that you can adjust the sweetness accordingly. Easiest prep is put everything in the blender, then pour to fill the custard cups. No drips, no mess, one thing to wash. I cut the cayenne in half because 1) the bottle was new and potent and 2) I'm a wuss. 1/8 tsp cayenne added plenty of "kick" for me, with a nice, subtle warmth, but no bite. Absolute perfection! This recipe works equally well with mashed cooked, peeled sweet potato or squash (you need 2 cups.) Added a little orange peel, which contributed an additional fresh, clean flavor. Have also added 1 Tb dark rum, which gives a lot of depth. I've also made it with Splenda (be sure to refrigerate well, as Splenda can have a funky taste when warm.) All in all, this is a wonderful concept, a keeper recipe. Can be baked in a pie shell, as well. 15 minutes at 425, then turn down to 350 for 45 minutes.

Good, but needs spices. I use 1 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves and a dash of allspice and nutmeg. Not necessary to used skimmed evaporated milk - the regular works, too. Also I substitute 2 whole eggs for the 4 egg whites. As written, it's a fat free recipe which is nice for dieters, but for those not worried about a few calories, using regular evaporated milk and whole eggs gives a nicer texture and doesn't add all that much in the way of fat or calories. I followed Baricat's advice and used only half the cayenne, and we thought it was just right that way. It was warm, but not burning hot. Also agree with her advice about the sweetening. It needs to be doubled, or maybe even a tad more. We use Splenda here because of diabetes, and 1 cup of Splenda is just about right.

Great, I added homemade applesauce instead of o.j. as I didn't have any and just used whole eggs. It came out a little denser. Also if you live in a cold climate like me I just turn my oven off and open the door somewhat to release the heat into the air and leave the custard in the oven to cool, Then you dont scald yourself with the hot water of pan. Never waste that precious heat from your oven by closing the door in the winter time. YOu would be surprised if you use your oven like me alot just how much energy you can save.

Too much of a kick. Unfornately, the cayenne did not taste good, maybe it was too much. I would love to make this again as a great lowfat custard but without the cayenne.

I made it per the recipe and loved the "kick".  Great alternative to pumpkin pie or just if you want something different.  I agree that different combinations of spices could be used to suit your taste.  But try it once with the cayenne..to taste.

Excellent! Quite spicy for a dessert, but really in my style. I used other people's suggestions: I mixed it all in a blender, making it easy to pour; and, I used unsweetened applesauce for lack of OJ. I added only one thing, about 1/8 t of salt, so that the custard would not taste flat. Perfect!

I used 2% evaporated milk and omitted the cayenne pepper.  It was a hit with everyone!  This is a heart-healthy, flavorful, creamy dessert with the perfect amount of sweetness using only the 1/3 cup of packed brown sugar.   I added half a cinnamon stick to the top of each cooked custard for decoration.  For those who chose to have a dollop of freshly-made whipped cream on their custard, I added a half a cinnamon stick to the top of the whipped cream.

I just now made this recipe here are just a few modifications: I used 1/4 C maple syrup, 1/2 C brown sugar and increased the spices & added 1/2tsp cloves, nutmeg,cinnamon & 2 tsp ginger. I have to admit I left the cayenne pepper out
