I've been making this recipe for quite a while and always gets good reviews by guests.  I omit the roe (I don't think it needs it.)  

Serving tip to really impress your guests:  get the phillo cups in the frozen section and bake as directed on the package.  After they have cooled, pipe in the salmon mousse into the phillo cups.  Top with a little fresh dill.  This is a very easy, impressive dish for a cocktail party!

Be improve the look of this dish, I lined a small bowl (a large teacup would do) with clingfilm, then with cold smoked salmon, then filled it with the mousse. Then I folded the edges of the smoked salmon over the top, followed by the clingfilm.  I chilled the mousse like this, then inverted onto a platter and removed the clingfilm.  The result was a beautiful mound of smoked salmon with the delicious mousse inside.  Fantastic.

It was the hit of my Christmas party - not one lick left in the dish! Added horseradish as suggested, plus a couple of drops of Tabasco and it was irresistible. Thank you.

This was a huge hit! I made this for a huge party I was hosting. I piped the mousse with a pastry bag in slightly cooked phyllo cups and topped with a chive.  The guests gobbled these up by the dozen.  It does help to have the large cuisinart, as I burned out my engine on the mini-prep because I made four batches.

Made this and incorporated some suggestions below.  Used 2/3rds the cream cheese amount so that the smoked salmon flavor would come through.  Used probably about two tablespoons of fresh dill, and added a teaspoon of horseradish.  Piped into some premade phyllo cups and garnished with another sprig of dill.  Very tasty, creamy salmon dish.  Received several complements and I would definitely make this again.  It did honestly only take about 15 minutes to make, and I made the mousse the day before, refrigerated, and then piped into phyllo just before leaving the house just to ensure they kept from getting soggy.  I didn't notice that the flavor changed too much overnight one way or the other by the way.

Easy, simple and good..
if garnishing with caviar the black ink seems to bleed in, 
Bring out of fridge about 30 mins or so before, so it can soften up a tad.

My husband whipped this up to take to a Super Bowl Party and he said it got rave reviews and none of the "guys" believed he made it.  I didn't get to taste it, but it certainly got a high approval rating from the "guys" as there were no leftovers for my hubby to bring home.  He said to thank you for making him such a star!

Made this the other night, but quantities of the smoked salmon came in 3oz packages, so I bought two of them to make this.  The only other thing I did was used the reduced fat cream cheese.  Wife loved it (too fancy for the kids), and since it made a lot, I brought some for work -- people gobbled it up and wanted the recipe!

I will definitely make this again!

5 stars as written but I added 1 clove minced garlic, 1/2 tsp horseradish, added lemon zest,  4 drops liquid smoke, couple shots of Worchester (sp?) sauce, topped with fresh dill and used no roe. Put mousse in Ziploc bag, cut bottom corner off to pipe into phyllo cups.  Big hit at the party and easy to do!

This is pretty good, but I think it tasted a little too cream cheesy.  I want the predominant flavor to be the salmon so next time I'll use 1/2 the cream cheese.

Oh my gosh, this stuff is delicious! I've made it several times, but this last time we made it with some salmon that my boyfriend made and it was pure heaven. He brined it for 12 hours, dried it for 5 and then smoked it for 8... the quality of salmon used is super important. Oh, do use FRESH dill (and plenty of it)-it makes a huge difference! I like a bit more lemon juice in mine too. I could eat it every day. It is so impressive and incredibly simple.

My first attempt came out very bland. If I try again then I'll add more and better quality smoked salmon.

This was one of several Easter appetizers this year.  I served it on Asian sesame crackers with a thinly sliced piece of cucumber, topped with the smoked salmon mousse, finely chopped red onion, a caper, and fresh dill.  (I doubled the recipe but that made too much for 12 people...next time I'll just use the amounts listed).  Can be made a day ahead.

Very good.  I prepared the mousse as directed and piped in to phyllo cups as other reviewers suggested.  I topped 1/2 with a few capers and the other half with fresh chopped dill.  Very elegant presentation and so eary and quick to prepare.

I made this for a houseparty last night, and people loved it.  Instead of dried dill, I used a tablespoon of chopped fresh dill.  I didn't have heavy cream on hand, so I used mayo.  I served it with rice crackers...yum.  Oh, be sure to soften up the cream cheese first.  The blender had a really hard time blending the cream cheese, so I had to transfer everything to my kitchen aid mixer.  The mixer did a good job whipping everything up, but I think the blender was still necessary for pureeing the salmon.

I HATE salmon. Hate it. But I was licking the spoon after mixing this! My blender had a tough time with the salmon and also the cream cheese, but I got it done. Doubled the recipe but cut back the cream cheese a little, added a touch more cream. It was glossy and beautiful! Added 2 tsp chopped garlic (from a jar, with juice), put a little tarragon on top for garnish as I had no dill. Left out the roe. I liked it when first made, but refrigerated it for a few hours before a party and it got stronger tasting -- I thought it was too strong, wouldn't do that again.

Oh my, this is such a pretty dish, and yummy as well.  Your guests will think you are a rock star.  Absolutely a great recommendation comes from reviewer "a cook in tampa."  Get the phillo cups from the freezer section of your grocery store. Mine didn't even require cooking.  Use a disposable pastry bag and squirt into the phillo cup. Makes a beautiful swirl.  Tres elegante. Top with some dried dill.  I don't have a food processor, and it didn't work in my 25 year old blender, so just used a hand mixer.  Also skipped the roe, actually don't even know what it is:>. Very light and good appetizer.

Great recipe...used red salmon I caught and smoked myself.  Put some chopped fresh dill on top for looks.  Everyone loved it.  Caught one friend licking the bowl out when empty.

I left out the salmon roe which made for a moree subtle taste. I made it for a pink party; I toasted white toast bread, cut out hearts with a cookie cutter and used an icing bag to put rosettes of the mousse on the hearts, it looked fantastic.

Very good! Based on other reviews, I reduced the cream cheese a bit for more smoked salmon flavor, added a bit of horseradish, left out the roe and instead of going out to buy heavy cream, used a splash of whole milk. Just small tweaks on a great recipe. I will definitely make this again!

I'm 8 months pregnant & I've been craving salmon mousse from a local restaurant that folded. This is not the same recipe... it's better! I used fresh dill from my herb garden and packaged lemon juice because it's what I had on hand. I will defiantly be making this again.

Killer.  Added two garlic cloves crushed into the food processor.  Got all uppity and piped it into the filo cups as per other suggestions and made red flowers out of red onion with caper center and fresh dill for the foliage.  Made a double batch and it goes a long way on account of it being rich.  Could have easily done four pkgs of cups.  Will do this until people tell me to stop, and they won't

Yummy! Had to add a bit more liquid for it to pipe properly, and it took the blender a while to mix it all. Big hit at party I attended. Omitted the roe and the added salt since plenty salt was in the smoked salmon. I stuffed scooped-out cherry tomatoes & while good, it was time consuming- next time will just pipe it onto cucumber slices.

This is the recipe I've been looking for!  It's fantastic just how it is.  I would like to try adding a touch of worcestershire.  I think the cream really helped make it more "spreadable" then other versions I've tried.

We have a Kentucky Derby party each year and are always looking for new recipes.  We have a caterer, but still do about 2/3 of the food.  I used the salmon mousse in the filo shells.  It was a big hit.  Even the caterer asked for hte recipe.

Very tasty, though I swapped the cream for natural yoghurt, less fat, and it was perfect. I am repeatedly asked for this recipe at parties and B.B.Q's.

It was pretty good, but I think I have made better salmon mousse.  Sort of blah.  Don't add salt, I only added a little and it was too salty.  Maybe it was the smoked salmon I bought?  I bought Scottish smoked salmon.

Delicious! I didn't have heavy cream, used 1/2 n 1/2, but turned out wonderfully. I used phyllo tartlets to pipe the mousse into.

This really is delicious but for me the salmon flavor was kind of overpowered by the cream cheese.  I used sockeye so maybe I need to try and different variety of salmon.  But all in all it was delicious.

I have used a very similar recipe for some time.  I do not use liquid at all (or any roe), but do mix in some sour cream to loosen it up and add tabasco and very finely chopped onion.  Always a big hit!

Simply wonderful!  Creamy, slightly sweet, with hints of brightness from the lemon and dill surround the smoked salmon flavor.  I also tried it with  about 20 capers added to the mousse to make the brightness a little more complex.  I may try it next time with a few sprigs of fresh celantro.  Thanks!

This was great, my first try at salmon mousse. I skipped the roe and used fresh dill, otherwise I made it exactly as directed. I followed another reviewer's advice and made it in a mold, covered by smoked salmon slices (lox). It was beautiful,  and a hit at the party!

I made this for New Years Eve. Everyone LOVED it! It was the first thing gone!  I left out the dill and roe (because I didn't have any) and added a dash of Old Bay and a dash of onion powder and a little extra cream.  I didn't put any salt or pepper either. I served it with several types of crackers and toast, cucumber slices, and capers on the side. It was great! I will make again soon!

I just made this for a New Years Eve party. It is important to note that you really need to use GOOD smoked salmon for this dish. I used some from the supermarket (pre-wrapped) and it is SO salty and incredibly oaky (bc it was smoked on a wooden plank of some sort). I used every tip from these reviews that I could find and threw in an extra 4 oz of cream cheese, 1 clove of garlic, some worcestershire, and tons of fresh dill. It's still not great but I will give it 4 stars because with good lox I imagine it would be awesome.

I bought smoked salmon from Trader Joe's and was looking for an easy spread recipe.  This is IT!!!  I omitted the roe, and added one finely sliced scallion.  Served with an assortment of whole grain crackers, this elegant and delicious mousse was the star of the party.  Even my children (13, 11, 8, and 2) loved it!

Excellent recipe.  I lined small ramekin dishes with thinly sliced smoked salmon(as previously suggested by a reviewer), filled with the mousse, folded the edges over, then left to chill.  It makes an excellent starter. When I turned them out on to small plates I garnished them with a small sprig of fresh dill on top and wedge of lemon on the side.

This was so delicious.  I omitted the roe and made many of the changes other reviewers suggested: used slightly less cream cheese, threw in a couple small cloves of garlic, added a little more cream, and used fresh dill instead of dried.  I put in at least a tablespoon of chopped fresh dill, but the taste was still pretty subtle.  I also used the little fillo cups, but plain old crackers work just fine, too.

This was very yummy.  I made it as listed (although I ommitted the salmon roe garnish).  I doubled the recipe and used half full-fat cream cheese and half light cream cheese.  I'm sure it would work just fine using either one on its own.  It's much easier to mix if you leave the cream cheese out to soften for at least an hour ahead of time.  I tried to put it through my food processor but it didn't work at all - although it did a great job of pulverizing the salmon.  Oh, and I used fresh dill as my dried dill is about a hundred years old.

Wow. Super easy. I used partially-cooked smoked salmon, which my grocer only had in 3 oz. and scaled back the recipe. Turned out fabulous! I didn't change a thing, though next time I will experiment with horseradish and tobasco, as some have recommended. Yum!

I have made this recipe exactly as written and also have made it adding thinly sliced scallions and omitting the roe.  It is a great dip.  I think it tastes better if you make it in advance and refrigerate it for a few hours before serving.

Didn't do the lemon, just extra whipping cream and added a clove of garlic- delicious nonetheless!

I followed the recipe, but added a clove of garlic as others have suggested. It was quick, easy and tasted great.

This was a big hit at my housewarming party. I made this and a liver pate, and this was a better recipe, bar none.

Great.  Omitted the roe (didn't have any) and added chopped red onion & capers after I removed it from processor.  A great bagel spread!

Delicious!!!!  I left out the roe since I didn't have any on hand, but it was still wonderful.  Would definately make for company to go with a cracker and cheese plate.

Not sure whether the ingredients are a little different here in England as I made this as stated and it came out extremely salty.  It's a good basic recipe though and I will make it again but substitute fresh cooked salmon for some of the smoked.

This is an excellent recipe and AKANancy's suggestion is good as well as the addition of a little horseradish. If you like smoked salmon, you will love this!

This was really tasty! I used the juice from a whole lemon and omitted the roe (too expensive). Since my favorite bar stopped serving their delicious "smoked salmon pate", I've been trying to find a recipe that is similar. This is by far the closest; thanks so much!

This was a huge hit with my family for Thanksgiving. Served as part of a Charcuterie board along with capers, pickled onions, toast squares and other various selections for a "mini bagels and lox" offering. The only modification I made was too add a tablespoon more cream for a slightly smoother texture. Will definitely make again!

Amazing only change put in food processor not blender.  Use veggies and whole wheat crackers.

I thought this was very good. The only change I made was I omitted the roe and only used half the amount of dill. I brought home a can of smoked salmon from my recent trip to Alaska and this recipe really highlighted the delicious flavor of the salmon. I served it to friends and it was a hit. Thank you, Rob

Super easy to make, delicious! I did not use full fat cream, I used a lower fat one and didn't add too much cream cheese. Still absolutely amazing! I could not find dill so substituted celery seeds, again, amazed by the taste!
