This is the quickest thing I have made for dinner in a long time.  However, I like my chili on the thicker side, and this chili was a little too watery.  To solve this problem, I added half a can of tomato paste, and this made it perfect.  I also added just a little extra chili powder because I wanted it to be a little spicier.  Because I didn't have stewed tomatoes, I used canned diced tomatoes instead.  They were just as good and gave the chili a nice flavor.  I have already made this for dinner twice, and I plan on making it a staple in my recipe collection.  It's great served with a portion of baguette.

Wow!!! This chili was GREAT.  This was my first time EVER to make chili.  I added a chopped green pepper and 2 cloves of garlic minced in the pan with the hamburger and onions..  I also used 1 tablespoon of chili powder.. This truly was better than any chili my family has ever had from any restaurant or family member.. Thank you so much.

It has snowed 5 feet here in Denver and I really wanted chili tonight. I can't believe how easy this was!!! It was sooooooooooooo good. I can't believe it. I tastes like I worked all day on it. I did make a few changes, I only put 1c. of water, and put about 1TB of chili powder. When I browned the meat I put 2 cloves of garlic in with onion. This was the tastiest dinner I've had! Thanks!

It was good, although I had to make too many changes to the recipe to rate it any higher. I used alot more garlic and chili powder(1-2 tbsp) and I omitted the water completely(I like it thick and it was just too soup-like with the water in it). As the recipe is now it was very bland tasting.

I decided to make chili dogs at the last minute for National Hot Dog Day, I needed something fast. This fit the bill perfectly. I increased the chili powder and garlic powder and added a few more spices (cumin, mexican oregano, crushed red pepper, onion powder, little brown sugar, little Worchestershire sauce) for flavor. This worked out great.

This is an easy and simple chili recipe. I used petite diced tomatoes. I usually throw in garlic and green pepper. I use a TON more chili powder than called for here. We like it spicy! We serve this with shredded cheese and sour cream. The kids like to have this over fritos. Every once in a while I will serve this as a taco salad with corn chips and all the fixins.

I don't see how anyone can rate a recipe 4-5 stars when they have to practically redo it.  I added this, I left out that...put in more seasoning, leave out the water...either a recipe works or it doesn't AS IS.  This is a basic starter recipe for new cooks or families w/ young children. It doesn't qualify as 4-5 stars in my book.

This was so easy to make, and tastes great!! My husband and I both loved it!  I only had marinara sauce on hand so I used that in place of the tomato sauce.  AND I had to cook the chili a lot longer than 15 minutes to get it thick enough. I'll definitely be making this one again, but I think I'll add less water next time around...

It is really simple and tastes great.  I agree it's a great basic recipe and you can at to it.  No water and used petite diced tomatoes.  I added more chili powder and red pepper flakes to spice it up.  The second time I made it I browned the meat and onion then put that and the rest of the ingredients in a crockpot to simmer.  Works well.  Next time I'd like to add bell peppers.

FINALLY... a chili recipe i can use and eat lol. ive tried 2 other chili recipes off this site, made one as is and it was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too hot.  that one got tossed out the window.. the other takes a lot of ingredients and is very time consuming.. i love chili and this was perfect.. i added 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of 1 and 1 of stewed tomatos as im not a fan of tomato bits.. (ewww), and 2 cans of beans... thought it was a little on the watery side but thats an easy fix for next time.. i also did add a little bit more garlic and chili powder than a pinch.. just seemed to me that a pinch wouldnt be enough to season it all.. and also threw in some ground cumin seed because it felt like it was missing something.. that did the trick.. put some doritos (no fritos in australia), cheese and sour cream on top and it was absolutely delicious.. who cares if its only a starter recipe.. it beats going to the store, paying all that money for all the ingredients to make a "better chili" only to find out that its insanely hot and you cant even eat it so it just goes to waste.. gives me something to toy with to make it even better.. so you get 5 stars from me for giving me an awesome base... i normally just used those carrol shelby packets but those arent sold in australia either lol so ive spent the last year and a half trying to find a decent chili recipe that i could mess around with to suit my tastes.  this one is definitely it

This is not an entry into some chili cook off.  I would review it entirely differently if it were. With some minor tweaks, this is a tasty, cheap, fast and easy meal without a doubt. Like others have reviewed, it's definitely a base recipe.  I doubled the recipe. It lacked a kick and in my opinion was just on the verge of being bland. I made the following change and it made a hit at the table. Replace the half of the tomato sauce with a mexican tomato canned sauce called Salsa de Chile Fresco. Salsa de Chile Fresco is a tomato sauce with the ingredients : fresh chiles, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and garlic. This gives it just enough kick and flavor to get the taste buds working without killing your guests or your kids. Of course if you already have these ingredients, just add them to your sauce, but sticking to the theme of EASY is the goal here. I also used 3 cans of kidney beans as 2 cans was not enough to offset 2lbs of ground beef. Don't forget I doubled the recipe.  Serve with tortilla chips. Objective met!

As written I would rate as 4, however with the changes I made it was a 5. First, I never put beans in my chili, that is almost a sin. I added minced garlic instead of powder and I used a clove of this. I added a tablespoon of chili powder and used a teaspoon of cumin. I used chili-ready tomatoes which have some seasoning included and only an 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I decreased the water to 1 cup rinsing the tomato sauce can and tomato can out with this water. This makes a nice thick bowl of red; add sour cream and shredded cheese to the bowl and you have a wonderful meal. Oh, also make a skillet of cornbread and enjoy.

I had to tweek the receipe so much that it was no longer this receipe. This receipe was very bland and watery.  I added a small can of paste, 2 garlic cloves, then I added a harty pinch of onion powder along with a teaspoon of red crushed pepper flackes, 3 TBLS of chili powder, two pinches of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. I also added 1 teaspoon of orgeano. Then after it simmered we ate it Cicinnati style with spagettie, raw onions, loaded with chedder cheese and some hot sauce. My chili is not ultra spicey but we want to taste some spice with our chili.

As others have said, this is a good BASIC receipe.  We definitely had to jazz it up with more salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder and hot sauce.  Even then, it was just OK but I give it 3 stars since it's so easy/quick/cheap to make.  As others have noted, unless you want Chili soup, do NOT add the extra water.  We omitted the water, drained the beans and it was still a little soupy.

This chili was a huge success.  I made this for a church supper when I got off work.  It was very simple and quick to make.  I only used 1/2 cup of water and added more chili powder than was called for.  Thank you for this recipe.  Even the children loved this and a lot of people were asking for the recipe.  I have never taken something to a social without trying it first, but this was a success!!!!  I don't think you will go wrong with this one!!!

The basics are good..however I used diced tomatoes, used italian meat sauce adds deeper flavor, cumin, more chili powder and only used water to thin out...but it was still thick I added about a 1/2 cup. Simmer on low for an hour for richer more intense flavor.

I just tried this recipe and it was extremely bland based on the serving size of 6. I believe the measurements for the chili powder, salt and pepper, and garlic powder were extremely weak so I added probably a total of 4 tsp of chili powder and garlic powder. Taste much better!

A great base made even greater by a few changes. Added cumin, way more chili powder, celery, green peppers and a few whole garlic cloves. Omitted the water. Added green onions, sour cream and cheddar for topping. Cooked for about 20 min longer than suggested (uncovered).

Thanks for such a quick, simple recipe. I doubled it, put in 1 quart each of home-canned sauce and diced tomatoes. Used fresh garlic. Delicious!

We omitted the beans when my friends and I made this chili.  We had it with tortilla chips and saltines. This was a really easy and simple recipe. Next time when I make this I'll probably add in some more vegetables like green peppers and corn. Great recipe to customize!

Some changes made: added chopped green pepper & garlic, left out water, added 2 cans stewed tomatoes, two cans chili beans, used 1 1/2 Tablespoons Chili Powder. Was a lot of liquid, so I did have to simmer for about an hour.  Really good chili, like a cross between Steak N Shake's chili and Wendy's Chili. Sprinkled quite a bit of Monterey Jack shredded cheese on top of bowls. Served this with "Sweet Cornbread Cake" also from this website!

It was ok although much too soupy and very bland, I added a lot of extra garlic powder, chili powder, and salt. I also recommend that you season the meat and onion with the garlic and chili powders then add the other ingredients.

It didn't taste bad but it's not what I would call chili.  You end up with too much liquid.  It's more like chili soup than a hearty chili.  Also the pinch of chili powder leaves you with almost no chili taste.

I was looking for a chili recipe and this seemed easy and had good reviews, but I was sadly mistaken. It didn't have much flavor at all besides tomato, which might be good for some but my husband and I were looking for more of a chili that tastes like chili.

This recipe is really easy and tasteful! I did have to adjust the recipe a bit to love it. I used 5-6 table spoons of chili powder. added corn. added some jaleponos and green pepper and cumin. I really think the cumin really brought this chili to another level. Enjoy!

Very good and easy!!!  After I browned the ground beef and onion, I put all the ingredients in the crock-pot for several hours.  I served it with Frito corn chips, lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and cheese on top. My family loved it! Great on a cold winter night!

Its an excellent chili recipe, the amount of seasonings need to be adjusted to your liking though. I mix elbow noodles in after its done cooking. My kids love chili mac.

This is a good basic recipe, but who uses a pinch of chili powder in chili?  I added 2 tablespoons and a tablespoon of cumin.  Plus, I added fresh garlic (4 cloves), 2 tablespoons of sugar and a tablespoon or two of sugar.  So, I really shouldn't be reviewing it, but the other ingredients are perfect.  You decide.

If prepared as the recipe states you will end up with a watery and bland chili. Definitely not worth the rating it's been given. Too many people are rating it high but at the same time adding their own variation.

Good base but VERY bland as is. You definitely have to make this your own and build on it. After tasting it as is, I decided to add chopped green peppers, minced fresh jalapeno, increase the chili powder and garlic powder to 2 tsp each. I would also use petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. I served the chili with sour cream, cheddar cheese, green onions, sliced fresh jalapenos and my absolute favorite cornbread - Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site. *Added 2 minced garlic cloves and used S&W seasoned Chili beans. Simmer longer. Very good with the additions.

Fast, Easy, Delicious... It's a great starter recipe... I used ground bison and Canneli beans.  I made it twice in 2 weeks and ate leftovers for lunch... Still not tired of it.  A great cold weather option!

I am giving the recipe its self 4 stars however I turn it into what I would like to think as 5 stars.  Its a great base recipe but I make some easy changes.  I only add 1/2-1 cup of water and a small can of tomato paste as well as a ton of chilli powder...as in 1/3 of the bottle.  I also have started adding some cayenne pepper to give it an extra kick and the fire-roasted petite diced tomato instead of the stewing tomatoes.  Its fabulous with some cheese and raw onion (not sauted with the beef) after its done.  YUMMM!!!

This was my first chili and I couldn't have chosen a better recipe for my first one! It was easy, quick and so delicious! The only thing I did differently was that I used fresh garlic. I'll definitely pass this one along.

This is a great and very easy recipe. I took the advice of others and omitted the water and instead of chili powder I used a bag of mild chili mix and instead of the garlic powder I used about half a teaspoon of minced garlic. I also used turkey, not beef.  I cooked about 10 minutes longer than the original recipe calls for, and without the lid (in the last 10 min.) on low/simmer. It turned out great, topped with cheese and sour cream.Yum. This recipe is a keeper. My hubby loves it too!

This was a good "start off point" but I added what most others said they added. I added ALLOT more chili powder because it tasted a little bland and I also added green pepper chopped up and minced garlic. This was a great Recipe for someone who as never made it before. I just added more for my own liking! Turned out great for the first time ever making chili

I agree with another rater - this does not qualify for a 5 or even a 4 star rating when you need to change most of the amounts and add other ingredients not listed.  This has no depth of flavor that you get from a long simmer chili.  There is no spice in it to speak of - may be great for little kids or folks with very plain taste but certainly this isn't for those real chili afficianado's out there.  I'd give it a zero or less if I could.  And why would you use stewed tomatoes?

Was disappointed after reading all the reviews. Was quite boring.  I didn't add the water, added some tomato paste to add thickness, and also used 1 green pepper.  It was tastey but dull with not a single hint of even the slightest kick.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it's a good starter recipe, but you have to spice it up a bit.  I used mexican chili beans instead of kidney beans.  I also added green pepper in mine.  Finally, instead of chili powder I used chili seasoning and didn't add any water.  It's runny enough with the tomato sauce and juices from the other canned items.  With these substitutes, it was very yummy.

Really great tasting chili and so easy to make! My husband and I have always made the kind of chili you cook all day, but we had chili cravings this evening and decided to look for a quick and easy recipe. We doubled the recipe (except the meat... used about 1.5 lbs.) and added a can of Ro-tel to spice it up a bit. We'll make this often, thanks Tobi!

Quite good chili.  I made it with ground turkey, and following others recommendations, I omitted the water, used fresh garlic, and a full Tablespoon of chili powder.  For kicks, I also added a dash of cumin and ground ginger.  All-in-all, it turned out very well.  I may have to make it again, this time with more spice.

Great Recipe For Beginners!!! This recipe was a very good recipe for basic good chili. We first of all did not use water . Secondly it adds a lot if you use a few pieces of garlic and always season to taste.. We used a LOT of chili seasoning.. Overall it is a very good starter recipe. Cooks up very fast!!!

Made this for dinner last night for my whole family. I loved it, very quick and easy. I didn't add as much water as recommend though. I also added red and orange peppers and quite a bit more chili powder than in the recipe. Paired it was some Ritz crackers and a bunch of shredded cheese and it turned out great and everyone liked it :)

This is my "go to" chili recipe.  I do reduce the water to just 1/2 cup because we like it thicker and I also add 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for an extra kick and 1 can of pinto beans in addition to the 1 can of kidney beans.  Top with cheese and serve with Honey Cornbread for a winning meal.  Make it in the crockpot on low for 4-6 hours works perfect too.  Allows the flavors to combine better that way.

I make a chili that is very similar to this one except I don't add water and I use about 1 tbls of chili powder and almost as much ground cumin.

I thought the addition of some tomato paste was needed and I also added some minced garlic to the browned meat. I like a spicier version, although my husband liked this mild chili. I also added cumin, to me this gives it the smoky depth of flavor I am looking for.
It is fast and easy to prepare and easy to tweak it to your own tastes. To make it more complete we sometimes serve it over cooked small elbow macaroni and top w/ a little grated monterey jack cheese.

I added another can of kidney beans and another can of diced tomatoes some hot sauce. It tasted like tomatoes till I put more garlic and chili powder in it. I like it spicy so I added some red crushed peppers It tasted pretty good its simple easy to make.

Used this recipe for my first attempt at making chili.  It was easy and quick.  It seemed a little watery and not much of bite but it was delish.  Servered over some whole wheat elbows and added a lil cheddar cheese on top.  It was better the 2nd day and will add some more spice for next time.  I froze half for later.

This recipe  is OK but not great. Having read previous comments, I omitted the water. The chili was still too soupy -- tomato soupy to be specific. And like other reviewers, I also added more spice with extra garlic powder, chili powder and red pepper. This recipe is OK for a quick, basic dish that can be alterred to taste.

My family loves chili and I love quick suppers, so we tried this, I did add a lot more chili powder, a dash of tabasco, as we like it hot, and when I browned the ground beef I added some diced pepper  with it, this was awesome, so easy, the kids and hubby loved it, I served it with some Jiffy cornbread which is also very quick and easy and we had a very filling, satisfying, delicious meal on a stormy night......

Really good!  I had to make a few substitutions because of what I had... I used tomato juice instead of sauce and skipped the water; I simmered about 45 minutes because I wanted the tomatoes to break down since my kids don't like to see them; I did used smaller diced tomatoes and  thickened with some cornstach and chicken broth... Added some cayenne for some kick! :)

I've made this similar recipe for years. I double the recipe except for the tomato sauce, use one can. Instead of water use 42 oz. can of tomato juice. Yes, it is soupy, but that's the way I like it. It is not con carne! Also, I add a lot of chili powder and a green pepper chopped. The tomato juice gives it a great flavor!

I was pretty surprised at how well this turned out, I tossed in a few more of my own spices, such as cumin, but really I didn't alter the recipe all that much.  I only used half an onion out of personal preference and only used 1/2 a cup of water as well.  I'll be making this again...and again.

Very easy, very good -- only complaint is that it doesn't make enough for seconds!  I was feeding four adults, and we pretty much scraped the pot clean (I didn't look closely at the servings in the recipe before I started).  I will double the recipe next time.  Increased chili powder and decreased water as others suggested, along with adding garlic cloves to the meat.  I don't like things very spicy, but I used just short of 1 T chili powder -- it was around 2-1/2 teaspoons, and it was the perfect amount of spice.  Served over Fritos, with cheddar and sour cream on top.  Yum!

This was a great start for an easy chili -- I added more chili powder, ketchup - about 1/4 cup (of all things), a bit of Worcestire - 2 shakes, and some garlic powder - 2 shakes.  Came out great for a chili dog for my son!  Thanks!

This is a good start for the base. But it needed more. With the beef I added ground pork. 3 cloves of garlic. I added one can of Pork & beans, instead of the kidney beans I used the bean medley.  I put in 1/4C. of chili powder as a pinch is really not enough for chili.  I also let mine simmer for just a bit over an hour to incorporate the flavors more.  It turned out really good this way. Thx.

won a chili contest with this!  Made it spicier by adding more cumin, though it's all to taste. 

This is an incredibly easy recipe that is great on a cool fall day to winter, after trekking out to get your tree.  

My family also likes it with either cooked elbow noodles or cooked brown rice, and homemade cornbread.  

Very delicious.

I had never made chili before tonight.  I don't like chili from a can, but I added some things to this recipe and it was the best and easiest chili.  I added less water, and more chili powder, plus my husband doesn't like onion, so I added onion powder.  We added cheese and ate with crackers and it was a great meal for such a cold night.

This recipe was super easy, but as with others I used less water and much more chili powder.  I also added fresh garlic with hamburger while cooking instead of garlic powder.  A tasty version of basic chili.

This is a great chili recipe as a tasty base. I made it first and followed only the instructions and it was tasty but a little watery. I remade it and tweaked it alittle. I added half green pepper and a clove of shallot as well as roasted garlic powder.I also added a pinch of paprika and bumped the chili powder to 1/2 tablespoon and added a 1/4 cup of chopped fresh cilantro and 1/2 can of tomato paste. It was truly a wonderful dish and I topped it with shredded cheddar and a some more fresh cilantro..Boom !!!

I definitely added the tomato paste and of course, I've never just added a pinch of anything to any of my recipes. If you want your dish to be seasoned properly, you need more than a pinch, so I end up doing a whole lot of tweeking on this one. However, everything else was good.

This was the best chili I've ever made. It's also the only chili I've ever made. lol. I wanted  some homemade chili & I saw this recipe. The 1st time I made it, it was delicious but it wasn't enough. Making it again now for the 2nd time & I used 2lbs ground beef instead of 1lb, also more seasonings and no water and it's even better than before. YUM!

Loved the recipe!!! I used more seasoning because the  recipe seasoning was a little bland. I added some cayenne pepper to make it more spicier. Instead of chopping up a onion i used seasoning blend, and used pinto beans instead of kidney beans. Overall great recipe but you must change things up to fit you better.

This recipe was a great place to start. I had never made chili before so it was very easy. I added more chili powder and garlic, and a bit of worchestershire sauce crushed red pepper and slap ya mamma spice to it.

Seriously YUM. I'm pregnant, and I was looking for something simple and quick to make for dinner. I think I found my go-to crave meal. I'm sure it would have been great with the recipe followed to a T, but I did add less water- probably should have omitted it completely. What really sealed the deal for me was pouring it over Fritos and sprinkling Colby jack cheese on the top with some extra chili powder. My husband liked it too. I'm making it again this week, double batched. And I'll need a bigger bag of Fritos.....

Yes, I tried it, it's good.  I added a can of diced green chilies and a can of pinto beans, I wasn't sure if I should add juice from pinto bean can, but I did?  I added more than a pinch of chili powder, added to my taste, because it was a little to much tomato sauce taste.   All worked out good.

Loved it! This was so easy to make. I did make a few small changes. I substituted the ground beef for diced steak, and diced roasted tomatoes instead of the stewed, also added some Chopped green chili peppers and cayenne pepper. I had never made chili before so I wanted to start with something easy. It turned out perfect. Thank you! Thank you!

I had never made my own chili before, and I found this recipe.  I knew that I wanted to make my own recipe, but I had no idea how to get started.  This was a GREAT base to show me how to get started!  I added green pepper, celery for color, a lot more chili powder, cumin, minced garlic to the meat browning, a dash of seasoned salt, more beans, and diced tomatoes, and tomato paste to thicken.  No water either.  I think it turned out amazing, and my kids, who usually hate chili, LOVED it!  Thanks for the starting block!

Incredibly quick and very tasty. My boyfriend and I love Prego so I used that for the base.  I had enough leftover for TWO days of lunches.  I will defiantly be making this again!

I made this for my fiance and friends tonight. They liked it! I did modify the recipe to taste. I added a can of tomato paste per another member's suggestion and omitted the water. I also only used 1/2 of an onion and added more chili powder. I will be making this again.

This recipe is good but why so stingy with the chili powder and garlic powder?  It needs a good tablespoon or more of chili powder and I would used a couple of minced fresh garlic cloves.

This is my first chili making attempt. It was easy, fast, and mighty good tasting. I added more chili powder, chili flakes, Worcestershire and I only use Perrin. I used diced tomato, throw in whatever you like, to taste and you won't go wrong with this. I had garlic bread with it, next time I'll do the cornbread. yum

Good as it is but I prefer to use "chili beans" which are pinto beans seasoned with chili flavoring already. You can use dry minced onion instead of fresh and it works too. I like to keep all the non-perishables on hand for a quick and easy meal anytime.

I've been making this recipe for a while now and just have to say it is so good!! I have had many different kinds of chili and I wouldn't dare criticize this one based on another recipe. It is either good or not, you would either eat it or not, period. I think if you are looking for fast and easy and not a lot of ingredients then this is a great choice. You can leave it as is or if you wanted to you could dress it up even more. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Tobi!

I thought this recipe is good for a starter on the basics of making chili. I added a lot more to it like chopped green bell peppers, cumin, and some other spices that I can't think of at the top of my head. Anyways, you can do so much more to your chili based on what you like, so overall this was a great starter recipe for me :-) Thanks!

Doubled the tomatoes and beans, and added 1/2 can tomato paste. Also used 2 Tbs chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, and a pinch of paprika. Tasted great with macaroni, and even better the day after. Definately a keeper.

This was very easy. I soaked and used dried beans, about twice as many as the recipe called for. I also used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. italian sausage, taken out of the casing. As a spice, I used Cajun seasoning.

Great basic recipe to embellish...I needed more chili powder (plus some cayenne and cumin), used beef broth and beer for the liquid and had some tomato paste I needed to use up instead of the tomato sauce.  Not a four because it needed something else, esp. written as is, and I'm not sure I got it right this time.  Again, great base recipe.

Easy, yes, but I thought it was pretty bland. I used 1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and plenty of salt - plus I added 1.5 teaspoon ground cumin, generous dashes of hot sauce, and even a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce. I also omitted the water and just used a 28oz can of stewed tomatoes.

This was very easy to prepare, however I had to add a lot to it. I added green pepper and more seasonings and even a good helping of Tabasco sauce. I didn't even use water and it was still too soupy.

This chili was a very good starting point.  As a busy college student it was incredibly easy and quick.  Here are some of the changes I made; 1 extra can kidney beans (or more/ other beans if you prefer)

This recipe was very simple and easy. It tasted delicious for an easy quick meal. It was great to make after i got homw from work, it was fast and delicious. You may want to add something beacuse it was not very thick. but my family in the end loved it and it lasted for lunch the next day.

This recipe is very similar to my own that was passed down to me from my mother. One difference is that we always add a can of ranch style beans along with the kidney beans which gives it a rich texture and awesome flavor! Also a little more chili powder and a pinch of cumin to spice it up a bit.

This is pretty much my basic chili recipe, however I add garlic - at least 3 cloves and at least 1 tablespoon of chili powder and 1/4 tsp. of Cayenne as I like my chili spicier. I will also use different beans - dark kidney or black beans, depending on what's on sale. I like simmering the chili a lot longer than 15 minutes to give the flavors time to meld. Much better the second day, of course!  Sprinkle with grated cheese and it's dinner!

This was so easy to make. I made this for 12 servings. I added 2 bell peppers, red and green, and 2 cans of tomato paste and let it simmer for 2 hours for thickness.

This is a simple easy chili.  I did add one extra small can of tomato sauce because I liked it saucier.  I added 1 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp garlic powder along with a 1/2 teaspoon of basil.

It is a good base recipe.  I omitted the tomato sauce in place of tomato paste.  I added 1 tbsp of cumin, and about 1 tblspn ancho chili pepper spice.  I used Bush's chili beans, undrained, in place of the other beans, which gave it even more flavor.  If you like to spice up your chili this is a good recipe for an advanced cook who can jazz it up.

This was a home run with my family. I had to double up on the recipe (family of 5 & 3 are teenage boys) and everyone LOVED this chili. I made a couple small changes to it because I had a couple items on hand that I thought would be great in it. I added diced green pepper (1 whole), diced red bell pepper (1 whole), minced garlic (about 2 TBLSP), I used about 2 TBLSP of chili powder, I only used 1 cup of water and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes to make it nice a chunky. It was very, very delicious. Everyone really enjoyed it. I also make a couple of loaves of corn bread and it was the perfect dish to make and watch football on Sunday. This is now a staple in my house.

Great and easy to make.  I found it comes out better if you do not add any water.  With the water it is a little too soupy for me.  Also, this is not a spicy chili, so plan on adding more chili power or something else like Tabasco to spice it up.

Had to change quite a bit, added flour to thicken, did not use water or onions (fam doesn't like), and I added cumin and basically tripled the chili powder. this came out delicious after i tweaked it! i also used half the tomato sauce and added chili beans.

Delicious! My hubby the cook also sauteed red peppers, and green onions with the ground beef. He also seasoned the beef with an old family recipe before adding to the veggies. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe, I changed a few things myself but it is easy to do. I did'nt add any water, and I added stewed tomatoes with the tomato sauce, and I added kidney beans AND pinto beans. It was great with both beans. Try this recipe, you can't go wrong with any variation.

Easy and Tasty!  The first time I made it I just couldn't get enough of it.  I kept going back for more.  I make it once a week now.  I add about a Tablespoon of garlic and chili powder instead of a "pinch."  And I leave out the water since I use a crock pot.

I had never made chili before, but wanted to try it since it is one of my favorite meals. But I knew there were many recipes out there that required a lot of ingrediants. So I wanted to start simple. All of the ingrediants (not including spices) cost me only $6.40. I only used 1/2 cup of water instead of the 1 1/2 it called for. I was amazed at how good this turned out. I loved it! Will definately be making again!!!!

This is a good recipe for a chili base.  We added a little more seasoning at the end because it seemed a little bland for our tastes.  I will keep this recipe and maybe add some of our own likes to it (mushrooms, extra tomatoes, etc...).  Thanks for the post!

This recipe gets four stars for flavor - it needs a bit of jazzing up, but definitely good for using mostly canned ingredients.  However, I gave it a fifth star because you really can't beat this recipe for speed and ease.  It took me about ten minutes to brown the beef and throw the rest of the ingredients in.  For the flavor I get for 10 minutes worth of work, it's definitely worth 5 stars!  I like that this recipe uses ingredients we normally have on hand.  I wanted something fast, easy and hearty today and that's exactly what I got.  I'll make a pan of cornbread and we'll have a fabulous dinner!

This is one of the best Chili,s I have ever eaten. My 8 year old daugther loved it. The only thing I changed is a dash more Chili Power and added 1 pinch of Cumin. Have this with Jalapeno Corn Bread.

I tripled the recipe so I would have leftovers. I added 3 chopped green peppers and 3 cloves minced garlic to ground beef (almost 3 lbs ground beef). I used three 15-Oz cans diced tomatoes instead of stewed, two  15 Oz cans Goya pink beans without the liquid) one 8 Oz can tomato sauce, one 8 Oz can tomato paste, no water.  I also added more chili powder and some cayenne pepper.  I prefer my chili a little on the spicy side. This was delicious served with cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream and Italian bread. I will definitely make this again

A pinch of chili powder does not make it chili. Add more chili powder (1 tbsp. or so) to the recipe, unless you want hamburger soup. After adding additional chili powder and using spicy beans instead of regular chili beans, it was delicious. Served it with corn chips and cheese and it was very good.

Hey someone 's been looking in my recipe cards! The only change to mine is more chili powder. Occasionally I will chop up a medium green bell pepper to add to the chili pot, and maybe chop a couple cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. Still this is the simplest of my comfort food recipes.

I made it but substituted chili beans for kidney beans. I also used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of adding water. It is easy and so good. Just what one needs on a cold winter's night.

Very easy recipe. I did not add the water and I added 1/2 can tomato paste. Probably could omit the paste if leaving out water. Also used approx. 2 tablespoons of chili powder. Family loved it!!

This was really simple to make and turned out better than I would have thought! I ended up buying the wrong chili powder, so I used garlic salt, onion powder, and cumin for flavor. It was definitely more than a pinch, I like food to be flavorful. Additionally, I swapped ground beef for ground turkey to be more health conscious.

Everything worked well except for the water — I'd skip that or significantly reduce it unless you like your chili very watery. Also, I'd probably add more chili and garlic powder depending on how you define "pinch."

Overall it was simple and easy to make however, I only used about 3/4 of a cup of water because I wanted it to be thicker and I used a whole lot more chili  and garlic powder because it tasted too much like tomato sauce. I also added a pinch of cayenne because I like spicy chili. It’s delicious though!!

Taste was great, but very watery. Next time I plan on taking out the water and possibly draining the stewed tomatoes as well.

Followed every step of the recipe but it ended up tasting more like a tomato soup and really runny. Maybe I’ll try again but add more chili powder.

So the original recipe needs some adjustments but it's an amazing base, forgo the water if you like it thick. My additions Cummin, paprika, sazson seasoning, corn, fresh garlic. Toppings cilantro, cheese and sour cream.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. It was quick easy and very tasty. In the future I may play around with the seasonings a bit. Great dinner choice for something tasty and quick after work.

I’m shocked at all the 5 star ratings on this recipe. Without adding a lot of extra chili powder and seasoning to this recipe it would taste like a tomato stew. Good base to work off of though.

It was okay as a base, but tasted very sweet in my opinion. I added A LOT of chili powder, some cayenne, cumin, and lime juice to cut the sweetness.

I have made this chili for years. Honestly this recipe is a great starter. I recommend adding to it over time by reading comments below or making it with friends. Personally I add to above in the 2nd and 3rd step, can of black beans, can of pinto beans, jar of desired salsa (medium for me), can of corn, diced up green pepper, pinch of cumin, minced garlic instead of dry garlic, 1/2 or more can of tomato paste to thicken, and a pinch of cinnamon. Will make more servings than before. For extra fun and flavor, add tortilla chips (with a kick of lime) crushed up, cheese (cheddar, Mexican mix, etc. It’s cheese, how can you go wrong?), and a bit of sour cream.

One pinch of chili powder does not make chili. This is hamburger/bean soup with tomatoes. On the plus side, it certainly is easy.

I think this is a great starter chili recipe that you can customize.  I used the following substitutes - quorn meat (don't use if allergic to eggs),  pink beans, 2 cloves of garlic and 1 cup of water.  I added cumin and used the remaining items on the ingredients list.  I wish I had cooked the onions by themselves as I prefer a softer onion.

I have read some of the reviews and who cares, if you have to revise it or make it your own it was a good solid starter chili recipe. Yes, I made some changes but I will say this it was the bomb my hubby and I love it! Here are my changes less water and I do agree more chili powder. Also, to help some of the acids I always put a pinch of sugar that was something my mother taught me!

Tonight is the third time I’ve made this. My boyfriend loves it and so do I. Although I put the actual ingredients in it the first time and then made a double batch the second time. This time I tried something different. Instead of using kidney beans I used chili beans instead. I even put chili ready tomatoes in it along with a can of Rotel, put a couple bay leaves in it plus everything else. Top it with a lot of cheese and oyster crackers.... yum!! ??

To me this is a phenomenal starting recipe.  With chili you can easily add, substract, tweak.   The chili powder amount was only reason I did 4 instead of 5 stars.  Chili is one of those everyone customizes to taste. You get it going, you taste and add. But chili...you have to have chili powder, otherwise you are making a meat soup basically.   I never add beans, I added 3 TB chili powder and all the seasonings plus bit of cumin and a lot of extra garlic powder (we LOVE garlic) and some garlic salt.  Also, we like our chili thick, so added one small can of tomato paste.   I added just a little bit of brown sugar for a hint of sweetness.   Will always use this as my starter recipe.

This is made for someone who is NOT a person who enjoys REAL chili con carne, First, one should use a rough chili grind of beef, not ground beef 80/20 or more.
Second, this recipe does not have enough of the necessary seasonings. For each pound of chili grind, one should start with 1 heaping T. Of chili powder, 2 heaping  T. Of ground  cumin, or comino powder, 1T. Garlic powder and one T. Of onion powder.
You can add cooked pinto beans if you like but please, don't  add any kind of tomato product. Tomatoes, IMHO, ruin the flavor an d they are not authentic.  
Third, after the meat has been drained and browned WELL, So after mixing in the seasonings seasonings, one should add 1/2 bottle of any kind of beer that you like, 2 T. a pple cider vinegar 
and stir well.
Finally, add 1c. Water, stir and set burner flame on very low to low. You will want this to barely simmer for 2 hours.
When finished, place in a bowl while very hot; add Colby or Jack or both to the hot chili,  green onion, sour cream.
Enjoy!

I loved this recipe! I would have given it five stars but the pinch of chili powder stopped me. I added a tablespoon of chili powder to my recipe and my gang still added hot sauce to it. I will definitely be making this one again and again.

We made a double batch. I added a lot more garlic and chili powder. I also added some cinnamon which was nice. I would cook fresh garlic cloves with the meat next time and then add the other yummies.  I liked the stewed tomatoes (I usually used crushed). It gave a great texture. Thanks for the recipe!!

I liked how fast and easy it was to make but I like my Chili thicker.  I added 2 tablespoons of flour into the 1 1/2 cups of (hot) water, but it was still a little runny.  I will try to use only 1 cup of water and add 3 tablespoons of flour the next time.

this is a good starter recipe for chili. the first time I made it was more watery than I like. I used 1.5 lb beef this time and one cup of chicken broth instead of 1.5 c water and it was the perfect thickness. I also added a table spoon of garlic powder instead of a "pinch". and a tablespoon of chili powder also. I added 2 jalapeno peppers and it turned out to be the perfect amount of spicy for me and my family. I would recommend this recipe as a starter recipe. you can play with the recipe and I like that about it. next time I want to add more peppers and maybe a different kind of meat.

Simple and straight to the point recipe. I decided against the canned kidney beans because I prefer packaged beans.

This recipe as ok, but I ended up making a lot of changes. I drained the fat from the beef as well as put a lot more garlic powder and chili powder about 1 1/2  tbps each, without it would be very bland, I also didn't add water and drained the juice out of the kidney beans otherwise it would have been extremely watery

Thanks for such a delicious chili recipe. I made it today February 5, 2017 for a chili contest at my church and I won second place.  I made the recipe with two pounds of ground beef, one and half of onions and no water needed.  I used Bush beans and hunt tomatoes.  The best thing my husband really liked it and he is a picky eater

OMG! This Chili was a hit in my home!!! It was easy to make and it was very delicious! I added a couple of my own ingredients for a little spice! but overall, this was my first time making chili and it was great! I paired this with baked potatoes. Put the chili on top of the potatoes with some cheese and sour cream and it was even better! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Good base recipe and I love how fast it is. I did tweak it like most others. I omitted the water, thought it would be too thin.  Then I added more garlic plus cumin, worcestershire , extra chili powder and crystal hot sauce. Very Happy!

Two stars as written.  I'm hoping 2 pinches of chili powder was a mistake.  I tried 2 pinches of chili powder and wound up adding another 1-2 tbsp of chili powder so it tasted more like chili.  Will not make this again.

This is the best ever chili recipe in my 50 years of cooking. Added one can pinto beans to recipe as well as diced green pepper, diced red pepper one half cup each and one fourth cup chopped celery.  Used one tablespoon of garlic salt and one tablespoon of  chili powder as well. I realize I have customized this a bit but it worked for me!!!

I make this all the time. I added a few changes. When I brown the meat and onions I add some chili powder and a little bit of brown sugar to it. It comes out amazing!! 

Also I like some color in it so I chop up some green red and yellow peppers and add them to it. And a tsp of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.

This is awesome, it's pretty much fool proof too.  I used a larger skillet instead of a medium.  I also omitted the water but left the rest the same.  The best part is everything is in proportion together, so a can of tomato sauce, a can of diced tomato's, 1 lb of beef, and an onion, and you don't waste any ingredients or have to worry about using to much of anything, everything synced together perfectly.

I don't cook much so when this turned out and I tasted it, I was like wow did I seriously just make something good.  Usually when I cook with more then 3 ingredients I mess up.  I could actually impress people with this.

I love this easy recipe, especially for one learning to cook. I added a bell pepper to it and half the water. I did not give it 5 stars because I need to know more about how much spices to put in other than pinch. My granddaughter loved this. It is a definite keeper.

I wish I had read the reviews prior to making this. It was so soupy, it was embarrassing as I had invited friends over for chili and football. I also increased the chili powder and garlic powder. I tried thickening it with tomato paste. No luck! It was OK with shredded cheese and sour cream.

This was a good base. Omitted the water, used 28 oz crushed tomatoes, added garlic, green peppers and beef stock. It was the quickest chili recipe I ever tried.

I made this today and I really enjoyed it, even eating it in a cup by itself. Yes I am greedy. The recipe itself made for a great quick fix. I did add some ketchup, some veg buillion, garlic, pimentos but the base of the recipe was great.

Great base recipe. My theory is that it's a lot easier to add to a recipe but pretty hard to take things out. I omitted the water since we like ours nice and thick. I added mushrooms, grated carrot, minced celery and about a tablespoon of chili powder. Turned out delicious. Everyone loved it, even my picky daughter.

This was my first attempt to make chili, and it's an appropriate day being cold and rainy. I used "homemade" pinto beans (i.e. bought them dry and cooked them), and didn't have any chili powder. Very good tasting, and I can't wait to have the leftovers (i heard chili is best the 2nd time around)

This was my first time making chili, so ease was a must. Not only was this easy, but this chili was the BEST I have ever tried. So hearty and DELISH! I served it with corn bread. I personally decreased the water but still gave this recipe a five star rating because thickness is according to personal preference.

This was the tastiest chili I have ever made - but I added some things: half a red bell pepper, chopped; half a green bell pepper, chopped; one jalapeno pepper, chopped; 10 oz. of frozen yellow corn kernels; one packet of chili mix (in lieu of the chili powder), and extra garlic powder (probably about 1 or 1.5 tsp). I also did one cup of beef broth plus 1/2 cup water, instead of 1.5 cups water. I served with corn muffins, cheddar jack cheese, and saltines. Delicious!

SUPER EASY RECIPE! The only changes I made were omitting the water, draining and chopping the stewed tomatoes, adding MUCH more chili powder, and a little tabasco (I like it spicy). I served it with cornbread. Yummy!

Great, easy to make chili. Very easy to customize! We added cinnamon for a different flavor (try just a dash or two). We left out the water, as others suggested and it still had plenty of water from the other ingredients. This chili isn't very spicy, so we tripled the seasonings. It was still a bit on the weak side, but nothing that seasonings can't fix. Next time, we'll use half an onion (one whole onion makes the soup primarily onions--I'd rather have more beans, personally). Really tasty. Will make again because it's so simple and comforting.

Very easy recipe.  I left out the water and added a small can of tomato paste and a can of mushrooms so it would be thick.  Also added a lot more chilli powder than the recipe called for.  Tasted even better the next day.  Will definately make this once again!

I used tenderized stew meat and Ranch style beans with jalapenos because we like warm chili. This is a GREAT "starter" recipe. We ate it while we watched the Superbowl...superbowl/super chili bowl.

Very good!!  I added cumin and brown sugar and some roasted red peppers.  I simmered on the stove for a few hours, because I had a lot of time before dinner.  SO easy to make, will make again.  Very inexpensive recipe, THANK YOU!!

easy easy... i made 2.4 lbs and didnt up the spices, beans.  Which has caused it to be bland.  My man spiced it up though.  More chili powder, roaster sause (we like it hot), onion salt, and a can of mixed geen chilies.

Easy quick basic chili recipe. I agree with previous reviewers that the recipe as written is pretty bland/ boring. To doctor it up, I followed others' suggestions and added a few of my own: 1) DO NOT add any extra water; 2) drain excess water from beans or other canned vegetables as necessary (I added canned sliced carrots and corn); 3) add as much seasoning to taste, including chili powder, chili flakes (I like a good amount of "kick"), ground black pepper, salt, and basil; 4) serve with sour cream, shredded sharp cheddar, guac, corn bread/ tortilla chips/ saltines.   Also, I actually had to simmer mine for about 30 min, not 15. Even without adding any water, it was still way too thin for my tastes.

This is a great recipe for fast chilli. I use it as a base and add extras when i have more time. Bacon bits, mushrooms, celery, other variety of beans, and other veggies are great to add to this chilli when you have more time to doctor it and make it your own. Just remeber to add more water or tomatoe sauce to keep it soupy

this was good and easy for a fast weeknight meal.  I still prefer my slow cooked version but when I am short on time I will use this one.  I topped with chedder cheese, onions and sour cream. I also served with broiled cheese bread.  I didn't have cornbread mix otherwise I would've served with that.

I was planning to make a chili from a packet one night and decided I wanted something a little tastier.  I didn't have everything this needed, but I used what I had.  I didn't have onions, so I used onion flakes.  I didn't have the kinds of tomatoes they talk about, so I used diced tomatoes.  Also, I took others' advice and added more chili powder.  I was so happy I chose this over the packet - it tasted so much better!

Very easy recipe! It is similar to the one I already use. I added a few ingredients to spice it up, but it was great the way it was for the kids. They loved it with a little melted cheese and sour cream on top.

My secret favorite ingredient to add to all my tomatoe-based sauces and soups is brown sugar. I makes the flavor more rich and takes the edge off the acidity. I usually start with 1/2 tsp. and add more according to taste if it needs it. This was a good basic chili. I revised it a bit by adding green peppers, diced tomatoes in chili sauce, only 1/2 cup of water and more chili powder than called for.  This was quick and easy and I'll be making it again. Thanks!

This is an easy recipe but I made a few changes.  Instead of stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce I substatuted two cans of "Mexican Style Stewed Tomatoes" and I added about a tablespoon Texas Pete Hot Sauce along with more chili powder.

Very good! This is great for a quick recipe. You can't tell how quick it was made. We added bell pepper and jalapenos for an extra flavor kick and spice. It made enough for dinner for a family of 3 or 4

I added a packet of splenda, and omitted the water because I like it kinda chunky. I used MUCH more chili powder than mentioned, but use it to taste. Overall, I'll make again.

This recipe is really easy to make!
As a college student, it was simple and well laid out.  I tend to like chunkier chili so I put a little bit of water and used chunky tomato sauce used for spaghetti to get extra thickness.  Also, I put it with sour cream, cheddar cheese and some cilantro just for kicks.

WOW...I can't believe how easy this chili was to make and my husband and his friends loved it, they all had seconds!!! I did use fresh garlic and a sweet onion.  This was my test pot, I am going to be making a huge batch of it for our house warming party this weekend.  I will be putting this one in the keep box!!  Happy cooking!!!!

I absolutely love this recipe. It's simple and inexpensive to make, you can whip it up in minutes or let it simmer for hours. When I don't have fresh onion I use onion powder which turns out just as great. I also use diced tomatoes instead of stewed per my husband's preference. This one is a favorite, beats my mother-in-law's recipe. (Now if only I could beat her cornbread!)

This is delicious. I use a 28 oz. can of diced tomates instead of a 14.5 oz can. I also let all the ingredients simmer on the stove for 2-3 hours, it lets all the flavors blend. I make this all the time.

I liked this recipe because I had all the ingredients in stock.   I used a can of Ranch Style beans instead of kidney. (personal preference)  I added one can condensed tomato soup which gave it a nice consistency.  In addition to the spices listed, I added cumin, paprika and a little cayenne pepper to taste. Very nice on a cold fall day!

This is a really good basic recipe for chili. I put way more chili powder in, as well as thyme. In an unintentionally spicy version, I added Ro-Tel tomatoes & green chiles instead of the diced tomatoes, and put in lots of chili powder. I thought it was fantastic, but my husband sweated through the meal.
