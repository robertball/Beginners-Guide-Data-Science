This was a great recipe for using up some things I had, (chicken, spinach, eggs).  I made it without the crust to save some carbs.  Just mixed it all together and poured it all in my Pyrex pie plate sprayed with cooking spray.  I added one additional egg and a mixture of cheeses and it turned out great!

I tried this recipe for the first time.  Substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise, added a little extra sharp cheddar cheese and sauteed the sweet onions in about a teaspoon of bacon drippings before adding to the chicken/spinach mixture.  I used the advised amount of salt and pepper but substituted approx 1/4 tsp each of McCormick's Roasted Garlic & Herb Seasoning and 1/4 tsp of their Vegetable Seasoning Blend.  It filled up a deep dish pie crust to the brim and took 55 minutes to cook instead of 35 to 40 but it was delicious.  The flavor was perfect, not too salty.  My husband said he doesn't like spinach but he loved this quiche.

I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise as I thought I didn't have yogurt (which I always use in place of mayonnaise) and used white fish instead of chicken just for the heck of it and I liked the end result. A simple but tasty weeknight dinner.

This recipe was great! I replaced the mayo with sour cream and I sautéed the onion and then added the chicken to cook/heat and then I cooked down the spinach and added the cheese at the end. I seasoned it with onion and garlic powder and salt and pepper then I added it to the pie crust and cheese. It really turned out well. My family loved it and I will be making it again :)

This was delicious!! I'll make it again. I too saluted onion, garlic and spinach before putting into the crust. This made a 9 inch deep dish crust perfectly-no overflow.

My husband loved it! I didn't have any sweet onion, so I substituted purple onion. Mayo felt a bit heavy, so I'd like to substitute the Mayo for Greek yogurt next time (for the healthy perspective). Overall, this quiche reminded my husband of those winter days back home when his mom used to cook quiches. :) When I see my husband smile, I'm one happy wife. Therefore, this recipe is definitely a 5! Mouth-watering, moist, and delicious!

I discovered I was out of onions part way through the recipe so I added a can of green chiles and a dash of cumin and omitted the herbs. My picky teenage daughter had two pieces for dinner, one for a snack and the last piece for breakfast. I used chicken left over from a rotisserie chicken. Next time I will add some salsa on top.

Made this as a breakfast quiche, so I substituted hot seasoned sausage for the chicken and used cayenne pepper!   To up the heat factor, also substituted queso cheese dip for the mayo!

This was a simple recipe.  I added a sautéed in bacon grease mix of onion, mushrooms and zucchini  to the chicken, cheese and spinach mix and then crumbled bacon on top. Took longer to bake though that may be in part due to the stoneware pan I used

Love this recipe because it can be played with. I used chopped pastrami instead of chicken and add chopped carrot too. Yummy!

I had leftover ham rather than chicken and I had egg yolks left after making a dessert so I substituted the ham and added the yolks and an additional egg. Other than these few minor changes, I followed the recipe and both my family and overnight guests raved about the quiche. I served it with broccoli cheese soup that I also made from an Allrecipe contribution. It made a nice meal.

I made it and it was great. The only change I made was I added 2 tsp of "Slap Your Mama" seasoning instead of  all spice, I didn't have any on hand. I also made a double batch, 2 pies, and I'm glad I did, as the first disappeared in a flash. Only 2 slices left so I will find out tomorrow morning how it tastes warmed up.

Took about 15 minutes longer to cook for us. We also decreased the amount of onions, but that's personal taste. Was very good and my husband has informed me that I can make it again.

Needs extra baking time by at least 15 minutes.  Otherwise, good flavour.

Needed 40-45 minutes to set right. Added a pinch more of the Herbs de Provence. As always, you can never have too much spinach. lol.

Pretty good, but I'll need to play with the seasonings to give a bit more pizazz next time around.  I actually used a bit more of spinach, cheese and chicken, and it still all fit in a pre-made 9" deep dish crust.  I didn't have half and half, so substituted an equal amount of evaporated whole milk, and that worked just fine.  My 13 year old had seconds, which she almost never does!

Very easy and delicious quiche. I used some leftover rotisserie chicken and I substituted chard for the spinach. I also sautéed the onions and chard before mixing them with the chicken and cheese. It was very good and everyone liked it except for my 8 year old, who thought it tasted good but she didn't like the texture.

This was pretty good and my family really liked it.  I used buttermilk instead of half & half because that's what I had.  I like a little more egg than cream in a quiche but it did have a lot of flavor.
