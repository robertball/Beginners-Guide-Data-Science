I made some changes: 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/6 cup white sugar, ½ cup applesauce, 3½ TBS butter (made really soft, almost melted, in the microwave), 1 cup flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, maybe 1/4 tsp cinnamon (allergies in the house), one good shake of ground ginger, 1 cup oats, ½ cup Craisins, and about 1/4 cup Smarties (Canadian candies: like M&Ms, but MUCH better!). My daughter and I like to eat cookie dough (we SAMPLE it! It has to be good dough to make good cookies!), so it's nice that I don't have to worry about eggs. Oh, I also used parchment paper instead of greasing the sheets. It took them about 12 minutes in the oven, and they were a thicker, softer cookie. The ginger was a nice addition. One bit of advice to people complaining about 'cakey' cookies: Substitute some (or most, or all) of the baking powder with baking soda. Most chocolate chip cookies have soda but not powder, and think of what they turn out like. :) Thanks for sharing, Lucille!

Well, I decided almost 8 months ago to "change my lifestyle" by exercising and eating HEALTHY.  Currently, I have lost almost 50 lbs!  I made these cookies today and EVEN my unsuspecting 8 yr old son said they were "great".  Low fat/lower carb/HEALTHY eating and cooking can be GREAT with recipes like this one.

I thought this was a great low fat cookie.  I halved the all purpose flour and add 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  I also add a little more cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves and nutmeg.  I had to flatten my cookies though because they didn't spread as they cooked.

These were a great cookies for a family on a diet(who loves cookies). I had no apple sauce, but I heated up 2 apples (chopped)in the microwave for 2 minutes with a bit of water and mashed them up with the other ingredientas.  It worked great!

I have to say that these are the first cookies I've ever baked that can actually bounce!  I thought that not having any butter or margarine in the ingredient list was too good to be true! Sorry...but I thought that these cookies were rather gross.

I thought these cookies were a great snack for those trying to eat healthier. I didn't have any applesauce on hand so I used one mashed banana instead and added a little water to the mixture as it was quite dry once I mixed all the ingredients together. I also used whole wheat flour and all brown sugar. If I added some chocolate chips they may have turned out a little tastier but they are quite good for a mid-morning snack for those watching their waistline. I have an overactive sweet tooth so these are great to satisfy my cravings.

These cookies are really good! They are sweet yet not too sweet =]. My only problem with these is that they dont exactly expand when you put the drops on the cookie sheet...so what i did was mush them down into the size i wanted them to be or else they would seem really tiny.

AWESOME!!! Me and my husband love these cookies, I made them according to the recipe (without nuts)and they were great, I made them again with just 2 spoons of organic peanutbutter and they were unbelievable!!! I know it adds a little fat, so try to eat a little less (if you can...).

I really liked these cookies. They're pretty good for low fat. My parents even ate them and they usually hate anything low-fat I make. I ended up using 1 cup of appleasauce. I omitted the nuts but added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. This recipe is a keeper.

For me, these were pretty bland, but I did make them for my 15 month old who is allergic to eggs & nuts ( omitted the nuts).  He liked them. Thanks Lucille, for sharing so that he could have a variety.

I made this twice so far. The first time, I made them as drop cookies. It was so-so. But today, I made them using a 11x7 pan. It's fantastic. It's soooo much better when it's made in a bar form. Try it!

This cookies are deliciously soft and chewy. My boyfriend (who is allergic to eggs) and vegan friend absolutely loved them! I bake them for a couple minutes longer than the recipe calls for.

For a low fat recipe, these are FANTASTIC! most low fat recipes do not take away my sweet craving but these totally did! i used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of half and splenda white and brown sugar. i also added an extra teaspoon of baking powder. i will definalty make these again!

wow. These cookies are phenomenal. Even with the great reviews i was a little skeptical of cookies without eggs or BUTTER but they turned out great, still really soft and chewy. I have 2 things to note though,  First: i used baking soda instead of baking powder  like another reviewer suggested and they rose and fluffed a little, so i would suggest that alteration. Secondly, i got 14 cookies out of this which is way under the two dozen yield that the recipe shows. I didn't add raisins or walnuts so that may have cut down the amount of dough but if you want 2 dozen cookies, i would double the recipe. Overall I am so happy i tried this one, these cookies turned out AMAZING

Great low fat/low cal cookie.  I made exactly 24 (small cookies).  I used splenda, whole wheat flour, sugar-free applesauce, and baking soda instead of powder.  Cookies were delicious and I calculated about 50 per cookie.

Really good for a lowfat no egg no butter recipe! I loved it. Only change I made was to change 1 cup flour to 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular.

This cookie is really easy to make. I just made my first batch and found it a little dry. I may add a little more applesauce the next time. Overall it was a very tasty cookie for those of us who are watching our weight.

These make great breakfast treats on my way out the door! I added a bit more baking powder and vanilla, and substituted mixed dried fruit for just one kind.  I make these every few weeks and grab a few on my way to work!

I knew these cookies looked too good to be true.  The mystery is how they received four stars to begin with.  Do not--I repeat--do not make these cookies.  I decided I would rather strap on a feedbag and eat some oats raw than to eat these sorry excuses for cookies.

What a let-down! The batter was so tasty, but the final result is rubbery and kind of glutinous without really having much in the way of flavour. I could swear these things would bounce... If I didn't have an aversion to wasting food I would just pitch them, but they are edible. My advice: make regular cookies & replace half the butter w/applesauce, or just make them smaller & eat slowly.

Really tasty. The texture was not what I was expecting from a cookie. But once I got used to the texture I thought they were great. I made these with chocolate chips for my mom (allergic to eggs and dairy) when she came to visit and the rest of the family enjoyed them as well.

These were great!  Didn't have raisins on hand so I used Craisins.  My son liked them as well.  I made them with no salt for my husbands sodium intake. I am watching calories and these are such a treat for small amount of calories.

I found it! I am on Weight Watchers and am on the hunt for a good cookie recipe. I followed this recipe almost completely. I used 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour and sifted it twice. I used unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and a 1/2 of a 70% dark chocolate bar, chopped up. I made cookies the size of quarters (I flattened them out a little w/ my finger before baking) and at this size, you can have 7 of them for 2 points!!!! I personally would rather eat 7 little cookies than 1 big cookie, so these are a winner with me!

This recipes wasn't that bad. I didn't have any applesauce  so I just left it out and my cookies turned out kind of cakey because of it. They tasted really good though. I will definitely use this recipes again and use applesauce next time! :)

I love chewy cookies! These were really really great and I didn't have to feel guilty eating them! I will be making them again. I tried wheat flour instead of regular and it turned out nicely. :o)

These are delicious!  Not only are these vegan, they're pretty darn healthy too!  I did not have applesauce, so I substituted mashed bananas.  I also doubled the raisins and left the nuts out.  Great breakfast cookie or mid-day treat!

I really enjoy this easy-to-make recipe, and have made it several times in the past. They are strange and texture--not like that of a high-fat oatmeal cookie, but still delicious. They are moist and cake-like, and not chewy like most low-fat cookies tend to be. I highly recommend not leaving out the walnuts or raisins, they make all the difference in texture and sweetness. I like to use dried cranberries in place of the raisins. I'll be making these over and over again and again!

These were OK for a low-fat cookie. I doubled the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp vanilla, and used golden raisins. I thought they lacked sweetness, and the texture was a little funky (the insides were soft and chewy but the outer edges were rubbery). In any case, my mom liked them! Also, I did not use the nuts, as they contain fat.

i thought these were really good for no butter or eggs, I added sunflower seeds and flax seeds as that was all i had, instead of raisins and walnuts, used all brown sugar, no white sugar.... really good, and way healthier!! will flatten more next time for more crunch, but were still good chewy :)

Great!  Thanks so much for this one.  We used unsweetened applesauce and opted out of the raisins and walnut.  These were the perfect sweetness level for us.  These are also a great treat for the little ones.

My husband -- who strictly watches his cholesterol -- LOVED these cookies. My modifications: 1/2 cup brown sugar (no white); 1/2 cup each all-purpose & whole wheat flour; 1 tsp cinnamon; 1/2 tsp nutmeg; 1/2 cup walnuts; 1/2 cup dark chocolate morsels. I also shaped and flattened the cookies before baking.

I personally found the flavor to be good, but the texture to be more muffintop-y than cookie. I agree with another reviewer that these would be better baked as bars. My 3-yr-old assistant baker took one nibble and wasn't a fan.

But again ... my husband loved them! Thanks for the recipe. (It's hard to find butter- and egg-free cookie recipes for people watching their cholesterol.)

LOVE these. I was craving oatmeal cookies one night and didnt have any eggs and wanted something healthy, and these were great! I made my own applesauce and added some dark chocolate chunks, and they turned out soo good, even my husband who is in love with junk food said they were good!! Bravo!!

This was not a cookie... Came out more like a rubbery bread... I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that their's could bounce.  I wont be making these again.  I guess I'll just stop trying to get around it and eat less cookies Lol.

I like the tatse but im not crazy about the consistency. They seemed rubbery. I tried cooking them a little longer to see if i could make them into more of a cruncy cookie but these just wont get to that point. I added cranberries to the recipe. Still a good healthy cookie option

What an incredibly healthy cookie!  The only change I made was to use whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose.  Thanks, LLUCY, for a great recipe.

This cookie was just what I was looking for!  They were soft, fluffy, and chewy!  I thought they were even better the next day.  I added chocolate chips instead of raisins and I also added about 1/4 cup of coconut, it was so good!  Greasing the cookie sheet helps so much, they just slide right off.  Also I did have to bake them for about 15-17 mins and I took another's advice and flattened them a tiny bit before putting them in the oven.  Great cookie overall!

I did make some changes to it, used 1/2 cup chopped pitted dates instead of raisins. Added one egg so it is no longer eggless :-). Used 1/3 cup brown sugar and ommitted white sugar. Used whoke spelt flour instead of all purpose flour. They turned out moist and the taste of dates in them contributes to the sweetness but they were not too sweet as I had reduced the sugar. Weight watchers, this cookie is 1 point each both before my changes and after!!

First word that comes to my head is....weird. The texture was odd, taste was alright. I added about double the cinamon and the same amt. of nutmeg and chocolate chips in place of raisins. Not bad, but not awesome either.

I rated this recipe as a four. As I put these cookies in the oven, I kept in mind that these are extremely low fat cookies so of course they aren't going to be as yummy as a full fat cookie. I followed the recipe as is, except omitted the walnuts and added two spoonfuls of peanut butter and a half cup of chocolate chips. It's true that these cookies don't flatten out in the oven, but I didn't mind because they came out thick and chewy, as I typically prefer. I did have to bake them for about 12 minutes. Overall, for a low fat cookie, I thought they were quite good but could see how they'd be bland without the peanut butter and chocolate chips. I'd definitely make these again - thanks for submitting this recipe! :)

They were good and healthy. A little too sweet though; maybe cut down on the sugar or raisins next time. Also, it was kind of rubbery... but they were very low in calories, which I liked =)

Fabulous!!! These cookies are so delicious, thick and moist and very chewy. I've gotten nothing but glowing compliments about these ones. I happened to have bought dried cranberries the day I made these, so I subbed them in for the walnuts and they taste so good, they add a nice little tang. You can also use all brown sugar instead of white and brown, that would keep it a little healthier (not that they really need to be!) I will definitely be making these again for my lunches and just regular snacking!

As far as low-fat cookies go, i adore this one. I have made it repeatedly for hiking trips and some kayaking and biking. It travels well and can be made into bars. Sometimes i switch up the applesauce for plain or banana yogurt, the sugar for splenda with some molasses, or i will kick up the spices a bit. Either way, when i leave the house, i have some of these tasty cookies with me.

These are sort of tasty, but certainly not what I'd call a cookie. They're more like a sweetish, chewy muffin top or scone.  The texture is very springy.  I bumped sugar up to 1/3 cup of brown and white sugar each and they still were not very sweet.  Also, I don't know if my oven is messed up or what, but I found the baking time for these to be waaaaay off-- they need at least 18-20 minutes.

I followed SUCCUBUS' recommendation and added two tablespoons of peanut butter to these cookies.  They smelled so great that I couldn't wait for them to cool down and burned my fingers trying to sample one!  All of the roommates have given rave reviews.  I'll make these again for sure :)

Great cookie. However, I added about 1/2 c. more oatmeal, and 1/4 c. more flour, because they're just too sticky without it. And, to make them more like my mom's recipe, I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves, and about 1/4 tsp. more of cinnamon. The cookies will not flatten out if you make them this way, so you'll have to flatten them on the cookie sheet. All in all a good low-fat recipe!

For a low fat cookie this recipe is really good! Mind you, remember LOW FAT...so its bound to not be the most amazing oatmeal cookie ever. I did just use brown sugar and 1/2 wheat flour 1/2 regular flour. I also used a mashed banana instead of the applesauce and added 1 beaten egg. These cookies really did turn out nicely well done. Note also that they don't quite look done when you take them out of the oven but they harden nicely within minutes!

I tried this with a couple adjustments.  I used 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce, so I added about 1/8 cup of white sugar.  I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Instead of raisins, I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Also, I flattened the cookies before baking them. The cookies have a different texture, a mix of cake and cookie dough.  The chocolate chips made them not seem like a "healthy cookie" and only added a little fat.  My 3-year-old loved making them and eating them!

I substitued brown suger splenda blend for baking and splenda white sugar for baking, used no sugar added applesauce, and lite salt.  Also added craisins (dried cranberries) instead of raisins.  It was a great recipe!  They are more cake-like, as others have said.  With these adaptations, I made 17 round cookies, each with just under 50 calories.  What a great guilt-free sweet treat!  I will make them again and again.

After reading all the mixed reviews I wasn't sure what to expect, but was very pleased with the results.  I used 8 oz unsweetened applesauce, splenda instead of sugar, just a smidge of honey for flavor, doubled the cinnamon, added a little nutmeg, and added about 1/4 cup eggbeaters.  Baked at 325 for about 13 minutes to compensate for the Splenda, and added raisins but no nuts.  Now I know the flavor is good, I think next time I'll leave out the eggbeaters & see how it changes the texture.  With my changes it made a very flavorful,  chewy, cake-like cookie.

Super fast to make and good tasting low fat cookie. I used pineapple applesauce and 2 tbs. of vanilla protein powder and they turned out soft and chewy. Will be making these again.

These turned out okay as written, but I think they were better when I added an egg the second time around.  I also added a handful of shredded coconut, and some semi-sweet chocolate chips.  They tasted like the chocolate chip Quaker Chewy bars!  Yum!

I love these cookies!  It is amazing how good they are without eggs or butter.  I have made them several times now and the walnuts are a must.  Also, I added about 3 Tbs. of wheat germ the last time and the consistency was improved.  They are the perfect quick and easy snack and are super delicious too!

I love this recipe and have used a variety of dried fruits in addition to raisins.  A favorite of mine is adding dried apples.  I also substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the allpurpose flour.  Turned out great!

I have to agree that these cookies are very spongy and dry.  Because my husband is a diabetic, I substituted the sugars for splenda and sugar twin brown sugar substitute, omitted the nuts and used twelve grain cereal instead of the oatmeal for extra fibre.  I doubt that adding more applesauce would make these moist.  I also found them to be too sweet, but then I have a more savory pallet.

My suggestion to anyone who found these inedible the way they are is to dry them out and crumble them into your nonfat yogurt.  At least you won't be wasting good, healthy ingredients and you'll turn that plain yogurt into a healthy nonfat, high fibre snack.

To the lady whose non stick cookie sheet burned, I suggest either your oven was set too high or your thermostat is defective.  Try using parchment paper in your pans instead of greasing them.  Nothing sticks to it and nothing will burn.

Added extra 1/4 cup extra applesauce.  Very chewy, "sproingy" almost.  Nice flavor, strange texture.  Not bad.

This was a great find!  My son had a classmate who had every food allergy under the sun (except to Gluten!) so I was happy to find a treat that he could share with EVERYONE in his class.  I did not make these with Raisins (simply because I hate baking with raisins) and opted for Mini-Chocolate chips instead. And as always, I add twice as much cinnamon as a recipe calls for.  Great base recipe!

I can't believe how good these are! I soaked the raisins in some almond milk for about an hour before making these and they turned out perfect! Nobody even knew they were low fat so don't tell!

the nutrients listed for this recipe submitted by 'Lucy' are grossly incorrect ... each cookie has exactly 78 calories (not 61 as stated), 2g of Fat; 116g Sodium; 14 carbs; 1g Fiber; 7g Sugar; 1g Protein; 32mg Calcium and 1g Iron.   i will be submitting a true low-calorie, much healthier Oatmeal Cookie @ 67 calories ea., substituting Whole Wheat Flour, Whole Grain Oats & Splenda.

if anyone who has tried to replace all the oil in a recipe with applesauce will have a clue on the texture of these cookies. When you use all applesauce it will give your cookies, bread whatever a chewy- gummy-like texture...dense also. Since i knew what to expect when i made these cookies,they are what they are. After you bake the cookies and they're cooled place in a tupperware or ziplock for and hour. The texture will improve. Simular to a cookie dough texture. Be sure to keep the bag or container opened afterward since these cookies are moist i'm sure they'll go moldy fast. I haven't tried keeping them in the fridge they don't last long. My bf likes them since they are low cal and low chloesteral and they don't hurt his diet when his sugar gets low. we both like the flavor too.

I loved them!  First and foremost I am not an excellent cook and generally when I meddle with recipes it does not work for me.  However these were so simple it was ridiculous!  I did add a touch of additional cinnamon and actually about 1/2 tsp of all spice (I love the smell alone)!  I also did 1/2 flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  Honestly, I made peanut butter oatmeal cookies last week with butter and much more sugar and I loved these so much more! :)

I cut this recipe in half for it was just for me and my husband (didn't want that many). I accidentaly added a bit too much apple sauce. Had to bake them a bit longer. They was chewy, but not he good kind of chewy. I didn't like them. I think I'm going to stick with cookies with eggs in them.

pretty great for a low fat free cookie...I also made my own apple sauce. just chopped a couple apples, popped them in the microwave with a little water and cooked them a little before blending them. (just have to let it cool a bit before adding it to the mix) I also added a splash of rape seed oil. Though the cookies didn't 'flatten out' they were moist and soft. This recipe is a keeper!

For a practically nonfat cookie, these were great! My toddler loved them, especially the dough. I made a few changes: whole wheat pastry flour in place of all purpose, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda (I read this on another review) and I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and tsp of vanilla extract. I think they would be even better with walnuts but my toddler is allergic so I omitted them. They weren't the prettiest of cookies (they look really dry) but they made up for that in taste and texture and were very moist.

don't make these expecting crispy-outside-chewy-inside cookies. these dont taste like that because they dont have copious amounts of fat. i thought they were wonderful as healthy cookie substitute - omitted raisins & nuts and added 1/2 C chocolate chips. toddler & diet approved!

These cookies came out of the oven looking a hot mess, but they were delicious!  The texture is very light and cakey; hard to believe that they are good for you.  The only changes I made were using cinnamon applesauce, 1/2 cup of wheat flour and 1/2 cup of regular, and used cranberries as well as raisins.  Really wonderful, thank you for sharing such a delicious, healthy cookie recipe!

I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and substituted cranberry, cherry, and blueberry trail mix for the raisins. Also added the walnuts. For this type of recipe, low fat & egg free, it's quite good -- lots of flavor! Just don't expect the texture to be like regular cookies.  : )

The flavor of these cookies is quite good, but the consistency is really weird and the texture is off-putting. The batch I made is still warm and edible, but I'm afraid of what will happen to them when they cool.

These are not Grandma's soft, melt-in-your-mouth chocolate chip cookies, but they're one of the healthiest ways I've found to trick that after dinner sweet craving.  I added a few chocolate chips and some Better 'n Butter peanut butter (only 2g fat- find it at Trader Joe's), which really sealed the deal.

SO great for a low-fat, egg-free recipe. I used cinnamon applesauce (only kind on hand) and that really brought out the cinnamon flavor. I have made these twice (in three days) and they have been a hit each time. For the most recent batch, I even cut back more on the sugar - 1/8 cup white and 1/6 brown. I am so happy to have found a moist, delectable, and HEALTHY alternative to breakfast breads and desserts.

Well, I didn't quite follow the recipe. I didn't have applesauce so I used very ripe banana and butter instead, and I used 2 tsp of cinnamon. When I baked them, they stayed in exactly the little balls i made them into, so I flattened them. They tasted fine, but were pretty tough and chewy. We kinda liked them - something different, but they weren't really cookies...I think they would have made great granola bars!

Great recipe, I am 8 month pregnant and craving sweets! However I also have gallstones so I can't eat much fat.  These were a life saver!  I used half whole wheat flour and all brown sugar added some diced apples to the mix. Yummy! Even my husband ate them up! Thanks!

Not what I was hoping for.  It was almost like a no-bake cookie.  Very rubbery.  I even added chocolate chips to help with the taste....did not work.  Will not make again.

I made these for my husband while he's on his low fat diet, he loves them.  Great alternative to high fat cookies.

Really wish I had read the reviews before trying these cookies.  They are a cake like (doughy) consistency.  Although the flavour is okay.

This is pretty good for a low-fat recipe.  I would recommend cooking longer than 10 minutes.  The taste is good and the cookies are soft. My husband has celiac disease and I made these gluten-free for him using gluten free flour.

I increased the applesauce to 1c, added one mashed ripe banana and baked in an 8x8 glass baking dish for 20-25 min. to make cookie bars.  They stay moist for a long time, though the consistency is not like a regular cookie bar (very cake-like).  They make a good breakfast.

For what they are, they are not bad.  My friend is on a diet so I thought I would surprise her with these.  She liked them.  I ended up putting mini chocolate chips in them.  For someone not on a diet I would go back to regular Oatmeal cookies.  For me they just were not sweet enough.  They are a cakee type of a cookie.  But you would expect that with apple sauce!

These cookies have a good flavor, But they do take a lot of chewing. I left out the salt, nuts, and raisins. They are light and fluffy,but very spongey. Worth trying, half the recipe!!!

Lucille, I think your cookies are delicious! I never liked regular cookies with butter, oil, etc. They were always too heavy & made my stomach hurt. These cookies are fluffy and light :) Wonderful! The first batch was a little bland, so I added another 1/2 tsp cinammon and skimped on the salt. Thanks Lucille!

Great easy recipe. One suggestion-the cookies need to be baked for at about 14 minutes instead of 10.

Not a bad recipe.  Especially for Low fat / fat free.  I added more applesauce to mine (1Cup)
and also some chocolate chips.  My kids ate them with no complaint.  Will make them again.

Ok so not what I expected. They are very rubbery but good flavor. I'll use this recipe again but omit the white sugar since the cookie is too sweet.

just made this recipe for my dad who was recently placed on a heart-healthy diet due to his cholesterol & high blood pressure. HE LOVED THEM! made 1 batch according to recipe which were very soft & fluffy.. kind of cake-like. made a 2nd batch w/ a few changes 1)mashed banana w/ water instead of applesauce 2) baking soda instead of baking powder 3) chocolate chips in place of nuts/raisins... tasted like banana bread & made soft & chewy cookies. very delicious, will be making again and again! thanx 4 the recipe!!

These were just what they claim to be.  A very moist, almost cake-like, oatmeal raisin applesauce cookie.  They don't really compare to a traditional oatmeal raisin. I was looking for a vegan alternative, and I opted instead to use my traditional recipe, and substitute flax for the egg, and earth balance for the butter.  This was a pretty good recipe, just not exactly what I was looking for.  My milk allergy child enjoys them, so we may make them again. :)  Thanks for sharing!

I am sorry to say these tasted pretty aweful.  Rubbery, uncooked texture.  I had to cook them longer as the inside was still uncooked but it didn't help much.

I was really disappointed by these cookies.  I followed the recipe closely - added a bit extra cinnamon on the advice of another reviewer.  The dough smelled wonderful and they certain smelled good while they were in the oven but they didn't really bake through.  The cookies were very doughy, and chewy.  I think I'll go back to my regular recipe and just cut back on the sugar - these were a huge disappointment!

I have just made these cookies and whilst I accept that they are low fat, they are somewhat bland and have a rather odd texture and are certainly not moist.  I will make them again but will add extra apple sauce to moisten them up a tad, maybe play around with some other fruits and add more cinnamon as they really do need perking up. I am also tempted to substitute some of the sugar, particularly the white sugar which is not healthy, with honey. I think this will make them more healthy and more chewy. I think with some tinkering they will be great.

The cookies were quite good.  I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, and mini chocolate chips for the walnuts.  I found I had to cook them about 12-14 minutes.  I knew they would be chewy and enjoyed them.  Some of my co-workers enjoyed them as well.

Great moist cookie... Almost tastes like a muffin. Excellent! We used chocolate chips instead of nuts (defeated the fat-free theme, but oh well!) but I think this recipe would definitely do well with banana and nuts. Or even blueberries or cranberries. Also, I baked these on parchment paper and they came out moist and soft after 10 minutes in the oven. Thanks for this recipe!!

For a cookie with no egg/shortening/oil/butter, they are fantastic. I may even try to cut down more on the sugar next time to make them even healthier. 

I used soda instead of baking powder like other reviewers suggested and used a few chocolate chips instead of raisins/walnuts. 

They are more of a muffin like consistency and are very moist to the point of stickiness the next day, but the taste is still great.

And they are also super super fast to make!

For an egg-free, low-fat cookie, these were pretty good, but they didn't have the oatmeal cookie feel that I was looking for (which I'm assuming is because of the lack of butter). I made a total of three adjustments to this recipe. 1) I didn't have enough applesauce so I pureed half an apple to make up the difference 2) I added chocolate chips and 3) I added some peanut butter. Maybe with a little more tweaking this recipe will be perfect for my tastes!

These cookies were not to my liking, unless you are trying  to eat oatmeal a different way. They we rubbery and like another post said they can actually bounce.  I was disappointed because I have used applesauce vs oil in cakes before and they were great. I was really hoping to find a good low-fat alternative.

Well...more like a muffin top (like a Vita-muffin) than a cookie.  I used cranberries which was nice, added flax, half cup whole wheat flour, nutmeg, and cloves.  Not bad as a mid-morning snack to take to work but not a real cookie treat.  On another note, my husband couldn't stop eating them...go figure.

Pretty good, I think it still needs some tweaking, as the cookies are a little heavier than a traditional oatmeal cookie, but the flavor is great... and you can't beat the fact that it's made sans butter. All in all I would recommend for someone trying to find a healthier cookie.

Great flavor but the texture was a little too strange to get over.  I also used half apple sauce and half apple butter.  For a fat free treat it's not bad.  I added m&m's to half the batch for my 5 year old.

I thought these were great! I took someone else's advice and used baking soda instead of powder. My husband said they tasted more like muffins than cookies. But we both loved them. I added some flax seed to mine and I think next time I will use some whole wheat flour. Really good,quick, and healthy. Thanks for the recipe.

Not great. I substituted chocolate chips for raisins.  It was a weird texture- not very "cookie-like".

Didn't cook right, browned on bottom and not top. Consistancy was more like a scone than a cookie.

Great for what they are.  I baked them 9 minutes and smashed them down with a fork (like a PB cookie), and they came out great. Low cal treats = less guilt!  Remember... no matter what they try to sell you ... THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DIET COOKIE!

These cookies have good flavor, but they are a little chewy. Plus, the dough was sticky and the baked cookies stuck to the tray. Instead of raisins I used craisins.

Erika Angel, if you do not know the answer, it is not a stupid question.  A cup is 8 ounces or 16 tablespoons, or 48 teaspoons.  There are standard measuring containers for 1 cup, 3/4 cup, 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup and 1/4 cup to help you measure the amount you need.

for a low fat cookie these aren't bad. i thought they were a little bland, even though i added a whole tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 a tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. next time i make these i'll probably double the cinnamon (& nutmeg) and try adding some butter extract with the vanilla and i'll probably choose a different dried fruit for them since i didnt care too much for the raisins. overall though they were good!

It turned out wonderful for me. It had a great apple smell and taste, it was soft, perhaps a little too soft, cake-like and not the chewy cookie texture.  I did use 2 apples that were microwaved until soft and then beat w/ blender. I also noticed that the thin applesauce made the little amounts of sugar overwhelming, so I would use 1/3c sugar next time. Overall it was tasty and good to know it wouldn't hurt me too much for a snack!

This is a delicious cookie. Here are the substitutions I used to make chocolate chip cookies. 1 Cup Xylitol 2 T. molasses (to replace the brown sugar) 1 Cup W.W. Pastry flour 1 t. baking powder 1/2 t. celtic sea salt 1 Cup rolled oats 1 cup vegan, organic chocolate chips  i don't like cinnamon. I like walnuts but my Son's allergic to them.

I was excited to try this recipe because of all the reviews and all variations that you can make this cookie. (and I also had no eggs). I made the regular recipe first that tasted really bad. Then I added peanut butter a little better but still bad. then I added apples still bad then I added chocolate chips and YES! still bad. This Recipe is a Waste! I would suggest strongly that you pass this recipe by. And Yes, I will never make this again. If only I had a dog or a pig I could give the ones I made to.   :(

Awesome recepie! Because it uses almost no fat, it was completely unexpected! I used half whole wheat and half white flour and added nutmeg which really added to the recipe. I highly recommend these! p.s. even my guy friends liked them

VERY good for healthy cookies! I just made a couple changes: (1) I did a little over 1/2 cup of white flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour to make them a little thicker and (2) I added more cinnamon, along with some nutmeg and cloves to give them some extra flavor!

These were so simple and what you would expect for a fat free cookie. If you are used to the consistency of butter/egg less cookies, these are pretty good.

surprisingly very good for a healthy cookie. I put dried cranberries instead of raisins and they turned out so moist and chewy. I will probably be making this again with other variations. I'm very impressed.

I'd give 3.5 stars if it were possible. They are definitely different consistency-wise, but are a great alternative for a treat rather than no-good-goodies! Next time, I would up the cinnamon a bit. The raisins add sweetness, but I like to taste the spice a bit more. They are good cookies, but not for you if you want something that tastes like what you are used to!

These are a great alternative to high fat/calorie cookies. I used a mashed ripe banana instead of applesauce and half white flour/half whole wheat flour. My cookies turned out really well. I think I'm going to try adding a mixture of dried fruits next time. Yum!

These tasted good, but turned out as balls of flour and applesauce! They didn't rise or anything, and came out of the oven in the same shape they went in, without spreading or anything. I guess the recipe is just too healthy to work.

Great recipe. Due to my diabetes, I substituted the white sugar for Splenda, used all natural applesauce, and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. My office loved them and asked me to share the recipe. I did have to flatten the cookies before baking, as they do not spread. Thanks for sharing!

This is great for a fat free cookie.  I used cinnamon flavored applesauce and increased to one cup. I also added 1 Tbsp of maple syrup.  Not super sweet, but nice for a snack.  Consistancy is chewy, but not spongy. All in all a good recipe

I used 1 cup applesauce, 1 tsp. cinnamon and added 1 tsp. vanilla and a large handful of chocolate chips.  I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins (didn't have any).  They are definitely "fat-free" tasting, but the addition of the chocolate chips made them acceptable. I prefer a cookie that gets crisp on the edges and soft inside- but these don't.  They have a spongy texture. Good for dieters!

I'm on a new low-fat diet and homemade cookies are my biggest weakness, so I've been looking for some good low-fat recipes.  I really wanted to like these, but after eating just one, I don't think I can eat any more of them.  Hopefully, my little grandsons won't know the difference and eat them for me.  I read all the reviews and knew they would have a different texture than regular cookies.  They're probably fine for what they are meant to be, but they are too rubbery for me.  I added extra cinnamon and a little vanilla and nutmeg, and left out the nuts.  They were not very sweet-tasting and rather bland.

These are very easy to make and have a wonderful flavor.  Especially good for those who just can't eat one of anything.

Great cookie for our no egg/dairy/soy/wheat diet.  I even left out the raisins and walnuts and changed the all-purpose flour to oat flour (added 1/4 cup extra) and it turns out great.  Nice moist cookie.  I wouldn't say gooey, just nice and moist, cake-like.  We love em!

These cookies were very easy to make but tasted very gooey and floury compared to your average oatmeal raisin cookie. I have to admit, for a healthy treat they're not so bad.

These were really easy to make, but quite gooey.  The taste was awful!!  My son didn't mind them because he still saw them as cookies, but my husband who is on a very low fat diet, thought they were gross, but ate them anyways.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, so I'm not sure if some people that reviewed just don't have taste buds, or if something went wrong somewhere!!

I just have to say.. i can't believe everyone on here did not say anything about the nuts!!!
 HELLO NUTS ARE VERY HIGH IN FAT!!!
You need to state that in your recipe that adding them will not make the cookies low-fat.
Their are some people that look at nuts as being a health food..yet they do not know they are very high in fat!

This is a great recipe!  I added a little bit of crushed pineapple and golden raisins and left out the nuts!  I had to cook them a little longer.  A great, moist, and tasty cookie!  I will be making this one again.

My health-freak roommates and I were pretty excited about this recipe.  We didn't have any nuts or raisins so we added low-sugar raspberry jam to the cookies by removing the cookies from the oven after about 7 minutes, making little indentations, spooning the jam on, and baking for another five minutes.  They tasted great!

Pretty good for egg free cookies.  They are sort of gooey and gump looking but other than that they are easy to nibble away.  Thanks for the recipe.

The finished cookies are rather dry.  My son only likes the raisins in it. I will try again with 1/4-1/2 cup more apple sauce. This cookie will not flatten or expand much like more other cookies too, so slightly flatten dough before baking.

They were very good I added 1/4cup or 1/2 a cup of Lowfat I can't believe it's not butter. To make them a little more moist. And used oatmeal flour and a little bit of coconut flour. And chocolate chips. Barely have raisins. They were delicious. Also cooked them for 15 minutes. Not to sweet. Also used raw sugar instead of brown sugar. I have no walnuts.

Not a great low calorie cookie. These looked ok, but came out with a bizarre texture. They were very rubbery/bouncy and chewy, with no crispness at all. They took me about 20 minutes in the oven to even just start to brown the bottoms, which was odd. The applesauce flavor was so overpowering it tasted more like apples than an oatmeal cookie. There are way better healthier cookies out there— don’t waste your time with this one.

Pretty good cookies—much better than I expected with no butter or eggs!  I added a capful of vanilla, and baked for 14 minutes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Mine made 30 cookies.  We’re on a diet to increase our metabolism, but cheated a bit on this as we have been missing sugar.  Thanks!

I really like this recipe and it's quite versatile as well. I played with some of the options like others did. In my case, I replaced some of the apple sauce with peanut butter and I used chocolate chips. If you need more liquid, add an egg white. It's a really great healthy snack!

I made these a couple days ago & we loved them. I've cut out sweets/sugar as much as possible so when I found this recipe I knew that it would be good and it was off the charts good! I just mad them again  tweaking it a little. I substituted raw sugar instead of white also used 3/4 cup & 2 tbls applesauce a bit more raisins.  Awesome

These are pretty decent. I added 2 tablespoons more applesauce and added 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips. These are sweet, flavorful, and moist. And at about 65 calories a piece, these make wonderful healthy snacks!

The reason I give 4 stars only is because I'm not too fond of applesauce. I was hoping the taste would be less once baked, which it is. But I can still taste the applesauce (makes sense consider these are made with it!).

So pretty good cookie, great cookie texture, not gooey but not dry. I would recommend.

I made some changes to this recipe and loved it.  Instead of applesauce, I used 1 tbsp of milled flax and 1/4 cup of water, together with 2 tbsp of peanut butter and 1 mashed banana.  I blended the flax and water until smooth and creamy (this takes the place of an egg) and then added the peanut butter and banana.  I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar (omitted the white sugar) and then 2 tablespoons or so of coconut oil, then blended the whole thing together.  I poured this into the dry mix and stirred just until combined.  In the dry mix, I used 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp of baking soda, as others suggested, and replaced half of the flour with whole wheat.  Finally, I added some nutmeg and extra cinnamon.  I omitted the walnuts and used dark chocolate instead.  They are light and fluffy, but definitely not "bouncy" as others have said.  It kind of ended up being a different recipe entirely, but this was a great base for ideas and they are fantastic!

Super, Crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I used a mashed banana instead of the apple, divided the mixture into 3  and put a tablespoon of orange marmalade in one third, a tablespoon of peanut butter in another  and left the third. Increased the calories but not by much.  Rolled the mixture out and cut with the small biscuit cutter.  Tillyflop.

This was good! I only gave it 4 stars since I still made some modifications. I have not tried the original recipe so I am not sure how that tastes. I'm on a low fat diet, so I made some changes that are good for me!(Except for the chocolate. Got to have that!)

I replace the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour.

For the sugars, I sub: 
1/3 cup light brown sugar
1/6 cup white sugar
 
I add:

I love healthy baking, but I had to throw these away. :( They tasted like undercooked, chewy, too-sweet muffins (even after baking them for 6 minutes longer). My advice is to stick to muffin recipes if you are going low-fat/vegan/egg-free.

Very bland and too dense and chewy for my liking. Perhaps with a little variance these could be a lot better, but as-is they were very lacking and not worth keeping.

I made these last night and was not very happy with the outcome. I got my mom to try one and she said they were ok (I think she was afraid to hurt my feelings because I saw her later give it to the dog) I tossed the rest of the batch..not very good at all:(

For a low-fat cookie, these are great! I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, instead of the white. And, I didn't have baking powder, so I used baking soda. Also, I added shredded coconut to half the batch instead of raisins. They don't have the texture of a traditional cookie, more like a muffin. But very good either way! Everybody loved them! I'll be making these again, and again! Thank you! =]

Just found the recipe about an hour ago and just finished baking them. Personally I really like them! The texture is a bit tougher and drier than a cookie made with butter and eggs, but still very good. I added a bit more cinnamon and a tbsp. of nutmeg for spice. I'm not familiar with the drop a teaspoon method so some may have turned out a lot bigger, oh well. I recommend this recipe.

I made these alleged cookies and decided to tell people that they were really more like baked oatmeal blobs. They were not sweet enough nor crunchy enough, in my opinion, to be called cookies, but taste good enough for an egg free low fat option. If you want cookies you may as well use 1/2 the butter a regular cookie recipe calls for and sub. applesauce for the other 1/2 because the texture and flavor lost are not worth the calories saved.

Really good once you spice them up with a bit of allspice, cinnamon, and vanilla.  And fun to play with too since they're almost rubber.

Ugh. No question that you're eating something low fat. If you're desperate for something sweet, it'll do in a pinch, but they're so rubbery you can almost fold them. Sorry.... maybe I did something wrong.

These didn't taste exactly like cookies, but they were very good and actually very sugary, even though I substituted sweet 'n low for the white sugar.

Exactly what i was looking for. As a college student without much in the pantry, these were sooo easy and a great, guilt-free snack while working on finals. I shared them with people on my floor and everybody raved about them. Nobody could tell that they didn't have butter, oil or egg. Also, I chopped up some apple and threw that in as well to give it more apple flavor...I did this also because i only had 1/2 a cup of applesauce, but i think it really added!

My housemate and I made these tonight, and we agreed that our review really depends on what our expectations were going in...mine were for a lowfat cookie, so I wasn't too disappointed (minus the rubbery texture maybe), whereas my housemate was expecting a cookie more akin to the real deal. Not sure if we'd make again...I think an egg or egg substitute might be better than the applesauce.

A really great low fat cookie!  Super easy to make.  Mine cooked just perfectly at 12 minutes.  Just know that because of the low fat/sugar content, these are much more cake-like than cookie.  Will make again and again.

These cookies taste good, my husband really loves oatmeal raisin cookies, and we appreciate the low fat version.  I followed the recipe exactly (without nuts) but I had to bake them 10-15 minutes longer than called for, otherwise they were still mush.  Besides that, great recipe!

These were soft and really good considering they are low fat. As other reviewer said, they don't expand. So i pushed them down to the size of a normal cookie. You have to make them really small to get 24 cookies. I used rainsins and also added a bit of orange zest. I love eating these with a glass of milk and I won't feel guilty eating them!

This is my first time baking with apple sauce. Which I have been dying to try. I would say these are pretty darn good for being "diet" type cookies. They aren't as good as good old fashioned oatmeal raisin cookies. But hey, when you are dieting and want cookies these fit the bill pretty good. They are also good when you are out of margaine and want to bake cookies! Thanks!

I have made these before.  They are a good healthy cookie that I don't feel bad giving my kids.  But they don't expand, and they don't brown much either.  I have been asked if I baked them and you can tell they don't have sugar.  On the other hand they are really moist.

Great low fat recipe.  We enjoyed the flavor, but the texture is very akward for a cookie. We used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Like the other reviewer said....some cookie is better than no cookie at all.

These are nice and chewy, even days later. The perfect size for nibbles. All I changed was the amount of cinnamon: I doubled it to suit my tastes. All in all a perfect combination of texture and flavour.

I made these cookies with a few modifications to the recipe- I added an egg as well as some chocolate chips (rather than the raisins, as I didn't have them).

I can't imagine what they'd taste like with out the egg, because even with the egg they were still quite tough and dense.

If you are on a diet, this recipe is fine.  (Any cookie is better than no cookie!!) They were a bit tough day after, but I microwaved them for 10 secs and they were fine.

These cookies were about what you'd expect from an egg free cookie. Our family didn't care for the texture, and they didn't have much flavor. They weren't awful, but we probably won't make them again.

I really liked the cookies. One has to used to "diet" type cookies before liking though. I put in a cup of applesauce, and a ton of cinnamon. I also used chopped dried apricots and splenda instead of the white sugar. Good recipe for us allergic to eggs!!!

These cookies are amazing! I was looking for a good chewy oatmeal cookie recipe, and I substituted the raisins and nuts for chocolate chips, and theyre perfect! Be careful not to put too much flour in them, as it seems like they need it, but they really dont.

An excellent choice for my son who is allergic to everything....however a little "doughy" for my taste.  We added dried cranberries to it for a bit more sweetness...and a little extra sugar.

Not a bad recipe, especially considering that it's quite healthy!  The result I got was a chewy and spongey cookie that tasted quite a bit like the snack bars you'd find in the health food aisle.  Next time, I'd probably try adding a little more cinnamon and adding the walnuts, which I chose to omit.

these cookies turned out great!  i increased the applesauce to one cup, increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp, added 1tsp of vanilla, and substituted toasted almonds for the walnuts.  don't leave the raisins out - they bring all the ingredients together.

These were pretty tasty for a low-fat cookie. The spongy texture didn't bother me, and I liked the flavor of the applesauce. I would've preferred them a little sweeter, though. I used half whole wheat flour which may have affected my results. All in all, pretty yummy!

I am sorry but these cookies were horrible. They did not flatten, they had a "rubbery" texture.   I needed an eggless, milkless, butterless recipe for an allergic child. At first glance the ingredients were perfect for what I needed. However the taste was terrible. I am sure I can easily find something much better. I will look for a recipe that calls for butter and safely use a vegetable shortening substitute instead.  I hope that there will be improvements made to this recipe for others who dare to make it.

I tried to love this cookie...but I suppose I am used to the more fattening ones. I love using applesauce in my cookies, but I think I need the egg as well :( No offense Lucille. I am sure my boys will love them. They have not been corrupted by the classic oatmeal cookie.
