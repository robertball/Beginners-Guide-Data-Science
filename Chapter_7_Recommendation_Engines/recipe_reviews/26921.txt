RECIPE UPDATE

I'm the author of this recipe and I wanted to make a few updates.  I now use cumin instead of the black pepper.  You want 2 cloves of garlic overall.  To adjust the texture between creamy and more solid (which is very good also) vary the amount of liquid you drain from the can.  The more liquid the creamier, but lately I've been draining all of the can except for 1/2 cup.  I now use 3 large tablespoons of Tahini instead of 2.  I also take the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon and add it gradually as the blending occurs.  Peanut Butter is no substitute for Tahini!  If you're using peanut butter, you're not eating real hummus.  Find it at an international food store

This is a pretty good starting point for hummus.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five because of the name of the recipe.  Not to be rude or anything, but because it's misleading.  Hummus is a dish that has so many regional variations.  And to try and decide which region's is more authentic is a biblical and political debate that I won't touch.  BUT- This is pretty good.  It may be a bit salty, but for some that's the way it's supposed to be!  I say this as a woman with a Turkish mom, who was married to a Greek man (I know...) and who's been to the Middle East.  It's like trying to post a BBQ recipe and calling it "Real BBQ".  As is, it's good enough for those that just like hummus, but if you are looking for a particular style you may have to tinker with it.

This is a delicious recipe.  I added a Tbsp of honey and used the whole lemon.  I also toasted and ground whole cumin seeds for a super fresh flavour.  Adjust salt to taste.  I used only 1 Tbsp of olive oil for fat reduction, but I used extra virgin, so it still gave lots of flavour.  Tips: 1 - some canned chick peas are slightly undercooked (crunchy) and should be boiled for 20 minutes or more before using (if you like a smooth texture). 2 - tahini goes rancid easily so buy it in a jar (not bulk) and keep it in the fridge.  3 - for easier digestion, discard the liquid in the can of chickpeas, rinse them, and use water for blending.

Really good.  To make it better, use chickpeas that you've cooked at home.  I use 2 cloves of garlic.  By the way, this is the classic "five-point" recipe for hummus.  Chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice, tahini, and olive oil.  Anything else is a variation thereof.

A wonderful recipe! So easy! I make this about once a week. I use 2 15oz cans of beans, therefore I use about 4 heaping tbls of tahini, juice of 2 lemons (meyer lemons are so tasty in this); otherise I followed everything else as stated(the updated version). Sometimes I take the time to peel off the skins on the garbanzo beans...it does make a creamier texture but is really not that necessary...it tastes fantastic either which way...thanks for sharing!!UPDATE: I use one can garbonzos and one can black beans (rinsed and drained). With this I use only lime juice, otherwise all the same. AWSOME!! I never ever put olive oil on top....it's too perfect to dizzle oil on.

Home-made hummus is the only way to go! I suggest adding the lemon gradually, to taste, because I used the full amount the first time and it was too lemony for me. I also added more garlic and didn't add the oil or salt since there's already so much sodium in the canned chick peas. Sometimes I add some marinated artichoke hearts to mix for some extra kick. And tahini is a must; peanut butter is no substitute.

Sounds good but to really make it 'from scratch' make your own tahini!  Bob's Red Mill brand of White Sesame Seeds has recipes for both the tahini (made from the sesame seeds) and hummus on the package.  Tahini is simply toasted white sesame seeds ground in a food processor with some olive oil. His recipe uses a 16 oz. bag of white sesame seeds and 3/4 cup olive oil.  Toast the seeds in a single layer on a baking sheet in a 350 oven for about 10 minutes stirring a couple of times to prevent edges from becoming too brown.  Remove from oven and let them cool for at least 20 minutes.  Then pour sesame seeds into a food processor, turn it on and drizzle the olive oil into the seeds, processing until creamy (about 1-2 minutes).  Makes about 2 cups and can be stored in the refrigerator for about a week.  Enjoy!

I can't believe I had been spending big bucks for hummus! This is fast, easy, inexpensive and GOOD! My whole family, including my thirteen year old, loves it. I didn't have any tahini in the house so I substituted a little peanut butter and some ground sesame seeds to get the nutty flavor. I also added black olives to rave reviews. A definite keeper!

Very good basic Hummus recipe!   I went with the updated version the author added.    The only difference I made was similar to others; cooked the garlic before adding it.    Raw garlic can be over powering.  But roasting takes too long for me when I get a Hummus craving!  Instead I put the garlic through a press and added it to about 2-3 tablespoons of water and simmered it on the stove in a small sauce pan for about 5 minutes.   It takes the edge off.  Then I added all of it, garlic and water to the Hummus in the blender.    So good and yummy!!

Mine was a 15 ounce can of garbanzo beans, so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly, including "to taste."  We found we liked it as is, and also with about 1/2 tsp. of cumin.  This of course would have been excellent with pita chips, but in an effort to come up with something a little healthier I topped 1/4" inch cucumber rounds with it, then with a dab of Greek yogurt and toasted sesame seeds.  Delicious, guilt-free and attractive hummus appetizer!

I made this according to the author's update of Oct 2008. I wasn't sure how much 1 can of beans would make but it was a gracious plenty for my family of 4. I used the 2 cloves of garlic and it was plenty garlicy. I drained and rinsed the beans to make them more digestable and added just enough water as needed to my food processor as it was running until the beans spun freely - it was probably not more than a quarter cup and I put the two TBSP Olive oil in while it was spinning also. I added in a little dried Oregano and topped it with some dried parsley for a colorful presentation. I served it with some fresh carrot and celery sticks and pita pretzels. I will use this as my basic recipe for sure. Delicious!

My husband is from the Middle East and over the 25 yrs of our marriage I have eaten hummus from many Middle Eastern cooks. I make my own from canned garbanzo beans, too. Authentic Middle Eastern hummus has to be made with tahini, not peanut butter. This is an excellent base recipe. Add the ingredients and taste as you go so you can get it just the way you want it. I would suggest using 3 tablespoons of tahini because it will improve the taste and give the hummus a creamier texture.

Next time only half the salt. Great smooth texture. Added an extra clove of garlic and cumin as the original recipe writer suggested in the reviews. I only added about a 1/4 cup of reserved liquid and might reduce it a bit more. Also added a few dashes of hot sauce and sprinkled with paprika and a dusting of ground dried chipotles when serving. Good recipe, just needs less salt.

Brought this to a party with all different types of people attending.. was worried it might be too "exotic" but it was a huge success. People with very conservative taste buds asked me first.. what is it?.. then.. it is hard to make?...and finally... can I have the recipe? I had doubled the recipe and brought my empty dish home.. Thanks!

Both taste- & expensewise, this is a far better choice than store-bought hummus.  As suggested, I used only 1/2 tsp salt, as well as added (to taste) some spices I had lying about (in this case, lemon pepper, nutmeg, ginger, coriander, and cumin).  We don't have a blender, so I mashed the garbanzos and garlic together with a potato masher, poured in the liquid, and used an electric mixer (I added the garbanzo juice as I mixed until it looked/felt right).  The result was a bit chunky, but not in a bad way.  I feel like I might be one of only a few who hasn't got a blender, but if you don't, this can be amazing made without one.

Excellent recipe!  Simple, straightforward; delicious as written, but also a useful base recipe to get creative with.  Update, 15-ish years later: this is still my go-to and the recipe I send to everyone who is foolish enough to buy hummus pre-made. The trick of saving the can juice makes it so much less oily. I've used it straight, with half-black beans, half-olive, and mixed all sorts of things in.  You can't go wrong.

This was a fairly basic, rather bland hummus, as far as they go. I make hummus for my husband, as I don't generally eat it (it's ok, just not really my thing), & today he happened to be home when I was making it, so he got a fresh taste of it. He felt the lemon juice was too strong, so I added a pinch of Splenda. He also agreed it was a touch bland, so I took the submitter's suggestion of adding cumin (1/2 tsp.) & my husband's suggestion of red pepper flakes (1/2 tsp., but I don't suggest anyone else add that much, ouch!). Flavor additions aside, the reason I'm not handing out a 5 star for this one is because making this recipe in a blender is just asking for trouble. I tried it, & what wound up happening is all the liquid settled to the bottom & the thick beans settled to the top & quit being stirred in! It would be quite easy to overheat your blender if you didn't notice this in time, too. The solution is either A: use a food processor; B: use a potato masher; or C: add more liquid, which will change the texture, but save your blender. Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE: I switched the amounts of tahini/lemon & the taste was great. Added about 1/2 cup of bean water from the can too (aquafaba). Texture was perfect. I still won't make it in a blender tho.

A good basic hummus recipe.  My Syrian girlfriend makes the world's best hummus, but she just 'eyeballs' her ingredients.  This recipe gave me a good starting point to go from.  Check the author's update in the comments section - per his suggestions I cut the salt in half.  I also added an extra clove of garlic and I upped my tahini to 4 TBS (personal taste preference).  
My girlfriend always dumps A LOT of olive oil on her hummus - I don't put on as much as she does, but it really does enhance the flavor.

This is my recipe and when I made it again I found that it does have too much salt and that I needed to add olive oil and water to the mixture in the food processor, I made a small batch of it.

Good! This has all the right ingredients, I just had to play with the amounts. I ended up using 1/4 cup lemon and 4 tbs. (1/4 cup) tahini. And HALF the salt was PLENTY. 1-2 tsp. of olive oil IN the mixture added to the taste too. I am certain that a nearby Lebanese shop adds 1-2 Tbs. of plain yogurt. I added it cautiously, and it really improved the smooth texture and flavor. But to each his own :)

These was wonderful!  Just keep all ingredients on counter until complete so that you can to suit your taste.  I added extra tahini, andother time just extra lemon juice, another time I added cumin.  All was good with pita chips and as a spread in tortilla roll ups.

This is an excellent recipe for this dish.  I found that using a blender was a bit aggravating, as it's quite thick.  A food processor might work better, but I don't have one.  Also, I omitted the olive oil drizzle because, frankly, I tasted it before adding it and it was wonderful, so why waste the calories???  I've made this recipe twice, and I'll tell ya, don't buy the cheap chick peas!  It's only $.40 more a can and it's worth it!

I make this hummus quite often. I often add roasted red peppers also. My biggest suggestion is to place the garbanzo beans in a shallow bowl of water and take the skins off the beans. Just rub them with your fingers and they slip off quite easily.  It's a little time consuming but makes for a MUCH creamier hummus.

Very good base recipe.  Only giving 4 stars since I didnt think there was enough garlic and the amount of tahini needs to be upped.  I made 2 seperate batches, the first was as written and the second was with about 6 cloves of roasted garlic and about 1/4 cup tahini.  I also added about 1/4 tsp ground cumin and more like 5 tbsp lemon juice.  Let it chill in fridge over night and its amazing!

This is awesome hummus!! I love making things myself, so I'm really happy to have found such a delicious recipe. Everyone said it was the best hummus they ever had. I didn't use the original recipe, I used the one with the suggested changes, and it was awesome! Thanks!

This was pretty fantastic.  I dislike store bought hummus because of it's weird consistency, and this is so easy to make (and less expensive!) that I'll never buy hummus again!  I've made it twice and I preferred the taste with fresh lemon juice.  I also used both a dash of cumin and fresh ground black pepper.  Thanks!

I really like this Hummus but have made some changes to fit my needs.
1. I love spicy things so I added about a 1 tsp of Sriracha chili sauce 
2. I'm also am addicted to garlic so I used 3 cloves and 3 shakes of Lawrys garlic salt.
3. I seasoned it with paprika, ground turmeric root, and homemade basil olive oil. 
DELICIOUS :)

I love it! I have made it twice. I bought some classic organic hummus at traders joys just to compare to this one. And I like this one better! However when I gave the hummus to my friends (on the same plates so they would not know whats the difference) and asked them which one they liked better, most people said store bought was better but they are both good... I personally liked the taste  of this one better. More garlicy less sour... thanks for the recipe! Now I will always make my own, just adjust to my taste...

I thought I had misread the lemon juice ingredient, as the first taste was so sour and lemony, it was inedible.  I added more of the garbanzo beans and tahini, and eventually, it tasted just fine, but I agree with the reviewer who suggested just adding a little lemon juice at a time, and stopping when it reaches the level you like.  I would think that would be at about HALF the recommended amount.  One other change that I made was to use fresh-roasted garlic and about 2x what the recipe called for.    The final result was five stars, but if I had never had hummus and never known what to expect, and how to fix it, I would have assumed that hummus is disgusting and would never have tried it again.

You can also use black beans instead.  It comes out a beautiful purple color.  We had this in a fav. restaurant and found this recipe works with the black beans!

I just tried this today following everything listed (except I went half tsp of salt and added cumin), used my blender and it barely got through blending all of it...as a result, it all came out chunky and thick. The taste was far too sour with the lemon juice and I think adding ANY salt is a bad idea because it came out very salty...not a fan :(

Cooked my own chick peas from dried- be aware that 16 oz of dried is equal to about 2 cans so you need to double the amount of everything. Used about 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Also roasted a whole bulb of garlic plus a red bell pepper from which I removed skin & stem after allowing to cool- which went into the mixture along with the reserved liquid from the bell pepper which collected into tin foil on which it was roasted. Use 2 whole juicy lemons- a third might be called for- and slightly less than a teaspoon of Kosher salt.

Outstanding.

Loved this! I made my own tahini with a cup of toasted sesame seeds (brown in 350 degree oven for ten minutes stirring often, let seeds cool 20 minutes before mixing) and 1/3 cup olive oil. Mix together in blender until paste. Store up to three months in airtight container in refridgerator. I found the sesame seeds extremely cheap at Sprouts and our local 99 cent store. In the grocery store they were $4 a bottle in the international section. Much easier to find and cheaper then buying tahini premade and not difficult to make at all. Added a little cayenne pepper and a little less lemon juice. Garnished with fresh chopped cilantro for a spicier kick. Yum!

This was much closer to tasting like store-bought hummus than other recipes I've tried.  I added 1/2 jar of roasted red peppers and 3 cloves of garlic.  Next time I'll use less lemon juice.

I have tried a few variations of a basic hummus recipe, and have fallen in love with this one!  My first experience with hummus a few years ago was awful!  I don’t know what was wrong with it; I just knew it was not something I would ever try again… until a friend of mine tricked me.  She had made hors d ‘oeuvres for a small get together and had told me it was a “spread” for pita chips… needless to say, I can not get enough of it now.  I was paying a fortune at the grocery store for this wonderful creaminess and was looking to make my own.  This recipe is the best starting point!  This is always my base (give or take the amount of garlic) and I have experimented with other seasonings for anything from bold and spicy to mellow and sweet.

Awesome!  Followed the tips by submitter RoyHobbs (great name) in his review, and it came out perfect.  My young kids, who did not like my last attempt at homemade hummus, love this recipe.  It tastes like a fresh version of a good prepackaged hummus.

I followed the author's updated version and found it to be easy and tasty. The cumin adds great flavor.  I use only 1 clove of garlic, especially if it will sit for a day or so because the garlic becomes too obvious, in my opinion.  Also, I drained all the liquid from the beans, added the juice of the whole lemon and the olive oil to the processor.

Good base to start. The only thing I would suggest is to totally leave out the salt, it just isn't necessary with the lemon juice. I follow the rest of the recipe, including the author's suggestion of adding cumin (which I almost double), and I add 1/2 a fresh jalepeno.  Love it.  Thanks.

Wonderful recipe!  I add cumin and a dash of cayenne pepper.  If you don't have tahini you can also just add 3 tbsps of sesame seeds and puree.  (tahinin is sesame seed butter).

Not bad if you like canned beans.  I don't like the texture.  You can soak and cook beans pretty easily for a much more authentic "real" Hummus.  I also add a bit of cumin and an additional clove of garlic.  Less lemon and salt go into mine as well.  Best to do a little at a time and taste.

The best homemade hummus I have ever had... The whole batch was gone in one day. I added a tablespoon more of lemon juice and another clove of garlic. I also added 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the finished products and mixed it in instead of just pouring it on top. Those 3 changes made the perfect hummus!!

I actually live in the Middle East (Doha, Qatar) and with the "Recipe Update" comment below that the author made this stuff is perfectly on point. 

 I make this all the time now when I don't feel like taking the time to go out and get some!

This hummus was a little bland for me. I added a little more lemon juice and would recommend adding paprika or other spice.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and halved the amount of salt the recipe called for.  My suspicion is that the author of the recipe used salt-free (or reduced salt) canned garbonzo beans, in which case, a full teaspoon of salt would be perfect.  This makes great hummus, and is a perfect base recipe for those wanting to experiment with different flavorings.

Reduce that salt!  I read the reviews and actually completely omitted it.  I don't like salt.  I used a 15 ounce can of beans (do they make 19 oz?), 2 tbs tahini, 2 garlic cloves, and the lemon juice in the food processor.  I added reserved liquid to make creamy.  I seasoned with 1 tbp olive oil and cumin.  Delicioius.

This was an excellent base recipe, especially noting the author's revisions.  As with any recipe you can vary to meet personal preferences quite easily and still have a very classic hummus.  Also, an earlier reviewer mentioned boiling the chickpeas for 20 minutes prior to blending, and I found this very helpful.  I drained and rinsed the chickpeas, then boiled in fresh water, and reserved the water from the boiling and used this when blending all ingredients.  Last step, put the hummus in the fridge to chill before serving.  Again, a great base recipe.

Very good - with or without adding the olive oil, this recipe is very good!  Easy and much better  (and cheaper) than buying store bought.  I used crushed garlic in the jar and my magic bullet and this was done in a flash!  Garnish with a little paprika to add extra color like they do in many middle eastern restaurants!

I have a lemon tree and have made this recipe a few times already when I'm in the mood for fresh hummus! An excellent base to experiment with.  I add the cumin and salt to taste.  Sometimes I blend in sundried tomatoes or roasted red peppers.  Thanks for a fantastic, simple recipe!!!

Just like the hummus my Israeli-Canadian friend's dad made for her brother's bar mitzvah!  I really recommend making it the night before you want to use it to let the flavours blend better.  I don't know if it was my blender or what, but I had a few bland spots until it sat for a few hours.  I forgot to put in the pepper (oops) but otherwise did everything according to the recipe.  I use this as a mayo substitute on sandwiches, as well as using it on wraps.  Of course, it's also amazing with chips (pita, tortilla are best)

Very, very good.  I added an extra clove of garlic and a little more lemon.  Used water instead of liquid from beans. Cumin is a good option too but good with or without.

I did not care for this hummus, I am so disappointed! I spent half an hour just trying to get it to be smooth, what a nightmare! This is too lemony! I even roasted some of my garlic to make it taste better but no luck. I will NOT be making this again.

Very, very good.  I suggest that you adjust the garlic and lemon to how you will serve this.  When I use this as a sandwich spread with raw veggies I max out the garlic and lemon but when I am going to eat it as a dip I make it more mild.  Also, to add a wonderful, rich, nutty taste drizzle it with a tiny bit of toasted walnut oil before serving.

My pediatrician told me it would be fine to feed my almost one year old baby some hummus. We buy hummus at the store all the time, but I didn't want to feed her a store bought brand, as the ones I looked at had a warning on them saying they were manufactured at a plant that also handles shellfish (allergy alert). I followed this recipe exactly. It was wonderful! My daughter loved it, as did my two other children and husband. I will never buy hummus at the store again. Thank you so much for sharing this delicious and healthy recipe!

This was horribly bland. I had to add garlic (2T chopped) and chili powder (1/4 tsp) to get it to taste like anything. The recipe also called for "half the liquid reserved" but then didn't say what to do with it. Disappointing!

This is about a million times better than store bought hummus (I think commercially prepared kinds tend to be kind of sour tasting) and really easy to make! I just finished making my second batch, and used the author's updated version both times. The only thing I do differently is to add all the ingredients EXCEPT the chickpeas after chopping the garlic, blend for a few seconds to mix everything together, then blend the chickpeas in last.

This is great.  I'm Greek and this is authentic.  I cut the Tahini back a little because I don't like too much of it's flavor.  I also chopped up the garlic first and then put it in the food processor by itself for a few pulses - I hate garlic chunks in hummus!

Original Review (1/21/2007): I don't usually like hummus, but this one is very good.  Much better than anything I have store bought or in a resturaunt.

Current Review (10/13/2019): This has been one of those recipes that have stood the test of time in our house.  For 12 years, if anyone wants hummus, this is the only recipe we consider.  Rarely do we even buy hummus as it is so easy to make.  Follow the suggestions in the review from RoyHobbs .

I've made hummus many times, and this is very good. I made it as written except for more garlic (four cloves), less salt (about 1/2 t.) and about 1 t. of cumin instead of black pepper.. I used the reserved bean liquid as needed to get the right consistency, probably about 5 t., and added about 1 1/2t. green jalapeño sauce. That helped the consistency and added more tang than heat. I did not coat the top with oil, as this seemed like unnecessary added fat when making it for just the two of us. Maybe I'd try that if making for entertaining, but I don't see that it'd add enough to it to justify the extra calories? I think this is lighter than other hummus recipes I've made, as others use more EVOO to tweak the consistency instead of the reserved bean liquid. This was totally yummy as a dip for plain old cucumber slices, which made my blah snack a protein packed powerhouse! Thanks!!

I read the recipe update and followed those directions to make my hummus. It was PERFECT. We took it to a dinner party with good friends. Some of the guys there travel extensively with their jobs and they have had a lot of experience with non-American food. They were all very complimentary! Thank you for a great recipe that we will use again and again. (: Btw, the cumin really sets it off!

This was really easy to make.  I did not have tahini so I baked 1 cup of sesame seeds for 5 minutes then let them cool for about 20 minutes.  I blended in food processor with olive oil.  I stored in 1 cup mason jar which still has 3/4 of tahini after I made this recipe.  I added 2 cloves of garlic instead of one since I love garlic.  I tried adding the cumin instead of pepper and 3 tablespoons of tahini instead of 2.

Amazing!!!! Used minced garlic from a jar though(1 clove = 1 1/4 tsp). Absolutely no difference in taste. You can even get roasted minced garlic. I made a triple batch since all the girls wanted some. Turned out great! Cumin is a MUST! Served with warm flat bread slices and thin slices of cucumber. DELISH!

Never thought to use the can-bean water.  This was the most successfull Hummus I have ever made.  I doubled the recipe and then divided that in thirds.  Left one plain.  Stired roasted pepper/egplant spread from Sprouts in another, and pureed ONE chipotle in adobo in the third.  All were winners.  The Key is to whirl in the processor for a really long time.  OH...added a bit of extra garlic and also white pepper to the plain.

Warning: Definitely use canned chickpeas, and not dried/bulk ones. 

I tried this recipie with only 1tbsp olive oil, mixed in. It's really good. It has more of a tahini/savoury taste to it then the tangy-lemon store bought hummus. 

It's different than the store stuff, but really good and really easy.

I've made this four times now, and have gotten great results every time.  This is quick, simple, and delicious, and it is exactly how I expect a good, store-bought hummus to taste.  I have not yet tried adding specialty ingredients (roasted garlic, sun dried tomatoes, etc.) because the base recipe is so good on its own.  Thank you for sharing it!

Awesome! Nice and simple and really easy to make. I found this to be just perfect, but it's a recipe that can be easily modified if you don't like as much garlic or like more lemon.

A good starter recipe.   I did the following adjustments.   I did not add any salt or pepper, used 2 cloves of garlic, a half of a jalapeno seeded, and used 2 heaping TB of tahini.  I did not add olive oil.  I also squeezed juice of 1/2 of a lemon. garnished with sumac, and slivered almonds sauteed in olive oil, and fresh cucumbers and tomatoes.

Definitely follow recipe with updated amounts by author. I made a "tripled" batch for a family event. It was a great hit. I made my tahini from scratch (pan toasted sesame seeds blended with olive oil and a little sesame oil), so I added even more.  Made it again the other day and realized I was out of garbanzo beans, so I made it with white beans.  My husband says he is not a fan of hummus, but ended up eating 1/2 of a doubled recipe!  Thanks for the great recipe ROYHOBBS!!

I will be making a lot of this!  I boiled the beans for about 15 minutes and removed the skins that rose to the top.  I didn't have fresh lemon juice on hand but bottled worked just as well.  Really yummy and healthy snack with carrots or pretzels.

My husband and I made an amped up garlic version and it is out of this world! I also added some diced chipotle (on top, not mixed in) and it is so good I will never buy pre-made again. We were inspired to soak our own chickpeas because this recipe turned out so well.

We love this and make it all the time. I use dried garbanzo beans soaked over night. Then I drain it, cover with fresh water and cook until tender and keep them in the fridge ready to go. Because there isnt any can water to use, my husband adds veggie/chicken broth and the olive oil in it. Good pinch of cumin is amazing in it. We have also added roasted red peppers to it. This is a great recipe.

Good basic hummus recipe. Too salty for my taste, so you may want to taste it before adding the salt. I also added about a half teaspoon each of cumin and paprika. Yum!

I wish I had tried this recipe a long time ago instead of buying hummus!  I tinkered with the measurements a little bit until it was to my liking, but overall a great recipe.  I recently purchased OLIO extra virgine limone that I drizzled on top, which adds a nice touch.  I can see myself adding different veggies to this recipe to change it up. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!! Used the updated version posted in the review by the author and it tastes exactly like I wanted. DEFINITELY use chick peas you cooked yourself, not from the can! If you do, add water when pureeing to replace "liquid from the can" (which most likely contains A LOT of unnatural ingredients!) The cumin was great to! Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I tried it first with dried chickpeas that I had soaked overnight. I forgot to cook them first so the first batch was very dry! Then I used a can of chickpeas and it turned out perfectly! I accidentally put too much lemonjuice in it, but that was my fault, not the recipe's!

I recently have converted to veganism and have been paying 6.49 five days a week for a hummus wrap at Earth Fare.  I knew I could make a hummus wrap much cheaper from home but just needed the right hummus recipe!  This one is the first one I have ever tried and its great!  I followed the posters update and used more tahini and two large garlic cloves, next time I will only use one large or two small.  I may add the remainder of the chick peas from the second can (had to get 2-15oz cans) to even out the garlic flavor but I dont mind it, just trying to be cautious of my hubby and co-workers..lol.  I can't wait to try this again and possibly use other yummy ingredients :)

This was pretty good. I followed the original submitter's revised instructions. It's just frustrating that you have to dig through the reviews to find the "real" recipe, so to speak. It was hard to get a creamy texture. I tried my blender, mini chopper, and a hand mixer. Wondering if I need a food processor or a better blender.

Yum, yum, yum!   This is great!  When I checked the can of beans I bought, it was 15.5 ounces, not 19.  So I kind of guessed on downscaling the other ingredients.  I ended up using one large garlic clove, and the garlic taste is fairly strong...which is ok by me, but if I were to bring this somewhere I'd cut back on the garlic.  Oh and I forgot the salt in the blender so I sprinkled it on afterwards, with the pepper.  I'm  sure I didn't use anywhere near a teaspoon.  I will be making it again and again and again...can't see myself buying it at the store any more...

Perfect basic hummus recipe! I add my own variations--extra garlic and roasted red bell pepper is my favorite. I also use only 1/2 tsp of salt as suggested. This is in my fridge nearly all the time and I use it as a sandwhich spread, a 'sauce' for my vegan pita pizzas, dip, the uses are nearly limitless :)

This recipe worked great for me. The only adjustment I made was to reduce the amount of lemon juice (I'm not a big fan of tart hummus....hence 4 stars instead of 5.) I also tried a batch with about two tablespoons of sun dried tomato paste in it... tastes great too! Be creative and add different flavors! Have fun!

Overall really great hummus recipe. I've made some changes that I think readers would appreciate.   Rather than using raw garlic I roast about half a  garlic clove in olive oil for 20 minutes before adding it. (toaster oven or normal oven 350) In addition, I add 2tsp cumin (sometimes more, up to the chef) cumin and 1tsp ground chili peppers.   Making hummus from scratch is just amazing! You'l never buy pre-made from the store again!

This is a great recipe. I followed ROYHOBBS' updated recipe pretty closely, but instead of the raw garlic gloves, I used 3 cloves of ROASTED garlic that I had leftover in the fridge. I've used raw garlic in the past, but I find that by day 2 or 3, the garlic gets too sharp and overpowering and will give you super garlic breath! Roasting the garlic will keep the hummus mellow tasting.  I added about a heaping 1/2 tsp of cumin and found that to be enough.   Another tip: If you have the time (and patience) -- slip the skins off the garbanzo beans. Just pop them off by squeezing the bean through your fingers. This will make your hummus ultra smooth. A famous chef once recommended this. I do this sometimes, but not always.

Good recipe. Don't be afraid of the 1 teaspoon of salt, it's not super salty once you finish the recipe. If you're still not too sure about using so much salt, add it slowly & taste. I did this and the 1tp was actually not overpowering like I thought it would be.

Our favorite restaurant serves hummus with a balsamic & brown sugar reduction: approx. 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, heat in a shallow pan until the mixture is reduced by 1/3 (approx. 5 min., use oven vent or open a window while doing this!). Pour over hummus, pour 1/4 cup of good quality olive oil, sprinkle of fresh cracked pepper & you have an elegant appetizer!

Well... I ran out of lemon juice and olive oil, so I could only use 2 Tbl. of lemon juice and only about 1-1/2 Tbl. olive oil. Needless to say it wasn't very good. Next time I'll be sure to have ALL ingredients before starting..LOL

This is pretty good.  I like the little bit of cumin in it.  I use just a pinch of salt, as I don't generally like my foods very salty.  Please forgive me ROYHOBBS, but I couldn't find Tahini and in a pinch used almond butter instead.  In the past I've also used peanut butter.  Both make a pretty good substitute.  I know, I know, this is not real hummus when made that way.  I am aware of that.  But I have also made and eaten 'real hummus' many times, and so I can compare and say it makes a good substitute, though obviously it doesn't quite measure up.  I rarely follow recipes to the letter, so I was looking for a good, basic hummus recipe to use as a base and tinker with to my taste.  This recipe served excellently for that.

Here's the real recipe and it's really easy,step by step, all in a food processor.Make Tahini: 2 shaker-sized containers toasted sesame seeds and about 1/2C.EVOO.LIQUEFY. Next add up to 1 full bulb peeled garlic(I LOVE LOTS of GARLIC), or no less than 3 cloves. 1 can garbanzo beans with all of the juice,and the juice of 1 fresh lime. A dash of cumin(opt.)Blend on high, stop and scrape sides to fully mix, blending altogether 1 to 1 and a 1/2 mins on high. Sprinkle paprika. serve with pita bread. Sorry for hijacking, but this is the real deal.

Used two cloves of garlic and no olive oil. Also had to make my own tahini, as where I am located (Moscow, Russia) couldn't find it anywhere - that was a pain. The end result was superb. Exactly as I'd expect in any restaurant.

I've finally found a hummus recipe I LOVE.  I only used 3 tbsp of lemon juice, half the salt, 5 tbsp of the chickpea liquid, and I also added 1/2 tsp dill (because I love dilly hummus).  I blended the oil right into the hummus, and left it in the fridge a few days to blend the flavours.  Delicious!

This is a great basic hummus recipe. I added more garlic (about 2.5 tbs) because I like a real garlicky hummus. Also, I noticed that the longer it sits in my fridge, the better it gets. :)

I made this per the author's revised edition (found in Reviews). This is The Best Hummus I have ever tasted. I slow cooker'd garbanzo beans in salted water instead of using canned, and also ended up adding a wee bit more olive oil, as well as some red pepper flakes because I like a little heat:-) I made the hummus in the food processor and didn't chop any garlic beforehand, just threw everything in there together and blended, adding the bean liquid as needed for the texture I wanted.

With some whole wheat pitas, my handsome genius of a husband and I made a whole meal out of it. However delicious it is when first made, however, I must say it is even better after a night in the fridge. The flavors meld beautifully and there is no discernable tahini flavor. The raw garlic also mellows a bit. Thank you for the great recipe. And if I can be forgiven for channeling Scarlet O'Hara - "...with God as my witness, I will never buy hummus again!"

Finally!  The hummus recipe I've been looking for!  Who knew it could be so easy?  

I failed to read the author's updates, so I made the recipe in its original form, with two tablespoons of tahini.  I'm looking forward to trying three.  

Delicious and easy to "personalize" with added juice from the beans, more or less garlic, more or less lemon, etc.  

If you're looking for great hummus, look no further!

Very good - I think maybe the salt amount would be ok if you were using the low sodium chick peas (S & W brand is what I used - excellent!) - also, substituted 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil for one tablespoon of olive oil, to add a nutty flavor to enhance the tahini, and zested the lemon peel and added it - oh, and Mark Bittman's recipe has 1 tablespoon of cumin, so I used that much (love cumin!) and about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne. This is excellent. This will be a staple in our home, and will be our take-with for parties!

Extremely simple.  Of course - like most - I changed the recipe!  4 gloves garlic chopped BEFORE adding to blender, 1 15oz can beans with 1/2 liquid, juice of 1 1/2 lemons, 2 TBL Tahini, dash of salt, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  Blend, pour into container and pour 2 TBL EVOO over the top.

An amazing garlic hummus! I used only 3 tbsp of lemon juice and didn't find a need for the olive oil or any salt or seasonings. Perfect with just one 16oz can garbanzo beans, some juice to make it creamy in the blender, 2 cloves garlic, 3 tbsp lemon juice, and 3 tbsp tahini. So yummy with warm whole wheat pita bread and took all of 5 minutes to make!

This really hit the spot when I was craving hummus. Great, simple recipe. The only change I really made was to cut out the olive oil. I found it unneccessry, because it was creamy and perfect already. And I try and cut calories wherever I can. I added the lemon juice slowly, but found the amount listed to be just about right.

Used the cumin instead of pepper as suggested.  I didn't need much of the garbanzo bean liquid at all.  This has been the best hummus recipe I've made.

Great Hummus. • 
Here are the exact  proportions I wound up with after following the author's updates  (and having to cope with low sodium 15oz chick peas).  • 

2 cloves (8 grams) garlic • 
400ml or 1 and 2/3 cups drained chick peas (1 central market 15 oz can low sodium) • 
1/4-1/2 cup of the reserved juice (depending on pref for thick or thin) • 
2TBS + 1tsp lemon juice • 
3 TBS tahini • 
1 tsp table salt exactly. • 
1/2 tsp ground cumin. Just enough to start tasting it over the garlic. • 

The full tsp of salt made up for the fact that the chickpeas happened to be low in sodium.  • Saltiness was in perfect balance with tart from lemon.  • 
 • I took the amount of lemon down til it was in balance with the cumin  • 
To me the cumin is essential to get the flavor that I know from various restaurants. • 
This will be my go-to recipe from now on.  •

Authentic or real hummus is made with dry chick peas that you soak. Just soak overnight.  Out of a can is not the best tasting.  Otherwise the recipe is good. I'm middle eastern and there are many variations.  You have to tinker with it a bit.

This is MY recipe ;) except that I use 4 cloves of garlic in the dried garbanzos I cook. I sometimes find that the canned ones have a tinny taste. Just me, maybe, but in a slow cooker they cook just fine during the day. The updated recipe by this author is how I learned it from some Israeli friends of mine, with the cumin and some raw garlic added once you start blending. I also grate the lemon before juicing it and adding the 2 T of juice from it. 1 T of salt added to the cooking garbanzos means that the cooking liquid will be salty. So as I add cooking liquid during the blending I can add plain hot water if I feel it's getting too salty. I was looking for a recipe close to what I remembered being taught and this was it. Thanks, Mr. Hobbs. You were closest to the mark! The olive oil is used ONLY as a garnish and not as a way to change the consistency. Just a note ..

The trick to hummus is the order in which you add the ingredients to the food processor. I always add equal parts lemon juice and tahini first and process it. It will whip into a thick light colored creamy paste, which is different than if you just add straight tahini to the mixture. There is no other way to get the same creamy consistency. Then add whatever else in what ever order you want, it won't make much of a difference. 

Canned and dried chickpeas make an inappreciable difference, and for the amount of work it takes to make dried chickpeas, just buy the can. 

Cumin and/or paprika are both acceptable spice additions.

It's on track, but the garlic and salt taste were really overwhelming for our family. We eat hummus nearly every day, so I decided to make our own. To adjust for our taste, we added an additional can of beans, a little more tahini and lemon juice, skipped the pepper and added a couple sprinkles of cumin instead. It's really quite good now. So in the end, cut the salt in half, skip the pepper, add some cumin and this is a 5 star recipe. We whipped it really, really smooth and topped with a little fresh parsley.

This gets 5 stars for ease, and flavor.  I added extra garlic, my olive oil was also garlic infused.  I used a garlic salt seasoning instead of straight salt.  Can you tell we love garlic?..lol  I actually used 1.5 cans of garbanzo beans and added the reserved liquid as needed to smooth it out.  I used fresh cracked black pepper.  It was excellent. Hubby inhaled it!

Easy peasy and fabulous.  Homemade chick peas/ Garbanzo beans, 5 or 6 cloves of fresh garlic, cumin & a bit of onion were the changes I made.  I could eat the whole bowl!

Great recipe!  I only had 2 oz of Sesame seeds in the house and no time to hunt down tahini here on the Irish Rivera. I know from experience our grocery stores don't even know what it is. I made a mini batch  of Tahini using http://www.cinnamonspiceandeverythingnice.com/how-to-make-tahini-paste/ which was very easy.  So for this hummus recipe I only had about 1 Tablespoon of tahini.  Because I used fresh tahini it had a very dominant Sesame flavor and didn't need more.  I did double the garlic, and if I had time would have used some lemon zest for even more lemon flavor.  To avoid gas I rinsed the beans and added very little water, it didn't need it.  I didn't do cumin because some people just don't like it but I will add it next time when I make it for myself.  I cut way back on the salt and it was fine for my taste.  Our guest ate nearly all of it including picky kids.  Thank you for sharing!

It's good as it, but I use it as a base and go from there. My favorite proportions are: 2 cloves garlic, 1 can (15 oz.) beans, 4 TB lemon, 3 TB tahini, salt as needed. Also, I use cumin instead of pepper. For a fun twist, I sometimes add roasted red pepper (from a jar). One thing I think is important is to drain and rinse your beans, and use regular water instead of the can juice. It makes the beans taste fresher, and I don't use much water anyway. My kids love this!

Followed the author's updated suggestions (most helpful review).  Fantastic!  Definitely tastes so much better than the store-bought stuff!

This recipe is great. After following it a few times, I have a few suggestions. Instead of using 1/2 of the juice from the can, I substitute 1/3 cup of water with salt. I do this because I do not want to consume the preservatives in the can water. I also use 3 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of 4 (About 1.5 small lemons). And Sometimes I add a bit of sage, thyme, rosemary, or parsley from the garden for taste.

This is a good basic guideline for hummus.. as suggested by others it is easily tweaked to suit individual preferences (more lemon, garlic, salt, cumin, etc).

ABOUT THE SALT:
I noticed many reviewers complained about it being too salty, so I was cautious when adding salt.. I ended up including the full amount (1tsp) and still did not find the hummus salty at all. 

I wonder if the people who had trouble with this were using canned chick peas with added salt.. It is important to look at the ingredients in canned goods. Unless it is specifically stated "no salt added," most canned foods have A LOT of salt added in already...   

I would imagine hummus made with salty chick peas + salty water from the can + additional teaspoon of salt would in fact turn out very salty :)

Very good, easy hummus! I made mine in the Baby Bullet and reduced the amount of lemon to 3 tbsp. to cut back on the lemon flavor just a little bit.

This is a great recipe!  I add a good 5-10 shakes of cumin, and then more to taste when eating.  I also use all the garbanzo beans.  Skip the black pepper and olive oil.

Good but need to decrease salt to personal taste, this is too salty.  Very easy to make and fast to prepare.  Next time I plan to use only olive oil, didn't like the tahini oil. I added cayenne pepper!

Excellent! I took this hummus to a potluck and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I might add a little more garlic next time, but that's because I'm a garlic nut.

I did not like this at all.  I think it would have been better with roasted garlic and less lemon juice.  Between the raw garlic and the lemon juice it was overly acidic.  Normally I love lemon but this was a bit much even for me.

Easy, tasty hummus! This was my first time using a recipe for hummus (I usually just improvise and add to taste), and it turned out great. It has a nice texture and great strong garlic flavor. I normally add roasted red peppers and will do the same next time since we prefer the taste & color the peppers add. This is a great base recipe & I can't wait to experiment with adding other foods.

This was an easy recipe, and I used my dried chickpeas that i cooked in the slow cooker.  Tastes great, a little thick, but still awesome none the less.  I may have used more chickpeas than what was required in the ingredients..plus almost all of the cooking liquid from the slow cooker was gone.  I have a blender/mini food processer combo appliance...DID NOT work in the blender, so I had to switch to the food processor instead.  It probably would have been no sweat if I had a bigger-capacity processor.

This was my first attempt at homemade hummus and it turned out great!  I used some of the suggestions in the comments (only used 1/2 tsp salt), used more lemon (I LOVE lemon) probably just shy of two lemons, I added a bit more garlic and a pinch of cayenne.  I can't wait to eat it for dinner tonight and it makes such a great healthy snack during the week!  Thanks for sharing the recipe and to everyone else for their suggestions.  I will def be making this again.

I am so addicted to this recipe, I make it at least once a week. However, I add at least 3 minced cloves of garlic (hummus is all about the garlic!) and as another poster mentioned, 3 heaping tbs of tahini, and 1/2 tsp of salt. A definite keeper, thank you!!

I added an extra T of tahini to make it more creamy.  And some extra garlic too.  I found this recipe to be more lemony than others I have tried but I thought it was delish!

I've been making hummus for a long time, and this recipe is very authentic.  For an even better flavor, try lime juice instead of the lemon.  You also need 2 cloves of garlic, and use cumin instead of the black pepper.

I love that it's simple. I made a huge batch, separated it into tupperware, a little olive oil and paprika on top and I froze it.   I used a little more tahini and tripled the garlic.  I also used a bit of water to make it super smooth.

I have been buying hummus for years now and have finally decided to try to make my own.  I am not a "cook" but I followed this recipe, adding cumin and extra garlic as many of the reviewers suggested, and it came out quite tasty.  I am pretty sure that my days of buying hummus are over.

This was delicious!!!  I sprinkled a tiny amount of stevia, and hot sauce at the end.  I also only used 3 T. of lemon, and half the salt. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Great recipe, I like the second version (update)  also just a tiny bit less lemon and it is simply perfect.  This is the first time I have made hummus, it will become one of those things that I make all the time.

Great & Easy hummus!  All of my guests loved it.  I used the changes from the recipe author & this was a great recipe!  I wound up having to buy a giant bottle of tahini....guess I'll have to make more hummus ;-)  Thank you for the recipe!!

Very good.  I might use a little less lemon juice next time and more garlic, but I like garlic.  Also did the recipe authors suggestion of adding cumin.  Nice to not have to buy at the store.

I loved this recipe - much better than anything I have ever bought in the store.  I omitted the lemon juice and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Next time I will add other ingredients to jazz it up but this will always be my base recipe.

This is yummy! I start with 2/3 cup of dried chickpeas and soak and cook them. Even without using canned beans which have salt, 1 teaspoon of salt is enough for my husband and me. The olive oil on top is a plus!

I thought this was great! Way better than the store variety. I added a jalepeno to spice it up and it added a nice flavor, not too hot.

I substituted the black pepper for cumin as suggested. Used 3 heaping tbsps of tahini and one clove that equaled 3 small cloves of garlic. I reserved but only used about half of the can of juice from the garbanzo beans. Besides what I consider to be minor changes, I followed the recipe exactly. Spot on. So good!

I like to dice a small amount of jalapenos and soak them in lemon juice to add as a "topping" when eating hummus. I had this at a restaurant that is no longer here - Castle Cafe.

This Hummus is Awesome!  I am so glad I found one that is similar to a local restuarants.  I will use a little less garlic next time, but my search for a hummus recipe is over!

At first taste this turned out AWFUL, but I'm not sure it it was the recipe or not.  I think I had some not so great Olive Oil, but I could also taste a little too much of the Tahini.   I salvaged it by adding some onion powder, coriander and cilantro.  After that, it was AWESOME!

This recipe is essentially the same as Hummus III that has such high ratings... for instance 4 T lemon juice is the same as 1/4 cup. I use cumin and paprika, lots of fresh raw garlic and home-made tahini. Fresh lemon juice is the best, and I add a little citric acid at the end if it's not zingy enough and I want to keep the same consistency. Very easy making it with canned garbanzos, but a real cook would certainly soak dry beans overnight and either make raw-bean hummus or then cook them and do it traditional. I basically use a rough estimate of this recipe and Hummus III and then triple the recipe for a large batch.

Very good, basic hummus.  I strayed only slightly from the recipe - a little more garlic and tahini, and added cayenne pepper. I used cumin instead of black pepper.

Okay, WOW! I just made this with all the edited suggestions by the original author (= 2 cloves of garlic instead of one, 3 tbsp tahini instead of 2, and cumin instead of black pepper), and I'm blown away -- it's PERFECTION.   I also added some fresh coriander leaves. NUM! I don't think this will last until the party tomorrow (and I don't usually even like hummus that much)! :D

I make hummus at least once a weak and I used to discard the liquid in the can , but after trying this I have to admit that the liquid makes difference , it gives the hummus a stronger flavor . I always add cumin .

We love this recipe, its a good place to start when learning how to make hummus, because any add-in you want can come from this as a start and it would work. I agree with others though, I do not care for the name of this recipe.

WOW...great recipe. Thanks for sharing. I read your suggestions and used the 2 cloves of garlic, and cumin (instead of black pepper). I used the juice of half a lemon and a little lime juice. I omitted the olive oil. Really delicious!!!

This was exactly the flavor I was looking for! I added one extra clove of garlic since we love garlic. I soaked about a cup of dry garbanzos overnight and cooked them 'fresh' for the recipe. Excellent!

This is the best hummus recipe I have ever found.  It's perfect and delicious!  Even my husband who is leery of any "foreign" food scarfs it down.

I made this as per the updated instructions.  Fabulous!  The only things I changed were a little less lemon juice and I also added a shake of a mediterranean seasoning blend that I have.  I've never made hummus before but I think this will be a staple.  Super delicious and very good for you.

Really tasty. If ou are going to add more garlic, i would advise you to roast it. Raw garlic can be "hot" and overpowering (and this is coming from a true garlic lover). I put two cloves of raw garlic in this at first and i had to double the amount of chickpeas just to avoid burning my tongue when i ate it. so i would say to be careful with the garlic. use 1 clove and then taste the hummus before deciding to double up.   However, the recipe as is - just delicious. I will make it again in a heartbeat. Also - there is recipe for tahini cookies on here that makes good use of the jar of tahini you will have sitting around:) Thanks very much!

The hummus that I make at home is nearly the same. I don't add any salt to it though.. I either roast my garlic or put it in a pan with a little olive oil and then put it in a food processer along with everything else. Some people like it with more garlic.. others more lemon. It just depends on my mood. I add more of one of the other. :)

I really liked this recipe! I added cumin and roasted red peppers (per other reviews) and a little bit more tahini. I had been using a recipe that called for about 3 times more tahini, so this surprised me. I really liked it this way, though, and I'll probably keep making it this way!

This was a good starting point for hummus, but know that you'll always have to taste it and play with the ingredients to get the proportions that you like.  Everyone's different.  I never have tahini on hand, so I use toasted sesame seeds and they work just fine.

So very yummy!  I wanted to use this in wraps and sandwiches, so I wanted it pretty thick and ended up using less than 1/4 cup of the reserved liquid. Thanks to the updates of the author, I added 1 Tbsp more tahini (peanut butter is NOT an acceptable substitute) and used 1/2 tsp of salt. I put the beans, minced garlic (2 cloves), tahini, and lemon juice into my food processor and blended and then added everything else as it was mixing.  I ended up using about 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp black pepper.  Lastly, I just blended in the olive oil since I am not using it as a dip.  It's perfect and we LOVE it!

If you use canned garbanzos you should check if salt is added. I prefer to cook the dryed ones. I agree on adding the lemon (everything really) slowly and tasting- I prefer less, but it's all taste. I probably added 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin. Good recipe.

Great starting point for a base, put all the ingredients in a food processor and blended until I had the consistency I wanted. 
The first time making it I used a 15 ounce can of Garbanzo Beans(not drained), 2 frozen cloves of Garlic, juice of 1/2 lemon, 1-2 teaspoons Kosher Salt, 2 tbsp's extra virgin olive oil, 2 heaping tbsp's tahini. I then blended it in a food processor, the consistency was a bit to liquid for me.
I then made a second batch and used another 15 ounce can of Garbanzo Beans(drained), 4 cloves of frozen garlic, 3 heaping tbsp's of Tahini, juice of 1/2 lemon. Much thicker consistency this time. I combined the two and it was perfect.

Made the recipe as is, except removed the skins from the chickpeas beforehand.  At first I thought it was too lemony, but the next day the flavors set in to make it much better.  Next time I will use dried chickpeas that I soak overnight with 1 tb baking powder, drain and rinse, then simmer for 2-3 hrs.  I like the taste and consistency much better that way.  I might also add a bit of plain yogurt to make the consistency more creamy.

Awesome! We only had store bought hummus prior to this recipe and were not big fans. We really like this dip now and make it often. We followed Roy's update and we also rinsed the canned chickpeas and boiled them for 20 min. in fresh water. We used 1/2 can of the boiled  water for mixing. We also used extra virgin olive oil.

This is excellent!  I have tried hummus several times, but was disappointed but with the list of ingredients, I should have liked it.  I guess you just have to make it yourself!  Thanks for the recipe.

this  is the original hummus recipe but don't use black pepper or cumin.Also tastes great if you cooked ground meat with chopped onions salt, black pepper and fried pine nuts in the top.

This is probably the best recipe for hummus on this site, but you do have to make a few adjustments to make it come out right. First, it is very thick, so you will have to thin it out with either the liquid from the beans (although you get a slight after-taste when you do this), or you can add some vegetable or chicken broth (even water, if you don't have the broth). I doubled the garlic, because if you don't, you can't really taste the garlic and hummus really should have a stronger garlic taste. I also doubled the lemon juice, but if you used fresh lemon juice you probably wouldn't have to do that. The last addition I made was adding some fresh parsley.
I have to say that I don't agree with having to peel the beans before mixing - I have tried this in the past and not only is it VERY time consuming, but it doesn't make that much of a difference in the overall taste (unless you are a serious hummus connoisseur, that is!)

Don't use liquid from can! Peeling Garbanzos is key to smooth Hummus. Added 1/4 cup veggie broth to make for missing liquid. Excellent!

This is pretty good for a hummus base, even hubby likes it right when I made it.  We can't wait to taste it chilled.  One of my favorite brands of hummus from the store comes in a Greek Olive flavor.  I'm going to get some olives tomorrow and blend them in.  Thanks for sharing.

I halved the salt and glad I did, I felt it was plenty salty.  Very garlicy!  Next time may roast it to tone down the flavor.  Will make again.

This always comes out fantastic.  I tried oven roasting the garlic before adding it - I had to double the amount, but roasting the garlic got rid of the harsh acidic flavour that fresh garlic sometimes has.  It was very nice.

Fabulous!!  Why buy hummus when it's so easy to make at home?

I used the 3tbls tahini, and increased the garlic to about 6 cloves (I LOVE garlic).

This hummus was a big hit served with Peppy's Pita Bread at a get together I went to.

Wow! Good hummus! I did use lime juice today instead of lemon, but it is incredible tasting. Thanks for sharing.

First, a tip for making sure you don't end up with chunks of garlic:  Blend up everything but the chickpeas for about a minute first.  I've made this recipe so many times.  When you first make it, it tastes wonderful.  When you let it sit in the fridge overnight, it's even better.  The best thing is that it's so easy to make, easier than getting into your car and driving to the store/restaurant for sure.  I've been known to eat this by the spoonful or on plain wheat bread.

Just delicious! I used three garlic cloves instead of one (I really love garlic!) and  incorporated the olive oil during blending. The results was a flavor better than any hummus I have ever purchased from the supermarket. Will definitely make again.

I don't like Garbanzo beans (and, so, then, neither does my family). But I DO like Hummus (restaurant style; not so much supermarket offerings). Anyway, I substituted Cannellini beans for the Garbanzos when preparing this (as written), served it to my family (beside lamb chops and broccoli) and it was a GREAT HIT! I made it for myself one afternoon, substituting Pink Pinto beans (what I had available) while indulging in Triscuits. What a JOY!) I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because, while I KNOW that Garbanzo beans are traditional when making Hummus, I refuse to fault either the recipe or the submitter of it simply because I, personally, felt it appropriate to substitute my preference for the recipe's main ingredient.

I love Hummus! We eat this a lot with taboulie and greek marinated chicken breast. This is a wonderful meal and it's very healthy. Although I tend to add more garlic to give it that extra spice kick that it needs and instead of adding the juice from the garbanzo beans I add plain yogurt! Aboslutely Yummy!

Most cans of garbanzo beans come in a 15 1/2 oz. size, so you will need to buy 2 cans.  I didn't realize that I had only used 15 1/2 oz. until after I made it.  It was definitley too salty!  However, after I added some more beans to it, and a bit more tahini it turned out pretty good.

I've made this a few times, and it's much easier in a blender. I used the food processor the first time and it came out chunky.  Tastes like hummus from one of my favorite restaurants!

I've made hummus at home before, but without much success.  This recipe was delightful!  I added extra garlic though, as my BF and I love it.  I plan to make this every saturday for the week!

Great recipe!  I made the suggested changes and topped it off with paprika instead of pepper or cumin.  This was my first homemade hummus.  Next time, I'll hold even more whole garbonzo beans aside to top off the hummus - the variety of textures is great!  Thanks!

I made the author's modified version and it turned out wonderful!  It was creamy and flavorful.  I lived in Israel for a few months and this easily compared to hummus I ate there. An excellent recipe that I will use again and again.

Great hummus! (my family says needs more
garlic).  I started with dry chickpeas;
I think it will take about 1 cup dry to 
make this recipe.

Yum! I made changes as per the author's review. I only used 1/2 tsp salt and cumin to taste (and lots of it) instead of pepper. I added the liquid from the beans a little at a time until I got a desirable consistency. I also added some smoked paprika. I forgot to add the olive oil and didn't miss it - that made it a little lower calorie too! Oh! And if you are not a garlic fan, you might want to cut down a little.

I've made this several times, most recently last week for a neighbors daughter, and the two of them ended up eating the whole container with crackers and skipped dinner!  Sometimes I add cayenne if I don't have fresh peppers, or use jalapenos from a jar.
Very good, thanks!

Awesome job, really important to read the early post from the "chef", it clarifies the whole "how many cloves of garlic" question, especially for novice cooks like me! My friends and I loved it! So easy and WAY cheaper!

Excellent.  Absolutely excellent.  I didn't realize how easy it is to make Hummus also a ton cheaper to make it yourself.  I will make homemade Hummus from now on.  I didn't follow the instructions exactly, I was just looking for base recipe and I basically eyeballed and tasted while I was making and it turned out great.

I only make this using a food processor. Place tahini & olive oil in processor first. Blend. Then add lemon juice, garlic & spices. Blend. Add beans & blend. Then add reserved water from can until desired texture is achieved.

Very good.  I've made this a number of times.  This time I made the modifications per ROYHOBBS.  I used cumin instead of black pepper, etc.  Also, I have a very good bottle of Olive Oil this time, and was surprised what a big difference that made, too.  This will continue to be one of our favorite snacks.

Absolutely delicious! I used the cumin instead of pepper as suggested by royhobbs update. I will never buy store bought again. Super easy. Thank you so much. I did need to use a bit of the reserved juice from the beans to get the texture I wanted.

The absolute best hummus recipe out there! I used the revised instructions from the author using cumin and the extra tbs of tahini. Tastes exactly like the hummus from the Lebanese restaurant we order from. My kids will not stop eating it - even our pickiest one keeps diving in! This is definitely a keeper :) Thanks for such a delicious and healthy snack.

Used garlick powder, cumin, tahini, cashews, paprika, Tabasco for a little zing and will never buy the store stuff again.

This is the first time we have made hummus. I like the fact that it is so cheap to make. To think we were spending about five dollars a week on the store bought stuff. I wonder what else we can make ourselves and save some money on? It tasted pretty good if you ask me! Not bad for our first try!

This was really good.  I made it as adapted by the cook -- adding cumin, and 4 tablespoons tahini (which I made from a recipe also on this site), and it is delicious!  Next time I will add just a bit less liquid from the can to make it a bit thicker, but it is great just as it is.  Thanks!

This is essentially the same recipe that I use with the exception that I add 1/2 teaspoon if cumin and a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Also it is easier to make in a food processor than a blender. For the person who said it is too salty, I do not salt mine until I have processed the batch. Then I taste and add salt a little at a time pulsing between additions. It always requires a little salt to bring out the flavor. As far as the liquid is concerned, I reserve the liquid from the beans and add it a tablespoon at a time as I am processing. Usually it takes about 4 tablespoons to yield the silky smooth texture that we enjoy. One final note, if you enjoy flavored hummus, I have made this adding one head of roasted garlic, 1/3 cup of roasted red peppers or 1/4 cup of calamata olives. Just be sure to add these ingredients before adjusting with the liquid because they all contain some moisture. When adding olives omit salting until after it has set awhile.

Great recipe! The can of garbanzo beans is actually 15 oz., so use part of a second can. I also added 4 T. of olive oil right into the food processer and about 1/3 of the liquid in the can of beans. Came out very creamy and tasty. I always sprinkle the top with paprika for presentation.

I had hummus for the first time at the home on an Indian family who'd recently come to the US.  I loved it.  This is the closest recipe I've found.  They used home made tahini but the lady told me that sometimes she couldn't find tahini or sesame seeds, so she used a few drops of sesame oil.  Be careful though, the oil is strong and it's easy to over do it. I've used it instead of paying the insane price for tahini.  I definitely like the cumin in place of pepper.

I made this recipe exactly as written only subbing 410g boiled and drained, unsalted chickpeas for the canned variety. I believe the amount of lemon is off, personally. I think that 2 Tbsp of lemon is sufficient. So, as others have suggested, add the lemon gradually. Otherwise, the amounts seem right on. Thank you RoyHobbs for your recipe.

Very good.  I had. 15 oz can of the garbanzo beans so cut back just a little bit on rest of the ingredients. I did go with just 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice because I didn't want it to be too lemony. Otherwise it turned out great.

We loved it!  Per other suggestions I added 1/2 tsp salt, otherwise I followed directly taking tips from the authors comments too.  I like mine on the thinner side, so I used more of the liquid.  I like the lemon so I used the full amount too.  Thanks!  Delish!

I really REALLY love this recipe! Every time I make hummus I always come back to use this recipe. Besides the author's alterations, the only thing I change about the recipe is I always add double the lemon. But I am a citrusy person :D

This is the second recipe for hummus from Allrecipes that I've tried, and I like it best.  I saw the updates from the author, and used the 3 tbs of tahini, plus added some cumin.  I also soaked and boiled dry garbonzos (sooo fast and easy with a digital pressure cooker), so I increased the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.
From previous experience I knew two cloves of raw garlic was too strong for me, so I sliced one of them and sauteed in a little of the garlic oil.  The other I left raw.  I added lemon juice to taste, probably only 2 Tbs.
I also added a few sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil. Very nice recipe.

YUM! I've tried a few different recipes for humus and this one is a winner.  I'm a garlic lover so I added a little bit more and I blended the olive oil into the humus. I also read some of the reviews before making so I cut the salt in half.

This is delicious! My local grocery chain store wanted $7.51 for 16 oz of tahini. I got the exact same jar at a little Indian market for only $4.99.  I've tried several humus recipes and this is my favorite. I also prefer the cumin but I use a little in addition to the black pepper.

Delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made it with 4 lg. cloves of garlic (it was a bit garlicky) and everything else pretty much as written.  Used 1 tsp. cumin and put it all into the Vitamix.  It was awesome and I'll be using this recipe from now on.  Thanks, RoyHobbs - it's a real keeper.

This is the first time I made hummus and it is perfect.  I used 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, the juice of one lemon, half the liquid from the chickpeas and no salt.  Also did not use the olive oil.  Love it!  I will definitely make it again.

I whipped this up according to the recipe posted using some freshly cooked garbanzo beans.  I had everything in the pantry and it is a wonderful tasting hummus!  I'm sure I'll make this again and again.

Great fast recipe for hummus! I tweaked it a bit (added more garlic and a small onion). I also didn't add the liquid from the beans (I like it thick).

So I just made this recipe and it is delicious.  I only had a 15.5 oz can of Garbanzo but I did bring the salt down to 1/2 tsp kosher and used 3 Tbsp lemon juice.  I didn't have any cumin on hand and had to go with black pepper but everything else I had.  I also added the olive oil to the blender and ground everything together.  This is absolutely delicious.  Will definitely make again.  About to cut up some fresh garden veggies so that I can go make a hummus wrap.  Thanks for this recipe.

I love this recipe! I did increase garlic to 2 cloves, reduced lemon to 3 tbsp, and added 1/2 tsp of cumin instead of pepper. I add the olive oil into the hummus instead of drizzling. I always drain and rinse the beans first and process until it is creamy and smooth. It turns out perfect every time!

It was my first time making hummus. I doubled the garlic, reduced the salt, added reserved juices and lemon juice to taste, and offered extra olive oil on the side for my guests. Making more tomorrow and will try cumin instead of pepper.

So much better than anything store bought! I did as ROYHOBBS updated recipe suggestion said and omitted the pepper,substituted cumin and added the extra TBS of tahini (3TBS total). In addition, since we prefer things a bit more garlicky and spicy, I added many more cloves of garlic and also some cayenne pepper.

Since I had never made hummus before, I was looking for a basic recipe that would just tell me how it is done, and this one worked nicely.  I didn't have any garlic in the house and I am not a fan of pepper so I omitted both of those. I also used avocado oil and a mix of salt and sugar (instead of just salt) that I had leftover from another recipe.  Turns out it was still terrific.

this recipe is amazing! I used 2 tsp. minced garlic, no oil because i wasn't serving it right away, and added 2 tsp of some really hot salsa. the result? I very spicy and truly addicting hummus! I cooked dry beans in my pressure cooker and used about 2-1/2 cups and added about 1 cup of the liquid. I refrigerated it and eat it with crackers or carrots. Thanks for this recipe, it so so delicious!

This is very close to what I have had in Middle Eastern restaurants. I add the 3 Tb of tahini, which gives it a nuttier flavor. Delicious!

Great recipe!  Like other reviewers say, it's a good starting point for hummus.  I make it with extra garlic and homemade tahini (basically, sesame seeds run through the food processor with a little olive oil).

Fresh hummus is so much better tasting than the grocery store stuff! I did a couple of test batches and think the recipe is pretty solid.  Make sure to use fresh squeezed lemon juice, though.  And maybe reserve a little more of the liquid from the bean can, so you can fine tune the consistency you like.

Excellent! Perfect blend of flavors.  I reduced the salt to half a tsp. and increased the garlic to 2 cloves.  I would reduce the fluid, as I prefer a thicker hummus, next time.

Wow!  
This was awesome!  Put it in a little plastic container and just let DH assume it came from the little Lebanese deli down the street.  They make incredible hummus, but it's expensive, esp. compared to the value in this recipe.  Pretty much followed as written in the update, more or less eyeballed stuff then adjusted to taste.  Followed tips by other reviewers: cooked the beans in a pot for about 15 mins., in their own juice plus just a tiny bit of water, then scrubbed/pulled off the outer hulls after they cooled  A pain to be sure, but these two things made for some seriously smooth hummus using my food processor.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe, I just tip the whole contents of the chick peas in the blender, it contains just the right amount of liquid, touch more lemon juice and a touch of white pepper, perfect for us!

The original posted updated to say two garlic cloves are better, so I used two large cloves from a head I just purchased... Way too garlicy! If your garlic isn't fresh or if cloves are smaller, use two. Otherwise, one is probably enough. Otherwise, the mixture is delicious. I will definitely be making many more times in the future!

I have made this twice and have gotten rave reviews for it! It's so easy to make and the best hummus I've ever tasted!  I took some wheat pita bread and toasted it and cut it up to dip into hummus or used cut up veggies to dip into hummus.  Everyone asks for the recipie and i only buy the 38 oz can of garbanzos from now on and double the recipie.  Thank you allrecipies.com!

I love hummus! It's one of those things that I would eat over and over again and definitely would be in my "last dinner" menu. I've tried many from different places and some better than others, but the best one was the one made by a middle eastern family who had a little restaurante in town but had to close and move away. I never eat such as excellent hummus as theirs until I found this recipe. It is just EXCELLENT with the changes made by the author. I have followed the recipe and made hummus for many gatherings and partys and it has been a hit! Thanks a lot for sharing Royhobbs!

I usually make hummus from scratch and just wing it....usually I get overzealous with the tahini and bitterness prevails. This recipe was great! Simple, tasty and a nice consistency. 
  Hummus is ridiculously overpriced in the natural food markets around here and half the time it is flavorless, or too much garlic and a terrible thick mass. To the reviewer that complained about the salt destroying the taste, try a more subtle sea salt, like Himalayan pink. It gives it a nice flavor. Table salt is good for nothing.  I only use organic ingredients which even further ups the flavor. Organic lemon concentrate and tahini from a jar further speeds the process. 15 mins you say? More like 5 mins at most. Great snack. Only downfall is I ate too much and now I need to take a nap. Organic vegetables for dipping are a nice contrast to pita or other breads and if you want to go a little lighter. I used a cuisinart - slapped all the ingredients together - smooth sailing. To the poster of this recipe - many thanks - outstanding! Hemp seed oil drizzled over top is great too. cheers.

Ive been using this as a beginning point for Hummus for years! you may add cilantro to make a different flavor. I also use chipotle chilis with a little of the sauce they come in too. chipotles can be really spicy so be cautious. other times i use cumin for flavor...great healthy meal or dip

Delicious and so easy to make.  I minced 4 cloves of garlic instead of chopping, reduced the salt by half, and added extra bean liquid.  Great with pita bread and a cup of tea.  Hubby likes it too.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a great basic hummus recipe that will leave your tummy singing ... or humming?  I added some roasted red peppers that I had in a jar- just a bit.  No need for the extra teaspoon of salt, either.  The lemon gives enough acid (no relation to the drug although, you may find yourself dizzy and disoriented by how good this hummus is.)

By far the best home made recipe I've found yet.
I did roast  my garlic (2 cloves)  and I roasted red peppers to add an additonal "yum" to this already wonderful recipe.

5 stars for the revised version - definitely no pepper but cumin instead. I prefer less lemon juice but more garlic. This is perfect base for other flavorful mixes, like with fire-roasted peppers, sun-dried tomatoes etc. I make my own Tahini: roasted sesame seeds ground very fine and turned into a paste with olive oil, peanut oil works well too.

As per the original cook suggested, I used cumin and no black pepper and cut the salt in half.  It was still too salty.  I will eliminate the salt next time.

This was pretty good, but the lemon flavor was really strong.  I might cut back by a tablespoon next time.  I added chopped roasted red pepper, which was also good.

Excellent and I also suggest adding/subtracting according to your tastes but this is a great recipe to start. And I must say "Sarah" is taking the title of this  recipe way too  seriously....lighten up. It's a keeper. (personally, my daughter makes the best I've ever tasted but she doesn't measure so this recipe really helped me).And by the way, I did lessen the salt I don't care for pita...so I eat mine WITH A SPOON!! love this stuff!! lol

I made this almost exactly as written. (with the updates) The only difference being that I had lime juice on hand, but no lemons and substituted that in.  Personally I'm not a huge garlic fan, so I will cut back to the original 1 clove when I make this again, but that's just preference.  Great recipe!

I agree with all other reviewers.  This recipes is a 5 star keeper.  I tinker with the salt and tend not to use the oil.  The recipe is just as good without adding the additional calories.  Thanks RoyHobbs for the "real hummus" recipe.

I agree with previous reviewers, this is a great recipe and a perfect starting point! For the budget-minded, tahini is an investment ($8.59 for 16oz at Kroger), but worth it if you eat hummus every week like I do! Beats the store-bought by far.

Excellent.  I left out the salt as my chickpeas were salted.  (I rinsed them off and still did not find the salt necessary.)  I used about half a tablespoon of olive oil in the hummus, reserving another half to drizzle on top.  Otherwise I followed the updated version.  Yum!

CRAZY DELICIOUS!! I didn't have a 19 oz can of chick peas, so instead I used 2 15 oz cans and made a couple adjustments (4 Tbsp lemon juice, 4 Tbsp tahini, 1 tsp salt - since others had mentioned it being too salty I decided to leave the salt measurement as is). I drained and rinsed my beans then just added water while everything was in the blender to get the consistency I wanted. I also removed the skins from the beans beforehand. I know it's not necessary but I thought it might make for a creamier mixture in the end. It was definitely nice and creamy. Absolutely delicious!! So glad I found this one because I've tried other recipes and they were terrible. I will definitely be using this one again and again!!!

Never tasted hummus before.  Sister who loves it came for visit.  Took a while to find tahini.  Made this recipe as printed.  Think I am hook.  Hummus is a real different flavor for an old country boy.

Perfect receipe!  My Egyptian husband makes this the same recipe.  I prefer using dry chick peas & soaking them myself- I just think they are more flavorful than the canned variety.

This is a great hummus recipe with just the right balance of everything. Thanks for sharing! 
This is a great base to work from to customize recipe  to your exact liking, but I found did not need much alteration. For my personal taste, I added a little bit of chopped onion (very small amount), a little more lemon and fresh parsley.

This is possibly the best hummus I've ever had.   I did however take another reviewer's advice and cook my own garbanzo beans to use.  It is excellent!

A very tasty basic hummus.  I prefer a little more variety, so I added some paprika and cayenne.

Deeeeeeeeelicious. I've made it many times now, and it's just about the best hummus I've ever had. The only problem is that after eating it you won't be satisfied with other people's hummus anymore.

This is a great recipe.  Instead of tahini, I pan toasted seasame seeds until lightly brown and blended with a tablespoon of seasame oil.  I also used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and a tablespoon of rice vinegar.  Great results.

This recipe is a great starting point.  As the author noted in his update, I used cumin in place of the pepper (about 3/4t) and I also added about 1/4t cayenne pepper.  I also halved the salt, but added some of the water from the can of chick peas.  I only used 1T of oil and added to the blender along with a little extra water.  The end result is wonderful and I'm sure it will taste even better tomorrow!  Thanks for the easy recipe-- much better (and cheaper) than storebought:)

This turned out to be an unexpectedly delicious hummus despite being very used to the store bought taste. I included the cumin and a small jalapeno, as well as red pepper flakes. So glad I don't have to poison myself with preservatives anymore, thanks!

This is a really good and simple recipe.  There is only one change I make.  Before adding the garbanzo beans to be pureed.  Heat them in water on the stove and rub them together to remove the skins of the beans.  Once all the skins are removed, it makes for an ultra smooth Hummus

Best hummus recipe I've tried. I made it using the updates and it was amazing. Other recipes I've tried have always been a little off, and when I just wing it on my own, I never know how it will turn out. I will definitely be coming back to this one often.

AWESOME!  I halved the lemon juice and it was PERFECT.  If you cannot find the tahini, I don't suggest making it.  I finally found it around the salad condiment area.  Hummus is not the same without it.

Fabulous and simple recipe especially with the updated note to use cumin!  I used canned Garbanzos and refrigerated lemon juice and it was awesome. Next time I will soak dry beans, use real lemon juice, to try the difference.  One MUST use real Tahini...luckily had some.  If you do not see it in the supermarket try the aisle with ethnic foods;  If not there, try the kosher section.  Made a batch that would have cost at least $6 plus for about $2 and better tasting!

I have been using this recipe since I discovered it a year and half ago. It is perfect- though I do change it to taste. I use more Garlic- 3 or 4 cloves - and use the authors recomendation of cumin and less salt. I still only use 2tbsp of tahini, but they are heaping tbsps. I've tried to stray more from the recipe, but when i do it turns out awful. So i always have this recipe in hand when i want to be sure of making Good hummus.

This was my first try at hummus and it turned out pretty well.  I wanted more flavor so I added chopped fresh basil and fresh Italian parsley.  I also doubled the amount of garlic because I love garlic a lot.  It turned out pretty good and tastes best once it it has been refrigerated for at least an hour.

Delicious. Used dried garbanzo beans instead of canned, so had to add water to achieve the desired mushyness, as well as soak and boil the beans beforehand. This is a classic recipe. Made the tahini at home with sesame seeds, too, which is vital to this recipe. Can't believe anyone would use peanut butter. Cumin was also a great tip. Thanks a ton. :)

Using the original subitters changes (2 cloves garlic, 3 Tbs Tahini, 1/2 tsp salt and cumin instead of pepper) this was the BEST hummus I'd ever had!  Try it... you'll never look for another recipe for Hummus again!

This is a great basic recipe, quick, easy and what a money-saver over store-bought hummus. I found the garlic/lemon flavor mellowed overnight. Next time I'll up the tahini and garlic and try out some additional spices.

This is great.  Of course, roasted red bell peppers can be added for a spicy flavor.  I boiled the beans for 20 minutes first, and added filtered water while blending for consistency.  Adding fresh chives is yummy too.

I took the general idea from this recipe and then didn't reference while making it, which was a bad thing. I added way too much garlic. Next time I'll actually follow the recipe.

Tasted like lemon juice. I've never had "real" hummus that tasted like lemon juice.

This is the best hummus recipe I have tried so far.  Since we love garlic, I put more garlic (double the amount) than the recipe called for.  Just perfect.  I was also too lazy to squeeze real lemon so I used a bottled organic lemon juice and it was fine.

Great hummus recipe. I didn't make any changes, and I liked the resulting taste and texture (I used the submitter's suggested changes), and I would make this again and again. Served with "Peppy's Pita Bread" (also awesome).

This over all is a great recipe.  But for those of you who dislike the garbonza beans and their texture.  I use Canaleni (white kidney) beans in mine and it's sooo good!!

Easy but bland.  Would prefer more garlic (as a personal preference).  Also, recipe says to reserve juice from beans but never tells to add it back it (I did to smooth it out more).

So easy and remarkably similar to professional grade hummus! I had no idea I could make the store bought stuff so well and cheaply. I was worried my lack of a food processor would complicate the recipe, but my blender worked great for this. I would stick with 2 Tbs of tahini and adjust garlic and lemon to taste. (The tahini is bitter and too much can be unpleasant.) Use olive oil if it needs more creaminess.

Awesome and so easy!  I hated to spend so much on tahini, but it was well worth it and pays for itself once you've made this a couple of times. I used 2 tsp crushed garlic, 3.5 Tbl lemon juice, 1/3 cup bean juice, 1/4 tsp kosher salt, 3 Tbl tahini.

Perfect and extremely simple. I stuck a huge whisk in my jar of tahina to get it going, that was the most difficult. Threw everything in the processor, turned it on, salt and pepper to taste, super simple.

Really tasty!  Followed the suggestion by the author to up the tahini...next time I am going to add it more slowly, 3Tbsp is a lot!  Only added a dash of salt and left out the pepper entirely.  This recipe seems like it would be a great base to build from, it could easily be adapted to whatever flavor you like!

this is a fail-safe recipe for hummus.  i have tried before mulitple times, but was using dry garbonzo beans instead.t   even after soaking and boiling them, i just couldn't get the right consitancy of hummus. canned garbanzo beans are the answer....also...i would reccomend using a food proccessor instead of blender if you have one....it makes the job much easier

Definately a hit at my house! I added a pinch of cumin and added the olive oil while I was blending. I used 2 cloves of garlic and thought it was a little too much for my tastes but the kids gobbled it up! I thought the salt was a little too much too. Next time I'll use less sea salt and one clove of garlic but that's just altering it to my tastes. This is a fantastic recipe!

This was very good, I used 3 cloves of garlic because that's how my family eats.  Next time I would not use so much of the bean liquid, it was a little runny for our taste.  But very good, I'll definitely make in the future.

This was excellent. This is what hummus from my local middle eastern restaurant tastes like. After I made this by the recipe, I tasted it, and then I added some roasted red pepper to it.  It tasted great both ways.

This is a very good and easy hummus recipe.  The only thing I changed was reducing the lemon juice to 1/2 teaspoon because I don't like a strong lemon flavor.  The addition of cumin instead of black pepper makes it taste incredibly good.

Wow!  I'll never buy it in the jar again.  I followed the recipe according to the updated version of the original poster.  I love the flavor of the cumin.  I don't drizzle the olive oil either as I think it's wonderful as is.  My brother will be bugging me to make him more.  Great recipe!!  I'm going to try adding some roasted red pepper next time.

This recipe was really easy to make and the seasonings were just right.  I left all the liquid from the can of chick peas so it ended up really thin but I like it this way.   I like the fact that this is a lower fat version of hummus and the taste is great.

This turned out well the first time I made it, but not in the subsequent tries. It tasted good, but the consistency was too watery.

I thought this recipe was too garlicky and lemony. I cut back on those two ingredients and it makes a great veggie dip. Thanks for the recipe - it's so much cheaper to make it than to buy it!

Great recipe.  Our kids love the Costco commercial (in Ottawa) version, so we modified it to mimic that version:

1 clove of garlic instead of 2
We also use juice from the can for liquid
4 tablespoons of lemon juice
4 tablespoons of tahini instead of 3
1/2 salt
pepper
2 tablespoons of canola oil (not olive - canola is more flavorless)
1 tablespoon of vinegar (commercial stuff has it as an ingredient and it does make a difference).

This was delicious! I could not stop eating it! Perfect with pita chips. We made according to recipe and then added some sun dried tomatos we had on hand. Drizzled top with olive oil and sprinkled paprika on the top for presentation.

Well done. The critique from my guests was that it was a bit on the tart side. Perhaps lessen the lemon juice just a touch? Still, an excellent, authentic tasting entree'.

This recipe is a good guideline to follow.  I used 2 TBS of Tahini and it was too much to my liking.  I also used 4 cloves of garlic and added italian parsley.  I added salt to taste.  Very good.

This didn't have enough oompff for me. All I tasted was the garbanzo beans - so I doubled the tahini and the lemon juice. I don't ever use canned beans I use dried beans which I have cooked and soaked, this is the first time I didn't think they translated well into a recipe. I am going to add fresh parsely to the leftovers and serve as a spread on an olive sandwich.

I have been looking for tahini for months and finally found some. I made this recipe last night and it was delicious! I followed the author's updates version, and the only change I made was to use garlic I had roasted a few nights ago and wanted to use up, instead of raw garlic. Wonderful! Thank you.

I thought that this had a good traditional hummus taste. I used the author's updated version to include cumin instead of pepper.

This is perfect with cumin instead of black pepper, and less salt. I have a salt tooth but I have to say the salt overwhelmed the other flavours. Use half the amount and it'll be perfect. Let it sit overnight for the flavours to develop. If you want the colour to be more appetising for non-hummus fans, add paprika while processing, or serve topped with olive oil and sprinkle with paprika.

This Hummus was amazing!  The best Hummus I have ever made.  I followed the recipe update review instructions and added a lot more garlic.  Will make this one again.

This is so good and very easy.  I made Peppy's pita bread from this site and made hummus sandwiches for lunch.  Will definitely make again and again.  I increased the lemon juice to 5 1/2 TBSP and the tihini to 2 1/2 TBSP and blended in the olive oil.

Amazing!  I made this for a party I had, so i doubled the recipe, and it was all gone by the end of the night!!  I used the juice of 3 lemons total, A LOT of fresh garlic, and then garlic powder and cumin to season after blended.  i blended everything but the chickpeas first including the oil, and 3/4 of the liquid from the beans cans.  i set it in the fridge overnight, and it settled very well.  use less liquid if you want to eat it sooner, but i recommend refrigerating it overnight.

delicious! i'm never buying store hummus again!

I've made this many times.  The ratio of ingredients is just how I like it.  I use a little less salt, but I tend to do that in everything I make.  (I tried it without salt entirely, and it's definitely better with it.)  I also like that this recipe doesn't make a ton.  I'm the only one in the house that eats it, so it's perfect.

Fabulous and easy to modify. I really recommend Kosher salt, with a larger grain and better taste than table salt. Didn't try the cumin, but I'm sure it would also be great with other variations as well.

I never realised how easy it was to make hummus. When I tasted this directly after making I too thought it was a bit salty. But by the time I served it at my party the following day it had lost that salty taste. Many Thanks.

this is a great, easy, healthy snack! I don't even worry so much now about measuring exactly but just getting the proportions approximate, and it turns out yummy everytime.  chick peas, garlic, lemon juice and tahini, what a great combination!  and we eat them with salted tortilla chips since that's usually what we have on hand.

I made this last Sunday for the football game and had cut up veggies and whole wheat pita bread cut into triangles with it.  It was awesome!  At first bite the tahini made the Hummus taste almost peanutty, or nutty but after a little while the flavors blended more nicely and it was perfect.  I think I will add more garlic and maybe a tad more lemon next time.  Mine turned out a perfect consistency done as the recipe states.  This beats any store bought variety by far!

Yummy! Very creamy, with a more lemony flavor than other hummus recipes I've tried.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding a teaspoon of cumin. That's just my personal taste, and I think it would still be delicious without it.

Thanks for the recipe!

A little too much lemon for my tastes. And I only put in 3 Tbsp. I'd recommend adding the lemon to taste. Other than that, it is a very good recipe.

This is such a great base for learning how to make hummus. I tried a different recipe that I think is closer to not only a more traditional hummus but it also has more live enzymes (so its better for you). BUT this one is great to start with. I'm going to add more garlic next time :)

I had a terrible time trying to make my own tahini for this, but otherwise it was very good.  I blenderized and added two or three roasted red pepper slices for flavor and they added something really great :)

I felt it was time to surprise my tastebuds and try this recipe. I made it this afternoon and I thought the flavors were simply wonderful! I followed the suggestions of the author, and used 2 whole garlic cloves but I personally felt the garlic had a strong, spicy bite to it. I will use 1 clove next time. I would also follow the advice of another review to use the juice of 1 lemon as the lemon flavor was slightly distracting as opposed to complimenting. It's a game of balancing the unique flavors to suit your taste I suppose. Ive never had humous before, but I will most definitely keep this recipe in my recipe box. Oh, and I too, only drizzled 1 tbs. of extra virgin olive oil and lightly sprinkled some ground cumin. I lighly toasted some pita bread on a dry skillet and dove in. I'm hooked! Thanks for sharing!

Delicous! Made this yesterday morning with Peppy's Pita Bread also from this site and it was yummed up during a game of poker with my friends. Got rave reviews from everyone there. I didn't have lemon juice on hand so I substitued with lime juice, gave a little different tang but still worked. Next time I will make sure to have lemon juice.  Definitely five star worthy!

I used the extra information provided by the recipe submitter and had wonderful results. In the past I have found that the lemon juice can be too strong for my palate and in this case I used the juice of one whole lemon and found that to be quite enough. Very nice standard recipe.

This was just ok.  I made it twice, the first time I followed directions exactly and 4 tablespoons lemon juice (used fresh-squeezed) is way too much.  It tasted more like a ‘lemon dip’ than anything else.  The second time it tasted a lot better but still seems its lacking something.  It is a good recipe though; it’s a matter of personal taste and tweaking it to your liking.

This was a great recipe. I read the reviews, and followed the updated recipe by the original author.  It turned out great, although it was just a tiny bit gritty after being processed. I will just make my own homemade beans next time, instead of using canned to avoid that. The only changes I made was to use a little bit less salt and lemon juice. I used the juice of a half lemon, and about 1/4 tsp salt and approx. 4 tbsp Tahini. I can't imagine this tasting authentic with peanut butter. My bf and I ate it with some pita bread I grilled with olive oil and it was awesome. It will be a new staple in our home. Thank you for the easy, affordable, delicious recipe!!

I'm very new to hummus in general and this was my first attempt at making it (previously bought in store). If you have a hard time finding tahini (I did) try an organic market. Thats where I found mine. I added an extra clove of garlic, avacado (had to use some up) and omitted the olive oil (because I plain forgot about it). Turned out great! Would reccommend.

hmmmm....very good. I followed the updated changes and it came out fabulous! It's great on half a bagel with a bit of cheddar cheese on the top! One note-I am a garlic lover, however, I think next time I will use just one clove, it was a bit too much for my stomach.

I got SO many praises about this Hummus yesterday (Christmas 2006)!!! I served this to my aunt and her date who ADORE greek food, and they couldn't get enough! I added ground cayenne pepper and black pepper to taste and it was great. I served it with pita wedges and red and green bell pepper chunks for dipping. Will be making again and again, especially for my 13 year old. Thanks!

I'm hoping that this will taste really great tomorrow, since Hummus does have a tendency to be better the next day.  Its missing something, and I'm not sure what it is.  I followed the recipe precisely, and cut down on the salt as suggested.  I like my hummus tangy, and this isn't, even with all the lemon juice.

Very good! I also added a little onion, some cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, cumin, cilantro, parsley, & chives.  Next time I'll probably toss in some roasted red pepper too.

This recipe was pretty good.  I added 2 15oz cans of garbanzo beans since I couldn't find a 19oz can.  I left everything else the same except I added an extra clove of garlic.  I should have used 1 clove because it was a little strong.  The hummus did taste better after being in the refrigerator for a few days.

A good, solid hummus recipe. I made it just as directed and it was delicious. It did not have as much garlic or lemon as other recipes I have tried so it was less pungent--the flavors were definitely more subtle. If you like the overwhelming garlic that is traditionally associated with hummus, you may want to increase it. However, if you prefer the milder varieties, this one is perfect!

I replaced the salt with just a dash of basil and added an extra clove of garlic and it was delicious.  It's really great used as a dip for raw vegetables, especially carrots and celery.

Like others have suggested, I prefer less salt and a little more garlic.  But this is the best and easiest hummus recipe I have found.

This is so good.  Easy to make too!!  The only thing i changed was adding a clove more garlic(personal addiction to garlic) and instead of oil I added plain fat free yogurt, which gives it a really creamy texture.  To all of you out there with no food processers, a hand stick blender worked very well for me. :)

This is a beautiful, simple, and authentic hummus recipe... the best that I have tried to date!  As a matter of personal taste, I added a 1/2 tsp of ground coriander seed to boost the lemon-iness.

I didn't have any Tahini (and it was really expensive at the grocery store!) so I swapped in peanut butter, and although a slightly different taste it was still a good recipe.

I did use dry garbanzos made in an instant pot instead of a can, but that doesn't make much difference.

I tried this recipe twice, first time was too salty but still tasty.  Second time I reduced the salt but used a lesser quality tahini.  So my advice would be to use a good tahini and go light on the salt.

Made it today and it was delicious. Like most people who review, I tweaked it according to taste by adding some freshly roasted red pepper into the mix/blender and also as a topping.  I used the red tinted  olive oil from the pan that I roasted the peppers in on top of the mixture I then also added a dash of cayenne pepper to the recipe and sprinkled a bit around the edges . My daughter, a huge NYC foodie, ate it with gusto and announced that this was actually the very best hummus she has ever tasted, including from the foreign countries she's visited. I myself am very happy with the result and will be making frequently.

It certainly was delicious but it came out too watery when I added the specified amount of liquid from the can.  Unfortunately I only had one can of chick peas and had no way to go back and thicken it up.  I must say that I don’t much care for the use of liquid from the can.  I have another recipe that calls for olive oil and and cumin that I like much better.   Nevertheless,  if you don’t have olive oil, or prefer a lower fat version, this recipe is great. And like I’ve said, it’s delicious.  Just make sure to add the liquid slowly to get the right consistency.

I made this because I really love hummus. Since I didn't have tahini I used creamy peanut butter instead. I also roasted my garlic and mixed it into the hummus instead of just putting it on the top with the olive oil, which I also mixed directly into the hummus. Will make again.

Nice basic recipe; but check the liquid I only needed a couple tablespoons. My add-ins were a big chunk of roasted red bell pepper and another 4 ROASTED garlic cloves.

I also found garlic equal to 2 medium sized cloves is a good amount.  I skip the salt and pepper and use basil, cumin and turmeric instead.  I replace the Tahini with 1 Tbsp sesame seeds (lightly toasted) and 11/2 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The result is a hummus that is better than what I can buy locally.  You can increase or decrease the amount you get buy varying the size of the can of beans that you use.

Followed the updated recipe and it tastes great! Makes quite a bit of hummus! Cheaper than buying hummus at the store and tastes better! Store it in a bowl with lid and it should last a while! I accidentally drained all of the liquid from the can but wanted it creamy so I just added a bit of water into the blender. Worked great! You can add your favorite herb to the mixture as well!

Excellent recipe and so incredibly easy to make.  I'm cutting calories so I didn't even use the olive oil and it still tasted much better than store-bought.

I made this as the recipe calls the first time. It was excellent. Next time I amped up the garlic and tahini. Great receipt.

Exceptional with some modifications. I modified to 4 cloves garlic, 4 tbsp tahini, and 1/4 tsp cumin; no black pepper. I cut back the lemon juice to 3 tbsp and salt to 1/4 tsp.  With regards the method, I didn’t add in the reserved liquid until last and then added it in slowly until I got the consistency I wanted. I ended up using about 1/4 of the reserved liquid instead of 1/2.

Delicious! I substituted pepper for cumin, slightly on the salty side. I would add a little less. Also, added cayenne and a drop of “Da bomb sauce” for spicy. Will definitely make it again!

I thought this was delicious! I followed the recipe with the author's update. I didn't have fresh garlic, so used the chopped jarred type. I also cut the lemon juice in half. So easy and yummy, I will be making this again!

Very good base. I made two different batches.  Didn’t have a 19 oz can so used 1 1/2 cup of garbanzo beans per batch, maybe a little less for batch 2 and substituting cumin instead of pepper on both batches and added red pepper flakes (1tsp) and half tsp cayenne pepper to the second batch just to add some spice. I only added one tbsp of reserved juice just to add some moisture on the first batch but none on the second

I added a little extra lemon juice because I like the extra WOW factor, and a little more tahini to smooth it out. This recipe is great for basic hummus. I found if you add anything like roasted red peppers or black olives, you need to reduce the amount of juice you add to the base. Otherwise, it is awesome. I'll use it again.

I took the author’s advice and added cumin, I forgot the salt and put 3 tablespoons of tahini and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice.  It was so good!!  I’ll never buy hummus from the store again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made it following the authors revised recipe the only changes I made: i used slightly less than a half cup of liquid, I used 1/4 tsp salt and I didn’t pour oil on top of it (it’s delicious without). great recipe I will reuse this to dip with vegetables.

What a great basic recipe ! I changed the ratio up a bit because I like more tahini and garlic. I also added roasted red pepper (Mezzetta's) because I like the flavor. It was delicious! I'll never store buy it again...from now on it's homemade! Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious. I made my own tahini with 1/2 cup roasted sesame seeds toasted in a cast iron pan on the stove top, put in mini food processor, then add a little more than 1/8 cup olive oil. I also used dried chickpeas, soaked overnight, then boiled and simmered for 90 minutes. 19 oz is about 2 1/2 cups cooked. I used the liquid from cooking the chickpeas. I love the taste of fresh garlic and lemon juice and omitted the olive oil because it was already in the tahini. I like my hummus a little firmer with lots of garlic so I made it that way and this is delicious. I made whole wheat pitas too but they didn't turn out quite as well but together, yum.

I finished making a red pepper hummus, and found this recipe to use the rest of the beans that I had cooked the day before.  After tasting I thought.... this could use a little Cumin.  I went to Reviews and found the author's update, which I thought amusing - I never read reviews first, but now I will.  Great recipe !!

Very good. Original recipe was a bit too bland for my tastebuds, so made my own modifications: added more beans for thicker consistency; added more garlic cloves (garlic lover here); added a little extra lemon juice; added a little extra salt; added a bit of cumin; added a bit of paprika in the mixture and on top as garnish; and added a bit of olive oil to the mixture, as well as a little on top for garnish as directed in the recipe. Eating a little right now with pita.

Back in the day we could find Progresso chic peas in the 19 ounce can. Now I cook organic dried chic peas in the pressure cooker and use a healthy two cups. A friend asked for my recipe and this one is spot on with his updates of garlic and cumin. Why buy that yukky manufactured stuff when you can make this at home and organic even?! When I've been out of tahini I just grind up lightly toasted sesame seeds.

Delicious, easy, and much tastier than store-bought.  Based on previous reviews, I started with half the amount of salt and half the amount of lemon juice.  The salt was perfect at half, but the lemon juice was still very strong.  I think next time I'll start with 1/4 of the amount of lemon juice and add to taste.

The recipe itself was a good basic hummus recipe, but as others said, the salt amount was totally wrong.  I ended up having to add another can of garbanzo beans and double the other ingredients to absorb the excess salt.  I would only use about an 1/8 teaspoon of salt to this recipe.

It was a bit salty.  Not sure why.  However I added a few dried cherries, raisins, re-hydrated porcini,  a dash of cumin and coriander, pinch of sugar.  A Syrian-born friend of mine from Tel Aviv loved it.  Hummus is in his blood.

I used 1 1/2 cups of home-prepared garbanzo beans which I soaked over night with and water vinegar, then cooked in the crock pot. I used 3 Tbl  of lime juice, 2 garlic cloves (sautéed in some olive oil) and 1 1/2 Tbls of tahini. Loved the results.

Really nice simple recipe. I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and used 3 garlic cloves. Great quick snack if you happen to have all the ingredients around.

Turned out really good. The next time I made it I doubled the garlic, used only 4 tablespoons of lemon juice and skipped the pepper. I did put some paprika on the top.

Not enough garlic, so I added some. Just made it again - with even more.

A trick I heard to make it creamier is to add yoghurt.  Another trick is to sprinkle paprika on top along with the olive oil. Both of  which I will try next time

Great basic recipe. After reading many helpful reviews I opted to make a couple of changes for personal preference. I omit the salt entirely and use low sodium garbonzo beans. The reason I make my own hummus is partly due to sodium issues. The other reasons are it's so easy and delicious! 
The other addition is cumin. I love how the cumin gives the hummus just a little extra flavor. 
That's the beauty of this recipe, flavor can be added to suit individual tastes. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great, simple recipe!  I added another can of garbanzo beans (no liquid) and an extra clone of garlic. Add even more ground pepper to give it a kick. Delicious! Plus, takes 5 mins to make and clean up. Win win!

I used my VitaMix to make this hummus. The texture was super smooth. Seasoning was right on. I love any hummus, but this recipe is worth keeping. No picture, because we ate it all before I could snap one.

Definitely cut the salt in half or less. 1 tsp is a lot!! Would recommend trying without the juice from the can of garbanzo beans and use more olive oil and lemon juice to make it creamy. You may have to add not lemon juice depending on how tart your lemons are.

Thankfully I know how to cook well. Although this recipe is delish, I made sure I bought “unsalted” Tahini and used only ½ the salt of the recipe. I saw the update but it does not reflect in the actual recipe here.

I second the changes the author made (more tahini, less salt). I also used sesame oil instead of olive oil and I used minced garlic (1TBSP...I love garlic!). I even added some sun-dried tomato purée into this batch! Yum!

I attempted to make this recipe as written, but found it to be extremely tart due to the 4 tbls of fresh lemon juice. This forced me to add ingredients to get the flavor right. Will find another for my next round of hummus making.

Great ratios great flavor. Used fresh squeezed lemon, mixed in olive oil instead of garbonzo can juice, 2 minced garlic, dash of cumin into mix and garnish.   I make this all the time. Dash of Chipotle powder is nice depth and slight kick of spice!

The first time I followed the instructions.  It stuck well to carrot sticks, although I thought it was a little on the runny side.  The second time I drained all the liquid from the beans and the consistency was much more to my liking.

I adore this recipe. I did put in one less tablespoon of olive oil and less lemon juice but otherwise followed the recipe. I could’ve eaten it all in one sitting it was so tasty. I’ll be making this again soon.

This recipe is great. I was looking for a recipe to imitate a lemony hummus I had at my favorite wine bar. As is, I give it 4 stars. I tasted and added some chopped flat leaf parsley and in my opinion that was the little thing that was missing. I also added the fresh ground black pepper and olive oil to the blender and then topped with more for garnish. Yum!

I didn't reserve any of the chickpeas for garnish, because I'm by myself and I don't care how it looks.  However, I did sprinkle some smoked paprika over the top of it which made it pretty and enhanced the flavor a little.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I found it to be a little bland.  I am from SE Louisiana, so I really like food that is rich with flavor...not to be confused with spicy.  I added a teaspoon of cumin and an ingredient that is local but can be gotten on their website.  It's called Magic  Swamp Dust and it's from a company called Creative Cajun Cooking.  A tablespoon of that to this quantity made it absolutely PERFECT!  Look it up and give it a try!  You will get hooked and start using Dust on virtually EVERYTHING!!!  I do.  Oh, and to the person who said this was a disaster:  You're clearly not doing it right.  You can get tahini online or at some of your more major local grocers and Albertson's carries it.  I wish Wal-mart would, though.

1 raw garlic is fine, try using roasted garlic.  Drain almost all liquid from beans.  Try cumin, or curry, or garam masala.

This is a simple, easy-to-make recipie. I agree with the author that cumin works better than pepper, although I like the pepper too. Cut back on the salt, add a dash more lemon juice and this hummus is creamy and smooth.

Made it as is with 3 exceptions... 1.) Only had a 15.5 oz can of garbanzos.  2.)  I added some roasted garlic powder for more garlicky flavor and 3.) I blended the tahini with the lemon juice first, as another off-site recipe stated this was key to a great hummus.   It was very good... But a bit on the thin side (probably due to less beans! Not recipe's fault!)  Next time I will add less liquid but keep everything else the same.  My grandma said it was really tasty.

Easy tip... If you find your tahini has separated, simply scrape it all into the processor before anything else and blend it all up, then pour or spoon it back into the jar.  Voila!  Correct consistency!

I wish I would have blended it longer. I think it's a good recipe, but it's true that you need to test and add. I wish I would have reserved more of the water in the can because mine came out a little thick. Wish I would have seen the update from ROYHOBBS before making it.

I would use half of the lemon juice called for, a little too tangy.  Also, I only use 1 clove of garlic, but I see from the recipe update it should be 2. I'm going to roast the garlic first so it's not so harsh.

Ding! Ding! Ding! Winner! Thanks, RoyHobbs. I've been making this for several years now, since it was one of the very few healthy, vegetarian tings my late husband would eat cheerfully. The only alteration I made was to reduce the lemon juice to 2-1/2 to 3 tablespoons, depending on how sour my lemons are. Thanks again.

The garlic and lemon flavor were way too strong and the salt was overbearing. I would suggest you not add as many extra ingredients with less salt and just add a tiny bit of lemon if any.

It was fine!   I added the sun-dried tomato and an extra pinch of cayenne because we like the heat.  A very tasty, simple recipe!

I'm currently on a hummus "kick" and found this recipe after being directed to this website by a friend who sent me a link to a soup recipe he'd made. 

With the exception of different spices and garnishes, this is a pretty basic recipe for hummus.  Yes...hummus.  The name is not appropriate since I've never heard of "fake" hummus and suggest that it be named "Traditional Hummus".  

The ingredient listed as "garbanzo beans" is not  one which is used generally in Canada and had to google it.  We know it as chick peas, whether in a can or dried in a package. 

I tend to follow recipes by the book but was confused by the listing of "1 clove garlic" and then in the next column, "1 clove garlic, chopped".  The recipe instructions imply the use of only one clove.  I noticed in the comments that the author as changed it up as far as the amount of garlic goes, but this isn't reflected in the recipe.  ROYHOBBS; can you not edit your own recipe or give variations?  Not everyone reads the reviews and would miss your changes to the recipe. 

By the way, I had no problem finding tahini in several of the chain grocery stores but will compare the price with that of the international groceries.  We have a large Middle Eastern population in my area so ingredients such as tahini are now mainstream where at one time was harder to find.

Made as is. Very good, wouldn't change a thing. 
I do prefer using organic beans, the taste is much better.

Good solid basic hummus recipe. I went heavier on the garlic and added a bit of cumin. I like this recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

Aside from using almond butter rather than tahini, I make this per the recipe, and I love it, I have made it several times and have always been happy with the result.

I followed the recipe with the changes from the chef found in the reviews. It is so easy and very good. I was shy on the cumin at the beginning so I added some until I liked the strength. Also, the can of beans I used was only 16 oz. so I used a bit less olive oil and reserve from the can. This recipe is excellent. I can't wait to serve it tomorrow at my book club.

AMAZING recipie! As I didn't have Tahimi I made it myself with sesame seeds and a little bit of olive oil in the minipimer. And then made the Hummus. 
I only used 1/3 of the juice from the can, so it turned out with more consistency. Delicious! And a little bit spicy thanks to the garlic (I left the heart of the garlic). If you don't like it as spicy I would recommend to take the heart of the garlic. 
Thank you!

Great base!  Made one batch plain and upped the garlic, added one chipotle pepper and a bit of adobo sauce to the second batch, and the third added a little adobo sauce, a hot pepper with lime spice mix and a touch of cumin.  Family loved and daughter absconded with chipotle batch!  This was so easy I don't know why I ever bought this prepared!  Thanks.

I can't really improve on this by much.  I had whole cumin which I roasted in the oven on a lightly oiled sheet (or one can use a skillet-as soon as you smell it it's done and about to burn, so keep an eye on it) and crushed them with the back of a spoon for some extra aromatic joy. I also used fresh picked flat leaf parsley from my ledge potted garden for a garnish.  Fantastic.  The two garlic addition methods works great for layering in the garlic flavor, and I don't feel it's too garlick-y at all, in fact, if I'm in the mood for something strong I might add an extra clove. I never had a problem with salt, but i must admit that I almost always "measure" salt by eye in my hand and tend towards the light side because you can always add more. When using canned/jarred products you have to look at the ingredients and if salt is added you're going to have account for it. I found this recipe, pre update, was just fine, though my neighbor had some and then he kept bringing me garbanzo beans and asking me to make it for him until he finally got a blender and I gave him the recipe. No, peanut butter is not even a little bit like tahIn, and be careful of a mixed product called "tahini sauce" which they sell at TJ's. It will work, but not as well, and also calls for adjustments to other ingredients. My tahIn is a brand called Tuna, is from Turkey and is seseme paste and nothing else. You have to mix it well before adding. 
Taste and adjust to your own preference- this is more like free

Delicious, easy, and healthy! I made it once with a teaspoon of salt and once with a half- teaspoon of salt and I prefer it with the half- teaspoon. It gets a little thicker after it's been refrigerated. For simplicity, you can omit the olive oil and the reserved chickpeas on top if you wish.

I followed the updates by the author of this recipes. WOW! I will never buy commercial brands again. The best tahini is Trader Joe's. It is in a flat round container similar to sour cream. Not easy to find so ask for it from store personnel.

We make this all the time! So easy and yummy.  The trick really is keeping the liquid from the chick pea can to add for creaminess.  We like it smooth!

I made this once using the recommended 19oz of beans , and the second time with a typical 15.5 oz can of beans. I definitely prefer the second batch, the flavors were brighter.

This was pretty good. Easy to put together, I added a bit more olive oil. I will try cumin next time, sounds very good, I did add some smoked paprika for color and flavor.

Needs about 0-50% of the salt, but good.  I didn't use the pepper but could see where cumin would be good.

So good.  The Tahini paste is really good. This is a great recipe to adjust to your liking , more or less lemon, more or less garlic, more or less salt.  I live on the south side of Chicago and we have a large Middle Eastern population here - this recipe rivals the many Mediterranean restaurants we have nearby.

This is a super yummy base but it's very plain. Added some salsa, Tabasco sauce,  & Chipotle Chili Spice to kick up the heat.

The Tahini makes this so much more interestin.  I used 2 garlic not 1 which seems about right.  I used full 1/3 cup olive oil just to make it smoother and not so granular from dryness and cut the salt to 1/2 - 2/3 teaspoons.  Now I have to try and not eat it all in one night.

I love this recipe but had to adjust it for flavor.  I use the cumin instead of pepper and I use only 1 tablespoon of tahini..  I use less salt and toast my pita bread when I serve it!

Overall, this recipe is really good.  I agree with the author's comment to use cumin instead of pepper.  I use a whole teaspoon.  I also add cayenne pepper to give it a kick.  However, 4 tablespoons of lemon juice is way too much.  I cut it down to 2.

I loved this! I don't always like store bought hummus, and this recipe was really good. Made the adjustments the author of the recipe suggested. After chilling, it was perfect. The garlic flavour is a bit strong though so I might cut it back to one clove next time. This yields more than I thought so I will have hummus all week!

Very creamy and tasted great.  I liked this recipe because it used less tahini and olive oil than most other recopies I've found.  Easy to make.  I used our blender and it came out super smooth. 
 I did not add cumin and I used Himalayan salt.  1 tsp probably would have been enough for me, but my family is just now coming off salt use--so to them it seemed just right.

It looked good, great texture but way waaaaay too salty, sorry... I should had read your update review ...besides I purchased those bagged nabisco Pita chips which turned out to be super salty too...  I will try it again, but with no salt, and will start adding salt gradually and taste it until it is fine.

Fantastic recipe and very easy to make!  

I reserved all of the liquid and then slowly added it back to the thickness I prefer and added a little jalapeño to spice it up.

Better than any store bought!

The only change I made was to add another clove of garlic, nor did I use any reserve liquid from the can of beans.  I slowly drizzled the olive oil while the food processor was blending, until I reached the desired consistency. This recipe is definitely the one I'll be using going forward! Thanks Roy Hobbs!

I add 1/2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp sesame oil when I make the recipe. It is a very good recipe that I have made many times. It is better than any premade hummus that I have tasted. With the additions of the cumin and sesame seed oil it is a 5 star recipe.

This is my hummus recipe.  Usually use a small processor & perfect.  Today used a blender...very smooth, but a tad thin.  Like it a bit thicker, but love it.  Don't have pita today, but triscuits, carrots or cherry tomatoes will do!  Family loves it & haven't bought hummus in the grocery for years.  Thank-you Roy Hobbs!!!

Added 3T tahini, 2 garlic, only 2T lemon, and put about 2T liquid into the mixture and all of the olive oil before mixing together in the food processor. EXCEPTIONALLY good on my bagel and quick to make.

I followed the suggestion to use 3 T tahini and should have tasted it first with 2 before adding the other tablespoon.  It had to much tahini for my taste.  I added a little garlic powder for more garlicky taste.  Good idea when making hummus, start with smaller amounts of garlic, lemon, tahini, taste and add to your own liking.  I stared making my own when we moved from Ohio 7 yrs ago because the Beirut in Toledo makes the best hummus ever and never found any to compare.

I doubled the garlic, used half the amount of Lemon juice (4TBS was a bit strong) and I wanted a Mediterranean hummus so I added 1/4 each of dried parsley, oregano and lemon thyme. Also reserve the juice from the beans on the side if you need more liquid or you could end up with runny hummus. This was a great classic hummus

So convenient to make anytime, rather then having to buy the pre-made at the store.  All the ingredients are usually staples that I have all the time.  I add parsley and hot peppers. Today, I added sun-dried tomatoes too.  Also, a great snack to make real quick to go along with crackers for an outing.

Great recipe, easy and delicious. I made it nearly exactly as the updated version suggested, with more tahini and less salt, and with cumin, although I did add a dash of pepper too, because I love pepper. I think using good garbanzo beans makes a big difference--I like the kind that comes in cartons instead of cans. 
Thank you to the recipe author!

Excellent recipe. Only change I made was to stir in the olive oil at the end and to lightly dust with ground paprika instead of the black pepper - looks very pretty.  Next time I will crush the garlic with a press or a pestle & mortar before adding to the processor, as it was a little too chunky for my family's preferences. Looking forward to experimenting with flavours.

The revised edition of this recipe was a great base to which many things could be added if you want to be creative and don't mind it being less tradition (a swirl of roasted red peppers, or cilantro and lime instead of lemon, etc). I read elsewhere to mix the tahini and lemon juice for a minute or longer first for best consistency, and I think this makes a big difference (from smooth hummus recipe from inspiredtaste.net). Also, I rinse the beans and use low sodium broth instead of liquid from the can to lower sodium content. This recipe is delicious, simple, and cost effective. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty - the right mix of tahini and lemon juice (another recipe I had tried had way too much tahini). As suggested by the author in an update, I used cumin instead of pepper and loved it

Love it. I didn't have Lemon juice, so I put 2 tablespoons of Lime juice and a tsp of Lemon Pepper. Oh YUM!!!
I never have tahini so I use the powdered peanut butter and the amazing taste ????????????

The revision is spot-on! We love this-so much better than chip dip. Only addition is we sprinkle some cayenne on top with the cumin.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was using the bagged garbanzo beans (instead of canned) and  presoaked and cooked for 2 hours. I will definitely use this as a base for different variations of hummus. Super Easy!

I tried the recipe because I had gotten addicted to the hummus at the grocery store, and this didn't taste very similar to that or as good.  I usually expect homemade recipes to taste better than store-bought, so that was a big disappointment.  I tried again, thinking maybe if I tried some variations from the comments, it would be better.  I think cooking the chick peas first created a much smoother consistency, but it still didn't compare with store-bought hummus.

Wow, this is a keeper! I did take the advice of other reviewers and used 3 tblps of tahini and it was great! I didn't need more than that really. I also used two large cloves of garlic and added half teaspoon cumin. It was delicious! I realized that good olive oil makes this dish as well, so that's important to keep in mind! Thanks for the recipe!!

This turned out great!  I added an extra clove of garlic just because we are garlic-crazy, and it tastes great.  I always use fresh squeezed lemon too.

Great recipe. I make it at least once a month and put it in my kids' and husband's lunches along with pita chips or carrot sticks. I don't bother with the garnish unless I'm serving it at home. I find the recipe to be very forgiving and don't take the time to measure if I'm rushed. It tastes better than what I have purchased at the store and is a whole lot cheaper to make than it is to buy.

It was severly underseasoned. I used the juice and zest from an entire lemon before i was satisfied. I also added sage and paprika to make it more interesting. I would absolutely reccomend upping lemon measurements.

This was a very easy, with a few modifications.  I used my immersion blender rather than a blender.  Easier clean up, and I added a bit of pepper chopped up for more interest.  Everyone loved it with fresh veggies.

I'd recommend useing about 1/3 to 1/4 of the salt this recipe calls for... or even omit it entirely. I had to add a whole additional can of chickpeas just to make it palatable.

Made as above and loved it. Had to try something on my second batch, could not find my tahini so I had picked up a packet of chestnuts on a lark. Started with those and came up with a whole different dish.

My first try at homemade hummus was challenging but successful. I used 2 15 oz cans of chickpeas and substituted Key Lime juice. Since using more chickpeas, I gradually added additional ingredients has I blended. Omitted the pepper and added Cumin to taste.  Very Tastey!

Made for my class - they loved it. Also made a variation w/ roasted red peppers, blending half the peppers into the hummus and chopped the rest up as texture/extra flavor. Also I added more tahini than called for. Warning - do not shake your can of tahini no matter how separated it is. Just get equal parts solid and liquid and add them to your food processor.

First time making hummus! This turned out great! I used about 3-4 Tablespoons of liquid from the can and 1 Tablespoon of olive oil, otherwise followed the recipe as written. Looking forward to trying more hummus recipes on here.

Delicious, perfect recipe.  I love this hummus as is, but I occasionally mix it up with different add-in like roasted red bell peppers, extra garlic or whatever sounds good that day.  Very easy to modify to your own liking.  Great as a dip, spread, appetizer, or a meal with a few loaves of pita.

Humus was great! But it was too salty! I too had to throw it away...maybe a different type of salt like kosher it's ok 1 teaspoon...but not regular table salt.

Easy....definitely use less salt.  I thought 1 tsp was too much so I cut it down to 3/4 tsp and was still way too much.  I ended up using a 2nd can of garbanzo beans.  And definitely use a small clove of garlic.  I had a larger one and its a bit overwhelming even after the 2nd can of beans.

The consistency is amazing. I used the chick pea water about 2/3 of a cup I'd guess. I tried a little bit of the variation everyone wrote about with Cumin but I don't think I will again. I just used a bit.I love Garlic but I found the strength of the raw garlic a bit harsh for my taste, maybe just smaller cloves next time. I did forget the oil! I don't think that would make too much of a difference but maybe. It's good, just a little different.

Very bland as first written. I ended up tripling everything but the garbanzo beans.

Finally...an easy, inexpensive, healthy, and delicious recipe for an evening snack! I add extra lemon to mine, which makes it taste fresh and light. Love it with tortilla or pita chips! Thanks :)

HI

I didn't have tahini. I used a couple tbsp of sesame oil. This recipe is a really great place to start. Flavored hummus is the rage. So go wild. add artichoke, spinach. salsa, Never tried it but I guess you could even go sweet. maybe pineapple. Enjoy

When my daughter whipped up a batch of this hummus we both agreed that we could stop looking for a good hummus recipe.  This was it!  Sooo good!  We haven't tried it with cumin yet, just the black pepper, but I"m looking forward to trying the variations the author has posted with more garlic and tahini & the cumin.

Pretty good but the 3 tbsp.'s of lemon juice made it a little too lemony... I just added more salt.  Next time I'll use 2. But overall a very good recipe.

I like to make this for when I have guests over and serve it with some garlic pita chips, carrots sticks, and sugar snap peas. I follow the changes updated by the author in his review and it turns out perfect. The garlic flavor does come out a bit more after a few hours in the fridge.

So good!  I am never buying store-bought again! I did add less salt, and I am not really sure how much lemon juice I put in, because I just squeezed a whole lemon into it.  I did put in two cloves of garlic instead of one.  Delicious!

One small issue is that I find garbanzo beans in 15.5oz cans-not 19oz. It seems like it comes out fine anyway.. I loved using the roasted and smashed (I haveno proper grinder) cumin was a very nice touch. I have to agree with Sarah on the name, and would suggest you call it after the city/town/village from which your family came do many generations ago, or great granma's. In any case, I do like this recipe, and  I wonder how many other people have used 15.5 oz. cans and not even realized it? A fresh cilantro garnish is also nice.

I love this recipe!  We have made it many times and it is so much cheaper than buying hummus.  Plus, it tastes better and you can tweak it any way you like to add variety.

Wonderful base...I used two 15oz cans of chick peas, put one in with all the water and one I drained the water because I like my hummus a little bit creamier. Ran that through the food processor, then added everything else a little bit at a time to taste. It came out perfect. I would agree though that doing this in a blender might not work, and that a food processor is the better way to go...this recipe would have destroyed my blender.

This is a wonderful hummus!  If you can get garlic snapes, they're a great substitute for the sharper garlic. I haven't tried using cumin instead of pepper, but will try that next time.  The juice from one whole lemon is usually the right amount & saves you trying to measure fresh lemon juice (a pain!). I use Trader Joe's organic garbanzo beans, but they are made with sea salt, so I only use 1/4 tsp of salt, if any.  4 big Tbsp of tahini gives a nice strong tahini flavor.  I also start with only a few Tbsp of the liquid and pour slowly into working food processor until I get the consistency I want.  Toasted pine nuts are a nice addition, along with a little paprika.  It doesn't need olive oil.

I really loved this recipe but made 2 small changes after reading some of the reviews.  I only used 3T lemon juice and 1/2tsp of salt.  For me this was plenty of tang and salt.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 since I made those changes but this is definitely the best hummus I have made.  Great recipe!

It really was very salty, possibly because of using the reserved chick pea liquid. If I make it again, I will use water.

No more posting on hummus...didn't even know what hummus was until I got an email from "diabetics r us" about how healthy it is...vs. a McBurger...good alternative to mashed Pinto beans (a.k.a., burritos) or pasta/tomatoes (a.k.a spaghetti)....hard for vegans to get variety....check out the degree of Antioxidants in beans...cool....

Wow, real hummus is amazing!! I followed the recipe before reading the reviews, and it came out perfectly. I used a 15 oz can of garbanzo beans (because that was the only size I saw), 2 Tbsp tahini, 1 tsp salt, juice of one lemon, 2 cloves of garlic, and about half of the liquid from the can of beans. I haven't garnished it yet, but it tastes delicious - the best hummus I've ever tried! If I do say so myself :-)

I tried this as written and it was just OK.  After reading several of the other user's reviews, I decided to make the following changes:

- Nuke the chickpeas in the microwave for three minutes.
- Pop them out of the casing by simply squeezing the pea slightly between two fingers. (this is a little bit time consuming - took all of 10 minutes or so - but was WELL worth it.  The consistency is MUCH smoother.
- Add a bit of cumin.
- Cut back on the lemon juice to half.

Great recipe! I'm so excited how it turned out. A few adjustments, I made it with dry chickpeas (bought a big bag and needed to a way to finish it). I only added on clove of garlic which was strong enough, I added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice then added more to taste and thanks to HORTA's review I went easy on the salt.

When I make again, I will cut back the lemon juice (used 2 T and will cut back to less than 1 T).  Also, will switch out the pepper for cumin as the author suggests in a later post.  Will lighten up on salt also.  Very creamy and good.  Will make again.

I guess this hummus recipe was okay...  I added a change to the second batch I made because the first batch was too... "Canned Food" tasting. The change was that I used freshly cooked non-canned chickpeas... It came out better, but still overall, it was okay.

This is so easy. I used recipe update from author. Found I needed to add more cumin, lemon juice, and tahini than called for. I also added sun dried tomatoes and next time will add pine nuts. Great Recipe. Thanks!

Great recipe. Not overbearing. I left out the pepper and oil. I just added a bit of water to help blend the hummus smooth. I also used half the salt.

We love this recipe! I follow the recipe almost as written with the exception of cutting the salt in half for health reasons. Other than that I simply double it because it goes so fast between my husband and myself. This is my go to recipe for hummus. Delicious!

Wow!  I was skeptical, because I REALLY like my store-bought hummus and canned chickpeas don't smell so great.  But we love it...even the kids were scarfing it down.  Per other reviewers, I used half the salt, 1/2 tsp. of cumin instead of pepper, and no lemon juice (just because I was out of it.)  I'll try the lemon next time.

I followed the recipe exactly except I replaced the 1 clove of raw garlic with 5 cloves of roasted garlic, which gave a sweeter, more garlic flavor. The texture of this hummus is excellent though! That is what I've found lacking in most hummus recipes. The proportions are perfect!

so easy to make, and much tastier than store-bought hummus! the lemon does make it taste a little overly-tangy, but that may be because i'm used to more bland varieties purchased in the grocery store. i did make a double-batch and froze one half of it...when defrosted, the hummus was not quite as creamy, but still delicious.

What is better than cheap, easy, delicious, crowd pleaser?  Thank you for this wonderful recipe and your update.  For those dissing this fine recipe, obviously add/delete things to your taste but stick with the basics.  Garlic, chickpeas, tahini, and lemon juice.  This recipe allows you to add whatever you feel and never fails to amaze!

Used 2 cans of organic garbanzo beans, lots of cumin and most if the liquid from
1 of the cans of beans.  This isn't amazing, but a starring point for something that could be tasty.

This was wonderful! It was a tad salty but I liked it. Next time I can always use fresh cooked chick peas instead if I don't want it as salty. But it was perfect for dipping veggies! This will be my one and only starter recipe for sure!

This is one of the best hummus recipes I have ever had. ALso, it was very simple to make. 

I doubled the amount of garlic and I added a little bit of vinegar because, well, I like sour and I am a fan of garlic. I also served this with homemade pitas.

I will absolutely make this again.

I used no black pepper, more garlic (love garlic!) and less salt.  Best recipe I've found.  Great as a base to make your own flavors.

This is a pretty good hummus. I use less liquid because I like it a little thicker, and less salt. This is the base for any great hummus flavor...just add some roasted red peppers or other veggies. Kids will eat it even with greens in it :)

Great recipe. I've tried other recipes for hummus and always ended up throwing most of it away, not with this one. Really simple and good. I used the 3 tbsp on tahini like the author recommended in her update.

I had never tried hummus before, but I was tired of the same old, same old. So I bought the stuff and made some hummus. Used fresh beans. Mine turned out fairly chunky as I don't have a food processor or blender, but I still thought it was fantastic! Thanks Roy!

This is the perfect base to start with. I make it in greater quantities now, split the batch and flavor separately. So quick and easy, I always have a container in the fridge now. 
I cut back the liquid to what amounts to 1/4 of the liquid per 32 oz. Thanks for this great recipe!!

I just made this. I used the OP's revised recipe (more tahini, more garlic, less salt) and it is divine. Next time I'll probably just amp up the garlic and keep the tahini the original measurement. I added the recommended dash of cumin, and a little cayenne for myself. I blended the olive oil right in to the hummus since I'm making a batch to keep handy in the fridge. This is PERFECT, and so deliciously creamy and wholesome. I can eat it by the spoonful! It's so much tastier than any store bought hummus, and so much cheaper in the long run, too. :)

Made as per recipie decreased liquid, also tried with black beans instead of chickpeas - no liquid and more garlic - wished I had cumin to add flavour.

Great recipie!  Followed it pretty much to a T but used dried beans.  I ended up using about 1/2 pound dried beans and 3/4 cup of water.  Salt to taste since they were dried, not canned.  Add some minced jalapenos as a garnish for a little kick!

A great recipe for a traditional hummus, I followed the authors revised recipe  and came out with a nice creamy  hummus with  good flavor.  I reserved half and tarted up the remaining with extra garlic,smoked paprika and cayenne.  The parsley, paprika and olive oil garnishes add  more flavor and visual appeal. Way better than store bought .

I made this last night for a quick healthy snack and LOVED it!  I didn't measure anything, used minced garlic from a jar, hand squeezed a whole lemon in.  I had completely drained the can of beans, and not surprisingly, it was too dry, so I added in a little water.  Excellent!

Excellent recipe - and like all recipes can be adjusted to personal taste by adjusting the amounts of the ingredients.   To the person who gave up because it was "too salty" .. come on, be a chef--cut down on the salt!!!  You'll probably love it.

Thanks for this. Simple and with all the ingredients in a normal kitchen (perhaps with tahini as the exception). The only change I did was add a little water at the end to make it a little smoother (at first it kind of has the consistency of cookie dough -- which is still good but I prefer it a little smoother -- maybe that is what the reserved liquid was for? I didn't see what to do with it in the instructions. Also, instead of salt I added Matt's Mix All Purpose Seasoning (Kosher salt, garlic, different herbs and such). I got it online mattsmix.com. Great simple recipe! Thanks!

Very good! I'm allergic to black pepper, so I left it out.  After reading the reviews, I think I will grind some cumin seeds and add to what I have left of it.  I also added a little bit of honey.  I used dried chickpeas that I cooked myself.  I suspect that I didn't get them as soft as canned would have been, but I just added more water and blended it quite a while.  I didn't have pita but had some homemade flour tortillas from the other night.  I crisped them up in the oven and broke them into pieces and it was very good!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe and loved the flavor.  I added a bit of cumin (per author's advice) and threw in a dash of sriracha sauce to heat it up a bit. Will def add to my recipe box as a go to.

I've made this hummus a couple of times now. The first time I put in a little bit of chile powder and used a hummus/tahini paste. It came out "ok", but I think I might have used too much lemon juice. The second time I made it with sesame seed butter because the aforementioned tahini paste had gone bad, and it tasted great!

This is a great recipe! After experimenting with hummus for a while, I have found what me and my family love most. I have to use all of the liquid from the can to get it thin enough. I add alot more garlic because we love it! I used 2 heaping T of tahini, 1/4 c. lemon juice, and added cumin as well. It is awesome!

You have to use the tahini - it adds so much to this dish.  I make it and eat it right away, even though it tastes better wtih a little fridge time.

This is the real deal.  Restaurant quality for sure.  I add about a half a teaspoon of cumin instead of black pepper, and serve it with a couple slices of lemon on the side as well as a couple dashes of paprika and cumin on top and a drizzle of olive oil.

Despite some reviews, we did use peanut butter (actually we used PB2) instead of tahini. The hummus came out with great texture and flavor. I think that it is very customizable and next time I will make it with sun-dried tomatoes for a bit stronger flavor. I am only giving it a 4, however, because it does separate a bit in the fridge after only 2 days.

This hummus is awesome!  The only thing I did differently was sprinkle some paprika on top with a drizzle of olive oil.  The red paprika made for a beautiful presentation and a little extra smokiness!

I'm never buying store-bought hummus again. Followed the recipe as is and then just adjusted the ingredients to taste. I like a more lemony hummus, so ended up adding a bit more of that. I used 15-oz cans of garbanzo beans because that's all my store had, and it turned out great.

So flipping good.  I used the revised version given by the author. I fresh squeezed half a lemon into the mix instead of measuring it out.  Better than anything you can get in the store (and comparable to what I would find at my favorite Lebanese restaurant- just wish I had a recipe for the hot sauce they serve there with the hummus!).

This is a good foundation but it was way too salty for my taste.  I would recommend blending all the ingredients first and then add salt to taste.  I also cut back on the lemon and just used 2 tablespoons.

I wish I read the below review before making this!  It was definitely too salty, and perhaps had a bit too much lemon in it.  But it was really easy to make, and cheaper than buying it in the store, so I will attempt again.

Did not like this recipe.  Very salty and tasted too much like the tahini paste.  I will try again but next time I will not add salt until the end and will cut back on the tahini paste.

I have made this a few times and am always asked for the recipe. Personally I find it too garlicky sometimes but I definitely blame it on the garlic that I have on hand. Now I make it with one clove, taste and add more if needed. 
Thanks for such a great recipe

I was out of lemon juice so that's probably be why, but this hummus is kid of bland. I added more garlic and that helped a little. Very quick to make, except a bit difficult in the blender (mine is an older model). I used a potatoe masher in the end.

Finally!! a hummus recipe that's not dry. I've made a ton of recipes lately and this is the first one that I actually like as much as Trader Joe's hummus as far as flavor and consistency. I would maybe just cut down on the salt just a touch and definitely stick with one garlic clove.

I love hummus, and have always bought it.  Not anymore, this is great, I also cut the lemon juice down to 3 T.  I also added flat leaf italian parsley, yummy.

Tasty hummus! I boiled the chickpeas after soaking them overnight, and added a dash of paprika powder on top. Yum with whole wheat pita!

I followed the author's update and it was perfect.  I served it to guests who where new to hummus, and they loved it!
