Lose the egg and use milk instead (better yet, buttermilk). Add more seasonings! There is no way 3 tablespoons will give you 1/4 inch of oil in the bottom of a large fry pan, and, as another reviewer mentioned, a good southener would never use olive oil for fried "t'maters". 

From a transplanted Alabamian...

my boyfriend was a cook in a really nice southern restaurant, and he dipped them in milk instead of egg and fries them in canola oil.  I think they come out a lot better without the 'eggy' taste.

OMGOODNESS!  I think the cornmeal adds a little crunch to this normally soggy side.  I love them this way.  This is always how I make fried green tomatoes.  I use some salt and pepper, too.  Try this:  dip the tomato in egg then flour then egg then cornmeal.  If desired, add the salt and pepper to the flour.  YUMMMMMY!

A good Southern cook knows that OLIVE OIL would drown the flavor of Fried Green Tomatoes! YUK!

This recipe needs tweaking for us.  I fried one, using Canola Oil, and tasted it, then added garlic salt, onion powder, and garlic pepper to the cornmeal mixture, MUCH better with the additions.

Wonderful recipe!  All I added was salt and pepper, and changed the oil to vegetable cooking oil.  I didn't measure it, just poured it in the pan and used what I needed.  When I was finished, I addedthe egg/milk mixture to the remaining cornmeal mixture; mixed it into a dough, formed small cakes with it and fried it in the same oil the tomatoes were fried in.  YUM! My husband loved it! This was the first, and only recipe I'll ever try.  It is perfect!

Sadly, I have to agree with some of the other reviews. The Olive Oil overpowers the delicate taste of the green tomatoes and the smoke point of the Olive Oil does not allow them to get crispy enough. 

The cornmeal is good, though. It's authentic in parts of the south.

You have to start with the right tomato. Saucing or juicing tomatoes just do not fry, bake or stew well. You need fleshy, meaty tomatoes- not the ones filled with seed pockets and juice. Don't expect supermarket tomatoes to fry well. They've probably been frozen and will be mealy. Get your green toms from your garden or a farmer and view the cut open flesh."Big Boy" and "Beefsteak" are two types that fry well when green. I salt the slices to drain off some of the moisture and bitterness before I bread or batter them. Some folks like the acidity and use buttermilk to increase it. Fried green toms are considered a southern "curiosity" but it's really just a variation on the centuries old fried eggplant and tastes almost identical (Try a few sprinkles of basil, oregano and Parmesean cheese on the toms!). I fry my green toms in olive oil (not EVOO) and/or other oil blends, depending on the flavor I want. Traditionally in the south, bacon grease or lard would've been used to fry 'em in, and I sometimes go with tradition. I find Olive oil, garlic and Toms are "naturals" together. Buy when the price is low and freeze them. They can be preped, breaded and frozen on sheet pans or waxed paper, then bagged and fried from the freezer, just like eggplant or Okra...try green tomato "chips" from your dehydrator!

GREAT....glad to see someone else uses olive oil, much healthier!  I added a little onion powder, salt and pepper to my milk/egg mixture for flavor, and half Italian bread crumbs/half corn meal. Very good, the Italian bread crumbs give a bit more flavor.  So I guess I made the "Italian Fried Green Tomatoes"...also used zucchini - YUM.

No one in my family liked this dish. Perhaps it's an acquired taste. It was easy enough to make however, I had to double the egg and milk to have enough. I would suggest frying in vegetable oil since olive oil tends to burn easily if it gets too hot.

I grew up in rural Alabama, and the most authentic way to make this is simply buttermilk-SELF-RISING cornmeal + prpper-canola oil.  The green tomatoes have such a unique, clean and crisp flavor, I don't think it needs additional spices.

This is a great base recipe.... i would replace the milk with 1/2 cup or less buttermilk, drop the egg,  veggie oil instead of olive oil, after slicing tomatoes sprinkle slices with salt pepper onion powder and sugar go light on the sugar.

I absolutely love fried green tomatoes. I did change a few things. I used milk only (no egg). I also didn't use the flour just cornmeal (sweet cornmeal). They came out so crunchy with thick batter. mmm, so good.  Then salt and pepper to taste.

Think these would have turned out better if deep fried.  Next time will do that.  Otherwise was just OK.

These were really good, but I added salt, pepper, paprika, and a little sugar to the flour/cornmeal mixture, 'cause that's what my mamaw used to do, these tasted just like hers!  I also threw in a Tbsp. of bacon grease with the olive oil, yummy!

Yummmm- Just like my Mama used to make! I don't use as much breading, I really try to shake off as much as I can. Also- us Southerners love that salt! We sprinkle way too much salt on these babies! Execellent recipe- thank you Sharon!

I never "ate" fried green tomatoes until I became an adult.  I made your recipe!  I offered my boyfriend some and he said, "No!"  I ate all 6 slices myself, including the last one in the batch that I sort of bured!  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

Try adding crushed seasoned stuffing crumbs (in the package). Crush finely then use in place of cornmeal.

the cornmeal took away from the flavor as well as the texture of the green tomatoes.  Not the best coating to use for this recipe.

I added lemon pepper to the cornmeal/flour blend and cooked on low heat, which kept the browning under control. They were delicious!

Very bland.  A life-long Southern resident that has eaten more fried green tomatoes than most people can imagine, I have never eaten any with ABSOLUTELY NO SEASONING!  A little salt and ground black pepper is a MUST!
