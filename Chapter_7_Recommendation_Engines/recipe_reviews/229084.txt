Made exactly as written. Wish I would have bought chives to create better antennae with. These were good! I think next time I'll do more to kick up the flavors though. Cinnamon and nutmeg in the cream cheese mix, maybe? Or sitting on top of something.. like crumbled chocolate cookies. Extra flavor and more effect.

I made it but I used full fat cream cheese since I had it on hand and added fresh ground nutmeg and cinnamon for flavor. They tasted great! We could not stay out of them. But I do recommend adding these spices to the recipe. I think the dates would be bland without them.

This is an old family recipe we make every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. we put powdered sugar on top and just call them "stuffed dates". We only do this using medjol dates.
