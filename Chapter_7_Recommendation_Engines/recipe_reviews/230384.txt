Super easy, kids like it also. I felt it was sweet and would serve it with brown rice next time for a good flavor blend.  NEW NOTE:  Made again with only 1/8 cup of honey and 1 T of olive oil.  Glad I did bkz it's still sweet.  Placed the fillets in a baking dish instead of foil.  Feel that a smaller portion of recipe would work for the 5 fillets I used.

Way too sweet. If I were to make it again I would decrease the honey by half. Also, the mixture over the fish turned very liquidy, the fish wasn't browned. The fish looked unappetizing and pale. Perhaps broiling might be a better way to cook the fish and mixture.

My kids and I loved this recipe!  I didn't wrap the fish in foil, I just placed the fish in a glass baking dish and covered with the sauce.  Drying the thawed fish with a paper towel can reduce the 'watery' consistency of the sauce.

Great recipe for swai!

However, this came out a little bit sweet for my tastes, so I used about a tablespoon of soy sauce, paprika, and some cumin seeds. Turned out perfectly! This is a very good and flexible starting point for your own swai recipe.

Super easy! Super tasty! I would recommend this if you're introducing someone to fish or you are short on time an want to make an impression. I added a little paprika for color and otherwise followed it exactly. And I used a 9x13 dish instead of individual foil packets. Cook and serve in the same dish - perfect!

This has become one of our favorite dinners! The only thing I change is instead of Dijon mustard I use honey mustard. It makes the fish so light and sweet. We serve the fish over white rice. Mmmmmmmmmmmm....delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly although I cooked it on the BBQ oin med heat, just above the gas.  13 mins exactly.  Perfectly cooked.  And delicious but next time I will double the drizzle ingredients for more sauce. Served with rice.  Can't wait to try again.

The family really liked this recipe. Anything my 7 year old son will devour is good in my book. Followed the recipe to a T. Turned out really well. I will say the sauce is pretty close to my favorite honey mustard recipe.

This was delicious and even our picky teenage boys ate it faster than we did.  No complaints so this mom gives it a two thumbs up.  Wouldn't change anything and yes we had to cook longer.

This had a nice taste but for me it was lacking some "zing"   It was way too liquidy.  But all in all, a nice way to cook fish.  I did use Basa too.

As everyone said, way too sweet. I will try it with less honey and more spices, especially mustard. Very good, though.

This was wonderful! I used yellowtail which worked very well. I used a lot less honey (about 2 tsp) after reading some reviews and the balance was perfect. I also added some spices to the sauce (black pepper, cayenne pepper and salt) which added a bit more zing. Definately a recipe I will make again; thanks for sharing :)

Very good.  I made as directed with Swai (2 fillets, 1 pound).  My wife and I really liked the sauce.  We are making it again with Hake (From South Africa) tonight.  This was a favorite fish when we traveled there.

I made this for supper last night and was very disappointed. The sauce tasted good, but the fish was mushy. I threw it in some olive oil and fried it until it was golden brown, and that's the only thing that saved it.

The flavor was nice, but the consistency was horrible. The sauce was so watery, it was like poaching the fish. I tried draining off most of the liquid halfway through, but it didn't help. After it was done baking, I plan fried it for 5 minutes to crisp it up and give it a nicer appearance.  Next time I will pan dry it the whole way. I did cut back the honey by about half, would have been way too sweet otherwise.  And I added some seasonings,  salt, pepper, garlic and Italian.

Excellent recipe! I used regular Dijon mustard, and substituted Splenda for the honey, since I'm diabetic.

This was delicious! I didn't change anything,  except I used Steelhead fish. We had company, and I never try a new dish with company.  But it was very successful,  and is now in my "Favorites " list.  Thanks to whoever created it.

I altered this recipe a little the first time based on what I had on hand. Instead of dijon I used regular mustard, and instead of lemon I actually used orange juice. Turned out surprisingly good albeit lacking. Could really taste the fishyness of the basa through the sauce.

The second time I made it I followed the recipe as is and it was great! A lot stronger, more of a bite, and mixed much better with the fish's natural taste.

I was making a lot so I didn't cover it individually with foil. However, I did use foil on its bottom--- It was like soup, it was very watery. So, since it was too watery, the mustard mixture didn't stick to the fish. Which gave me a very bland result.  In the end I had to transfer it out of the pan since it was literally mustard soup.  Luckily I had some of the mustard mixture left so I place some on top of cooked fish.

This is the first time I have reviewed something! This fish was amazing! I kept the recipe the same. However, I didn’t do the foil pack, I just put it in a dish. My hubby and 15 month old ate it all!

Sounds awesome,  I'm making it tomorrow, a lot of reviews say it's to sweet. A major suggestion, instead of honey try agave nectar, it's a wet but not to sweet a nice sub. For honey.... and if you like fish try a ginger bake with Mahi mahi

Loved it. I did cut the honey down about 25%. I cooked a few minutes longer as my family likes the fish to flake. Followed everything else and it was awesome.

Amazing. I changed it a bit. Instead of making foil pouches I did foil boats with 2 thick slices of lemon under it when baking at 425 degrees. With the sauce I added fresh parsley, cut back on the honey (my honey is fresh and extra sweet) sprinkled paprika on top. After it was fully cooked (23-30 min for me) I put the broiler on for a bit to brown the top. I made extra sauce to use as a dipping sauce. Everyone loves it, even ones who don't like fish. I will be making it again.

Really enjoyed it. I used honey dijon & regular mustard since I forgot to decrease the honey as many reviewers suggested for it not to be overly sweet. I also added a little bit of my fav spices to the pat dried frozen swai fillets and I followed rest of recipe. It turned out great & I served with steamed brocolli, cauliflowers & carrots blend veggies & 1/4 cup of rice to enjoy the sauce. Magnificent, quick and inexpensive meal. What more could you ask for; the only think I will do next time is try baking it without the foil packets that invariably leaked. I will try using a 9x13 baking dish next time .

Love this delicious easy recipe as does my family. Great for any mild whitefish - I like for swai, tilapia, would work for catfish too. I lower the honey and lemon juice a bit, just personal preference. I also open packets after initial bake and cook for about 10 more minutes open to firm up fish. I don't saturate fish in sauce, just coat, and save extra to add after cooking. So good and fairly quick.

No changes but will cook it a few more minutes next time.  Tip..  Make sure to pat dry to avoid the watery part after.

I recommend using half of the ingredients just because it does come out a little bit too watery.  I also had to bake it for an additional 15 minutes uncovered. All in all it had a delicious flavor. I serve mine over quinoa and brown rice and drizzle some of the leftover sauce on top.

I went off on a tangent and decided to take this in a spicy-sweet direction. I added just a pinch of the following herbs and spices: mustard seed, powdered ginger, coriander, cayenne, coarse black pepper, crushed red pepper, dill seed, garlic powder. It sounds like a lot but it was really just the littlest bit of each. It came out really amazing and it was a total crowd pleaser. Served with a broccoli and cauliflower mix and a really herby savory rice.

This is a great recipe.  My 3 & 6 yr old kids loved it as well.  This will be a staple in my house.  I drained the fish after 5 minutes and then put the sauce on and cooked it for 9 minutes. Delicious!   I made it with brown rice and peas.

The kids and husband both loved it.  I served it over a bed of romaine lettuce topped with brown rice.  Poured the extra sauce over each.

Beautiful and yummy.

Absolutely delicious.  Easy to fix ahead of time and then throw in the oven as guests arrive.  I use an open baking pan and make sure that both sides of the fish are coated with the the sauce rather than just pouring it over the top.  I have used convection which takes much less time AND gives it a light browning.

Oh wow, the sauce on this is amazing! I followed the recipe only adding dill weed and Old Bay (my favorites with fish).

I checked after 10 minutes and the fishy were squishy but not done. Hmmm...I took them out and grabbed the fry pan; the fish promptly fell apart so I admitted defeat and browned what was whole on both sides. 

Basa Swai fish are wonderful tasting and are a naturally SOFT fish. The ingredients were simply too heavy and too moist for an oven bake. I will fry next time. 

I have two more fillets and that beautiful sauce will be brushed lightly on each side before frying, and on the table for dipping! 
The fish tasted fantastical. Thanks for sharing Loved it.

Fish moist but a little too moist/mushy.  Was surprised that the mustard tasted good with the fish.  Very watery sauce.

This recipe  has an excellent sauce, I've never had Swai before, therefore unsure of the texture of the fish.  That is the reason I rated it 4 stars.

Very sweet. A little mushy. I opened up the foil for the last five minutes and let it cook an extra five minutes.  Served with brown rice and green beans.

This recipe was super quick and easy, and the sauce was delicious!  I prepared it using tilapia filets.  The only change I made was to open up the foil packets after about 8 minutes, and I finished baking another 6-7 minutes.

This was the most delicious swai recipe I have ever had. I tweaked it a little by adding black pepper and then some shredded cheese the last three minutes. Fantastic, I would recommend it to anyone. The Dijon (I used regular for I didnt have whole grain) was a perfect amount.
