I scaled this recipe to 4 servings and increased the garlic substantially (used 2 cloves). It was really flavorful after sitting in the refrigerator a few hours. My wife and I both loved it on Ritz crackers. I used real butter which I think gave it a rather hard consistency. Next time I may try using whipped margarine instead. I don't think you can go wrong playing with this recipe and adjusting it to your individual liking.Good stuff Natalia.

This was yummy, yummy, yummy.  It came out the consistency of buttercream frosting, so it was very easy to spread on the bread.  It is very light, and great for summer.   You can taste all of the flavors, but it isn't overpowering.  My 6 year old practically ate a loaf of bread herself with this spread.  All the adults, and kids raved about it.  This will definitely become a "family favorite."  Thanks for the great recipe.  I served this on french bread, along with "Best Italian Sausage Soup submitted by Perri Pender.  The soup was sumptious too!

This was awesome the first time I made it. But the second time I made it I sauted the garlic in the butter in a pan then mixed everything together (warm butter helped soften the cream cheese too) and it was absolutly great. Of course I added more garlic too.

I tossed everything in the food processed and processed until completely smooth.  I was looking for more of a cream cheese flavor so I was disappointed that the butter was so strong.  I served this on toasted bread slices topped with an olive tapenade so I couldn't really taste the butter unless I ate the spread by itself, so that's good.  If I make this again for a bagel spread or something, I'll try halving or omitting the butter.

I loved this spread sooo much! It was amazing on warm soft garlic bread. I  added a little extra garlic and chopped the onion extra fine, but the recipe was quick and simple! DELICIOUS!

I cut this down to four servings and upped the garlic a bit. I also used the lower fat cream cheese (N-something, I can't spell it). I spread it on two leftover hoagie buns I split in half and stuck it under the broiler to warm/crisp it. Smells wonderful, makes me wish I weren't dieting. I'm serving it with the  Skillet Bow Tie Pasta also from this site. EDITED: My kids loved this, my husband did not.

This was SOOO good! I'm a huge fan of garlic, so I added an extra small clove and it was still super good.  I used another reviewers advice and made it the night before to let the flavors meld.  It was a hit!

i think this requires much more garlic before it can really be considered a "garlic spread"! :) i added 4 cloves and it came out just perfect.

Excellent.  I followed another reviewer and melted the butter with the garlic then added it a little bit at a time, stirring between each addition.  To turn this into a dip instead of a spread, i let this set in the fridge for a day or so to really let all the flavors meld together.  My picky two yr old loves this dip with crackers.

This sounds amazing!  My niece used to work at a pizza place that had a spread this sounds exactly like!  I'm with some of the others, though: I'll add more garlic when I make it!

I made this quick and simple spread yesterday and I found it to be so overwhelmingly excellent. This is a great dip to bring to a party with some Sociables' crackers. It took me about 15 minutes to make.

Very good, substitue the parsley and onion for green onion.  Also, use 2 cloves of garlic!

Yum!! I am so happy to have found this recipe. I love the garlic-butter-cream cheese dip that our favorite pizza place sells, and now I can make the dip at home. Only because it was what I had on hand, I used an 8oz package of Philly chive and onion cream cheese, and added the butter and garlic- mixing well until creamy. Fast, Easy, and Delicious!!

I had a left-over roasted garlic bulb from a recent get-together and used it (the whole bulb) instead of the garlic clove.  Just sqeeze the roasted garlic right out of each clove into the other ingredients and mix.  This is awesome  on toasted french baguettes!

I am really confused with some of the reviews left. they mention "onions" and " this is great warm right out of the oven". The recipe submitted does not list any of those items or instructions for baking in oven. Please explain or is the recipe not printed correctly??

Really easy and really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and got raves. The next time I made it, I doubled the garlic, but that's just personal taste. I served with Flipside and Ritz crackers, but almost any crackers would be good.

Excellent!!  I have also made it using bottled pesto sauce instead of the garlic, onion and parsley.  This is much better than the store bought garlic spread and is very versatile. Try stirring some into hot, cooked pasta for a quick and delicious side.

Was a little to much cream cheese for my original purpose, BUT I have found that this misxtures keeps excellently in the fridge and is a wonderful addition to alot of other sauces and marinades.

Wow. I did use a big clove of garlic which was more like 2 regular cloves. I used dried parsley since I didnt have fresh on hand. I couldnt decide if we would like this better spread on the bread and then baked or put on after so I made both ways. Both ways are good but something about a light smear of this over the bread and then baking it made it amazing. I made this with spaghetti but it would help richen up a cheaper pasta dish like spaghetti, butter, garlic and parm. Excellent.

Awesome! So creamy! We put this one Ciabatta split horizontally and baked in the oven. I used chive and onion cream cheese. The chive added color and flavor and I will not add the parley next time because of this. I also reduced the onion and garlic since flavoring was in the cream cheese already. (94)

I have used this same recipe with added ingredients to make awesome Boursin Cheese Spread.    To this Garlic Spread recipe add: 1/2 tsp. oregano, plus 1/8 tsp. EACH of dillweed, basil, marjoram and thyme.  This is such a good recipe I even take the spices measured in small plastic snack bags when I travel.

Great! Definitely let the spread sit for the 1 to 3 hours - I made it up and used it right away and didn't really get the full flavor till we heated up leftovers the next day. Husband & Grandma thought it was great and I will definitely use it again.

We liked this; I spread it on 1/2 French bread loaf, sprinkled with Parmesan, and then broiled it.  Thanks!

This is yummy!  I originally made it for the recipe on AR for Garlic Cheese Chicken Rollups, but the leftovers will have no problem being used up on various things.  I made it exactly as written and it's the perfect balance of flavors to me, but for an extra throw in another clove or two of garlic!

Delicious just out of the oven or refridgerated. Don't be afraid to put a little extra garlic in it!

This was so good!! It reminds me of a spread that a local restaurant used to serve with their Italian bread years ago. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried Italian seasoning instead.  Next time, I will definitely use the fresh parsley.

I used green onions instead of reg onions. I also added more pureed garlic. To make a great appetizer I cut out the butter used whipped cream cheese,xtra garlic and green onions and added shaved ham. Then put out bagel chips,crackers etc. Should have made more everyone loved it.

Really good spread.  I used 1/3 fat cream cheese, and margarine.  I also used a little onion poweder rather than the onions.  Used fresh basil & fresh oregeno.  Delish on sliced sourdough bread & broiled.   I used the Fast & Friendly Meatball recipe from this site to make Meatball sandwiches with it.  Yum!

Very good, however, too much onion.  I think next time I will use 1 TBSP of onion powder instead.  Or maybe puree the onion.  But anyway, really good, very easy, would make it again. Thanks!

I made this spread in a pinch. I had all of the ingredients and used it immediately. The garlic taste was mild compared to the smell so I added garlic powder. Instead of using butter I used margarine. I only gave it three stars because of the mild taste. I will remake it with butter and less cream cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

This is so good. The only thing I did different was add an extra clove of garlic.  Next time I may add spring onions instead. Nice and creamy.

Surprisingly good. Often the simplest ingredients will yield great results -and this did! I didn't change anything, but did allow it to set at room temp to soften a little before serving. We used this as a spread for crackers, but it would make an excellent bagel spread.

This was tasty but can get a little strong after sitting in the fridge over night. I would recommend cutting down the recipe and only making it if you are planning on using it all the first day.

I followed the others and added more garlic. I softened the cream cheese and butter in the microwave. I made a garlic and broccoli pizza. I spread the dough, added  the garlic spread ( I needed it like now so I didn't but in the fridge but next time I will), added the broccoli then mozzarella cheese and  sprinkled garlic salt and red pepper flakes on top . It was a hit. Hubby and the kids loved it.

Wow, this was excellent! I made half a recipe just to try it, but added 2 cloves of garlic and even some garlic powder. I used soft-spread butter (worked great) so it would be ready to spread on a Ritz cracker whenever I wanted one, and also used dried minced onion flakes. This will NOT be going out with other appetizers when the family come for their Christmas visit! :)  Thanks CKBK for the recipe!

Used this recipe for "Garlic Cheese Chicken Rollups." The only modification I did was to add some garlic powder. Really tasty with the garlic powder.

not a bad basic recipe. I added parsley, dill, and basil to the cream cheese and butter mixture. I'm loving it! I've never attempted a dip before and this was definitely a great start! Thank you so much! I'll definitely be flaunting this at parties this summer!

This is a good spread. It tastes like Philadelphia Chive and Onion spread. I prefer a more buttery garlic spread, so I'll probably stick to my other recipe, but this is tasty.

So rich - a very different garlic spread, but good.  I only used half the cream cheese, more garlic and mixed in some fresh, grated parmesan.  No complaints, but I think they like my regular garlic bread better.
