This was delicious.  I used rotisserie chicken. I couldn’t find the breadsticks so I used a can of pizza dough, which turned out great.   I’ll make it again.  Everyone liked it.

2.24.19  I used a can of cream of mushroom soup, had no cream of chicken soup on hand, which worked out fine.  The salsa was “hot,” so it gave the pies a nice little kick.  I went to two stores, neither had the can of refrigerated soft breadsticks.  Since I didn’t feel like going on a road trip to find them, I just used a can of crescent roll dough sheets and cut strips for the crust.  I cooked this recipe in four individual pie pans, and they were done at 12 minutes.   I must say these were incredibly easy to make, had nice eye appeal, and although I had my concerns that this recipe would be bland, it turned out pretty well.  I cooked several chicken breasts in the Instant Pot® for this recipe this morning, but this would be a great recipe for rotisserie chicken you buy at the store.

Mmm. This was so simple and delicious. I was looking for a quick and easy dinner, and this definitely did the trick. I loved the zesty flavor the salsa and peppers brought to the chicken. I sprinkled some shredded cheese over the breadsticks which gave it even more flavor. Will be making again.
