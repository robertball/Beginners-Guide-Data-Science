I made a chocolate graham cracker crust in this pie. I did make this a little lighter using sugar free pudding mix, cold fat free evaporated milk and "light" whipped topping. Noone noticed I used lighter ingredients--my husband ate half the pie in 24 hours! I'd like to try this with instant chocolate pudding next time--I bet that would be fantastic.

I made this with chocolate pudding instead of vanilla to make a mochaccino pie as another chef suggested.  Instead of regular instant coffee I added decaf instant coffee.  I also folded in an entire 8 oz. tub of cool whip and put none on top.  Instead of refrigerating it I stuck it into the freezer to settle.  It came out tasting more like an ice cream type of pie.  We really enjoyed it.  Definitely a keeper.

This pie was really good. I used the larger package of pudding (yet still just one cup of millk), then folded in 4 ounces of Cool Whip and the pie was set up perfectly after about an hour.

This is very tasty, but next time I won't add the whipped topping to the pudding mixture. This prevents it from setting properly and makes the pie sloppy. I'll keep the cool whip on top!

I didn't make this exactly as written. I used a teaspoon of instant espresso powder. I also used a large package of vanilla pudding (.5. oz) with only 2 cups of milk (as opposed to 3). This almost filled the crust. If I'd used the 3.5 oz, sheesh, there would not have been enough filling. Lastly I didn't use chemically altered oils to top it, I used whipped cream which was actually cheaper. What I ended up with was a fast easy pie with a taste that was sweet, unsophisticated and mildly compelling. After I "made" it, I let it stiffen up in the freezer for an hour before serving. If you absolutely had to make this as a carry along, you could add some gelatin to your whipped cream to prevent it from deconstrucing.

very good.  i omitted the cool whip b/c the 1st time i tried it with it - it was very runny.  the 2nd time i made it w/o it and added a layer of chocolate pudding on top of the vanilla pudding with the coffee granules and then a layer of whip cream - awesome!!  awesome!!  you have to try it if you are a coffee lover!!

This is one of my favorite pies. I took this to work and my co-workers practically licked the pie plate clean. Trust me, you won't have any left-overs, but it's so easy you can make two and keep one at home for yourself. ONE TIP: Freeze the pie instead of chilling in the fridge. It's too runny if you don't freeze it.

To make it thicker, I used 2 boxes of white chocolate pudding mix, and upped the milk to 1 cup and a half.  Mixed half the whipped cream into the pie, and put half on top, sets up very well in the frig.

This pie sounded so good, I had to try it immediately!  The recipe called for 3 tablespoons of instant coffee, which made my pie filling very strong and bitter-tasting.  The next time I make this pie, I'm going to use less coffee.  I think it will be delicious!

This had a good flavor but I tried freezing it as others have suggested, and it became very icy.  Next time (and I will definitely try it again), I will probably only freeze for a couple of hours and then move it back to the refrigerator.

Great pie! I followed reviewers suggestions to set the pie in the freezer and add the whip cream later. Perfect consistency and flavor that way!  Definitely eat within a day or 2 max because if kept frozen it tastes too icy. I used 3 of those individual packets of Taster's Choice Hazelnut coffee singles (they look about a tbsp each) and it added a yummy hazelnut flavor to the pie!  Also, I didn't have a chocolate bar so I shaved milk chocolate chips with a cheese grater over the top..looked nice!

Very good, I did substitute Dark Chocolate pudding for vanilla. This is a lot like the mousse recipe at one time on the Jello instant pudding box, also very good.
Raedwulf- It does work better if you had used 2 cups of milk and  8 ounces of whipped topping. It also works better if you refrigerate it for about 4 hours. This should take care of ppls runny pie problems.

This was so easy to make and delicious! I made it with skim milk and regular everything-else and the texture and taste was still excellent. I'm going to make it again for my office's Christmas luncheon.

WOW - I needed a real quick dessert and searched this website and found Cappuccino Pie.  I could'nt have asked for a simpler more delicious creamy pie.  I'm going to make several as I know they will freeze well.

It was very easy to make and the filling had a good taste to it.  The only thing was, the pudding was kind of a soupy mess when I cut into the pie... And that was after refrigerating all night.  Next time I would try following the directions on the jello instant pudding mix, and adding 2 cups of milk like it says, and leaving out the whipped topping, to see if that helps firm the pudding up.  I also used spray whipped cream for the top instead.  It was a very good pie if you like coffee!

I made this for our annual Chili Pie cook-off, and my pie won first place. I used an extra half box of pudding, and a little less whipped cream. Instead of putting whipped cream on top, I wanted the judges to see the brown color. I also drew a cappuccino cup with syrup and put real coffee beans as garnish. It was a big hit and so SO easy!!

Like others have said, mine was a little runny but the flavor was amazing! I'm going to try some of the suggestions to make it settle correctly next time=)

Mine also came out a little sloppy, but the flavor more than made up for what it may have lacked in looks!

If you love coffee you'll LOVE this recipe.  It is so light and so yummy, and if you use low fat ingredients it is also lo-cal.  I made it for a party and it was devoured.  I have had to give the recipe to all of my friends.

It didn't firm up properly so I don't think I'll make it again.. tasted good but looked like slop on the plate.
