I left my butter out to become quite soft, used light brown sugar with the cinnamon & could blend easily with a fork. Was able to leave out on the counter for a week this summer (never lasted longer than that)to make cinnamon toast for the kids. Now making a bowl each week for DS to make the cinnamon toast the kids beg for each morning before school.

Made this as directed accept I added a dash of vanilla. Turned out amazing. Popped some crescent rolls in the oven and they tasted like cinnamon rolls with this butter spread! It is a fast and easy hit with the family.

Just what I needed. My daughter used this to make cinnabunnies for Easter. The proportions of butter to sugar were perfect, we doubled the cinnamon though. Leftovers were happily used on toast. Thank you Shorecook for your recipe! :-)

I just made this right now to use as a glaze for my pumpkin muffins. I used to Stevia in the raw because I am diabetic; other than that, everything else is the same and it was just enough to glaze my muffins as you can see -- thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe for an appetizer spread on a loaf of French bread.   The rest of the meal was Cajun, and I wanted this to have a little of that flair  so I added to this 1/8 teaspoon of ground Allspice.   This recipe, with or without the Allspice is wonderful and I will definitely make this again.   Thank you for a great recipe Shorecook.

Delicious and a hit at a party. I served this with a sliced loaf of  Cranberry Walnut bread I got from my local bakery. I would make this again. May  even try some cream cheese spreads similar to this to compare.

I made this using light brown sugar because that’s what I had on hand. We used it for sweet potato topping on New Year’s Eve. It was a hit!! This will be a staple in our home. (The second time I used a little more brown sugar and a little bit more cinnamon.)

I don't know why I never thought of this before. I did change up the recipe a little because I was out of brown sugar so I just added a little molasses to regular white sugar. It was grainy so I heated it up in the microwave until the butter melted and then just blended it with a fork until the sugar dissolved. Regular brown sugar may not need this or maybe someone else might not mind the graininess. I can see putting this on toast, biscuits, pancakes, waffles and in oatmeal, sweet potatoes or carrots.

I made this and found it to be rather bland and grainy. I felt as if something was missing, maybe chopped walnuts? It's wasn't bad and it wasn't great. I guess I was expecting more. Nonetheless, I will use what I made on pancakes in the coming days.

I always make this butter when I make popovers for a special breakfast.
