This is my recipe, and I'm sorry a couple of people have had trouble with it.  This isn't a beginner's recipe because you have to be careful not to overheat the frosting, and you have to beat it soooo long for it to get thick enough to spread.  If you don't beat it long enough, it will be gritty.  If you cook it too long, it will get too thick and be hard to spread.  The frosting is temperamental, but well worth it.  It isn't a rich buttery-looking caramel; it's more creamy and beige-colored.  I've been making this cake every Christmas for more than 20 years and I know it's difficult to make--I've had a few instances where the frosting was too runny or thick as a brick!  But when I take the time and pay attention to the details, it is absolutely fabulous.  I hope the other reviews don't dissuade you from giving it a try!

I am wondering if the reviewer that thought the caramel filling was too sweet used regular sugar. Powdered sugar makes it fine.

Very disappointing 'cause it soundes so delicious.  The cake was very yummy, I might make that part again. The caramel filling was just way over the top.  I don't know if there was maybe a misprint.  5 cups total sugar (and I did us confectioners suger and superfine, as directed)?  It was SUPER-sweet & very heavy.  Once cooled, it was not at all smooth like you'd expect caramel filling to be, but very gritty.  Trying to spread it tore apart the top of the cake.  I actually had to heat it up again so I could pour it over instead.  Not worth making again.

I just made this cake over the weekend. At first I was a bit apprehensive because of the reviews I read-several people stated they had trouble with it, particularly the caramel filling-and since I've never made anything with a caramel filling before, I wasn't sure how it would turn out. It DOES take a lot of patience and time, but it IS worth it!! What I did was, after I transferred the saucepan to the bowl of ice water and used the electric mixer for several minutes, I then transferred it into another bowl and placed that bowl in ice water and continued to beat w/the mixer. I kept adding ice cubes to the water and after a bit the filling thickened and was PERFECT. I will make this again!! :)

This was delicious but the texture was not quite right.  I think that if cooked to the soft ball stage it may have a better chance of sucess.  I used it with a  yellow butter recipe cake mix, it was good with chocolate icecream but it would have been better with chocolate cake too.

Holy cow yum!!!!!!! This review is of the caramel filling I needed a caramel filling for a birthday cake for my girlfriend. She does not like chocolate but love love loves caramel. So after reading some whiney reviews and the original posters remarks I decided to tackle this evil caramel recipe ;) I followed the directions to the "T" except instead of an ice bowl i filled my kitchen sink....I have a small kitchen, it was easier lol......so I was concerned at first because in the ice bath it wasnt setting up.....BE PATIENT!......I took a deep breath because i was happy with the somewhat gooey results it didnt run off the cake so yay.....let me tell you about 10 min of the mixture cooling after the hot hard work i came back to put it in a container a BAM low and behold I have caramel "margarine" (that was the consistency) PERFECTION for cake filling!!!!! I put it between the layers of the white chocolate cream cake recipe from this site and it was heaven!!! We had some left over and used it as waffle topping lol!!! I will keep this and use it again and again!!! Thank you for such an amazing recipe and thanks great aunt Lizzie!!!
