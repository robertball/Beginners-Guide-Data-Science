I grew up in an Asian household and we sure do love our soup! This was great once I made a few adjustments.  We really like a lot of broth (as we have it with noodles), so I increased the liquid to 5 cups chicken stock and 3 cups of water.  Even with that much liquid there was MORE then enough meat!  I mixed in 2 green onions into the meat mixture and a dash of black pepper. I skipped sauting the cabbage and added it into the simmering soup the last few minutes of cooking, we don't like it mushy.  As for the soup itself, if you add the meatballs in before it comes to a simmer, they will not fall apart.  The last couple minutes of simmering I added in 3 thinly sliced green onions, a large handful of sliced cilantro, and a bit more soy sauce to taste.  and DON'T SKIP THE SESAME OIL, this is key to the flavor.  The meat filling and broth would also be good for wonton soup!  Try adding in some sliced carrots or broccoli towards the end with the cabbage, very good!

This brings back childhood memories! For the meatballs, an easier way to make them is using a rounded "tablespoon" to make the shape easily as I dumped it one by one into the all chicken broth i a pot that had browned minced garlic. At the end of cooking everything, I added Lee Kum Kee brand of oyster sauce as needed at the end of cooking to add another dimension to the broth.  The reason I cooked the meat in the broth first prior to boiling is to allow the meat to have more total time cooking in the broth (total 15 mins).   After the meat has been in the simmering broth I added the stem parts  of the napa cabbage into the broth/meat since they take longer to cook compared to the leaves, cooked this for 5 mins. Then I added the napa cabbage leaves cooked this for 5 mins. This way parts of the cabbage wasn't overcooked in the one pot.

I make this often in the winter..but I do something just a little different..I bake it..I layer some cabbage leaves in the bottom of my ceramic cook pot, then put in the raw meat balls and then I pour over the liquid that I have heated to just boiling. Then I layer the rest of the cabbage with some fresh ginger and garlic slices. I simmer it for about 2-3 hours in a covered pot on 300'...Or you can make it in the morning and put it in the slow cooker all day..Yummy!

I made this tonite for the first time, and it won't be the last!  The only change I made was to use 3 cups of broth and 1 cup of water.  I was a worried the broth would be a little 'thin' for our taste if made as written. Kids and adults loved this soup equally.  This was immediately deemed a 'keeper' here.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!!

I just made some soup inspired by this recipe and a pork dumpling recipe. It's very good as a base, although just by looking at the proportions compared to what I just made it will be meat and cabbage heavy - as another reviewer mentioned you might want to add more broth/water to taste as you're going. I only had 1/2 a napa cabbage and 1/2 lb of pork. Mine could have used more broth as well (and that's with about 3 cups, for this I'd say total 6 cups broth/water). All in all very similar to this. Of all my changes I'd recommend adding the garlic powder and chinese five spice, browning the meatballs, and adding some vinegar to the broth.  For the meatballs I used 1/2 beaten egg, then whisked in 1 tbsp corn starch, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tsp sherry wine, 1 tsp grated fresh ginger, 1/2 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp chinese five spice. I mixed 1/2 lb pork, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 1 minced green onion in by hand. That made about 22 meatballs, I ended up only using 15 or so and froze the rest. To get a nice brown color, I placed them on lightly greased baking pan and left them be in the oven for 15 minutes at 400F.  My soup base was almost identical; I sauteed onion in one to one ratio with the cabbage (1/2 onion with 1/2 head of cabbage), then added a few sliced shittake mushrooms and sauteed until the liquid had simmered off. I added another tsp of ginger to the broth, as well as 1/2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 tbsp brown sugar, and a dash of allspice. Quite excellent! A das

This recipe is a keeper. I followed it exactly and it was great. The only thing I did different was use lean ground turkey instead of pork to cut fat. Usually things I make with the lean ground turkey are a bit firm and tough, but these dumplings were soft and pillowy. Really delicious. Thanks Lei Lei! Talk about easy cheap Chinese flavors.

I had to try this out tonight! Lions beat the Packers and just the Name alone was to add insult to injury to the hubby, who's a Packer fan in the family:( 
We LOVED! I used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of the 2 C. each of broth and water.
I also baked my pork balls. Just what we prefer.
Added more green onions and soy to our taste and some white ground pepper.
I also just chopped the Napa cabbage and put in the broth until done. Added the pork balls and simmered about 10 minutes.
Everything was so delicious! Loved all the flavors! We went back for seconds! 
Thank You So Much Lei Lei for sharing! Will be making again Very Soon! 
Oh! First time I ever bought Sesame Oil! I was shocked at the price! Wow!

I have been wanting to try this for a while and I'm so glad that I finally did! It is delicious. I accidentally put the sesame oil in the meat mixture. I went ahead and added some to the broth at the end too. It was perfect so I will do that again next time. After putting it all together, there did not seem to be enough broth. I added 4 more cups and that seemed to be more to our liking. The fresh ginger is a prominent taste and I love that about this soup.

Summer veggie co-op brings me an assortment of vegetables each week and finding recipes to use them all can be a challange.
I looked up Chinese cabbage and found this. I loved it,
Next time I will add some minced garlic and chili spice to the meatballs, but it was a nice change!

A really simple dish to prepare.  The only thing I did differently was boil it a bit longer, being somewhat paranoid about the doneness of my slightly oversized meatballs. The results were outstanding.  Everyone who tried it declared it "a keeper" and went back for a second bowl.

Great recipe.  I used ground turkey and bok choy.  Add 1.5 teaspoons of Chinese Five-spice in the last 3 minutes of cooking time.

The taste was wonderful and homey, but the proportions for the broth to other ingredients must be off. I would cut the amount of cabbage to half a head as long as the head of cabbage is small. That will make this a soup rather than a dish of meatballs in boiled cabbage.

I really liked this recipe.  It was really yummy, liked the hearty turkey meat balls that make the soup very filling.  It has great flavor as well.

Awesome!  I couldn't find napa cabbage,  so I used bok choy.  I did brown the meatballs first.  It was excellent.   Maybe a little too heavy on the salt.

Yum! Easy to make and even my kids liked it. I did add a clove of garlic each to the meat mixture and while sauteeing the cabbage. I reduced the ginger and sesame oil by half just because I tend to find those particular flavors a bit overpowering. Served with noodles. Next time I'll brown the meatballs first (my husband felt they were mushy) and add the sauteed cabbage at the end so it ends up a bit more crispy.

4 28 14 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/135367/chinese-lions-head-soup/ ... This is a good soup for summer - light, but filling.  I subbed 1t ground ginger for fresh & used homemade chicken broth.  Oh, no napa cabbage at the store so subbed a 10oz pkg frozen chopped spinach.  'Probably would've been prettier if I'd cooked the spinach separately so the broth wouldn't be green; but, hey, it's broth with chopped spinach in it.  Maybe it'd be green anyway.  :D  I only put 1t sesame oil at the end.  The 2t would've been fine, too.  'Just being careful. :)  'Think the meatballs could use more ginger, if using ground.

I thought this was good, but the guys thought this was GREAT! I used more broth/water than called for (about double), b/c I wanted to add rice noodles (I used an 8oz. pkg.). This was super simple to make and I thought the meatballs had good flavor, not too overpowering at all. The broth is a bit bland, but is easily fixed w/ salt, which brought out the flavors more. I'm assuming this is supposed to be a lightly flavored soup, but I'm sure can be easily adjusted to suit you tastes. All in all, this turned out fine, and will be a repeat! Thanks for sharing. :)

My family really enjoys this.  I've made it several times.  I use all broth, no water, and usually add some sliced carrots to up the vegetable intake (always a challenge with the kids).

Yummy. A little too much ginger though. I used beef broth and put in about 10-12 cups water/broth liquid though because there was so much meat. I also added some asian noodles and used ground turkey.

Not too bad but a little heavy on the sesame oil. I will play with it a bit next time but there will be a next time so that is a plus for me.

This is wonderful!  It was necessary for me to use ground turkey this time - but I am planning to make it, again,  this week, using ground pork.  I also added a little more scallion to the meatballs.  It is wonderful!  Healthy and delicious.  Thank you, so very much, for sharing this wonderful recipe.   So easy.

I love it!   Few changes I made: I use Tapioca instead of cornstarch so the ground pork isn't too dense / softer bite.  I made the balls a little bit bigger to retain the meat flavor; about the size of 2 tablespoon / 2 golf balls.  Also, I couldn't find good looking fresh Chinese cabbage during that time & I really want to have this soup so I substitute it with green beans.  I fried the green beans in medium heat with garlic, soy sauce & tofu until tofu is lightly brown roughly on all sides.  One last change I made is to not mix the ginger with the pork but rather slice them thinly & throw them in the pot with water & tomato wedges;  I added tomatoes because I want the soup to have a subtle hint of natural sour flavor on top of it's original flavor.  When I had my first bite, this turns out better than what I have anticipated!  Love this recipe and I'm adding this into my regular menu.  :)

Made this tonight with only a couple basic changes (of course eh?)  Added some lime zest to the pork mixture which seemed to add a little zest.   Broth we added way more than called for and it was definitely more than enough meat (4 cups chicken broth, 3 cups water).  Added a tablespoon of chili garlic sauce as well to up the heat and cut up orange and red peppers with chopped carrot.  Put 2/3 cup rice in a bowl and garnish with a dash of sesame oil and sriracha and its a big meal.  The base for the pork is perfect!  Thanks for sharing - it's a new fav.

I loved your light and flavorful soup. Thank You so much for your recipe. I would like to say I did not veer from the original recipe, but, I did not have any green onions, only leeks, so that is what I used. I will have green onions the next time I make it!!!

AWESOME!! I made this today SOOO good! I made the meatballs exactly as written. I increased broth to about 8 cups added 1tsp oyster sauce, napa cabbage, carrots, celery, green onion and mei fun noodles. I LOVE the flavors of chinese. food and this had an amazing combo of those flavors.  The flavors of ginger and sesame permeated the broth from the meatballs. Heavenly! I  NEVER thought I could make something that tasted like it came from a fine chinese restaurant, but today I did! THANKS FOR SHARING!!!!!!!!!!! (=

YUMMY!  Because I wanted to cut out fat I used ground turkey breast instead of the pork even though I know it is a different flavor.  I also used 6 cups chicken broth and no water.  I also thought a whole head of cabbage would be alot but not so.  I did not use MSG.  Next time I'm thinking of adding a little extra ginger and doubling the green onions.  I did serve with rice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was delicious. I had some extra produce to use up so I added it. I julienned some pea pods and baby carrots and added them to the cabbage. I also added some chopped cilantro to the meatballs. Garnished it with thinly sliced radish and more cilantro. Don't forget the sriracha if you like it spicy! Not sure if my additions took away from the recipe's authenticity, but it was still really good and a quick fix meal. A nice soup to clean out the fridge.

We all love it.  The flavor was a bit on the mild side.  The dish can be made with beef, hence the heavier flavor.

Love the simple ingredients; so satisfying & filling.  I substituted ground turkey for pork which worked out perfectly.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly except I did add a couple cloves of minced garlic when I sauteed the cabbage.  Will definitely make again and again ...

This is good. Its the same ingredients that my father used except he would make the pork droppings really large. We're not of chinese descent but my father loved to cook chinese food. Everytime I make this it reminds me of Dad since he passed away in 1992

Easy and excellent, but as others suggested I 1) baked the meatballs for about 25 minutes as I made them too big (will do better next time), and 2)added more chicken broth and water.  10/19/2109.

This was very good.  It makes a ton!  The pork meatballs are very tasty.  I fried them first, removed them, continued with the rest of the recipe and added them back in with the other ingredients. I also added 2 more cups of chicken broth as I like a little more liquid.  I made some rice on the side and added it at the table for those who wanted it and that was another reason I wanted a little more chicken broth.

My family loved this! I added some shitake mushrooms to the cabbage while the broth was cooking, and some snow peas a little bit before serving. Also, I baked the meatballs before adding them to the broth. Thank you for this recipe!

I made the recipe as written except for the MSG.  I didn't have any. I mistakenly grated my ginger vice mincing it but no mind. After reading the other reviews, I only used 1/2 of a Napa cabbage.  So, only 1 pound. Anyway, simply loved the flavors. The pork balls add a decadent richness that you probably can't get if you use another meat. It came together easily and the flavors were great. I served it with sticky rice.

This recipe made my husband love cabbage... NOT an easy task! We searched for a way to use Napa Cabbage from our CSA because it is not something we normally eat. We made this soup 2 weekends in a row and we hope there is more Napa Cabbage in the next CSA box. We made minor adjustments like omitted MSG and red pepper (food sensitivities), doubled ginger,  add shiitake mushrooms, add rice noodles, add snap peas. This soup is one of our all time favorites. Not enough stars to properly rate this!

Delicious! I made mine with 3 cups chicken stock and 1 cup water and I added about a teaspoon of garlic to the pork mix. Next time I think I'll add a bit more cornstarch to the mix so I can get the fluffy ball look.

A quick soup to go with the stir-fry lunch. I did add a tad more broth and less water as I found it 'watery' at first. I love just throwing the meatballs in the broth to cook! so simple.

I didn’t use cornstarch because I didn’t have anyway so used about 1/8 cup of plain bread crumbs. It worked fine. I also used sesame oil in the meatballs as well as the soup at the end and it turned out amazing!  I will make this over and over again!

It was pretty good. But this isn't really Lion's Head Soup. It's more like meatball soup. For it to be Lion's Head Soup, the meatball should actually be like 5-10 times bigger than these. Also it would be preferable to fry the meatball before boiling it. However, this was pretty good and fragrant. Pretty good for winter nights.

Excellent meatball recipe. I’ve used ground turkey. I make one ounce meatballs and cook in simmering broth for 7 minuets. Meatballs freeze great!

When I made this last night, forgot to put salt in the meat balls. It definitely needs it.  I used only chicken broth and  doubled the amount of liquid.  We did not like the texture of the meat balls thinking if I make again I will try to bake them and hope it doesn't change the flavor f the soup.

This was delicious! I am Taiwanese, and I've never been able to make soups like my mom... my Asian soups generally taste bland and like salty water. I followed this recipe almost exactly, except I didn't have napa so I used sliced cucumber.  It turned out SO well, and like something my mom would make! Will definitely make again (many times).

Great recipe.  We added some Korean red pepper into both the meatballs and the broth to add some spice.  Also nearly doubled the ginger.  Ended up adding a lot more stock and water.  It was delicious

This was a hit! Did not add the MSG, just added a handful of soba noodles once the soup started boiling, just before adding the meat balls. It was a complete meal.

My family loves lion's head soup   and we really enjoyed this recipe. I'm on a heart healthy diet, so my version isn't exactly "traditional". I usually use ground turkey instead of pork, add more veggies such as carrots and daikon, and reduce the sodium and no MSG. As others have suggested, I also add 6-8 cups of water to make it more of a soup. Sesame oil is essential to give it the right flavor. Goes great with rice or as a broth for noodle soup.

This soup is so good! I made the meatballs with ground turkey, and while they were tasty, I think next time I'll go with pork for the added savory flavors. Baking them beforehand also cut down on simmer time/released extra fat. I forgot to add the ginger to the meatballs but putting it in the broth was equally tasty!

I liked the soup and will make it again. The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I thought there was too much ginger in the meatballs.  I also added more broth once I saw the meatball to soup ratio I felt like it needed it.

I love this soup. Even my young kids love it. But I do change it a bit. First of all,  I fry up the meatballs instead of the cabbage. Sometimes I also add carrots at this stage. I do add almost twice the amount of liquid. And I use all chicken stock. No water. And I add a bit of Chinese 5 spice also.  I use whatever cabbage I have. Chinese,  Bok Choy, whatever. I fry up the ends with the meatballs and the leaves go in at the end.  We really do enjoy this recipe.

Thanks for the inspiration!
My modifications based on other reviewers suggestions:
-Increased liquids to 5 cups broth and 3 cups water
-Prepped pork mix.  With cookie spoon, dropped balls into boiled liquids.  Simmer for 5 minutes
-Added 2 sliced carrots and thicker stalk of cabbage to liquid.  Simmer for 5 minutes
-Finally, added 1 cup sliced mushrooms and rest of cabbage to liquid. 
Chock full of vegetables and delicious!

Loved it! My daughter said this tasted like one from our favorite noodle restaurants. We used a little bit of cabbage but to compromise, we added 8oz of rice noodles. Since we were using noodles, we had to add more broth (around 8 cup total). I used a mixture of wonton soup base and regular chicken broth due to availability. Also, I'm not a fan of sesame oil, so I adjusted by using 3/4 teaspoon in the meat mixture and I think 1/2 teaspoon into the broth.

I really enjoyed this soup, it's simple, fast (I didn't saute the cabbage as one reviewer suggested) and very delish! I plan to try it with turkey ground rather than pork next time.

really really good!   for those who aren't used to sesame oil, drizzle on sparingly after pouring in the bowl to serve. Taste, and then add as desired.  my husband liked the taste but thought it was a little strong.

I love the flavor of this soup. I used the ingredients as stated. I combined some of the tips...like sauteing the chunkier pieces of cabbage. I made this on the stove top. I love the flavor of the broth and the flavor of the meatballs. What I didn't really like was the texture of the meatballw. They were not tender and they weren't over cooked. I might try making them smaller like I would for albondigas soup. I may in fact add a little cornmeal and a little milk and use just the egg yolk to bind them next time.  And I will definitely make again. Great recipe just need to tweak those meatballs and I agree w/ other comments there is more than enough meat. You could reduce it by a 1/3 to 1/2 and it would still be delicious.

I adore this recipe. My friend made it for me once and I LOVED it so I had to make it myself. This is fantastic! The meatballs are pretty gingery, but I love that. This is a regular recipe for me now, and I love it best with some rice that I just throw into my bowl with it. Yum!

An absolutely FABULOUS recipe esp. for hesitant soup makers! You can't go wrong with this one. Definitely hits the spot on a cold winters day! I substituted ground turkey and added more onions to the meatballs. I also added (as one reviewer did) a handful of cilantro at the end and more broth and that made it amazing. This is a keeper.  I would give it a 5 but I almost think the meatballs need a little more umph!...maybe garlic or cilantro.

This soup was amazing! My family just loved it. I made a couple changes, but think they made it better. I browned the meatballs before putting them in the broth. I simmered it longer than reccomended. Also I added more broth and didnt use any water.I also cut up raw won ton wrappers and threw them in. It tasted like won ton soup. I will be making this alot these upcoming fall and winter months!!

I just made this soup today and it wasnt quite what I expected.....I found that there wasn't alot of flavor in the broth howecer the meat contained more so. I also found that my meat balls didnt want to stay together that well making the appearance not so appealing. My suggestions if I made again I would add more stock, and probably use bread crumbs or oats to make a heartier filler for the meat balls.

I make ALOT of soups and chowders during the winter, and this is one of my favorites! I leave out the msg and it's still just as yummy. I have also used the pork to fill wonton wrappers and dropped them into the hot soup, which is delicious! I look forward to making this in the fall...yum!

I made this soup for my finicky family.  It was a hit. I used 6 cups liquid and had a huge head of savoy so I only used 2/3 of it.  I also used ground turkey breast instead of pork.  The soup was delicious, we will definately have it again.
