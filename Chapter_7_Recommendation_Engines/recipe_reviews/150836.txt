I tried only the topping, and put it on a different sweet potato pie recipe. It was delicious--very light and fluffy, and toasted to a gorgeous light brown. It was extremely sweet though, so next time I'll cut back the sugar in the filling of the pie. My husband put this on his top 5 best pies list, even though it was the first sweet tato pie I've ever made!

5 stars for the pie itself if it were made in a regular crust.  1 star for the meringue topping.  Sorry.  Unless you are going to serve this immediately, the meringue with the marshmallows in it is just too chewy and sticky.  Mine split also.  Will try the pie on a regular crust with a regular meringue topping to see if I have any better luck.

This recipe is fantastic! I usually stick with the highly reviewed recipes to be safe but I went ahead and gave this one a try. I'm glad I did! This is my favorite way to eat sweet potatoes. It's nice and sweet, almost like a sweet potato casserole.

This was a fun pie to make! It was far too sweet for me, so I think I'd like to play with it a little and use a pastry crust and less melted marshmallow in the topping. The filling is delicious. I scorched my first pot of marshmallows, by the way; it's best to get the egg whites going, and then stand at the stove stirring constantly because those suckers melt fast! I baked the pie for about half an hour at 400, but the crust was getting pretty dark, so I reduced the temp to 350 and probably baked it about an hour total. I filled a piping bag with about a third of the meringue, spread the rest on the still-warm pie, and then piped marshmallowy blobs around the edge. I baked the meringue topping at 350, too, for about 15 minutes. Oh, I'd also like to try using one egg and two egg yolks in the pie filling, because I like it when recipes use up all parts of the egg. I'll make this again, with tweaks.

Having a hard time rating this recipe.  First the graham cracker crust I left out the mace as we do not like the spice.  At a quarter teaspoon it might not be a huge deal but did not want to take a chance.  The actual pie filling is definitely a five star filling, we loved it.  The marshmallow meringue great the first day but all the pie did not get eaten and on the second day it was more like eating a stale PEEP Easter candy.  I will make the pie without the meringue I think and therefore am giving this three stars so that people who have never tried sweet potato pie will maybe give this one a try.

Followed the recipe for filling except added nutmeg and a bit of ginger instead of mace. Came out great!
