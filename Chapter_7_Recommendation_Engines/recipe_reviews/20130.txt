This is delicious but it is time-consuming to make.  Also, the recipe makes more than a 9X13 pan can hold.  I had an additional 9X9 pan full.  If you've got the time, this is worth it!  Tastes even better as a "left over."

This is soo ymuuy!  I made this a low-carb version (or just lower carb, depending on what "stage" you're on) by omitting the rice all together, and also the carrots.  I added an additional can of artichokes to soak up the soup, since there was no rice.  Tasty!  I could have taken out the onions, but they add so much flavor to a recipe!

This was so yummy! All my favorites in one!  1 child liked it, the other...doesn't like anything. What can you do?  I halved the recipe and it just fit in my 11" round baking dish (1 1/2" deep). I substituted rice with brown rice (what I had on hand) & it worked great!

I've made this several times, with great success and rave reviews.  I've also doubled the recipe and frozen some, this works well.  Be sure you have enough wild rice (the packages are deceiving) and don't substitute the "brown and wild rice" mix.  Using all wild rice really makes the recipe. It's a lot of work (not hard, just time-consuming), but worth it!

My family gave this recipe a 5 star rating.  I doubled easily for my big family and also had to improvise with a coupld of things.  I had 1 family sz cream of chicken soup and added a family sz cream of mushroom soup, also added 1 t. sweet paprika and 1 t. thyme.  I didn't have mozz cheese so I used an italian blend of cheeses I had on hand.  I also used the cooking directions on the package of wild rice, also I only had matchstick carrots which cooked perfectly. Also, instead of 1 cup of butter to cook the onions and mushrooms I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 bacon drippings. Everyone asked for the recipe and the kids ate it up too!  I will make this again by request I'm sure and I will add more bacon.  This would be good over fetticini too....next time  :)

This is exactly what I was looking for! I've been searching for a chicken and rice casserole, but others that I have tried have been too bland. I substituted cream of chicken soup with herbs for some extra flavor and sour cream for the heavy cream for a little more depth. Came out delicious! Fit perfectly in my 9 x 13 baking pan - I'm not sure what the other user's issue was with that. I will definitely make this recipe again - yummy comfort food!

This was not a favorite with us. The flavor was pretty good, but the texture was mushy and a little unappealing. I didn't add the carrots because I thought they would be a strange flavor to add to this kind of casserole, but I can't imagine that they would have made a huge difference in the turnout. Probably won't make this again. Thanks anyway, though!

Served this at a ladies luncheon yesterday. It went over nicely. Everyone loved it! I counted on it being a little on the bland side, so I prepared it with Cream of Chicken Dijon, added more sherry, and water chestnuts. Very Good! Thanks Eden.

I had so much hope for this recipe!  Didn't like the sauce and the texture was mediocre.  Pass on this one!

This casserole dish was so tasty!  I honestly didn't know how to prepare julienned carrots so I just used shredded and thought it worked just fine.  I agree with an earlier review that it makes more than a 9"x13" can hold.   My husband and I have been fighting over the leftovers at lunchtime!

Sorry, but my husband and I did not like this at all. I love artichokes and chicken so I was really excited about this, but we did not care for the flavor. I think maybe I just didn't like the chicken soup flavor? Or maybe canned artichokes? I'm not quite sure what it was, but we will not be making this again.

This dish was awesome!  Though I did it a little different. I preseasoned the chicken with seasonings of my own preference.  I only used one jar of artichokes. Then I used pre-packaged bacon pieces (because I didn't have any bacon) yet I used bacon grease to pre-cook the chicken with & saute the veggies with.  I then put parmesean & breadcrumbs on the top. It was delicious!

I am so glad to find this recipe! I made it literally hundreds of times in the 90s. I discovered the recipe in a Jr. League cookbook that's long since disappeared. My catering shop made it often because it was a good, lower cost buffet alternative to expensive, labor-intensive hors d'oeuvres or a sit-down affair

I agree this does make  more than a 13x9, more like two of them.  Next time I will add a sausage, little garlic, and maybe even some red bell pepper.  The carrots need to be a little precooked or they are still little hard.  I will also cut the carrots up into bit size pieces.  Although the carrots are small to begin with they still did not cook to be soft all the way through.

I liked this recipe more than my husband did, but I'm more of a rice eater than he is.  The soup I used was an organic cream of chicken soup from Sprouts, and it is not very thick (like the popular commercial one is that has MSG in it).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe except that I cooked my Wisconsin rice in chicken broth rather than water.  I would make this again, but I'd have to cut it back because I might be alone in this meal!  :)  Thanks, GUEMES!
