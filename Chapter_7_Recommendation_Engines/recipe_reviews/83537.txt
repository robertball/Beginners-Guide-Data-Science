Rich and delicious for an occasional splurge.

I wish people would stop rating recipes on ingredients or health-consciousness alone - it's really annoying, we're all old enough to see it's not healthy and not for everyday, for Pete's sake!!!

Wow - "Super Cheesy" alright! This is definitely not for the health conscious or for those counting calories! I don't even want to know how many calories or fat grams are in this because it was just so darn cheesy, buttery, and just plain good. I mean we're talkin' delish with a capital "D" here.  I used Hellman's light mayo and reduced fat cheese just so I wouldn't feel too bad about eating so much of this. My husband and I devoured this - can't wait to make it again! Not too soon though as I'd like to fit into my clothes... Thanks for a great recipe STEFANY21!

Wouldn't have this often as it's heavy and rich and clearly not the best nutrition-wise either. But as an occasional splurge in small portions this was a mouth-watering, gooey, cheesy treat to accompany our main dish salad tonight. With the exception of cutting back on the mayonnaise significantly, I followed the recipe fairly closely, eyeballing ingredients and sprinkling the cheese with ground pepper before broiling.

This recipe was PERFECT!!! I wasn't sure about using it at first, only because there was no ratings posted.  I am glad I did though this recipe is one I plan on using again.  My family LOVED it!!

OMG!  I am not a health freak, but this almost stopped my heart half way through!  A stick of butter and 3/4 cup mayo?  Tasted way to heavy on the stomach.  I could eat one piece as a meal and be good for a day or two.

Killer bread. I followed the recipe exact, only sprinking a little red pepper flake on the grownup's side. I didn't much care for the main dish, but I sure ate my fill of this bread! No leftovers!

This bread is so awesome.  Use whatever cheese(s) you like.  I omit the green onions as our family doesn't like them.  I use garlic salt insted of minced garlic (just my preference).  When we have dinner guests, this is usually on the menu by their request.  Everyone loves this bread, even people who don't like mayo. Btw, someone rated this 2 stars because of the ingredients.  Why give a bad rating without trying the recipe just because of the calorie content?  That's insane.  If it's not for you, move on, don't rate the recipe low. This bread is DELISH!

This was FANTASTIC!! I made it with French Baguettes from this site; perfect together! I was a little worried when I was mixing it all together - thought it would be way too rich and too much topping too, but the flavor was really terrific, a very good mix and the broiling was the perfect touch, and it spread on thick but thins out when it bakes, yummy! :)

This recipe is delicious, although I make it with equal parts butter and mayo and add more garlic than called for.

This is fantastic... I have to be honest and admit that I just measured the ingredients by eye and spread the sauce on hotdog buns I was trying to use up.  The results were amazing! I can't wait to follow the recipe and use a quality bread. ;) This is a must try!

This is a great recipe. I used chives instead of onions because that's what I had. But I think it would be great with the onions as well. Next time I will sprinkle a small amount of garlic powder on top before baking for a little more garlic flavor. That is not to say that this recipe is not great as written because it is!

I thought there was a bit too much mayo.  Next time I will only use half the amount.  I also added some oregeno.  Nice Touch.

This was very good.  Definitely our go to garlic bread recipe.  I do omit the onions though.  And watch this in the oven, it it overflows onto the bottom it will smoke like crazy.  Trust me.  ;)

try mixing olive oil with the butter and using sour cream instead of mayonnaise, totally fabulous and you are lightening some of the calories, also try lite sour cream

DELICIOUS! Be warned...it's VERY rich, but oh so good. I made the recipe exactly as written, but I sliced my bread into slices and toasted one side under the broiler and flipped it over. I slathered the un-toasted side with the cheesy, creamy mixture and broiled it until brown and bubbly. I took the leftovers to my sister's house, and they loved it too! This would be wonderful with soup or a big salad. I know I'll be using this recipe again and again! Thanks for posting. :)

Holy cow....heavy on the tummy, but gooey, cheesy and garlicky is the best way to enjoy garlic bread! Next time, I'll just eyeball all the ingredients, as I don't think flavor will be sacrificed at all by drastically reducing the butter and mayo, and I love butter and mayo! I used some minced garlic as well as a healthy sprinkling of garlic and onion powders. Didn't have green onions, so I used dried chives, which I'd do again. Also, I didn't have a loaf of french bread, so out of sheer desperation, I used a package of King's Hawaiian rolls sliced lengthwise. I slathered up both sides and forged on with the recipe. Not bad in a pinch, but I'll make sure to have a loaf of french bread on hand next time I make this! Served with AR's Hearty Minestrone soup, this sinfully delicious garlic bread was thoroughly enjoyed by myself, hubby, and 4 year-old daughter. An occasional splurge for sure, I'll hold on to this recipe.

Really good but I cut down on the mayo (about 1/2 c of LITE mayo), and used margarine instead! Made it somewhat healthier and was still delish!

This garlic bread is delicious! I used to buy frozen garlic bread every week for pasta night, and I realized I was wasting a lot of money. This is so easy and SO much better than anything you'll ever buy frozen!

All I can say is awesome! I took the recommendation of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup each of mayo and butter.  The cheese I used was a mix of shredded Colby and Monterey Jack as well as the Parm.  Yum!

You do not need the butter, the mayo has enough oils and fat to to the job. Also place a few slices of fresh or jarred jalpeno in.  Can use on any fish as well, replace the butter with more parm. cheese, will make any dry fish very moist and tasty!

This was very good! The only change I would make next time, is to leave out the onions. It way over powered the cheese and garlic flavor. Will make again!

There was a wonderful restaurant in Tucson called Chads. They made this on French bread brushing it first with buttermilk. That would eliminate the need for mayo. Then use any cheese that you like. This recipe as is I've been making for years using Banguette. Perfect appetizer that way or on French with supper. This is such a keeper. Don't miss tryng this one.

My family of teens and adults absolutely raved about this bread! I made the whole recipe as directed but used only half of it for a long skinny loaf of French bread. I'll use the other half for dinner tomorrow night as my family asked me to make it again! One loaf served 5 with some having seconds.

Can you say Claim Jumper?  This recipe reminded me of that over-the-top, your heart's going to stop if you eat one more bite kind of thing that you get at that restaurant.  If you love that, then you'll love this.  I'm all about over-the-top, so I loved it.  My daughter and husband found it to be a little too much.  Even I am willing to concede this is a recipe saved for rare occasions unless an early grave is what you wish!

This was good....but I almost felt like it was missing something.  I think next time I will add a little more garlic.  It also was very heavy.  I made it with soup, but next time I think I will make it with some sort of pasta dish and add a little more flavor.

This bread was a huge hit at my house. I'll be honest I'm not much of a cook but pairing this with the slow-cooker lasagna I make, and everyone was impressed! I just have to take a second to say, I DO NOT get the people writing bad reviews because it's not healthy. I know you are all smart enough to have realized that before you made it, if you did even make it (and if you didn't, you shouldn't be reviewing it anyway). If something this heavy, rich (ie delicious) makes you have a heart attack just thinking about it, move on, go find a recipe for tofurkey or something. 

This recipe was EXCELLENT. Yum! I did make a few tweaks to it though. I used a 1lb Italian loaf from the local grocer. Omitted the onions. I did use the 1/2 c. of butter, but I cut the mayo down to 1/2 c. as well. I added in 1/2 t. of garlic powder along with the 3 cloves of minced garlic, and I think next time I'll even add in maybe a 1/2 t. of garlic salt. For the cheese I used 1 c. of cheddar, 1 c. of mozzarella, 1/2 c. of a shredded Italian mix, and then another 1/4 c. of shredded parm. I wasn't sure how it would turn out mixing everything together and spreading it on instead of starting with the butter, then putting mayo on, followed by a cheese topping. Mixing it all together was great and had the same or better result than layering it all on individually. This recipe was simple and delicious. Yes, it's a little decadent, but we could all use that sometimes.

I made this to go with a spaghetti dinner and it's incredibly delicious. Even my super picky son inhaled it. I only wish I wasn't so full so I could eat more of it. (I substituted shredded mozzarella for the Monterey jack and didn't have scallions. I also added black pepper, dried oregano and dried basil.)

This was delicious!  Only thing I probably did differently was to add more garlic and green onions. That's it! This is the only way I'll make garlic bread now.

This was good, but a tad too rich for my taste with all the butter and mayo. I like rich and cheesy so it has tons of potential. One could probably cut back on the butter and 1/4-1/2 cup on the mayo and it would not be missed. Also it was a bit salty with cheese, mayo and salted butter. So I recommend using unsalted butter.

I tried this. Amazing amazing!!! Followed it right to the letter. It's perfect the way it is. I am sure it will go over well for any party cut into bite size pieces. Yes, it's heavy, but I'm sure it will go a long way with my friends and family. Great with spaghetti and sauce. Love it!

I've made this recipe for a party and for company and both times everyone raved about it and it was the first thing to go. I made it as posted. You could probably tweak the amount of butter or mayo and it would probably be just as good. Don't miss this one. Everyone wanted the recipe after trying it.

Woah...this is RICH!  Definitely not for the health conscious!  I think one whole loaf of French bread is a little much because with this as rich and fatty as it is, a small slice goes a long way.  I did add a little garlic salt along with the minced garlic.  This is really tasty right out of the oven but again, a little goes a LONG way.

the best cheesiest garlic bread around.  I really wanted to make this, but didn't have a french loaf, so I mixed all the ingredients and just put it on old hamburger and hot dog buns....super awesome!  thanks Stef for a recipe that my family went cuckoo over!

Wow! Worth the calories for a special treat. My fresh French bread was to soft so next time I halved bread(per recepie) then sliced each half loaf 3/4 way through for individual slices,about 5 per half loaf, then put it in the oven first to heat it up so bread was warm and a little firmer in the middle.Take it out, add topping and return to oven following recepie.  It turned out great!!

This was awesome!!!! I used whole wheat pita bread. I used miracle whip (we were at in-laws & that is all they had) and eye balled all my ingredients. For 1 pita which I cut into 4 slices, I'd say I used 2tbs butter and 2 tbs miracle whip and seasoned to our tastes. No green onion so used italian seasoning. I will always make this with pasta instead of boring garlic and butter toast.

Soooooo good!!! Made the recipe as is; could cut down on butter, I think, without losing the deliciousness.

Delicious, rich bread! If you're looking for a super cheesy, full of flavor garlic bread, look no further! It is heavy, but it's supposed to be and we loved this, I ate more bread than our pasta dish last night. All the flavors blended very well.  I will use this again for sure, I can't wait to try it out on company :)

We really didn't like the mayo in this.... gave an odd tangy taste to it, and took away from the garlic and cheese. Won't make again.

This bread was FANTASTIC!  Made it with lasagna tonight and husband and kids raved.  I cut the recipe in half for a long, thin loaf of French bread and it was plenty.  This is totally going into the rotation at my house!

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and I'm back again to make it this week. I look forward to this recipe every year! There is never any leftovers of these.  My kids always request this bread but It's only allowed on Thanksgiving.

This recipe is quick, easy and foolproof.  My husband is a really picky eater and he loved this version of garlic bread, and suggested I make it for our even pickier friends the next time they visit. I followed the recipe exactly as shown.

This was amazing!  I used a 16oz french baguette but will probably use bread with more 'bread' next time (if that makes sense??).  The topping seemed like a lot but it really sank into the bread and was just delicious.  I used unsalted butter, but added a couple turns of salt to the mixture.  Also used Mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack and chives instead of green onion (only because I had chives).  I will make this again and again!

Iv been making this for years, I originally got it from a church cookbook. But for the recipe I have, you put the spread on each half of the bread, Then wrap each half in Saran Wrap and chill it for a few hours (or over night). Iv tried it both ways and chilling it is the best. It puffs when you bake it and the over all texture is better!

This is the best! If you're worried about the fat content, use low fat ingredients - there really isn't that much difference in taste to not give it a try.

This was a huge hit. It doesn't even need dip. All my guests were begging me to tell them why it was so moist, I didn't think they wanted to know the secret ingredient is mayonnaise.

I had made garlic cheesy bread similar to this about 20 years ago, so I was happy to see this one. I made this today on a whim and discovered if you're in a pinch, dried chives work as long as you reconstitute them in the Mayo before putting everything together. Pretty good recipe!

This was amazing!!! This was the first thing I made on here and it went really well with my parmesean Chicken. The garlic cloves were a tad much imo, I think it would've turned out even better if I would've used garlic salt instead.

Reminds me of cheesy-garlic bread from a certain steak house.  Not health food but so good on occasion.  I think you could cut down on butter and mayo and still be good.

I loveddddd this!! It is super cheesy and rich, definitely a hit! I got the $1 French bread from Walmart and it was so delicious. I enjoyed the richness and flavors of the bread, I was full after two slices! I used light mayo which made me feel a little bit healthier. My mom said if you add some pepperoni and serve with a salad it would be a delicious pizza! Thank you!

Excellent, a whole bunch of green peppers was a little too much for me would cut this in half next time.
I left half the topping covered in the fridge so i could quickly make the second half of bread fresh to eat with my left overs.

I like my garlic bread  crispy. A thick layer of spread on the bread would make it soft on the surface.
So, I used half  the cheese spread's ingredients   and it was plenty gooey and cheesy, without loosing the crunch. Also seasoned with some salt and pepper.

This combo of ingredients was fabulous! Got to use your common sense on this one, though. Think about it. If you are only doing 1 loaf of bread as I was  the quantities are a little much. I used, 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup butter, and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (no other cheese with it), along with the other ingredients and it was amazing!! Will definitely make this one again!!

Wow, this is fabulous!  Unbelievably good.  I made exactly as written except I didn't have green onions so I used chives instead.  Definitely not low fat, but if you're wanting low fat chances are you're not going to be making garlic bread anyway.  Very nice to make for company-1 or two pieces per person is a good portion since it's so rich.  Will definitely be making again!

This was absolutely delicious! A couple of things I did differently...I used 1 1/2 cups of shredded Colby-Jack cheese and 5 oz container of shredded Parmesan cheese. I used all of the other ingredients as recommended. My French bread was previously frozen and halfway thawed out before I cut it and added the cheesy garlic topping. I may have let mine remain in the broil phase an extra 2 minutes (until the cheese started lightly browning). The family LOVED IT! My 9-year-old daughter and 66-year-old grandmother both asked for the recipe!

Only change was cheddar instead of jack and omitted the green onions.   Best bread I've ever made!

VERY GOOD.  Used 2 cups of Jack cheese and used 1 1/2 cups of Parmesan cheese, and 5 garlic.  A little salty.  Maybe use
unsalted butter next time or just put in less cheese and follow the amount from the recipe.

Reduced the recipe to two servings and put on a small split gluten free baguette. Wow! I dipped this in some leftover pasta sauce. It was a wonderful lunch.

A family hit and a must have for any Italian dinner nights!  Only modifications I made was cut the butter in half and used a mixture of Mayo and Sour Cream vs straight Mayo.  I used Italian seasoning in place of the onions and threw in a hand-full of Mozzarella cheese to the mix.  So cheesy and flavorful.

Concept is good but WAAAAY too much fat. The second time I made it I used 1/4 c butter, 2 T olive oil and 2 - 3 T mayo. The mayo was still overpowering. I will cut it down more or omit altogether.

OH MY!  I knew this would be rich and be well received by my family....but they inhaled it!  I didn't hear any chewing!  I cut most of the ingredients in half and still found it to be satisfying and hearty!  Was a delicious side to my home made chicken soup.

I've been making this for years. My mother-in-law gave me the recipe but she calls it Monterey Bread. I don't usually have green onions on hand so don't use them and I use lots of garlic powder and whatever cheese I have on hand. My kids love it and we never have leftovers!

Awesome!  Really easy & makes a lot.  I used half of the topping one night and about 3 days later used the other half of the topping on some leftover burger buns.  Yum!

My dinner guests loved this recipe, but I did change some quantities though: I only used 1/2 stick of butter, and it was still very tasty and not too greasy, and I didn't use the whole bunch of onions, about 1/2. I also added about 1/2 tsp. of dried oregano, which I love and everyone really liked the flavor.

Had this with bbq ribs. It was amazing! I am not a mayo fan, so we used a little less than it called for. And, I forgot to get the onions at the store, so I threw in some chopped fresh parsley instead. So So good. I dont know if I will ever make cheese bread another way again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very, very rich.  My guests liked it, but, I prefer a plain garlic bread.  I served it with spaghetti & meatballs and thought it overpowered the already heavy meal---I think it would work better with a lightly flavored soup (or something like that).

This was really satisfying. I was looking for something a little richer than your standard toasted butter with parmesan cheese on top of bread. My family really enjoyed this with the angel hair pasta I made tonight .... they asked for more....

This is amazing! I didn't have any green onions, but it still turned out amazing!  Instead of making a mixture though; I did layers with the butter on bottom, mayo, then cheese.  It made a nice little kick in the middle.  My favorite!
