I really loved this recipe very easy, low fat, moist.  A little bland, but the next time I fix it I am going to add cinnamon and raisins.  I think that will jazz it up a bit.  Thanks Star

We actually made this bread as part of homeschooling...we needed to make something with barley so I thought this looked quick and easy...which it was.  However we were pleasantly surprised at how GOOD it was though!  SOOOOO yummy!  My kids (ages 5 and 3) and hubby couldn't get enough of it.  We may have made this for a project, but it will become a staple quick bread around this house!  Only thing we did differently was to substitute half the white sugar with brown sugar.

I changed so much about this, that some may say it isn't even the same recipe!  I used soy milk instead of buttermilk, 1/2 cup honey instead of the sugar, baking powder instead of the baking soda, and whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose kind.  I baked it in a 9" pie pan for 1/2 hour.  It is great bread! So whether this is a true review or not, I'm thankful for the recipe!

This is very good, and forgiving; I forgot the baking soda (horrors) and, 5 minutes into baking, took the thing out of the oven and stirred it in...still came out fine.  I used fake buttermilk (1.25 tsp lemon juice left in the milk for 10 mins on the counter) and the bread was nice and moist because of soaking the cereal in milk.  Good with honey or on its own, and _very_ easy to work with.

An easy, delicious, and moist bread. It's a favorite of people at our church, my brother and his wife, and our neighbors. If your kids don't like it, perfect! That just means there's more healthy, yummy bread left for the adults to enjoy. Great for breakfast, especially with marionberry butter.

This would be good for a brunch where several people can eat the loaf. No one ate it at my house  and I had to throw 1/2 of it away. My children did not hate it, but they did not attack it like they do most of my quick breads.  They did not eat the pieces they had. This was just an average recipe.

I made this into 12 big muffins. It is really, really good. You can't taste the Grape Nuts that much, which is a bit unfortunate, but the overall texture is a bit more coarse than regular quick breads. I put blueberries in it. Yum!

Very nice.  Hubs insisted it smelled and tasted like bananas.  I told him there were no bananas in it but he argued with me about it.  I made something else with bananas today, so perhaps his taste buds were shot.  I didn't think it tasted like bananas at all.  I did use vanilla sugar . . .well, because I had it.  Everything else I left the same.  I thought this turned out to be a nice, dense bread with a light sweetness.  It worked well as a complement to the carrot soup we had for dinner.  I did make in crocks to make big muffins, and ended up with 4 large muffins that baked for 40 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very easy to make. I was in such a rush, I threw everything together exactly as the recipe called. Very good for breakfast. Next time I might add dried cranberries or apples. Thank you for sharing

Nice and moist -- very easy.  I was short on time and only let the cereal soak for 30 minutes, and it still seemed to come out fine.

This bread is absolutely wonderful.  Very versatile.  I tried using half wheat flour, half white flour and it turned out just as tasty.
