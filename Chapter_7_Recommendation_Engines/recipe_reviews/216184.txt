Delicious just like my moms recipe, though instead of evaporated milk and water I just used normal milk in the amount of total liquid which worked quite well

This mac-n-cheese was wonderful!  My husband could be a macaroni and cheese critic and he said this recipe was definitely a keeper.  One recommendation though is to add A LOT more cheese!  I didn't measure how much we used but I would say I at least tripled what the recipe called for.  Other than that this recipe was perfect!

I dont get all the hype about this. I have tried so many mac and cheese recipes and this does not get a top 10 for me. It doesn't turn out nearly as creamy as the picture makes it look, in fact kind of dry. The evaporated milk or something gave it a little bit of a bitter taste. I doubled the cheese because it didn't begin to cover the noodles. Not anything special. Definetly add more milk, double the cheese, and make sure the sauce isn't too thick and gooey.

I was a little skeptical that a recipe from Carnation would be fantastic but I was wrong. This was really great and I've made lots of different recipes for Mac n cheese. I used a full box of elbow macaroni (Barilla, 16 oz),  doubled the rest of the ingredients  except the cheese, which I tripled. I used 2  1.75 quart dishes so that I could take these to work for a potluck and heat in a microwave.  This was really good.  You can eat it w/o going through the baking step easily (i ate plenty from the pot this way and it was delish!)  But if you like the browned cheese topping, definitely throw in the oven.  I will be using this recipe again as it was easy and inexpensive.

This was a good recipe.  My husband liked it a lot, but I will probably make the following changes next time:  More cheese (probably 3 cups), more noodles (probably 2 or 2.5 cups), and I probably won't bake it... it tasted better before it was baked, I thought.

This is great! I changed it by skipping the bakings step entirely for the sake of time--the pasta sauce thickened up considerably after a few minutes. I also was out of evaporated milk, so I used a mixture of milk, half-and-half, and heavy whipping cream. Terrific!

This is the best homemade macaroni I  have tried! I only had 5 oz. of evaporated milk so I made up the rest with 4 oz. heavy cream and 3 oz. milk. I also cut the salt and pepper in half and added about 1 tsp. of garlic salt to make it more like alfredo. There didn't seem to be enough cheese, so I added about a cup more. I used half cheddar and half Mexican blend. Delicious!

This is the first time I have made homemade mac and cheese, and I think it turned out beautifully.  Per previous reviewers' suggestions, I went with a blend, rather than sharp cheddar alone, which I think accounts for the fantastic consistency and complex flavor that resulted (I used a cheddar, american, jack and mozzarella blend).  I also went with 3 cups of cheese and 2 1/2 cups of macaroni. I'm so glad I volunteered to bring the mac and cheese this Christmas!

YUMMO!!! It is fast and easy, and best of all I have almost all of the ingredients always at hand. Nothing fancy shmansy about this recipe BUT it tastes like it took you hours to prepare;) I did add a teaspoon of grated onion for a little bit of zing.  My 3 year old son loves macNcheese and I'm pregnant craving it very often....so to cut down on sodium I wanted to swtich from the store-bought to homemade. I've been looking all over the internet for a quick and healthy version...not the ones with so many fancy items in them! I'm so glad to have found this recipe and thanks to everyone for their tips! This will be a regular at our dinner table!:))))

description doesn't lie.  it was quick and easy and it tasted great.  i've never been a fan of homemade mac n cheese when i've had it in the past, but the inlaws were in town for thanksgiving and i didn't think that "kraft" was good enough for my completely homemade feast so i did a quick search and i found the perfect recipe! i used 1 tsp of dry mustard on accident and my evap was fat free.  it still came out beautiful and yummy!  i'm definitely making this again!

I agree with Deborah, it had a funny taste to it.  It was still good, but not deserving of the accolade, in my opinion.  The proportions were really off, too, and with so little macaroni it's completely drowned in the sauce.  Not going to be a keeper for me.

I am not sure why this recipe calls for 1 cup of water. IF I were going to  use water I would use the water that I cooked the macaroni in. But instead I  substitued 2% milk. I used heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk. It turned out creamy and delicious! I also added a squirt of prepared mustard which gave it just a little "bite" but you don't taste it as mustard. Grated a little onion in with the sauce as it thickened.  Can't think of another thing that would make it any better.  I just don't get the water. Oh well, I'll keep making this with the changes as stated. It was a really good, traditional mac and cheese!!

I highly recommend severely undercooking the pasta if you are going to bake it for the desired time or more, the sauce was a little runny so I baked it longer but it made the noodles very mushy - the whole thing was boiling in the oven so it makes sense that the noodles cooked more.  I also agree it needs more cheese in the sauce, I used about 3 cups total and it could have used even more than that. Not a calorie conscious choice but if the flavor is what matters it would be my recommendation. I also would add more dry mustard and pepper but it was quite good.

i used flour instead of cornstarch, paprika instead of mustard (next time i'll use 1/4- 1/2 tsp), and 1 cup milk instead of evaporated milk and water. and i added all the cheese tothe sauce instead of baking to make it easier.

i would also reccomend 2.5- 3 cups mac

if you always get clumpy sauce, remember to turn off the heat before adding cheese (do not boil it) and follow the heating instructions. i've finally realized that and successfully made a mac and cheese

Easy and delicious. I don't make mac and cheese from scratch very often, but when I do it was always with a white sauce involving flour and whisking. I'm now sold on this method: evap milk and cornstarch. Nice and creamy, but super-fast!

WOW!  One reader wondered why the rave reviews.  Duhh.  This is a great Mac and Cheese.  We haven't even gotten it to the table yet but Husband and I have tasted it and it ROCKS.  I think I may have added a bit to much salt to the cooking water for the mac, but it's still great.  Hubby is a cheese-a-holic so I added probably 3 cups of Extra sharp cheese that I grated in my processor.  I find the stuff you grate at home is MUCH better than the bagged stuff.  I didn't bake.  Just put in a warm oven with a little more cheese sprinkled on top.  I like my mac and cheese creamy so I don't bake it.  Yum!  This way, it's almost instant mac and cheese!
Update 08/06/11 I made again tonight and realized I forgot the butter.  No problem.  It's not quite as smoothy creamy but tastes just the same.  Again, I shredded my own store brand extra sharp cheese.  Don't measure, but about 3/4 of my food processor bowl and it's just heaven.  This is definitely a cheese lover's dream come true!  Oh, cook your mac only 8 minutes with still a bit of a bite to it and it will hold up well even if you bake it.  I don't like mush pasta (who does?) and this is plenty of time.  Hold off a little on the salt in your water as the extra cheeae adds the salty taste.  Couldn't be any better or easier.

My Mac and cheese of choice now. A permanent in my books. I hate the egg-based ones as well, and was looking for a non-velveeta recipe. This one is perfect. I used skim milk instead of water, and topped it with Gruyere cheese. Thank you Carnation!!

I made this for my boyfriend and a friend he was living with at the time and they both loved it. I added double the cheese it called for, though. Also when I boiled the pasta I added garlic salt to the water. It's barely noticeable but it added something nice to it. This is a great dish to make with whole grain pasta if you're not a fan of the taste because the cheese covers up that taste.

Just plain good!  Don't skimp on any of the ingredients and make sure the heat is at medium for the sauce and all is well.  Did this one a few times.  Once I added diced tomatoes, canadian bacon, and topped with italian bread crumbs.  The cheese sauce totally fools my picky kids into eating the tomatoes!

Nice recipe but needs a boost in flavor.  Made this once as is and decided to make a few changes and try again.  This time we used heavy cream in place of the canned evaporated milk.  This gave a much fresher taste!  We also upped the mustard to 1 teaspoon,  1/2 teaspoon white pepper and 1/2 teaspoon hot paprika.  This worked well as a stove top dish and I did not bake in the oven.  This recipe, with our changes, in now a keeper!

I had no idea that homemade mac & cheese was THIS easy! Everyone LOVED it. You could really dress this up as a complete meal by adding cooked ground beef and sauteed onions. Also you could add a crumb topping for an added touch. (1 Tbsp. melted butter & 2 Tbsp. bread crumbs)

This was a delicious dish, though I did deviate from the recipe somewhat.  I used about 3 cups of whatever types of cheese we had in the house - some mozzarella, mild cheddar, extra sharp cheddar, and Parmesan.  I also used 1 1/2 cup 1% milk instead of the evaporated milk/water combo.

After reading about 30 recipes for baked Mac & Cheese, I decided on this one because it sounded simple and flavorful.  WOW!  Every time I make it my family tells me I'm the best...  It's so creamy and delicious. plus it re-heats well if you have some leftover! I do modify the recipe by adding 1/2 cup Pankow bread crumbs coated with 2 Tbsp butter on the top before baking.  It adds a nice crunch to the top that stays crunchy even the next day.  My daughter likes to use potato chip crumbles on top instead.  I recommend this recipe to everyone!

This recipe is easy and great-tasting!  I found that there was a little too much liquid near the end and adjusted the recipe to 1 2/3 cup uncooked, rather than cooked macaroni.  I used large elbow macaroni and MOUNDS of yellow cheddar, aged white cheddar, and asiago cheeses and sprinkled a generous portion of panko over the top before baking ...  All recipes are "to taste," anyway.  :)  The macaroni and cheese was a huge hit for our Christmas Eve buffet and I'm sure there will be requests for the dish again in the future!

This was great, but I would definately recommend more cheese. I used the 2 cups in the sauce and grated extra for the top. Oh, and I tried it with reduced-fat cheese and it was awful. Need full-fat for this.

We used Plain soy milk instead of evaporated milk. It is so far the best recipe we have found. Cheese doesn't bother us as bad as milk and I'm sure we cut tons of fat and calories! Kids love'd it and we used the extra sauce over our broccoli!

Super easy!!! Of course I used more cheese. My mistake was thinking I could make this ahead and bake it later...WRONG!! It gets a little dried out that way (easy fix by adding a half cup of milk before baking). Also, I used whole milk insted of evaporated. Great recipe.

Really good recipe!!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added more cheese, including ~1/2 cup mix of italian cheeses.  I added all cheese to the sauce instead of putting it on top.  I wanted to give it a little more kick so I added 1/2 the salt, twice the mustard and 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic powder, it was excellent!!

Easy and Excellent!  After reading the other reviews,  I increased the amount of all the ingredients by 1/2, except for the macaroni.  This game me plenty of creamy sauce that was delicious.  I like a crispy top so I crumbled up some Cheez-it crackers to sprinkel on the top. Baked in a convection oven for 20 minutes and it came out perfect!

I love this macaroni and cheese recipe. I have never made a decent one until I tried this version. And so darn easy!!!! I have shared this with everyone I know. I even made it at my best friends house for her Sunday dinner with her mother in law. Said it turned out great and since I doubled the recipe for her she said there were plenty of leftovers. This Mac n Cheese is even better the next day. I don't change anything usually but have added precooked bacon inside and crumbled on top. Delicious just the way it is.

This was really good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did add a bit more cheese. I will make this again, but next time will not use as much salt(my boyfriend and I found this a tad too salty) but I will definitely make it again! It's a good, simple mac and cheese recipe.

I made this recipe last night and thought it was very tasty!  I did make a few minor changes, following other reviewers' suggestions.  I used whole milk instead of water and used 2 5-oz cans of evaporated milk (that's all I had).  I also used a half-pound of homemade spaghetti noodles and added extra cheese.  Overall, a very good recipe!

Easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand.  The kids weren't as fussy but they just need to get used to this type of mac and cheese instead of the stuff out of the box.

SO. GOOD. 
This was my first try at making home-made mac and cheese and it turned out exceptionally well, if I do say so myself. I didn't bother with the mustard because I'm not a fan, and just used 2% milk instead of evaporated. I made my own cheese mix from whatever was in my fridge: leftover shredded cheese from our taco night, parmesan, american, and cheddar cheeses. Basically whatever you like, put it in! And in my opinion, the more cheese the better ;)
Very simple and very delicious, and best of all it takes next to no time to make!

This is the most creamy, and easy mac and cheese recipe I've made. It wasn't grainy, and it was smooth. My girls enjoyed it before I baked it, and my 3 yr still enjoyed it for dinner after I added ground beef and onions and baked it.

I thought this recipe was delicious! I did DOUBLE the cheese, but I naturally like my mac&cheese cheesy anyway. I have been looking for a homemade mac&cheese recipe that I like for ages, although mine looked nothing like the picture. I used extra sharp cheddar & a British white sharp cheddar. WILL MAKE AGAIN.

This turned out great.  I made a few changes that were recommended by others.  I used more cheese, probably double and also added more macaroni, probably 2 1/4 cups.  The only other thing I did different was add some steamed cauliflower that was roughy mashed up.  We like it in our house.  Will definitely make again.

Just the way I like it!  I did make a few changes based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I used mild instead of sharp cheddar.  Flour instead of cornstarch.  I only used 1/4 tsp. of dry mustard just because I am not a huge fan of an overly mustard flavored mac and cheese.  If you like your mac and cheese creamy, you could skip the baking.  So good!

I'm a little confused by all the five-star ratings.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor was good but the texture was questionable.  I'm a foodie but don't think I'm a food snob.  A simple comfort-food meal can be a gourmet experience, but this one was not.  Leftovers were a little better the next day, but we mostly ate it just to not be wasterful.  I'm new to the site, and I"m wondering if the other 5-star recipes I'm wanting to try will be just as forgettable.

what I like most about this basic recipe is being able to add/subtract from it. I too added a bit more cheese, for my liquids I used nonfat milk and fat free half/half.  I took 2 ends from a loaf of daves killer bread and crumbed them, cooked them in butter till crispy and then put on top of the mac/cheese before baking.

WOW! This turned out great! Some people said that they didn't see the difference from other recipes, I really to believe it's personal choice also if you're a true mac & cheese lover. If you love Mac & Cheese you'll love this!!! I added double the amount of cheese, 1/2 c. grated Parm, 3 cups of yellow sharp & 1 cup white sharp.. and the results were yuummy!!!

This recipe was hit with my family, however, I didn't care for the texture to much. I've personally had better mac before. Overall, it was easy to make and adding seasoning salt to the dish really balanced out the flavors. I'd give this dish a 3.5 out of 5

Have made this twice and both time got rave reviews and recipe requests.  I did add more cheese both times and when I made it yesterday, I didn't have any cheddar.  I used a mix of italian and mexican blends.  I also didn't have any evaporated milk yesterday so I used some whole and some skim milk.

I used whole milk for this and when I ran out of cheddar - I used mozza and parmesan.  It was edible but next time, old cheddar is a must.  Otherwise the technique and rest is great.  I also toasted up some cubed bread with melted butter overtop for a bit of diversity.

The best homemade mac and cheese Ive made/had! I made changes: Doubled the recipe so 3 1/3 C of dry elbow macaroni, however I wanted to ensure it came out EXTRA creamy so I ommited the 1/3 Cup and just cooked 3 cups and I made the same amount of sauce that the recipe called for. I used ground mustard powder as well as prepared mustard, white pepper to keep it from looking like black specks were in it and skim milk rather than evap.  I also added one can of cheddar cheese soup.  A few users said that it was too salty, I found it not salty enough with the amount the recipe called for, so I added a tsp more. Another tip is to under cook the pasta.  I cooked it for about 7 minutes, and it cooked the rest of the time in the oven. Yes I made a lot of changes! But I wouldnt have made a good mac n cheese with out this recipe!

Yummers! The sauce is sooooo good! I modified it a bit to use what I had on hand- used all skim milk in replacement of evaporated milk & water, used a whole wheat rotini, added a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder, used a light mozza-cheddar cheese blend (extra added to sauce) and threw in some smoked bacon. Sounds like a load of changes but either way it turned out soooooo good! Definitely a keeper!1

Have always used Velveeta in mac n cheese but ran out. So glad I did. Used regular milk instead of the evaporated milk and didn't bake like others suggested. Family loved it! I loved it! Tasted mac n cheese I hadn't had in over 20 years-it immediately reminded me of my late grandmother's recipe (which my mother didn't like and never fixed) that we had at all our big family get-togethers.

This is a delicious mac and cheese recipe!  It's easy, cheap, and tastes great.  I had another recipe that cost me almost $20 just in the cheese that I had to buy.  This one cost me less than $7.  It's great left over, too!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it is fine just the way it is.  Just make sure to never over-salt!

I would select 4 1/2 stars if it were here.  There was separation in the delicious cheese sauce, so I have to deduct 1/2 star.  

Anyway, I screwed up the "1 2/3 cups dry macaroni" part, and boiled about 1 cup macaroni, which yielded 2 cups.  I used about 1 3/4 cup of cooked macaroni since I thought I was supposed to use 1 2/3 cups cooked macaroni.  Whoops.  So when I made the cheese sauce, it was really really cheesy!  The result was a very very creamy and cheesy macaroni that was TDF.  

There was some separation in the cheese which messed up the texture, but the taste was excellent regardless.

Finally, this served with some simple steamed broccoli was divine.  No need for the pan fried kielbasa I made.  I plan to make again.

I made the recipe exactly as it is written (plus an extra half cup of cheese) and it was DELICIOUS! Usually I dislike homemade mac 'n' cheese due to the fact that it's never creamy. This is creamy and flavorful and delicious! If you're a fan of spices, you can certainly dress it up. Cayenne or garlic powder would have been a nice addition. Will be making again and again!

Only change we made was to use 1 cup of Italian blend cheese for one of the cups of cheddar. We also used mild cheddar but I'mnot sure if that made much of a difference. Disclaimer - Do NOT make this recipe if you are on a diet ... it's way too tempting.

Very simple. Instead of using water, I used an extra can fat free evaporated milk. I did add a little more cheese both in the macaroni and cheese and a little on top. The ratio of noodle and sauce was perfect. This was one recipe in a full Take-Out Fake-Out meal when we couldn't afford a local take out chicken resteraunt.

I tried this for the first time and it turned out really well. My husband enjoyed it; there weren't any leftovers! I didn't have any cornstarch so I used flour instead. I also added breadcrumbs mixed with butter as a layer on top. The amount of cheese the recipe calls for isn't enough - at least for my husband and I.. I added a lot more cheese. MMmmm Delicious! :)

So, so good!  I customized by using several different cheeses (2 c. mozzarella, 2 c. cheddar, 1 c. parmigiano reggiano, cooking for 15 mins. and then topping with goat cheese and returning to oven for another 10 mins.).  I also added a 1/2 t. of paprika in with the dry ingredient mix.

Good macaroni and cheese, I didn't think it was amazing, but it's a good, quick, yummy filler. I think I might play with it some. Thanks for sharing :)

I substituted the evaporated milk and water for 2 1/2 cups of milk (the total amount) like the previous reviewer did. I haven't tried it yet (it's still in the oven!) but it looked delicious, and I'll definitely keep this recipe handy for when I get a craving for something cheesy!

Great comfort food recipe. Great results. Used 3 cups of lower fat cheese blend and 2% milk in place of all liquid ingredients. Sprinkled bread crumbs on top before baking.

I love this recipe because it has cheddar rather than velveeta, which we HATE!  I always add corn and a jalapeno to this dish.  Serve it for dinner with some fresh bread.

I love the recipe! Finicky eaters in my house loved it. I did add more cheese though - not a whole lot more, but a little more and used whipped butter to lower the sodium content. And, we also ate it without the baking step.

I will make this recipe again.  The best mac and cheese recipe I've found yet.  The only suggestions for next time by the family were, a little dry and a little bland.  I think I'll add more water and maybe some more mustard and pepper.  I did add more cheese, since we love cheese.

I'm giving this four stars, because it's a very good base and would have been good without my modifications, but they were substantial changes and I do think they brought it to a new level (though I have not made the recipe without the modifications). I used a bit more salt, doubled the pepper and used a tbsp of Dijon mustard, since i didn't have mustard powder.  I used 1 1/2 cups white cheddar and 1 1/2 cups mozzarella. I also added 1/4 tsp of hot chilli powder, one small can of diced green chilis and 1/2 cup sour cream. My changes made for a yummy, moderately spicy twist on traditional mac and cheese that the whole family loved.

good recipe, husband enjoyed it very much. I do think it comes out a little too dry, after being baked, i think i might add a little less corn starch and a hair more water and it should be perfect. Has a great cheese flavor!

I love this recipe. I found this recipe about 6 months ago and use it all the time. Its a big hit with my kids. I make it once or twice a week for my 3yr old because Mac N cheese is her favorite she wants to have it as a side for just about every meal. We use to make boxed mac n cheese all the time for her and everyone was getting tired of it. The only thing we do different is use Whole wheat elbow macaroni and we dont use any dry mustard. Its really delicious.

Wow, this came out great! I used a whole box (13.25 oz) of whole wheat elbow macaroni & doubled the rest of the ingredients. Also, added 2 cups of chopped ham... wish I had added more like 4 cups. Put in a 13x9 inch pan. Served with Parmesan Zucchini Spears from this site. Will be making again!

Update: I've made this a few more times. It is PERFECT with 3 cups of chopped ham. I've tried using all sharp cheddar & other times used a blend of 3 kinds of cheddar & we can't tell the difference. We love this recipe so much!

This was pretty good- nice and creamy. I used 2% evaporated milk, left out the butter, and topped with bread crumbs. I used a mix of mild cheddar and monterey jack cheeses. I prefer the ones that use Velveeta, but this was good with what I had on hand. Thanks!

I took others suggestions on a few details and it turned out WONDERFUL! I used about 3 cups of rotini and shells ((mixed as that was all I had on hand)) I also increased the cheese to 3.5 cups ((which I used sharp cheddar and a handful of pepper jack)) I had some smoked spiral honey ham that I diced up and added to the cooked pasta ((about 1.5 cups)) I also added 1/2 t of liquid smoke to the cheese sauce ((from another mac & cheese recipe)) I thought that it was a tad too much but my husband LOVED it and the kids cleaned their plates. So a definite KEEPER!! Thanks so much....

My husband absolutely loved this- said it is the best mac and cheese he's ever had! I did use much more cheese than called for-3 cups instead of 1 1/2 and 2 cups instead of 1/2 on top. I also used a bit more butter. It came out just right and I will definitely be making this again!

OMG...This was a totally unexpected taste of a dish.  Never, after all the times I've cooked anything have I gotten a "HUG".  My 17 year old got a dish and filled it, while walking to the table stopped in her tracks and spoke loudly to sam Oh My Gosh..then she put her dish down and gave me a hug.  Thank you for my moment of having a thankless job.  THANK YOU - THANK YOU - THANK YOU...!!!!!!!!!

I did as some others said, I used 1% milk and no water. I used more cheese than it called for, skipped baking,  and it was great. Hint: eat it all. Not very good when reheated as the cheese comes together leaving you with cheese that sticks to your teeth, watery sauce, and macaroni noodles.

This was really good, I had to give it a four though because i was making it for my friends children  who wanted plain Kraft mac and cheese and they didnt seem to like it as well. I would rate it a three for them. It didnt have the same creamy texture, not that i would want to imitate boxed macaroni.

I used gluten free elbow noodles and it still tasted awesome. My husband doesn't like macaroni and cheese much, but liked this recipe "much better than the boxed stuff." One thing I would like to add is make sure you stir constantly and babysit that liquid mixture in the pan. If you don't, lumps are created and it sticks to the bottom.

This was awesome! I took advice of other reviewers and did a blend of cheese - half mozza and half cheddar. I also used about 3 cups of cheese and a bit more pasta than it called for. At the end I stirred in cooked bacon pieces and served with a side of broccoli - it was a hit! One tip - don't salt the water for your pasta - there's enough salt in the dish. Great recipe!!

This was just the recipe I was looking for; simple, creamy and delicious.  I halved the recipe, (Since I live alone) and because I didn't want to bake it, I just browned some fresh bread crumbs in a little butter while the macaroni was cooking.  I used a combination of cheddar and American cheese and topped with the bread crumbs on my plate.  This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent base recipe!  I added the chopped ham suggestion and also added in 1/2 can Rotel tomatoes & 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  In a separate bowl I melted 2 Tbs butter and tossed with 1 cup crushed breadcrumbs.  I topped it with the breadcrumbs and it gave a nice crunchy crust out of the oven.  Absolutely delicious and hearty meal.

I doubled the recipe to make a big casserole and it came out PERFECT! the person who said it was dry must have done something wrong it sounds like cause it came out rich and creamy. I would make sure the dish is adequately greased with oilive oil as that made it not stick at all. As far as the noodles, I didnt measure. I just used one small box of small elbow macaroni by Ronzoni and it was just the right amount. Everything else I just doubled.

This is the best macaroni and cheese recipe.  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and my husband could not stop talking about how great it was!  I didn't have evaporated milk so I used 12 oz of Fat Free milk and no water.  I kept everything else the same.  I will definitely be making this again.  This is a winner in my house!

I used this recipe but used Pacific Skim Evaporated Milk and added one cup of regular milk in place of the water.  I use 1/2 teaspoon onion powder and 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt and 1/2 teaspoon salt. I used 2 1/2 cups of cheddar, parmesan and Mozzarella cheeses. 
For a topping I used 1/2 cup of the above cheeses, 3 tablespoons of margarine or butter melted and 12 crushed Ritz Crackers.  Mix together and spread on top.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Deliscious

DELICIOUS!!!!

My wrong in assuming, but I thought 1 tsp wouldn't be sufficient in salt, so I did 2...YIKES!  With the salt from the cheese, it was pretty salty, but nothing that a little ketchup couldn't fix.

Total hit for my 3 year old daughter as well!

This was more simple than others and since it was my first try this seemed like a good recipe. I did tweek it after reading a few other reviews. I added half an onion, a teaspoon of paprika, and some ham steak. OH and extra cheese. My husband and son are both very picky and they loved this. Very simple and yummy. Will definitely be making this again. And just as a suggestion, if it gets a bit thick, u can add milk to thin it a bit.

Pretty darn good!  It was VERY easy and even my picky 4 year old enjoyed it!  I prefer a bit of a creamier mac & cheese, but this was a great baked recipe.

Everyone loved this Mac n cheese at a party.  I did use 3/4 extra sharp cheddar though.  The rest I used sharp cheddar.  Yummy.

Love this recipe, very similar to mine. It is easily adaptable to different tastes. To those who didn't like the evaporated milk, any milk will do.  I use the evap milk and skim instead of the water.  Also when it is just the family, I use mexican cheese blend, gives it a nice flavor. Any meat tastes great as an add in as well. I don't think there is anything I haven't tried. But for a nice summer meal I add in diced turkey ham and make a nice salad. It's always a hit, especially with the picky kidds. I made a double portion for my family of 5, and my son asked me to make some more the same night. It was GONE!

I stuck to the recipe but doubled it, and it was a hit. Very creamy and cheesy, which in turn makes for great left over meal because it still is creamy instead of dryed out.

This is the best Mac and Cheese I ever made! It has the best taste ever and I owe that to the dry mustard, which is a secret little ingredient that transforms this from ordinary to extraordinary! I like to double up on the dry mustard because I like the taste so much but it’s great just as it is. Make sure all directions are followed exactly, especially stirring the corn starch and milk mixture. This has to thicken and double in height in the pot. Perfect dish!

My son's favorite food is Kraft Mac and Cheese from the box. It's the only one he'll eat, so I was a bit hesitant to try this out, but wow am I glad I did. The taste was wonderful, however, I did put a bit more cheese in than it called for since my son is a cheese fanatic. All in all, this is the only mac and cheese he wants now. It's also real quick and easy to make when you have very little time to throw dinner together for the family. I will definitely be making this again.

Part of the family enjoyed this, except for the kids who normally love mac & cheese, and myself. It was just too dry for me.... and not creamy enough.  I made it according to recipe, but if I should decide to give it another chance, I think I will use less corn starch.

This is the BEST stuff ever!!!  My husband and brother-in-law love when I make it.  I alter the recipe a bit by using 2 tablespoons of dry mustard, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, put all the cheese in, and instead top with crushed Ritz crackers for a toasty touch.  We also increase the recipe so everyone can have leftovers for lunch!

Really awful. The evaporated  milk gave it a strange taste. In complete disclosure, my milk expired 6 months ago, but the label said 'best by..." not don't use it because it will be weird. Do you think it's worth trying again with new evaporated milk, or should I use regular milk?

Even a novice cook can do this one; but take care not to thicken the sauce too much - thinning with milk if you do.

Try adding 3/4 cup, thinly sliced pepperoni (bagged for pizza at the market). This spicy sausage adds more zip than diced ham. Mix the pepperoni with the other ingredients; but save 8-10 slices to garnish the very top before baking.

My family loves this recipe!  I add a pound of hamburger and 2 cups of broccoli florets and it's terrific.  Recently I was out of evaporated milk and I used buttermilk powder to make "evaporated milk" and it was soo good. Gave it a nice tangy flavor.

Pretty good though, like some others,  I also thought the evaporated milk gave it a bit of a funky flavor.  Not as rich and creamy as I would like, but it was okay for a kids birthday party.

Loved it. Used more cheese and whole wheat pasta. Also sprinkled bread crumbs on top for extra crunch. Didn't have evaporated milk so I used some regular whole milk.
