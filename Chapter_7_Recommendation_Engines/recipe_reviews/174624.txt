I made this while I was pregnant and had gestational diabetes, as it was lower in carbs. I was cheap and used "krab" instead, but it was still delicious. Very rich tasting. I found it had to bake longer, though. Would love to try it with real crab when I can splurge.

Update: 8 years out from my original review and this is still a favorite meal in our home. I’ve upped the egg count to 4, and I’ve taken to pulsing the krab in a food processor as it’s much faster. I recommend flake-style krab if you go that route, and I do go heavy on the old bay. 

To the person who originally posted this recipe - Thank you for years of delicious and easy dinners!

This was easy to make and pretty good.  It was a bit bland; it reminded me of a crab cake with less flavor.  Next time I might add some green onions, tarragon, and more Old Bay.  We'll see.  Again, it was pretty good as is, and I'll probably make it again.  I just felt it could have had a little something more.

I made this exactly as written. I used the "fake" crab meat, and it tasted delicious. You might want to bump up the red pepper or the Old Bay seasoning for more "oomph," but my husband and I like things a little less spicy, so the seasoning as written was perfect. This is a keeper. Served it with steamed asparagus.

I was kinda skeptical at first. I had some left over crab legs and all the fixings needed. It was crazy good. I didn't really stray from the recipe and I'm not mad. I would way rather make these then crab cake. I think next time I would do it like the instructions but thin layer a cup cake tray to make single serve ones that cook more even and crispy.

Delicious & so easy!  Made with real crab, the only thing I can say is that I cooked it longer than 20 minutes, more like 40 minutes.  I will definitely make this again!
