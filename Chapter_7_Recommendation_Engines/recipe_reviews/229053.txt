I made two minor changes--I did not have fresh diced green chilies on hand but I did have one 4 ounce can of diced mild green chilies that I used instead. I also used half of a small bottle of Frank's Hot Sauce instead of a full bottle. The taco seasoning I used was homemade and I used california ground chili powder, which has the same great flavor but is milder and not as hot. I did not try this myself but my husband and kids had this for dinner and they ate almost the whole goshdarn roast on their own. They all called me at work and told me how delicious it was--even the littlest! They all told me that I must make this again very soon. NOTE: We used the meat in this recipe for soft tacos, with homemade refried beans and mexican rice on the side.

We don't ever chop the onions or dice the peppers in this recipe but simply thinly slice them.  Then when you shred the meat you have the strands of onions and peppers mixed in with it.  Served with grilled corn tortillas, a corn salsa and a squeeze of lime and it is a fantastic meal.  Also a great meat for modified korean style tacos (think kimchi).

If you are cooking for someone who prefers a milder dish choose a milder pepper and don't use the hot sauce or cayenne, my kids love it this way.

I make this dish often with the beef chuck roast or boneless pork spare ribs. Since I like to have a filling for tacos as well as a soup, I add 2 cups of beef or chicken stock to the cooker. I also use a can of  Ro*tel diced tomatoes with diced green chilies instead of just the diced chilies.

Wow.  I can't believe no one has commented on the heat (spice) of this recipe.  I saw the 1 & 1/4 cup of chilies and the 5 oz of hot sauce and thought, geez, that's got to be hot.  Then I looked through the reviews and no one mentions it, so I followed the recipe.  By scraping off all of the chilies and not using any of the sauce, it was edible. FYI: we live in south LA and are very use to cayenne and hot sauce but this was HOT!  I'd make adjustments before cooking it again.

I made this as close to recipe as I could.  I used 2.5#  beef roast instead of 4#. The rest was done to directions. Gave the next door neighbor some and he liked it too. For a point of reference, I eat at a taco stand that has a "fire taco sauce" that I do not find too hot, while the neighbor uses the mild sauce at the same stand. All who ate this tasty roast beef did not think it was  too hot. Enjoy.  Great leftovers too.

I love cooking meat in the slow cooker and this looks wonderful except to much hot sauce I would reduce it to half the amount called for.Also meat has gotten so expensive in the last year or two that a four lb.roast is quite an investment and we sold our large freezer so can't freeze a large beef roast but may buy a smaller roast and cook it instead.

I made this yesterday, served it last night. It was wonderful! I read the reviews first, so I did tweak it a bit according to some of the suggestions. I had a smaller roast, so I cut back on the ingredients. Glad I did, cause it was HOT! I used 2 cans of green chilies and 1/2 bottle of hot sauce. Figured I could always add more if needed, but it definitely did not need any more heat! The meat was so tender. I served it with a side dish of Mexican rice, and the juice was so good on the rice. Thanks for the suggestion to use the meat in soft tacos. I actually have them on hand, and that's what we'll be doing with the leftovers. This dish is definitely company worthy, if you know your company likes Mexican and spicy dishes.

I thought this recipe was yummy!! I don't know why the folks who didn't like the recipe didn't feel like it had any flavor because mine came out FULL of taste!! I stabbed the meat with a sharp knife and made sure there was a lot of garlic on top of it so the garlic would drip down in to the meat. Served wih mashed potatoes and covered with the au jaus that was made while cooking. DELICIOUS!!! I'm adding this one to my recipe box! :)

I really gave this a single star only because the meat was tender- but all chuck roast cooked in a crock pot is tender.  The spicing for this roast had two things wrong with it: first, if prepared exactly the way listed, it is so screaming hot that no one could eat it except my lead-stomached husband, who said he almost couldn't either, and second, there is almost no flavor here except the mild bitterness that comes from this selection of spices and, as said before, the incredible heat! I don't know how anyone could have achieved different results since I followed the recipe meticulously.

Delicious recipe, not overly hot but with a lovely warmth but I DID modify it for reason. We love pork so I used boneless country pork spare ribs and wanting to limit salt, used that very lightly and then sprinkled with Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime before browning.  During browning, kind of as an after-thought, I added some Mrs. Dash Southwestern Chipotle.  Very coarsely chopped the onion into narrow wedges, used roasted Hatch green chiles I had on hand, coarsely chopped and removed some/most of the seeds. I did not use taco seasoning, having used the aforementioned seasoning but did use a bit more chili powder. I used about 1/2 as much hot sauce for approx. 3 lbs of pork and used minced garlic since I never use garlic powder.  I also sprinkled everything with about 3 T. of lime juice and, because it was sitting overnight before the actual cooking, added maybe 1/4 c water to the crock.  The next morning, I set it out of the refrigerator about an hour before inserting it in the cooking unit and cooked it on High for 4.5 hours...smaller amount of a different type/cut of meat. It came out perfectly tender with just the right amount of cooking liquid; glad I added the additional liquid as I fear the pork may have been dry otherwise.  My son who is a great cook and loves green chiles thoroughly, thought this was delicious, I shared the recipe and I'm sure both of us will make this again. And I will try it with beef.

YUM! This is such a great and EASY recipe. I made it for a family event and have already been asked to make it again for the next one. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used pork instead of beef and instead of taco seasoning (I didn't have any on hand) I used some "Mexican Spice". The heat (and much of the flavor!) depends on which hot sauce you use. The first time I made it I used Franks Red Hot because I had a lot of it, and it was good for a crowd. Last night I made it and used Tapatio with a little bit of Ghost Pepper hot sauce. We love spicy food so that was perfect. This tastes great in a taco (CORN tortilla!) with fresh pico and some lime on it. Highly recommend!

Ok, it was not my intent to change the recipe, but I had to use what I had on hand and do what I could time-wise. First, I did not brown the meat, I just put it in the slow cooker. I cut an onion into big chunks, and sliced a large clove of garlic and added . I make my own taco seasoning ( from this site) and added about 1/8 cup because that is all that I had left.  Added a can of Rotel tomatoes with lime and cilantro. Added black pepper and about 2 oz. of Tipatico hot sauce. Cooked on high for 6 hours. Fabulous. I am sure the original recipe is equally fabulous...I just had to make due!

My entire family loved this meat! I shredded it and we made amazing burritos with white rice and cilantro, cheese, etc...  Even though I don't eat spicy food, the only change I made was to use a small can of diced green chilies instead of fresh green chili pepper, and only used about 1/4 c of onion since my family doesn't really like onion. I also used two smaller roasts instead of one big one.  To lessen the impact of the heat,  I just used less meat when I made my burrito.  
I have told everyone about this recipe, and so far everyone else has enjoyed it just as much as we did.  One friend who made it used half the amount of cayenne, and she said it turned out great.

really awesome complex flavor.   A good tip is to cut your roast into large chucks and then brown.  This allows more flavor to get into the meat.  I also omitted the Taco seasoning and cayenne and just increased the other seasonings.  I wasn't looking for a strong taco flavor but more of a savory , warm  and spicy beef.  I  added a couple tablespoons of oregano and only two tablespoons of a rather hot pepper sauce.  Believe me it was enough heat and i couldn't imagine adding any more which would wipe out all the other important flavors.  Finally i just added enough beef broth to cover  meat and the outcome was delicious.  The sauce was sooooo good.  I rolled up cooked meat with cheese in tortillas and topped with some hot au jus which is really where spice and heat is concentrated.  My family added sour cream and salsa on top.    I cooked the meat on high  for 4 hours and another hour and a half on low.  Excellent.  The second time I made this I added about a 1/3 cup of Italian dressing to change it up bit.  Some ate in warmed tortillas and I also served it over boiled potatoes with lots of au jus.

We love this roast.  We use the left overs for burritos, tacos and whatever else happens to be around.  I have actually froze leftovers for later and they turned out good too.  No need to change anything in the recipe.  Did not find it too hot at all.

I made this a couple of months ago with a 2# pot roast, but used the same amount of the other ingredients, thinking of course, from past experiences with slow cooking, the flavors would be more bland if I halved everything.  Not so!  I probably should have halved the spices, but it was quite tasty and spicy!  It made alot even with a 2# roast. I did, as one other reviewer did, thinly slice a jalapeno and onion and let that cook with the meat to mix in when it was shredded.  I also just made the spice ingredients into a paste, including the olive oil, and smeared it all over the roast, then put it in the crock pot and let it cook.  It was delicious and am making it again today for another round of meals!  I collect hot sauces from different places I travel, so this time is a completely different hot sauce I am using and also made my own taco seasoning, since I don't usually keep that on hand.  Trying to keep it all natural!  Love, love,love this recipe!

I made it, with a few substitutions. It was wonderful!

Instead of the green chilis, I substituted 20 pods of De Arbol chili peppers, seeds and all. I used dried ground serrano peppers instead of cayenne pepper. For hot sauce, I used a habanerro sauce. I also added 1/4 cup red wine and 1 cup chicken broth.

I cooked it in a stovetop pressure cooker, 90 minutes with 15 lbs pressure.

It came out WONDERFUL! It was very tender and extremely spicy! It was very simple to use the leftovers in tacos, as the meat came apart with a spoon. I will be making this again - many times!

I made this in my Crockpot without searing. I used the salt, pepper, homemade taco seasoning to the recipe above, 1/4c Frank’s Red Hot, and added 1/4c Pot Belly Brand Hot Peppers with juice instead of chilies, which I did not have on hand. I cooked it on Low overnight and shredded it in the morning. I had a taste of the meat with scrambled eggs and it was AMAZING!  A little spicy, but not too bad.

This is super tasty. I scaled back on the ingredients as my roast was around 4 lbs. I didn’t have green chili’s so I used rotel. I was afraid it might be too spicy, but it wasn’t. I will make this again.

Great recipe with a few minor tweaks depending on your taste. 1) I seared the roast on my gas bbq grill - way easier and tastier than on stove.
2) I grilled the onions also.
3) To ease on spice I used 5 oz. of Herdez medium heat salsa instead of the hot sauce.
4) I used 7 oz can of green chilies.
5) 2 teaspoons of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.
7) 1 large can of hominy corn with juices (optional for more of a tortilla soup type of experience vs. tacos)
I liked the 1/4 cup taco seasoning and felt it was just the right amount... added the perfect amount of salt flavor unlike many other crock pot recipes that don't seem to have enough salt.
Top with sour cream and cheese and avocado and cilantro if you are doing a soup version.

It was really hot!!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out so hot I could barely eat it.

I've made this twice already. The first time my brother (who is a very good cook) couldn't believe it and that it tasted so good. The second time I made it for brunch tacos for my nephews, they still didn't believe I made it. Thanks for the vote of confidence, but they are forgiven because they are my favorite kiddos!

Mine didn't "fall apart" but it was very tender. I did add broth to the crock pot for moisture. I didn't add the hot sauce and the spice was perfect. It was good for a crowd and those who needed more spice just added it. I will make this again!

I had such high hopes for this recipe because I liked the ingredients but as the other reviewers indicated, it was too spicy.  I even cut everything in half as I had a 2.8 pd roast.  I only used about 2 oz of the hot sauce.  If I make it again, i'll just splash in the hot sauce and skip the cayenne.

This is such a good recipe though I don't use as much hot sauce only about half. Comes out plenty spicy. I freeze the leftovers in portions and reheat when in need for a fast dinner. Sometimes make this with fried flour tortilla top with the meat, beans, avocado, sour cream, salsa, and a fried egg :) so good!

I made this recipe over the weekend and loved it! For the green chiles, I just used 2 small cans of diced green chiles. I left out the taco seasoning and hot sauce and used about 7 oz. of salsa verde. I used all other spices and two shallots instead of the large onion. Lastly, I made it with a 2.5 lb roast. So tasty!

Delicious but hot... my only change would be reducing Cayenne to 1/2 tsp.  Moist, shreds great for tacos or on rice.

This was one of the first things I cooked for my boyfriend.  If the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, this one worked!  My son likes it a lot as well.   Of course you can vary the heat based on the type and amount of chilies and hot sauce.  Some are hotter than others, but I've found that most of the heat seems to be in the liquid with this. The more the meat is strained the less hot it seems to be.  Once it's done I pull the meat out and shred it.  Then I return it to the broth and cook it a little longer.  We eat it on tortillas.

This was really good and easy to make.  I followed the recipe except I did not have cayenne pepper or chili powder so instead I used Mrs. Dash extra spicy seasoning.  I also used Rotel instead of green chilies.  I cooked it for 8 hours in my crock pot and served it with Zatarans red beans and rice and my husband loved it.  The chuck was on sale for $2.99 a pound so I bought a 4.5 pound chuck and cut it in half to sear both pieces well.  The searing was the "hardest" part due to the size of the meat, but you gotta sear it!  I have enough left over for two more dinner meals this week and I may even freeze some if I decide to not use it all this week.  I plan on keeping the broth for a soup too and it will freeze nicely.  It's only my husband and I so this was well worth the $13.00 purchase.

The sauce was good, but the meat was just ok.  Not sure if I'll do it again.

I have fixed this recipe on several different occasions.  The only complaint I got was that the sauce was a bit to spicy.  We have served this with taco shells and wraps with chopped cilantro and other items usually served with tacos.
Yummy.

I didn't have chili powder, so I left that out.  I also used only about 2oz of hot sauce. The meat had enough spice to it.  Really yummy and tender.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe and has become a new staple in our house! We include garlic cloves when searing the meat and use our favorite hot sauce - Gator Hammock Gator Sauce.  When using smaller roasts, we've cut the dry ingredients in half and it comes out perfect.

This was a major hit in my house.  My son has mentioned 3 times that I need to make this again and I just made it 2 days ago!  I usually read reviews and tweak the recipes, but I didn't have time on this one....no need.  It was great as is!!

Fairly simple and great for a big family. I added large slices of green bell peppers and onions. Good stuff for Taco Tuesdays!

This was a really wonderful recipe.  I made this for Cinco de Mayo, and had left overs for beef tacos during the week.  I think this would be excellent in many different dishes from burritos to quesadillas or nachos.  Regarding the heat or spiciness of the recipe, as with everything if you don't love spicy foods, you could decrease the amount of hot sauce to adjust to your own taste. 

This one will definitely be worked into the rotation.  Great to make over the weekend when you have more time and use for quick weeknight dinners. Thanks for sharing.

Made this recipe yesterday. Could only find a 2.5 lb Chuck Roast but made adjustments to accommodate. Yes it quite spicy, but, with a little cheese or crema on your taco....just right.

A great spicy roast!  We adjusted some of the ingredients since our roast wasn't as large.  Tastes great in flour tortillas!  We will be making this again!

I made this last night without changing anything.  My husband and I both thought it was fantastic, not too hot in my opinion and full of flavor!  I used it in burritos with cilantro lime rice, sour cream and avocados. Yum.  It tasted like something I got from the restaurant Chipotle. This is definitely a keeper recipe.
