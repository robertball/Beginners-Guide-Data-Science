This is everybody's favorite recipe, but it is very time consuming. . . The cake is so special with strawberries cut in half and placed all the way around the cake with the stem side up, it hides any imperfections as well, and several friends request that I make the cake with sliced almonds on the sides. It is one of the most delicious recipes that I have!

Confused about the coffee granules, but otherwise a great recipe.  If you want a richer flavour, try using dark chocolate (preferably 85% cocoa) in place of the semisweet chocolate.

Very excellent - I have made something similar before but with whipped cream folded through instead of the butter, but this is just as yummy. The cake collapses in on itself and will stick to the paper and needs to be carefully peeled off, which is why you add the extra mousse to ice (makes it look neat)- but you can just as easily use whipped cream to top and a handful of mixed berries for a dinner party dessert that will really impress.

Coffee granules are added to the batter.  Make sure that they are finely ground granules.  The coffee brings out the chocolate flavors.  I used to make this for my restaurant back in the day.  Although I baked all of the batter and then I would freeze the cake and top with rich mousse.  Freeze again and cut into individual serving sizes. Then I would dip the cake pieces into dark chocolate and store in my freezer.  I would always keep some in my pastry case.  I would serve the cake with some creme anglaise, fresh berries and dollops of whipped cream.  Heaven!
What's Great about this recipe it that it Gluten-Free!

Pure chocolate heaven!  Instead of spreading the top layer, I put it in a pastry bag and made swirls for a more interesting presentation.  I recommend using half the amount of coffee.
