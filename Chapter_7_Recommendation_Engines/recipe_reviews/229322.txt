I had a head of cabbage I needed to do something with so I decided to try this recipe. I had to change it a bit since I didn't have agave (used honey) or champagne vinegar (used red wine vinegar), but I think the biggest problem I have with it is the amount of truffle oil.  I love truffle oil, but it's overpowering in this dish.  I think a sesame oil would be a better bet for this salad.

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  It was so fresh and light tasting.  I did reduce the truffle oil by half as a result of another reviewer stating it was overpowering and I doubled the mint, which I loved.  I paired it with some spicy shrimp and it was a huge hit!

I had red cabbage to use and decided on this recipe. I thought it turned ok, my In-laws enjoyed.

A bit sweet. Perfect when combined with spicy shrimp.
