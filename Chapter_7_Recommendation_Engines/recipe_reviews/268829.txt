I followed the recipe exactly minus using the box of pasta I had on hand. I found this needed about double the sauce. The end result after hitting the oven was very dry. I think sauce wise you could just use a jar of spaghetti sauce if you were pressed on time. Add more cheese on top is my husband's input. My son ate 2 servings.
