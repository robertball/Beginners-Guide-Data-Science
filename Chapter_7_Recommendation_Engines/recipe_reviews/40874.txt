This a wonderful tasty snack and very quick and easy to make!!!  I put a little extra lemon and herb seasoning and dill into the oil for a little zippier taste.  I also added oyster crackers.  The guys I work with have all been asking for the recipe.

This is great for mailing in "care packages" or hug-from-home boxes.  I have made this as written for mailing here in the US and omitted the oil when sending it internationally.  (Three weeks of 100 degree Fahrenheit heat does bad things to oil.)  Also a fun snack for game day potlucks.

I used goldfish crackers and mini pretzels. I LOVE recipes where I can use up what I have on hand! I took this to a family reunion. Had to email the recipe to 2 people the next day. SOOOO EASY and tasty.

I like the seasoning mix.  I added a pinch of cayenne and and roasted at 250 for an hour, stirring every 15 min.  And of course I didn't have all the different cereals so I worked with what I had.  It's party mix, you can do whatever.  I will make this again!
