this seems silly...a recipe for ice...but you are absolutely making a very good point.   why go to the expense of making a drink and then adding flavors you don't intend with the ice?   a good reminder.   thank you.

Had a glass of ice water with lemon the other night with dinner and didn't finish it until after dinner, long after the ice had melted.  It wasn't particularly nasty, but I found when I'm in Naples the water just doesn't taste as good as when I'm home in Wisconsin. Did not enjoy the aftertaste at all, and now I'm sold on using these ice cubes for drinks.  (For other purposes, I'll continue to use the ice-maker ice, however).  On this occasion I used this "recipe" to make "Mint Ice Cubes," also from this site.  Nice, fresh, clean taste.  Love it.

great recipe but I somehow messed up the first batch and ended up with grilled cheese.

Seriously.  also try distilled water.  I keep food waste in my freezer (coffee grinds, onion peels, etc) and ice cubes left indefinitely taste the funk.

As if I wasn't fussy enough with my cocktails. But this is a good reminder. Seems like using distilled water would eliminate the need for boiling.

I was thinking ahead and doubled this batch for a party. Measurement calculating was tricky but I think I got it just right!

Awesome recipe!  I have used these in lemonade, soda, even fruit juice!  It did not go well in my hot chocolate though... cooled the whole thing down and made it watery.

I thought this was a joke at first but instead have tried and realize that it makes or breaks your drink. It improves tea and coffee drinks as well. Try it and you'll be a believer too! Thanks for the tip.

Perfect! I also added a touch of food coloring for various holidays. Green cubes in a gin & tonic during St Patty's is a refreshing alternative to beer.

Or just use a Culligan R.O. Ive only wanted filtered water for cocktails for years. Once you get spoiled, it's hard to go back.

I have made this recipe for a long time now, not even realizing that it was already made by someone else besides me or my family! It is a wonderful recipe, and I hope other people like it too.

It may seem a silly recipe at first, but I wholeheartedly agree with filtering tap water before use. Boiling it doesn't hurt either but some say this gives water a flat taste. A tip for storing the frozen cubes to insure there's no contamination from last years trout; store them in paper lunch/sandwich bags placed in a plastic ziploc bag. You can also just pop them into the plastic baggie. Trust me, they won't stick together.

I use bottled distilled water. Lot easier and purer.

I can't really tell a difference; however, I do drink Memphis, TN, water, which is rated among the best in the country. It was fun, though, to add spiders for Halloween.
