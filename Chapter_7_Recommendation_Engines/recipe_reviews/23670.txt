I have made this recipe twice in one weekend.  It is very good.  Here are some tips.  Use the 9 X 13 pan but you will need to reserve only about 3/4 C of crumb mixture- otherwise there won't be enough to pack into the pan.  I reserved all of the walnuts for the topping.  I added 1 TSP of Vanilla and subbed nutmeg for cinnamon. Oh one more thing... I used half a jar of jam for each batch.

These are a delicious healthy snack.....  I used all applesauce in place of the butter.  It makes a soft bottom crust, then i mixed 1 - 1 1/2 cups more oats into the remainder of the mix, to make it more crumbly for the top.
I used rasperry jam.
They're just the right amount of sweet.

We really like these. We were looking for a healthy treat, though, so I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the butter.  It added a really good flavor, reduced the fat, and I think helped the improve the crumbly factor other reviewers have mentioned--they stuck together just fine.  However, one reviewer said she left out the sugar entirely and put tons of jam so I tried to just put half the sugar and tons of jam.  It was okay but next time I'm just gonna put the sugar.  Half the sugar = breakfast snack (not a problem), but all the sugar = treat (yum!).

Yum! A little on the sweet side so it may benefit from a little less sugar and I found that I needed a whole cup of preserves rather than 3/4 cup. On the whole a very tasty recipe!

This came out WAY to crumbly and would not stay in squares. I basically served it like it was a cobbler or a crisp. The taste is ok but not the greatest, will not make again.

I omitted the nuts and used more oats (one person these were being served to has a nut allergy) and used blackberry jam.  I wanted to jazz them up a bit so I made a simple confectioner's sugar glaze with lemon juice and a little of the same jam used in the filling once they were completely cooled.  So quick and easy---delicious!

We LOVE these!! I find that 1 cup of fruit preserves is better then 3/4 cup and most of the time I do half strawberry or raspberry (my favorite) and half apricot or peach (dh's favorite).

Very tasty, and about as easy as one can get. These can be used as a cookie, or as a dessert with a puff of whipped cream or a curl or two of ice cream. Used 3/4 cup of butter, and to cut down on the "sweet" overload, used fruit spread rather than preserves. Apricot and cherry were winners at my church lunch! Will try it with the applesauce to see if that works....saving a few calories, maybe. Thanks for the recipe!!

I wanted something sweet and had limited ingredients available, but everything I needed to make these.  They're very easy to make and result in a very good bar.  I took the advice to reserve less for topping and use more in the base.  I also used more preserves than it calls for.  I wanted to know the preserves were there, not just get a hint of them.  I used strawberry because it was all I had enough of, and I used pecans because they were what I had.  I would make these again if I wanted a good cookie in a hurry.

These were so delicious, fast and easy to make. And it was great I got to use up some of the raspberry jam from our garden(we have more than we can shake a stick at). thank you so much for this recipe =] i'll definitely be making it again!

These are yummy! The only thing I found to be a bit better was to use shortening instead of butter (I tried it both ways). They came out a bit flakier and 'lighter' with the shortening.

Very good!  I cut it while it was warm but left it in the pan and let it firm up in the freezer, it cut into squares pretty easily after that.  I had my heart set on making these but all I had was a half stick of butter so I cut the recipe in half and made it in an 8 by 8 inch pan.  Next time I'll make the full batch:)  This may sound weird but I think I'll try it with marmalade in the middle next time.

Very good, my family loved them! I used Raspberry jelly.  Was thinking that natural peanut butter and jelly would be good to try next time.

I could eat a million of these and never get sick of them.  Not to mention, by simply switching the jam, its a completely dessert.  If you're really feeling bold, mix up a few different flavors of Jam in one batch and see what happens.

Excellent bars, and bonus is they are easy and relatively quick. I made for a school fundraiser. I took the tips from another reviewer which were VERY helpful--reserve only 3/4 - 1 cup oats mixture for the topping. Put all the walnuts in the topping, not the bottom. For those who say it's too crumbly, make sure to press the bottom down so it is firm, and cool completely, overnight. My advice is not to spread jam to the pan edge as it sticks terribly and burns. I cut these this morning and they are not crumbly at all--crispy crust and chewy center--the BEST.

Just made this for the first time and it was fantastic!  I cut them while still warm in the middle and I have to say it was the best thing ive put in my mouth in a while. Thank you so much for sharing this.  Definitely will make again.

This one is absolutely wonderful. I had to make it twice to get it right though. Word of advice... Do not substitute margarine for the butter.  It gives it a weird taste reminiscent of burnt rubber... or maybe that's just me.  When I made it with the butter, it was perfect!

These were pretty good- I made them for playgroup and the 1 and 2 year olds LOVED them, even the two picky eaters! The only thing I didn't like was that they ended up kind of crumbly- not the easiest to eat as a cookie. They did set up a little better the next day. The jelly also seemed to bake into the two layers- so it didn't have the layered effect I had wanted. BUT they tasted good- so I'll probably try them again.

I had some blackberry "all fruit " jam that was about to expire so I used it in this.  It was delicious! The only other changes I did were to use the Splenda brown sugar to cut calories and I also added a handful of dried cranberries for some crunch.

Excellent for breakfast or as a treat. I’ve made it exactly according to the recipe and everyone loved it. I also tried using fresh blueberries in place of jam. Equally tasty!

It's a good basic recipe.  I looked at mazurka recipes which are similar to this one and they used cold butter and included coconut.  So if I make it next time, I will do this.

I made some jam last year that the kids just did not want to eat. It had a flavor like apple butter, but was made from a combination of apples and end-of-season green tomatoes and I guess it was just asking too much to insist that we finish it before opening other jams I'd made. They pretty much stopped eating jam. Sigh...

Made this recipe using the homemade green tomato jam and the whole concoction was awesome and devoured. I have two more jars of the stuff and will definitely make this again.

It often makes me crazy when people don't make a recipe exactly as directed, then review it…but I made a couple of changes that may have detracted from the results - but not the flavor - and I wanted to share them.

I increased the recipe to 1.5 times the original and baked it in a jelly roll pan because I wanted to use more jam : )  I probably let the butter soften way too long as the mixture was really goopy. Or, maybe it was that I did as another reviewer suggested and put all the walnuts in the top portion of the mixture? Anyway, I just used a fork to spread the mixture over the bottom of the jelly roll pan, spread the layer of jam, then dropped the remaining mixture in small spoonfuls across the top of the thing. It worked out fine.

The recipe is pretty sweet for my taste, but I had absolutely no complaints from the kids or anyone else. It was so good that I served it for dessert to friends who came over for dinner. With a small scoop of vanilla ice cream it gets even better.

I hadn't made these for years! I used blueberry jam with blueberry chunks in and they are delicious. 18 minutes was almost too much. 16 minutes would probably have been better.

I made these plenty of times and they are awesome. When we get asked to parties these are asked to be made every time ! Strawberry jam is the best for sure.

This was a very easy recipe to make.  My whole family LOVED it!  It was gone in 2 days!  I will be making this one a couple times a month for sure.
