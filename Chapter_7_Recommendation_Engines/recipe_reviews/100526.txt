When this breakfast started frying up, the crowds came running. Then they started jostling each other to get to the goods. Everything looked, smelled, and tasted sooooo amazing! I didn't wash it down with a pint of Guiness...an excellent coffee had to do. Could I eat this every day? Sure! But I'd have fewer days in the long run, and I'd have to run 10 miles a day to work off the calories. It will have to be a once-in-a-while treat. But what a treat!

I made this for a special St. Patrick's Day breakfast for my family.  I love how fast and easy it was to make -- I made it all (minus boiling and mashing the potatoes the night before for the Farl) in 30 mins!  I did leave out the black pudding because after reading the ingredients it just didn't sound like something my family or I would like.  I had no idea how much this was going to yield!  I made everything to the specifications, and it was SO MUCH food!  I have a family of 4, and easily could have cut the recipe in half and still had plenty.  Like others have said, its not something you would want to have everyday - loaded with fat, carbs, and calories - but for a once-in-a-while treat, yum!

Growing up in an Irish family (Dad was from Northern Ireland) My dad got black pudding and Irish sausages from the Irish butcher shop, they are so good, I live in Pa,USA, now and I can't get black pudding or Irish sausage here. When I visited my relitives in Northern Ireland, they made me this breakfast and it's fantastic. Can't wait to go back.

I live in the States, but my Dad's from London, and I have many fond memories of having a "Full English Breakfast" very similar to this one as a kid.  For those of us who live in the States and can't get the Irish bacon, sausages and black pudding from our local stores, there are some US-based online companies who offer these goods.  I can personally recommend Tommy Moloney's I've ordered from them several times and have been very satisfied.  It costs a little more than what you'd find at the supermarket, because of the shipping, but it's worth the splurge every so often.  British/Irish rashers (bacon) and sausage are very different from the style we have here.  Their bacon is much less fatty than ours.  I love it!

I'm from Northern Ireland and you can get this entire meal for 99P or $1.50.  We treat ourselves for breakast, lunch or even dinner.  Recipes for potato farles and soda scones go back hundreds of years.

I made Ferg's Ulster Fry-up for last year's St Patrick's breakfast, & will make it again this year.  I didn't make the mushrooms & blood sausage because I don't like those foods. I made both the Potato & the Soda Farls (on this site, also by Ita). This was very tasty, tho' will enjoy it only a couple of times a year, as it is all fried in bacon fat. The tomato is a great & very tasty addition; its acidity helps to cut the fattiness. I liked the Potato Farl better than the Soda Farl (bread).

This is an excellent recipe. You can also add Cumberland sausage (particularly if you are Scottish!) and fried mushrooms and beans. As a Canadian, I recommend dousing it all in the best maple syrup you can find.

This has something for every one. I had a modified breakfast of eggs, farl and tomato, and skipped the meat. I was well satisfied, and really did not need to eat again until dinner. Farls are new to me, and I loved both types.

Belfast girl here to explain an ulster fry! An ulster fry is unique to ulster! I have one every weekend. It is a six county fry up ( an item for each county of ulster). Potato bread, soda bread, bacon, eggs, sausages and fried tomato or mushrooms, the last varies wherever you get it from. I've been eating ulster fries since I could chew and I have never had black pudding in my life, nor did my mummy, daddy, grandparents. It is an item from mainland united kingdom, also known as blood sausage? It originates from Lancashire. We don't have it in a traditional ulster fry here although a few hotels and restaurants have started to serve it over the years, along with hash browns, white pudding etc but it has no place in an ulster fry and I personally wouldn't be able to anything that shared a plate with it lol.

Hallo food lovers, an Ulster Fry is NOT a breakfast dish but a lunch or teatime meal not to be confused with an english breakfast which also has fried eggs and sausages. This is also one main reason that Northern Ireland has the highest rate of heart disease in europe, enjoy with HP sauce ( The Fry, not the heart disease !) Happy eating, your Alan.
