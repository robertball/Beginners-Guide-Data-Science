We were craving chocolate and only had chocolate syrup in the house. I baked this for almost 50 minutes and it never got firm. The edges were a little carmelized with a pudding like center.   update- I took a bite of this the following day and it was good! When it was warm it was too mushy but once it is completely cooled it's more like a gooey brownie.

I needed a quick chocolate fix and all I had in my house was chocolate syrup!  I only made half the batch because that's all I had and just put it in a 9x9 pan.  It was just what I needed.  Not too sweet and very moist.  Thanks!!!

This wasn't a cake--it was a pan of brownies. The taste was so-so--not chocolately enough for me.

I frosted this cake with whipped cream which added a nice light touch to this rich cake.
Also works well as a sheet cake.

Good chocolate fix without having to go to the grocery store. A little on the interesting side - it was like a mix between cake and brownies - but that could have been due to not frosting it.  I garnished it with confectioner's sugar instead of frosting, as that is what I had on hand.  Next time, I think it would be good with a simple orange glaze (reduction of confectioner's sugar and OJ - really easy) or with icing/frosting. Definitely tasted like chocolate syrup!

This was good because of the ease of making it. I'd recommend this for the kid crowd- I love flourless chocolate torte which has few rivals in chocoholic world. Note: chocolate syrup is measured by weight and not volume.

when i made this i split the ingredients into two seperate bowls and in one bowl i did one cup of chocolate syrup and half the ingredients required and the second bowl used 1 cup of strawberry syrup and other half of indredients and also added about 1/3 cup more flour to strawberry batter than chocolate then poured the chocolate batter in greased pan then the strawberry batter on top of the chocolate took a bamboo skewr and made swirl patterns bake for about 1 hour and 15 mins or until didnt stick to toothpick a whole lot...made homemade cream cheese icing and frosted after it cooled was delicious would even be great with carmel instead of strawberry...my 3 year old love it and loved helping make it

This had the taste and consistency of a very rich chocolate brownie.  If that's what you're looking for, you'll love this, but I myself was looking for more a more cake-like finished product.  (This was also very hard to remove from the pan for some reason--the syrup, maybe?? Even after greasing and flouring, I had to really dig this cake up to get it out of the pan.)  It was nice not to dirty many dishes making it, but this wasn't worth making again.

I changed a little bit the recipe, I didn’t add sugar because i used Hershey’s chocolate syrup and it is too sweet. I add one teaspoon baking soda as well. It is really delicious

I have tried this recipe and it kind of startled me on how great it is, because the picture looks kind of weird.

As easy as boxed brownie mix, and I was able to make it when I was craving something chocolatey and gooey but didn't have anything chocolate in my home. All ingredient is something I have at hand always, so this is a keeper!! Thank you!
