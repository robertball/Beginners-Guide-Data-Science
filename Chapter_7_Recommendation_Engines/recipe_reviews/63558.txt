Hubby's assessment is spot on: "Nondescript.  Just orzo." This is sadly lacking in flavor, even though I used an herb medley orzo.

I'm not a big pasta eater, but I could eat orzo or pastina anytime. Most of us only think of using fetticini with alfredo sauce so I was happy to stumble across this recipe. I doubled the sauce, used fat free half and half and much more cheese. We loved this Marilyn and the dish pairs very nicely with chicken franchese. Thanks!

Thought this was good.  I only made half the amount of orzo and maybe I used too much parmesan as it was a little grainy.  I added garlic powder and a dried herb mix that included red onion, chive and dill.  Had this with sweet and spicy salmon and it was a nice creamy accompaniment.  This is a good base recipe, suitable for tinkering.

My whole family liked this recipe.  I didn't add the nutmeg or the chives and I did add more cheese.  I used the pre-shredded stuff.  The only suggestion I had was from my husband who said he would like more cheese in it.  I might double the sauce next time and add some cooked chicken to it.

I thought this was pretty bland...And that's a lot, coming from me.  I'm the type of person that prefers "beige" food, so I thought this would be right up my alley.  It definitely was not.  I did use fresgly grated Parmesan, perhaps that made it more bland (???)...At any rate, I added some Italian Seasoning and a bit of salt.  It was edible, just not something I'll probably make again.

Yes I followed what others on the comments said and double the heavy cream and butter, I can't imagine how dry it would have been without doing that. I also added garlic powder, Italian Seasoning, and white pepper in addition to the nutmeg and chives already called for. This was a hit with my very picky kids!

This went great with the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan recipe from this site, but as written it's pretty bland. Tasted it as written before adding garlic powder, salt, and white pepper then it was pretty delicious. Used 2%  milk since I had no cream.

This recipe is a great base. I made it as written but I only made 1/3 of the recipe. It was rather boring. 
So, I made it a second time, making the full recipe but I doubled the sauce, holding out a bit in a small pitcher,  added fresh minced garlic saut√©ed  in butter, white pepper and paprika instead of nutmeg. I sprinkled on scallions and chives, added double the cheese and topped with a bit of parsley. It was spot on.  2 people added sauce from the pitcher and 2 decided it was just fine without any extra. 
I can see this is very versatile and many things can be added so that is just a bit different every time you make it. Think peas with some chunks of jamon or shrimp. Endless possibilities from a very simple base recipe.

So delicious! Easy side dish. The nutmeg is surprisingly perfect. Salted and peppered to taste, and probably used more cheese than the recipe calls for. The recipe halves perfectly for 4 people.

This was good, but I did a few things differently.  I also would've liked to add maybe white wine to the sauce, but didn't have it on hand.  I sauteed minced onions and garlic in butter, then added a touch of flour, then added milk and parmesean. I also toasted the orzo before dropping them to boil in chicken broth.  This dish was awesome! Very comforting!

While this was a little bland, it certainly lends itself to being a good side dish for a strong-flavored main dish.  I did add some other sauce to this when I finally served it tonight with my dinner.  This is a good base.  Thanks for the idea!
