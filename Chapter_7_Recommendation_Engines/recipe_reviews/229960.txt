I made this dish tonight; it turned out awesome.  I had some mushrooms I was looking to use and sauteed them with the shallots and garlic.  

One step that should be added is to reserve one cup of the pasta water, which should be added just prior to adding the pasta and shrimp.  This adds starch and helps give the sauce a smooth texture.

loved it! Unfortunately, we ate it before I remembered to add a photo. I like my food a little spicy, so I added more red pepper and salt. Easy and delicious. Try it, you won't regret it!

This dish was very easy and extremely tasty!! I'm so happy to find such an awesome dish to add to my favorites. 

Since I don't carry fresh lemons...and I'm usually a spur of the moment cook...I substituted the fresh lemon and pepper dashes with a Lemon Pepper seasoning. It turned out great and added the lemon flavor. :D

Excellent recipe.   I made as written and did not add the pasta water, as some have suggested.   I have no regrets in putting my trust in the author of the recipe.   I will definitely be making again.

Recommend holding back on lemon till last second. Reason? It is a fact known by all chefs...lemon will make shrimp a little bit tough when cooking the shrimps in it.
I follow instructions to the T, but add the lemon to the sauce last minute...just before pulling the meal from the burner!

I made this last night for Valentine's after remembering a similar dish my husband and I had on vacation.  I was really worried my husband wouldn't like it (he's picky about seafood dishes) but after one bite, he declared his approval and I squealed with delight.  This dish is amazing (and SUPER simple!)  I didn't have any shallots, but I used half a diced white onion and it was superb.  I think I also used a bit more butter than what was called for, but hey.  It's was Valentine's Day!  I left out the wine (again, didn't have any) but now that my husband likes it, I plan to sneak it in there the next time I make it...and there will be a next time.  The lemon makes it taste fresh and yummy and delicious.  I would say I'm looking forward to the leftovers, but we ate the whole thing!  I'm happy report that this will be making an appearance in our kitchen again and I'd love to try it with a combination of shrimp, lobster, and/or crab.  I truly can't say enough about this recipe.  It's great!

No sense messing with something that on its own is pretty darn good.  It's not necessary to measure precisely, just  use all ingredients to your heart's and eyes' content.  A squeeze of this, a handful of that and a splash of this - use what looks good to you.  And in my case, that meant more shrimp and  less pasta because Hubs and I aren't spring chickens anymore and have to watch our calories and carbs.  I served this with a simple green salad with a lemon vinaigrette.  Awesome good dinner.

Made this tonight for my family for Valentines, it was great!  It was easy!  It was relatively quick!  All pros in my book.  I made this as written and thought it was terrific. Great choice for a weeknight meal or Lent and nice enough for a special occasion.

Very tasty, was a tad dry. I'd recommend adding 1/2 - 1 cup of the pasta water to keep it moist.

Made as directed but also added 1 cup pasta water to sauce as suggested by one reviewer.  This was light, refreshing, delicious!  Will definitely make again!

This is a delicious recipe. I substituted dried Tarragon for parsley and used garlic infused olive oil. Loved it! I make this when I have left over boiled shrimp from shrimp cocktail. I toss the cooked shrimp in for about 1 1/2 min. to heat.

Great recipe!  Added parm/reg. cheese at the end. My husband has to have cheese on everything! Especially pasta.  Also I substituted chicken broth for the white wine.   Turned out great. Will make it again for sure!

I've been making this recipe for at least 10 years and I love it.  However, this is a Tyler Florence recipe.  The ingredients and directions are exactly Tyler Florence's.  Give credit where credit is due.  Don't steal.

The Wine Kills It. luckily, I tried the sauce before pouring it on my pasta and shrimp. The shrimp was very good. Next time I'll omit the wine and reduce the lemon, and it'll be great!

My kids beg me to make this weekly.  It is super easy and I follow the directions exactly.  I have found that using uncooked shrimp is better as the precooked shrimp does end up a bit rubbery (my kids don't care though).

We really liked this. I use Riesling bc it gives it a slightly sweet flavor. Used less pasta bc we are shrimp fans. And threw the shrimp in the back the wine/butter sauce for a minute to allow the flavors to have a quick affair (not long enough to marry) before throwing in with the pasta.

So simple, yet yummy!!  I made some substitutions--I used chicken broth in place of the white wine and orzo instead of linguine.  I really liked the orzo with it!!  I also sprinkled it with a little parmesan and cracked black pepper to finish.  This is a keeper!!

Excellent Recipe!  My husband loves pasta dishes. I did make a couple of additions. I added extra garlic and also onions and peppers. I would have added spinach also if I'd had any. I love to add veggies where possible.

Hey guys, this was a great recipe although I did make some adjustments! The recipe on it's own was lacking some UMPH. So I added diced mushrooms to the shallots, threw in some spinach near the end and tossed everything with just a liiiiittle lemon zest as well as parmesan. I also saved about a half cup (or less) of pasta water and added it as I needed to. LASTLY- I cooked my shrimp at the very end in a separate pan with oil, butter, garlic and salt and then poured the garlicky goodness directly on the pasta for added flavour. Ain't no time for pictures when something so delicious awaits...

Made this dish tonight and it was perfect. Of course I had to add my own special touch to the dish. I added 2 organic sweet mini peppers (sliced) and sauteed with the shallots and garlic. Oh man!! It was perfection in a skillet!

I made it the first time as written, but found it needed a bit more flavor. I started adding a few sliced mushrooms, and topping it with shredded parm and diced tomatoes before serving. Also, I now always use fresh basil instead of parsley. We love this dish so much this way!!

I liked this recipe very much (and so did my family) but I would have liked a little more specificity  in the amount of lemon and the time to simmer the white wine and lemon juice.

I enjoyed this easy Scampi.  I was in Mexico and made it for my family there.  I did make substitutions based on availability and Mexican tastes.  Angel Hair was not available so I used regular spaghetti noodles, cilantro for parsley, diced onion for shallots, diced dried hot peppers for the red pepper flakes. and a few other minor changes.
It was very tasty and enjoyed by the family.  I was asked to include this with my other "gringo" meals I prepare.  I will definitely make this again, at home and down Mexico way.

Had this almost identical dish at a restraunt in Portland OR, a place along the Columbia River called "Salty's".  However, just before it comes out of the sautee pan, they liberally sprinkle it with fresh parmesan, and then toss it a few times. It melts and clings to the ingredients, and is SO GOOD!!  Try it, you will love it!

It was ok on the first day.   Leftovers were awful; I had to throw the rest of it away.  This had nothing to do with the shrimp.   I think there was confusion on what a shallot consists of.   Is it one bulb or one clove?  Online investigation indicated that 1 shallot = 1 bulb.  However, shallots vary quite a bit in size.  As a result, my rendition turned out quite shallot -y.   This recipe needs to indicate the amount of shallots in TBSP.  I would be petrified to try it again without that information being included.

Very good...simple and flavorful. Often recipes for me are a starting point, as I tend to modify them to suit my likes and dislikes, but other than adding two extra tablespoons of butter for deglazing the pan, I stuck pretty close to the printed recipe. Unfortunately our small town grocery was out of shallots, so I used sweet yellow onion and it worked just fine. Next time I might add mushrooms, diced red bell pepper, and/or maybe some chopped spinach at the end with the parsley, but honestly this dish stands on its own. My husband and I made this together for Valentine's Day dinner, and served it with roasted fresh asparagus.

Added more butter and garlic and since I made my shrimp from raw, boiled the shells for 30 mins to make a stock and used that to beef up the flavor. All in all a most excellent dish. Would never leave out fresh lemon and fresh parsley in this dish. It is what makes it taste fresh and gives it that zing..that and a pinch of red pepper flake if you like it spicy!

Made this tonight and my family and i loved it. Perfect om a hot day after work. A suggestion was made in a review to save a cup of the pasta water to add to the liquid before you toss everything in...good suggestion!!! We did it and she was right.

I didn't have white wine, still delicious! This is a keeper. I would take the recommendation of another review next time and reserve a cup of pasta water to make a little smoother sauce. I added baby Bella mushrooms that needed to use and some capers. Yum!

This recipe was very bland. No flavor at all. Also, too much pasta. Half a box would have been ok.  Had to make this edible at the end by throwing in additional ingredients and seasonings.  Disappointed.

The shrimp were delicious, but this is way too much pasta for a pound of shrimp. If I make it again, I will cook only 8 oz. of pasta.

We like our food spicy so I added more red pepper. Because it's just the two of us, I cut the ingredients in half except for the lemon,  to keep that lemony zip. 

The first time I made it, I used a white wine that wasn't quite so dry and it does impact the taste a smidge. The 2nd time I made it, I still didn't have dry white wine, so I used dry vermouth which is a great dry white wine substitute and has a good shelf life. Other than that,  made it just like the recipe and hubby has loved it both times.

This dish came out very well! Wish I would have taken a photo. It wasn’t dry for me at all... when I cooked the shrimp it ended up making a gravy which added to the sauce at the end. Also one tip would be to use 3/4 of a bunch of fresh parsely. I like the green effect it gives and you have to use a lot of it to do so. So if you want that look of greens in your pasta, use a lot of parsley and it tastes really good as well. Also I seasoned my shrimp with garlic salt which added to the flavoring.

I just finished this dish and I wouldn't change a THING! Shrimp are perfectly tender, sauce is the perfect meld of lemon, white wine, garlic and shallots, and finished with the addition of butter and EVOO for smoothness; FANTASTIC! I will be making my this my go-to Scampi recipe! It would be equally delicious with Scsllops! Thanks for sharing

Simple , quick, and delicious. I did add a little Swiss Cheese because I was worried it might be too bland? It was awesome with the added cheese. May try it without the extra cheese next time though.

This recipie is so quick and simple it saved me a lot of time in the kitchen. Cooking with a 5 month old and a boyfriend that works 13 hr days makes it difficult to time things right. I loved this the only thing I would do differently is more garlic (this is a garlic loving household) and less olive oil.

Very tasty! I used jumbo raw shrimp. My experience with already cooked shrimp is that there isn't nearly as much flavor when  used in a recipe. I also added fresh mushrooms and shallots.

I will make it again. Next time I will add a bit more red pepper to spice it up slightly. I also used 2 lemons instead of one. The 16oz. of pasta was about double what I needed for 4 people.

Made this as a special meal for my grandson, who loves shrimp.  He said, "It was yummy."  My daughter suggested, when I said I thought it needed more lemon that maybe adding some lemon zest would punch up the lemon flavour.  We will try that next time.

This recipe was easy and quick to make. We loved the flavors and will make again and again. We prepared as written except we used spinach linguini and also added artichokes. Next time we will add half the pasta as we are only serving two. It was a little dry with 16 oz.

Great recipe.  This is my go to recipe whenever I want to make shrimp scampi.  I add a little more liquids so it can have more sauce.  I also added more seasonings to taste including garlic salt.

This recipe was disappointing. There was not enough sauce for the pasta. It left the noodles dry. The dish as a whole cooled off too quickly leaving us with dry, cold noodles. I will look for a  different recipe with a creamy, thicker sauce.

Made this in a pinch for dinner. I used 8 ounces of linguine, a lot more garlic, quarter of an onion, and omitted the lemon juice and white wine. I used a bit less olive oil and butter than the recipe called for and the sauce was a nice coating nonetheless. Salt and pepper generously to maximize the simple flavors of this dish. Great nonfussy and quick recipe!

Amazing!!!!! Even the pickiest eater loved it! I added seasoned pieces of chicken breast. I had to make two substitutions because of what I had on hand...I used diced onion instead of shallots and 1/2cup of Gingerale in place of the dry white wine. I also used more garlic because we love it!

What?  No parmesan?  Then it's not Scampi, the sauce was good, but to much pasta so it turned out dry.

Super easy recipe. I followed the directions on everything except I didn't use linguine because all I had was spaghetti pasta but it still came out perfect. This was my first time making a pasta dish without any actual sauce. I have never eaten a dish without any Alfredo, Mariana or pesto sauce but using butter, lemon juice and wine was the perfect combination. This dish is super easy and clear, and it doesn't take a long time either. My husband and I loved this dish and I look forward to making it again.

Very good recipe! Personal but apparently futile crusade: Please don't use the words "shrimp" and "scampi" together in recipe titles. "Scampi" is the Italian word for "shrimp", so you are essentially saying SHRIMP-SHRIMP! This has been a trend for years on menus and in recipes (it's all over Allrecipes.com), but REALLY?  Let's just not :)

Not a review, really, but "scampi" is Italian for "large shrimp."   The real name for this recipe in English is "Large shrimp with Garlic." (Scampi alla Griglia." ) (sp)  I think the garlic should be increased to at least three cloves.

It turned out a big family hit! I added a little more than the pinch of the pepper flakes (I love the added spice). Next time I will save a cup or so of the pasta water to thicken up the overall sauce, but it will definitely be made again and again!

I made it last night.  I have had this recipe for some time from another  cooking site.  It is quick, easy  and pleasant.    I am very puzzled by the name 'shrimp scampi'.  This word in the English language means giant prawns.  So the title of the recipe is prawns prawns..  Strange!

Great, simple recipe.  Thank you to all for posting your creations!  I use these as a "jumping-off" point and add/adjust accordingly.  Made this dish tonight and it was superb.  Added asparagus, red/yellow peppers.  Thanks for posting!

This was very good. Although for a pound of linguine I would add more shrimp. I also used Paul Prudhommes Seafood Magic on the shrimp versus salt. It added a nice flavor. You can be generous with it.

I am a pasta fiend, and this is one of my go to pasta dishes that  I have  made several times now. Just made it last week when my boyfriend's  brother and  cousin came to visit for dinner and I heard nothing but praise and how  'fire' (that's good) it was. It is a light, fresh, satisfying dish, I follow it to the T only I add some fresh lemon zest to add to the crispness of the flavor.

The shrimp tasted wonderful, but the sauce was a little too little to sustain all of the pasta. Like other posters said it was a little dry. If I make it again, I'll double the sauce.

LOVE this! Made it a bunch of times and it always comes out great regardless of what we use. Very similar to our favorite authentic restaurant. Added some sautéed mushrooms and used leeks... sometimes we leave out the shrimp and just use bell peppers and mushrooms. Always, always good!

Very good!   It seemed a bit simple at first, but we followed the directions and added a few extras, a dash of celery salt and Lawry's Garlic salt and it was fantastic.  My 7 year old who typically takes ages to eat his dinner, gobbled this all up in minutes and had seconds!   That's saying volumes.

I tried this but didn't add the lemon juice and added diced tomatoes and spinach and pine nuts with parmesan cheese.  It was delicious! i also went extra with the garlic and butter.  Definitely not a diet food, but delicious!

This was really good.  I made it without the red pepper flakes, since my daughter will not eat anything with red-pepper flakes.  It is pretty easy to make.  I added a couple of extra cloves of garlic.

This delicious dish was very easy to make. I added an extra 1/4 cup of white wine instead of the lemon juice, which I think gave it a richer, winter flavor.

This was just okay for us.  I made it exactly as written but did add the one cup of pasta water as suggested by others who gave this recipe higher reviews.  I felt this dish did not have enough depth of flavor; all we really tasted was lemon.  I'd probably up the garlic, decrease the lemon and reduce the sauce more if I bothered to make it again.  Personally I like Ina Garten's recipe much better so I'll probably stick to that in the future.

I used 1.5 pounds of shrimp and 2 tbsp extra of butter to help cook it. I forgot about the parsley. It tasted amazing! I will make this again... with the parsley.

I added some lemon essential oil to the pasta water, which I have never done before. AMAZING. I used onion instead of shallots and I used some lemon olive oil too from the olive oil store in the 2nd olive oil addition. My kids thought it needed more flavor but I think that is because we are addicted to bad foods. It was very natural and healthy tasting. I also used about 2 pounds of shrimp. Yum

It was excellent. I added a couple more cloves of garlic & it was better than any shrimp scampi I've had in a restaurant. Cheers! Chef Jeanne

This was super easy to make and didn’t take much time which is exactly what I was looking for. I skipped the red pepper flakes and used angel hair pasta but otherwise as written. I will definitely be making it again.

Made it a few times.  Made some changes just because I had some produce at home and didn't want to go shopping for two shallots and dry white wine.  
I substituted onions for shallots, dry white wine for just cooking wine.  I didn't use much or the red pepper flakes just because it was too much.    
Great recipe!  I learned to have the ingredients ready, so when I start cooking, it goes really fast.

Delish!  The only change I made was to add a few sun-dried tomatoes at the end, when I added the parsley. It made it more colorful (for Christmas) and tasty (I love sun-dried tomatoes). I will definitely be making this again...my guests loved it!  I may just make it for myself!

This recipe was really great and easy to make changed to for personal needs! I did make some modifications: 
I used shrimp that had not been peeled yet and used those shells (plus the garlic peels and lemon rinds) to make a shrimp stock that I used in place of the white wine. I seasoned the butter/oil mixture with onion power, finely chopped garlic, and old bay seasoning (NO red pepper flakes). I noticed that when I put the lemon/shrimp stock/butter mixture together that the sauce was going to be too thin to hold to the pasta (I used spaghetti) so I mixed up a tiny amount of cornstarch and cold water to help thicken it. Added extra lemon juice and lemon zest (1 lemon worth). This recipe was easy, delicious, and impressive! The ingredients for the entire recipe only cost about $15 which is a nice, budget friendly date night.

This was quite easy to make with easy ingredients. We thought it was good, but needed a little something. Next time I’m going to add a scampi seasoning when I add the wine.   I added the lemon juice at the very end and I added the pasta “juice” as other reviews recommended.   Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing as is! The only change I made was that I used angel hair pasta instead of linguine. I also use frozen shrimp from Trader Joe’s. I run the shrimp under cold water to defrost them a bit. I’ve made it twice & both times my husband and I cleaned our plates!

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it (family of 6). Being Mexican, I love everything spicy so o added a LOT more of the crushed red pepper and I used chicken broth instead of wine. It turned out great. I also added broccoli to make it more since I only had 2 lbs shrimp. Everyone wanted to take leftovers for lunch tomorrow......but....there’s none left!!!!

This Scampi sauce had the most reviews, and favorable ones.  So, I went with this recipe.  I adjusted the quantity of the recipe, from 6 servings to 8 servings. Because, I wanted leftovers. 

Full disclosure: I didn't have shallots in the house. So, I minced onion (based on another reviewers suggestion), and added that in. I also forgot to add the parsley and; didn't even miss it. My husband and I thought it was okay, but not flavorful enough; and I added extra seasoning; too!  My older teen liked it, and my younger teen didn't.  I enjoy cooking, and usually have good success with this site. However, I won't make this particular recipe again.

I doubled the sauce ingredients used spaghettini, and added some parmesan on top before serving. My seasonings my have been a bit loose, the red pepper flakes were a nice little kick. I have a hard time measuring things, I prefer to wing it. My husband is not a pasta person but he ate every strand and licked the bowl. Definitely a keeper!!

Fabulous recipe! Quick and easy. I added 1 tablespoon of rehydrated red pepper flakes and used rice noodles instead of linguine.  Will certainly make again and again!!

Shrimp scampi wasn't always my dish but now I can make it and know what's in it. Truly a great recipe :)

So good! I used precooked shrimp so I reduced the time I headed it. Definitely save a little bit of the pasta water to add to the sauce. I will make this again and again!

Just made this ten minutes ago, absolutely phenomenal!  Such a simple recipe that yields exceptional results.  The sauce comes out thick and rich, with a delicious lemon tang. I highly suggest this recipe to anyone and everyone!

This was delicious, but I have something to say about what is happening to this website.  It was the only one I could get and what made me stick to it that did not have constant ads popping up in our face, or ads that looked like recipe and you get caught if you go into them, etc.  I got hacked like this and now have to change my credit card number, so beware.  If this continues to get worse, it will be the end of my viewing these recipes ....how sad because I love them.

My teen son made this tonight and it was a hit! I think next time we'll double the shrimp and sauce to get the pasta to topping ratio more to our personal preference. Thanks for sharing such a quick and easy recipe. We had all ingredients on hand!

Big hit and definitely a repeat recipe. I added fresh sliced mushroom to the sauté step, forgot the lemon and parsley. They weren’t missed. I used about 1/4-1/2 cup homemade chicken stock instead of wine.  At the end I used a bit of pasta water to keep it moist.

This is a long process, but other than that It is very good. I actually use Italian Sausage and zucchini instead of shrimp. I also added an extra 1/4  cup of the wine to make it more moist. I used Linguine pasta because I like the size of it. I mainly just used this recipe for the sauce! (-:

This recipe is really delicious. The lemon & white wine really make it. I'm going to try it again with linguini noodles since the angel hair pasta I used didn't seem to go well from a texture point.

This is delicious.  I did have to substitute a few ingredients just because I did not have them.  Used onion instead of shallots, garlic powder instead of garlic, lemon juice instead of juicing a fresh lemon, and I did not have any parsley.  It was still wonderful.  Even my picky husband loved it!

I made this recipe exactly as written, other than the optional red peppers flakes because my kids don’t like spicy food. It was DELICIOUS! And so easy, it took as long to make as it does to boil the pasta! We’ll keep this recipe in our weekly rotation.

We really liked this.  It lends itself to a lot of change and still tastes great.  I was cooking from what I had, so I used some really good scallops I already had in the freezer.  I followed the rest of the recipe and some other reviews.  I added mushrooms and kept about 1/3 cup or so of the pasta water, which I did need.  We added some grated parmesan to the top.  Even my 4 yr old liked it! I will try this will shrimp next time.  Thanks for sharing and reviewers tips too.

Quite tasty. Entirely too much grease called for. Will do with 1/3 to 1/2 next time. Marinating shrimp in salt garlic olive pile helps flavor.

I've made this many times now. I love it! I have made a few omissions. I omitted the parsley. Not a fan of it.  I've also made it without the wine (forgot to buy it) and it still tastes great. I also like to top mine with some FRESH  parmesan cheese. Never the powder in a can! My husband doesn't use it, so I add mine separately.  A nice piece of bakery bread and a salad is always a plus! Bon appetite!

This  is good as is. I would recommend adding 1/4-1/2 C Parmesan to the recipe at the end. Also perhaps a touch of lemon zest . I  omit the hot pepper flakes as it  can overpower the subtle flavor of the shrimp and can always be added on to an individuals own serving.

Made this for Good Friday and it turned out great. 
I did double the garlic because you can never have too much garlic. Also used chicken broth instead of wine as I didn't have any. And added roasted vegetables because I did have them and they worked great with it.

No substitutions necessary.  My husband loved it so much that he ate the entire dinner except for the portion I ate!  It was a winner.

Excellent!  Tripled the sauce, doubled the pasta.  Three pounds shrimp and one and a half pounds of scallops.

Made exactly as instructed, and it was good! Next time, I may add a little more wine and lemon juice, but very good as-is.

This was really good! My husband loved this. I did alter the recipe a tad by adding some extra garlic and garlic powder and upping the red pepper flakes. I agree with other reviewers that it was a tad dry -- so next time I will reserve some pasta water as others suggested. I topped the dish off with shaved Parmesan.

Angel hair works just as well, if not better than linguine. Your choice. At any rate, this is an excellent recipe!

I made this pretty much to the recipe. Everyone LOVED it. It was a little dry. Next time, I will add a little more butter and, oil. But, great flavors. This will be a go to recipe.

Followed the recipe to a "T" (except not using near as much pasta) and mine turned out bland and the lemon was overpowering.  I agree that a measurement on the lemon juice would probably be a good idea.  Doctored it up with garlic salt, freshly grated parmesean & asiago and some heavy cream and it was better.

Anyone that didn't like this dish either can't cook or can't taste. No one can control the size of your lemons, garlic cloves, pinch of salt size, type of wine, etc. I used green onions instead of shallots. I like garlic, so obviously used more than recommended. Specifically used Barefoot Pinot Grigio. More olive oil than recommended, went by sight and texture while cooking after recipe amount didn't seem sufficient. Most importantly, sampled while cooking and added what I needed to suit my palate.
To complicate it even more, kids don't like shrimp, so I actually made 2 batches, one with shrimp and the other with chicken breast. Both were amazing and now I'm roped into making it again for wife's family as well, 12 people total. 
This is now one of our families regular recipes.

My cooking expertise extends to opening cans, frozen food containers, and hitting start on the microwave, but this makes me feel like a bonafide chef. Very easy to make, tasty, and plenty of leftovers. Following the instructions strictly it came out a bit too oily so I reduced the olive oil a tad.

This is a quick and easy recipe and almost identical to one I've been making for years. I used dried Italian parsley since I didn't have any fresh. My family loves it! It's great for a last minute quick meal as the shrimp can be thawed quickly in cold water.

Delish!  Did top with parm and added a bit of the pasta water; needed a little liquid and the water is less caloric than adding more butter!  Awesome recipe, thanks!

Added garlic to the scampi sauce (in addition to the garlic with the shrimp. Also added fresh spinach to the sauce and let it wilt before adding the linguini. Did not add extra oil before serving. Was a hit!

Sauteed the shrimp before I put the condiments in the skillet. Also added a bit of chicken broth to thin the sauce out a bit and to cover the amount of pasta I used.

Wonderful simple recipe. I needed to make minor substitutions . I didn’t have any red pepper flakes so I used a generous tablespoon of salsa and some red pepper bruschetta. It seemed too spicy for my taste buds so I added a splash of  heavy cream. For a bit of color contrast I chopped  up a cup of fresh spinach . I had some fresh mushrooms I wanted to use so I sliced them up and added them. While I made some additions and substitutions I think the original recipe still stands very well as it was originally written. I used a pasta that looked like a small open tulip. The pasta would need to be thin or like a linguine.

Really really good as is.  Second time my wife wanted some cherry tomatoes and capers added, and threw in some goat cheese just before serving as well.  Whoa!  This went into the "Keeper" pile.

Very easy to make minimal chopping.  Made with half chicken and half shrimp.  Cooking chicken until no longer pink then added shrimp.

I omitted shallots, wine, and used dried parsley. I seasoned tghe shrimp with a Tbs of old bay instead of salt and pepper for extra flavor.

Loved it. Simmered the wine for about 7 minutes to let it reduce and cook down the wine. Also added some oregano and a few tablespoons of garlic powder (at the end to mix in with the pasta and everything) and 3 cloves garlic instead of 2. I normally dont make recipes exact, not even close, but this recipe nailed shrimp scampi. Excellent work.

This recipe is easy and delicious. Made it just as the recipe calls, didn't change a thing.  2nd time I made it I cut out the pasta and used spaghetti squash and that was delicious.  Thanks for this recipe will be making it quite often.

This s a great recipe!  I made it  the first time exactly as written and would give a 4 star. BUT it gave me the basis for my own  tastes.  Being in Louisiana, I had to add  a touch of  Cajun seasoning - just 1/2 tsp.  And then I added about 2  tbsp or so of minced tasso ham (but bacon would work, too) for a slightly smokey flavor. I  used chopped fresh spinach instead of parsley.  I agree with others that 1 lb of pasta is too much - I had double d the recipe and used about 3/4 of the pasta.  But this  is a winner to get  started.  If I was in a hurry,  the basic recipe is still great!

This was delicious!  We made it almost exactly as the recipe said, except for adding some pasta water as suggested by others. Also i didn't have a lemon so i added a couple tablespoons of bottled lemon juice. Great flavour. Just had to allow it to simmer for about 5 to 10 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken.

Very nice, easy and delicious.  I would use a little less lemon next time ...... and I added 1 Tablespoon extra each of the butter and olive oil.  Made it the perfect amount of sauce without drowning

I halved the recipe for two of us. I would cut the lemon back drastically - the pasta had way too much lemon flavor. One tablespoon may have been enough, 1/2 lemon was too much. I doubled the garlic and it could have used more garlic flavor as well. I will try another scampi recipe next time.

Have made this several times, and have always loved it. Season freely with red pepper - some will top with parmesan when served, as well.  Super easy and quick! Served with roasted brussel sprouts recently; nice addition to the meal.

So simple my 15 year old made this tonight and as is it was very good! Next time we will make a little more sauce and add some Parmesan cheese. Give it a try. It won’t disappoint. I will be adding this into our rotation for sure.

Wow, this turned out amazing. Cooked the shrimp a tad longer than advised, but my skillet is smaller. Also did light parsley mixed with the pasta and added a small amount on top of the plate before serving. Will make again for sure.

Wonderful! We had a pretty crazy rain storm today, and we didn't feel like going to the store. We had some frozen shrimp, and after a quick ingredient search, this recipe looked like it would work with what we had on hand. I didn't have any shallots, so I substituted a bit of finely minced yellow onion instead. I also used a dash of cayenne because we were out of red pepper flakes. I upped the garlic to four cloves (just because my family really likes garlic). It came out great, but I ended up only using about half the pasta, so I'd suggest only cooking half a package.

Through this one together with cheesy garlic bread. It was amazing mostly because my man was hungry and I was running late. It was quick and easy it was also incredibly delish and elegant. Thank you for the amazing recipe. Now everyone is satisfied.

There are a lot of shrimp scampi recipes on this site. This is the only one I found that was more complex than a simple butter sauce. It was so flavorful! The only thing I changed was I didn't add the extra olive oil at the end, but added parmesan cheese.

Good, but WAY too much oil and butter. 4+ tablespoons?! It is almost dripping off the noodles. i will use 2 tablespoons of each in the shallot cooking, but in the wine mixture I would use closer to 1 of each or less and dont add the extra drizzle. 3 tbsp of oil and 3 tbsp of butter will be plenty for goodness sake.

I listened to previous reviews  and added the cup of pasta water  when I  mixed in the shrimp and the pasta. I also waited until the end to add the lemon juice.  This was delicious. It will become a staple in my recipes.

I tried this recipe tonight and my husband and I agreed that it is a "keeper".  I halved the recipe for the two of us and it was very good, but next time I would add a little more seasoning.  I was conservative on the red pepper flakes, but it could have used more.  We are not big on oily dishes, so I did not add the olive oil at the end.  We just added some fresh lemon juice at the table and the dish was wonderful.  Will definitely serve this again when the ex-large, wild caught shrimp are on sale.

Followed the recipe but there was essentially no flavor. Ended up adding some more parsley to it along with some basil and garlic powder just to give it something. It is a good base to work from though, I look forward to tweaking and experimenting.

I made this and it was very good. I didn’t put 5 stars b/c I didn’t have all the ingredients so I am rating a altered version. I didn’t have shallots, greens or white wine sauce. I used regular onion like 1/4 of one instead of shallots. I used the butter, lemon, and oil (olive oil). Even thrown together like this it was so tasty. I think I’m going to get the extra ingredients for next time as it promises to be really good.

Perfect. I don’t drink so never have wine on hand, which bugs me when it comes to cooking. I’m sure that would have given the dish 10 stars. Lol. As is my family gobbled it up like starving cavemen??. Thanks. I will buy a little wine next week when I make it again, unless someone knows a wine substitute I could use. I almost tried white balsamic vinegar but was afraid of ruining dish. Ty for a really nice recipe

If you live in Pensacola you’ll get fresh shrimp at Joe Patti’s. They sell a scampi butter that is condensed with the wine & seasonings. Just braise the shrimp slightly  with garlic & shallots in butter -and then you add this $2 Joe Patti’s and let it melt in. And I use fresh Parm to mix with Angel Hair.  THE ONLY WAY A RESTAURANT IS BETTER IS THEY WASH THE DISHES & CLEANUP AFTER!!!

I didn't add the pepper flakes and it tasted great. I also used only half of linguine box and that is good for like 2-2 1/2 meals. It's smelled great and tastes great. I might have been a bit hesitant on the salt and pepper when mixing the shrimp because I was worried it would overwhelm the taste. GREAT dish! If only I didn't have to use so much butter!

My husband and I love this dish. I add another clove or 2 of garlic and some fresh basil and oregano when sautéing the shallots. I also add a 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese to the lemon wine sauce. This last time I substituted an olive-oil based margarine for 1/2 the butter - it still tasted great and my husband couldn’t tell the difference.

I love this recipe,every time I make it my husband and children clean the plate. I never can take a picture because it's not on the stove long. I used fresh basil this time instead of fresh parsley only because my local grocery store was out of parsley. It was still a great flavor.

Changed 2 garlic cloves to 3 large cloves.  Had to add a LOT more salt & pepper, then Parmesan, just to find a little flavor.  Was very bland and I should’ve listened to reviewers who said there wasn’t enough “sauce”.  Wasted 1/2 cup from a $40 bottle of wine to make this recipe ??

I followed the recipe with what I had on hand, so I left out the shallots, the red pepper, and the parsley, but  added more garlic.  We really enjoyed it.  When I told my husband that I would go to the store the next day and get the left out ingredients so we could have it a second time, he said not to bother.  He liked it just the way it was without them.  But next time, I would like to add the shallots and parsley.  Great recipe!

Don't know where to begin except have everything ready before starting. Took others suggestions & used a little lemon pepper instead of lemon juice & added mushrooms. What I'll do different next time is after the red pepper flakes, garlic & shallots are done it says to add shrimp. The shrimp pick up the flavors great! My problem was when all mixed together you couldn't get any flavor from the pasta. What I'll do is saute more red pepper, garlic & shallots w/mushrooms, then add white wine & lemon pepper & finally mix with the shrimp & linguine. We figured this way we'd get flavor with the shrimp & with the pasta.

Excellent recipe. I just added a little more of everything except for the 1lb of linguine. Next time I make this dish, I’m going to reduce the amount by 1/3. I also reserved 1 cup of the noodle water to mix with the sauce when adding the wine etc. thank you so much you this excellent recipe. This is now my best shrimp recipe.

I made it. I doubled the butter at both places. I also added mushrooms that I cooked (before adding) with 2 tablespoons of butter and a tablespoon of Texas Pete.  Only other change, I doubled amount of red pepper flakes. 
My sons and wife loved it almost as much as I did. ??

So good! Probably one of the best dinners I've ever made! I had to substitute red onions for shallots, and I added a little pasta water at the end per other reviewers. The family gobbled it up. It was so delicious!

I used whole wheat thin  spaghetti instead  of linguine and added an extra half of cup of dry white wine and extra olive oil. My guests enjoyed this dish and it was very simple to prepare.

Made shrimp scampi recipe and it was so delicious. I didn't have white wine, so I substituted with chicken broth. It was so easy and delicious.

I have made this dozens of times as it is very good. I do find it needs more salt than called for and I like to sprinkle 1/2 cup parmesan over it before serving. Every time its made I think, 'yum!'

Our family loved your recipe! It was delicious! I stuck to the recipe except I added one extra garlic clove because I love garlic and after plating, I topped each serving with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Everyone said they want me to make it again. Thank you!

This was really really good!  The flavors are perfect!  Used this recipe exact however I did double the "sauce" so our pasta was a bit more saturated.  Kids devoured this!  Thank you.

It was an easy recipe and I would make it again, I was a little surprised that the sauce disappeared.  I added pasta water to it but it seemed to dilute it.  I would like more olive oil and butter.  That will be  a change I will make the next time I make it.  Trust me their will be a next time.

I'd use 1.5 lemons, as it was a bit too sour. Also, I feel the pepper flakes are mandatory, as it cuts the bitter/sour from the lemon juice/wine mixture. Also, a clove more garlic.

I used gluten free pasta and prawns instead of shrimp which was delicious, everyone thorughly enjoyed it! I did not  use the dry white wine, so I noticed it was missing a little extra something. It may have needed more lemon juice on the prawns. I added sliced cherry tomatoes for colour and presentation and thought you could easily add pine nuts or even a little bit of parmesan for a bit of added flavour, Either way I will most definitely be making this again!

I’m very happy with this recipe. Both my husband and I loved it. My husband suggested to add saffron to the shrimp. He marinaded the shrimp in saffron. Soak a pinch of finely minced saffron in 1oz of almost boiling water, cover it and steep until cooled (15 minutes). Marinade shrimp with the saffron water with pepper for 15 minutes. Then add to the dish as directed.

I did make a few changes.  I added mushrooms and spinach.  Additionally, I like my scampi saucy!!!  So I doubled the recipe for the sauce to ensure it was enough for my taste.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed this dish and went back for seconds!!!!  This will definitely be a keeper!!!!

I like the recipe, simple enough, and most of the ingredients are things one usually has in the kitchen.  That said, it came out too sour.  I think next time I will only use half a lemon, instead of 1 whole one.  It didn't have enough sauce;  good thing I only used half of the pasta the recipe called for.  I also added in some of the pasta water (as one reviewer suggested) and cooked shrimp juice, both of which helped tone down the sourness.  Last thing, it did not come out creamy.  I would have liked it thicker and creamier, like Red Lobster shrimp scampi.

I would make it again, but next time I would use only half of the lemon, either cut back more on the noodle or make more sauce, and maybe add some cream.

I followed recipe exactly. always do when it's the first time I'm making something. I think it was ok filled out bellies but was lacking something. I may double the sauce next time but without so much olive oil. I feel that flavor came through the most but I was expecting a more lemony scampi flavor. I was also out of chili flakes so that could've been the tie together?

Made as directed but used fresh basil and oregano instead of parsley. It was good but next time I will add more garlic and cut back on the oil added at the end.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I could taste the lemon which I love. My husband and I made this recipe as is and tried a few bites. It wasn't necessarily dry, but I thought it needed a bit more "wetness," so I added some pasta water, maybe an 1/8 cup. My husband didn't like the flavor of the dish before the pasta water or after. LOL He is very picky though. He wasn't a fan and wouldn't want this again, but I enjoyed it very much!

I really liked it but the only down side was my noodles were very dry. I think next time save some sauce or cut back on some of the noodles. Other than that we LOVED IT!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  Modifications:  I did 3 pinches of red pepper; for this amount of pasta, I don’t know how one would come through at all.  We topped with parm cheese, which provided a much needed burst of flavor.  Underlying flavor with sauce is very good and I wouldn’t want that to be any stronger, but it doesn’t provided any burst of flavor.  Otherwise absolutely perfect as is!

Wonderful recipe, my family enjoyed it very much.  I used onion instead of shallot since that’s what I have.  I started sauté the onion once the water was boiled and pasta was cooking in the pot.  By the time the pasta was cooked just right, the sauce was ready and I strained the pasta from the pot and transferred directly into the sauce.  The entire dish from start to finish took less than half hour, while the dish tasted like I had slaved in the kitchen for hours.  If you want a dish that is both easy and a crowd pleaser, try this one for sure.

Made this for guests and it was outstanding. Used fresh linguinie and added snow peas. My husband isn't a shrimp lover but he rated it one of my best meals. Served with mixed greens and strawberry salad and ciabatta.

This was awesome! I wanted some asparagus so cut into 1" pieces and added to the butter and olive oil before the garlic and shallots, about 3 mins,  I used cooked ,large shrimp, thawed but I didn't add them until after the sauce was done and I turned the heat off. Added the pasta and shazamm!

It was really delicious.  I did use a cup of the boiled water from the pasta as previously suggested, and it worked out well.  I boiled my shrimp 90 sec. before I put in the frying pan to mix with the other ingredients.  Loved it and will fix it again for sure!

Very good. I was late getting home so my wife started the pasta and sauce while I cleaned the shrimp.
Dinner was ready in 15 minutes and delicious. Between the four of us there wasn't a bite left.

I think this would be a decent low carb dish - substituting spaghetti squash or zoodles.   Would be great to know the nutritional content without the linguine

Made this for the first time and the family loved it.  Only gave it a four star due to the fact that I could have tweaked it more with the garlic and more pepper flakes.  Used cilantro vs parsley just cause i like the fresh taste it adds.

Thank you for this recipe!  I'm sure it will become a go to meal with us.

I didn't have shallots so I used finely diced Vidalia onion. I also used fully cooked shrimp deveined with tails. Other than that everything was done the same. My husband liked it, but he had never had shrimp scampi before. It didn't taste  like any shrimp scampi I'd ever had nor did it taste as scrumptious.  So I guess it's all in one's interpretation of good. I will look for a different recipe for next time. I really like heavy garlic and lots of butter.  Possibly the lemon juice and wine killed that for this recipe. But you never know until you try it.

I have made this dish twice now..exactly as directed and with adjustments. First off, I love it, but my family finds it far to lemony, so the second time I used juice of 1/2 lemon. Still too lemony they say. Next time I will use 1/4. Secondly, I have a hard time not burning the garlic while trying to cook the shrimp. It helped to use smaller shrimp the second time.

Excellent! I doubled the sauce and used 1.5 lbs. of shrimp with linguine. In lieu of wine and pasta water I used about 2 cups of chicken broth. Used juice of two lemons, 4 tablespoons,  for sauce and served with lemon wedges.

I make sure that I use NON-GMO  linguine. I also use Aztec UNrefined sea salt (always!) (I do not use Kosher salt). 
I rate this recipe a big 5-star, and serve it w/a salad of baby spinach (organic, of course), Kalamato olives (halved), baby grape tomatoes (halved), fresh organic baby Bella’s, and a jar of mandarin oranges. Have a spritzing bottle of red wine vinegar and organic Avocado oil standing by.
You need to double up on everything if you want leftovers!

I didn't have a lime, so I used some of the Nestle lemon water I drink instead.  Otherwise, everything was the same and both my husband and I loved it!  I probably used more scallions and garlic than called for, but it only made it tastier, in my opinion.  Cooked it in a cast iron frying pan.

This is actually the 3rd time I’ve made this dish and it was awesome as always. I used 3 cloves of garlic and the curly parsley.  This time for the white wine I used a brut champagne from Spain which I think made this batch better than my other 2.  Will recommend this recipe to friends and family.

Outrageously good! Easy, fresh and beyond 5 stars! I doubled the sauce recipe and also addd a cup of pasta water. I used jumbo shrimp and substituted the wine for chicken broth...I can’t count how many times my husband raved about it! Top of my remake list!

This is my quick and easy, go to for the week nights.  For a low carb option try zoodles. Just as good! As written is great but it won't hurt if you add more garlic here and there.  As a topping option try "nutritional (NOT traditional or you'll be disappointed). Gives you a cheesy flavor without the dairy.  Great recipe!

I love this recipe with one exception, half the amount of pasta. If you use a whole 16 oz box of pasta I can't see how there would be nearly enough sauce or shrimp, you would pretty much just be eating pasta. Half the pasta and its so good

My sons really enjoyed this pasta, said it was restaurant quality. My pasta was 375 g which was fine as it made 4 good sized servings. It was a bit dry so I added a few ladles of pasta water to the pasta and sauce, before adding the shrimps back in.

I like ver the flavor, however it turned out to watery and a bit tart due to the lemon juice that it called for . I’ll make it again just to make sure I did it right . I love All recepies from this site!!

I make this recipe more than any other of my many MANY saved Allrecipes gems. I've also made this in a "Oh surprise! Here's very unexpected and important people I neglected to tell you were coming over, hi honey!" situation! Other than fresh parsley everything else is pantry/freezer items which is amazing. This dish is perfect. I do add 1/2ish cups of pasta water, as per other reviews. Get in mah belleh!

Just made this for supper and really liked it! I’m stuck in a blizzard and didn’t have all the ingredients. Ended up using rotini, no wine but used 1/2 cup of the pasta water. No shallots but will definitely get if I make ahead. I just dumped some seasonings and added some bacon bits I had on hand. So simple, easy and delicious!

Oh my gosh...this is delicious!! Perfect combination of flavors. FYI: I didn’t have a lemon or fresh parsley, so I went against what I’d normally do & used bottled lemon juice & dried parley & it’s still amazing! I highly recommend this as a go to, simple, quick, delicious recipe!! I’ll use it on a regular basis! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Great recipe. Most scampi’s are too fattening with excess butter. This is very dry so added pasta water as recommended by another review. I also swapped white wine for chicken broth and it turned out fabtastic. Would recommend angel hair (lighter pasta) or spaghetti squash to lighten as this can be a heavy dish.

This was very good.  The only change I made was using a pound and a half of shrimp and a wee bit of grated lemon rind with the parsley.  I will make this again.

A good recipe for my first attempt at shrimp scampi!!  I only changed what I had on hand = chicken stock instead of wine, bow tie pasta and thanks to another reviewer lemon pepper instead of lemon.  In fact, i almost skipped it because I didn't  have any lemon - the lemon pepper was a good sub.  Next time  I'd like to try it with asparagus and / or mushrooms!  But it was really good and very easy to make!

I have made this on Christmas Eve a few times, and it is always a hit! I substitute fresh linguine (bought at the grocery store), as it absorbs some of the flavors and adds a lot of class to the plate for a special occasion. Also, after I shell the fresh shrimp I take clean shells and put them in a small pot with a bit of the wine... maybe a half a cup...and lightly boil to extract the flavor from the shells into the liquid which I strain and add when I put the cooked pasta into the skillet with the shrimp.... I also put a tablespoon or less of baking soda and salt and pepper on the shrimp and let them sit a few minutes before sauteing..  And I concur with adding the lemon juice at the very end, use more parsley for color, and enjoy!

This was fantastic! We made this with angel hair. Things I would change is double the shrimp and garlic (I added granulated garlic to bump up the taste at the end, so I'm thinking that doubling the garlic would accomplish the same thing) and adding 2 tablespoons more of butter at the end. Topped it with shredded parmesan. Heaven! I will definitely make this again - soon!

This was a great clean and flavorful dish that tased even better the second day. I added mushrooms into mine before adding in the wine and extra butter and loved getting bites of mushroom throughout the dish. Will be including this in my go-to meals.

We really enjoyed this meal! I subbed onion for shallots and added some coarsly  chopped carrots with the onion and garlic, then added a handful of sliced mushrooms along with the shrimp and used  Wegman’s gluten free corn spaghetti. These are pretty minor changes in my book so I think the recipe is a 5 as written.

If I could do 4.5, I would.  As written, this is a tad dry.  Just add more wine and pasta water.  Excellent recipe.  My wife said it was now her favorite pasta recipe!  Thanks!

I found this recipe easy to make and quite tasty.  I would use larger shrimp next time (I had medium on hand).  My only complaint is that is very greasy, and that's without the last teaspoon of oil over the pasta.  I might even go so far as to cut the butter and oil in half for both steps.  Overall we liked and it and will give the recipe another try.

It is easy, fast an extremely good!  Even if you make the fettucini without the shrimp.  My family Loves it.  I have made it several times with the shrimp and a couple of times with the pasta alone!  YUM!!!!

Delicious! Only thing I did differently was use chives as garnish/no parsley. Cut pasta and shrimp in half for two but kept sauce the same. I like sauce!

Made this tonight, 10/22/17 and we loved it! I added a little extra wine, butter, and oil to keep it moist and also I used frozen, precooked shrimp and just heated them up in the sauce before serving.

Good recipe!  The only thing I adjusted as to add some breadcrumbs to the butter/oil mixture before I added the pasta.  It seemed a bit too watery.  The little bit if breadcrumbs changed the consistency just slightly and added some really yummy texture.  My family and I loved it!!!

This is my go to scampi recipe. So quick and easy. I always make a little more sauce by using pasta water as others have suggested. If I don't have shallots I use minced fresh onion. Fresh garlic, don't be shy with it, is a must. My family doesn't care for parsley so if I have green onions on hand I use the green part for a little color. The red pepper flakes add a nice kick and make a beautiful presentation. A little freshly grated, good quality Parmesan added before serving takes this dish over the top!

We loved the recipe and make it quite often. The only thing I've noticed is that when you reduce the servings, the recipe ingredients are adjusted but not the directions. So I have to remember to reduce the butter and olive oil.

Since I only cook for one, I used less pasta and less shrimp. However,  I still use all the rest of the ingredients except for the parsley. Minced fresh Basil (I grow my own) was my topper. Would definitely make this again and again and again!

I made this on the fly, and was very pleased with the results.  I didn't have shallots or linguine, so substituted sweet onions and rotini pasta.  And used an extra large pinch of pepper flakes ( we like it hot in our house) and added about 3 Tbsp. of freshly grated Parmesan cheese right before serving.

Great recipe! Towards the end pasta was looking a bit dry. (Adding nutritional yeast which most likely had an affect on the end result). Cutting back noodles and adding a bit more olive oil it solved the problem and turned out splendid :) .

I loved it! Super easy and super delicious!!! I used red onions instead of shallots and apple cider vinegar because I didn't have white wine . I also added a little of the pasta water to it . This is definitely going to become a  "go to" dish for me!!

Light but filling.  I did add 1 cup of wine and 1 cup of pasta water to keep it moist.  Also added a package of spinach to the pasta for some color and sweet red pepper.  Will keep this as one of my 'go to' recipes.

Green Onions instead of parsley add a nice flavor.

My kids Ioved this!  I marinated the shrimp in an olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, and basil sauce before cooking.  I made the recipe as indicated, though I added mushrooms and used sweet onion as I didn't have any shallots and increased the olive oil and butter for more sauce..  The kids had thirds!

I used chopped scallions in place of the shallots as that's what I had on hand. And instead of the fresh lemon,  which I didn't have on hand, I used 6 packets of True Lemon, which is unsweetened 100% natural. It's actually crystallized lemon. Other than that, I followed the recipe using a bit more olive oil than the recipe called for. Shrimp scampi is one of my favorite dishes. This dish turned out so well that I plan to make it again and again! It's such an easy meal. I recommend highly.

This was awesome! So easy to make! I did add about a 1/2 cup pasta water like most of the other people said. I also switched out the wine for chicken broth. Highly recommended!!!!

Excellent! Made it with fresh parsley, real lemon and fresh grated parmesan cheese! Doubled the sauce for one box of Angel hair pasta for the perfect moisture!

The first time I made this dish, I followed the recipe exactly. It was good but the taste of the wine was a little too strong for me and my husband. The next time I made it, I used half the amount of wine and we loved it. I cannot count the number of times my husband has requested this dish! 

Thank you for an amazingly easy and tasty dish.

I also added about 1/2 cup or so of the pasta water.  Used less olive oil than called for since it seemed to overwhelm the dish, as in greasy. Other wise we really like this recipient.

Now I'm in trouble!!   My husband loves Shrimp Scampi. I made this dish for him on the start of Fathers Day weekend- like late tonight.  He thought it was absolutely fantastic. Great praise from a self-proclaimed food critic!  Oh- changes in the recipe!  I added scallops and simmered them a little earlier than the shrimp. I elected not to use lemon juice- another preference of my husband in regard to seafood dishes. For sure this will be on the hit list.  I owe you one for this recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. I followed the exact recipe. The only thing I will do next time is save a little of the pasta water to add to the sauces before I add the shrimp and pasta at the end. Very easy and will definitely make again. My husband loved it!

I have made this twice and love it. As another reviewer suggested , I put the cup of boiling pasta water in the sauce. I think without doing that, it would be too dry for our tastes. I did serve with fresh grated Romano cheese.

I used 12 oz of pasta and that was perfect.  Also saved some pasta water and added about a cup.  I loved this.  Served with a salad and plenty of garlic bread.  Will definitely make again.

Cut the pasta in half for a better pasta/shrimp ratio.  I did add some of the pasta water and it helped. I didn't have any shallots and forgot to use salt/pepper, so the taste was pretty bland. A few shakes of garlic salt perked it up.

I only did half the pasta and was glad I did otherwise it would have been very dry.  But tasty.  Would add a little extra kick next time.

A simple shrimp pasta with plenty of flavor. I did reserve about a half of a cup of the pasta water to the dish so that it wouldn't dry out some. Served with baked zucchini fries. Great dinner!

Very good recipe. I added about 2 cups of grape tomatoes half's after sauting the shallots and garlic (doubled the shallots and tripled the garlic),  then added salt and pepper, and chopped green onions , and a cup of dry Martini, and simmered while preparing the shrimps. 
I added have the parsley and kept the other half to add before serving.  
After the mix reduced,  I added a cup of heavy cream and continued to simmer. I added the uncooked shrimps 2 minutes before the linguine was cooked. Then added the pasta, mixed everything and added the rest of the parsley and some chopped green onions. served with green salad.

it was amazing dish and very flavourful

Better than using  heavy cream for a shrimp Alfredo. Has to be eaten hot right away, or the butter and oil will solidify.

Substituted what I already had on hand...yellow onion, white cooking wine, and lemon juice along with other listed ingredients (except parsley...didn't have any). Also added spinach and one cup of pasta water as suggested by another reviewer. My family thoroughly enjoyed!

Made this following the recipe.  Found it to be rather tasteless and bland.  Needs a lot more garlic and Italian seasoning.
Will not make this one again, but will try a different recipe.

I'm not sure if I added too much pasta, or is meant to be this way, but there wasn't much sauce to this recipe. The flavor was great and the preparation was quite easy, but my boyfriend and I both agreed that this dish wasn't much our thing. Great flavor though! Next time, will definitely make a double batch of the sauce if I try this one again.

After all the wonderful reviews, I made this recipe just as directed. And I use fresh shrimp as well. It was not very good at all. Very , very bland. So instead of throwing it out, I added more garlic, some cream and and parmesan to make it palatable.

I don't eat seafood. So I'm basing it on my children's options, and they did not like it. They thought it bland. It was easy to make and the dish looked fabulous.

Will definitely make it again - we used an onion instead of shallots and we had some scallops left so we added those to our shrimp.  I'd like to try the shallots next time and I'll skip the scallops - it needs the density of more shrimp.  I found it a bit too lemony, so may cut back on that next time, but it could have been the wine we used, too.

Absolutely loved it! As I only had angel hair pasta, I measured a bit more and (luckily) it turned out to be really delicious. Used Chardonnay for the white wine and the flavor was perfect. I will be making this again!

I was not sure about the shallots, so I used one whole one which consited of two smaller ones.. Next time I will use two separate shallots and add a bit more pepper flakes, at least 1 teaspoon or more.

I reduced the amount of butter and oil a bit because it was a little heavy for my taste.  I also reduced the amount of shallots. Great flavor overall.  I'd add more salt next time.

Fabulous recipe! 
This delicious dish is ALWAYS a hit! My only tip is to double the shrimp. Always purchase the finest fresh wild -caught shrimp you can find!

This was delicious. It is super easy to make, comes together quickly and was a huge hit in my house. It is very light and tasty. I followed the recipe as is with the exception of fresh lemon juice.  I had some bottled lemon juice and it worked fine. I did follow some of the other reviewers and reserved some pasta water to add in at the end to add a bit of volume to the sauce. I used about 3/4 of a cup. I will be making this again for sure. It was also good with a few sprinkles of cajun seasoning on top!

This recipe was so tasty and easy and quick that I will make it again and again. The only thing I substituted was half a cup of chicken stock instead of white wine. It tasted great.

Omg this is good!! I used precooked shrimp I had on hand, and I had to use dried parsley which I soaked beforehand. Even so, it was delicious. The lemon flavor was delicate but really came through. Definitely will make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I'm happy because he's not generally a fan of shrimp dishes, but he liked this very much, so I will make again.  I cut the recipe in half and had two large servings.  I saved some pasta water, as others had suggested, but I did not need it, largely because I splashed in a bit more lemon juice and white wine, so it it was not dry.  This is a simple recipe that you can play around with.  Really good!

We followed the recipe and found it lacked just a bit of oomph. Still very enjoyable though as we love shrimp. Leftovers were tastier as the flavour soaked in. Might try to add some extra flavour next time. All in all, nice dish.

Great scampi recipe with the pasta water addition.  I made a tomato "chutney" (fresh chopped tomatoes, parsley, and feta cheese, mixed slightly together and added cold to the pasta when served) to top this and it was a definite "make this again" dish.

This was fabulous!  Made a big batch (1 1/2 lbs linguine and 2 pounds of fresh shrimp from my local seafood market)  Adding about 3/4 cup of the pasta water, half the butter and olive oil and zest from the lemon in the final step really made the sauce rich and not so oily.  I put lemon pepper on the shrimp and let it sit in the refrig while  I prepped the shallots, garlic and fresh parsley.  Using shallots is a must.  They add a beautiful nutty taste to the flavor profile that onions just don't possess.  Will certainly make it again.

This came out good! I used spinach fettuccine (2 boxes which equaled 16 oz.) also, I forgot all about using the parsley -_- I also added a red pepper and mushrooms. Hubby loved it though!!

This tasted great and was easy for even a non-cook like me to make. You can add a little more red pepper and garlic to give it a little more zip and some additional shrimp to meet the liking   of shrimp lovers.

I used fresh chives instead of the scallions because that is what I had.  The flavor was delicious.  I think I would add one more garlic clove in the future.

I made this exactly as directed and the flavors were light and delicious and just right.   Not too lemony either, which I was worried about, but you get a hint of it.    I thickened the sauce ever so slightly just so it wasn't watery.   It's nice to have a flavorful pasta dish without a heavy cream sauce.   I made the full pound of pasta (I used thin spaghetti) and found about 12 oz of it was a perfect pasta:sauce ratio.   Delicious!!

We actually just made this tonight, the day the recipe was emailed. We definitely will make it again, but since we don't normally have angel hair, we used rotini. It was fine. The juice of a lemon... we should have looked up how much that would be because we used quite a bit too much. Aside from our mistakes... very tasty and easy.

First time making a Seafood Pasta and it turned out pretty good but I would recommend adding a sauce like alfedo because its kind of dry with no sauce. Added Italion Seasoning and Basil to it too.

Great recipe! Made it for my family for Valentine's Day.. tweaked it a bit by adding lobster to shrimp seasoned as directed. I also added spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms and green onion. It came out beautifully with all the colors of the veggies. One note, the next time I would double sauce or try adding pasta liquid because it was a bit dry. Other than that,..wonderful and I will make this again.

Added 1/2 t. red pepper flakes, 3 cloves of pressed garlic, 1/2 c white wine, tsp parsley, tsp old bay, 1/2 lemon, blk pepper, salt. let this cook for 2 min and then added shrimp just till warm. Served over Whole Wheat Angel hair w/roasted carrots and asparagus. Sprinkled parmesan on shrimp just before serving. OMG SO GOOD.

This is so quick and easy.  I always keep some high quality jumbo shrimp, peel on, in the freezer.  Defrost the amount you want (never force defrost with running water... microwave, or overnight)  The lemon juice gives it great sparkle and the hint of heat is great.  Looks elegant on a large platter garnished with some extra lemon and parsley.

I made this the other night.  I thought it was very good but we lacked enough sauce.  I used a lemon pepper pasta that was a great addition.  We thought it tasted great but the next time I make it, I will increase the amount of sauce.  (Maybe it was the pasta i used - who knows - but yummy!) Glad I found the recipe.

This was a very good dish. I did add an extra half a cup of pasta water as one of the reviewers recommended. I think maybe next time I will add a full cup of pasta water because I do like a pasta that has sauce. I love to dip garlic bread in that sauce. It was so good I also threw in a handful of lobster meat I had left over from the holidays. Being from the East Coast we eat a lot of seafood and I can see this recipe working with scallops Lobster or shrimp. This is an excellent recipe that I plan on using again.

I made the recipe as is. Yes I will make it again but I will add a bit more garlic and top with fresh Parmesan cheese. My husband really liked it as is. I will also double the sauce part. I like more "juice" for the noodles.

A great dish! I did, however, tweak it quite a bit. The only ingredients I used were butter, garlic (4 cloves,) red pepper flakes, lemon juice (4 table spoons,) 2 tablespoons reserved pasta water, salt & pepper to taste, parsley, fresh Parmesan cheese and 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest. The husband doesn't love too much citrus so I really had to adjust that, obviously, but its a lovely dish, that's for sure.

I made this tonight and it was really good. I read another reviewer say she added pasta water which I meant to do but drained the pasta without remembering. It would have been a little better with the pasta water. I added more garlic and red pepper flakes because both my husband and I like garlic and really spicy. It was so easy. I will put this on a regular rotation. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this tonight for dinner, and my husband told me, "I don't care for this at all!"  I looked at him with a surprised expression, and he continued, "Wanna know why?"  Of course I did!  "Because it's TOO GOOD!  I WANTED TO EAT THE WHOLE PAN!  YOU CAN MAKE THIS ANYTIME!"  That's extremely high praise from my picky eater!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only thing I changed was instead of shallots, I used finely chopped sweet onion, because I couldn't find any shallots.  Outstanding!  I'll be making this for company next time we have folks over!

I've made this recipe per directions several times and it's one of my wife's favorites.  It's easy to throw together.  A few things I've changed that either did nothing to take away from the taste or enhanced it.  One, use a regular onion.  Shallots are pricey and I found no change in the taste using a regular yellow onion.  Two, add capers.  The capers added an additional flavor that enhanced and combined with the others. (You can offset the cost of the capers by using a regular onion)  This is a great recipe for beginning cooks...very easy.

I made this dish. Over all I would give it a 8 out of 10. Good flavors but could have used more liquid. Next time I will add about 1/2 cup of water or a little bit more wine, butter, and olive oil.

This was really good.  Simple, fresh, and all the ingredients really stood out.  One thing to be careful for - the salt and pepper added to the shrimp tend to stay on the shrimp, while the salt and pepper added to the sauce at the end will help coat the noodles.  I ended up with shrimp that were very salty and a sauce that wasn't salty enough.  I will know to be more careful next time.

Followed the recipe except I used old bay seasoning in place of salt. It was good, but a bit dry. I think I will make a double batch of sauce if I make this again. I used Holland House white cooking wine.

Made this for dinner last night. It was easy. I used a bag of frozen shrimp which was de-shelled and this made it easier. My son, age 13 had it for the first time and loved it. I'll definitely make it again. Next time I may add some other vegetables-artichokes, tomatoes and/or mushrooms.

I had such high hopes for this recipe but it was just bland. I think I'll try an extra clove of garlic or two next time. I did leave out the red pepper because my husband is very much against anything spicy. He says it need salt, but I'm not sure.

I made this leaving out the shallots and red pepper due to my picky eaters (children). I didn't reserve any of the pasta water but wish I did. It was definitely on the dry side although still very tasty. Next time I will add the water.

Outstanding! Making  use of what I had at hand,  I used jasmine rice instead of pasta, cilantro in place of the parsley, and onion in place of shallots. LOVED this dish! Thank you for sharing!

This was delicious, except when I tasted the sauce before tossing, the lemon was way too strong so had to redo the white wine with oil and butter. Then it was pretty good

Husband, 4 year and I devoured the whole pan! Used the "1 cup pasta water" at the end and simmered until it all soaked in! This was DELICIOUS!

I followed this recipe perfectly except I did add an extra clove of garlic because we adore garlic. This was fabulous!  I have already shared it with family and friends.

Delicious! My family loved it. I will definitely make this dish again. I didn't change a thing. But may have added a smidge more red pepper flakes than what was called for. We like spice.

Will definitely make this again.  I used whole wheat spaghetti and somehow left the parsley out, but it was great anyway! I do agree that it needs 1/2 to 1 cup of pasta water, and then cook it down a little.  Lots of flavor.

I had some leftover boiled shrimp so I used them in this recipe. I doubled the liquid and added a cup of the hot water from the pasta for a little more juice. It was very flavorful and quite easy to make!

Awesome recipe.   Didn't change too much...kept the shrimp warm in the oven at 250 and added extra parmesan to the noodles.  Sauteed the whole lemon with the wine and butter.  My husband said it was the best shrimp ever...should be served at a restaurant.  Awesome??

My family loved this!  My 2 year old is very hard to please when it comes to food and she asked for seconds.I added an extra 2 table spoons of butter to the sauce at the end because I read a few comments that stated  it was a little dry.  This worked great, not dry at all !!!

From a very critical reviewer...this recipe ROCKS! Do not change a thing. We used the "wild caught" frozen shrimp from Costco (10/15 count/lb). I recommend using the larger shrimp. This recipe is amazing!

The first time it was overpowered with the dry white wine. The second time I only used 2 tbl. spoons and wow what a difference! You can then add a little more if you like...

Made this tonight and we say it was delicious! I changed it somewhat. Chopped  yellow squash from our garden, and some broccoli, green onions, (didn't have scallions), lots of garlic which I cooked up, then added the shrimp with the lemon pepper, lime juice,  since I didn't have lemon and a cup of the water from the spaghetti. It came out very good. It was such a light meal and we will definitely be cooking it up again! I am thinking about trying it with chicken sometime. Thanks for the recipe.

Only made one change.  I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  Was serving over linguine, so wanted extra sauce.

Would definitely make again.

Very tasty!  I finessed it a smidge with some extra lemon zest, a tad more garlic, and a little fresh ginger (just brightens everything). We were thinking of adding some bacon (and grease) the next time I make it. YUMMY!

Not bad.  Very easy to make, but a little on the bland side for me.  Too much pasta, not enough sauce.  More sauce may help, but I think the sauce may still be a little bland for the dish.
