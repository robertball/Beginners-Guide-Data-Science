I was really surprised by how much I liked this quick bread! The changes I made were to use all-purpose flour, fresh mango that I pureed in the blender using 2 of the smaller and tastier yellow mangoes and I sprinkled organic cane sugar on top. I loved the crunchy topping and the texture of the inside of the bread - nice and moist. I noticed that in a couple of pieces there were small mango chunks and these pieces were particularly good leading me to believe that maybe the mango amount should be doubled with one ripe mango cut into small chunks. I would add even more fresh cranberries next time and maybe a bit less walnuts or even leave them out altogether.  Very nice bread that I would make again. The orange zest is also subtle but definitely adds flavor. Thanks for this recipe!!

8/23/06 Update: My first rating yesterday was 4 stars, but overnight the bread became delicious and flavorful and even more moist and tender. My Mom insisted I go back in & rate it 5 stars!  FIRST REVIEW 8-22-06: I didn't have cranberries but used raspberries with good results. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup & because I only had 3/4 cup mango puree, I increased the oil to 1/3 cup; decreased the baking powder by 1 teaspoon, and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla & a couple dashes cinnamon. EVEDDER is right--the mango is very subtle; it makes a moist loaf with a nice texture, not a whole lot of flavor though. Still a nice recipe that I will make again--thanks Sue.

Absolutely fantastic. The texture is great, a solid loaf without being heavy or dense. The taste is superb, with no one element overpowering the others. The mango taste is subtle, but delicious. Fairly easy to make. At 259 cals per smallish slice, it's not a dieter's friend, but makes a perfect special treat.   I followed the recipe to the letter except for substituting chopped cashews for the walnuts (you have to use what you got, right?)

Not very thrilling. I used 2 mangos as suggested and waited for flavours to blend the second day. Maybe mangos are one of the fruits that dont lend themselves to baked goods. I doubt that I will make this again...

Thanks for this recipe!  I've made it twice now.  The first time I left out the orange zest and it tasted very wheaty at first followed by the cranberry taste (I couldn't taste the mango).  I should note that this time I used older wheat flour.  The second time I used fresh flour with a bit of orange zest (about half of what it called for).  I also added about 1/3 c millet and I sprinkled a bit of turbinado sugar on top before baking.  This time it was a lot sweeter.  You could taste the orange first, then the cranberry.  The millet added a wonderful crunch.  Everyone like or loved this recipe. Also, FYI the amount of mango called for is about 1 whole mango.

Very delisiouso!  I used organic sugar.  Instead of using all whole wheat, I substituted about 1/2 cup flax meal.  I thawed frozen mangos and pureed in the food processor.  A quick way is to food process the mangos, then the cranberries, then the walnuts to get them ready.  I did not use 1 tsp. salt - that's way too much.  Cut it down to 1/2 tsp. salt.  I used Olive Oil instead of Canola.  The top comes out crunchy.  It's very good.  I also doubled it and made muffins.  I got two medium loafs, one large, and 12 medium muffins by doubling it.  I gave them away as gifts.  I brought this to church and everyone loved it.  Thanks!

Very moist and delicious.  Costco had sliced mango on sale - short expiration date - and I pureed in the food processor.  Also chopped the fresh cranberries in the processor, as well as the walnuts.  The bread has a tangy/sweet taste and makes a great breakfast treat.  Will definitely make again; thanks for the recipe!

I had a can of Mango puree that I wanted to use and when I found this recipe I new it would work. I tweeked the recipe by using macadamia nuts vs. walnuts and substituted 1 cup AP flour for 1 cup whole wheat flour. Turned out great. I call it Mango Cranberry Macadamia Nut bread. I'll be making it again this week for my coffee klatch peeps.

I did do a couple of switches though. I made a triple batch to take to a dinner so I needed a lot. But man I'm glad I made this! I used 2 1/2 cups organic cane sugar (instead of the tripled recipes 3 cups) I didn't have enough mango but lots of orange so I used 2 cups of orange puree and 1 cup no sugar apple sauce. I used 4 cups of chopped fresh cranberries. But no nuts at all because toddlers were going to being it and you never know about allergies. The first night it was good but kind of crumbly but the next day it was absolutely amazing! You can't hardly tell it is whole wheat and the orange was bursting through! Definitely will make again but the day before I serve.

I was a bit dissapointed with this bread. I could not taste the mango at all. It also didn't rise much and was VERY dense, so it didn't bake completely. But the flavor it had was good, it just didn't taste like mangos.

Didn't taste much like mango to me but it was really good regardless. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 or less cup as the mangos I used were very sweet. I only added 1 tsp orange zest and was glad as that seem to overpower the taste a little. I forgot to put the cranberries so I poked a few on top before baking and covered with dough so they wouldn't burn. I left out the walnuts.

I altered this recipe considerably to make it semi-healthy, and it turned out quite yummy. I used the same above ingredients & measurements with the following exceptions: I split the 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour with half (1 1/4 cup)whole wheat  and half all-purpose flour; I substituted the sugar, orange zest and mango with: two mashed bananas, a 1/8 cup splenda, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup orange juice; I also added 1/4 cup semi-sweet mini chocolate chips.

I did exactly as said
Not testy at all, maybe we need to add sour cream, like in Banana Bread and vanilla too because whole wheat flour doesn't smell well, even with orange

I tried to make this using the bread machine by using bread flour (2 1/2 cups), active yeast (2  teaspoons), and dried cranberries. Instead of orange zest I added 1/2 tablespoon of lemon and orange extract. It came out moist but overall I liked the flavor  with the hint of mango. I'm going to try and make it again and probably tweak what I already had changed.

Very tasty bread to make for Christmas! I followed recipes with the exception of using regular unbleached flour and a little bit of applesauce to make up a full cup of mango puree.  I live at 8600' so I decreased the baking powder to 2 1/4 tsp. and baked it in 3 small loaf pans rather than 1 larger one. I also greased the pans with butter which I believe was not suggested.

I agree with the prior rec's for 1/2 WWF rather than 100% -- the mango flavor is subtle even with half all-purpose. The cranberries added nice tartness. I decreased the sugar which helped amp up the fruit flavors.

I made this with pecans and all-purpose flour and it was great! Mine came out with just the right texture and moisture level. I love the tartness of the cranberries. I plan on making this again.
