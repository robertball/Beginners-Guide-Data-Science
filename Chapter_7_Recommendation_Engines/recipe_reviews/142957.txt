Great recipe; can't help but wonder why people prepare meals such as this and consequently criticize the fat and sodium content. If it's your desire to cut down on your fat and sodium intake, for the love......make something that's low in fat and sodium. Don't screw up someone else's recipe and then complain about it!

This is to die for. The only thing I did change was using roasted garlic and frozen peas instead of canned. I just placed the frozen peas in a little warm water until they thawed, then added them. Canned peas are a bit too mushy for my family. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe. It works every time!

I've tried this recipe with minor changes--I love roasted garlic, so I roasted a head (40 mins in an oven @ 425, covered in olive oil and in a foil pouch) and caramelized onion. It is to DIE for!

to lower the fat and sodiunm I would start by using turkey bacon instead of prosciutto, fat free half and half instead of heavy cream, frozen peas instead of canned and half the parmesean. I always substitute with lower fat versions and the family usually can't even tell the difference!

This is exactly like the carbonara recipe that I used to enjoy weekly at my first job at a local italian restaurant that sadly closed down a year or two ago. A quality bacon can also be subbed for the prosciutto without harming the flavor and if you prefer your sauce very thick an easy way is to add a couple teaspoons of flour (up to a tablespoon, however you need to leave at least an equal amount of oil/drippings in the pan) after you've sauteed the meat in the pan, stir it around and let it cook for a minute before slowly whisking in the cream. Wonderful comfort food! Thank you for posting!

I made this tonight for my husband and I and it was very delicious. I used diced prosciutto and added a bit of chopped garlic in with it. I also didn't have bow tie pasta so I used seashell and I think it works better than bow tie because the peas and diced prosciutto can fit inside, so yummy!

I had to make use of leftover prosicutto, but no heavy cream or bow ties.  I had a box of thin spaghetti and used a jar of store bought alfredo sauce with garlic and mozzarella inside that I had on hand instead.  I sauteed the prosciutto with slices of half an onion first until the onions were almost clear.  I had no peas, but used 1/2 a can of chopped asparagus.  Added the vegetable and the sauce and heated it through.  This is a REALLY good, quick, and versatile meal.  My boyfriend finished his whole plate.  Although next time I would use thinner sliced prosciutto (I had thickness #3 on hand from the deli).

Wonderful!  When I moved from AZ I missed this favorite dish at a local restaurant.  Now I can make it whenever I want.  I agree about substituting frozen peas for canned.  To duplicate the restaurant's version, I'm going to try artichoke hearts instead of peas.  So easy it's ridiculous!

This was so easy and delicious.  I added sauteed garlic and used milk instead of cream and it was great!!  Even my two year old said it was delicious. I cut the cheese to one cup and it still had plenty of flavor.  It took no time at all to whip up.

Great basic recipe you can play with. I had no cream and don't care much for peas, so I used jarred alfredo sauce and sauteed mushrooms and asparagus. Yum! I love prosciutto and this is a great recipe to use it in!

I agree with some of the other reviews: being Italian I can testify that we use cooked prosciutto extremely rarely because it becomes really salty and overpowers the otehr flavors. This recipe in Italy is usually made with diced ham (which does not come out so salty when cooked). In any case, I would refrain from cooking the ham ahead of the cream. They can just be cooked together. Cooked mushrooms can also be used/added to the sauce.

I also can't understand why people would change this so drastically, then rate it--especially when they substitute something else for the main ingredient!  I'm giving this four stars the way it is, buy mostly because of the canned peas with extra salt.  All you have to do is throw some frozen peas right in with the cream and they'll defrost in no time.  While this recipe is fine as written, if you feel like taking it up a notch, try adding roasted red peppers and basil (fresh is really great!).  This is one of my staples.

Oh, my gosh!  This is WONDERFUL!!  I made it for dinner tonight and I will certainly make it again!  I used half and half, along with 2 tablespoons of butter, and frozen peas.  Had to use ham instead of prosciutto, they don't carry that at our small local grocery! LOL!  Yum, yum, yum!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this last night it was very good, family raved about it and thats a miracle because my mother and father are very critical especially of my cooking. I followed the recipe with the exception of a few things. First I used mushrooms instead of peas because I do not like peas and to make the sauce a little thicker I added a half a stick of butter and 2 egg whites. I also browned the prosciutto a little longer too just to make it less chewy. It was very filling served with salad and Italian bread. This is one for the "Repeat Recipe" box!!!

way too salty, sauce too thin and prosciutto too overpowering and i only used 1/4 pound as opposed to the half pound it calls for.  i used broccoli instead of peas because peas are disgusting (IMO).  the broccoli was the only saving grace of this dish.  i think ill just stick to Alfredo when i want a white sauced pasta dish.

It tastes so delicious and I read someone's review on your to suggest to add a tbsp of flour that should be mix with little meat/olive oil.  Also, it needs to cut down procuitto to 1/4lb because I want to taste the sauce.  Other than that, it's so wonderful.

Awesome! This is a great and easy recipes. I did 2 things different. 
1. I read in a review that the sauce was a little runny. So, instead of draining grease from the prosciutto, I added a little flour and then added it to the sauce. 
2. Then I also, added sliced grilled chicken to the top after tossing the sauce and pasta.
I will be making this again! Maybe next time add a little gorgonzola! Yummy!!

I thought this recipe was alright.  It tasted salty (I did not add any salt) and it was too high in fat.  It was quick and easy but it made a lot of dirty dishes.  I don't think I'll make this again.

Definitely a five-star recipe!  I agree with Mary Sheridan, it's unfair that someone substitutes ingredients then gives the recipe a mediochre review.  As it is written it is wonderful. I'm going to try it with asparagus one time and broccoli another.  But, if I didn't like it with asparagus I wouldn't blame the person who submitted the recipe.

This was extremely yummy! We loved it! And so easy to make. I didn't use whole cream, I used light half and half, and it was still very yummy! :)

I went ahead with the 1/4 lb of diced procuitto, but used fat free half and half and a smidge of flour for the sauce.  Let me just add here that NO canned peas have been in my household in over 40 yrs, nor will they ever darken my door.  I used frozen peas.

This dish was much too salty for my entire family, and I love salt.  I think if the amount of prosciutto was decreased, it would make a big difference.

Really good! I ran out of Parmesan so I substituted Gouda for about 1/3 of the cheese. Came out nice and creamy though (I used a little more cheese then was recommended though)

This was excellent. I was looking to copy a recipe from my favorite restaurant. and this hit the mark. Surprised there was no butter and it wasn't needed. Following other reviews I added no salt and used frozen peas. I also added the flour to my prosciutto to thicken sauce just a bit and it came out just perfect. Another bonus--the sauce held up when reheating leftovers. So often a white sauce breaks down when reheating. Loved it, so did my husband. This went right into the recipe box!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I agree with the other reviewers, use frozen peas. ALso, I didn't add salt because the prosciutto is salty enough. I added mushrooms and finished it off with crushed red peppers. Everyone loved it. I will be making it again..

This is the sauce I have been looking for!! I order this dish every time I am at my favorite Italian restuarant.  The only ingredient missing is sun dried tomatoes... promise, it is the best addition!!

Worthy of 5 stars...I used asparagus instead of peas and used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of fat free half and half to cut down on the fat just a wee bit.  My 9 year old helped and loved it! Thank you for sharing!

I'd give this a 5-star but I read the reviews prior to making it and because of the changes that were better, it's why it's a 4.. I used it on linquini instead of bowtie to start. Used frozen peas because I'm not a canned anything veggie person, not to mention canned has additional salt. 3/4 cup is way too many peas for me as I now know. Also, I took everyone's suggestion and cut back on the proscuitto thinking it would be too salty and I wish I had put more in. I also added a bit of carmelized onion and some sun dried tomatos along with some fresh basil. All in all it was easy and tasted great. Definitely not for the calorie counters, that's for sure. I will definitely make this again..and again..next try is asparagus instead of peas :-)

I used a milk/cottage cheese mixture in place of the heavy cream to reduce the fat and calories and it still turned out great.

Soooo good!!!!!  I used angel hair instead of bow tie pasta.  Still delicious.  I would us a little less prosciutto, personally, as it is a very strong food.

This was a really easy and tasty recipe.  I also added a few "extra" seasonings.  I used frozen peas instead of canned...seemed just fine to me (and the rest of the family).

I thought the prosciutto was a little over powering in the sause, but other than that it was fantastic!  I followed the advice of a few other members and roasted garlic as my boyfriend and I are garlic-aholics and added that into the sause as well.  Next time I will lessen the amount of prosciutto to suit our tastes.

The overall taste of the recipe was pretty good.  I did substitute frozen peas for the canned; however, my sauce came out very thin, not like a typical alfredo sauce, despite my continuing to add more cheese.  I would have liked it to have been a little thicker to really stick to the pasta.  Good for a try, but not likely I would make it again.

My roommates and I really enjoy this recipe.  We made one change:  we're not fans of peas, so we substituted for asparagus.  i cut the asparagus into bite-sized pieces and sautee them for a short while.  It's very delicious!

This recipe has a good thing going with it, but needs some small changes.  First, I think the sauce needed less cream, and needs to have a little butter added (like, a quarter cup).  Then, the sauce needs to be thickened up a bit (mine came out runny and would not thicken like my other alfredo type recipes).  And I'm considering making this again, but plating it like this:  First, put the pasta on a dinner plate, then pour some of sauce on it, then sprinkle the prosciutto, and then sprinkle the cheese on top.  This way you can more or less control salt. 

Oh, and one more thing... this didn't keep well in the fridge over night (like most alfredo recipes).  So if you make this, I recommend not keeping any left overs.  I'll review this recipe again next time I make it.

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! Creamy sauce with bites of salty prosciutto.  I added shrimp to the sauce for a robust pasta meal.  It was delicious!  I will be making this one over and over.

Easy and tummy! I used Aldi prosciutto and it didn't have much flavor. I might go with a better brand or switch to a bacon for better flavor.  Otherwise easy and yummy!!!!  Great for lunch leftovers!

We all have our own dietary needs/restrictions; I eat low carb high fat so I was able to alter this to fit my needs subbing zucchini zoodles for the pasta and it was fantastic! The more cream, the better for me!

This is definitely a go to quick dinner choice! I've made some changes per suggestions. I've replaced prosciutto with bacon, added sliced green pepper, also added grilled chicken breast strips and season to taste. My seasoning includes garlic powder, salt, parsley and black pepper. This is not a diet recipe or watching your calories!! It is hearty, full of flavor and a total comfort food. Enjoy!

this is so good AS IS with one exception:  I used frozen peas and I used low fat half-n-half because that's what I use for coffee.  To the lady that said to use turkey bacon--NO!  the whole point of the recipe is the prosciutto.  Basically, this is a once-in-a-while dish so have a good breakfast, a light lunch and splurge for supper.  served with a nice salad and it was delish.  If I was interested in making this light I'd look in the low calorie section.  PEOPLE please stop making over the recipes and then rating your own %^#&^%* recipe.  If you people to try YOUR recipe submit; otherwise, rate and review.

This recipe has way too many calories and sodium content to even consider.  Any suggestions for making it more healthy?
