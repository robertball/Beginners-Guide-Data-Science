These cupcakes were some of the best that I have ever made. I think I found a solution for the reviewers who didnt have enough cake batter and or too much filling left over. I only filled the liners about 1/4 for the bottom layer. I used alittle over a tablespoon of the filling. For the top layer, I only filled the liners to 2/3 full. I got 24 cupcakes, and had no batter or filling left. the amounts were perfect, for me anyways. Mine came out perfectly moist and sooooo delicious to say the least!Another thing was that I only left mine in the oven for 18 minutes , exactly so mine werent burnt on the bottom. I had no problems with the filling sinking to the bottom and that is probably due to how long I whipped it with the mixer. Very light and fluffy. I used a Devil's Food cake mix and a Chocolate Fudge frosting. 
If I could I would give these a 10 star rating.
Thanks for the great recipe Star!!

These cupcakes were very good.  I made the cupcakes with a box of devil's food cake but I think that for next time I will use a box of dark chocolate mix.  (it would bring out the flavor of the filling more)  I definitely recommend using more than just a teaspoon of the cream cheese filling.  Use more like 2 TABLESPOONS of it and less cupcake batter.

These taste great especially using mini chocolate chips in the the filling and topping with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this website by JJ!  This recipe makes more like 2 dozen.  Make sure you do not OVERFILL the cup cake holder.  Only fill 1/4 of the way before adding the batter and then top fill to 1/2 - 3/4 filled.

Stop the cupcake recipe search, this is by far the best cupcake I have ever baked.  The texture is so moist, I only frosted half the batch!  I may experiment with white cake mix, strawberry cream cheese, and white chocolate chips next time.  Absolutely yummy!!

This is amazing.  I did use mini chips like many others suggested.  I have found that if you just spoon the filling on the top, it doesn't usually fall to the bottom.  When I made the cupcakes it made 24 regular and 18-24 mini.  Normal box mixes make 24 but I fugured that with adding the filling, the rest of the mix had to go somewhere.  I get more compliments on this then anything I make.  I will definately try other's ideas on alterations!

Wow. I hardley ever make cupcakes b/c they turn out dry. NOT the case with these sinful treats!! I made them for my Father-in-law's 60th b-day, and they were a huge hit! I followed the directions accordingly to measurements. I did however make the task simpler. I poured the cake batter into a ziplock and piped small amounts into the cupcake papers, so I would not overdo it, before I could get the cream chz in there. I also put the cream chz in a ziplock and did the same. Topped them off with another squirt of cake batter and popped them in the oven. To keep them from burning, Take them out when they still seem a bit jiggly. The cream chz needs time to cool, to set up. These again were awesome. And even better when they have had a few hours to cool off. I topped mine with pecan and almond frosting. Thanks for a great recipe.

These were sooo good! I too used mini chocolate chips but I added some toffee bits as well. I filled about halfway full w/ cake mix, added a small tbp. of filling & then topped w/ just a bit more cake mixture. It didn't completely cover the flling but it spread while cooking & did. The filling did settle more towards the bottom but I didn't get the pit in mine that some reviewers had problems with. I did use the Betty Crocker butter recipe mix & thought they tasted great. I sprayed my muffin papers to aid in removal but not sure it was necessary. I got about 20 cupcakes & still had a little filling left over so I followed the example of other reviewers & poured it into mini-muffin tins & baked them at 300 degrees for about 30 minutes. I was transporting the cupcakes out of town so I did not frost them...I just sprinkled them w/ powdered sugar.  Thanks for a wonderful treat...everyone enjoyed them!

These cupcakes got rave reviews!  I used chocolate cake mix with white chocolate chips (instead of semi-sweet).  I was still getting compliments days later.  I will definitely make these again and play around with different flavors.

These are the best cupcakes ever! I made them for my kids' birthday party and everyone loved them. I made a few changes: substituted Neufchatel for the cream cheese, and made the filling with Splenda instead of sugar. I also used mini-chips, since the first time I made these, the filling sank to the bottom. The mini-chips work better. I used all the filling except a Tablespoon or so, and had about 3/4 cup of cake batter leftover. I will do it this way next time, it's better if you use lots of filling (like half batter, half filling almost), then just drizzle a little more batter over the top. This makes 24 cupcakes, not 12.

These were very easy and tasty. I used devils food cake mix because that's what I had. I dyed the cream cheese orange for halloween and frosted with french buttercream frosting (also dyed orange) from this site. Awesome and well received.

We have used a similar recipe for these in my house for years.  My mother came across these when I was a teenager and they soon became my signature dish.  The only differences my recipe has are that we only use 1/3 cup sugar and a dah of salt is added to the filling. For the cake mix itself we only fill the muffin cups half full and drop about a 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of filling on the center. Then we bake them I've never found that I needed the extra batter on top the filling sinks to the middle just fine without it. Also I've never iced them before I always thought that would make them too sweet.

Creative and fun! I eliminated the chocolate chips, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and tinted the cream cheese batter orange for Halloween cupcakes. For the cake batter I used coffee rather than water and added one teaspoon each of vanilla and chocolate extracts. I used a gallon Ziploc bag to pipe the cake batter, and a quart-sized bag for the cream cheese batter. Sure made the process a lot quicker and neater! I frosted them with the frosting from "Cake with Buttercream Decorating Frosting," also from this site. I sprinkled the cupcakes with Halloween sprinkles and perched a Jack-o-Lantern Peep on each. Delightful with its ribbon of orange tinted cream cheese filling  and, oh yeah, creamy, chocolatey delicious too!

very good, moist recipe.  Fill most of the way with the batter before putting the filling and then just barely cover with more batter.  it will wind up in the middle.

This was so good... Instead of making cupcakes I made a 9x13 cake and put half of the batter in then spread the cream cheese filling and topped with the rest of the batter. I used cream cheese frosting from the AR site and it was delish. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Love love love! I made these for my daughter's 1st birthday and they were devoured.  Whipping the *very* soft cream cheese was key in keeping the filling light preventing it from sinking to the bottom as some previous reviews complained about.  Per previous suggestions, I also used the mini-chocolate chips and "layered" the batter and filling: 1/4 of the way up with batter, 1+ tablespoon of filling and then filling the remainder with batter to 2/3 full. For both the batter and filling I put them in ziplock bags using them as makeshift pastry bags which made it VERY easy to portion everything out. I used Tom's recipe for "Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting" to top. It was perfectly light and rich complimenting these DELICIOUS cupcakes. Thanks for the recipe Star!

My friends are always asking to make these cupcakes. I use all of the batter and filling to make 24 cupcakes.   Here is what I do: 1. Put ~1.5 TBL cake batter on the bottom of each cupcake. 2. Using a small spoon spread the cupcake batter up the sides of the mold 3. Fill each cupcake with filling. 4. Top with remaining cupcake batter. * This ensures that the filling is completely surrounded by batter. If you don't do this you will get a layer of filling which will cause the cupcake to split in half when you unwrap it.  Also like most chocolate cakes I think the cupcakes taste better after they've cooled and sat in the fridge for a while. I always frost 'em with some store bought frosting, usually Pillsbury Confetti. Also I use a small ice cream scoop for the cake mix- makes life easier!

A really simple and delicious way to spruce up from-the-box-cake cupcakes.  Not overly sweet, which is what I was going for.  Next time I will leave out the chocolate chips as a personal preference.

As other suggested, I used 1 tbls. of the cream cheese filling rather than just one tsp.  I found that the cream cheese filling migrated to the bottom of the cupcake.  The cupcake pretty much fell apart at the seam of cream cheese filling when they were first baked.  I stored some of the cupcakes in the refrigerator and found that after a day in the cold, the cupcakes held together much better.   I frosted the 24 cupcakes with the Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting from this site.  The frosting was wonderful -- I heaped it -- can't have too much frosting!  I originally had given a lower rating, but received so many compliments that I upped it to 4 stars.

I loved this recipe.  The only problem was the proportion of cream cheese filling. I made the first batch with the recommended 1 tsp. This made for a yummy cupcake but with very little filling, simply a white chipped streak through the bottom... I filled about 1/5 of the cup with batter, then 1 TBSP of cream cheese, then just enough batter to cover the cream cheese. This way it turned out amazing!!!

These cupcakes are incredible! I make them with Duncan Hines Red Velvet cake mix, then chop up white chocolate chips in place of semi-sweet. They are decadent with cream cheese frosting! For valentine's day fun I colored the filling and frosting pink, so cute! There are a few tricks to making them though: put the cake mix in a gallon ziploc bag and cut the corner for easy and mess-free filling, do the same with the cream cheese mixture. Only put a thin layer of mix, then the filling in the center but not going to the edges, and cover with the rest of the cake mix. I make these all the time and practice makes perfect. Enjoy!!

I used 2 cake mixes and made 1 filling recipe, worked out great as it made 48 cupcakes. 
I didn't put batter on top of the cheese, I added a scant teaspoon of raspberry jam, and I left out the chips, frosted with vanilla buttercream. 
These were really tasty, even my son who usually only eats the icing ate the whole thing!

These cupcakes were delicious!  They were very easy to make and everyone at my son's birthday party loved them!  Will definitely make again.  I just plopped the cream cheese filling on top, instead of covering it with a second layer of cake batter, and they turned out fine.  I would also say that the recipe yield is 24 cupcakes instead of twelve.  Great recipe!

This was a good recipe, if you don't want plain chocolate cupcakes.  I had too much filling left over, so I baked it in individual cupcake papers and that came out delicious too.

These were really good! Dont fill the bottom 2/3. Do about a tablespoon choc batter, 2 teaspoons of the creme cheese and then top with chocolate. So good!

Came out fine for me.  Ppl seemed to like it.  It just wasn't as gooey in the center as I hoped for.

I made these exactly as the recipe indicates except for using white mini chocolate chips.  Next time, I think I'll leave the chips out all together.  The cupcakes are so moist and flavorful that they don't need anything additional.  I whipped the batter on high for total of 3 minutes and whipped the cream cheese mixture too.  I think they may have helped with consistency, as I had no problem with them blending or the cream cheese sinking.

These are pretty good but I was a little disappointed with the filling. I added a full tablespoon to the center of each and it still was not really noticible when you ate them. I would make them again but add way more of the filling than what is called for in the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I made these cupcakes for a bunch of teenage girls and they loved them.  One girl even asked if I could email her mom the recipe!  Very delicious cupcakes!  I frosted with chocolate frosting, hiding the surprise and making them even more chocolaty.  I also used mini chocolate chips.  DIVINE!!  Does anyone know if they need to be refrigerated, since there's cream cheese in them?

I made it for my team at work and they loved it!!  My filling did not sink to the bottom, I think it's all about how you mix the ingredients so that the consistency comes out right.  I filled half the cupcake with mix, then put in a table spoon full of filling and topped with a tablespoon of cake mix.  Came out perfect! Delicious!

I made this recipe after a craving. I added more of the cream cheese mixture and didn't put any of the cake mix on the top. I also used a muffin tin and they came out the best. Will definatley make this again.

I made these for my daughters easter party at school--I made a batch with yellow cake and a batch with chocolate cake--they were both outstanding--even the teacher said they were the best cupcake she ever ate and she admitted to have eaten quite a few in her time LOL!--the only change I made was to  use mini chips and they came out great!

I used a strawberry mix instead of chocolate.  I also used white chocolate chips in place of chocolate chips.  It made 30 cupcakes.  For the frosting, I added a couple of teaspoons of strawberry jello and a tablespoon of milk to some white buttercream I already had.  My family said they were the best cupcakes they had ever eaten.

I made these Thanksgiving Eve to take for Thanksgiving dessert, and had to try one before I took them.  I'm sorry I did, because now I want to keep them all home!!  I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I didn't add the chocolate chips to the cream mixture.  I didn't think I would like the crunch.  I will make these again for sure.  Thanks so much for the post Star!

Unbelievably easy and rich!! No need to go w/a recipe that calls for making these from scratch - the boxed cake mix works great. The top dips in a little upon cooking (no big deal.) I am surprised to hear myself say that I recommend using cream cheese frosting instead of chocolate, b/c otherwise it's really TOO much chocolate (something I NEVER thought I'd say...)

I made this tonight for my son's classroom. I used boxed chocolate fudge cake mix and cream cheese frosting and decorated it with chocolate kisses & chips. Instead of filling it 2/3 way with cake batter, I did it 1/2 way. Just had enough of the filling and cake batter to do 24 standard size cupcakes. These were delicious! I ended up making 48 of them since the first batch was overcooked-my fault. But my nephew ate 5 of them unfrosted from the first batch and he said they tasted good either way.

These were so easy to make and yummy! My only hesitation for giving it 5 stars is the way they look when they come out.  Icing fixes everything, though.

the cupcake was very moist and just sweet enough to satisfy my taste buds.  i added a couple drops of vanille extract, half of semisweet and half of white chocolate chips to the cream cheese filling.  in total i made 39 filled cupcakes.  i just went ahead and topped it with normal vanilla cake icing and an m&m for color.  :)

These are great!  There realy wasn't much "filling" in them, but I think I was a little conservative w/dropping it in, fearing it would sink to the bottom.  Mine def didn't sink to the bottom, but I did have a hard time keeping it in the middle of the cupcake.  I added some almond extract to my choc cake mix and sliced almonds to my filling, along w/the choc chips.  You can easily half the amount of filling you make (even if I'd used a whole tbsp per cupcake-24-there'd still be a ton left).  Thanks for the recipe; I'm going to keep trying it and vary the flavor combos!

The only change I would make....add only 1/3 of the cake mix to the cupcake tins, then the cream chese mixture, then top with more cake mix.  2/3's mix did not leave enough room left in the pan to top the cream cheese mixture.

These cupcakes were 'okay'.  Not much better than just plain old ones made from a mix.  The creamcheese mixture sank right to the bottom, even though I used mini chipits like others suggested. Also, I had WAY too much filling left over and baked it in small muffin tins.  I think if I tried them again, I would only fill 1/2 with cake mix and then use a couple of tbsps of filling (not one tsp!).  Then just put a bit of cake mix over the top.

WOW!  These were the best cupcakes I've ever made.  The cream cheese center was to die for.  The cake mix makes more than just a dozen cupcakes - I think I got at LEAST two dozen out of it.  I had to make more filling, though.  Also, I followed someone's advice of filling the cups 2/3 full before putting in the filling and it turned out perfect - no burnt bottoms!  Thanks, my family loved these!

Yummy!! I used a devil's food cake mix and combined the cream cheese with powdered sugar instead of white sugar. I also added about 1 teaspoon of almond extract to the cake batter and then instead of chocolate chips, I used finely chopped almonds. I can't wait to try some of the many variations suggested by other reviewers!!

Awesome cupcakes. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting and got lots of compliments. I used the Pampered Chef small and medium scoops to fill the cupcake liners. First, I put a medium scoop full (equals 2 Tbsp.) of batter then a small scoop full (equals 1 Tbsp.) of filling then a medium scoop full of batter again. I got 25 cupcakes. They are yummy!

The bottom of the cupcakes came out dry, there wasn't enough cake batter to top 1/3 of the cakes, and I had a ton of filling left over. I baked the extra filling in cupcake liners, came out fine as little cheesecakes. 

Next time, I'll only fill the liners 1/2 full or less with cake batter (as opposed to the recommended 2/3 full), then add a heaping dollop of the filling (instead of just 1 tsp).

I made these cupcakes for a friend's birthday and brought the leftovers to work.  Everyone raved about them.  One person even told me that this was one of the best cupcakes he ever had.  On top of being delicious, the recipe was very easy to make.  The recipe made 24 cupcakes for me.  Instead of using 1 tsp. of filling, I used a spoonful since I read in other reviews that they had a lot of filling left over.  Even though I used more filling than recommended I had a lot filling left over.  I think next time I will only make half of the filling.  Also, the recipe says to fill the cups 2/3 the way full with the cake batter, then add the filling and then more batter.  I am sure people know this, but so they would not overflow I filled the cups 1/2 with batter, then added a spoonful of filling, and then topped it off with a little more batter.

YUMMY!  We just loved these.  IT didmake more then a dozen, 18 for me.  I love the way they looked when they came out of the oven.  I used a little less than 1 cup of chocolate chips because that is all I had in the cupboard.  They were moist and delicous.  Recommend this to all!!!

These cupcakes are FABULOUS! They were very moist and chocolatey.  I did not frost them, and they were perfect.  I also had a bit of filling left over and simply baked it alone in muffin cups. Those turned out delish also!

I had enough mix to make 2 dozen muffins. I will definately be making these again!

I was very pleased with this recipe.  It's perfect when you want something quick but a step above a cake mix alone.
Update: I tried an experiment and it worked: added a strawberry slice on top of each teaspoon of filling before covering with the remainder of cake batter.  Delicious!

These cupcakes were really good.  I did use about a tablespoon of the filling and still had a little leftover.  When I make them again I will not add the chocolate chips.  They stayed a little too hard and I did not think they added anything special to the cupcake.

Totally loved this recipe! The final texture of the product was amazing! I made a few changes though: (1)Instead of cake mix, I made the cupcakes from scratch using a recipe I found in this website (CREAMY CHOCOLATE CUPCAKES). I added 1 regular tbsp of batter+ 1 tbsp of filling + 1tbsp and 1tsp of batter. Baked for 20min, and they where perfect..28 perfect cupckaes. I frosted them with another recipe from this website (Basic Cream Cheese frosting). They are delicious! :)

Truly delicious. After reading other reviews, I used a 2 cookie dough scoops for the bottom, 1.5 scoops of the filling, and another scant scoop to top them off. I baked 18 minutes, rotating pans half-way through. 

The result was 24 moist, yummy cupcakes. However, my filling did sink and was more of a bottom layer than a filling. I think chilling the cream cheese mixture till firm, then rewhipping it would have been better. Mine was a little soupy. Mini-chips might also be a better substitute. Nevertheless, my fiancé is eating them like a starving man.

I really expected these to have a slight cheese cake taste but they didn't. My husband thought the cake was boring tasting and didn't even notice the filling (aside from the fact that it was white). Over all I don't really think it was worth the extra work to make the filling.

I made these w/ yellow cake mix since that was what I had.  I added the cream cheese and mixed in some cocoa instead of chips. I think next time I would add some vanilla chips or maybe butterscotch to a few to see how they do.  Mine mixed up more like a mousse.  I will try next time w/ red velvet.  I have ate the ones made just like the recipe before and they are wonderful.

These are soooo yummy! I used devils food cake mix and mini chocolate chips. Will be making these often. Exactly the perfect amount of each mixture to make 24 cupcakes.

These are delicious.  Per others, I added a heaping tablespoon (regular food spoon, not a measuring Tbsp.) of the cream cheese filling and there was just enough for 24 cupcakes.  I was worried because it seemed like they were too full (only 1/4 in. from the top of the cup) when I put them in the oven, but they came out with a nice loft and were perfect!  No frosting needed either!

I've made these cupcakes several times now and have found the only way for me to get the filling in the center is to use a pipping bag. When I tried to follow the directions I ended up with the filling being swirled in on the top of the cupcake. Now I fill the liners with the cake mix and use a pipping bag to get the cream cheese into the center. Works great and the these cupcakes are soooo good it is worth the extra effort!

Absolutely amazing! Super fast and easy and an absolute knock out! These were a huge hit at my office, all my coworkers claimed I'd ruined their diets because they couldn't stop at just one. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully.

I made these just like the recipe said here and they where great.  I have made them again but this time a changed things around: I used a Golden Cake Mix,the same cream cheese filling but I used a can of Pumpkin Pie Filing and sprinkled a few slivered almonds on top. They are just a great as the original recipe.

I made these for my husband's birthday and used a triple chocolate fudge cake mix.  I also used a little bit of strawberry cream cheese to supplement the regular cream cheese.  They were easy and definitely good, especially with chocolate frosting!

I love this recipe!  I have made these multiple times and they always come out light and delicious.  I follow the ingredients exactly, except using the mini chocolate chips instead of regular sized ones.  When filing the cups, only fill 1/4 of the way, use 1 tbsp of filling, and then cover filling just barely with more cake batter.  If you do this you'll get about 30 cupcakes.  I have over-filled them before and then they aren't as pretty.  Thanks for the great recipe that both adults and kids love!

Absolutely delicious. Made 20 cupcakes instead of twelve. (Not a bad thing!) I replaced the oil for the cake batter with applesauce, which makes the cupcakes healthier AND keeps them moist. I will definitely be making these again.

LOVE LOVE LOVE these cupcakes!    I used a devil's food cake mix (least expensive on the shelf).  After reading the reviews of other's, I did make a few adjustments.  I ADDED 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract to the cream cheese filling.  >>>I didn't add the chocolate chips to the cream cheese filling. I ended up using about 1/2 C of semi-sweet choc. morsels. Not too sweet.

People say these are the best cupcakes they've ever had!  That being said,    The next time, I would do as another reviewer said and fill the cups 1/4 full then add 1 Tbs of filling then top with  small amount of batter.  So that the cups are 2/3 full. I followed the recipe exactly and I had filling left over and the filling is so good, the cupcakes would have been even better with more than the tsp. Also the cupcakes spilled over some. Still these were awesome.

I've been making these for quite some time now. This is the perfect go-to recipe when you don't have a lot of time to bake from scratch, but want something that feels homemade. Everyone who eats these completely dies over them (for real! EVERY single person!) The cream cheese filling really gives it a special touch and you know how much people like cream cheese.. can't go wrong! Like other users, I use mini chocolate chips and top with either a chocolate frosting or cream cheese frosting. Thanks!

These were so good. I followed the reicpe  except I only put a little bit of batter on the bottom, a lot more filling in the middle and just enough batter on top to cover it. They smelled like oreos when the were baking in the oven, the house smelled so good. I also drizzled a little chocolate on top after they cooled to make them pretty. Thanks for the really easy recipe!

I made these for our small group at church and everyone loved them.  Every single cupcake was eaten and I had several requests for the recipe.  Made them again for a baby shower but used white cake mix, strawberry cream cheese, and white choc. chips.  They were a hit as well.   Just barely cover the bottom with batter, then do 1 1/2 TBS of cream cheese and top with batter.  This makes 24 perfectly sized cupcakes!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

OMG...this is the BEST recipe for cupcakes!  Why would you spend $4.00 a cupcake at a fancy bakery when you can make these yourself??    I followed other suggestions and filled the muffin cup with 1/4 batter, generous portion of cheesecake filling, and covered the filling with more cake batter.  When they were cool, I iced them with Hard Chocolate Glaze (recipe on the site).  The finished product looked like a Hostess Cupcake minus the white squiggle.  Enjoy!

I made these using a mini-muffin pan. I used a dark chocolate cake mix (extra moist). I used less oil then called for, I added a bit of vanilla. I used this recipe for frosting: 3oz. cream cheese, 2Tbl. butter, 2C. powdered sugar, 1/2tsp. vanilla. I put the frosting in a decorating tube, and put one dollop of frosting in the middle of each cupcake. Thanks fro sharing this recipe :)

this was a great addition to my chocolate cupcakes.I was bored with the usual cupcake.. chocolate with icing on top,so i went searching for something different and came across this wonderful recipe. I made them last nite for a family dinner and everyone raved about them.There are many kids in the family and well the were my critics and I was worried about the cheese filling turning them off, but I got the opposite. The kids thought they were awesome.They all came up to me and asked me what i put inside them.
I did what others said and used mini chocolate chips and that was a great tip. I use a my own recipe for the cupcakes and just added the filling. I also use cream cheese frosting II for icing on top .I didn't have a problem with the filling sinking to the bottom. over all i luved this recipe.I call it a SURPRISE CUPCAKE. Im known as the cupcake queen now, and everyone wants me to make more for the next dinner party which is soon. Thank you for this recipe , i will keep it.

Very very good!  I didn't have a full 8oz pkg of cream cheese, so I a few tablespoons of peanut butter to the filling.  Oh my goodness was it ever good!  No frosting needed...just sprinkled with powdered sugar.  What a great recipe.

These cupcakes are soooo yummy and versatile.  I have tried this so many different ways, and they are always good.  Try them with red velvet cake mix and choc chips or choc cake mix with mint choc chips.  These are so good they don't even need frosting.

I have made these cupcakes a few times and they always come out great. However, I do not even add the chocolate chips as they take away from the cheesecake flavor. And I never worry about the mixture sinking to the bottom because it makes a nice swirl effect and looks like marble cake. It's an easy twist for those of us who like to bake out of a box. I read a few reviews that said it wasn't worth the effort and that is just crazy, I don't even like chocolate cake and I LOVE this recipe!

These were soooo good, and chocolatey enough to satisfy even the worst chocolate craving!  I used mini chocolate chips instead of regular ones and the cupcakes came out great. I also got 18 huge cupcakes out of this recipe instead of the 12 called for in the serving amount listed.  There is no need for frosting--these treasures are good enough to eat unfrosted!  These will definitely be made again!

Loved the filling, but putting just a round teaspoon in the cupcakes wasn't enough, it only made them moist and I had plenty leftover.  Next time I will use more.  I also used this in a vanilla cake mix- Delicious.

Super easy and such a treat!  I followed the recipe exactly and then I topped some with cream cheese frosting and some with chocolate, both were great.

UPDATE:  I have made these several times, and I still love them!  Just as an added treat, I mix mini-chocolate chips in the filling, yum.

So good.  Filled 1/2 full, added 1 TBS of cream cheese mixture (using whipped cream cheese) and then filled up to a little less than 3/4.  Underbaked slightly and were absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe.

These cupcakes are so good! I used Pillsbury Dark Chocolate cake mix, added 1/8 tsp. salt to the cream cheese mixture and I also used mini chocolate chips. To avoid the filling from sinking to the bottom, I used a Tbs cookie scoop and just put the filling on top. Moist and delicious! No need for frosting.

Wonderful!!!  Only substituted applesauce for the oil in the cake mix and they came out so moist and delicious!  Inverted them and topped them with an easy chocolate ganache and served them as mini cakes.  The family raved about them!  The filling did go straight to the bottom but the taste was outstanding!

Yum!  Big hit with everyone!  I had no trouble w/ the filling - used mini choc chips.  Filled almost 2/3 full w/ cake batter, put 1-2T. filling and then just barely covered the top of the filling w/ more cake batter.  They were delicious!  I will experiment with different fillings next time!

These were pretty good.  Based on others' comments about sinking filling, I divided things up.  The mini chocolate chips did sink right to the bottom.  The filling without any chips, however, did not sink, and those cupcakes were, by far, more delicious.  If I were to try this again, I'd probably make a carrot cake frosting, minus the nuts, for the center.  Somebody posted that a spice cake worked well, so I bet that such a combination would be great!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC AND SIMPLE!!  The recipe makes more than 12, I got 21 generously sized cupcakes.  The filling is awesome and makes more than needed as well.  I saved the extra for almost a complete other batch, which I froze.  I used mini chips, and had no problems with the filling sinking, as other people seemed to. I used a chocolate frosting and a devils food cake mix.  I'm going to try out the "self filled cupcakes II" recipe next time, it looks about the same as this one, but it probably makes less filling.  This recipe will be used again and again for sure.

FANTASTIC!  I cut the calories by using fat free cream cheese and substituting applesauce for the oil.  I also used yellow cake.  They baked up perfectly. I will definitely make these again.

I will have to try this one again, and better blend the filling.  My results seemed a bit "eggy".  I also didn't add chocolate chips and used a yellow cake (so there could be my problem).

These cupcakes were great! So moist and tasty!Very easy to make and very few ingredients. I read there was too much filling left over, so I only added chocolate chips to half the filling, using it in the chocolate chip mix. The other half I added coconut and pecans to and put it in pineapple cake mix. Turned out great! Thank you Star for the great recipe with endless possibilities!

Thankfully I don't have to give an oral review of this recipe since my mouth is full of chocolate cupcakes!!!!!!!!  These were incredible!  So easy to make and they tasted fabulous.  I didn't add any frosting on the top and they were still excellent-just the right amount of sweet (and trust me, I don't have just a sweet TOOTH-it's more like a whole mouth full of sweet cravings!)  Try these cupcakes, you will love them.  Thanks for sharing such an excellent recipe.

using 1 tsp. of filling really leaves you with alot left over, which I think is a waste of ingredients, so next time I will cut that in half.......also, it makes more than 12 cupcakes!

I've made these for years and they are always a huge hit.  I usually use a dark chocolate cake mix.  I think they are rich enough that they don't need frosting, but they are prettier with a dollop of chocolate or cream cheese frosting.  The white frosting in the picture does not seem to match the cupcake flavors.  I don't know why readers are concerned with seeing the filling on the top or the pit sometimes caused when the filling sinks.  It's part of the character of these cupcakes.  They are filled and the filling is heavy so naturally, it will sink.  Putting the filling in last will keep it from sinking all the way to the bottom.  If you put it in the middle it will end up mostly on the bottom. This filling is not light and fluffy.  It's more like a cheesecake...heavy and rich.

The first time I made these, I followed the directions exactly, but didn't like that the chocolate chips were hard inside the cupcake. So the next time I made them, I melted the chocolate chips first before adding them to the cream cheese mixture.  I think they turned out better!  Nice and moist inside.

Oh, these are so good.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception that I put a tad more filling in each c.c. I had some batter left for about 4 more cupcakes, but I didn't want to keep oven on for just four, so I used 2 large glass pyrex custard cups and made 2 BIG ones. I didn't have any leftover batter nor filling...Perfect.  Cannot wait to make these again.  Be sure to check them before the suggested baking time on package because ovens are not all the same....Thanks for a different cupcake.

Overall, this is a very good recipe for those who don't want to do this kind of cupcake by making a cake batter from scratch. 

For my 1st time, I used BC milk chocolate cake mix with 1 tsp. of Godiva liqueur thrown in for good measure. Instead of choc. chips I used some crushed Heath bars. Definitely use more than 1 tsp. of the cream cheese mix in these cupcakes... I followed the directions and now I regret that decision because I have leftover cream cheese mix in the refrigerator and 24 cupcakes that could use some more of the real good stuff in them. 

I followed some other posters' advice and mixed the cream cheese, sugar and egg inside a quart-size plastic bag. Super easy to just clip a corner off and use it to pipe the mix into the pans. No muss, no fuss!

I made this recipe with cupcakes and it was delicious (used devil's food!)  And just now, I made it as a whole 9x13 self-filling cake!  No one had done this before (or at least, I didn't see it in the reviews,) so I was working kind of blind.  At first, I took the cake out too soon (30 minutes.)  But the middle was still liquid.  I didn't notice until it started to fall in the middle.   So I put it back in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes longer and it came out fine (maybe a little overdone.)  I won't know how it tastes until my boyfriend brings it to work for his xmas party in two days, but it smells nice.  Oh, also, I made it with yellow cake mix and will be topping with Cream Cheese Frosting II.

I gave this a 4 star rating because the filling sank to the bottom and when you take the cupcake foil off the filling in the bottom is heavy and came off with it. It does taste very good, but it is very rich. I think if I make these again I will not put in the chocolate chips. Also, fill the cupcakes 1/2 full with cake mix before putting in the cream cheese filling, maybe then it will not sink to the bottom????

These cupcakes are amazing.  I use the Sturdy Whipped Cream frosting from this site to top them.  The only problem I have is that my cupcakes tend to sink in the middle as they cool.

Very good. I like the idea of filling in the cupcakes. I think it was a little too sweet for me though. I used Red Velvet cake mix and everyone loved it. This recipe was also on the back of the box, except they added coconut to it.

These were excellent but I didn't give them 5 full stars because of the consistency when they came out of the oven.  The cake part was done but the cream cheese filling was still fairly gooey, which made them fall apart easily.  I would love to make them again but I may substitute powdered sugar in place of granulated--I'm hoping that will make the filling slightly more stiff.  Otherwise they tasted great and don't need any frosting (they're already so rich we compared it to putting frosting on a candy bar!)

Seriously delicious!  I LOVED them & I consider myself a fairly tough critic.  Not a foodie per se but probably pickier than any of my friends.  They were great!  My husband didn't like the choco chips w/the cream cheese, but I did & it would be easy enough to leave them out if you prefer it.  I took another reviewer's advice & put a little batter in bottom of cupcake paper, pushed it up the sides a little, added a spoonful of the cream cheese mixture, then added the rest of the batter.  I used a BC cake mix & I did have to bake them a little longer than on the box, so maybe other people did too.  I will absolutely make these again!!!

I've had this recipe for ages, but never made it until I saw this one & compared them. I did use the other recipes sugar amount of 1/3c because we don't need all that sugar. Love the idea of these cupcakes & used others suggestion of only filling 1/2 full, but that still didn't help - I had a mess. I'll make again, but only fill 1/4 - 1/3 full & cut back the filling to 1/2 amounts because it made so much. You don't need to ice or drizzle these because they are very moist & sweet enough.

I hoped to follow this recipe exactly as written, but I didn't have any cake mix at hand.  I did have a box of brownie mix, so I used that and went by the more cake-like brownie instructions that called for the use of 3 eggs instead of 2.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of milk to the batter.  I made the cream cheese portion as instruction but mixed it in a food processor and let it blend long enough for the mixture to really thicken.  I put a tablespoon of the brownie batter into each cup with 2 tablespoons of cheese mixture on top then filled the rest o the cups to the rims with brownie batter.  I had a small amount of brownie batter left over.  I let bake for half an hour.  They came out looking like a mosaic cupcake rather than a filled one.  Nonetheless, this got great reviews, both unfrosted and with milk chocolate frosting.

The best cupcake recipe ever...This is the only kind of cupcake to make. Made this with the hard chocolate glaze recipe (on this site) and were such a huge hit with the family.   I am making this recipe at this moment but instead of the cupcake I am making it into a bunt cake. Going to put the hard chocolate glaze on it. Taking it to work for a coworkers birthday. Cant wait to dig in.

I use various types of chocolate fudge/devil's food cake mix.  My experience with this recipe is that the most tedious part of the entire process is trying to divide up the batter and the filling and then topping off with more batter and not running out before filling up the 24 muffin molds.  THEREFORE, I determined that if I make a tad more cream cheese filling, then I have solved the dilemma.   For the cream cheese filling, I use about 10 ounces of cream cheese; 1 egg; 1/2 c. sugar; 1 c. of semisweet mini choc. chips.  Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature before creaming cheese.   I always end up with 24 reg. sized cupcakes.  I fill the liners about 40% full with chocolate batter.  Then I plop a big heaping tablespoon of chocolate chip filling, then a final tablespoon or so of chocolate cake batter on top.  I bake the cupcakes per the boxed cake recommendations.    I frost these cupcakes with vanilla cream cheese frosting.  8oz. of cream cheese; 4 oz. of butter; 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 pound of powdered sugar.  This makes a LOT of frosting, and all my friends LOVE the decadence of the gooey cream cheese frosting with the "surprise" filling cupcakes.    Lately I have been lightly spraying the muffin tins with Pam BEFORE I place the paper liners, as I always end up making little spills here and there and using the Pam makes their removal easier.  ENJOY THE CALORIES.

As a cupcake man & a flapjack flipper id have to say that these are some of the best cupcakes Ive made. Fill the cups 1/2 full instead of 3/4 otherwise the recipe is perfect

Okay I needed to make 24 cupcakes so I changed the quantity to 24 (probably just not thinking right since I wasn't feeling well) and I was able to make 24 cupcakes AND a full size cake LOL...I made these for my son birthday and replaced the chocolate chips with mini baking M&M's.  I put a small scoop of mix in the baking cups (the size of a cookie scoop), added a heaping spoonful of the filling and then topped it with the rest of the mix.  I filled them full since I had TONS of mix.  I frosted these with the sturdy whipped cream frosting from this site.  With the remainder I made a bunt cake and just put the filling around the middle of the cake and topped it off with remainder.

These were the best cupcakes I've made!  Mine usually turn out too dry, but these were soooo moist.  I used chocolate cake mix and cream cheese frosting.  They were delicious!  Thanks.

I followed others advice to put in 1/4 cup of chocolate before the cream filling.  I feel I didn't put enough cream filling in each cupcake for fear it would seep out the sides. There was only a hint of the cream filling but everyone still loved them

I am with Joebaker's rating on this one.  These do not taste like they are made with a cake mix at all.  They are great with the Hard Chocolate Glaze listed on this website.  I took these to a birthday party and it was a HUGE hit.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

GOOD NIGHT!! These little things are good! I followed the recipe to a "T" & it turned out great! Made exactly 24 with no left over batter or filling. My filling seemed runny but it baked up just fine. I wasn't going to add the chips, but I'm glad I did. They were like chocolate lava in the cream cheese filling. Fill a gallon ziplock baggie with the batter for an easy way to accurately fill the cups. And remember... never fill the cup to the top!

This recipe was disappointing in my opinion.  I was expecting more flavor from the cream cheese filling.  Tasted like a box cake mix with a little something extra inside.  It wasn't bad, just not what I expected.  Followed the recipe exactly as described.

This recipe is simple and tasty but, really, these are essentially just iced black bottoms.  For that reason, the recipe doesn't knock my socks off.  It's really more like 3.5 stars but I rounded up.  I agree with the others who mentioned that it makes more like 2 dozen and that you should only fill 1/4 for the first layer.  I used one of those tablespoon sized ice cream-style scoopers (Pampered Chef among others makes them) for the filling and that worked well.  I also used Egg Beaters in the filling and for one of the eggs in the cake, as well as light cream cheese -- didn't seem to take away from the flavor and it definitely cuts the fat/calories.

Very good recipe.  I placed 1 heaping Tbls. of cream in the center of the cupcake and then dropped a dollop of batter over the top.  I smoothed the batter over top of the filling with the back of the spoon.  I think I will put a little more sugar in the cream cheese filling next time as I would like it to be a little more sweet.

These were my first time making proper cupcakes and they were fantastic! It's so simple and they come out delicious! Everyone loved it and I even got "they're to die for!". I would definitely follow the suggestions on spooning quantities and they do make at least 2 full trays(24 cupcakes), if not more.

So easy! I followed recipe as listed except I only used 1/2 cup choc chips & roughly chopped them before mixing in.  I frosted w/ canned choc frosting & served chilled from the fridge.  Got lots of compliments. I'll make these again.

These are so easy to make. They look wonderful and are very rich and tasty.  I followed the recipe except for adding a bit of vanilla in my cream cheese filling.  I agree with some other reviewers that the chocolate chips would be better if they were the mini size.  I really like the addition of the chips though.  I did what some reviewers suggested - I filled the paper liners with the cake batter to about 2/3 full then plopped a big teaspoon of filling on top.  I was surprised that the filling did not sink after baking but pretty much stayed on top.  I should have followed that particular instruction to cover the filling.  It looked nice and swirly like on top of the cupcake but it would have been nicer as a filling in the center. Plus, when I covered the cooled cupcakes with a nice white buttercream icing, all of the richness was at the top because the cream cheese filling was basically right under the frosting.  Next time I will cover the  filling.I got 17 very full cupcakes out of this recipe.  Oh, and you DO have to add way more than 1 tsp of filling per cupcake. I had to go   back and add way more per cup.  1 tsp is NOT enough. More like a heaping tablespoon. Don't worry, it's not too much for the cupcake.  It definitely makes it better.   I can't wait to try this with white cake and/or red velvet.

These were terrific...gone in one sitting!  Extremely easy to make.  The only problem I had was not quite being able to properly measure the filling to batter ratio.  But, that's probably my fault.  Otherwise, got rave reviews and will definately make these again.

OK - here's the deal. I too had the issue with the filling sinking and leaving a large hole in the middle of each cupcake. But I remember my mother making these when I was little and she never had that problem. I was determined to get it right - so I made another batch. This time I mixed up the filling with a spoon and not a mixer, I omitted the mini chocolate chips in the filling, and I was very careful to only fill each cup 3/4 of the way full. (My first unfortunate batch I filled up to the top). This second batch turned out perfect. The blob of cream cheese filling is perfectly suspended in the middle of each little cupcake. Success!

These cupcakes are great and so easy to make.  I used chocolate cake mix with strawberry cream cheese and it turned out delicious!  It did make a lot more than I expected it to though.  It was enough to make over two dozen cupcakes!
Update:  I made these again a few days ago with a friend.  We used "caramel/milk-chocolate swirl" chips that I picked up at the grocery store instead of the regular chocolate chips.  It was amazing!!!!  I think they were the best cupcakes I've ever tasted!

Super moist.  I did not have the chocolate chips.  The cupcakes were great without them.  Take the advice of only filling the bottom 1/4 batter, tsp to TBL of cream cheese mixture and fill the rest to only 2/3. My cupcakes cam out perfect using this method.  I would make again.

OMG!  These were incredible!!  Definitely makes 24 (I'm not admitting how many I ate!).  I filled the cupcake liners a little more than halfway, used a tablespoon of filling in each, then topped with just enough batter to cover the filling (about a tablespoon).  I covered the lower rack in the oven with tin foil, just in case they overflowed, but they didn't.  Frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II.  They are fantastic!  I will never make plain cupcakes again.

These are a favorite for my husband!  He asks for these on his birthday every year!  I put at least a tablespoon of filling in each cupcake, and the filling sinks as it bakes, so there's no need to put more batter on top.  This year I tried putting this recipe in a bundt pan.  I put the cake batter in (I use devils food), then filling, and topped it with more batter.  I frosted it with ganache.  It was the best!

Update 3/17/10:  I made these using a mint white chocolate chip and tinted the cream cheese frosting green piping it on in shamrock shapes for St Patty's Day potluck at work.  They were a hit and I can't wait to eat the ones I left at home tonight!  I had also made these using a red velvet cake mix for Christmas and they were very pretty.

Wonderful!!!  I took these to a Memorial Day Shrimp Boil expecting to come home with some.  I brought 2 home (only because I closed the container to hide them)!  One person thought it was all from scratch and did not believe it was a cake mix.  I did follow suggestions and added about 1 tablespoon filling to each and only filled the bottom layer to about 1/4.  I also used the Cream cheese frosting also suggested.  They are very moist without the frosting but the frosting adds that sinful indulgence touch.  My husband who is a chocolate cake/cupcake purist was sceptical about the filling but after he inhaled 2 in a row I knew we had a winner.  This is the only chocolate cupcake recipe I will use from now on.

Wow!! I made these for v-day for work and my boss at 3 and brought 2 home for his pregnant wife. I made Choc with choc chip, Choc with peanut butter chips, and vanilla with choc chip.  I didn't have a single one to bring home.

Ok, i stupidly ignored another reviewer suggestion to only fill 1/2 - 1/3 of the pan, i fill it to 3/4 and it totally overflowed. 
I also add some instant coffee to the water and a tbsp of coco powder coz i'm a chocoholic. It really brings out the chocolate taste but make sure you add more sugar accordingly.

To be honest, this recipe taste good, but nothing to wow the crowd either, but i guess with few changes here and there it could be spectacular.

Thought these were yummy!!  Not good straight from the oven though, gotta let them cool!  We did frost them with a whipped white frosting (canned) and that was light enough and made them taste great!
Quick and easy, thank you!

I made these for my sons wrestling banquet.  Hands down a hit!! The only change I made was to use mini chips.  I also added more filling to each cup and didn't have any problems with it sinking to the bottom or any leftover.  I used buttercream icing.  I loved the moist texture of the cupcake and the cheesecake filling was to die for.  Needless to say the few boys still cutting weight for this weekends matches were just dying to eat them after hearing all the other guys rave about them!!

These could be the yummiest cupcakes I have ever had. The amount of work compared the results is AWESOME. I also make homemade cream cheese icing for them. Try different flavors, you won't be disappointed.

The filling was nice and kept the cupcake moist in the middle. I added most of the batter then added the filling and it didn't float to the bottom like others.  I used a yellow batter and it came out great, also using mini chocolate chips and pink food coloring.

My friends loved these! I frosted them with homemade cream cheese frosting and topped with flaked coconut.  I made the frosting pastel-colored, so it was really pretty, as well as tasty. I highly recommend topping with coconut.

I made these for a small barbeque with a couple of friends and they were a huge hit! Everyone had seconds and thirds and even fourths! They even asked for them the next day too! I frosted the cupcakes with chocolate chip fudge frosting to make them extra chocolatey. Definitely will be making these again!

I am rating this recipe only 2 stars because, while the flavour of the cupcakes was good, it was not a result of the recipe...cake mixes just taste good.  I had the same problem that others had in that the cream cheese mix floated to the bottom of the cupcakes and cooked there.  In the end, we found that you couldn't really taste the cream cheese mixture at all...and I had a LOT left over.  Thanks for the recipe, but we probably won't make again.

Good, not great.  Next time, I'll save myself the extra work and just make good ol' cupcakes from the boxed cake mix.  I just didn't think that these were worth all the extra effort.  A good flavor cake mix paired with just the right flavor frosting is way better than trying to figure out if you can taste the cream cheese filling or not.  Not to mention that one pan out of the two I made sank in the middle despite following other reviewers' advice...  Ah well...

I used vanilla icing instead of cream cheese or chocolate. I thought the other two might be too rich and sweet. The vanilla icing added just the right touch. I also followed the advice of filling the cupcake liners 1/4 full with cake batter, then 1 tablespoon of filling, then topping off with more cake batter.  I baked them for 20 minutes and they turned out perfect!

My family "loves" this recipe.  After reading other reviews, I decided to use mini choc chips (worked out great).  I also used red velvet cake mix and plan to try other varieties.  Lemon cake mix with cream cheese filling and frosting (omitting chips) sounds wonderful too.  Thanks a bunch.

I have made these cupcakes several times now, and each time I changed the center, one time with white chips and some rasberries, once with chocolate chip and last night with toffee chips.  My husband and my coworkers love these cupcakes, ask for them all the time.  If I could I would give this six stars.  Also, the go great with the recipe for buttercream frosting.

I love this recipe! It is my standard cupcake recipe anytime I need to bring a dessert to an event because it gives such a big payoff for so little work. Plus, it's versatile! I have followed the recipe to the letter and had great results, but I've also done different chip and frosting combinations, too: peanut butter chips with peanut butter frosting, mint chocolate chips with mint chocolate frosting. They're all great! As stated previously, this recipe really makes at least 24 cupcakes. And I usually put double the filling in the cupcake and it turns out great. Even with the doubling, I usually still have filling leftover, so I follow one reviewer's advice and put it in mini muffin tins and bake so I have several mini cheesecakes. Thanks for a definite keeper recipe!

I really liked the flavor and idea of this recipe, but I didn't like the way that the "filling" sunk to the bottom.  I thought about baking the 1/2-full cupcakes for a few minutes first (just long enough for the batter to set up), then the cream cheese mixture followed by the remaining batter, then finish baking them.  I'm not sure how this would work, but I think the cream cheese layer would keep the very bottom from drying out.  They were very moist when I made them and they actually soaked through the paper muffin wrappers.  I used some foil wrappers as well and those looked much better.

Pretty good.  We used French Vanilla cake batter and white frosting (dyed different colors for Easter) and they turned out great.  The only thing disappointing about these cupcakes were that the filling "sunk" down to the bottom of the cupcake and had more chocolate chip flavor than cream cheese by far.  I'll try again and alter a little here and there :)

These were fun to make and tasted really good.  I put the cream cheese mixture into the fridge while I was making the cake batter.  This helped w/the "runniness".  I got 24 cupcakes by using the tablespoon measuring spoon.

Recipe made 24 instead of 12 cupcakes. I added melted white and dark chocolate chips and drizzled over the top to make them look pretty. Needed more cream cheese filling in each cupcake to get a five star rating. Will make again, but will double filling next time.

Yes I agree a very good recipe, BUT don't make the mistake I did and not read all the reviews. The 1 doz amount is off by 1 doz! Not that I mind now that I have got them made but I was in a hurry and had to take time out to ice double the amount, and that was after I already doubled this recipe so I ended up with 48! I used the Chocolate Frosting 1 recipe on this site and it was bomb!

This stuff is awesome!  I didn't feel like making cupcakes so I just made a 13x9 pan and cooked it for 30 minutes.  It is really soft and moist and good.  I made it Saturnday night and half of it was gone in about 2 hours.  It is very, very good and I heartily recommend it!

Oh yes! I made these for my son's 5th birthday, for him to take to school. The teachers all RAVED about them! I altered the box cake recipe a bit, but used the filling recipe to the letter. I doubled it, and used the leftovers by themselves (I kept those for myself, SO good!).  Definately a nice twist to otherwise boring chocolate cupcakes, with a minimum of work!

Pretty good, moist and tasty. Like others said though, the chips fell to the bottom. I couldn’t find any mini chips. I didn’t care for the taste of the semi-sweet chips in this particular recipe, maybe next time I’ll try milk chocolate instead.

This was a great recipe and I will be making this again soon! I took the advice of other reviewers on how much batter to put in and they came out perfectly! Topped it with chocolate frosting and semi sweet chocolate chips for the ultimate decadent dessert.

Recipe called for putting a teaspoon of the filling in each cupcake.  But when I did that, I ended up with a lot of leftover filling, and came up short on the chocolate cake batter.   I think a tablespoon of filling for each cupcake would be perfect.  The cupcakes were very tasty anyway.  I took them to a birthday party and got lots of compliments.

I made them and they were super yummy!:) I might flavour the cream chesse a bit next time, maybe add cherries or strawberries to the filling. I always use coconut oil for the packaged cakes and it keeps them really moist and fluffy, and for my second batch I didn't quite have enough batter so I dipped my spatula down the side of the muffin tins and just buried the filling a bit and it stayed near the top.

I made these for a girls get-together and they were devoured!  I didn’t change anything about the recipe except I added about a half teaspoon of almond flavoring to the filling.  I did use mini chips as one reviewer suggested.  I topped all but two of them with vanilla butter cream.  They were equally as delicious without the frosting.  In fact, if you can stand to wait a day before eating they get all creamy and the chocolate flavor gets richer.

These do taste wonderful, but I'm not very happy with the filling.  It did drip to the bottom.  And I thought the chips would get gooier, maybe even melt.  I used Guittard chips, and they're pretty big, which probably wasn't a good choice.  I'd like to make them again with the smaller chips like other recommend.  (I searched for this recipe on my phone and couldn't read the full reviews.)  

I used devils food cake mix and a homemade chocolate cream cheese frosting.

Tasty. I made mini cupcakes and they turned out pretty good. The first batch were regular sized and got tossed b/c they were underdone on top & overcooked on bottom. I slightly lowered temp and watched the rest closely.

Made these and added an extra egg yolk to the cake mix along with vanilla and additional cocoa and sugar.  Used mini semisweet chips, and then used the standard chocolate frosting on the Hershey's cocoa box. Very good!

Tastes fine, but if you're looking for a shortcut to filling your cupcakes, this doesn't turn out quite right. What you get is more of a chocolate cupcake with a 'different coloured' centre, with the centre still being a chewy cakey cheese thing.

OK, I haven't read all 330+ reviews to see if anyone else tried this, but I'll tell you what I did. I filled a pastry bag with the filling and, and used a very large round hole (Ateco #807) pastry tip so that the mini chips would come through. I filled the cupcake liners with the chocolate cake batter to make sure I ended up with 24 (and I actually could have gotten a couple more, so I tried to divide up the rest to even it out over all). Then I injected the filling into the cupcakes. As the filling is injected, you can see the batter rise to the level that you want to have when you put them in to bake. Had I not had a little spillage into the kitchen sink before I finished injecting the cupcakes, I would have had precisely enough for all 24 cupcakes. Now, when you do this, you will still see some of the white filling on top of the cupcake, but not to worry. If you're icing them, no one will be looking for that there. Hope this helps someone. :-)

Filling sank to the bottom too but it still turned out good.  Used white chocolate chips that I chipped in the food processor (won't do that again since it didn't help much) and strawberry cake mix with cream cheese frosting.  I thought I mixed the filling long enough but next time I will do it longer to see if that helps.  Definitely only bake 18 minutes.

Made alot of filling, I put at least a tablespoon in each and still had more left, used home made cake. Put a little batter in botton, piped the filling on then topped with more cake. Frosted with whipped cream cheese frosting. Very good!

Not sure what happened by my filling was super runny and ended up having more of a swirl effect in the cupcake. Perhaps it was because I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese? May try again...we shall see.

These guys were a hit. I was worried about the cream cheese mix as it was very runny and I used just a little extra cheese than it called for. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the filling. The filling didn't sink and they cooked perfectly. Only trouble I had was I WOULD have had 24 out of the batch but I only had one muffin pan so had to make 12 first and I was just a little too generous with filling them (they overflowed slightly) and ended up with 21. They didn't need icing! These stand on their own. Thanks for sharing this, Star.

These cupcakes are fabulous!  Someone suggested putting the mix in a ziploc bag to pipe it into the muffin tins....I took it one step further and actually mixed my batter in the ziploc bag.  It worked great!  I had no issues with amounts, worked out evenly.  I didn't ice mine as we all felt that would have been too much.  Just gave them a dusting of icing sugar.  I made one batch in a beautiful flower muffin tin I have and the ladies wouldn't believe I made them.

I used a vanilla cake mix for this and I added cocoa powder to the cream cheese filling instead of chocolate chips. I also filled my cupcake liners 1/2 full of cake batter and piped the cream cheese mixture into the center of the cupcake until my cups were 2/3 full. My filling did sink to the bottom of my cupcakes, not sure if its because I didn't whip it long enough in my KA mixer, or if its because I piped it in but either way it still tasted delicious... it reminded me of chocolate mousse because of the cocoa powder I added. It was light, fluffy and ill make this again in the future. Although I may try and omit the egg from the filling and pipe it into an already baked cupcake just to see if it works. Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best chocolate cupcakes!  I have made them several times and they always come out perfect.  I use mini choc. chips in the cream cheese filling and frost them with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site--  PERFECT!

I consider myself a good baker.  I followed the directions to the letter and also filled the muffin papers 1/4 full etc etc.  I had plenty of batter and filling for all but ONE muffin, and I made 24.  These were NOTHING special. They turned out moist and tasted GREAT, but all the extra work of layer  all 24, I expected the results to be phenomonal.  They were good, but, I won't be making them again.

If they are good, yes they are. However, they still miss the decadent taste you get from homemade cupcakes or good pastry store one. They were tender, soft and moist but they still had that cake mix lingering taste. Next time, I will find a recipe that makes you start from scratch. A more time-consuming task, most likely, but I don't care if it gives me a cupcake with heavenly taste.  Yours, William  P.S. The cream cheese filing is a good idea

This is a very nice, quick way to whip up a special cupcake.  I ended up making 24 out of this recipe, with just a little filling left over.  My seven year old said it tasted like a cheesecake inside.  I used buttercream for the frosting, because I had it, but I will use a chocolate glaze next time.

I made these with a spice cake mix, I also added 1 can of sliced carrots, pureed. Then instead of chocolate chips I used butterscotch chips, nice fall tailgating dessert.  They were a huge hit!  Thanks for the recipe.

These cupcakes are fantastic.  I made the recipe as written the first time and they were delicious - but the cream cheese ended up on the bottom of the cakes (still delicious).  Each time since then, I've used mini chips as other have suggested.  I also filled the cupcake liners 1/2 full, topped with the cream cheese mixture and then added just a dollop more of cake batter.

I just made this filling with chocolate cupcakes it was FANTASTIC! I would use this again and again but maybe next time not the choc. chips because the flavor clashed a little bit with my triple choc. cupcakes but would be great with another type next time.  It made them so moist and creamy, great idea and recipe!

these cupcakes are now my signature treat for gatherings...and everyone ALWAYS loves them so. i use the ducan hines dark chocolate fudge mix for extra richness...don't put too much batter in, it can leak over the sides. i've started making my own cream cheese frosting lately and actually piping it on! doesn't take much talent to look quite talented. thanks for sharing.

Great Recipe, fairly simple and a big hit. I left out the choco chips as I didn't have any on hand.  Made twice but the second time around used the suggestion to pipe the batter into the cups using a plastic bag with the tip of the bag cut off, made the process soo much easier!

For my daughter's 5th birthday party at preschool, I made banana cake cupcakes and filled with this recipe.   I needed to make extra cream cheese frosting to top the cupcakes, and then I added sliced strawberries on the top.  The banana, strawberry, chocolate, and cream cheese are really yummy all together!

Good but not great.  My family liked them and they were kind of tasty but they tasted like a boxed cake mix and I would prefer something a little more homemade tasting.  The filling was GREAT however and I will probably use that again.

These were very good.  Next time I will use more than one tsp of filling per cupcake.  I will also decrease the amount of oil called for in the cake mix.

These were very easy to make.  I did take another user's advice and only filled cupcake pan up 1/4 way instead of 2/3, for initial filling.  This made it way you could fit everything needed into cupcake and wasn't left with waste.  I might cook them just a few minutes longer next time because they were very soft because of cream cheese and have tendency to fall apart.  But nonetheless, the kids at church loved these and wanted more when they ran out!!!

I didn't make these, but just had them at a party.  I normally don't like chocolate cupcakes, but these were amazing!  Top with a good frosting like the one I had - made with whipped cream, butter, melted chocolate chips, and powdered sugar.

My husband needed for me to make cupcakes for the Christmas Party for his work. I didn't want to make the same cupcakes as usual. So I made these and everyone at his work loved them. They enjoyed the ooey gooey surprise in the middle. They are delicious! The only change I made was I used a red velvet cake mix and cream cheese icing with sprinkles on top! They were so festive! This recipe is so easy and fun to do. You have to just give it a try for something extra sweet.

When the cupcakes first came out of the oven, they were just okay.  After they had cooled for a while, and frosted, they were out of this world!  The cake stays incredibly moist.  I also added the mini chocolate chips to the cake batter and it was delicious!!

i followed the recipe as written, but excluded the chocolate chips (didn't have any on hand) and it turned out wonderfully! i didn't have problems with the cream cheese sinking, possibly because i used a blender?

i baked them at 180C for 20 minutes, which was a bit too short (they fell later on). the first batch of 6 giant muffins didn't turn out as good as the second, when i included twice the amount of cream cheese mixture (i didn't have any cake or c.c. mixture leftover, by the way). 

great taste, beautiful cupcake.. i think it would be even better tasting and looking if you doubled the amount of cream cheese, putting in two layers of c.c. and three of chocolate.

Great recipe! Somehow I ended up with 27 cupcakes not 12 as the recipe indicated. I followed suggestions for adding toffee bits and mini chocolate chips, think next time I'll add more! Also followed the suggestion to use JJ's cream cheese II icing.  I ended up with way too much icing, so next time will halve the recipe.  Found that the cakes with more filling tended to collapse deeper than ones with less.  Next time will do less filling as well. Another touch was stirring 1/2 cup chocolate pudding to the cake batter, made them extra moist. These cupcakes tasted and held together much better the next day sitting overnight in the fridge. A good "make the night before" recipe.

I sit here savoring these little pieces of heaven.  I went with the Dark Chocolate Cake mix and Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chips.  I highly recommend the Ghirardelli, they are very superior to regular Tollhouse.  The muffins puffed up a lot, so I'll use the tip another offered and fill a bit less.  I would also increase the filling a bit.  They blended nicely, a bit of the filling leached through the top.  The cake mix was wonderful, very sharp and very light.  I made some in those fancy upside down cake tins (bigger than a muffin, like 6 on a tray).  Then filled the crater with frosting and a cherry.

These are the best!  Just make sure you don't over fill.  The cups should be 2/3 full with all the layers.  The recipe makes about 30 cupcakes, too.  I made 12 cupcakes and poured the rest in a 9" pan. The cake was even better than cupcakes.  Great recipe and easy.

No alterations, I made as directed and they turned out great. Both kids and husband loved them, used chocolate cheese frosting from here to frost.

Yummmmm, great way to use a mix and make it more like homemade. I found no need to add mini chips to the filling when using a good chocolate frosting.

These are really yummy. I had a bunch of the cream cheese mixture leftover so I would modify the recipe a bit. When it says to add 1 teaspoon of cream cheese to the center, I would say to add a heaping tablespoon. But, everybody loved these at our last Family Dinner.

I ate 3 of these already and they're not even cooled off. I made them according to directions, and then I also made a batch of them using yellow cake mix, with cocoa in the filling. I had some chocolate mix left over so I did some with chocolate bottoms and yellow tops. I should have done them all this way because YUM!!!
I used cream cheese frosting II and they are just divine.

These cupcakes were delicious. I have a similar homemade version recipe, but this recipe was so much quicker and easier and tastes just as good or better! I recommend using a devils food cake mix and put 1 teaspoon of vanilla in with the cream cheese mixture...yummy! Also, this made about 18 cupcakes for me. Definitely use one large tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture per cupcake instead of just a teaspoon. The more filling per cupcake, the better!Baked 22 minutes and came out perfect. Enjoyed these a great deal and will make again and forget my "from scratch" similar recipe. thanks!

There were good, but I think that next time I will use less cake batter in each cupcake to make about 30 (or more) instead of 24.  I, like others, had lots of cream cheese filling left over (almost half) and cupcakes would have overflowed the papers if I had tried to use it all.  These got lots of compliments.  I might try strawberry cake mix next time also.

I made a batch of these for a picnic last weekend, went over so well made another batch for a cookout the next day. I didn't add the second batch of batter, just dropped the cream cheese onto the batter and baked it. A real easy dessert for kids and a keeper recipe.

Okay these are a super simple and soo good! I agree with many others to use the mini chocolate chips, but I also doubled the filling recipe and put let batter in with each cupcake...mmm they were great! Best to eat about 5-10 minutes after they get out of the oven when the chocolate chips are still melty! Mmm loved it.

OMG these were great.  They will now be my go to recipe for cupcakes.  I use a combination of regular chips and chopped chipped. I had extra filling left, next time, I will add more filling into the cupcakes. Nice and moist and nice surprise in the middle.

I used the idea of strawberry cream cheese and white chocolate chips,they were amazing!

But I wasted at least one half of the cream cheese and choc chips because there was more than half left over.  I'm not sure if we have to make this much to use one egg or what.  but if you can split an egg, I would split the cream cheese, sugar and choc chips.

These cupcakes are just okay. I would have rather just made the box cupcake recipe and not have went through the whole cream cheese trouble. my filling sank, And that wasn't ness. a problem, but the choc. chips don't melt, and they give an odd flavor. The filling is very plain and I even had one person ask me if they were still uncooked in the middle, which they wern't but it was just the filling, it was goopy. They did tast good after I frosted them. But not worth the xtra effort.

Brought these to a potluck and they were the first dessert to dissapear. It made three dozens of mini cupcakes and one dozen of regular sized cupcakes. The mini cupcakes were well recieved and were conveniently bite sized. The cream cheese mixture did sink quite a bit in the large ones but looked pretty when cut in half because of the filling.

I kept the recipe similar  reducing the sugar to 1/3 c.,  a dash of salt, and less chocolate chips.  I have made them twice so far and they have been a big hit. This time, however, with the extra filling I made cupcakes (just added crushed graham crackers with butter mixed to the bottom of the cupcake tin.  Wow!  Really good.

This was great! Here's how I modified it: I used powered sugar instead of granulated, I added a bit more sugar than it called for, I used Devil's Food cake mix, I used mini-choc chips instead of regular, and I topped with a THIN layer of Milk Chocolate icing. They were great! I am taking them to a pot luck tonight! :)

I was between giving this 3 and 4 stars. The cupcakes were good, but I'm not sure if they would have been just as good if I just made the boxed recipe. I couldn't taste the cream cheese filling. My husband said he could, but I think he may have been just tasting the cream cheese frosting I used! I added toffee bits instead of mini chocolate chips, and they ended up just dissolving into the batter. Next time I'll try the mini chips. These DO taste good, but I was expecting more, I think.

DO NOT use Betty Crocker Super Moist Butter Recipe Choc cake mix for these.  My daughter took one bite, then put in trash.  I think it's  all in the mix.  The filling was good but the cake was to spongy, next time will try with our favorite brownie mix (adding extra egg for more cake like).  These should not be that fluffy.  Maybe use a different cake mix.  Will try again.

Very good! I didn't change anything and they were great. Try them with carmel frosting! Sweet and yummy.

Great flavor.  I tried a different method and just put the cream cheese mixture on the top of the cake batter and had hoped it would sink under as it cooked. Unfortunately, my plan didn't work.  But, they still came out great.  I am planning on frosting them with a little chocolate frosting and then using some leftover cream cheese frosting to make an "x" across the top.  (Like marking my not-so-buried treasure).

The flavor of the filling was fantastic with a devil's food cake mix that I added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 package chocolate pudding to.  There was way more filling than I needed, and, like some of the other reviewiers, I think that I would not fill the cups as full before putting the filling in.

I'm giving these 4 stars just because of the filling the cupcake liners directions are lacking.  The flavor gets TEN STARS!!!  As for filling the cupcakes, I filled the bottom of the cup with about a teaspoon of cake, then added a teaspoon of filling and then filled the holder up to about 2/3 full with more cake.  If you fill them full they go way over the top and you have a mess.  I used a butter flavor chocolate cake mix.  Since I was serving these with homemade ice cream I just dusted them with powdered sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly. The filling in my first batch spread throughout the cake and the chocolate chips sank to the bottom. So for the second batch I filled the cup 50% chocolate cake followed by 50% cream cheese mixture. The result was perfect. Yum!

These were the rave of my scrapbook party.  Everyone wanted to bring some home to their husbands. One lady ate 4 and requested the recipe! I used a cream cheese frosting versus chocolate, other than using mini chips, I followed the recipe exactly. I was able to make 22 cupcakes out of this recipe.

The taste of these are amazing!  We did chocolate with the plain filling recipe.  Then we made yellow and added coloring and cherry flavor to the leftover filling (therefore we had definite excess filling).  My only problems were that first- more filling would make these out of this world but would be nearly impossible without oozing out of the cupcake.  Second- the filling on the chocolate ones did not stay in one spot!  It creeped up the sides and made a weird swirl design, so they really didn't look filled.  Initially I was expecting more of a true dollop of filling.  We'll definitely give these another try though.

Not really what I expected.  I followed this recipe to the "t" but the filling was incredibly runny!  I cant begin to think what I did differrently because as far as I know, I did everything perfectly!  It got runny once I added the egg, so I think next time I will leave that out and see what happens.  I had a lot of "filling" mixture left, as I read in some other reviews.  I may try these again, just to see what I can do differently.

Everyone loved these at the family bar-b-que. I used fat free cream cheese and milk chocolate chips. I used the suggestion of filling cupcakes 1/2 full, not 2/3, before adding cream cheese mixture. I iced with canned chocolate frosting and left covered in the fridge overnight.  Next time I will add coconut to the creamed mixture.

These were a hit with my family-especially my 3yr old who asked for a cupcake at every meal (no, she didn't get her way, but did eat her fair share) Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the suggestions by one reviewer to use 1/4 for the bottom layer and fill up to 2/3. It worked. I got 24 muffins, they didn't get so big, but were yummy and soft inside. If you want them bigger, than I would fill 20-22 cups. I did not use paper liners, and it was ok. I greased the bottom of the pan first, made the cream cheese mix, turned up the heat, and then did the batter. That way the batter won't have to wait for a long time while you make the cream.

The best twist/favour you could give/do to any cupcake: give it a choclate-cheesey interior.  I have only heard LOTS of praises for these ones, -record numbers of re-requests and they ALWAYS taste amazing.  It's a flavour ecstasy with these in your mouth and they're well worth the effort - this is now my standard cupcake recipe.  Some tips though: (i) follow this recipe to the dot; (ii) let the cupcakes cool in a refrigerator overnight so that the choclate chips harden and you get the 'bite'... flavour is also a world apart once they're chilled and; (c) these go well with frosting.  Some tried-and-very-successful suggestions: Betty Crockers chocolate spread with chocolate sprinkles OR Betty Crockers French Vanilla with rainbow sugar sprinkles.  A definite *****

I just tried this recipe tonight.  And it turned out great!!  Although I accidentally put a little less filling in them and had some filling left over, it went great!  I decided to try to bake the leftover filling in other cupcake cups.  I figure I had nothing to loose, and even that turned out great!  I didn't even bother to frost them and they are great. My husband loved it, my kids loved it.  Thanks alot! I will DEFINATELY use this again!
