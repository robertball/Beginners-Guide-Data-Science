I made this on top of the stove rather than in a crock pot because I didn't think there was any benefit to slow cooking (other than if you're going to be gone, having it ready when you arrive back home, and I was at home today).  I used small new red potatoes, so I didn't bother to peel them, and threw in a handful of peas that were in the freezer.  I think this is one of those recipes that you need to adjust the seasoning to your own taste preference, and that's what I did.  I scaled this down to 2 servings, but it easily could have served 3. Served this over egg noodles, and this simply is good, old-fashioned comfort food at its best.

This was very easy to make.  I didn't have potatoes so I added egg noodles per other reviews.  I also did not have time to stick in the crockpot so I cooked over the stove.  Everything was done within 45 minutes or so.

I wanted to try something new with ground beef and found this simple recipe for which I had all the ingredients.  I also wanted to have time for my grandson and not be busy cooking.  I served this with a salad and everyone loved it. My husband was particularly complimentary.

I made this in my slow cooker as directed and unfortunately it did not turn out good at all.  I tried to doctor up the flavor but my husband said it still did not taste good.  Not intending to offend the contributor or the other 3 reviewers but want to warn others before using good ingredients and having to scramble for a replacement meal like we had to.

If you do not have potatoes, you could put over noodles.  This was really good and I had all the ingredients on hand. The family loved it.  I prepare in cast iron pot as opposed to crock pot.  I did not have red bell pepper; therefore, I used green bell pepper.

I've made this recipe 4 times now and I rated 5 stars even though I have made some changes.  As in a previous review, I have prepared this as stovetop and not in the slow cooker.  I was looking for a recipe to duplicate what my husband described his Scottish Mother's recipe of 'stovies' and have kept all of the ingredients but have added mushrooms.   He and I both love this.

It is a very easy recipe. I used this recipe as a base than basically did my own thing. I cooked the ground beef and onions and peppers in the crockpot on high and than added spices and herbs while it was cooking than i added beef consumme instead of broth. Than i added sweet potato and baked potato and spinach.  The recipe flavoring is kind of weak for my taste so i added more. Otherwise it’s a great dish and can be served as is or on rice or veggies or noodles, whatever you prefer.

My family loved it. I did make it on the stove because I wanted to make it that day and couldn’t make it to the store until later. For my husband I made some penne pasta and put it on top of that. My son and I just ate it as is. I bought a good crusty bread to go with and made salads.

Stuck to the recipe but had to thicken it a bit because it was too runny. Added Siracha to give it some heat, and because I added more meat than required, I had to season it a bit to boost taste... but it turned out really well. Served it over brown rice, with a bun, topped with a dollup of Greek yogurt.

I didn't get it.  It seemed like too much ground beef compared to the rest of the ingredients to be eaten in a bowl like chili or stew, but also seemed weird to just have on it own.  I decided to serve it over a piece of bread which soaked up the juices and still tasted alright.  Would probably be good over hawaiian sweet bread. My family ate it and liked it okay but said they wouldn't want to do it again.

This was pretty tasty.  I cooked it on the stove as I was in a hurry, didn’t seem to hurt it.  Used potatoes and served over egg noodles.

I left out the ketchup and bell pepper. Instead of using chopped onions I added dry onion soup and 2 cups of water.**update, next time i think i will try using beef consomme instead of broth. It was kind of bland so i doused it with garlic powder and hamburger grill mates seasoning.

This is a very tasty dish except it was soupy instead of having a thicker sauce. Need to experiment with ways to thicken it up a bit.  Taste was great.  Next time I would use pasta spirals instead of potatoes.

Very tasty. I made it for my husband and children. It had nice flavor and we put it over egg noodles. I did thicken it as some reviews said and I made it on the stove as I didn't the time for the slow cooker. Very nice meal.

I rarely rate recipes because I tend to change them before cooking.  This time I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I found it to be a touch too sweet and soupy.  I did enjoy the combination of flavors and ingredients.  Next time I will cut back on the ketchup and thicken it up a bit.  Thank you for new recipe in my rotation!

Made this tonight...used recipie as is, just adapted to my method of cooking tools. (electric roaster)
I used 4 cans beef broth to cover larger area I was cooking, pretty much I doulbled every ingredient other than the meat.
 Right away I discovered a new scent from the food.  I addeded about a half cup corn starch/water to thickin up the sauce, once I did that, the sauce was perfect.
I added 2 extra potatoes quartered...and still made rotini pasta just before all dente...added to the mix in my roaster for bout 20 mins.
once I dished out a helping with some Texas toast....flavor was awesome, totally new taste...
5 star rating due to the base ingredients.... I have a set  "menu" of dishes I normally make, the flavor here was totally different, although I increased nearly all ingredients by 2....it was the original combination of the authors ingredients that still formed this unique taste for me. I only increased them to fill my own flavor desire.
This will be added to my culinary arsenal for sure.

I made this tonight, but changed things a bit. I left out the peppers, since I didn’t have any on hand. I also used sweet potatoes since I did have those on hand. I also cooked it all in my InstaPot since I wanted it done quickly. I first sautéed the onions and meat in the InstaPot. I then added the rest of the ingredients minus the peppers and the hot sauce since half of my family can’t handle spicy foods, but was a bit heavy handed with the paprika, which was great. I had some Cholula on the table for the other half of us that do like some heat. I did also add a couple sprigs of fresh thyme since I had some handy. After adding the rest of the ingredients, I turned the InstaPot to manual and put it for 15 minutes. When it was done, I used the quick release method, because we were hungry. It turned out amazing!! Hubby had three servings. Kids also had at least seconds as did I. Hubby said it was better than restaurant food. We ate it like a stew. Kids dipped sweet Hawaiian rolls and one added soup croutons. Great one pot meal!!

Simple recipe and I thought the taste was alright. I made it exactly to the recipe except I cooked on High for 4 hours in the slow cooker. Hard vegetables just don't get as tender when on low.

This was very simple, and satisfying. Just the right meal for a cold winter night. We served it with a loaf of crusty bread.

I made this with a few changes, and it was delicious. One of those dishes that is even better the next day. I only had beef bouillon, so I added that to about 2 c of water.  I added about 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of pepper. I didn't have tobasco or paprika, so I tried about 1/2 c of BBQ sauce, I still used the other called for ingredients.  At the end, it was more of a soup consistency, so I added about 1 1/2 c of elbow macaroni noodles. It turned of very good, and it will become one of our regular dishes.

I am rating this for what it is, a one-pot, ground beef meal. Excellent! Way better and more flavorful that you would expect. Used Sriracha sauce for the hot sauce.

Nice inexpensive recipe. I added a little bit of my beef bouillon paste to the hamburger as I was browning it to give it flavor, along with pepper and a couple sprinkles of garlic powder. I didn’t add any salt because my bouillon has plenty already. I would make again and will most likely make for one of our weekly meals with friends.

Delicious flavour!  I used my instant pot.  Sautéed the meat, added the onions, chopped garlic, and spices.  Mixed the beef broth 2 1/2 C with the ketchup, 2tbsp tomato paste, and spices. Added the carrots, potatoes and the liquid.  High pressure for15 minutes and quick released the pressure.  Added 3/4 c elbow whole wheat pasta that was just under cooked.  And let it sit on warm for about 5 minutes.
