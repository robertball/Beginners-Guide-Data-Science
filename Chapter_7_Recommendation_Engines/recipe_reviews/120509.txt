I made this for a baby shower brunch and it was definitely a hit.  It was a great choice because it wasn't too sweet.  After my guests left and the stress of the shower was over, I mixed a little of it with Malibu rum.  Mmmmm...

Just what I was looking for to serve at a recent brunch at my house. Everyone loved it, a big hit. I will serve it next time over crushed ice or ice cubes. Delicious and not too sweet.

Made this for a baby shower brunch and it was the perfect breakfast-time beverage.  I made it ahead of time, funneled it back into the large juice containers and when I was ready to set up for the party, I put an ice ring in the punch bowl and poured the ready-made punch inside.  Great recipe!

I doubled the batch, and my group of only 7 people consumed almost all of it! That's how good it is!

While I, personally, wouldn't have given this five stars, I'm basing my rating on how quickly it went at a recent brunch.  I would recommend doubling or tripling the recipe, especially if there are kids in attendance - they LOVED it!  Ours was more murky looking and less colorfully-appealing than the picture but tasted great all the same.

I gave this 4 out of 5 starts because as written my husband and I thought it was too acidic and sour.  To make it to our liking, we eliminated the lemon juice and added some lemon-lime soda to make it bubbly.  The almond extract is really delicious with the pineapple flavor.  It's a great starter recipe that can be customized to your taste!  I made this punch for 100+ people for a memorial service...I premixed the juices and made a simple syrup (equal amounts of sugar and water, brought to a boil and cooled) as the sweetener.  When we got to the church we just poured the juice mixture into the punch bowl and added the appropriate amount of simple syrup, almond extract, and topped it off with enough soda to make it sufficiently bubbly.  Everyone loved it, very refreshing. Add a little rum and you get a wonderful rum punch.  Thanks for sharing Edie!

This is a great punch!  I needed a quick & easy punch for an annual 4th of July brunch and this worked extremely well.  Everyone drank this over the OJ that was served.  It has great taste!  I left out the almond extract, only because I am not fond of almond flavor, but you could not tell and it tasted great!
