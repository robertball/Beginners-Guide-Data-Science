Fabulous - and a great way to dress up regular 'ol tuna salad! I did cut back on the pesto a bit and added some minced garlic. I made a wrap sandwich out of this and added some roasted red pepper and crisp romaine lettuce. Perfect with a side of cherry peppers. Thanks DC Girly Girl for another great recipe!

Hats off to the creator of this, girl you ROCK!!!  I am not even a fan of tuna, but this was fabulous.  I served on little garlic parmesan italian toast, and it was to die for. I can't wait to try it with pasta!  Thanks again!
Oh, I nearly forgot, I did add some pine nuts, cause I love them, and cut back on the mayo. DIVINE!!

This recipe is phenomenal! I will never eat tuna the old boring way again. The only thing I did differently was add a small crushed garlic clove (I neeeeeed garlic in everything!) and it was perfection!

This is the BEST tuna salad I've ever had. I made it exactly as listed and had with a mutli-grain baguette for a nice work lunch. It would also be great mixed with some crunchy veggies and pasta for a salad. Wonderful!

Delicious! I ended up turning this into a pasta salad (adding in whole wheat rotini) when some guests came over, and there was nothing left in the bowl afterwards! Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.

I love tuna but make the worst tuna salad. Not anymore! The pesto+sun-dried tomato combination is perfect! Thanks!

Great new way of doing tuna! I too was left with half a jar of pesto and leftover sun dried tomatoes... funny how that seems to be the case. :) I too added garlic like one of your reviewers. I had it toasted with a bit of cheddar cheese as well. Gorgeous!

I think of this recipe as a gift from above.  Thank you.  Like others have said, it is quick and easy to make with excellent results.  I loved it.  I think you could have probably used less pesto, but for me, it was great.  I even through in some jalapenos for some "pow".

This recipe is no short of fantastic. It is super fast to make and very rich in taste. It will go both for lunch or for a light dinner. I have combined it both with baguette and with pasta and it works out great with either one.

Enjoy!

WOW! This is just freaking awesome. My husband was sick and wanted to avoid dairy products and such. I had all the ingredients already (and that pesky pesto needed to get USED!) He passed by and tasted the tuna salad as I was making it, and was TOTALLY taken aback by how awesome it tasted. I was too.  I had almost exactly 1/4 cup of pesto left, and I actually used 12oz of tuna, therefore doubled the sundried tomatoes. It tasted fine, despite the lack of extra pesto.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

I was very excited to try this recipe when I first saw it, but I found the tuna a bit strange with the rest of the ingredients. In my opinion, I think chicken would be much better in this recipe and I will definitely try this again with chicken instead of tuna. Don't get me wrong, I love tuna salad. I eat it as a sandwich at least once a week and, obviously, there are reviewer whom really like this with tuna. I, unfortunately, am not one of them.

Love this recipe. Thank u for sharing it. Made 3 batches after the first one was tasted. I made some changes though, added 1 red onion and a teaspoon of garlic powder. Used only a tablespoon of mayonaise.

"It wasn't a total waist." That was my husbands response. My kids, who love tuna - "ick" and even I couldn't get over the overwhelming pesto taste just from a finger dipping. We made a fresh batch of our traditional tuna salad rather than eat this.

Pretty darn tasty! I added roasted red peppers and garlic to the mix, and served on artisan bread with a slice of a nice white cheese, lettuce and tomato. It looks (and tastes) like something from a fancy cafe!

This was extremely good!  I put this on bread that had whole cloves of garlic baked in it.  I also added a clove of minced garlic to the recipe. I made my own pesto using the Pesto recipe from this sight.  Trader Joe's is a great source for basil, either fresh or the whole plant.   This tuna recipe is a new favorite!

Ok...I did this recipe with cooked shrimp that I bought from Walmart.  I'm low carbing and was looking for something different to do with the shrimp.  Followed the recipe otherwise except I added some Old Bay Seasoning.  DELICIOUS!!!  But then I went stupid and added some relish.  DUMB CHOICE.  It's still decent but I should have stopped while I was ahead.   If you use shrimp instead of tuna...remember this isn't tuna salad and leave well enough alone.     Lesson learned...  I will make this again next week and follow directions.    Hint: Buy pesto ($2.50) and sun-dried ($1.15) tomatoes from Central Market bulk area.  It's soooo much cheaper but the quality is still amazing.  Update: I just made this recipe again but went by the recipe but with shrimp that I chopped up(manually) and it taste great.  I still added a dash of Old Bay which gave it a kick.  The only thing missing is a little citrus zing.  I didn't have any lemon or lime but I think that would have added the perfect touch.  Although I love it with the shrimp I'm still a little scared to try it with the tuna. Which is weird because I'm usually open to try all types of new things and I know it's less expensive than shrimp. I'm sure I'll try it with tuna eventually.  Thanks for the great recipes!

Who would've thought the jarred and canned stuff in my fridge and pantry could come together to make such amazing tasting tuna salad? Not me. Next time I'll double it. I could eat this two..three times a week.

This was a nice change from the usual tuna but I wasn't thrilled about the pesto taste. I liked it and may use less pesto next time. The sundried tomatoes were really nice in the tuna.

Sadly you can tell this recipe has been around for a while. Tuna no longer comes in 6 oz cans. :( Everything is smaller and costs more these days. Sounds delish and I have everything in my pantry to make this.

wow. really, really good. I was a little timid to try it out b/c it sounded so weird, but it's VERY VERY good. I lessened the ingredients quite a bit (except for tuna & tomatoes) , b/c it was a little much for a little can of tuna. It is yummy though! thanks!

I am rating this 4 stars because it's way too much pesto as most other reviewers have noted.  I used half the pesto and served this on toasted ciabatta.  Oh my goodness, this is a gourmet sandwich!  Delicious!!  Even my husband (who *hates* tuna) finished his sandwich and went back for seconds.  I recommend the "Pesto Sauce" recipe from this site to use in this yummy sandwich.

Really, really wonderful and excitingly new! I've never tasted anything like it. I actually used three cans of tuna, stuck to the 1/4 cup pesto (just regular, I didn't have basil pesto), threw in an extra tomato or so and used probably just 1 Tbsp mayo, eyeballing the quantities. I put it in a warm pita for a scrumptiously light dinner.

Wow!  What a way to mix up the plain old Tuna Sandwich.  I did not have sun dried tomatoes so I used some sweet roasted red peppers instead and it was great!  I make a tuna melt with fontina cheese.  Yummy!

Interesting combination of flavors.  Different from the usual tuna salad.  Only used 2T. of pesto/sun-dried tomatoes (as I think 1/4c. would of been too much).  This would make a good addition for a finger sandwich assortment for a bridal/baby shower.

Attempted to make this for lunch tomorrow and just ate it all, lol.  Wanted it super low carb and low cal, so I used 4 oz of fresh tuna (broiled), 3 tsp of low fat mayo, several leaves of fresh basil & garlic powder.  Instead of jarred pesto w/oil I used 1 tsp. dry pesto powder w/water.  Yum-o!  Remaking now for lunch. :p

Excellent!  My husband & I both loved this!  I started out decreasing the pesto, but ended up adding the whole amount - it is delicious, both on multigrain bread & wheat crackers!  I did add about 1.5 tsp minced garlic.  I can't say enough how great this is, definately deserving of 5 stars!

I made it exactly as described. It was really good. Next time I will use less sundried tomatoes and pesto and add roasted red peppers. We ate it with garlic toast and although I loved it my husband thought it was overpowering. I would definitely recommend this recipe for tuna salad. This is a very unique flavor. I also want to try the exact same ingredients but instead of tuna I would add chicken.

I followed the recipe loosely with delicious results. I didn't have pesto but did have fresh basil so I used that instead. I also added a bit of mustard and chopped onion. Very good on paninis! I might try adding a little lemon juice next time too.

Super delish and versatile.  Sandwich, wrap, or a pretty scoop in a bed of greens.  My kids thought this was tolerable (which is high praise from them).  And I thought that it tasted even better the second day.  I am definitely adding this into the rotation.

Update:  Kids actually request this now.

This was just okay for me.  I used a 12 oz can of tuna with as much dressing as this recipe called for and it was plenty moist for my taste.  I had to doctor it up a bit to get some flavor going.  I addded some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt and black pepper.  Served on Italian roll with tomatoes and lettuce.  Nice for something different.

Really good twist to an old classic!  I like tuna and trying new things with this, and this has good versatility.  Whether on a sandwich or a bed of lettuce, this is a tasty version that is almost sure to please anyone that likes tuna!

I made this for a family get-together in Prior Lake, MN. If you like tuna salad sandwiches you will love this unique mixture. One comment was that it was a bit too oily, but that could be remedied by using water-packed tuna, rather than oil-packed tuna.

Great idea with the pesto and sundried tomatoes.  I followed the recipe accordingly and added a dash of curry powder, pinch of red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper, and parsley flakes.  I love spice in my dishes.  I added some egg noodles to make it a pasta salad, chilled it, and served with hot garlic bread when we were ready to eat.

Yum!  Great alternative from the norm.  I actually made a tuna melt with it.  I used a french bread, buttered the sides, placed this mixture along with goat cheese on the bread and slightly browned both sides over medium heat... It was fantastic!

For rating purposes, I like to make it exactly by the recipe that is given.  However, the tuna was just too mushy.  For 4 servings, I added an additional can of tuna to thicken it up.  This dish was amazing!  It was the perfect combination of tuna and pesto.  I can't wait for my leftovers for lunch today.  If you're looking to turn it into a sandwich, try a croissant with a few leaves of spinach.

This is an excellant recipe! It is every bit as good as the previous reviewers said. I would not change a thing. I found a recipe for basil pesto on this site and the next time I think I will try making my own. Store brands are expensive and I thing I will be making this recipe alot. Thanks, The Peev

This is very good.  Three pieces of pesto frozen in ice cube trays makes the 1/4 cup of pesto you need.  I used dried sun-dried tomatoes that I chopped fine and rehydrated with hot water.  Added some snipped chive for something fresh.  Wonderful - will make again.

This recipe is full of lean protein, healthy fats, and rich delicious-ness.  So, so good.  If you use commercially prepared pesto, be sure to check for hydrogenated oils. Good brands will just have extra virgin olive oil.

Pretty good.  Definitely a change from the traditional tuna salad.  I used sun-dried tomato pesto and I made mini sandwiches (cut off the bread ends and cut the sandwich into 4's).  Great as a sampler item!

This is a great way to change a regular ol' tuna sandwich. I added extra sun-dried tomatoes and a little chopped fresh basil. Very good, especially for those tho aren't fans of tuna to begin with.

Not bad, but I'm a first time pesto and sun dried tomato user.  The fishy taste from the tuna is gone, that's a plus.  It is quite interesting.  I had it with triscuits.  I'd probably make it again.

I made this first with tuna and liked it.  Then I made it with chicken and loved it!  I served it on some toasted Alpine Valley Super Grains bread (any good multi-grain bread would work with some crisp iceberg lettuce.  Just awesome!  Thank you for a creative new way to look at tuna/chicken salad!

An absolutely delightful update for a Tuna Salad.  I also added  small amounts of chopped red and green peppers for color and crunch.  I used  less mayonnaise and made sure it was Light Hellmans.

This recipe is good. I will make it again. I made wraps with it and added a few slices of avocado and cucumber for a refreshing light summer dinner. I don't think this needs anything else other than praise! Is fast, easy, light, and tasty. Maybe next time I will make it again a day in advance to let flavors to develop and prepare the wraps for a quick lunch or dinner the next day.

Love the base of the recipe, but I like a little crunch. So I added slivered almonds once and sunflower seeds another time. If you like things a little sweeter, swap out the sun dried tomatoes for dried cranberries! I will be having this frequently!!

Don't be afraid to experiment with tuna salad.  Almost everything is good in tuna salad.  I never ever eat it plain.  This is a very good base recipe. I have been trying different ingredients for a long time.  I have used these ingredients but also use garlic, roasted red peppers fresh chives, parsley and basil from my herb garden.  Like some crunchy veggies too - red onion, celery, cucumbers, little bit of jalapeño, sweet peppers in the jar.  And for a kick try buffalo sauce.  Awesome! I put the salad on ciabatta and top with any kind of cheeses you like and sometimes fresh basil leaves - broil until melted and you have a fantastic light dinner.

Delicious ~ I also had a half jar of oil packed sun dried tomatoes in the refrigerator, along with just about 1/4 cup pesto in a small jar so this recipe was a perfect one for me.   I followed the recipe as written, I will definitely make it again.

This was really good! I did not have any tomatoes the recipe called for on hand but it was still good without.  I had mine in a wrap with Romaine and thinly sliced pieces of hard boiled egg.

Probably the healthiest tuna sandwich I've ever had. Made Pesto from AR. Also added spinach and leftover sprouts (various kinds). I really liked the pesto part of the sandwich and it gave a nice twist to same old tuna sandwiches.

I think it's all in technique & using white albacore canned tuna which makes a difference. I added the fresh minced garlic, shredded the tuna by hand before adding to the wet ingredients, llowed to marinade for at least 5 minutes in the fridge. Made sure my freshly cooked loose pasta was cold before adding the tuna salad mixture, finished off flavored herbed olive oil in case the some pasta parts were dried out. Definitely will make again.

I hate cooking and didn't want to order food, so I decided to come to this website and find simple recipes and to my surprise I found this recipe that matched the only food I found in my pantry/fridge  tuna cans, pesto and sun-dried tomatoes, I decided to try it and it turned out to be delicious, I loved it, this is a great idea without having to spend $$ in restaurants.

What a great twist on the traditional tuna salad! But, USE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT! Add pesto, mayo, & parm to taste! (Some like more mayo, pesto, etc.) Overall, fabulous use of ingredients I already had on hand.

I loved this recipe, and you have to believe me when I say I hate canned tuna in all its forms. I was just looking for a semi healthy lunch I could choke down during my kid's nap time, thinking I could hide it with bread and lettuce and other filler but instead I got a tasty snack on wheat thins with absolutely nothing hiding the awesome. 

If my toddler likes this as an after nap snack I need to cheat the system and find a way to rate this a bajillion stars.

Mmmm! Took some others suggestions and added some minced garlic and cut back a little on the pesto. Put it on toast and sprinkled on some mozzarella cheese and microwaved for 30 secs. Delicious! Definitely added some great flavors to a simple tuna melt!

WOW! This is probably the best tuna salad alternative I've ever made. In fact, the pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and parmesan may actually be superior ingredients for tuna salad than the traditional mayo recipe. I served hors d'oeuvres featuring this recipe at a party, and it was clearly the most popular offering, with guests asking for the recipe.....DC Girly: GREAT JOB! I love it when a fabulous recipe is discovered using non-traditional ingredients :)

Loved this recipe and it was super easy. I served this with Club crackers. My husband wasn't fond of it, but my sister and her boyfriend loved it as well. And since it is so easy it was worth a try...will make it again.

This recipe is SO good!  I made this with homemade pesto with basil from my garden.  When making it, I realized I was out of sun-dried tomatoes so I substituted chopped roasted red peppers.  It was amazing!  Even my picky kids loved it!  Can't wait to make this recipe w/the sun-dried tomatoes next time.  Thank you so much for sharing.  This will be my favorite tuna salad recipe from now on.

CD Girly Girl needs to get bored more often.  I WISH I was that successfully creative with my rainy day creations.  This was sooo tasty.  
Great job with this add.

Great idea! I didn't have any fresh basil or pesto so I used 1 Tbs dry basil, 1 clove garlic, some grated parm and a little olive oil and made my own. Not as good as real pesto with fresh basil and pine nuts but definitely did the trick.

OMG- This is sooo good! I made it without the pesto just because I did not have any, and used miracle whip instead of mayo for less fat. I think this will be they way I prepare Tuna Salad from now on.

I love tuna and this was a great alternative to the plain old mix.  I had to "dilute" the pesto though because it was a bit strong by adding another can of tuna (maybe the brand I bought).  also because of this, I had to add more mayo but can you have too much of that??!!!

Very tasty. I used lite mayo and may try less pesto next time to decrease the fat content but really takes tuna to another level. Used on the Orowheat Multi-grain sandwich thins.

This recipe is amazing and so simple! My fiance also loves and requests this for lunch.  It packs up really well and can be eaten with Triscuits.  I cut some of the fat by using less mayo and a little bit of olive oil. Thanks for a great recipe. :)

Great alternative to the traditional method. I took it a few steps further and added chopped artichoke hearts and kalamata olives since I had them on-hand. I also sprinkled some red chili flakes for a little zip and used lowfat plain yogurt instead of mayo (figured I dumped enough oil in it!). Quite nice!

I am a big fan of both pesto and sun dried tomato so this recipe seemed like a sure thing but the end result was terrible. Way too much pesto. I threw out the sandwich after the first bite. Trust me when i recommend cutting way back on the pesto unless you want a pesto sandwich

I am a big fan of tuna, in fact I love it!! I also love pesto.  Having said that, this is such a fun variation on tuna salad!! I love the flavor combination. I used homemade pesto that I thawed from the freezer and a 6.4 oz. pouch rather than a can of tuna. Other than that I didn't change anything.  The more pesto the bettter in my opinion!!!

For picky eaters in my family I used less than half of the pesto/sundried tomatoe combination.  I personally think this recipe was great!  Picky eaters were no so impressed.  I used fresh bakery bread lightly toasted with melted Muenster cheese!

Super yummy!   I wanted to try this recipe badly, but didn't have pesto or basil around the house.  I did have a bunch of cilantro and pine nuts, so I made up a batch of cilantro pesto.  I also didn't have sun-dried tomatoes in oil, so I took my dry ones and chopped them in the food processor along with the pesto and added a bit more evoo to moisten them up.  Last night I made some chipotle mayo dip for tostones, so I added that in place of the regular mayo and put in a couple of fire roasted red peppers to the tuna mix.  I wish I had an avocado to top with the filling, but I'm eating it with pasta this time.    YUMM!  This is a winner!!  Will definitely make again.

Wow - great recipe!!  I made it tonight for a quick dinner.  Didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, so I skipped those and added red onion, sunflower seeds, and dried berries.  We scooped it onto crackers, and I served a salad with it.  I was hoping for leftovers...but we ate it up!  I'll be making this again for sure!!

Wow, this was really delicious.  I was almost afraid to taste it because I am pretty funny about what I eat fish with--I was pleasantly surprised, it was fantastic! I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 tsp. of garlic and only used 6 sundried tomato halves, which was plenty for me.  I served it on toasted wheat bread with provolone cheese and some spring mix lettuce--very tasty!! My husband LOVED it.

Wow... This was AMAZING.  So incredibly delicious and fresh tasting.  I did only use 1 tablespoon of mayo (miracle whip actually) and 2 tablespoons of pesto.  Then I refrigerated it for a while and mixed it all with some chopped spinach.  Doesn't even taste like tuna at all!  I'll definitely be making it again and again.

I like tuna salad, I love Pesto and sun-dried tomatoes, but this one really didn't work for me or my husband. 

I made the Pesto myself (don't like store bought ones in this country). At least I could use what was left of the Pesto for a pasta dish... not one to repeat

Delicious way to eat canned tuna! Though, instead of one 6-ounce can of tuna, I used two 5-ounce cans, and it turned out fine. I think the original recipe may have been too heavy on the condiments and too light on the tuna. But, with modification, it was awesome. Great with lettuce and tomato on wheat!

I left out the tomatoes because I didn't have any. The pesto went really well with the tuna. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my best friend's baby shower and it was a hit! Some of the guests thought the food was catered, which is always a nice compliment! This is the best tuna salad I have ever tasted. The pesto sauce in combo w/ the sun dried tomatoes makes it so very unique. I have never been a fan of your "normal" tuna salad; this brings a whole new meaning. The ingredients are pricey but well worth it; fantastic!

Excellent for Non-Fish Lovers-- Taste of fish is completely masked with pesto and tomato-- To save some work, I pureed my sun-dried tomatoes and it "tricked" my kids into eating it without compromising the SD Tomato taste.

Exellent Recipe!!

Over-all it was a nice recipe, but it was quite dry.  I'd recommend adding a bit more mayonnaise if you've thoroughly drained your tuna.  I put mine in some pita bread with lettuce and black olives, and it really made this recipe.

I used sun-dried tomato pesto, and started with 2T and found it to be enough.  This is *so* good!  Thanks for livening up my tuna sandwich!

Loved this recipe!! I'm also a low carber so was looking for something that was good enough to eat on it's own and this rocks!! I had a few extra ingredients lying around so I added some chopped celery, lemon juice, chopped fresh parsley, olives, chopped hazlenuts, and mixed seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame and pine nuts). It added extra crunchiness and was sooo yummy! I also halved the pesto and mayo amounts and didn't have any parmesan but it still turned out GREAT! Thanks so much! I'll be making this all the time now, yaay : )

Really good!  This would be a great way to serve tuna at a party (with some crackers or such).  I added some crushed toasted almonds and chopped celery for some added crunch.

Very, very good--a bit salty on its own from the tomatoes and pesto, but I'm boiling noodles right now for a small pasta salad! I adapted the recipe to what I had on hand: same amount of pesto and mayo, double the parmesan and sun-dried tomatoes, and a 7-ounce package of tuna (the kind without water/oil... supposedly equivalent to two 6-ounce cans). This is a great salad!

I doubled the recipe to serve more and still ended up using an extra 3ozs of tuna.  So the ratios seem a little off, so experiment.  Overall though, the flavor was AMAZING!  We had it both on bread and with pasta.  Great both ways.

I am always looking for ways to serve tuna since we always have a can or two in the pantry.  This is excellent -- but I did use my own homemade pesto. We will definitely make this again!

Yum... I also used low fat stuff and dried tomatoes instead of oil packed.  

We served it on toast with tomato soup!  It was REALLY good!!!!

We actually make a large batch of this using an entire container of pesto and 5 cans of tuna - then freeze it and pull it out when we want it.  This is a REGULAR in our house.  This is that one recipe that we are so thankful for!  Trying 100 recipes to get this one was well worth it!

Fantastic!  We love this recipe.  We made sandwiches on a baguette.  I used mostly reduced fat ingredients (dried tomatoes insted of oil packed etc.) and it turned out great.  With such an odd combination of ingredients I was surprised how good it was.  Next time we'll try tuna melts with some mozzarella.

Now THIS is interesting!!! If I didn't make it myself, I wouldn't have guessed I was eating a tuna sandwich. The flavors really come together to make an entirely different taste. I used fresh pesto and minced the sundried tomatoes. ALSO, I made a tuna pasta salad w/ this and it is highly recommended!!!!!!

Terrific!  I actaully made this with dry packed sun-dried tomatoes and just let them marinade over night.  This worked out well.  I also served it over brown rice which was also tastey.  I will definetely make this again.

Awful. I followed the recipe verbatim and it came out tasting like corrugated packaging. When I realized how bad the recipe is, I added 1 Tbsp. of balsamic vinegar and a Tbsp. of more olive oil. I certainly will never make this mistake again.

This was amazing!! I absolutely loved this recipe, even more than I expected to. I didn't make any changes to the salad, and put it on some sliced wheat bread with some fresh tomato and sharp cheddar to make some open-faced tuna melts in my oven. I will absolutely be making this again!

Use one can of tuna with one baguette.  Enough for two of us.  First time I used 2 cans and 2 baguettes but too much. Excellent sandwich.

I used an Italian parsley and almond pesto and miracle whip instead of mayonnaise.  It is very good!

Love this recipe.  Bought Sun Dried Tomato Bruschetta by mistake. Added two tablespoons instead of the plain sun dried tomatoes. The spices in the bruschetta really added a nice touch to the mixture. It's a definite keeper.

TASTY EASY We really enjoyed this for a different kind
of tuna sandwich. I was careful with the sundried and pesto thinking it might be very powerful. Not to worry, the balance was perfect. I made a wrap and added lettuce . Very nice.

I had a craving for tuna salad and made this recipe. I didn't care for it at all and the smell turned my husband's stomach. He wouldn't even try it. I had to toss it and make my usual tuna salad.

I love this tuna salad.  I was out of sun-dried tomatoes, so 
used the next best thing....tomato powder. (I had dehydrated 8 lbs tomatoes, ground them into dust in my Vitamix.  8 lbs of
tomatoes fit into a mason jar.)  I stirred about a teaspoon of tomato powder into the mayo with some minced garlic and red onion and proceeded with the recipe.  OMG, it's delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

Added a cut up Thai Dragon Tooth hot pepper and tried the mixture in sandwiches I was making.  Too many oil combinations with the mayonnaise, oil packed tomatoes, and pesto.

I normally make my tuna with tomato, onion, mushrooms and black olives then season with whatever sounds good at the time (Adobo, Italian seasoning,  Old Bay whatever) So I thought I would try this simpler version and I really like it! If I'm in a hurry I will try this again. I also do low carb so I eat this with pork rinds!! Give it a try!!

I think this recipe could be good, but there was waaay too much pesto in it. I couldn't even taste the tuna. I think cutting the pesto back by at least half would help. I wanted a tuna salad with subtle pesto flavor, but instead this was overwhelming. I think adding some lemon would be good too.

We are big Pesto lovers, so when I saw this recipe, I knew we had to try it. We loved this! I used Feta instead of all Parm, and we made sandwiches using a tomato herb bread, dressed with baby spinach, tomatoes and cukes. Think it would also make a great wrap... Delicious!

I omitted the sun dried tomatoes, and I used chicken thigh meat, for a super tender meat. I added pine nuts and onions! I only use the bread sometimes, when I want to be more carb conscience I just eat it by itself. Great base recipe!

I tried mixing this with rotini, as other reviewers had suggested, and was disappointed. It seemed bland to me, and I just didn't think that pesto and tuna went all that well together. The pesto I used, however, was a blend of spinach, basil, and parsley. Perhaps a strictly basil based pesto would have been better.

Very good.  I needed to get rid of some homemade pesto and was looking for something different.  My pesto was really solid, so I ended up using a bit more mayo than called for to moisten it up and b/c of that ended up using an extra can of tuna (10oz. total).  I had to hold myself back from eating it plain, so I can have it on a sandwich tomorrow!!

I thought the pesto was a little overpowering, next time I'll use a little less.  I think this is a tuna salad recipe for people who don't like tuna because we could barely taste it over the pesto.

FANTASTIC!  We found chopping up the sun dried tomatoes spread the flavor throughout the salad better. Also loved the suggestion to chop some jalapenos.

Great flavor. Especially nice if you like pesto. Really gives tuna salad a new kick! Thanks for sharing.

I was so skeptical of this mix of ingredients, but WOW!  Yum!  I used 1/2 the amount of pesto because it seemed like a lot, but it may be just as good with the recommended amount too.  Definitely a keeper.

I really enjoyed this except that I did leave out the sun dried tomatoes as I'm not really big on them. Made my own pesto and added in some chopped red onion. Delish and thank you!

Loved the basic recipe but made some changes. I cut the basil pesto in half and used trader joe's sun dried tomato bruschetta instead of the individual tomatoes. Like another reviewer I added all of this to whole wheat rotini and chilled for a tuna salad. This was a huge hit, thank again for the great recipe!

This is very good.  I love pesto and sun dried tomatoes, and I really like the combo.  The amounts are a bit off for me, though--I wouldn't use that much pesto or mayo.  Otherwise, delish and a wonderful idea.  thanks!

This was surprisingly yummy!! I love tuna, pesto and sun dried tomatoes but I wasn't sure if they'd be good together. It was delicious!! I didn't follow the recipe exactly and just added ingredients as I thought they were needed. I also add some garlic and fresh tomatoes to make this even tastier.

Absolutely delicious! A few changes: I substituted halved grape tomatoes for sundried tomatoes, cut back the pesto to 2 tbsp. and mayo to 1 tbsp., and added chopped parsley, chopped dill pickles, and lemon juice. Sandwiched in a french baguette, its become one of my favorite sandwiches!

This was fast & unique. I followed the recipe except I used 1 tablespoon Miracle Whip and two/three tablespoons of prepared pesto in a jar. I usually make my own pesto but since I had the ready-made kind, this recipe was super fast to make. Thank you!

I dont know if it's just me or what.. this recipe got such great reviews - but I think i'ts just okay. It's a little on the weird side actually - I doubled the tuna b/c everyone seemed to say it was too much pesto, so I did 2 cans of tuna with the 1/4 c pesto and doubled the mayo (used miracle whip) and the parmesian. I didnt really like it, so I added about 1/8 more c of the pesto which was still less than the recipe called for if doubling - still not really great - added some garlic - still not there - then added more parmesan - it was better... but still - just okay. I can eat it, but i know my husband wont like it. At least it's healthy (used light m.w. and dried tomatoes instead of in oil) so it makes a decent "different" snack or light lunch.

Delicious, quick, and oh soo easy!  

I personally like my food a little spiced up, so I used one can of tuna in water and one can of tuna w/ chili in water (Catch & Harvest brand).  I omitted the sundried tomatoes and added only 1/4 C of pesto (although I doubled everything else).  

The tuna was wonderful spread over half of a bagel, toasted well and topped with craisens (sweetened dried cranberries). 

It's a keeper for sure!  Enjoy!

This was very good!  I liked the combination of flavors and it definitely jazzed up the typical tuna fish sandwich.  I think the amount of pesto for one can of tuna may be a bit much.  I used 2 cans of tuna with a 1/4 cup of pesto and it was plenty.

Remember when mama told you to "try everything once?"  Haha.. this recipe puts that to the test.  Everything about this recipe is horrible - except of course, the taste.  It looks bad on paper (I cringed when I first read it), it looks REALLY bad when mixed all together, and so the fact that I liked this so much I made a double recipe instantaneously should really speak to the fact that this stuff is great!    No changes neccessary for me.  Two slices of whole grain wheat bread and I was ready to go.

This is a really delicious and different dish!  Like other reviewers, I used sun-dried tomatoes that were not packed in oil (maybe that was why it seemed a little dry with the leftovers the next day, so I had to add another T of mayo).  Served it on small wheat rolls.  I like the idea of mixing it in with some rotini... I'll try that next time.

This recipe was very good. I like pesto alot, and it added a great flavor to the tuna fish. It wasn't fishy at all. I added an egg, and it was great. I will definitely make this again.

Very good. Very rich -- more like a dip than a sandwich filling. Followed recipe exactly -- even went out and bought sundried tomatoes and pesto for the first time in my life. I'd cut down on the pesto a little next time.

Our class enjoyed the new flavors (well, new to us) and staff from all over the building HAD to stop by to try some.I don't think we changed a thing! Our Nurse stole the recipe off the desk for an event that weekend, pretty good stuff by us.

I had a large piece of tuna steak leftover in the fridge---at the price I paid, I didn't want to throw it out so I tried this recipe. I served it on a bed of greens topped w/toasted pecans for a nice sweet crunch. My husband is not a fan of sun-dried tomatoes but the pesto really complimented it and he too enjoyed this recipe. I will make again! thanks for a tuna-alternative

This is a great recipe.  Everyone at lunched was so interested in what I was eating.  Like myself, they had never seen tuna prepared like this.  I don't think I'll ever go back to regular tuna. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is a great change from the regular Tuna Salad.  I love the new twist in flavor.

Halved the amount of pesto and mayo as others had suggested and tasted good.  Will add some chopped onions to it next time.

I was actually looking for a recipes to use this sun-dried tomato pesto I bought by classico.  I was thinking maybe chicken and pasta.  But I saw this and decided to add a tablespoon to some tuna I had already made.  It was excellent. I will be making my tuna salad with sun-dried tomato pesto from now on.
