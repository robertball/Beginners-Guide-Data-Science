I enjoyed your recipe.  It is definitely for those who want to satisfy their sweet tooth.  It is also good if shaken!

I used skim milk in place of the light cream to save on the fat and calories and it was great! I made it in a cocktail shaker and served it in a martini glass. Will definitely make it again. Thanks.

This was good. Just a little too sweet for me. This would be good added to hot coffee with a little whipped cream on top.

This is a nice dessert drink which my daughter thought was worth 4 stars, I thought it was 5 stars, but we both recommend it.  I loved it.
