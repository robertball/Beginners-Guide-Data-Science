These were fun to put together. They made a nice Sunday afternoon date for me and the hubster. He wanted donuts, but when we came across this recipe, well the name is kind of catch-ie!   The first couple came out looking like mutant eggs! So we kind of rolled them more oval and flattened them a little, since the hubster insisted they should look like beaver tails... We did the sugar and cinnamon, yum! But then we noticed the cook's note on the bottom and went savory and experimented. Also nice for a change in flavor. I'd love to try it with the maple spread, but alas. Hell even maple syrup here in France is pretty pricey and kind of a hunt to find. So we went with homemade jams, like apricot, strawberry and blackberries. The hubster went for the Nutella. We used a blue cheese/creme fraiche dip. That is some mighty fine chomping! Thanks for the recipe share! Tasty and fun.

These are delicious, and were enjoyed by everyone. Next time, I would use 2 eggs instead of 3 as I had to add quite a bit more flour. I should note that I used large eggs. I have also made them using 4 cups of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat. Some family members preferred them that way - just a matter of taste. Thanks for the recipe.

O.M.G. - I am from Albany, NY, and every year we would go to the Capital for the 4th of July e fireworks and would *always* get fried dough. Now that I live in Utah, you absolutely cannot get this *anywhere*. No one has ever heard of it. I found this recipe and tried today (July 4th) for the first time. My husband and kids were AMAZED. We all ate at least 4 pieces, covered in cinnamon and sugar and we all agreed it was BETTER than what you get from the 4th of July vendors.

My one change was this: we shaped the dough as the recipe said and found it was too thick to cook properly, so we shaped it into ovals and then smooshed it out with our hands until the pieces looked more like thick tortillas and they cooked up *perfectly*. It has instantly become our new go-to 4th of July tradition.

Love these pastries! Haven't made your recipe yet but can hardly wait! I'm a fan of the butter and cinnamon topping. Just a quick question. Have you ever frozen the remaining dough and then defrosted and made the "tail" at a later date? I gave you 5 stars as I know this is going to be awesome!

I was so happy to find a fried dough/donut recipe with something healthier like wheat flour! Right off think I might try stevia instead of white sugar, and grape seed oil (ideal for deep frying-less money than olive oil, got at Costco) instead of vegetable oil.  A winning recipe from Canada-thanks!

Utterly the most amazing fried dough recipe I've ever come across. The variations I can do with the dough is endless. Like most I made my first batch as instructed and the outcome was amazing. Because there was such a large portion of dough from this recipe I divided it into 3 portions for experimentation. I rolled out the second portion and used a cookie cutter to cut out some shapes which I left to rest on a tray covered. The third batch I rolled out very thin (because of my brother whining of one he ate at carnivals), about half a cm and fried it as the original, sprinkled powder sugar and ready to go. It was crispier and less hollow. NOW! the most amazing, take the cookie cutted dough and fry those till golden brown (I did save it last to give it time to rise a bit about 30 mins), glazed, and powdered some. Instantly The most amazing doughnuts!! Better than Timhortons! Wasn't even looking for a doughnut recipe. My hubby loved them. Everything disappeared instantly. Highly recommended dough recipe over other. This is a sure keeper! I also tried with plain all-purpose flour for a wonderful lighter fluffier texture. Best eatten hot/warm! Note: I fried everything at 300-325 degrees.

Rolled them out like others suggested, but had a lot of trouble getting the sugar to stick. And no matter how thick they were rolled or the heat of the oil, these were extremely crispy. Just not my cup of tea...

This was fantastic. The kids loved rolling out the dough and of course, putting the toppings on later. Someone asked about freezing: I froze a few samples, they were great. Thaw at room temperature, pop in a 300 degree oven and when they are the desired temperature, remove (for us, this was just a few minutes). We set up a "toppings buffet" and served them with Nutella, our homemade jams, M&Ms, peanuts, trail mix: you get the idea. Our family loved that they each got their own, as when we go to the fair we buy it as a treat and share.

We are a Canadian family living overseas and my son had to do a home country presentation. He asked me to make beaver tails! Thankfully I found this recipe. They are awesome. Nice and thin. I used only whole wheat flour. I halved the recipe so 3 cups of flour and one egg. Turned out perfectly. Everyone loved them at school fantastic result.

They were really really good! I loved them! You can also put one chocolate spread on it, with some sprinkles of icing sugar on top like the shop! xD

If doing the traditional cinnamon sugar topping don't forget the fresh squeezed lemon on top.

When I deep fried this, it came out EXACTLY like a Rodent Appendage.  I tried "frying" it in an Actifry and it didn't work out.

These were delicious! I ended up making my dough (letting it rise) and then sectioning it into 3 balls, wrapping each in saran wrap and freezing them to make later. To defrost, I put them into the fridge the day before to thaw and rolled them out thin and fried them the following day. For toppings, we did nutella with m&m's, and, cinnamon and sugar. Next time I wll spread a little melted butter before sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar to make it stick better. Great recipe!

When I was a kid my Mom would tear off bits of the bread dough and fry them up for us.  We called them Dough Boys.  She use to sort of just pull them into shape and they would have holes in them in places. We had them with butter, cinnamon sugar or icing sugar.  Yummy

I love this recipe!   I used all purpose flour, and ended up adding about 1/2 or more extra flour when I was kneading it.   It rose beautifully and everyone loves them!

Love this recipe, they are absolutely delicious!! When my family heard I was making them, I had both my sisters over, my kids and in all honesty they all said they tasted better than the one we purchase from beavertails store. I made minor changes and used regular flower, as well as added 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract to get rid of the yeast smell, worked out great.

Living abroad it is always nice to be able to make something that can bring a little taste of home to us.  We made this for the Multi-cultural lunch at the children's school and they were a HUGE hit.  Thank you for the recipe and for making us the hit of the classroom!  Next time we will be sure to add a few different toppings.
