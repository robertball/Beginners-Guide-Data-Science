I love Chinese Chicken Salad!  I altered this recipe a bit and served it to a group of 30 people and it turned out fantastic.  
I added the following: 1 green pepper sliced; sliced mushrooms; two 11 ounce cans mandarin orange segments (juice drained); 1 small can rice noodles.  I also thought the dressing was way too spicey (hot) so I changed it too, which made the salad taste much better.  Dressing: 2 Tbsp white sugar, 2 Tbsp white vinegar, 3/4 Tbsp sesame oil, 3/4 tsp ground dry mustard, 3 Tbsp Teriyaki Sauce (I used Angostura brand which has less sodium than other brands).

Great salad!  Just a little too spicy for me - I will use half the dry mustard next time.  I also added a can of chopped water chestnuts.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this to be very good, only I left off the dressing that was given and instead added a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise, and served on bread like sandwiches.  Delicious!

This is the dressing recipe I've been searching forever for!  I also cut the mustard (heh heh) in half, but will add a touch more next time, just to see how that goes.
I served mine over ramen noodles, and added thinly sliced nappa/chinese cabbage to it.  I doubled the dressing recipe, drizzled it over the noodles, then the salad..layered them in single serving bowls, then kept the rest of the dressing on the side.
This is a really terrific salad on a hot day!

This was good tossed with Napa (Chinese) cabbage.  I also used it as a filling for the popular new "lettuce wraps."  It was very good.

The dressing really gives this salad an oriental flavor, however, the cilantro was slightly overpowering.  I also blanched the snap peas for a minute before adding to the mixture and they were still very crispy.  This is a nice, cool summer dish.

This was very yummy.  I substituted blanched asparagas for the snow peas because that's what I had on hand.   I will make it again!

Quite tasty. It's a nice summer dish. We enjoyed it, although I would add less sugar next time.  It was a little too sweet for me.

This salad mixture was great as a main meal.  The toasted almonds were well liked, and I used it over napa cabbage. Very filling and flavorful. I did double the dressing, due to the extra cabbage, alittle extra is better than not enough. Do cut the dry mustard by half if it's not your favorite flavor. I also omitted the cilantro leaves.  No Teriyaki Sauce on hand, use one submitted by Kevin, it was excellent!

Made this for dinner as it looked filling enough to serve alone.  As it was just the hubby and myself tonight, I dressed only half of the salad and saved half which I rarely do.  The dressing was a tad too sharp and the mustard was somewhat overwhelming. Second day I had the other half as a lettuce wrap for lunch and lo and behold, the dressing was GREAT. Apparently it needed a day for the flavors to marry. Thank you Linda W for the submission.

I personally liked this salad (which is more of a meal than a side dish) but the others in the household thought it was a bit too busy. Nice crunch. I added mandarin orange segments for a bit of moisture and sweetness and they were a nice addition.

very good -- lots of people loved it and it's flexible -- can be eaten on its own, as a side dish, in a pita, in a sandwich, with lettuce, etc. etc.

I completely agree with one of the earlier reviewers, and I wished I'd taken their advice! :) I prepared this for dinner recently and ate it right away. My husband and I did not care for it because the mustard taste is absolutely overwhelming - and we both like mustard just fine. I had prepared it as directed, except I reduced the sugar to 1 teaspoon, and served it over red leaf lettuce. We were not impressed at all, but I made enough for lunch the next day, so we gave it another shot. Well, after it sat overnight, the mustard flavor became much more muted, and the salad was delicious! I was ready to write it off the night before, that's how much we didn't like it. My advice - make this salad BUT don't eat it until the next day!! Sounds crazy I know but it is a really good salad once the flavors meld a bit. If you do eat it right away, at least give it another shot the next day - you'll be surprised! :)

This salad was great over baby spinach, but the dressing wasn't great (the sesame oil and mustard were way overpowering) so we changed it up a bit... we only put in half of the sesame oil and used canola oil for the rest, only put in half the mustard and added a little bit of extra teriyaki sauce and vinegar.  We also put in a splash of water, and a little bit of honey. Came out awesome.

This is awesome; really awesome.  With the sesame oil and teriyaki sauce, it definitely has a delicious Asian flavor about it.  The only problem I had was not having enough of the liquid mixture to coat the dry ingredients thoroughly, possibly due in part to the extra 1/4 cup of chicken I added.  I added equal parts teriyaki sauce, distilled white wine vinegar and a sesame oil to more evenly coat the dry ingredients.  That seemed to help and did not hurt the taste.  This stuff is absolutely great!

This salad is DELICIOUS! I've made it twice in the last couple of days (for different social events) and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe except increase cilantro (love it) and put it in a nice low-carb wrap with chopped chinese cabbage. No one thought the mustard was spicy or overwhelming...not sure what people are talking about. :)

Fantastic. I doubled up on the dressing, as recommended. Only changes I made were to swap edamame for the peas and to add a little sriracha for some kick. I also ran out of sugar and only had 1 TBSP instead of the 4 doubling the recipe would call for. Honestly, it didn't need any more than that, as teriyaki is usually quite sweet. Stuffed it in pita pockets and me and my husband devoured it!

EXCELLENT!  I toasted Top Ramen (2 packages broken up) at 350 degrees for 12 mins, and used that instead of the toasted almonds since it was cheaper. I also added a small can of mandarin oranges, drained.  Restaurant quality!!

Love, love, LOVE this recipe!! Honestly, this is the best recipe I have found online. I made it as is and tossed with a couple handfuls of fresh spinach leaves. After the first time making it, I added more cilantro because I'm obsessed with the stuff.

Toast the almonds first! Until they are lightly browned and then toss with the warm chicken pieces. Chicken takes on flavor of almonds, fabulous!  Recipe: too many ingredients and dressing was awful to our taste. Chicken was lost. We'll stay with the chicken, almonds, celery and mayo. Gigi

Very tasty and nutritious. It takes me a little longer than 30 minutes to make with all the chopping, but this recipe is well worth the effort. I followed the recipe exactly, but I think it would also be good using meat from a store bought rotisserie chicken.

I am actually giving the dressing a 5 star rating. I had visited a local resturant and had a chicken salad served over romaine and lettuce. It was delicious but I noted their was something more to this than the chicken and greens. Something had been sprinkled over the entire salad and it tasted like teriyaki sauce. So I discovered this sauce and sprinkle it over all my chicken salads.I love the blend of flavors. Add grapes, sliced apples, and raisins to your chicken salad with this sauce over it all.

Very nice change for a supper!  Kids even ate some.  I didn't have the snap peas or almonds!  Really missed the crunch it would've added.  Forgot cilantro too. I used extra dressing.  Had Fish and Things Teriyaki Marinade and that was nice! Easy and delicious even in winter!

I would use 1 Tblsp dry mustard instead of 2 if, like me, you want a little less spice.  But good salad!

So delicious!  I added some chopped celery for the heck of it, and cut back on the sesame oil for personal preference.  When I saw someone say the dressing was spicy I was like what?  Okay now I know...the amount of ground mustard DOES make this pretty darn spicy...but I LOVED it!!  Glad I made extra cause I ate the leftovers as a midnight snack ;)

Enjoyed this recipe. I made a whole chicken from this site and used that as the chicken. The few changes I made where I omitted the red pepper and cilantro and used white wine vinegar. I was hoping to have leftovers but my hubby and I ate the entire thing for dinner. :)

This is very good if you're looking for a dressing that goes with Asian style salads.  I have made this numerous times over the past couple of months, and it's always something I look forward to eating.  It may only be me, but I notice it's a bit on the spicy side.  I think this is due to the dry mustard.  If you don't like the hint of spice, opt for less mustard or substitute.  Otherwise, excellent!

Made exactly as written. This was easy to make and tasted good, but wasn't a huge hit wit the fam. Next time I think I will steam the peas a bit simply for personal preferences.

Loved it.  I added cabbage and half a package of top raman noodles.  I also only used 1/2 of the called from mustard powder and it was still a bit spicy, but it was soooo good. Thanks for such a great recipe.

I doubled the sauce and served as lettuce wraps.  Excellent dish.  One word for those with kids.......the mustard made it too spicy for my friends kid but my kids loved it.  If you have an overly picky kid, reduce mustard powder.

Delicious! I cut back on the mustard and cilantro based on reviews and it lacked a zing for me. So I added it back in along with a light sprinkle of powdered ginger. I am looking forward to having the leftovers with shredded cabbage.

I loved all the color and the crunch of the almonds. I did agree with many of the reviews that if you eat it freshly made cut back on the mustard and cilantro - it was overpowering.  I had leftovers, so once it sat in the frig overnight, then the flavors were more muted and it was very tasty.  Would make again. And it's great in a whole wheat pita!

This is really good.  WW points is 7 but the servings are very large.  I toasted the pita pockets and ate in along with the salad.  My bell pepper was especially sweet which really made it tasty.  I think mandarin oranges would really be good in this also.  My husband like this also.

Very good!  I don't care for cilantro, so I left that out, but added some crushed garlic, toasted sesame seeds, & some broken up, dry Ramen noodles.  If you break the noodles up before adding them, the dressing begins to soften them up.  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

I prefer this with a different dressing: olive oil, rice vinegar, sugar (or Splenda), a little salt and pepper. Tastes very fresh with my dressing because it doesn't overpower the vegetables.

This salad is excellent! The dressing has zing to it - just the way I like it. I did not have chicken on hand so I used cutup turkey instead. Also used honey roasted sliced almonds instead of regular. Next time I may add water chestnut slices and some chow mein noodles. This may become a lunchtime staple!

I would make this with a little less cilantro, but that's just my taste. I liked the dressing, and will be serving it up with mixed salad leaves again in the future. Also I chose to poach the chicken breast in water with half an onion, some whole pepper corns and some cilantro. I then shredded it, and it turned out beautiful and moist.

This is a great salad!  It's beautiful colors and non-stop crunch are satisfying to the last bite.  I made two tiny changes:  I used seasoned rice vinegar instead of distilled, and about 1/4 the recommended amount of dry mustard.  Served on a bed of mixed greens, this was a delicious lunch.  Thanks for the recipe!  8 points+, and worth every one.

This salad was amazing!!! I used to get a salad like this at a restaurant and they stopped making it. This one is EVEN BETTER !!!  I had this as a meal and it was more than enough. Only change I made...was that I didn't add peas - my son won't eat them!

Agreed on the double dressing recomendation. Otherwise it was a delicious dish on a warm evening to enjoy. Sometimes a recipe can really shine through on more than flavor alone and this one for my wife and I was no exception. The combination of ingredients made for a truly enjoyable eating experience. It was a great mixture of ingredients to experience bite after bite.

I made this salad and a few friends had dropped by and tasted it- they all demanded the recipe!  The only thing I did different was increase the dressing recipe because more is always better, but I omitted the dry mustard because I couldn't find mine in my messy cabinet. It still was delicious and I noticed that a few other reviewers had said to cut back on the mustard. This was the best recipe ever!!

I know people hate it when others rate on a recipe that they changed, so I am giving this recipe (on it's original ingredients) 4 stars.    However, I will comment that the original recipe was too 'hot' for our taste, so I added some really good olive oil to 'tone' it down and I loved the recipe and would have given it a 5 star with the added olive oil.  I would add the olive oil to your taste but if I had to guess, I would say that I added about 1/4 cup amount and left everything else as is.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this exactly as recipe calls for.  Good, not great.  I would possibly make it again.  The mustard does make it spicy, try half and taste sauce then add more to taste.

Excellent recipe.  I added some shredded lettuce and sliced up a breast of fried chicken and put it on top.  I didn't have cilantro, but it was just as tasty.

I made this as written but did not put it together all at once. I put half the salad ingredients into the mixing bowl and the other half into containers for the next days lunch. Worked out really well. I served this on the bed of lettuce as suggested, but I think it would taste really good on rice vermicelli. Next time!

My whole family (other than me) was dubious about this because they just aren't big fans of salads.  I really liked it and insisted they all try it.  When my husband tried it, he said "That's weird."  I asked what was weird, thinking I could tweak the recipe  and he responded "it's weird that I like it."  Two out of three of my kids like it too, so I'll be making it again!

Loved it! It was incredibly easily, light calories and filling. I read one of the reviews and definitely agree that adding mandarin oranges balances out the sensation of the dry mustard (like eating wasabi). This recipe will be in my rotation from now on.

This was really good, but I changed it  so  much, it's hardly the same recipe.   I added shredded cabbage, fresh ginger, and lime (all must-haves, in my opinion), used soy sauce (I didn't have any teriyaki sauce on hand), and chose roasted peanuts over almonds.  I also cut the sesame oil back by 1/2 a tablespoon (because it's so strong).  The cilantro and dry mustard combination in this dish is genius.  I'll make this recipe again-and-again, but always with the changes listed above.

Nice crunch to the salad. Had it on top of warm brown rice and added yellow raisins.  Now one of our favorite dinners. Skipped cilantro as personal preference without.

GOOD  We enjoyed. Very nice summer lunch. I used roasted chicken from a grocery store. I liked this and will make again, but the dressing was not my very favorite. For me I will add a lot less mustard next time.

This is a great salad!! I would more than likely double the dressing, and keep half on the side for those who like extra dressing in their salad.

I love this recipe.  I did modify it to fit my personal preferences, but think it is a wonderful base.  The first time I made it, I let the dressing sit overnight and personally thought there was still too much of a mustard twang.  The second time I made it, I halved the mustard and that would have been perfect for my taste.  But I went further and added 1.5T peanut butter (my personal weakness).   Loved it!  I doubled the dressing and serve it over angel hair cabbage (just finely sliced cabbage).  I think additions of mandarin orange slices would be awesome (as other have suggested) or freeze dried cranberries.  I also use Chinese noodles sprinkled on the top for added crunch.  Thank you for this awesome recipe that is so easy to tweak for personal preferences!!!

Good mix of veggies- the colorful picture really drew me in. I have yet to make it cold, but as a hot entree with rice, both adults and teens have liked it. I look forward to trying it cold and mixing in other seasonal vegetables as the summer goes on. We serve lots of folks with nut allergies, so I left out the almonds and it is still good!

This is probably the best salad I have EVER tried, my mother is allergic to almonds so I used all ingredients except that, it had an amazing flavor and spice. Easy, but with the right presentation looks fancy.

Good hearty salad for a potluck offering. I followed the recipe except for the following changes- 1/4 pound of thawed frozen peas for the snap peas, 2 cups of sliced cabbage for crunch, cooked sliced rice noodles (less than 2 cups), no mustard (seemed wrong), rice vinegar for the white vinegar, and an extra T of teriyaki sauce.  I added sweet chili sauce  to my bowl for more spice.

I would have given this four stars, but I thought there was too much ground mustard. It was too spicy for my taste. Still, it was good, especially the way I served it -- over udon noodles with peanut sauce.

I thought this was just ok. I made everything the day before, except I toasted the almonds right before we ate. I stuffed pita bread with this salad. This wasn't bad, but I highly doubt I'd make it again.

Looking over other reviews, my recipe adjustments were: I didn't measure the ingredients. I had a green pepper instead of red.  No green onions, no sesame oil no cilantro, and no peas - I didn't have these ingredients. Other changes were doubling the dressing ingredients other than the mustard and adding olive oil. So to me the dressing taste was fine and also the amount was good too. We liked it also because there is no mayo in it.

Yum! This is fabulous.  I usually double the dressing, as I like a lot of sauce.  My red meat eating man even loves this.  Perfect for a light dinner in the heat of the summer.

We liked the salad but couldn't eat the dressing.  The mustard was over powering and bitter.  I will make again with no mustard and maybe red pepper flakes?  Eta:  I think the prob. with the dressing is that I used dijon mustard powder.

This was GREAT! I can't wait to make it again! I followed other reviewer's suggestions - only 1 Tbsp. of sugar as the teriyaki sauce is sweet. I added a chopped garlic clove to the sauce, and added some steamed green beans to the salad as well.

The dressing was strong for my taste - I thought it was the sesame oil that overpowered the dish, but after reading the reviews it might have been the mustard.  I will try review's suggestion and add olive oil to tone it down.  Otherwise, great reminder of how good salads really are!

This was a yummy salad.  The cilantro really added to it.  We ate it on sandwich bread the first night, but loved it leftover wrapped in a flour tortilla with a bit of teriyaki sauce.

This is a wonderful crunchy chicken salad!  The ingredients are very flexible. I add waterchestnuts and served these on hoagie rolls with baked fries.
