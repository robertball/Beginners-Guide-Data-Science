This cake is extremely wet, but it's sooo good. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used all purpose flour instead of cake flour. There is a lot of sauce, which makes it seem almost like a pudding. Excellent dessert. Next time I think I'll cut back a little on the brown sugar. Over all, delicious. Everybody loved it!

Very Yummy!! A bit rich, but very moist and delicious. I only used about 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was still great!

This was a good cake.  Very moist.  After reading the reviews I left out the cup of brown sugar and my hubby said that it was still very sweet.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

i thought that this cake was extremely sweet and i couldn't even tell there was pineapple in it. it was moist, but that wasn't enough to make up for the overpowering sweet taste of it. i would have liked the flavor of the pineapple to shine through more,but it just didn't. i will definitely look for a different recipe.

This cake has a lot of promise, but it's not a "pineapple cake." It's a cake where pineapple acts just like applesauce, replacing oil with sweet fruit pulp to make a healthier treat. To call it a pineapple cake is to raise the taste expectations to a level it can't meet. 
Though bland and sweet, this dense, moist cake is the perfect base for a coffee cake. All it needs is some zest. The next time I bake it, I'll add cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and a pinch of salt. I'll top it with a crumb blend of brown sugar, cinnamon, flour and butter. I think it will turn out 4-star tasty as well as 5-star easy.
