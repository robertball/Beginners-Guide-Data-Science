As suggested by other reviewers I halved the soy sauce. I now wonder if it was too little, I think I'll add a tad more next time.  There will be a next time as this is a different side dish and one that I'm happy I found. Thanks Outliercook!

I really like this recipe! I love the combined sweet and salty taste...however, I agree with the previous reviewer on the point of the recipe calling for too much soy sauce. I only added half of what the recipe said to use, and it came out great.

This recipe sounded delicious to me, but when I made it...too salty tasting--too much soy sauce!  The soy sauce covered the taste of cilantro and avocado completely-- which is what made it sound so good to me.

I followed others recommendation and halved the amount of soy sauce and I also doubled the amount of imitation crab meat (because that's how much I bought and didn't want to waste it).  It tasted wonderful and the dressing seemed just right.  Any more soy sauce and I think it would have been too much.  I will definitely make this again.

These noodles are so simple to make and sooo yummy! I used 1/2 cup soy sauce and found it sufficiently savoury and added another tablespoon of sesame seeds. Didn't have any baby salad greens, added some boiled chopped carrots for colour. And the recipe does improve with chilling. Thank you OutlinerCook for sharing! I will definitely be making this again!

This is my first time reviewing recipes after years using this site....I did take other reviewers suggestions of cutting the soy in half...and I left out cilantro because it's not a flavor I like personally...even before the mixture cooled it tasted AMAZING! I am definitely going to make this again! Worked well with whole wheat pasta also.

Halving the soy sauce was definitely a great idea. These noodles were SO YUMMY! I brought them to work and everyone loved them!

Delicious! yumm yumm yumm!  At first, I followed the advise of others and started with only 1/2 cup of soy sauce, thinking I could add more if necessary.  I did end up using the whole cup of soy sauce and did not find it too salty.  This may have to do with the brand of soy sauce you use?  Not sure, I use kikkoman only.  I did make one change as I forgot to buy sesame seeds.  I substituted a scant teaspoon of sesame oil for them and this was fantastic.  I will definitely make it again.

Wowsa! I made this for the first time tonight. It says it serves eight, but with a family of five, two of which are under 10yo, we had absolutely NO leftovers! Of course I made a few minor changes. I reduced the soy to 2/3 C, the oil to 1/4 C, and used a scant 1/2 C sugar. Even with these reductions in the sauce, I still had about 1/2 C of sauce left after all else was consumed. 

I am a vegan, so I opted to skip the crab meat. Instead I fried out a package of extra firm tofu in 1T of olive oil, 2t of garlic powder, and 2 chopped scallions. 

I had spinach on hand and it went perfectly with this meal. The avocado is the icing on the cake! It compliments the taste of the dressing in the perfect manner. 

I always ask my family if a meal is a do-over. This one was unanimous! My 7yo even asked if we could have it for breakfast tomorrow! :)

Meh.. this wasn't that great for me. I even tried halving the soy sauce and it still seemed to salty for me. I was a little disappointed. I really wanted the cilantro and avocado to stand out and this sauce just drowned it.

YUMMY! I made some changes:
used a bit less soy sauce, penne pasta, substituted sugar for splenda, used tuna instead of crab and spinach instead of mixed baby greens.
Amazing summertime dinner!

I didn't care for this noodle salad, I made it last night and I have been trying to think all day exactly what it is that didn't work for me and I can't even say. The mix of everything together just did not work :(

What an interesting blend of flavors. I decreased the amount of soy sauce, and unfortunately had to use dried cilantro, as I didn't have fresh on hand. Quick and tasty, thanks Outliercook.
