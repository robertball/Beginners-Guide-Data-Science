These funnel cakes were absolutely out-of-this-world delicious! I happen to love pumpkin pie, so I pretty much figured I would enjoy this recipe. Imagine my surprise when my hubby, who totally hates "pumpkin anything", devoured three of these and only left me one! The taste of the pumpkin is perfectly balanced with the suggested amount of spice. 
Very enjoyable. I highly recommend trying these; you will not be disappointed. Thanks, Lin!!!!

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I made my own pumpkin pie spice (a little extra cinnamon, scant 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp ginger, some fresh grated nutmeg).  I couldn't get it to come out of my funnel.  I resorted to the sandwich bag method, which was messy but worked, except I think I made the hole too big.  In spots the funnel cake was too thick, and it didn't cook all the way through.  All in all a messy but delicious recipe.  Worth the mess! Somewhere between funnel cake and pumpkin pancakes.  Whip cream or real maple syrup would have been amazing on it.  Rave reviews from my boyfriend and my neighbors.

I have made funnel cake a lot and this was more cake like in consistency than most funnel cakes. Because of how cake like it is I found it absorbed a lot of oil which made it heavy. Will not make again

I had several extra cans of pumpkin left over and was looking to do something different and kid friendly and I couldnt have picked a better recipe! This was the first time I ever made funnel cakes and until I found my rhythm, the first few were a little funky looking but let me say that the kids thought they tasted great, even my extraordinarily picky nephew loved them.  Thanx for sharing, will make again!

This recipe was great. I made them at our halloween party. They MUST be made to order. If you eat them as soon as they come out of the fryer they are fluffy and the perfect texture you would expect from a funnel cake. I dusted them with powdered sugar just like they do at the fair. I however being so busy didn't get to eat mine right away and while it had time to sit it became thick and very cake like as other posters had mentioned. My advice MAKE TO ORDER, eat fresh from the fryer! who can resist anyway. They were a hit at my party!

Wow, Linda, these are AWESOME!!!! My hubby loved them !(and for him to like a bread based dessert is just this side short of a mircale!) It did take a little practice to squirt the cake batter across the oil (I used a plastic zip lock with the corner cut on one end). I burned the first cake, but the 2nd and 3rd ones were perfect! We dusted with lots of pwrd sugar & I shared with my in-laws. Thanks!!!! See posted pics (: (: (: (: (:

I followed the recipe as is, tasted the batter, and found it didn't taste very sweet. So I added a few more Tbsp of Brown sugar. Still wasn't very sweet as is, but by the time we added the powdered sugar and some whipped cream, my sweet tooth got its fix. This fried up beautifully. I used the cut corner of a bag method, because the batter is so thick it doesn't pour through the funnel for a continuous flow. But I can squeeze it out the bag in a continuous stream, and it turned out great. They friend up easily, tasted great and no one was disappointed. not as good as leftovers for breakfast this morning, but still yummy. Thanks for the recipe. It was a fun pumpkin variation.

I think this was simply a matter of getting the oil the right temp.....The recipe made about three cakes, but only one came out just right. Pretty subtle pumpkin flavor, but very tasty!

The batter tasted really good.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I tried using a funnel to drizzle the batter but it was just coming out really slowly in little blobs.  I added milk to try to get it to come out faster.  Do NOT do this.  It made the batter flat and not light and airy.  I think in order to make it come out easier next time I will just squeeze it through a bag.  Either that or settle for little blobs instead of a nice pretty circle cake.  Because they tasted good.

I thought they were pretty good. I don't know why, but for some reason they seemed way to thick so I had to add some extra milk to the batch.

The recipe was a disaster. Didn't even come out like a funnel cake. Came out more like funnel fries. Soon as I poured the batter in my deep fryer, it crumbled apart. There was nothing I could do to save it. the batter itself tasted good but just wasn't a funnel cake. Very disappointed. Trying another recipe

I loved these funnels cakes as a fun way to use up some leftover pumpkin.  They are quick to make and taste fantastic!  I used a squirt bottle in lieu of a funnel and had to snip the nozzle a bit more to make a wider opening for the batter to come out to the consistency I wanted.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing, LINDA MCLEAN!

This was an ok recipe. It seemed to lack flavor though. It needed more pumpkin and more spice. It was too close to a plain funnel cake. Also they were very greasy and you had to eat them immediately.

It might be something I did, but these didn't get crisp enough for me.  They were too soft.
