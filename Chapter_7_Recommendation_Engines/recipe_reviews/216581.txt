i step the chicken stock up to 32 ounces instead of 26. I also increased the baking time to 5 hours because i used a 20 lb turkey ( put in oven bare, then added tinfoil after 30 minutes then removed tinfoil after 2 hours). it came out absolutely perfect! the brown on the skin was perfectly colored and the turkey was so flavorful and Juicy! I am def adding this recipe to my index!!

This was my first ever roast bird and SO easy!! It’s also the first time my photo has come out as good or better looking than the advertised “finished product”. The gravy got RAVE reviews. Family loved it. I’ll definitely be making this again!
