My Grandmother used to make a pumpkin pie like this at thanksgiving.  She never used a recipe, and we have tried, and failed, to make this pie like she used to.  It is a truly, delicious, creamy delight...and we always found room for it, even after a huge Thanksgiving dinner.  Thank you for including it in your recipe files.

This is delicious!  The first time I made this, I made as mini tarts by using 2/3 of the crust recipe and 1/2 of the filling recipe.  I cooked the crust for 5-8 minutes in mini muffin tins, then piped the filling in with wilton tip 1M and a pastry bag.  It made 30 mini tarts.  Absolutely yummy!

This was tasty and easy to make. I made a few adjusments for my family's taste. Instead of white sugar in the crust, I used brown sugar. in the filling I used fresh ginger and added 1/4 tsp. ground cloves.

This was an excellent dessert. Very light and not to pumpkin flavored. Quite easy to make. I served at a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe. There was not a crumb left.

Absolutely wonderful and easy to make!  Just make sure you don't burn the crust, I had to make another one, lucky I had the ingredients.  I served it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone (including the kids) loved it!  I'm keeping this recipe!

I had some problems with this one....the filling wouldn't set.  The flavor was good, but it was only partly eaten at Thanksgiving.  I would not try this one again..sorry!

I made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews.  This was the first tart I've ever made and not only was it so good, but it was so easy! Thanks for the stress reliever during the holiday season.

This was a wonderful tart, I followed the recipe as given and didnâ€™t have any issues like some others did, perhaps I just got lucky this time around.  This recipe is a keeper, thanks for sharing it with us.

Very nice and super easy tart.  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving and i made a pumpkin pie and a pecan pie as well.  It is not overly sweet at all and was a great dessert after stuffing ourselves earlier.

This is so good!  I wish the filling would thicken a little bit more, it was a little runny.  Maybe it was my fault.   But the crust is so fantastic!  I can't wait to try the crust on a pumpkin cheesecake.

We liked this one - the crust in particular was delicious. It was also extremely hard to cut, but it had a great flavor. I expected the filling to be more firm - it was almost like a thick pudding. I would make this again, but I probably wouldn't serve it to company.

i expected the pumpkin cream part to be a bit more firm.  maybe next time i will add more cream cheese and not as much cream.  but it was very good.  the crust is delicious.

This is a great alternative to pumpkin pie and still gets all those "fall flavours".
