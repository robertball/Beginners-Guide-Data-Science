This was a hit. I got a bunch of compliments at Thanksgiving. I'm never making stuffing in the oven again.
I peeled the apples, not sure if that was necessary, I thought it made them blend in a little better. Might try not peeling them next time.

Since I can’t have my mother’s stuffing anymore, I’ve had bagged/boxed stuffing, but this year I wanted something outside the box, so to speak. I wanted to make something fancier, so to speak. This stuffing is amazing and it’s not difficult to make! The fact that it cooks in the crockpot was very helpful on Thanksgiving Day, too. I bought a baguette the day before, cubed the bread, and toasted it under the broiler, leaving it in a ziplock bag overnight, as a prep step the day before. This is a point at which I should have seasoned the croutons, though. The apples: To peel or not to peel? I peeled 1/2 and left 1/2. Since the cooktime is long, I didn’t notice any difference between the two. I’ll definitely fine-tune this next time I make it!

Everyone loved the flavor, but it came out looking like slop. Wondering if buying the hard croutons versus fresh bread would help...

I usually make a different recipe for dressing every year. My husband said this was the best yet. Extremely moist. Will definitely make this one again. The crock pot was a great choice to free up the oven.

This recipe turned out better than I expected!  I decreased sage to 1.5 teaspoons and added 1/4 cup more stock.  I did spray slow cooker with no-stick cooking spray, but it stuck to bottom of pot anyway.  The prep time takes more than 20 minutes.
Will try this recipe again.

This had really good flavor and was easy to prepare. I think it would have been better if it could have been put in the oven for the last bit of cooking to crisp it up, but I would definitely make it again.
