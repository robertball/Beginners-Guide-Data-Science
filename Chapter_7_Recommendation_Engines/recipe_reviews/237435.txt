Very good.  The secret to a good cheesecake is all in how you blend the ingredients.  Beat your cream cheese with the paddle attachment first until it is creamy, then add your sugar, beat for another 3-4 minutes stopping to scrap the bowl, then add the zests, vanilla, beat for a few more minutes and after each egg just until it is combined.  This came out excellent, creamy, great consistency and great flavor.  I think the flavor will largely vary depending on your lemon and lime.  I use organic lemon and limes and I find they have a deeper, more intense flavor.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner. If I made it again I would go with a completely edible garnish like a yellow or green jelly bean on each slice. Most people enjoyed it. To help avoid an unsightly crack, I placed a dish of boiling water in the oven next to the cheesecake, and I didn't overbake it - this did help. I used a lot more zest and juice than the recipe called for - I think you have to - very bland otherwise. Also, I would add a drop or two of yellow food colouring. It did not come out as yellow as the picture shows.

Used this recipe for My dads Father's Day cake. I did add a teaspoon of lemon extract. Instead of graham cracker crust, I used a sugar cookie mix and baked for 7 minutes at 350. After it cooled,I poured the cheesecake batter over it and baked for 40 minutes. Turned out great!!!!

I wanted a tart and not too sweet lemon lime cheesecake recipe and this fit the bill. I tasted the batter and felt it could handle significantly more lemon flavor than the recipe indicated (I wanted super lemony). In addition to the lime juice and zest, I used the juice of an entire lemon and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon oil. It came out perfect. If you prefer a more subtle citrus flavor, use the recipe as written. Have already had requests to make this again.

Soooooo good!  It definitely helps if you have ripe lemons and limes.  I made it last weekend and it tested good enough to be the main dessert for Easter.  Make it!  It's so good!

This was a rich yet very light cheesecake. Tasty and not overly sweet! Just right!

Recipe was easy.  This was my first cheeseckae in a springform pan.  Was unsure on how long to leave in pan.  So I just wung it.  Lemon flavor really shined through!  Left out the lime, not crazy about it.  Followed directions and the cheesecake didn't come out looking like picture.  Still good.  Was unsure about not baking "crust" before hand.  But came out good.  Nice rich creamy cheesecake.  Perfect for summer time.

It was sooo good! I didn't put the icing on top and instead put candied limes and lemons on top. It tasted like a lemon pie with the texture of a cheesecake and a little bite of the taste of a cheesecake.
