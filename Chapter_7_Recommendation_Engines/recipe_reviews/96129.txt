This was good. I just added the cream cheese mixture from the Quick and Easy Taco Dip Recipe (which included mixing  8 oz cream cheese, 1/3 salsa or more based on your tasting, and 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning together), then I put my ground beef on top (I also added a couple of tablespoons of taco seasoning to my ground beef)and I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese. I covered it with aluminum foil and baked for about 20 minutes.

Of course have made Velvetta dip before but have never added cream cheese.  The cream cheese is what made this dip tasty and got lots of compliments.  With my hamburger I added some chopped onion then added black olives to the dip.  Will definitely make this again during the holiday season.

I've been making this for years and I make it often.   So easy and so good!  I mix the salsa in with the cooked ground beef mixture to soften the veggies just a bit and pour the whole thing over the cream cheese.  I also use mexican blend shredded cheese instead of the cheese slices.  I serve it hot from the oven with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and taco sauce, along with the tortilla chips.  THE BEST!!!

This is absoultely incredible!!  I made it for tailgating on Dec. 30 and have been requested to make 3 more times since then, and of course, for the Super Bowl!  The only thing I did differently was use 2 8-oz packages of cream cheese, and I took another reviewer's advice and added a couple Tbsps of taco seasoning to the beef.  Absolutely addicting, the name says it all, thanks!!

Really is the best dip for football games or any social gathering. Set it down infront of 5 of my friends and was gone in less than 10 minutes. Barely got any for myself. If looking for an easy, tasty, dip that everyone will like, this is the recipe you want!

This dip was a hit at a recent tailgating party! I should have doubled the recipe because it sure didn't last very long!

This is definitely a manly football dip! My boyfriend and roommate love this stuff like they're never going to see it again! The only change I made was adding a can of diced tomatoes and peppers, drained (Rotel) instead of the salsa because my guys like it to be more chunky and less runny. Using sausage in place of the burger also adds a zesty change as well. This recipe will be a keeper in my files forever! Thank you so much for sharing!

I have taken this dip to my Bunco group and everyone loved it! BUT I did make a few changes. I put taco seasoning the meat, used hot salsa, and the mexican flavored velveta cheese. Then i topped it with fresh tomato, green onions, and olives ( I like the color and flavor). ALso I doubled the recipe because I was feeding 16 adults. This is a great easy dip to make. I have also made it with ground turkey and no one knew the difference.

This by far was not the best football dip, in my opinion. It was a good base to start with, but it would definitely need some work.

So yummy, but looks nasty!  That is the only reason for not giving it five stars, the taste is great, but don't make it if you want visual appeal :)

This was the first thing gone at my work potluck! I used a pound of shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed loaf. The cream cheese really made this dip excellent!

This was a very yummy dip.  I replaced the cream cheese with my family's homemade chevre (goat) cheese and used cheddar instead of the cheese food.  I also added some chopped onion and 1 pkg. of taco seasoning to the browned beef.  Great for all kinds of parties.

I use ground turkey instead of ground beef and it tastes just as good! I also add some onion and garlic to the turkey to season it a bit. This is the best dip!

This dip IS the best ever. I make it for potlucks at work for both me and my husband and for gatherings at home. EVERYBODY goes crazy for it. It's always the first thing to go. I love it!!
I sometimes substitute ground turkey for the ground beef. Make sure this is seasoned very well. This adds tons of flavor to the dish. I'm going to try adding the taco seasoning the next time I make it, as another reviewer mentioned.

I made this because my boys love cheese. It was really good. Just wanted to note that if you have a super amazing salsa on hand (like home made) there is really no need for taco seasoning or what-not that some reviewers suggested. And although it was awesome, it didnt look appealing so ill remember to dress it better (not that my boys care...)

If you add 2 Tbsp from a packet of taco seasoning to the cream cheese, and the remainder of the package to the meat (I even used ground turkey instead of beef)...this recipe is a winner!

My husbands exact words "This is the Best Football Dip I have ever had!" The only changes I made was I used two packages of cream cheese and chili w/o the bean instead of hamburger. That made it WAY easier. With football season coming up, I KNOW my hubby will be requesting this recipie.

This was excellent.  I had zero leftovers when I took it to a superbowl party.  I did at taco seasoning to the meat and the sour cream, however.  I also added a little shredded cheese to the top.  Great for a quick, zero fuss appetizer!

Excellent! I added the taco seasoning to the hamburger, then combined the meat, salsa and cream cheese. Topped with Velveeta slices and baked at 350 until the cheese was melted and bubbly. It was gone in one day!

Fantastic!  Followed recipe as it is.  Half of us thought some light Mexican seasoning in the meat would be good and the other half thought it wasn't necessary - do what you like!

I made this for a boys poker party and it was ok. I made it exactly as written and it was just bland. I think that it would be perfect with taco seasoning added to the beef prior to adding the cheeses. The boys seemed to like it ok but there was more left then with other dips I have made for them!

Good and Easy. We love our food spicy, so next time I will add a couple of dashes of mexican hot sauce to our meat prior to layering. This was a hit on Superbowl Day.

Your right, this was the best football dip ever! Doubled the recipe and used 1lb of ground beef and 1lb of sausage. Scaled the velveeta down to 3/4 of what is called for, just because of some reviewers complaining it was too salty/cheesy. Turned out great! Will definitely make this again in the future!

this was a great dip for anytime.  i think next time i will just mix it all together & put it in the crock pot instead.  mine was a bit messier than i thought it would be & ended up mixing it in the pan when it was ready.  great dip though.  thanks!

My family loved it!!!! But if you are cooking for more than about 6 people you probably want to to double the recipe. It does go fast! I used cream cheese with chives; sliced up what I had left of velveeta (just less than half lb.) and shredded medium cheddar on top of the velveeta. I will probably try taco seasoning on the hamburger next time since I did not have any today.  But it was very good even without the taco seasoning!! I am sure I will be making this again soon and often.

An EXCELLENT no-cook version of this can be achieved by substituting the beef and salsa for a can of Steak chili. I love using either Stag brand or Campbells(?). I use a pie dish, spread the cream cheese package, pour the can over the top, top with shredded colby or mexican blend cheese and heat until bubbly...also, my party guests LOVE the Frito scoops with this dish. I usually make 2, 'cause 1 just doesn't last long enough!!

This is a great recipe, however, I changed a couple of things. I added a pound of spicy breakfast sausage and put it all in a crock pot to keep t warm instead of warming it in the oven. It was a huge hit, and didn't last very long at all. Yum.

This was pretty great. I added some garlic salt and black pepper to the meat, and next time I would double the cream cheese, since that was our favorite part.

Amazing and oh so easy. Very flexible dip, I used a mix of misc cheese that I had open and a good beer. We so yummy with soft pretzels. Made enough to freeze for another date - looking forward to pulling it out of the freezer soon.

I made this a few times and used a three cheese cheddar blend on top. Not only did it look great but tasted great too.

I made this at the last Superbowl Party, my hubby and his 3 brothers were like 
ravaging animals! I had to make two more batches.

This was kind of blah. I would definitely add more ingredients if I make it again.

Add diced green onion over the salsa and use either the Mexican blend of cheese or shredded cheddar instead of the "processed" cheese.  Sliced jalapeno's on top prior to baking or microwaving give it a nice "bite"!!

This was a good dip, but used the tried and true velveta cheese loaf. Overall, too salty and not enough substance to balance out. I've since gone back to a similar recipe I've always made that is thin cream cheese on bottom, then refried beans, black beans, thick layer of burger (taco seasoned with chopped grilled onions), shredded light Mex mix cheese, topped with can of grilled diced tomatoes with green chilis. I also sprinkly on finely diced jalepeno on top to finish off. Good stuff and a party favorite.

I also added taco seasoning to the meat but still found this dip to be just ok. I still had half of it left over after the party.

Everyone LOVED this dip. I will change it up a little by using Mexican Velveta, perhaps half hot sausage & ground beef and medium salsa.  I used the taco seasoning idea and even with that this was a winner.

Great recipe! I made a batch for today's Indy Colts opener and am having trouble leaving it alone until my buddies arrive for the game. I added some chopped onions and black olives. I also used the HOT Pace salsa. Makes the beer that much better! GO COLTS!!

I made this for one party and now its a request anytime we go to a party.  Very Yummy!!!  We all love it!  I add taco seasoning to the meat and use taco sauce instead of salsa.

I'm SO impressed with how this came out!  I'm typically not into this kind of recipe, but as soon as I tried it I couldn't stop eating it! I followed reviews from other I read, added taco seasoning and onions, stirred after I took it out of the oven.  I can't tell you enough, it was ridiculously good! Try it!! It's so easy and so good.

My neighbor cooked this years ago when I was just a kid. I forgot how to make it and recently found it here! I add canned jalapenos to the top about 10 minutes into baking for that extra kick.

I loved it!  I'm all about the 4 ingredient recipes and this tops the list. I did add taco seasoning to the meat which made it perfect.  I'm a big fan of cream cheese so I think I'll double the cream cheese next time, but it was great as is.
