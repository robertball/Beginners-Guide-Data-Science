A Prickly Pear Margarita is AWESOME. I was first introduced to them at the Hilton in Tuscon, AZ. This isn't their recipe though... Their recipe is 1 1/2 oz Tequila; 1 oz Prickly Pear syrup; 1 oz triple sec; 1 1/2 oz lime juice. Place in shaker; shake and strain into a salted rim glass. I actually stashed up on the prickly pear syrup to bring back home with me.

IMO..I think the amount of Prickly Pear syrup with the sugar would make this WAY too sweet.
