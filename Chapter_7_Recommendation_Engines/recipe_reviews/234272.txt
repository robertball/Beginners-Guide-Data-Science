My 1 year old scarfed this down. Quick and easy for week day lunch and way better than a box of macaroni and cheese.

I liked this. Very easy. I added some chopped onion and used frozen broccoli and I added some diced ham for a one pot meal. Oh, also threw in a spoonful of sour cream to up the creaminess, as i didn't have quite the amount of cheese stated. I cooked it 20 minutes though. I think that might solve the runniness problem some people had.

Made this exactly to the recipe, except it had to simmer for 15 minutes instead of 10.  It was a hit.  Grandkids loved it.  I may try this with Parmesan or blue cheese next time for an added kick in flavor.

It was too runny, and lacked flavour. I would use less liquid and some more spices.

I love this recipe! It is quick and very adaptable. I use coconut oil and omit the salt. I add Perdue shortcuts chicken and broccoli. A great meal for my humans and my dog!

I rated this a 5 because of the adaptability of it along with the ease and one pot prep. Change the vegetables, add some rotisserie chicken or ground beef, whatever. I also add a teaspoon of Morton's All-Seasons to jazz it up a bit. You are only limited by your imagination.

This was so easy!  I loved that I could use frozen veggies, though I mixed it up and used a different mixture.  Served this for dinner with a rotisserie chicken - one dish to clean and leftovers to boot!

Tweaked the recipe with sauteed garlic, parsley, smoked paprika, salt, pepper and used a ratio of 1:1.50 rice and stock with a lesser amount of sharp cheese.
It came out perfect.

Im a mom of 4 picky kids. Made this for dinner last night and they loved it, minus the veggies of course. Nothing can convince them to eat veggies! I used brown rice (a healthier alternative) and i added grilled chicken breast also. love it! But totally forgot to take a pic

I added onion and jalapeno too.  Yummy.  I also added garlic but it was good without as well.

I agree with others that you only need 2 cups of stock rather than the three.  I doubled the recipe and added 2 chopped jalapeños with the other ingredients and then cooked it.  We loved it!

What a DELICIOUS meal!! I only did 2 cups of chicken broth& I added garlic salt. It was perfect for my son who loved it, and I certainly approve this meal for a fast paced mommy! Yum!

I think it should read 2 cups broth. When made as directed it was so watery and required a long time to cook down which made the rice over-cooked and pasty.

I made a large pot of this. I had to use half sharp cheddar and half mozzarella because I was low.... came out fantastic. For veggies I used fresh cut carrot and frozen corn. Also took the advice to add garlic powder. Yum!

I read some of the reviews before making this and made a few changes. I used olive oil to saute some garlic and onion before I added the other ingredients. I didn't have enough chicken broth so I used 2-1/2 cups water with 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder instead. I added a whole 16 oz bag of frozen mixed veggies instead of measuring out 2 cups worth. I only had regular white rice so that's what I used. After I brought it to a boil I simmered everything for 20 minutes to make sure my rice was cooked enough. I also added a few good shakes of Mrs. Dash's herb seasoning and a few shakes of black pepper. I'm not sure how much cheddar cheese I added because I didn't measure it out but just dumped what I had left in the pot. I think it was probably only a little over a cup though. 
That sounds like a lot of changes but I basically followed the recipe except for adding the garlic and onion and Mrs Dash's seasoning. It tastes fairly good but it still seems like it could use a little extra flavor. I think next time I'll saute a bit more onion and garlic and maybe add some more herb seasoning. 
 I think this recipe is a very flexible one and can be changed up to suit people's tastes.

I used 2 cups of French onion soup instead of chicken stock and I cooked it on low for 20 minutes.  Used Cajun seasoning 1/2 teaspoon instead of salt. I thought the dish was OK. It’s got a bit of kick to it Because of the seasoning kind a like it that way.

I will try this recipe again.

I made some changes to this based on what other reviewers had said. I sautéed a shallot before adding in the other ingredients, I also added some garlic salt and used a little less cheese. I made this using chestnut mushrooms and some frozen peas, really quick and very tasty!

I made this dish as a side dish. It was okay but I wasn't extremely impressed. After following the directions exactly (except adding a few minutes cooking time) I wasn't to excited about serving this. I tasted it and decided to add some sour cream as another rater had suggested. I also added some cilantro which improved the taste. However, I found the dish to be to heavy even before my additions. On a positive note, the men in my family liked this and returned for seconds and my grown daughter said it tasted like something she had in a restaurant at some point, and did not like it then either.

This was super easy, and my picky toddler ate his veggies!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was a little runny, and I added onion powder, garlic powder, and a little cayenne pepper to add a little more flavor.  I also added bite sized pieces of turkey sausage to make it a one pot meal.  I will definitely make this again, and will keep the tweaks.
