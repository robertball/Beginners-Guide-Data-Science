I omitted the sugar, figuring that the beets were sweet enough!  Great taste!  The few crispy chunks mixed with the cooked beets is a good contrast!  The color is pleasing! This will make a great picnic salad!

Great basic recipe.  At the risk of being jumped on by the 'review police', I did make a few changes to suit my family's palate.  Mixed it with smoked trout and a touch of horseradish.  This then became a light meal for lunch, not just a side.  Good recipe, easy to prepare and very tasty.

I like all of the ingredients -- just not together.

My boyfriend and I love this dish! The cucumber and beets are a great combo for the palette and the eggs take care of any protein cravings. Thanks, Alf!

I, too, skipped the sugar, diced the onions and used a pinch of dried dill - SO delicious!!

Thanks be to the commenters & Alf - this truly is a nice summery salad.

Great salad! I left out the onion due to personal preference. As I'm the only one in the family that likes beets, this salad was just for me.  Unfortunately it doesn't sit well after a day, so if I were to make it again I would cut it down to 2 serves and have one each for lunch and dinner the same day, otherwise it goes to waste.

This is my all time favorite beet recipe! I always double this recipe because it is so delicious and tastes even better the next day! I followed it almost exactly except I used apple cider vinegar and completely omitted the sugar. I added chopped colored carrots. Sometimes I par boil the carrots but it adds a nice crunch to leave them raw. I also use half golden beets and half red beets just for the fun of it. This is a remarkably and memorable salad!!!

Great recipe, although next time I will dice the onions instead of using slices, and use 1/2 amount of sugar or omit altogether, was a bit too sweet for me.  Thanks for sharing.

I used bottled beets; I was in a hurry and didn't want to make a huge mess. The flavors were bland, and my husband thought the eggs gave the salad a "weird consistency" with the cukes and beets. I thought it was good, but I would try to amp up the flavors somehow if I made this again.
