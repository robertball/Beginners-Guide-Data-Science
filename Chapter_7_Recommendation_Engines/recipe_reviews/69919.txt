I have made these several times for tailgating parties.  I put the brown sugar in a ziploc bag and shake a few pieces of bacon and a couple smokies then wrap them up.  I also sprinkle more brown sugar on top before baking.  If your bacon isn't crisping up, put your pan under the broiler for a few minutes.  Be careful, though, I almost caught the toothpicks on fire!!!

I made these for a weekly get together with friends and was requested, nay DEMANDED to make these two days later for another party. WONDERFUL, EASY appetizer! TIPS: Definately use foil on your pans when baking. Cook for first 25 minutes at 325 and the last 15 minutes at 350. Use center cut, thin sliced bacon and cut in half. Less fat and no need for toothpicks. Also if putting in a slow cooker to keep warm, pour a half a cup (or so) of maple syrup in the cooker to help keep them moist. EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!

"Meat Candy" is what my BF called this.  He requested a creamy horseradish dip to go along with it to balance the sweetness of the "meat candy".  I will use the yummy "tiger dill sauce" recipe from Outback Steakhouse. Blend together: 2/3 C. Sour Cream, 1/4 C. Mayonnaise, 3 tsp. Prepared Horseradish
3/4 tsp. Sugar, 1/4 tsp Dill Weed.

Awesome recipe. I made these for our Christmas get together this past weekend. Out of all the appetizers I served, this was the first one to go. To ease in preparation, I prepared all of these the week before and froze them individually on cookie sheets. After they were frozen I put them into freezer bags and stored them until I needed them. I took them straight from the freezer and put them on a cookie sheet, sprinkled with brown sugar and cooked them at 400o for about 30 minutes. They came out wonderfully and I will be making this recipe again! I still have some bacon wrapped smokies in the freezer!

Definite Man Pleasers!!!  Use maple flavored bacon for extra flavor and disposable baking sheets.  Cooked for 35 minutes and upped the temp to 450 the last 5 minutes or so which helped carmelize the brown sugar.  Hint:  If you chose to up the temp, stand guard over your oven as these are apt to burn quickly if you're not careful.

I have made these several times & they ALWAYS dissappear! I pre-cook the bacon in the micro till soft before wrapping & putting them in the oven. I also line a baking sheet with foil, put the doggies on a baking rack on the foil, & then sprinkle the brown sugar on. This prevents a nasty clean up, and the sugar & bacon grease meld. I put the doggies in a crock & pour the grease/sugar mix over them, sprinkle more brown sugar on them, stir, and put the lid on the crock. It really makes a great sauce on them!! yum yum yum hubby & I LOVE  these!!

outstanding!!  i've made these a couple of times for parties - and they always disapear so quickly!  everyone raves about them!  This last time i rolled them the night before (so i didn't have to prep the day of).  dredged the bacon in brown sugar - and rolled and toothpicked right in the brown sugar.  put them all in a bowl and marinated in the fridge over night (mm..you'll have a nice "brownsugary marinade" the next day).  baked about 2 hrs before the party - 350 about 15-20 min then flipped them and baked 15 more min.  Then put them all in a crockpot on low and poured the "juices" that were in the marinating bowl (mixed with 1/4 cup maple syrup) poured over smokies in the crockpot.  kept on "low/warm" for the entire party.  mmmm....perfect!!!

This is the easiest recipe ever! It came out soo delicious even my 3 year old loved them! She wouldn't stop eating  it. I read some of the reviews before I made it. I put the brown sugar and little sausages in a gallon sized zip lock bag, then shook it. I also used maple flavored bacon instead of the regular (let me tell you it brings more to the recipe! A definate must try!). Instead of using foil I put a cooling rack on the baking tray and sprayed it with non stick cooking spray so that the bacon won't stick to it and placed them on there, and I lined the tray with foil for easy clean up. It came out nice and crisp all over when it was done. I baked it at 400Deg. F for 40-45 minutes and they came out nice and crisp. With Super Bowl Sunday coming up this will be the perfect bite sized snack for the fellas!

We call these "pig candy". This is a real man pleaser. Be sure to use cocktail smokies sausages instead of weiners for better flavor. These are great for tailgating, bowl parties or family get togethers. I don't find it time consuming at all. Just whack your pound of bacon into thirds, wrap a piece around a smokie and stick a toothpick through it. I don't measure the brown sugar, just dump it on. Be sure to line your pan with heavy foil so clean up is a breeze!

Wonderful!  A BIG hit at our football party!  I wrap each smokie in 1/3 a piece of bacon.  I did not use the toothpicks, they rolled nicely and stayed rolled without them.  I used about 1 cup of brown sugar, and baked for 50 minutes, then broiled on high for 4 minutes before removing to crockpot set on warm setting.  Will make again and again!  Thank you for a great recipe!

What a great recipe using just a few ingredients. Served these as appetizers during the football game and they disappeared in 15 minutes. One thing I found was that 40 minutes wasn't really enough time to get the bacon crisp. What I ended up doing was baking 1 hour at 325 degrees, then increasing that to 350 degrees for 15 more minutes. With these changes, they came out "perfect".

Great recipe. I make them every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Covering the bacon in brown sugar first, then wrapping the mini wieners works well. And rather than using toothpicks, I just use large skewer sticks and put about 5-6 on each stick.  You can fit about 10-12 skewers on a baking sheet, and it makes it very easy and quick to turn them half way through cooking. Most people enjoy eating them off the stick too, or you can just remove them and put them in a crock pot/warming dish and they don't fall apart after being cooked.

I also make these bacon wrapped smokies but cook them at 250 for 2 and 1/2 hours.  This "slow" cooks them and the bacon is DELICIOUS !!  One other thing, I also lay out the strips of bacon and sprinkle with brown sugar, then lay the smokie on top and wrap.  This keeps the sugar on the inside and makes a sort of glaze......yummy !!

I made these for an office pot luck and they were a huge hit. After reading through reviews, here is how I did it:  (Double batch, 2 freezer bags} Night before, using thick cut bacon, cut bacon in thirds and wrapped and secured with toothpick.  Put them all in a freezer bag with 1 cup brown sugar.  shook it a few times.  In the morning, on a foil covered, pam sprayed cookie sheet, sprinkled a bit more brown sugar & baked at 400 for 30 minutes, each batch.  Put 1 cup ordinary maple syrup in crock pot, put smokies in and sprinkled a little more brown sugar on top.  When I got to my office, put slow cooker on warm til lunch time, about 4 hours.  Came out perfect!  I was embarrased by the praise I received.  VERY easy.

I received this recipe from a friend 20 years ago and it is still my most requested appetizer for gatherings and my families favorite.  My recipe is a little different.  I use 1 package bacon cut into 1/4 pieces and 2 packages of reg little smokies and 2 cups brown sugar.  Roll them up and pile up the sugar to coat.  I make a day ahead of time and give them time to cure. Place them in a 9x13 glass baking dish and cover with foil.  Store in refrigerator until ready to cook.  Bake at 350 for 45 minutes, uncover and cook an additional 15-20mins.  Do not line pan with foil (overcooks/burns).  Immediately transfer to serving dish. Allow pan to sit and cool and the grease will solidify making for an easy clean up.

These are so good!

These are the best!!!  One thing I learned is that if you put 5 to 6 of these on long bamboo skewers...they are much faster and easier to turn.  When they are done you can just use a fork to push them off.   The bacon will hold tight by then.

One of our favorite holiday appetizers. I like to serve this with a dip made from a cup each of barbeque sauce and grape jelly. These never fail to disappear.

A classic family favorite.  Thought I'd share a tip for this one.  Very cold bacon is best as suggested but I cut each strip (several at one time) into 1/8 pieces.  Put small piece of bacon on top side of smokie and secure with toothpick.  I use same amount of brown sugar.  They taste just as good with a small piece of bacon, look prettier, and are a heck of a lot easier to clean up pan!

Hubs insisted I make these after someone brought them to a Christmas celebration at the office.  I didn't think I would be a fan and it turned out I was correct.   Rich, greasy and sweet.  I get a little queasy just thinking about them.  (If I were to make these again - and I won't - I would shave a few minutes off the cooking time as the bacon was a tad overdone)

These require some work but it's sooooo worth it.  Few key things to remember: Prep the night before Skewer them to make flipping easier USE DISPOSIBLE FOIL SHEET PANS!!! Bake- then broil for just a few mins to crisp them up.

I cut the bacon into 1/3 but didnt have any toothpicks. It didnt matter. Used closer to a cup of brown sugar to make sure all of the smokies were nicely covered. Baked as directed, then I broiled them for 3 minutes to crisp the bacon. I also drizzled 1/2 cup maple syrup over the top after cooking to keep them moist while being kept warm as another reviewer suggested. OMG. These did not last long. You might want to double or triple the recipe and be prepared to make them again.

I made these for New Year's Eve. Everybody loved them. Personally, I thought they were a bit too sweet, but that's just my taste. One word on the prep; I just put a piece of bacon on the cutting board, wrapped the smokie  in it until there was a slight overlap, cut the bacon with scissors, & stabbed it with a toothpick. Much easier than cutting the bacon into thirds since the smokies are not always the same size.

these are addictive! Use 1/2 strip of bacon per smokie..this is plenty! Also, for easy cleanup use parchment paper on cookie sheets. These can be rolled ahead of time but NOT sugared..it will melt and then burn when they cook.

I have been making these exactly this way for at least 10 years.  Everytime I make them, they are always the first thing to go!!  Everyone loves them and I always have several people ask me for the "recipe". They are always amazed at how simple they are to make.  I would give 10 stars if I could.

These were a big hit at our BBQ party over the weekend.  The guys devoured them.  I used center cut bacon, cut in thirds, then wrapped each smokie securing with a toothpick.  Before placing on the foil-lined cookie sheet, each bacon-wrapped smokie was rolled in brown sugar.  Once all the smokies had been wrapped, secured and ready for the oven, more brown sugar was added.  After baking, I removed the smokies to a crock pot to keep warm and poured the drippings from the cookie sheet on top.  It kept them moist and added more sweetness.  My guests loved them!

I followed this recipe to the letter squared!  I made a double batch!  With all the food at the Super Bowl party, this was the first to empty out well within 20 minutes!  I don't like bacon much, but I did go back for more!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!  I already have requests to do it agian.  Yeah for Greenbay!!!!

So YUMMY, had a hard time keeping them on the plate for everyone. I used a large ziploc bag and threw the brown sugar in there and then cut the bacon into two pieces and shook it up. Wrapped each one with no toothpicks, fold down. I highly recommend using aluminum foil it's much easier to clean up. You and your guests will enjoy these very much!

I made this as one of my Super Bowl appetizers. I had never had them before but after reading the reviews I knew I had to try them. Plus I wanted to make something that could be made up ahead. I cut the bacon in 3rds, layed the brown sugar on the bacon & then rolled up the smokie & secured with a toothpick. I lined a baking sheet with greased tin foil & popped them in the oven when the Super Bowl started. They were done in about 50 mins. I also made the dip listed on this site. These were devoured in no time @ all & I was asked if I had any more!! Since they are not the healthiest thing to eat I won't make them often but I will definitely make them again.

Just made these for a party and they were a big hit. As per several reviews I used center cut bacon. It is thicker cut and fewer slices per container, so 1 lb didn't cover the whole pkg of smokies. I just cooked the uncovered smokies with the bacon wrapped all sprinkled liberally with the brown sugar. The smokies that didn't have bacon picked up all the flavors. I did the 325 for 35 mins and then put the broiler on high w/o moving them up in the oven and they came out perfect. After cooking, I put them in a warmer w/ maple syrup drizzled over them and they were truly over the top.

These are awesome. I used center cut bacon and cut them in half with kitchen sheers. One third of a strip doesn't really do the trick. I froze them like Jen R suggested but when I cooked them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, they burned with the brown sugar hardening on the bottom. So next I cooked them at 350 degrees for 40 minutes and they were perfect. Again, these are wonderful. I keep a supply in the freezer at all times.

OMG!!  These are soooo good!  I don't think my grandsons would let me in the house on holidays or birthdays without bringing them some of these.  I just wrap them up, throw them in a baggie with brown sugar.  Then bake as directed.

No need for tooth pics, and whatever you do, make at least 2 times more than you think you will need.  They go fast!  The only thing sweeter than these was watching the Steelers lose!

These are really a great item to take to a potluck or party.  I have made them about 6 times and modified the brown sugar amount, for personal preference.  For one bag of wienies I only use about 1/3-1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I found 3/4 to be overwhelmingly sweet.  Also, make sure to use decent bacon, because the more fat the bacon has, the less flavor (and more grease) it produces.  I cook them in the oven as the instructions say, then take them to parties in a crockpot on low, just to keep them warm.  They never dry out in there, even by the end of the night.

Never have any of these leftover.  I actually use a pound of smoked sausage that I cut into about 1/2 inch thick discs, wrap those in a half piece of bacon each, cover with brown sugar in a 9 x 13 baking dish and bake for an hour at 350.  Always a HUGE hit. :)

These are fabulous! I made 3 packs of sausages for a get together and they lasted less than 20 minutes. I did try the trick of placing them on a cookie rack and they cooked evenly. I did use foil to make the clean up easier. Completely unnecessary, as I didn’t make the foil long enough to cover the pan. I made them again today with a disposable foil tray and sprayed the rack with cooking spray. Way better cleanup. I will definitely be making these often.

I tried these for the first time for a friend's surprise 50th birthday party.  I doubled the recipe as there were a lot of people coming.  I wished I had made twice as many as that!  So simple to make and EVERYONE raved about them!  They were gone in no time!  A real hit!  A hint....use disposable aluminum pans to bake or line your cookie sheet HEAVILY with foil!  The brown sugar carmelizes and makes a syrupy mess to get off of a pan!  It's well worth it though!

THANKS for this recipe! Everyone loved these and they were the very first things to vanish. I used two packs of 12-oz Hillshire Farms beef smokies and two packs of center-cut Oscar Mayer bacon. Trying to be budget-conscious, I cut the bacon into thirds. That worked because the end-pieces weren't just fat. If the bacon were all fat on the ends, some of the smokies would have ended up with all fat. One strip of the "thirds" was too small, but we had enough without using those. (That bacon became breakfast.) I used a ziploc bag to coat everything, prepared it the day before (which is GREAT to be able to do), and drizzled the juice that had accumulated in the bottom of the dish over the smokies and sprinkled with a little extra brown sugar when I went to cook them. I baked them at 350 for 15 min each side, then broiled for 2 min to crisp them. I then placed them (and the remaining juice) in a buffet warmer set on low. I did this 3 hours before our party. They held up very nicely until devoured by the crowd. Great recipe for doing ahead!

These are my favorite thing to make for get togethers.  Everyone alwasy loves them.  I fry the bacon a little first before wrapping and I usually keep in the oven an extra 15-20 minutes to make sure the bacon is crispy.

I followed other reviewers suggestions by using center cut bacon and dipping it in brown sugar and then wrapping the smokey in the bacon in the brown sugar bowl.  I wrapped them the night before and then left them sitting in a bowl overnight to make for quick cooking the next day.  

I followed another reviewers idea to cook them at 400 for 40 minutes and then broil the last 4 minutes...BAD IDEA.  They looked really dark after 40 minutes!  I would either cook them as the recipe recommends or higher heat for shorter time (seems obvious, I know, not sure what I was thinking).  

They tasted ok with the recipe as stated but then I put them in a pan with the juices that were left from them sitting in the bowl overnight along with 1/4 cup maple syrup as other reviewers recommended and they were MUCH better (the 1 star was taken off because they were a little bland before the addition of the maple syrup).  The maple flavor definitely adds a lot.  These were a big hit.  Next time I'm going to be more careful about watching them while they are in the oven.

I didn't use toothpicks because the bacon stuck to the smokies.  After cooking, a FEW of them came unwrapped so I stuck toothpicks in them to hold the bacon on.  Next time, I will use toothpicks on all of them because we set these out on a plate and people grabbed the ones with toothpicks first because they were easier to pick up.

What a delicious treat!  I put the smokies in a large ziplock baggie, and coated them with the brown sugar.  Left them in the fridge for a few hours.  Then, after wrapping, putting them onto toothpicks, and laying them on the baking tray, I took the melted sugar and poured some over each one.  AMAZING.  I've made them both ways, and here you get more of that great brown sugar flavor.  Be sure to flip them over 1/2 way through baking to crisp the bacon.

I've made these for years and they are a hit at every party. The only difference though is that I cook mine entirely in the crock pot for about 4 hours. Lot easier cleanup and serve right from crockpot. Just be sure to not overcook the sausages or the bacon will fall off the toothpick. Yum!

This recipe is the bomb!  Also found on this site was a DIPPING SAUCE that makes the complete package!   Mix 1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, and 2 tbsp. brown sugar until the sugar melts in.  That's it....great stuff!

I made these for Easter and now my hubby asks for them all the time! I use 1/4 piece of bacon, wrap them and use a toothpick to secure.  (easier to eat that way)  Then I put them in a big gallon bag and pour the brown sugar on top and shake them.  (be careful not to poke yourself with the toothpicks!) then I place on a plate and refrigerate overnight.  This creates this wonderful syrup.  I then place on the baking sheet (FOIL REQUIRED!) and then sprinkle with more brown sugar.  I keep the syrup, and after baking the smokies, I place them in a crock pot and pour the syrup over them.  Delicious!

A real crowd pleaser.  Taking it to a pot-luck again today.  Always get asked for the recipe.  I do make a few changes to decrease the "artery-blocking factor".   I use the turkey smokies that I find are available most places.  Just picked them up yesterday while shopping at target.  I also use a low sodium bacon which still has plenty of sodium for flavor.  If you like turkey bacon..i have used that in the past and the taste is good....but not as good as regular bacon.  Mostly due to texture.   I like the to up the temp to 425 for the last 5-8 minutes of cooking just to carmelize or crisp the brown sugar on top.   Enjoy.  My sister in law was visiting with her husband recently and I made these for some football watching.  They have a two hour drive home and called me from  the road because they wanted to get the ingredients on their way.  We call it "MAN CANDY".

So easy to make, yet fabulous!  These were out of this world.  If I could give it more then 5 stars I would.  We made two full trays of them for a birthday party tonight.  Our family friend who suffers from leukemia and has absolutely no appetite due to her medication devoured a half a tray by herself!!!  That alone makes this recipe stand out above the rest of the best!  Thank you sooooo much for sharing it!

These were really good and everyone loved them.  Only thing is that I couldn't find a way to use close to all the sugar the recipe calls for.  Also, the directions say baking sheet and the bacon grease all ran off and into my oven.  Would use baking dish and then let drain on paper towels next time.

Delicious! I made these for a party and they disappeared fast. Actually it was the only dish that completely disappeared. Thanks for the great recipe.

These have been a family favorite for years.  A friend used to make these for our Mom's group brunches.  I take them to a lot of potlucks.  We refer to them as "meat wrapped in meat"  They're amazing!  I sometimes wrap them with the bacon the night before and sprinkle just a little brown sugar on them.  I bake them for about half of the the time. Drain some of the fat off, add more brown sugar, then finish baking.

HUGE hit!  I have been wanting to make these for a long time, but needed a large enough crowd to make it worth it.  I made 90 of them for a party of 10 people, and they were gone quickly (even my bacon hating sister had a few-and liked them!).  Everyone refered to them as "meat wrapped in meat rolled in sugar" and we all loved it.  I put the brown sugar in a ziploc bag and tossed the bacon with it in there before rolling around the smokies and then sprinkled the leftover sugar on before baking.  YUM!

I've never made an appetizer that generated such "food lust". One taste, and people want more. Instead of serving with the brown sugar/bacon grease slurry, drain them, add to the crock pot, pour in 1-2 tablespoons of maple syrup, and stir. The flavor enhancement is incredible. Also, these get even better as they're warmed in the slow cooker.

If you haven't tried these your really missing something. Line your pan with non sticking alum foil. It will make clean up much easier. Fantastic.

This is a great tried and true recipe. The only thing I do different is to layer them in a crock pot with brown sugar. I let them cook on low.
I always get rave reviews!!

Excellent.  I served them Christmas morning.  I put them on a platter instead of a slow cooker, they disappeared quickly.  I didn't find this very time consuming.  I prepared these early in the morning and put them in the oven shortly before the guest were to arrive.  I will definitely make these again.  In fact, my grandmother asked for the recipe.

These turned out perfectly and disappeared within seconds after they were put out.  I was extra careful with prep after reading one review that said they turned into a greasy, sticky mess that had to be thrown away. To avoid this: I...
1) Blotted the Smokeys dry before wrapping them in bacon. 
2) Raised them on a small, disposable aluminum grill sheet to allow the grease drip off. I think this was a big part of perfect prep.
3) Set temp to 425 instead of 325. This served three purposes: they finished faster (25-30 min), cooked up a little crispier, and I was able to bake some crescent-roll wrapped smokies at the same time. IF YOU INCREASE TEMP HOLD OFF ON THE BROWN SUGAR. Sprinkle it on less than 5 minutes before you take them out of the oven so the sugar won't burn. 

They were PERFECT. I only made 20 this year, but after they disappeared so fast I'm making a few dozen next year.

Bacon. Cocktail wienie. Some brown sugar and BAZINGA! Awesomeness. A tip: add an sprinkle of cayenne pepper on top the wieners...will help balance out the sweet. You're welcome.

Made for the Superbowl against my hubby's wishes, but guess who ended up eating the majority!
Very tasty. I wasn't so sure about adding the brown sugar, so I dusted the smokies very lightly and they were a hit! Will make again.

yummy! My husband LOVED these. I cooked them at 325 for 25 min and then at 350 for 15 min after that. Kept wam in a crock pot and added maple syrup to the crock pot (just a little) to keep them moist!

These were a hit at my Super Bowl gathering.  My teenage son and nephew helped make these.  No toothpicks needed.  I cut the bacon in half.  I bought both cocktail wieners and beef smokies.  Both are delicious. Be sure to put foil and place on baking sheet for easy clean up.

So good!  I used a pair of scissors to cut the bacon to make quick work of it.  They made a nice straight cut and I got 4 smokies per piece of bacon.

I made these for my family's Christmas Eve party last year, and they were gone in minutes. I was asked to make them again this year. I only cut the bacon in half, and dredge both the smoky and the bacon in brown sugar, then wrap the smoky and stick a toothpick through. When all are wrapped, I put them all in a ziploc with any remaining sugar or any syrup that was made while they were being prepared and let them marinade in the refrigerator all night. Then an hour before I need them I put them on a foil lined baking sheet and sprinkle them with more brown sugar. I bake them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, then take them out and flip them over and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Then I put them in the crock pot. I add 1/4 cup pancake syrup to the sugary stuff in the pan and pour that over the smokies in the crock pot. Then when I get to the party, I keep the crock pot on low until they're gone. *** Small Update: I got a George Foreman grill for Christmas. We had some of these left over this year. My husband took them and put them on the George Foreman to heat them up yesterday, and it just slightly caramelized the sugars and gave them a wonderful taste and texture. We will definitely remember that when it's time to make them next year!

I make these for most of my parties.  Everyone loves them. I do it a bit different though, I put them in the crockpot. I use a whole pound of bacon, cut in half, and wrap each smokie. Loosely pack in the crockpot, pour an entire 1 lb box of brown sugar on top and cook on low for 8 hours.  Use long bamboo skewers and serve right out of the crockpot.  Sooooooooo easy and soooooooooo gooooooooooood!!

I made these a couple months ago for a halloween party. They were the first item gone.  People couldn't get enough of them.  Just the other day I got another call from a friend who wanted the recipe.  I did as recipe suggested but also rolled smokies in brown sugar before wrapping them and I broiled them for a few minutes when cooking time was done so they would be crispier.  Then I just threw them in a crockpot.

After reading the reviews for these smokies I had to try it and I made them for a Christmas party. Well let me just say "WOW!" They were the first appetizer gone and thank God I made double the recipe. They were a huge hit and everyone wanted to know how I made them. I used maple flavored bacon and cut the bacon in fourths instead of thirds, and made sure I coated them well with sugar and then 10 minutes before they were done I took them out of the oven and tossed them a bit to turn them over to let the other sides get crispy. I didn't put them in a crock pot, I just cooked them in a disposible foil tray and served them right from the tray. They were gone so fast... Thanks for a great recipe. I know I will be making these again and again...

Forget putting these in a slow cooker to stay warm!  I couldn't make them fast enough last new year's!  My husband--we'll drink our lunch while we watch the game--ate a platter of them alone!  What's better than meat wrapped with meat?!?

I have been making these for several years now and just realized I never rated the recipe! These are fantastic. People ask me to make them for every potluck. One tip I have is use Oscar Mayer bacon. When I have used another brand I have been disappointed. Something about that brand of bacon makes a difference when wrapping the smokies. The bacon is more moist and stretches easily to the point where you don't need toothpicks. I have customized this a bit even though they are delicious as prepared in the recipe. I drizzle the wrapped smokies with a little pure maple syrup after coating in brown sugar. I also serve with a dipping saice which is equal parts ketchup and brown sugar, a dash of soy saice and a little garlic and ginger powder. Enjoy!

I don't know what I can say that everyone hasn't already. These are going to be a regular addition to my appetizer recipes! I doubled and only had 3 men and 3 woman eating these and they were gone. I made on a Nordic Ware 1/2 sheet and put foil (that stuck - next time won't use anything) down to try to make clean up easier. Also I think a wire cooling rack - the waffle kind - is essential so that they don't get too greasy. I did assemble all the weenies / bacon and then put in a 2 gallon zip lock and poured brown sugar in and shook. No need to measure. Then put more on before baking. My baking time was longer and these do need to be flipped so that they are crispy all the way around. YUUUUUMMMM!

If I could give this 10 stars I would! Everyone loved these and I ran out! Here's a tip, if you dump your sugar on a paper plate, wrap your wieners with the raw bacon and spear them, you can use the toothpick to pat, roll etc it around in the sugar. The sugar will stick to the raw bacon, rather than trying to sprinkle it on, you'll get more sugar on and it will be closer to an equal amount on each one. Once you've done this and laid them out, sprinkle some more on them before baking and when they go into the crock pot dump the rest of the sugar on them. Do not use colored toothpicks the color will leave a small stain/run. The serving size is inaccurate on the recipe, the actual serving is closer to 8-10 instead of 16.

OMG! I had a kitchen full of men gathered round the oven waiting for these to come out! The reviewer who called these meat candy aptly named them. Using the ziplock bag method made this simple to do because the bacon just clung to the smokies without benefit of toothpicks.  The flavours were just perfect.  Hit of the bridal shower for a very bacon oriented crowd.

I didn't think anything would be too greasy for me, but these were.  I precooked the bacon a bit before wrapping them.  I should have used a rack or a broiling pan to keep the melting grease away from them.  I also should have cooked them longer to make the bacon crispier.  My husband likes undercooked bacon, so that is why I took them out when I did.  He also doesn't like the brown sugar, but that is just him.  Another mistake I made was that I cut the precooked bacon into quarters instead of thirds, and there wasn't enough to surround the sausage.  I might try this again when we have people over, but I was trying to test it first.

Tasted real good but bacon remained soft. Don't eat too many, all the grease is a bit much for the stomach.

DE-LISH! My sister complained that I wasn't making the traditional lil smokies in BBQ sauce and then apologized because these were so much better!  However, my mom made these the next day and hers were not as tasty due to the brand of little smokies.  We do not suggest John Morrell Brand...they just taste like hot dogs!

Very tasty, but not for those watching their waistlines. I used low sodium bacon.  I would probably precook the bacon a bit beforehand so that it crisps up better in the oven without splitting the sausages

Crowd pleaser, and asking for more!   As my friend called it a cholesteral busting appetizer, but worth it.  I followed the recipe, but after I put in my crock pot and drizzled it with chili sauce.  It gave it a kick and was yummy.  The extra sauce made it even better when it carmalized with the brown sugar. This is a keeper. Thanks

These are great appetizers. For something a little different, try mixing 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder or cayenne pepper with the brown sugar then coating the lil smokies. It adds a tasty little kick!

This was really good, but I don't know if it was "worth the trouble" good.  Two things I did to cut back on the grease factor that I don't think anyone has mentioned. One, with little smokies I've ALWAYS boiled those before putting in any type of sauce, and boiled them for this recipe as well - you'd be amazed how much grease boils out.  Two, on the bacon, I partially cooked it in the microwave (between sheets of paper towels) to speed the cooking process and cut back on some of the grease. As others recommended, I tossed the smokies in a ziplock bag with the brown sugar, and also dredged the bacon in the brown sugar.
All the guys loved it!

These were the first thing gone at our party the other night. I didn't wrap the smokies first because I didn't want the toothpicks to be sticky with brown sugar so I put some brown sugar in a baking dish and pressed the bacon down turned over and pressed it down again and stacked in a pile. After I had all the bacon sugar coated I cut it into 3rds then wrapped each smokie then went back and put toothpicks in each one. I put them in the fridge till company go here and then baked them. Someone said use a broiler pan so they are not baking in grease but I used a cooling rack and put it inside my cookie pan so they weren't sitting in grease. Thanks for this recipe I am sure I will make these again and again.

These were not difficult at all.  I recently made them for our family Christmas gathering.  They were the first appetizer to "disappear."  I will bake them at 350 degrees next time though.

Not time consuming AT ALL! These powerful artery clogging appetizers are delicious and super easy. I followed the recipe as written but lined my pan with parchment paper and it was NOT enough!! I should have used aluminum foil and enough to cover the pan up really well. I was thinking about the caramelized sugar but didn't consider all the bacon grease and therefore the pan was hard to clean up. They dissapeared quickly even though i told people they are called "mini heart attacks". Watch them closely or the sugar will burn and give a bad taste to them. Enjoy!

I took the suggestion of lining the pan with foil before baking to make for an easy clean-up and precooking the bacon to ensure that it is crispy.  These are also great on the grill!  I serve them with different flavor mustards and barbecue sauce for dipping.

I used all the same ingredients, but I assembled them different.  I put the brown sugar on a plate, and I coated the bacon on both sides, then wrapped bacon around smokie. I threaded 7 smokies onto long skewers, which made turning a snap. I foil lined the pan, and also sprayed the foil, then put smokies on a rack (also sprayed) over the pan, no sticking at all. Clean up was a snap. I kept them warm by putting them in a glass 9x12 with 2 warming candles underneath. Some of the guests really liked them, and some thought they were OK. l personally like them.

For those who dig the pig this is hard to beat.  I take it easy on the brown sugar on top because too much makes the sweet overpower the salt/pork flavor.  My kids would have me make this every day if they could convince me to.

Everyone loved these for a football party. served with the dipping sauce on this site. They were gone within seconds. I sprinkled some brown sugar on my bacon before rolling so there was some on the inside as well.

My fiance says this is the best thing he has ever eaten! I used Turkey Lit'l Smokies, 1 cup of brown sugar, turned them 1/2 way through cooking, and put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end to get the bacon crispy (our preference).

Love these. One tip: rather than using toothpicks, I put about 5 of these on a wooden  skewer.  The skewers make turning at half time, much easier.  Be sure to soak the skewers first so they do not catch on fire.

These are pretty good. They do need some kind of dip with them- we tried dijon mustard, ranch and bbq sauce. Another reviewer suggested a creamy horseradish dip, which would probably be tasty. I found them to be very salty, which may be very obvious to most. You definitely don't want them to be the only snack you make, but as an addition to your football snack array, they're pretty good.

Perfect when you want to show off!  They are always welcomed with rave reviews.  I am sort of freakish about uncooked pork so I pre-cook the bacon a bit.  It made me feel safe.

A nice lil treat, with just the right amount of sweetness.  I cooked mine on 350 for 45 min, to get the bacon more crisp.  This is an easy and crowd pleasing appetizer!

These are gone within minutes every time I make them. My husband loves for me to make these for parties we go to and they are a must for our Superbowl party every year. I use Honey Maple Bacon that way it gives it a little more flavor. I also tried the Turkey Smokies last time and they were really good as well but have less fat and sodium than the other types.

How could hotdogs wrapped in bacon be anything less than 5 stars?!?  That's a no brainer.  However, it is important to get a good cut of bacon.  One time, I accidentally grabbed a package of bacon that ended up being pretty fatty and a lot of people were pulling the bacon off, and after the labor intensive prepping process, that was not what I wanted to see.  I think they are best with Hebrew National all beef hotdogs, cut into thirds.  Then I use Oscar Meyer Center Cut Hickory Smoked Bacon, cut in half is the perfect length to wrap around to put the toothpick through.

I have been making these for years and I never seem to have enough. I have dinner parties for my husband and his soldiers. The last time I made them we made over a hundred and gone in a blink. I cut the bacon in thirds, wrap little smokies, put the wrap side down in the pan. We them cover them with brown sugar and refrigerate over night. They get crispy in the over at 375 for about 15 minutes and serve with tooth pics. We are not allowed to have a party with out the.

Excellent! Served at a party and got many, many compliments on them. Was asked for recipe a few times. I rolled them all the night before and then cooked them two hours before party, put in a crock pot on "warm" and just served like that. They didn't get rubbery in the crock pot and stayed warm. I will be making these again and again!

I was so excited to make this because of all the raving reviews. My husband and I had guests over last night, and I decided to send my husband to the grocery store to get the smokies. He ended up getting pork instead of beef, but they turned out EXCELLENT! Everyone loved them and told me so, and they were gone in about 15 minutes. One suggestion -- make sure you line the pan with foil, and I mean the ENTIRE pan. I missed a couple spots, and bacon grease is now caked onto the pan. Other than that, AWESOME recipe. This will definitely be a family favorite.

I wouldn't normally make something like this but I had little smokies that I didn't use for a kid party so I decided to use them on New Years.  They were sooo good.  Very sinful but wonderful and easy.  I wrapped the smokies a few hours earlier and baked them right before guests came over.

This is a recipe I have used for a long time so when I saw it on here I thought I would rate it.  I do everything the same but add a bit more brown sugar and cook it for 50 minutes, turning the smokies have way through so the bacon gets crisp all around.  I make this for every get-together and always am asked to bring it to others.  Anyone who is trying it for the first time ALWAYS wants the recipe.

Very easy to make...You will need to double the recipe if you are making for a pot luck or a party...they go quickly. As a tip, When you are wrapping the weiners keep the bacon you aren't using in the fridge...the bacon wraps better when it is cold. After baking, I transferred these to a crock pot, added more brown sugar, and simmered for a couple hours until guests arrived. BE CAREFUL to spread sugar evenly and not to put too much in one area or else it will clump together and taste like you are eating candy.

This is a super easy appetizer!  I wrap these up the night before and stick them in the fridge.  For super easy clean up wrap your pan in foil, then just toss the mess when you're finished, it couldn't be easier!  This recipe is easily doubled and you just might want to, the first time I made these they were gone in minutes!

Did this for New Year's Eve, friends and I loved it!! I changed the recipe a little I mixed 1/4 real maple sugar  and 2/4 brown sugar It was delicious. ?? Maybe next time i'll put more maple ?? And I made a little mistake with the pan, didn't realize it would make grease and used a pizza pan.. not a good idea ??  I will definitely make this again!! ??

Yummy! 3/4 cup will seem like a lot of sugar, but they should be generously covered. I put them in for 30 minutes at 325, 10 minutes at 400, then 5 minutes at 425. I put them right in the crock pot with some brown sugar and let them caramelize on low. A little messy but very easy!

My father in law actually showed me this recipe a couple of years ago but we add crushed pecans to the brown sugar, dredge the bacon in sugar/pecan mixture and then roll around the smokie for baking. YUM!!

I wasn't impressed. The dish was good, but not worth the calories. I was expecting a flavor explosion, but wasn't wowed. Neither was my husband, though I will say there were no leftovers.

This is an amazing recipe. My husband LOVED them! We used all beef sausage cocktail smokies. I lined a baking sheet with foil and lightly sprayed with cooking spray. I soaked the toothpicks in water for a few minutes. Then I cut bacon in thirds and wrapped the smokies and secured with the toothpick. I lightly packed a bit of brown sugar on each one. 40 minutes on 350 degrees and they were great. You could probably turn the broiler on the last minute or two but don't leave unattended or the toothpicks may catch fire.  The brown sugar caramelized wonderfully. I will definitely be making these again!

I love this recipe I used it this thanksgiving and they were the first things to go! The only change I made was to wrap the smokies in the bacon the night before and sprinkle them with the brown sugar to marinade them and sprinkled a little extra on them before baking!

Amazing appetizer recipe!! Everyone loved them, there wasn't a bit left over. Just a tip, I found it easier to press the wrapped smokies in brown sugar instead of sprinkling over.

I know that I am in the minority, but I did not care for these at all. After taking the time to wrap each one and follow the directions to the "t", i found them too sweet and too "meaty" flavored, which is strange because i love bacon!  I would much rather make tangy meatballs if i ever needed a quick hot appetizer.

I have been making these for years for both large and small parties.  They are very easy to make.  Sometimes I add the toothpicks before cooking, other times afterwards.  Some of my parties are quite large so my recipe starts with 8lbs of bacon, and 8lbs of beef cocktail weiners.  Thats a lot of toothpicks!!! LOL

Super easy and delicious!  The first time I made them, I tried sprinkling the brown sugar on top, and after I baked them alot of the smokies had chunks of unmelted brown sugar.   So the next time I just dipped them in a bowl of brown sugar before I put them in the pan.

These were devoured by my husband and son during the superbowl.  I cut my bacon into quarters, didn't use toothpicks, and broiled for a couple of minutes at the end.  We put in slow cooker to keep warm along with the juices from the pan.  I'm sure I will be asked to make these again.

I have started making these a little more healthy.  I use turkey smokies, 1/3 less fat bacon and splenda brown sugar and they are amazing.  Definitely worth trying.

These are pretty good, you just have to make sure there's plenty of brown sugar because that sweetness is what makes these really good. My only complaint (which is expected from bacon) is just that the bacon doesn't crisp really like I like it, its kind of 'floppy' and fatty because its being baked and not fried. I know there's not much you can do to change it with this type of recipe though so I just pick away the really fatty pieces and the problem is solved.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  My uncle asks me to bring this every time we have a family get together.  I have baked them first and then put in my crock pot and I have also just put them in my crock pot and cooked on low for several hours.

Awesome awesome awesome! People will love these. ADJUSTMENTS: ADD APPLE BUTTER! I added about 3 heaping spoonfulls of the stuff to my brown sugar then smothered the bacon wrapped smokies in the stuff.... Holy God! They were AMAZING! Everyone at them up in literally minutes... I should have made two batches! Also, toothpicks are unnecessary if you place the rolls seam-down and pack them in a pan next to each other so there's not a lot of room to move. YUM YUM YUM.

Right on! I used 2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar & 2 tablespoon chili powder
mixed together & roll the smokies and bacon around in the mix and pin with a tooth pick.. this recipe also works for chicken breasts cut into cubes. the chili powder adds a nice flavor. just wrap your bacon around the chicken cubes!

So simple and so delicious. I made these for my Christmas party and there was a crowd around the plate. Even the people who were "full" kept eating more. I used dark brown sugar, marinated overnight in a bag, then sprinkled even more sugar on right before throwing in the oven. You really cant overdo it with sugar. This is my first time writing a review, they are THAT good. I will make this for every party I attend.

I add ground red Hatch chile to the brown sugar and then cook these on my smoker with hickory until the bacon is done. Cayenne works too. Amount is up to your tolerance for heat. The cayenne has a good bit more. I've also been known to heat a jar of jalapeno pepper jelly and drizzle it over these after they come off the smoker.

I love you JILL1018!!  These are the best things ever!!  My friend actually made these first at a party a couple of years ago and I could hardly take myself away from the buffet table so I stole your recipe from her.  I now make these for every party or event I have.  I make sure to make a double batch because my friend Anna eats about one batch all by herself.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.  It is so easy and I saw that someone said to use a ziploc bag for the brown sugar.  Such a good idea and I don't know why I didn't think of it.

Delicious!  I had to cook mine closer to an hour because I used thick bacon.  I just kept cooking until the bacon was crisp and not limp.

This is the simplest dish I've found that gets rave reviews every time we make it. Everyone wants the recipe and I'm timid to tell them it's only bacon and brown sugar. haha.

They were alright. i would have rather used the smokies for pigs in a blanket and the bacon for bacon and eggs. Wasn't a fave for our family.

I made these for the Super Bowl and they were gobbled up in less than 20 minutes.  What's not to like? Meat wrapped in meat covered in sugar - an easy-to-make sweet and savory combo.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and had just the right amount of bacon to cover the smokies.  If you're entertaining more than 6 or 7 people, double the recipe!

These were really good... I rolled the smokies in brown sugar before wrapping them in bacon. I alson put them on skewers after wrapping and put more brown sugar on after that. Flipped them half way after about 20 minutes and with the skewers if you put them on a baking sheet you can place them over the pan so they are not lying in the grease. All in all they were good and I will make them again.

Don't underestimate these!!! I almost did but I made them for a surprise party and I was SO upset that I didn't make more. While preparing for the party my best friend and I took a taste when they were fresh from the oven. OMG!!! Ridiculous!!! These are so good and there's no way to screw them up! As one reviewer said - the more brown sugar the better - I didn't have time to let them marinate, next time I'll give it a try I can't imagine them being more delicious and flavorful. I used center cut bacon - perfect! These are Sooooo addictive everyone at the party was fighting for the last one - lol - seriously!!! Give these a try you WILL NOT regret it!!!

Oh    My     God.  These are awesome.  I made them for my annual Blue Christmas Party and they went so fast that I had to turn the oven on half way thru the party and cook another batch!!  I made the dip to go with them from the recipe I found on here and people were talking about them weeks after the party.  These are so easy to make ahead of time and then bake.  I will DEFINITELY make these again.

Absolutely wonderful! I toss the smokies with brown sugar before wrapping them with bacon, and sprinkle them once again before baking. Bake them on a brolier pan and line the bottom pan with foil, works great to catch all the drippings! I usually cook the smokies a little longer than called for just to make sure the bacon is perfect....yum!!!

This is absolutely the BEST appetizer I have ever made. So simple and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked them a little bit longer (about 10 minutes) just to get them extra crispy. Thanks so much for sharing. This is a new favorite among family and friends.

Easy! After baking the Smokies in the oven, I put them in ceramic crock pot and leave the pot in the ref. for the day. Prior to leaving the house for the party, I add 1/4 cup of pancake syrup to the ceramic crock pot then heat the pot in microwave for 3 minutes. After heating the pot up, I head off for the party with the whole crock pot.

Excellent!  I add maple syrup when transferring to the slow cooker.  OMGosh.  THE. BEST. EVER.  Definitely use foil - that stuff can save lives.  Haha.  No need to change temperature in between as some reviewers suggested.  This is a no fuss appetizer that will go in seconds, trust me.

I've made these for snacks for the last 2 Thanksgivings...they don't last long enough to put them in a slow cooker!   I used the pork cocktail weiners this year & they didn't dry out as much as the beef and had a better flavor.  Also, upon suggestion of a review, I used center cut bacon...ensures more meat/less grease.  I set the bacon in the freezer for about 10 minutes before starting, took out 3 slices at a time & left the rest in the freezer while working. Last year I used a baggie to put them in & let them sit in the brown sugar "sauce" all night, but the toothpicks poked holes in the baggie & made a mess, so this year I wrapped them all, put them in a small plastic storage container & put about half the sugar on top before I sealed it, letting the sugar/syrup drip down over the rest overnight.   Since oven space is limited on Thanksgiving, I cooked these in the toaster oven!  Wrap the drip pan in foil (learned this the hard way last year!) then lay out the smokies directly on the racks so they can drip down to the pan & don't sit in grease.  After arranging them on the racks, I sprinkle them with the remainder of the sugar & pop them in the toaster oven.  I set it for 350 bake & just watched to see when the bacon got done.  I wrapped them all in foil to keep them warm, but like I said, they didn't last long enough to worry about keeping them warm!  I think I'll make a double batch for Christmas!

edit
I'm still making these for Thanksgiving snacks but over the years hav

I have been cooking these for years. I put them in a crockpot. The grease from the bacon melts the brown sugar and makes a "gravy". Try it this way. They are wonderful. People beg me to make this everytime I go to a party.

Delicious, salty, and a favorite at my party.  They needed to cook twice as long for me though so the bacon was not clear or rubbery.

I like to call this recipe "Meat Candy" when people ask what it is.  I find that a 16 oz pack of weiners works perfectly with a full pound of bacon.

Very good. Followed other reviews and pressed the brown sugar into the bacon. Cut the bacon into 3 pieces, perfect size for smokies. When transfered to crock pot, I added 1/4 cup of cola to keep moist....it glazed and was very tasty!

I can't say enough good things about these! Just hosted a party and almost everyone asked for the recipe. Followed another reviewer's advice and cooked at 325 for the first 25 minutes and 350 for 20. So yummy, will be making more soon!

I made these for my sons wedding reception. I added a slice of jalapeno between the lil smokie and the brown sugar bacon. They are wonderful. This recipe has so many things you can change in it. Pineapple chunks, spiced nuts, on and on this list goes. Like stated before.. worth it!!

The way this appetizer disappears is unbelievable! I was doubtful, because those cocktail sausages really aren't something I'd normally make or eat, but everybody LOVED them, and they were gone in about 8 minutes. If you plan on making these for a party or get together, go ahead and double the recipe; one package of sausages will not be enough. I found that the bacon handeled easier as it warmed up, not cold as the recipe suggested. I did not use toothpicks, the 1/3 slice of bacon wrapped around and sealed itself. I did not have time to "marinate" the meat in the brown sugar (but they were fine anyway). I just put the sausages in a bag with the brown sugar which didn't coat very well, but kind of made the sugar a paste from the juice which may have helped the bacon stick. After I had wrapped the bacon around the sausage, I rolled it in the brown sugar. They came out great. I only used maybe 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, and they were still really good, but I don't think 3/4 cup would be excessive. I cooked them at a higher temperature, 400 for about 15-20 minutes, and the bacon was fully cooked and crisp on top. I also made the horseradish dill sauce to go with it (Oct.28 2006 review by Echomoon); it was fabulous and balanced the sweetness nicely. The simplicty of this dish leads you to underestimate it- don't. It will be huge wherever you take it, and everyone will rave about what a great appetizer you brought.

Yet another "loved it!" review - esp from the men in attendance : ) Used 3 packs of the smokies, cut bacon into fourths using kitchen "scissors" (cut lengthwise then widthwise, usually 4 pieces at a time.) Wrapped them up, toothpick'ed them, baked on a foil-lined baking sheet (turned them once) and transferred to crockpot to keep warm - served with spicy brown mustard on the side. Hubby kept giving me dirty looks as he was going back for repeat visits to the crockpot (as if it was my fault he couldn't stop eating them...!)(update 10/08 - I now cut the bacon simply in fourths, wrap, toothpick, stir in a big bowl with brown sugar to coat, cook/broil on greased foil lined cookie sheet to brown, turning them so they are evenly cooked - move to a sprayed crockpot and call them "Evil Weenies" : )- a double recipe got inhaled so quickly at the last party I took them to, I thought someone took them OUT of the crockpot and moved them!

These were a hit.  The first two trays I baked on the middle shelf in my oven and they burnt slightly on the bottoms.  The brown sugar turned into black rock so I had no sauce for those.  The next two trays I did on the top shelf and they came out perfectly.  To make up for the sauce I lost, I added some more brown sugar to the grease left in the pan and blended it well with a fork- stuck it back in the oven till bubbly and pour it all over the wienies.  DELISH!

WOW these are really good! You can even make these using beef smokies wrapped with turkey bacon! One piece of advice: To save the bottom of your oven and for easy clean up,  use foil lining creating a small edge to keep any grease and brown sugar drippings where it needs to stay!

These are awesome!!! I've made them a few times now, and agree that it's easier to cut the bacon with scissors after you have a good overlap. I can get 4 smokies done with one peice of bacon.  Also, I found that using cheap bacon works better than the thick cut, and definately shake the smokies in the brown sugar rather than a sprinkle on the top. After all, who ever heard of "too much of a good thing?"
My 13-year old is whipping up a double batch tonight for her youth group meeting. I'm sure she'll get nothing but compliments. Thanks for the recipe!

We didn't really care for these.  My husband didn't like the brown sugar glaze, and I didn't really find the idea of eating a greasy smokie wrapped in greasy bacon, very appealing.  I really wanted to like them, which is why I made them.  But I suppose I should have thought ahead a bit and should have known these wouldn't be for our tastes.  To each his own, I suppose.  Thanks for the recipe anyway.

I tried these at my neighbors house and have to admit, they didn't last very long.  I made them recently and everyone devoured them in no time.  I did cut off some of the white fatty part of the bacon first.  Other than that, followed directions to the letter.  Mmmm - bacon!

These were good, and popular with my party guests.  My brown sugar did not seem to melt into a gooey mess like others commented, and the bacon was not cooked sufficiently after just the oven, but a couple hours on low in the crockpot crisped it up nicely.  This is certainly not for anyone health conscious ... someone called it "pig in a pig"!

Everyone loves these.  Used only enough bacon to wrap the sausage once, with a little extra for the toothpick to hold.  The smell is wonderful as these bake.

I had to change the foil under it midway through cooking b/c the sugar was burning and you HAVE to use a broiler pan or the bacon will stay soggy. It tastes pretty good but not so amazing that it's worth all the work. Sorry, will not be making again.

These should be renamed "Heart Attacks in the shape of lil Weenies!"  But wow are they tastey!  Very time consuming to wrap and you have to really watch them if you oven is fast cooking b/c they burn easily.

These are excellent.  I agree with using the little smokies and cutting the bacon in thirds.  Be sure to put plenty of brown sugar on them.  If you don't line the pan with foil, you will regret it!

For best results, I recommend putting these in the broiler for 2-3 minutes per side. Make sure to keep an eye on them, as they burn easily.

This saved the day when unexpected guests arrived (including young children. 4 and 5 years old)  I didn't have Smokies so I cut hot dogs in thirds and wrapped them. Worked out great.  They are now requested whenever these friends visit.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I also make the creamy horseradish dip "echomoon" suggests and it makes it the most amazing indulgent treat ever. I feel like the fattest fat girl when I eat it but it's soooo worth it. And the reason I save it for special occasions ;)

This was okay and some people at the party I took it to enjoyed it. Followed the recipe as stated, but the cook time was off as the bacon needed a bit longer to cook. I personally prefer the bacon wrapped water chestnuts...but this was simple to make.

After placing the wrapped dogs in a baking dish, drizzle bourbon over the dogs then maple syurp followed with sprinkled brown sugar. Bake until bacon starts to crisp.

These were pretty good.  I prepared mine the night before and placed them in a zip lock bag.  By the next morning, the brown sugar had all liquified, and they were "swimming" in a sugary sauce.  I think this gave them a better flavour.  Everyone enjoyed them.

HUGE HIT at my daughter's birthday party! Good tips I got from other reviews:
-Cut bacon in 1/3rd's
-Precook bacon partially 
-Sprinkle GENEROUSLY with brown sugar
-after cooked- put in crock pot for keeping warm & serving (I personally heated the crock pot up & then unplugged it to put it out on the table at party time)... kept them yummy & warm.
HUGE hit! Will definitely do them again :)

Followed other reviews advice and used center cut bacon and put the brown sugar in a ziplock bag. I also lined my cookie sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean up. 

It was better to cut bacon into 1/3rds and put a toothpick thru it. Cooked in oven flipping midway, once they were cooked I pulled them off the toothpick and put them into small crockpot. 

I added ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, a little sugar and apple cider vinegar and some Fat Tire beer, I ended up using a dash of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. 

When they were heated thru I stuck toothpicks thru them to serve. Everyone thought they were great!

These were good.  I didn't bother with the toothpicks.  They stayed together fine without them.  I made sure the bacon was very cold for better handling. Reading other reviews I was afraid they'd be too sweet so I made some without the brown sugar.  I think the ones with the sweet crust were much better than the plain ones.  But I love bacon so I'm not complaining.

I made these and put in an air-bake pan to  bake.  325 is not hot enough, they were not done in 45 min and were not getting crisp, so I put under the broiler.  Then you really have to watch or they burn.
I also would not put the brown sugar on ahead of time, or it dissolves and goes to the bottom of the pan.  I may try again with these changes.  Otherwise they were fatty and undercooked.

My family loved these so much at Thanksgiving I had to bring them again on Christmas. Now I have been told I can't come to the holiday gathering without them!

These are so easy to make and everyone loved them. I made the dipping sauce for them.  It was excellant for the smokies as well as everything else! Will make again and again.

How can something this easy, be so good?  I made this recipe today as an appetizer for our Christmas dinner.  I have two teenaged boys that would have rather eaten these than the planned meal.  I used the zip-lock idea I read in one of the reviews, and it may have taken a bit longer, but the result was perfect!  Thanks for sharing!

These are great!  A huge hit at our Christmas dinner.  Cut bacon in thirds and just follow the directions from there.  The men really go for these.

Not so much. Maybe this was a poor decision on my part, however I found this to be very greasy. The combination of the two should have been an indicator that this would be oily and it was. If you do not mind extremely greasy foods, this is an excellent recipe.

These are a favorite at my house.  We call them Pork Candy  (which gets some strange looks until they try them!).  I bake them at a lower heat for a longer time (maybe 2-3 hrs).

I made these bacon wrapped smokies today. They are delicious. I used dark brown sugar and needed to bake them 10 minutes longer then the recipe suggested. I will make them again.thankyou for this recipe. In addition the next time I made them, I kicked the temperature up to 425 that crisps up the bacon and baking time is decreased to just 20 minutes.

Made these today, they were very good.  I'm having hard time leaving a few for my kids.  Didnt change anythything.   Used center cut bacon, and tried putting the brown sugar in a bag to coat the bacon.  Worked OK but was kinda messy.

What can go wrong with bacon in it? I made these for my Mardi Gras party last year and honestly, I even burned them a little by accident, but they were all gone within the hour. This recipe made more than I thought, which turned out to be a good thing with all those smokie snatchers out there. Make sure you've forked the chunks out of the brown sugar and sift it onto the smokies with a bowl and a fork. All the clumps made for some extra-sugary smokies and also a lot of waste. Make sure to use tin foil on the pan.

Good recipe, but I found there wasn't to much flavor from the brown sugar. I also cooked mine at 250 for an hour and it turned out great for me, they weren't to crispbread or to flabby.

Winner!  I wasn't sure if my husband would like this because he may have thought it was too sweet with the sugar and bacon.  He likes plain meals without sauces and gravies.  So I used 1/2 pkg of Lil Smokies for this recipe and 1/2 pkg for just plain boiled smokies.  The bacon wrapped smokies were gone in a flash.  He absolutely loved them.  I'll never make them any other way.  Outstanding!

I had to try this because it got 5 stars and had such few ingrediets and what a plesant surprise.  We brought this to a family party and people made fun of it saying it was so unhealthy but, once people tried them they were gone.  Pork fat and sugar... how could they not be delicious.

I took these smokies to my Sister In Laws as an appetiser for Thansgiving and they loved them! I didnt find this recipe to be time consuming but next time I will definetly dip the bacon in the brown sugar before wrapping. Cant wait to make them again as something fun for the tailgate party!

These were a huge hit--first thing gone at a potluck!! I just cut the bacon in half then placed the bacon in a bowl full of brown sugar and rolled the smokies in the bacon in that bowl. Let them sit overnight then baked at 375 for about 45 minutes. I didn't have to drain the fat from the pan to get my bacon crisp--but I used pretty thin bacon. Also, if you forget about them and they get a little blackness to them (because you decide you're in a hurry and turn the oven to broil)--these will still be okay, in fact, most guests liked the blackened ones the best. I won't make these all the time since they aren't healthy, but I think I'll take them to more parties in the future :)

We wanted something different from our standard crescent roll wrapped smokies and these were great!  I cut the bacon in thirds, wrapped and placed in a 13x9 baking dish w/out the toothpicks.  Covered with brown sugar and baked @ 350.  Transferred to another dish and saved some of the drippings which was not needed  Very good and will definetly make again.

Oh my goodness, these are amazing!  I already made them twice since I found this recipe last week.  Definitely not a health food, but they are so so delicious!!

I must admit I was hesitating on making these when I viewed the photos! Some looked very greasy,some like the bacon would burn easily.So I thought I would try them my way following the original recipe.I fried my bacon a bit first to remove some fat..then wrapped them around the cocktail weiner,it worked for me. Then followeed the recipe accordingly,I did use some syrup as another viewer suggested. Thanks for a nice recipe,I did not find this recipe very time consuming.

These are consumed faster than the time it takes to assemble them!  A crowd favorite! Place in crockpot and drizzle light maple syrup on top to serve.  Keep crockpot on low or warm.

A coworker introduced our office staff to these little gems - they are great.  She cut hotdogs in half and wraps the bacon around them and cooks them in the crockpot at work.  Her method is to alternate layers of the wrapped hotdogs and brown sugar and cook them on high in the crockpot.  She starts them around 8:00 am and they are done by noon.  It's a long, tormenting morning when you are smelling these little babies cooking and waiting for lunch.  We are all very thankful that she brings them to every office potluck.

Great recipe. Served with a side of honey mustard. I didnt add the brown sugar while baking bc i forgot. I only broiled then on both sides for a couple of min per side. I'll be making this again for sure.

These are soooooo good.  Now I'm stuck bringing them to EVERY function I attend.  You might try making these on a grated roasting pan so the drippings can fall below.  If not, you will have a dried fatty mess in about 40 minutes.  But they don't usually last that long!

As far as really bad for you, really tasty appetizers go this is 5 stars!  We really liked these.  I did cook these a little longer than stated just because we like crispy bacon.  Turned them half way through too so they would be crisp all over.  Thanks for the recipe.  Oh and I've never like 'lil smokies before these.  I actually made them for my husband and I ended up eating just as many as he did.  Yum.

My boyfriend requested these and dang near didn't leave any for the guests! Mine didn't turn out too pretty, but they sure tasted good. Especially tasty dipped in dijon mustard...yum! Next time I will definitely take the advice of putting them on a rack to bake; sitting in their own grease made for soggy bacon on the bottom of some of them.

This is absolutely perfect!!!!!I've been making these for years and found if you lined your pan with foil the clean up is so easy. You'll have no cooked on brown sugar to scrub off.

I have made these several times and everytime they turn out great. Make sure you line your pan with foil. If not, immediately after cooking soak your pan in hot soapy water. This is fabulous! It is a bit time consuming. Let me tell you though, well worth it. I did as another reviewer suggested and put brown sugar in a bag and coated several pieces of bacon and smokies at the same time. This seemed to coat it a lot better then just putting it on top. So, I used a lot more brown sugar than what it called for. I also used the little smokies with cheese in them. I was making them to take to a mom's group breakfast. I prepared them the night before and just put the pan in the frig and cooked them the next morn. I did have to go ahead and cook a few the night before, so I could taste test. My husband and I both loved them. He wanted me to bring any leftovers by his work. Too bad for him, there were no leftovers. All the Mom's loved them as well. Everyone wanted the recipe. Great Job!!!

These were easy to make and didn't take nearly the time stated. My bacon was half frozen and easy to work with. Not a huge hit but will keep the recipe to make again.

A really big hit at the Super Bowl Party and a nice change from the regular pigs in a blanket. I didn't find them at all time consuming -- I made them the night before (with toothpicks and without the brown sugar) and refrigerated until ready to cook.  I added the brown sugar right before cooking and added less than 3/4 cup called for (only because it seemed like it would be overly sweet) and it was still great!  Thanks!

I made this for game night (following recipe exactly) and it was gone instantly. Huge hit!
One question I do have is - did the recipe author use mini beef wieners or Lil' Smokies sausage? I used Lil' Smokies (with Oscar Meyer bacon) and it was very good. I might try wieners next time to see which is better - although it would be hard to beat what I made!

These were to die for!!! Wonderful! Be sure and use foil on your pan and be careful with the crockpot - keep them on low for too long and they'll start to carmelize into "sausage candies". If you have a warm setting, use that instead (although frankly, they probably won't last that long ...yum!)

Very tasty, super easy...although my sugar started to burn a bit and the ones that were burnt were hard and the carmelized sugar stuck to your teeth.  Definately have to watch them to make sure they don't overcook.

I've made this a couple times and found 1 little extra step. Lay the cut bacon out and pat a small amount of brown sugar on them before you wrap them around the smokies. The sugar will stay there  while cooking and gives a sweeter taste.

I've made these many times now and they're amazing! People are always requesting we bring this to parties and pot lucks. A few tips to make the process easier: 
I fill a deep baking dish with brown sugar, then dump in the smokies and mix with my hands. I usually just cut the bacon in half instead of thirds and this helps them stay together without toothpicks. I take a bacon half and roll it right in the pan with the smokies and sugar. This ensures that everything is completely dredged in sugar. Always line the cookie sheets with heavy duty foil! This will make clean up way easier. I also have a metal cooling rack that fits perfectly into the foil covered cookie sheet. I put the smokies ontop of the rack and it keeps them out of the grease. I usually cook for 40-45 minutes, then broil to crisp them up a bit. Make sure youre watching closely when your broil! Usually only takes about 3 minutes to brown them nicely. After taking them out of the oven I toss them in the slow cooker, sprinkle with a little more sugar, and put on warm. This makes them easy to transport and keeps them nice and warm. We NEVER have left overs!

This is a great recipe and takes so little time.  I followed the recipe but at the end put under the broiler on 'low' for about 3 minutes each side to make it more crispy.  This can be fixed the night before and added to the crock pot on warm a couple of hours before serving.  Love it!

I first tried the recipe and just sprinkled brown sugar on top. It was good but not sweet enough for me. The second time I put the brown sugar in the bacon before rolling it around the wieners and then sprinkled it on top of them as well. It was delicious. It was like bacon candy wrapped around smokies. It was amazing!

Made these for a Halloween party...they were a hit.  I will make them again.  One thing I suggest is to cook them on a cookie cooling rack.  It kept the brown sugar from burning on the bottom of the bacon wrapped smokey.  May need to cook them 5 minutes longer.

Made this recipe with some of the modifications suggested here.  Shook the smokies in the Ziploc bag filled with brown sugar, and placed them on a wire baking rack on top of the heavily foil-lined sheet to avoid a larger mess. Cooked at 325 for 25 mins, then 350 for 20 mins, and the bacon turned out perfectly.  They were a huge hit at my party and will definitely be on my go-to list.  (Also made the Outback sauce and it was great too.)

This recipe makes me want to use expletives and tell you how @?!#ing awesome these bacon wrapped smokies are.  I tend to find a recipe I love and stick with it for happy hours, holidays, etc...this recipe has been no different.  We call it "Meat Candy" and label it as such at every party.  These things are so addicting and delicious.  I cut the bacon into thirds, secure with toothpicks, throw them in a large ziplock and toss in the sugar.  Best  let them marinate as long as possible in a ziplock overnight and you will end up with a nice, thick sugary glaze you can baste with.  I put them in for 45 mins at 350 then jack it up to 375 for another 15.  If you can turn them once during cooking it helps.  Seriously - even if you burn these they are fracking awesome!!  Thanks so much!  Make a double batch, yo!

Took to a girls' night party and they disappeared within minutes. I lined my cookie sheets with tin foil, and sprayed the foil with Pam to prevent sticking. Worked like a charm and no cleanup!

I just made these, and they are hot out of the oven, yum! I used turkey little smokies to cut down a bit on the grease. I also nuked my bacon for 3 min before wrapping which decreased the size so I used half pieces of bacon instead of thirds, and poured the bacon drippings into the pan.

These were a huge hit at my party this weekend! As another person suggested, I lined my pans with aluminum foil, and that made cleanup a breeze. I made them before the party and served them cold, and then made another batch during the party, which I served warm, and people loved them both ways.

I actually wrap the wieners with the bacon and bake for 40 minutes until bacon is crispy.  Then put into crockpot.  In a small sauce pan I put 1 cup brown sugar and 1/4 c mustard (you can use what every variety of mustard you wish - had a friend make these with horseradish mustard - excellent) in a sauce pan and melt together.  Pour over wrapped wieners and enjoy!!

Tried this recipe for the first time for a party with friends and it was a big hit.  I read several reviews to get some ideas and I used center cut bacon and used it cold as recommended.  I used smoked cocktail wieners.  I cut the bacon in half and it worked out perfectly in numbers with the package (the bacon was 12 oz and the wieners were 12 oz as well).  Also one of the recommendations was to use heavy duty aluminum foil - completely agree because it does help with the clean up.  I will admit when it was time to put brown sugar on the wieners, I was afraid because it seemed like a lot but I followed the recipe.  I did double this recipe.  I baked it for 40 minutes at 325 but then baked it for another 15 minutes at 350 and it was PERFECT.  Placed them in a crockpot and they were a hit with everyone!!!  Thank you!!!

This is a great recipe, but there are a few changes that I would make...First, I think regular Little Smokies taste much better than the beef-flavored ones. Second, I think  it's best to pre-heat the oven to 350, as the bacon gets crispier and cooks more thoroughly. Third, I would definitely line the baking sheet with wax paper, as the sugar combined with grease is a nightmare to get off. Also, the little smokies stick to aluminum foil. Fourth, if you line the serving dish with wax paper as well, the little smokies have a less likely chance of sticking to the plate. Fifth, they are good rather they are warm or room temperature, so if you do not have a crock pot, no problem!!! These are great for football games or any other get-together!!!

EVERYONE loved these!  I was asked to bring them for every food related gathering we have from now on.  I think you can probably get away with cutting the bacon slices into quarters rather than thirds, to make it go a little further, make a few more weenies and still have plenty to wrap each one!

I drained them on paper towels after baking them to get the excess grease off of them.

This is a good recipe but I made with the the sausage that comes in a ring.  Cut into 1" pieces and wrap in bacon.

The rest of the recipe is the same.  DELICIOUS!!  we call it "meat candy"!!

I have made these for over 20 years.  A never fail recipe.  A less expensive way is I use wieners instead of smokies and just cut the wieners in thirds as do the bacon!

These were just ok...probably wouldn't make this again.  You really do have to watch or they'll burn.  I marinated them in the brown sugar overnight which dissolved quickly and pooled at one corner of the pan.  I found they really weren't too time consuming to prepare.

OMG so good, cooked for 40 minutes at 350 and then broiled for 5 minutes to get bacon crispy. Good idea to use foil on bottom of pan to help with clean up. Kids devoured them. Thanks for sharing

I wanted to like them but to me they were bland tasted like a hot dog wrapped in bacon, the brown sugar didn't do much for it - not worth the fat and calories!

Very good! the only thing I did different was I wrapped the smokies then sprinkled them with brown sugar in a ziploc container and tossed them lightly. I didn't measure the sugar though. I baked them on a broiler pan. When they were crispy, I poured a little maple syrup- apple cider- and molasses over them in the slow cooker and sprinkled a little more sugar on them.

We Love these! I was intorduced to this recipe at an appetizer party and my friend called it meat wrapped meat! No one could stop eating them! My version I use half or less of a piece of bacon per smokie so it browns quicker.

I've been making them for years (with Dark Brown sugar and maple flavored bacon) and they're ALWAYS requested. However, I never put toothpicks in them, you don't really need to. Just pack them together on the cookie sheet, and they stay wrapped after cooking. Just a tip to maybe save some time. sooo good!!

These were extremely easy to make and turned out fine.  I did use a broiling pan so the grease could drain and just sprinkled the sugar on top instead of coating to cut down on the sweetness.  They were still sweet, so I'm glad I cut back.  Overall, these were good but not great.  There really wasn't anything that interesting about them.  They just tasted like Lil' Smokies in brown sugar flavored bacon to me although I made two batches and they were both gone at the end of the night at the party but I assume because they were just easy to pop in your mouth.

A Sunday Football Favorite at our house.  I don't put quite as much brown sugar on them as they can get a little too sweet for some.  I usually do them ahead and put in refrigerator until ready to cook and then just op them in the crockpot to keep warm.

1/3 a piece of bacon is plenty to wrap these smokies with. The more the sugar the better, I added about 1/2 a cup more brown sugar to mine. These are the perfect appetizer for football or parties and everyone loves them. So easy so yummy!

I used center cut bacon cut into thirds, mixed brown sugar and smokies, wrapped it in bacon and let it marinate overnight.  Then cooked the next day for 325 for 40 minutes flipping halfway through, sprinkled more brown sugar and cooked for the rest of the time turning the temp up to 350 for the last 10 minutes to crisp bacon.  Put in crock pot with bottom lined in maple syrup for potluck, yum

This was a big hit at my recent appetizer party, I made multiple batches and they all disappeared within minutes. The slow cooker part was not necessary as they were eaten before they could cool down. Also, I had to turn the broiler on at the last few minutes to make them carmelized on top.

I have been making this recipe for years. I put brown sugar in a bowl with the bacon before I do anything else. By the time I get ready to put them together the bacon juice has combined with the sugar making a glaze. Gives the end product a really crunchy yet gooey coating. These are amazing and everyone I make them for just loves them

This is a must have for parties. The guys burn their tounges because they grab them as soon as they are out of the oven. I add some butter to help the brown sugar carmelize. Heart attack on a tooth pick but so good!

I cut a pound of bacon into thirds and then dip the bacon in brown sugar BEFORE wrapping the weinie.  I put any leftover brown sugar on top of the weinies.  Don't forget to foil the pan or you might as well toss it when you are done!!  SO good.  I have never met anyone who didn't like these...

OMG!  These are delicious.  I made these for a work potluck and they were the hit of the party.  Days later my coworkers were still thanking me for bringing them.  They will work for any type of party, don't wait for the holidays to make them!

I've known this recipe for many years and if you haven't tried it please do, it's wonderful. Thank you Jill for putting it on the website!! Here are some tips that I use when making these: 1) use half a bacon strip instead of a third, this way you get more tasty bacon and don't even need the toothpicks! 2) I go ahead and place mine on the slotted broiling pan (along with the bottom drip pan) that way the bacon grease drips down and they crisp up more easily! Just wait until they cool a bit and the sugar will caramelize and be oh so tasty!

These were great.  I almost didn't have enough.  Everyone ate them so fast.  I did broil for a few minutes at the end to crisp up the bacon.  Definitely a keeper.

I used home made italian sausage with home made bacon. A real hit. Didn't need maple syrup. Just sprinkled dark brown sugar and used drippings as the sauce in the crockpot. I also browned under the broiler for 3 minutes.  Very very good

These were sooooooooo good!  And a breeze to feed a crowd with.  They taste even better after cooling down a bit.  I made these for an appetizer on Thanksgiving but they never made it...we all picked on them.  My sister was a vegetarian and she just started eating certain meats again but not beef.  She came over and tried one which blew me away I was shocked.  What shocked me more is that she ate several.  If that doesn't tell you how tasty they were I don't know what will! My mom and I were saying that "I just can't stop eating them".

I love these for breakfast!  I also wrap bacon around chunks of pineapples.  Add in alternating rows. I used a baking dish instead of a baking sheet, because I have a lot of grease from the bacon.

No need to use toothpicks, just wrap the bacon tightly around the smokie and you are good to go. I added 1C. brown sugar and they tasted delicious. I did have to place them under the broiler to crisp up the bacon b/c the bacon was still raw after 40 minutes in the oven. Been getting emails all week for this recipe!

These were great!  Took some time to make, but well worth it.  Every smokey eaten at party!  I "dredged" the bacon in the brown sugar and then wrapped the smokies.  Then, added brown sugar on top.  Excellent.

Everyone loves these!  I baked at 325 for about 35mins and then at 350 for the last ten mins.  I made them for a house party so after I baked them I put them in a crock pot and poured about a 1/2C Maple Syrup over them.  Mmmmm soo good!  These are super easy to prep the night before!

I made the Tiger Dill Sauce submitted by Echomoon. It was great served with these tasty little Smokies. I used pineapple tidbits in each Smokie and bacon roll up. It added an extra kick. Friends ask for these each gathering. Keep the good appetisers coming!

So delicious!  My family does "cook-off" competitions and one month we had bacon.  I made these with a dipping sauce I found (1/2 cup mayo 1/2 cup bbq sauce 4 tbsp brown sugar)...and I WON the competition!

These were sooooo good. I doubled up the recipe and I think they lasted about 5 minutes at the party I went to. I think I'll quadruple the recipe next time! Instead of sprinkling the brown sugar I dredged the bacon in a pile of brown sugar while wrapping the smokies. That way each smokie was evenly coated. Very easy, and it really wasn't that time consuming.

These went over like WILDFIRE! Disappeared in no time at all. I've made several times, once I tried shaking the wrapped smokie in a ziploc with the brown sugar, coating the entire thing rather than just sprinkling over the top. The bottoms were burned and crusted with all the excess brown sugar.  I'm definitely sticking to the original recipe. I bake these on a jelly roll pan covered with parchment paper to prevent the sticking & they turn out perfect!

This recipe is outstanding. I have made them in the oven and on my grill. Be sure to use a grill safe pan or dish though. These delicous little wieners hardly make it off the grill before the pan is empty. A great apitizer to kick off any occasion.

I make this for parties all the time and people always ask for the recipe.  I have changed the prep slightly the more I've made it however: I only use thick sliced bacon since it seems to hold up better, and I dredge the bacon in the brown sugar before I wrap everything together so the flavors can mingle more.  Also, I bake them for 30 minutes at 375 since I like really crispy bacon.  Overall a very quick and delicious appetizer!

These were delcious and easy to make too. The bacon wrapping was a little tedious, but not horrible. I doubled the recipe and baked on a jelly roll pan. This was enough to fill up my crockpot.

We were SO looking forward to trying these.  I mean...you can't go wrong with bacon, sausages and brown sugar, right?  Eh, wrong.  I was hoping for that great salty/sweet combo, but all we got was the sweet part, with crunchy hard set brown sugar and UBER grease.  There are so many variables in making these, perhaps we just didn't have it 'right'.  I used our favorite bacon and some good smokies and this still went uneaten on New Years Eve.  Even my husband who eats anything only had 2 and walked away.  It was the only thing uneaten on our buffet for 50 people, so my husband and I weren't the ONLY ones who didn't like them.

i serve these every year at my office open house.  I am requested to give the recipe by several people each year.  I fix them exactly as the recipe reads.  I might add that bacon comes in 12 ounce packages nowadays and not a pound.  I usually double the recipe every time I fix them because they go quickly!!

Little smokies wrapped in bacon and left to soak in brown sugared bacon and smokie drippings...What could be better? Time consuming? Sure. Worth the effort? Absolutely. I rolled mine in brown sugar after wrapping in bacon.

I made this for our housewarming party (trying not to eat them before the guests showed up) and these were the only dish that was empty by the end of the night.  Like another rater said, they are time-consuming to prepare but so worth it!  The brown sugar combined with the maple bacon just right and the whole thing was fantastic!!  Will definately make again!

These are incredible!  Since I am "low carbing" it, these really satisfied my sweet tooth!  I used cajun bacon, and brown sugar Splenda.  The sweetness combined withe the spice was out of this world! I cut the bacon slices in half, and partially cooked them first.  Then I wrapped, sprinkled and baked.  Yum!!

Made these for a party.  They were gone in ten minutes of being placed on the table.  I followed as directed with one exception of mixing 1/2 can of regular coke with brown sugar and pouring over the the smokies before cooking.  This creates a very nice glaze.

These are wonderful for any potluck dinner.  We made a double batch an they were gone in less that 15 minutes.  Will defiantely make again.  Also they are super super easy.  I just sprinkled the brown sugar on top instead of rolling the smokies in it.

Just made these for yesterday's Super Bowl Party (go Giants!) for the first time.  Now I know why your recipe got a 5 star rating, Jill!  They were a big hit!!  I really didn't think they were that much work OR time consuming! Just cut the bacon and wrap 'em up in the smokies, how hard is that?! The bacon stayed wrapped up so  toothpicks were not necessary. I too, used a ziplock bag to evenly coat and sprinkled more on top. After cooking, I transfered to the crock pot to keep them warm. Definitely line pan with tin foil for easy clean up!!

I just finished making this recipe and was very diappointed. Besides being greasy(yes I did drain the grease off twice during baking), and most of the brown sugar didn't stay on. Sorry but I won't be making these again.

These were yummy, but they needed to cook a bit longer so that the bacon would be crispy.  Just keep an eye on them.  I served them with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Yummy!!  A hit with the hubby!

I made these for my last two parties and they were devoured!  My brother-in-law, who is a selective eater, loved these... that's says something!  My only change is that instead of just sprinkling the brown sugar on the bacon-wrapped smokies, I lightly sprayed them with cooking spray and put them in a gallon-sized Ziplock bag with brown sugar and shook the bag to coat.  Gives better coverage, and it makes cleanup easy.  Highly recommended!

These are a great little snacks and usually the first thing gone at our parties at work.  When I make them I put the brown sugar in a shallow dish and dip each side of the bacon in it patting it good so that it sticks before wrapping it around the smokies.  The brown sugar is distributed more evenly that way.  I usuallly have to cook mine a little longer to get the bacon crispy.  Make sure you keep an eye on them because of the sugar they burn easily.

Great concept!!  I skip the brown sugra, though, and instead brush on some barbecue sauce.  Also, if you're in a hurry, you can toss these under the broiler.

Definitely worth making.  I made this for a Ladies  party.  I wasn't sure it would go over well with the women (sausage and bacon), but I wanted to try the recipe anyway for something different.  It was the belle of the ball, everyone was laughing at how good they were and how they could not stay out of them.  I had made a ton and was sure I made too many.  Wrong again, they disappeared quickly.  Thank you for the recipe and other reviewers tips, which I followed what several others had said about brown sugar in the bag and additional maple syrup drizzled over.  Yum yum!

Wow! These were DELICIOUS! The idea of them sounded very unhealthy, but we ate every last one anyway. I'll just have to make them once or twice a year. ;-)  As suggested, I put the bacon pieces, smokies, & brown sugar in gallon-size ziplock bag. I did end up adding extra brown sugar because moisture from the smokies made the brown sugar liquidy and gooey.  The sugar coating stayed on better that way. (Next time I'll try patting the smokies dry with a paper towel first.) The toothpicks in the smokies made it a little difficult to make sure all sides were baked and made lots of tears in the foil. I was mainly concerned about the bacon being cooked thoroughly, so I put the smokies in the pan without the toothpicks & put the side with the bacon ends facing down.  I turned them with tongs when each side was done. I used regular sliced (thin) bacon. I stuck a toothpick in each one and served them.  They disappeared within a few minutes!  I saved 6 smokies for my son to try when he got home, but I had to hide them in the back of the refrigerator under bags of vegetables. Okay, so he ended up with only 5 smokies, but I couldn't resist!

I've made these a few different times.  The first couple of times I followed the recipe and sprinkled the brown sugar over the top, and they came out with the brown sugar burned on the bottom of the pan and the bacon limp on top.  Then I followed someone's suggestion to put the brown sugar in a ziplock and shake the bacon wrapped smokies in it...works like a charm!!

This was an awesome recipe.  And by all means, not at all time consuming!?  I wrapped an entire bag of smokies in less then 5 minutes.   My 4 year old was helping too, she thought it was lots of fun.  They were so easy, and tasty!  I will be making these again for sure.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Messy recipe but well worth it. I followed the suggestions of others: line the pan with foil, used additional brown sugar for the top, cook at 325 for the first 25 mins then increase temperature to 350 for last 10-15 mins. Prepared the Outback Tiger Dill Sauce for dipping.

Made it for baby shower at the office! I made 3 batches. I use turkey bacon instead. I found out, the smokies too watery if I put it straight into the zip lock, so I pat it dry with towels. I used darker brown sugar. Instead of rolling the smokies on sugar, I sprinkle it in inside layer of the bacon on roll the bacon in it. Then I sprinkle the balance...turn out great! I keep the juice separately, brounght to the office in slow cooker, heat it and put back the juice inside it....its gone in a minute! Next day, made for my hubby and he want a second bacth in few hours!

I made these for Christmas and New Years, great hit.  The grandkids did not leave the crock pot.  I did as other and tossed in a bag with sugar.  Make sure the smokies are dry.  Sprinkled remaining sugar on top. Lining the pan with foil is great tip.  Next time I will try the suggestion of another review to spray a cooling rack and place it on the foil.  Thank you

These are such a crowd pleaser (well, look at the ingredients!).They are extremely easy to make and don't require any utensils to serve, with the toothpick working for you.  Being a vegetarian, though I couldn't tell you how they taste!

I know with so many reviews it seems alittle redundant but this recipe really was awesom!! I made as directed, but drizzled a bit of honey over the brown sugar. These were so good that I barely made it out of the house with any left over to take to the poker party I was attending. The whole family loved them as did everyone at the party. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Delicious, easy, not time consuming at all.  Didn't even use the toothpicks, as they stayed together fine without them.  I used cheap-but-fairly-lean, thin bacon, which wrapped easily and crisped up well.

My 10- and 11-year old daughters begged to help, and were able to do the entire thing with very little help from me, other than removing them from the oven.  

I followed the advice of a reviewer and put the finished product in the Crock Pot, poured the juices over top and sprinkled more brown sugar.  

The reviewer who called these "meat candy" summed it up perfectly!

WOW! Not only good, but good for you! Okay, maybe they aren't that good for you, but man, are they good! I made these on Christmas eve for my family. Everyone loved them so much, I made them again for New Year's Eve, except I tripled the recipe, for about 10-12 people. They were gone FAST. I honestly think I could have made twice as many and they would have eaten them too. I did bake mine at 400 degrees, just because I like them a little crisper and carmelized.

These are so delicious! I was going to half the recipe because I didn't have that many people to feed, but I'm glad I decided to go ahead and make the whole batch! They were gone in no time flat! I served them with some spicy mustard for dipping, and the spice with the sweet of the brown sugar and the salt of the bacon and smokies was out of this world!! They really don't take that long to put together- it took me less than 10 minutes to roll them all up in the bacon. Try them- you'll be glad you did! (And so will your guests!)

Compliments abound with this recipe.  I've been making these for a couple of years, so I've developed several small changes to keep them fresh.

*These work well on a skewer and placed on a grill!  (Of course, to me, everything tastes better grilled)

*I often add something to the middle of the smokies such as sliced jalapenos or a piece of pineapple.  Adds a very nice sweetness or spice to them.

*Instead of brown sugar, I use a store bought teryaki marinade, and brush it over the smokies when the bacon is about done.  Can't do it too soon on the grill or it will burn.

I used the cheese-filled lil' smokies, only lightly dusted each smokie with brown sugar before rolling it in the bacon strip, and didn't need toothpicks to keep everything in place.  All came out well and I'll be sure to share this recipe with friends!  Thanks!

Everyone loved these at our Holiday party.  I found the bacon did not get crispy.  So i cut each piece into 4ths and still had enough to wrap the with but it didn't overlap very much and was able to cook well.

The boys LOVE these!  I ran out of bacon and just put the brown sugar on the rest of the smokies and they inhaled them.  I cooked them first then threw them in the crock pot for the night and they were excellent!

These were a bit time consuming, but got rave reviews at the party. I did not use the full amount of brown sugar though; they would've been much too sweet. I cut back from the 3/4 cup that was called for to just 1/4 cup. Everyone loved them.

Made these for a family get together on New Year's Day. They were a hit! I made a double batch and they were gone-the only dish there that was completly eaten. Got lots of raves! They were fun to assemble as well as to eat!

I just made this for a late snack.  I really just wanted to try it and my family ate almost the whole thing.  My husband and 6 year old are super picky and they LOVED it.  Go figure.  I did put it on a low broil to crisp up the bacon because we like it super crispy.  I will be making this again.

These are the best...I make them for a lot of my gatherings and they are easy to make...I always have one or two people ask for the recipe and there are never any left.  Look for smokies on sale and keep them in your freezer they are a great snack for impromtu gatherings as well.

I've been making these for 20 years now.  I just throw them in a large deep baking dish, stir them through cooking a few times.  So much less time consuming in the cooking this way.  I don't even have to measure the sugar this way.  In fact the more sugar the better!

These were the first to be gone at the party! They are delicious!  I read some of the reviews and I tried a broiler pan and a cookie rack on a jelly roll pan.  This is the method that turned out the best for me. First :  I cut the center cut bacon into thirds and put it in a zip lock bag with brown sugar. Then I put the little smokies in a different zip lock bag with brown sugar. I put both bags in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  I covered the jelly roll pan with foil and sprayed the rack with Pam. I put the rack in the foil lined pan.
Assembly:  I rolled each sugared sausage with one piece of sugared bacon. I  put them close together on the rack, but not touching.  I placed them seam side down and didn't need toothpicks. I poured the brown sugar marinade they made over all.
Baking:  I  baked them in a preheated 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes.  On the rack , I didnt need to turn them. The bacon was done and not greasy. If you want them very crunchy, bake them for 40 to 45 minutes.   The bacon and the sausage  turned dark though.

I made this for our Christmas Eve snack and everyone loved it. I made everything the day before including popping them in the oven to bake.  The next day I just threw them in the crockpot and away we went.

Made no changes to recipe but did kick up temp 15° to take 5 to 10 min off cook time.   Was amazing!!!  Would have taken pictures but they didn't last long enough.   AMAZING!!!  Will drizzle maple syrup on them before brown sugar next time for added flavor.

I made these for a potluck, and everyone raved about them. I used maple bacon and dredged the bacon and the mini hotdogs in brown sugar before assembling like other reviewers suggested. I did not use toothpicks. I prepped everything the night before. The brown sugar liquified in the refrigerator over night, so I just sprinkled more on top. I baked them for 40 minutes at the recommended temperature and then put them in a slow cooker with a half cup of maple syrup. These are practically foolproof.

Strong mixed reviews from my house on this one.  When I saw they were floating in bacon grease, I moved them to a wire rack over a baking sheet.  (I am a crispy bacon lover).  I cooked them an additional 10 min on the wire rack, then I turned each one over and cooked them another 6 min.  My husband thinks they are great.  I was not so impressed.  The bacon still was not crispy, and they were very salty.

I made these for a party much to the dismay of my "eat healthy" wife who was horrified by the ingredients. But even she had to admit that they were "pretty good" which is a huge compliment. I thought the guys would be the ones that went to town on these, but the ladies ate more than their fair share. I'd make them again, but would do as others suggested: Dredge the bacon in the brown sugar, wrap the Smokies, and let them marinate together for a few hours or overnight. I found it a little difficult to coat them once they were put together, so dredging the bacon first should fix this.

My grandmother used to make these and they have become a traditional appetizer in our home for every occasion. I once did not make them, had real fancy appetizers instead...everone was disappointed. I use different kinds of sausages and that's about the only variation accepted...besides adding a bit of mapke syrup.

I have made these many times and they're always wonderful. I'm a little confused as to what takes 45 mins for prepping though and I'm a super slow cook.  I simply cut the bacon, wrap each cocktail wiener sprinkle a lot with brown sugar and then drizzle with maple syrup.

I don't even use the toothpicks as if you roll them and place bacon seam side down they work out great!

Exactly what I was looking for! Used hillshire farms beef smokies and classic cut bacon. Followed the simple directions and didn't even open the oven to peak. What I love is that the brown sugar is to taste so half the smokies got a coating of the sugar and the other half got none and I like it both ways. Some had a beautiful crunchy coating on bottom and some were more of a glaze. Loved them all. On a side note, I don't even like bacon really and this was for my family as an appetizer while waiting for Easter supper. BUT give me bacon this way and I might just change my whole outlook on bacon! I did eat quite a few.

This was a great party treat! They were gone  within the first quarter of the game! The directions are flawless. However, I made half with brown sugar and the other half with a 'Kona Coast'  pineapple & teriyaki glaze. When they were finished I drained all the oil and juices and then broiled them for a brief time to get them slightly crispy on top! Awesome!

I made these exactly according to recipe. Way too salty. What brand of Little Smokies have you used?  
It was not the bacon.

This is a party favorite around my home. Center cut bacon works best from my experience and I also drizzle some maple syrup on top lightly after sprinkling the brown sugar. So good!!

Good recipe only thing I did different was made a glaze instead of just putting brown sugar over them. I took alot of brown sugar, some butter and a bit of bbq put it in the microwave stirred it and poured the glaze over the bacon wrapped wrapped smokies right before putting it in the over. Also the whole process actually didnt take as long as an hour and a half. So great recipe.

A big hit.  Everybody will love these lil piggy bites.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and let the brown sugar and bacon marinate in a bag in the fridge, then I wrapped them.  This got rid of most of the bacon fat, as the sugar separates that... but it still had a very rich taste.  Maybe next time I'll try it with the extra fat though!  :)

Made this for a group of 8 last night, and doubled the recipe. I also made a double batch of the "Tiger Dill Sauce" mentioned in one of the other reviews for dipping. No leftovers and everybody loved it! Thanks for a easy, delicious recipe!

These were a big hit at Thanksgiving!  Keep them in the oven until just the bacon is just a tiny bit crispy and YUM!  We heated a little barbeque sauce as a dip, and I can say is there were definitely NO leftovers.

I would describe these as scrumptious lil bites of meat. It was a tad frustrating trying to find a good way to get the brown sugar on the wrapped smokies, since you can't sprinkle brown sugar well. After lots of trial and error, dipping the wrapped smokies into a bowl of brown sugar then lightly padding the brown sugar onto them was the best way to get an even coat of sugar around the entire smoky. I also suggest to not over-do-it with the brown sugar, since too much on the pan may spill over in your oven.

Like everyone else, I thought these were delish. I cooked at 350 for 50 minutes then broiled on high for 5 mins to get the bacon crisp. It was slightly too long and burned the bacon just a bit; next time I will only broil for 2 or 3 mins. I only made these for my hubby and myself so just poured some warm syrup over them instead of sticking in a crock pot -- awesome recipe!

Made for a wedding reception for 70 people.  These were delicious.  I did cut the bacon into 1/3's which worked out beautifully.  I would definitely try to wrap before hand and then freeze as someone else suggested.  Be liberal with the sugar-- it is what makes it good!

I have been using this recipe for many years, taking it to our family Christmas Eve, and special occasions. I'm not allowed in the door if I don't have them with me! This is so good, and so easy, just be sure to double the amount at least once to insure you have enough!!

Nice poppers!  I used turkey bacon instead of pork. Dunked the smokies into the brown sugar then wrapped 1/3 of the bacon around it.  Sprinkled leftover brown sugar on the top. On a skewer these cooked pretty fast in the oven.  Had a nice glaze to them too!

I've made these a number of times and there's never any left. The bacon can be a pain to cut in thirds and still wrap, sometimes I use a half or more than a third and use the remnants to make Franken-meat-candies.

THIS IS SO HEAVENLY AND DELICIOUS!! I had to type in caps! It was my first time making it and it was really easy to make! I followed this whole recipe (and I used light brown sugar) except for the toothpicks. They were really not needed unless its food finger.

Easy and good! What's better than that? I just tossed all the smokies in a bowl after wrapping them. Topping each layer with a sprinkling of brown sugar. I put them in the fridge to soak up the sugar overnight. The next day, I spread them out on baking pans (single layer) baked at 375 for about 20 mins. Some of the real fatty ones, I cooked a little longer. Tossed in crockpot and off to the party I went! GREAT Recipe! 

For those that want this a little healthier:  I had more smokies, than bacon... tossed those in naked and Wow... they tasted just as good!

Made these for New Year's Day.  Super simple and so delicious; no one could leave them alone.  Easy recipe to follow.  Gave them a quick stir couple of times during the baking process so that the bacon had a chance to get good and crisp.  Brown sugar carmelized nicely.  As far as the kids were concerned, we could have done another pkg of smokies, and skipped the main course!!  A very definite keeper!!  Thanks so much for sharing this one!!

I have made these wrapped smokies for years and get rave reviews each time. These little smokies are simply addictive, and a must at my house whenever there are guests.  (I prefer beef smokies). These are a must try!

I made this for Christmas.  Everyone gathered around my crockpot and the conversations went totally silent.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  You should be able to get 3-4 little smokies per bacon slice depending on your bacon.  Wrap them tightly and overlap them piercing throught the two ends to ensure that they don't come undone.  I had 2 unwrap in about 2 pounds of little smokies.

These were very good, and easy to make! I used lower sodium bacon to try and cut back on the salt factor, but they were still pretty salty. I took them to a party and everyone seemed to enjoy them.

So good!!!! You might as well make a double batch because they will be gone immediately! I followed another reviewer's tip and put the brown sugar in a ziploc then tossed a few pieces of bacon at a time. I baked at 350 for 45 minutes and they came out perfect. Def going in my recipe box!

Made these for a party...had 50+ guests and they didn't stand a chance!  I got requests for more and i made and wrapped 2 big packs of the smokies....I thought I OVER made!   Definitely a hit and must have...like others have mentioned, very time consuming...I made mine a week in advance, set in my crockpot dish (removed and in the fridge) for the week, with the sugar...it made it all carmeley and gooey...then I added more..heated them in the crockpot come party time, then I put even more sugar on them, and broiled them...OUTSTANDING...unfortunately I wouldn't know, I don't eat pork, but the guests GOBBLED them up!

Everyone loved these! Made them for a cocktail party and they didn't last very long at all. The only problem was that they took so long to prepare. I would definately bake them in a broiling pan to cut back on the grease.

Made these for the first time  for the super bowl party at our daughters house.They disappeared in no time and everyone loved them.  They really are good.  I did make one change on some of them, I added a chunk of pineapple, then wrapped with bacon, did everything else the same.  The ones with pineapple went first, and everyone agreed that those were just a little better, but liked them all.  Will definitely be making many more times, this is now a family favorite

So easy & simple to make!  They were gone before I knew it!  I added a little BBQ sauce on half of them about 5 min before they were done & they turned out great too!  These are a huge hit...next time I plan on making double!

Add a little red pepper or red pepper flakes with the brown sugar...gives it just a little "kick". Great recipe, use it often

These were a huge hit at a party recently. How could they not be??  I'm glad I read the reviews before hand. I made them several hours ahead of time. I turned up the oven to 350 since the bacon wasn't crispy as fast. I flipped them halfway through. If you don't they start to burn on the bottom cause of the sugar and fat. After they were done, I removed them with a slotted spoon and added to my slow cooker on low. I added more brown sugar on top and gave them a couple of stirs. I only cooked them for about 3 hours before the party. They probably could have gone 4 hours on low. Next time I'm thinking about adding a 1/4 cup of coca cola to the slow cooker too. Maybe for the Superbowl!

I wouldn't call these anything special but they are quite good.  My family loves them.  My husband doesn't ordinarily eat sausage of any kind but he loves these!  Definitely line the pan with foil because they are messy!  I do not keep them in a crock pot because we don't like soggy bacon--but they don't last long enough to warrant holding in the crock pot anyway.   I have also done these in a frying pan and they turn out very well.  I cut the bacon in half and wrap them WITHOUT toothpicks.  Then sprinkle the brown sugar on and let them sit a few minutes until the sugar dissolves.  Just pan fry using tongs to turn; less time consuming and easier to get the bacon evenly browned.

Christmas tradition with these bad boys! They are so good!  I hate wieners and I LOVE these.  I have yet to  have anyone who doesn't like them.  I buy big packs of the little cocktail weenies and smoked bacon, I cut the bacon package in half and wrap each one in the half piece of bacon - no toothpicks needed this way!  I foil line the baking sheet, and wrap each one on the foil, once they are assembled in neat little lines I sprinkle each one with brown sugar.  For parties we add them to the crock pot and pour the grease and sugar mixture over top - keep stirring once in awhile so they don't burn.  The time consuming task of wrapping is worth it.  My husbands favorite treat he requests on fathers day breakfast :)

Excellent and so easy.  As suggested by others, I did line my baking sheet with foil.  Also increased the temp to 350 degrees for final 15 minutes.  Kept warm in a slow cooker adding maple syrup for moisture.  This was a big hit at a pot luck I went to today!

Yum! Definitely shake up the smokies with the bacon slices in the brown sugar first.  Then roll and still sprinkle on more sugar!  Baked on rack for 30 mins @ 400 -- good thing my pan was lined with foil, or it'd be headed for the trash right now!  ( :  Haven't tried keeping them in the crock yet, but will do that for Christmas munchies.  Loved it!

I have made these for years with one addition. In our family we like a little zip so we have always added about 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon of chili powder.  We dont really measure the chili powder just about that much. It gives it a little spice with the sweet. Everywhere we have had these, always ask for the ingredients. YUM

Update to my original review: I've made these 2 more times & AWESOME is still how I'd describe them. I followed some other reviewers' suggestions & dredged the bacon in brown sugar in addition to sprinkling the tops. If you have the time give this a whirl!! Don't get me wrong the recipe is great as written but dredging the bacon gave it a more uniform coating. Also I recommend using a heavy duty aluminum foil on your cookie sheets. It really helped in the clean up effort. I baked mine at the recommended temp but increased the cook time by 5 minutes just because I wanted my bacon a little darker. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!! I know I'll use it for years to come!!

I will take the advice from others next time and coat the bacon in the brown sugar prior to wrapping the smokies.  It takes a while for the bacon to cook and worth every minute.  Excellent!

I needed a quick and easy potluck recipe, and came across these...YUM!! They were the first thing gone, and everyone asked for the recipe! I assembled them the night before, and sprinkled brown sugar on in the morning. I used toothpicks to make it easier for serving. It is a little time consuming wrapping them, but they are so good! I made more tonight for my family, and there are only a few left. Even my super picky daughter ate them up! I didn't measure the brown sugar, but I used more than 3/4 cup, OH...I also used maple bacon for extra flavor...Thanks for a great keeper!!!

Great to put out at parties. They still taste good once they reach room temp…if they last that long. To make clean up a snap, I put aluminum foil on the cookie sheet and sprayed it with Pam before putting on the skewered smokies. And I like my bacon crispy so I ended up cooking them for closer to 55 minutes. My husband wasn’t crazy about the brown sugar taste, so next time I will probably make two batches; one with the brown sugar and one without.

Awesome!  They truly are "meat candy".  I didn't bother with the toothpicks and just stretched out thin strips of bacon around the smokies.  I cooked them a day in advance, then added a little syrup for extra liquid and kept them warm in a crock pot during the party.

Family loved these! Took others advice and rolled in the brown sugar before baking. Been making these since first review in 2008.  Another tip is to turn them over half way through; nicer all around browning and crisping.

3 little girls polished off almost the entire batch of these Super Bowl Sunday. We three adults each got a couple, however. I poured the brown sugar in a bowl and stirred the smokies around in it before rolling in the bacon. I didn't use much more brown sugar when I baked them. They are fabulous!

I made this as an appetizer for the Super Bowl. They were easy to make. I covered each piece of bacon and each smokie in the brown sugar before I put them together. Next time I'll just sprinkle the sugar over the top because I don't think it made much of a difference and it was more time consuming.

I make this recipe in the slow cooker, cooking on low for about 2 hours,perfect to keep warm for work/potlucks! I agree with the review suggesting maple bacon, this change alone could add a 6th star. My 4 kids request this at EVERY game/party/potluck.

Have prepared these for numerous events and have yet to find anyone who does not like them.  They are always the first to go.  In fact, I typically do not like bacon or sausage but am quite fond of these little bites. I have found that rolling each one around in the brown sugar, then sprinkling more brown sugar over them before baking really does the trick!  I have never secured with a toothpick--no problems.  Also, have never put in a crockpot; they're delicious at room temp!

Quickly eaten by all my guests.  We like the name "pig candy" suggested by another reviewer.  Very appropriate.  I would put the brown sugar between the bacon and the frank.  Also, put these on a cooling rack over a foil wrapped pan.  Saves trying to turn them when they are so hot.

I've made these twice - the first time, after reading the reviews, I really loaded up the brown sugar, and didn't much care for them - way too sweet.  Second time I just dredged my bacon in brown sugar, then lightly sprinkled with brown sugar before putting in the oven.  They were perfect - had just enough brown sugar to "crunch up" the bacon - they were gone in just a few minutes!

This recipe makes a lot, but we had NO leftovers! They were easy to make and delicious! I was afraid that they would have an awfully strong "meaty" taste, but the brown sugar worked so well with that! Thanks for sharing.

I personally didn't love these, but I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because my guests sure loved them! This was the only thing that was totally eaten at our party tonight. 

Although it takes a little time to wrap and bake, they were easy to make and everyone thought they were delicious. Per the suggestions in the other comments, I turned up the heat for the last 15 minutes (then broiled for a couple of minutes) to get my bacon crispier. I hate chewy bacon!

These little guys are great! People really seemed to enjoy them for the most part! Very simple recipe, too. I added about 1/4 cup extra brown sugar and put it on just before popping them in the oven. I also wrapped a few sausages with extra bacon (just to see...) and they were extra good! If you choose to do the extra bacon bit, I'd follow the advice of a fellow reviewer and consider crisping the bacon up under the broiler for a minute or so (like she said, beware of flaming toothpicks!!!!! :D).

These really are like meat candy.  So easy to prepare, just make sure to watch them so they don't burn.  I always have to make a double batch because they get eaten fast!

I had these before and they were excellent.  However, the recipe does not call for enough baking time and the bacon was to chewy.  My family likes it crispier.  Next time I will use broiler for a few minutes as other readers suggested and I know we will then give these a 5 star!

This was pretty yummy! I assembled them the night before and wrapped the cookie sheets in saran wrap. I baked them as normal in the morning. It did make a big mess on my pans but I washed them asap so it was pretty easy to clean. I did not use toothpicks and they stayed together on their own (I placed the seam side down on the cookie sheet). I also put them in the crockpot at work with some maple syrup and the pan drippings. These were gone in no time and my coworkers loved them. I would make this again :)

So I did what other's suggested with the skewers and then sprinkled brown sugar on them and put them in the fridge for about 1 hour before cooking them 
cooked my at  400 for 40min then when they where done I pulled them off the skewers and put in my crockpot so I could take to the party when I got there put my crockpot on low 
But WOW everyone loved these didnt even last 1 hour at the BBQ I think I might have got to eat 2 of these yummy things before they were gone
Thank you for a great recipe 
I had to write the recipe down for 5 differnt people
Very Messy to make but so worth it

I baked these on a baking rack so that the bacon grease would drain onto the cookie sheet.  My kids loved them.  I will definitely make again.

I know its been said, but this recipe was awesome!  Made it for my husbands birthday party and it was the first thing gone!  I used little red smokies and maple bacon (just the lean, cut off the fat).  Don't be stingy with the brown sugar!  Definitely a good idea to use the disposable broiler pans for easy clean-up.

I call this "Meat-Candy". It is so delicious! The only change I made to the original recipe is that I used half of the brown sugar that was called for. It just seemed like too much sugar. My way tasted great! The only thing that makes these taste better is dipping them in brown & spicy mustard. Yum! I disagree with some other reviewers ... don't be discouraged from trying this recipe; it's not that time consuming to prep.

I love these and so does everyone else that tries them.. But i when i make them i make a whole bunch and then i take grape jelly, maple syrup and brown sugar melted on the stove top to a boil and then pour that over the top of the smokies. Put in a preheated oven for about a hour at 350. I put them in a glass bowl or whatever works for you.

I made these for a football playoff party (GO GIANTS) and they were gone by the third quarter. My 3 year old ate about 5 himself. Yes, they were messy and to prepare, but it was well worth it. I sprinkled some of the brown sugar on the bacon before wrapping them and I also sprinkled them again before I put them in the over. I used both turkey and center cut regular bacon. I did have to secure the turkey bacon ones with a toothpick because the bacon kept easily unraveling or tearing. I do recommend lining your pan with foil as it is a mess to clean up (some drippings got out somehow and made a MESS in the over).

These are the best appetizers ever! The first time I made them, I don't think I added enough sugar, you could tell they would've been better with a little more. The second time I added to much sugar and not all the sugar melted and it turned into a kinda crunchy coating (which some people at the bbq really liked about them) But after making these highly requested appetizers several times I've found the right amount and they are fantastic. Almost everyone I've ever made them for has asked for the recipe which makes them an impressive success at any get together. They're ALWAYS the first thing to disappear, so  I'm always sure to bring plenty as people seem disappointed when they're gone.

After all the great reviews I was disappointed. They were soso and not worth all the effort. Not bad tasting but certainly not the awesome treat all the reviews claimed.  Sugared bacon would have tasted the same.

I have made this recipe for several years now.  I do a couple time saving tips.  I go to the local dollar store and buy disposable pans and I buy the crock pot liners, so basically I have no clean up.  I have made 200 of these weiners for parties and in no time they are gone.  
I usually make the night before and bake right before serving.  I wrapped the bacon with center cut bacon and use a toothpick much easier for guest to grab.  I put the brown sugar on top.  Before putting weiners in crock pot I put maple syrup in the bottom to keep them moist.  
Will have to try the dip recipe mentioned.

This is a tremendous "meat candy" recipe! I like preheating the oven to 400, then turn down to 350 when I place them inside. This helps crispen a little better. I also agree with toothpicks and foil or parchment. The center-cut bacon works very well for less fat and a crisper product.

These were so good and very easy to make.  I practically had to pull my son away from the baking sheet when then came out of the oven!  I will make these tasty little treats whenever I need a great finger food.  I was very pleased with these.

I made these Halloween night and the kids loved them!   Next time I'll use smaller pieces of bacon.  Some of the bacon fat did not cook and the smaller smokies got overcooked.

What's the big deal?  It was hard to make sure the bacon was done.  Everyone complained they were too sweet.  Regular old pigs-in-a-blanket beat these any day.  We were disappointed in this recipe.

This is an awesome recipe. I had this for the first time for a pot luck and everyone was clammering for the recipe.

I agree with most of the reviews, line the bottom of the broiler pan with foil first or you will have a big mess to clean up...this also cuts down on the greasiness.

I coat them a little differently though, I wrap the smokies first, then I put them in a zip lock baggie with brown sugar and lightly shake them to coat.

These are always the first thing to go at any party...YUMMY!

I made this for my son's first communion party and it was the first appetizer to disappear!  We made it before we left, then transferred them to the crock pot and went to the church.  when we came home they were hot and ready and delicious!!!  We did broil them for just a bit to get them crispy, but everything else was just as the recipe stated.  Will make this again and again!!!

These were excellent.  I made them for a baby shower at work and everyone loved them.  I love the brown sugar.  I will make these again, I love the fact that there are only 3 ingredients.  I used regular beef hot dogs and cut them up in 3rds.

I made these as one of the appettizers served at my wedding and oh what a big hit.  That was 5 years ago and ever since people  that ask us over for a function always request that I bring those "cocktail weenie thingys you made for your reception".  I was once told by my cousin that I better not walk in her door without them.  So yummy and easy to make !

I cooked these for the time stated but they burned, i should have checked them but i got distracted with company. They tasted pretty good but they looked nasty. MEAT CANDY is a very appropriate name. I recommend using a disposable pan. Incredibly messy!One sheet of foil was not enough!I know these will be great the next time i make them!!! UPDATE 4/2008-I have mastered this recipe and it really deserves 5 stars, i got my cousin's husband addicted to it and caused some drama by eating the last one. I have made it on a camping trip and for a football game. Guys love this stuff!

I made these for the first time for our Super Bowl party. They were the first thing to go! I will be making these for every party we have from now on. I cut the brown sugar by half because I was afraid it would be too sweet. Next time I will make it as written because I didn't really notice it much. Thanks for sharing!

I just rolled the smokies in the brown sugar after wrapping them in bacon. Easier that way, then I sprinkled more sugar on the top.  Put them in a crockpot to stay warm.  Boyfriend and kids wouldn't stay out of the crockpot! Great recipe for the Superbowl!  I started broiling them and they started to burn so I alternated baking and broiling!

My family calls these "Heart Stoppers", because they are NOT for those with high cholesterol.  I use maple flavored bacon for extra sweetness, and allow them to sit in the sauce for extra dipping.

These are by far the best appetizer ever!! Everyone finds them irresistable and they are most requested by my friends for parties. I undercook them a little because I set them out in either a crock pot or covered electric skillet and they crisp up more. Definetly worth the time they take to prepare and I always do a double batch!

Made them twice for two different parties and they were gone by the end of the party both times!  I saw men just standing around popping them in their mouths all night!!  
A little time consuming, but super simple!!  I didn't measure any brown sugar, I just sprinkled it on each little sausage on the pan.  Use foil too!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I had few problems with my finished product.  There was too much juice in the pan at the end and the bacon wouln't crisp because of it.  Also, the juice sort of washed away the brown sugar flavor. I have had theses before so I know they are very delicious.  I think I may have put too many in the pan at once and using a broiler pan where the juice could drain might work better next time.

Pretty good... kids loved the flavor combination, salty/sweet. However, I had to practically burn these to get the bacon done enough.

I'llmake a version of these again, but definitely not THIS recipe.

This is a good recipe, although the brown sugar doesn't get all the way into the smokies...I didn't read the reviews about shaking the bacon and smokies in brown sugar until after I cooked them, but I will definitely do that next time for a fuller taste!

I made these last year for my husband and I at Christmas and we loved them. I actually included them at our wedding reception a few months ago.  Now our families demand we bring them for Xmas this year. The mess is minimal if you prepare in a disposable or lined pan. o haven't had an issue with enough coating by the brown sugar.  Sprinkling the sugar on top has worked very well for me.

These are great... and simple.  2nd time this week I've made them for parties.  The first time I was pressed for time baking them and kicked it up to broil as someone had suggested, while watching them and I wanted the bacon done so kind of turned them a little to make sure both sides were baked well.  Before transferring them to my crockpot, I blotted them on a paper towel to eliminate some of the grease.  They went so fast, they didn't even need the crock pot.  2nd time around in making them, I added the Outback Dill Dip that another reviewer had shared.  Awesome all around.

Great recipe! I made this for a group tonight and it got excellent reviews!  Like others I would definitely recommend lining the pan with foil.  I sprinkled a little brown sugar on the top of them after placing on the platter just to make sure they had the right amount of sweetness - I did not use the full 3/4 cup to start with and they turned out great.

I have made this recipe for many occasions and I get compliments no matter where I take it. The first time I made it, I did not make enough and so now I always have to double the recipe. I have a special trick that adds ALOT to the recipe and I pour some maple syrup over the the smokies after I put them in the crock pot.

These were a big hit with the guys at the party!  I didn't bother with the toothpicks, just rolled the bacon around the little smokies, and put them close to each other in a 9x13 pan and they were fine.  Many requests for me to make again for future parties!

These were good. They got rave reviews and everyone seemed to think they were awesome. I made them for a party and my boyfriend declared that no one else could have any because he wanted them all. I thought they were too greasy, but what else can one expect from bacon? Thanks for the recipe!

I really wanted to like this one but it was too sweet for my taste.  Pork fat rules but they were too greasy.

I originally made these for a 
Christmas party.  I doubled the recipe since there were supposed to be quite a few people there.  Unfortunately, hardly anyone showed up for the party, so the party was a bust, but the five of us that were there gobbled these up.  I didn't think it took all that long to wrap the smokies and I used a disposable pan (and no crockpot) to help with cleanup.  I have made them several times and they are always delicious!

These are so worth the time and effort.  I used extra brown sugar - enough to cover all the smokies in a roasting pan.  TOO DIE FOR!

I made these for the family get-together on Christmas Eve.  Everyone loved them!  I used hickory bacon to give it a little more flavor.  My niece polished off the few leftovers after we opened presents.

very good - remember to use foil as they make a mess!  I don't even bother with the crock pot - I put them out on the hot pan and they dissappear.

I made this for New Year's Eve party.  Everybody loved it.  I made a double batch.  I read the reviews before, so I also rolled mini smokies in brown sugar before I wrapp those with bacon.  I still think bacon should be cut in half and not in thirds.  Thirds were too short and did not wrap smokies very well.  I put them in a crock pot but like others said, they would dry out if you keep it on low for too long so I turned it off after about two hours.  Thanks for the wonderful recipes.

My husband took these today into work and everyone loved them. A very easy appetizer to prepare. I used thick sliced bacon. It took more than a pound, but looked nice wrapped around the smokies. I also sprayed my baking pan with no-stick cooking spray prior to baking and I had absolutely no messy clean up to fool with. I am going to make these again for Christmas. Thankyou for the recipe!

Made this recipe for a party - actually whipped them up about an hour before people showed up.  They went together fairly quickly.  They also disappeared fairly quickly as well.  This is a recipe that will be added to my "will make again" file.  Thanks for a fun recipe.

My family has been making these for years; with a little variation.  I use Juicy Jumbo weiners (cut in half) and also cut the bacon in half to wrap it.  I wrap them with the bacon and then put them in the crock pot on low for about 5 hours. (I have prepared them at night and left them on low overnight if I plan to serve them early in the day)  You also have to add more brown sugar but they are really good.

These are fabulous! Always the first to go at any party. What's not to love about pork wrapped around pork! I usually have to cook these at about 375 degrees to get them to cook in 40 minutes.

Loved these, & so did my guests. I used 1/2 piece of bacon per smokie, and when they were done, I put them in a crockpot, sprinkled more brown sugar on top, and set it on low for an hour, then warm.

Made this many times in the past and loved it as directed. I just made it again since Costco had a sale on both items Farmer John's bacon and the Hillshire lil smokies. I just baked it in the nuwave without toothpicks same results but faster. Baked 5-6 min on one side and carefully turned each one tip/top end turn. Sprinkled more sugar. Kept grease or drain it's up to you. Baked a little longer about 6-7 minutes or more depends how you like your bacon. Delicious and Quick. I buy in bulk most of the time and i find out that 1 bacon package wraps approx 30 to 36 sausages depends on bacon.

Made these the night before a bridal shower I was having for my niece then popped them in the oven on the day.  Got rave reviews by so many people and was asked for the receive by many.  I did what many reviewers recommended, I put the brown sugar, smokies and bacon in a zip lock bag,  shook it, wrapped the smokies, put them on a baking tray with foil, wrapped it with Saran and put it in the fridge over night.  Just popped the tray into the oven the next day.

These are simple yet a crowd pleaser. I made them for SuperBowl and they were a great hit, much better than the Falcons. Like others I ended up cooking at a higher temp.

I made them, according to the directions. But they were undercooked and the bacon wasn't crispy at all. So I upped the temperature on the oven to 425/450, put them in a little longer, and they came out great! Next time, I will try them at a higher temperature (425), and put them in for a shorter amount of time (10 or 15 minutes, 20 at the most.)

I made the mistake of taking these to a family gathering a few years back, and now I have to make them every holiday!  Time consuming, but worth it.  I've made them as early as 2 days in advance,  letting them "marinate" in the brown sugar.

GREAT appetizer and very easy. I baked them for 40 minutes then put them under the broiler until the bacon was browned. My husband is not a fan of the baked bacon so the broiler was a must to make the bacon crispy. To avoid being too greasy, I removed them from broiler pan and served them in a pyrex dish on a heated tray. RAVE reviews!

Added a little chili powder and cayenne to the brown sugar, and since I only wanted a few as a snack, I baked them in the toaster oven. Otherwise no changes.
DELICIOUS. My boyfriend was sceptical at first but came around in no time flat.

A friend made these for a Christmas party and they were a huge hit. Now I make them throughout the year for family and friend get-togethers. I do add some dry mustard to the brown sugar just to give it a little kick. They are amazing!

I love this little app as it's very cheap and a real crowd pleaser. The bacon gets nice and crisp on the edges and the brown sugar caramelizes deliciously.

If you have never had a food buzz you need to try these. I think this is one of the best things I have EVER eaten.  I made them with the Cheddar little smokies, Before adding the bacon I tossed the smokies in a bag with the brown sugar, then wrapped with the bacon. I added a bit more brown sugar on top before baking. After 40 minutes turn them over if you like crisp bacon and cook another 10 minutes or so. I kept them in a crockpot on low to serve.

My other recipe mixes butter and brown sugar and then pours it over the bacon wrapped wieners, but they were always dripping in grease.  I found this and like it soooo much better.  I've made it numerous times and everybody loves them.

I've made these a few times now, and everyone loved them! There is a difference between baking them in a glass dish and a metal one.  The glass works better as the sugar doesn't caramelize.  I also broil them a couple of minutes after baking them.

Made these for the Super Bowl about an hour before people were to arrive and kept them warm in the crockpot. They were amazing and not difficult to make. Next time, I will put pure maple syrup with them in the crockpot after they are baked as other reviewers suggested to keep them from drying out and becoming crispy.

These were a huge hit at the Superbowl party.   After baking them I moved them to a slow cooker on low with some maple syrup to keep them moist.  

I originally made a spicy ketchup to go with it, but everyone skipped that and just ate them plain.

Made these for the Holidays & Super Bowl, they don't last long. Knowing a local butcher who has a large variety of bacons we have had these in different flavors, paprika being the best. Quick and easy make ahead. We soak the toothpicks to prevent burning.

Excellent recipe.  It's not for eating every day but for a special Super Bowl day, they were perfect.  Easy, 3 ingredients!  I did use the beef sausages and liked that better than the porky ones.  I did put the brown sugar in a baggie and just put the bacon wrapped sausages in there, shook and squished it around and then layed out on the sheet pan.  I baked for 35 minutes, they were done enough.  They are sitting in a crockpot on low right now.  Thanks for this simple yet delicious recipe.

I really must be behind the times because I just started making these, but at least I had the benefit of reading all the reviews for mistakes and triumphs.  My first try at these were good, my husband loved them as he loves anything he shouldn't be eating, cholesterol levels, you know.
My second try was even better.   I was trying to figure a a way to make the brown sugar stick better and cut down the amount of bacon used (party pooper...that's me).  I partially froze my bacon so it would cut easier. Then I cut it in thirds and then stacked the bacon in 3 stacks and cut it lengthwise thus stretching the amount of bacon to twice the number of smokies.  It worked, there was really no difference in flavor at all.  Plus, after wrapping the smokies I rolled them through a bit of maple syrup THEN rolled them through the brown sugar, the sugar really stuck.  I foiled lined a sheet and sprayed the heck out of it, nothing stuck to the foil . I also put about 7 or 8 on a skewer and was able to turn them more quickly without having to turn the temperature up, no need to broil with the lesser amount of bacon it was nice and crispy. No need for a Crock Pot either, these babies were gone in a flash.

I've made this twice now! I figured out they taste even better with pork smokies. Hubby prefers them with out the brown sugar and I think he's nuts! Great recipe!

The recipe I use calls for sprinkling a little vinegar along with the brown sugar and chilling several hours or overnite before baking.

I  experienced these delectable culinary delights with Thanksgiving dinner this year.  My stepson dubbed them "Crack Smokies"  because they are so addictive.  Try one and you'll want them all!  :-)

This recipe is excellent as is or, for a twist, sprinkle with crushed red pepper to taste.  I make a pan of each when I make these.  I love them both ways.

I've made these for years.  No matter how many I make, they ALL get eaten.  Everyone loves them.  I have even made a large batch and frozen them in small packages.  They're wonderful if someone drops by.  Serve with some cheese and  a bottle of wine.

Great flavor!  2# bacon cut into thirds for 3 pkg. little smokies .  No need for toothpicks.

Next time foil pan, spray cooling rack with Pam, lay on smokies, sprinkle with brown sugar.  After baking in middle or oven, broil to crisp up bacon, flip and crisp again.  Keeps well in a crock pot with a little maple syrup drizzled over top (then  you don't have to buy expensive maple flavored bacon).

I was invited over to a friends' house. My friend introduce me to his wife and she was deep frying a snack that they enjoy eating from time to time. The dish is similar to this recipe, but my friend told me that they call it bacon sandwich. By which they use a bread stuffing wrapped with bacon and deep drying it to a golden brown.

Every time I make these, they are a crowd pleaser!  I've just popped a batch out of the oven as a pre-Super Bowl snack for my husband to enjoy.  He asks every year when I'm working on his menu for the big game if I will be making his 'man candy' again.  I make the recipe as written, with no changes.

These are always a hit.  I suggest you do the bacon wrap ahead of time because it can get time consuming (and a bit messy).  It is good if you measure one piece of bacon and then cut all of your bacon ahead of time.  Keep the bacon cold (definitely).  I wrap them early in the day and keep them on a tray in the refrigerator.  Then you just pop them into the over.  They are worth the effort - always a favorite!  I love all of the suggestions made in the reviews.  I will try a few of them also.  :)

Delicious! My BF was skeptical, but he changed his mind after he tried them. I baked mine on the non-stick tin foil, but the best part is to let them cool a little and let the drippings (bacon fat and brown sugar) start to thicken into a kind of syrup on the bottom of the smokies...yum! Next time I'll try using maple flavored bacon (as was suggested by another user). Thanks JILL1018! :)

Made these to take along to a Christmas Luncheon, the women did not even get a look in, the men made straight for them. I stuck to the recipe as given, only difference was I used what in New Zealand we call Cocktail Sausages which are Pork based as we can't buy 'wieners'.

Disappeared at all three different gatherings I went to this past week! These are not difficult at all to make and do not take much time either. You will not be disappointed and your appetizer will be the hit at the party for sure! I did take the recommendation of putting these little mouth bombs in the crock pot after pulling them out of the oven and moistening them with maple syrup - added flavor and kept them from drying out.

One word "YUM-BO" !!  Note: If you choose to keep these little puppies warm in the crockpot after cooking...set your crockpot on "Warm" not on "Low" (a mistake I made in the Christmas craziness...even still they were all eaten up)

There are many variations you can do to this recipe that would make it even better!  For example, wrap the smokey in a thin slice of Vidalia onion before the bacon.  Or if you like a bit of heat, wrap the smokey in a Jalapeno pepper with a thin spreading of cream cheese before the bacon and omit the brown sugar.  WOW!

When I saw this recipe, I thought it was too simple to be a 5 star dish.  I made these for a Christmas get-together and got so many compliments on them.  They were gone in no time and everyone loved them.  A little time-consuming, but easy and a big hit.

I've been making these for years, and jokingly call them heart attacks on sticks!  They are crowd pleasers at pot lucks peopled by less health conscious party goers.  I throw them in a crockpot set on warm for the party.

THESE WORK IN THE SLOW COOKER TOO!!! These are awesome!  Once you get them wrapped, put them in the slow cooker, sprinkle with the brown sugar & cook for approx. 4 hours.

I just made this for a pitch in at work.  I placed the brown sugar in a container and then placed each slice of bacon in the brown sugar to coat it evenly.  I then laid a bunch of slices on the chopping board and place the wieners on each slice.  I then rolled them up and stuck a tooth pick in to hold them together.  After cooking them they had a little burnt mark on the side where they laid on the cookie sheet (foil).  This did not affect the taste.  I loved them, they were a little sweet and a little greasy but I am sure they will be a hit.

I hate little smokies, always have, but I love these.  I guess bacon just makes everything better.  I used Hillshire Farm Beef Lil' Smokies and a lean center cut bacon.  Use the leanest bacon you can because your pan will be full of grease.  I also lined my pan with foil for easier clean up and fliped these halfway through so they were evenly browned.  I dumped them in the crockpot on a low setting and everyone helped themselves.  These are so bad for you, but taste SO good!

These are good but really messy.My baking sheets were swimming in grease.The unfortunate part was...as I was removing from the oven I dropped the pan on the floor and lost most of my smokies ( and made a huge mess ) so I didn't have enough to take to the party.I've had these several times in the past and they are always a big hit at parties.

These are a  must at your next party.  I served them for the super bowl and they were a huge hit.  I made sure to use a thick cut, good quality bacon and I just eyeballed my brown sugar.  These get better as they sit in the crock pot.  The sugar mixes with the bacon grease and makes a wonderful sauce.

These are FABULOUS.. I make them everyyear for my Halloween Party! I actualy wrap them in the bacon the day before on tinfoil lined cooked sheets. The Day of the party, I sprinkle with brown sugar and bake, then put them in the crockpot like the recipe says, and you have a GREAT appetizer without the work!!

I made this again this year for Superbowl, and it's definitely a crowd pleaser.  This recipe is very easy and holds up well in the crock pot.  This is one of the best party recipes there is!

These were amazing, served at my Christmas Open House & everyone raved about them, the combination is very tasty. I used small smoked cocktail sausages from Safeway if you have one in your area. I baked them on parchment paper for easy clean-up!Thanks for the great recipe!

Rave reviews on this recipe!  After reading comments, the only change was to coat the bacon with the sugar first before wrapping.  Brought it to a New Year's party and they were gone in minutes - afterwards, friends begged me to make them again for our Super Bowl party.  So easy - just a bit time consuming.

I agree with other reviewers... cook at higher temp until nice and crispy.  I had to kiss my favorite pan good-bye after not lining with enough layers of aluminum foil but it was worth it.  These were a huge hit at our Christmas Eve party.

I only made a few of these--only had 3 slices of bacon left over from another dish, so I made nine of these.  I used turkey bacon since that's what I had, and it still worked perfectly.  I wasn't sure about the brown sugar since I've had sugared bacon before and really didn't like it, but I sprinkled it on anyway.  These are pretty good.  I'm sure they'd be a pain if I were making more than 9, but since I just made a few they were easy, quick, and good.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were awesome!!!  I didn't use toothpicks to hold them closed.  Thought the bacon would stay tucked underneath...not the case.  Didn't hurt anything though.  They disppeared in a hurry!!!

People beg me to make these. They are little heavenly meat candies. I put some brown sugar in a bowl and after I wrap and secure the bacon with a tooth pick I roll it in the bowl of brown sugar. Line your sheets with foil. I serve them in a crock pot and I also put a little maple syrup in the crock pot with them. So good

I did not find this recipe time consuming at all!  What I did find was a scrumptious treat for my taste buds!  These little babies were fast to prepare, tasted delicious and everyone loved them.  I did not even need tooth picks to hold the bacon on, I just placed the end side down on the baking sheet.  Thanks for this recipe.

Little bundles of joy. Even better if you line your baking sheet with alum foil before you bake. Makes clean up a snap. Will make again. Thanks for a nice appetizer.

This is the first appetizer I've served over my long cooking career that had friends calling me on holidays to tell them the recipe over the phone.  Simply wonderful!  I used some beef and some turkey smokies - it sure didn't make a difference to anyone.

I made this for a Christmas Eve party.  The rave reviews led me to expect something spectacular, but this recipe fell short of that.  They were good, but not great.  I definitely recommend marinating the smokies in brown sugar overnight.  I baked these in the oven and kept them warm in the crockpot.  This recipe didn't receive any comments or compliments, and I brought a little less than half of them back home.  I'll make them again because my kids really enjoyed them.

This was a hit at the party. I had no leftovers and in fact I think I'm going to double the recipe next time to make sure there is more! I did change a few things, I cut the bacon in half and wrapped the smokies and also made a tiger dill weed sauce with it from another reviewer, that seriously made them delicious! Also also after I put them in the crock-pot to keep warm put the drippings from in the pan and a dab of maple syrup. I will definitely be making these again. Easy and cheap! Good combo :o)

These are DELICIOUS as written, but I've been working to tweak/perfect this recipe here and there over the years and after several "lessons learned" this is what I do now... Put them all in rows in either a 9x13 pyrex, or a 3" deep broiling pan. When skewering, DO NOT push toothpick so that smokie is centered on the toothpick- if you JUST push it through (start on the seal end) so it's still quite secure, but there's more of a "handle" they're SO much easier to eat later.  Once the br.sug.'s on, I pour GENEROUS stripes over each row, of molasses, honey, maple syrup and the piece de resistance...  Spicy Brown Mustard.  Put in a cold oven set at 375 for one hour.  During this hour, baste them with the bubbly sugary bacon fat syrup every 10 mins. Good in a Crock Pot on low for 3-4 hours, but obviously best fresh... Let cool 7-10 mins or you WILL burn your face off... The waiting is the hardest part, harder than the skewering =) We LOVE them dipped in my homemade BBQ sauce =) I buy the big pkg of smokies and bacon at Costco in Nov and it's exactly the right amount to get us through Thanksgiving, Christmas and then Super Bowl Sunday.  Indulgence at it's finest!

If you let the smokies sit and marinate in the brown sugar before baking, it melts and tastes great. If you add them to a crockpot and keep them warm with some maple syrup like other reviewers have said you have the best smokies.

These are great! And very easy to make.  I made these for a Halloween party and called them Goblin Appendages.  They worked great with the Halloween theme since they are not the most pleasant looking appetizers.   Served with a a blue cheese dip from this site.

This is a great recipe! I made it for the first time last night for a get together. It barely made it to the neighbors house! It was all gone in about an hour and that was with a HUGE batch! I followed a suggestion of putting maple syrup in crockpot but i added some chopped onions to it to make sure it was too sweet. Came out wonderful! Thank you for recipe. Easy to make and tastes great!

These were pretty good.  I think it is definately a man appetizer.  I made around 200, stored them in a crock pot as some others had recommended and none came back home with me.  I cooked them quite a it longer than the 45 minutes to make sure the bacon was crispy.

This is a huge hit!  Everyone's loves them and they are so EASY to make, anyone can do it.  It is just a little time consuming, but worth it.  I do top the Smokies with extra brown sugar before I put them in the oven to get a little extra glaze on top!

I followed previous advice and rolled the bacon and the smokies in brown sugar, then sprinkled with brown sugar on top as well...they were fantastic and went far too quickly, I had numerous requests for the recipe! Thanks for the great addition to my appetizer collection :)

Easy. Inexpensive. Tasty. A sure-fire winner.  What can be better?   Like others wrote, I did a triple batch of these and they were gone within the first half of the birthday party.  My husband and I just rolled up about 90 smokies for a party today... let's see how long they last.

I made a triple receipe for a card party and kept them in an electric fry pan on low to keep warm.  Needless to say the electric pan wasn't needed.  It was hovered over until they were gone.  It always feels good to walk away from a party and your appetizer was the one that was gobbled up.

They were easy to make and tasted great. I followed the other suggestions and dipped the smokies and bacon in brown sugar before baking. I am going to try these in the slow cooker next time.

We made these one night when we didn't want to cook dinner, and we had everything on hand.  I was very skeptical of putting brown sugar on them, but they were very good!  I wanted something to dip them in, and used some green onion dip we had in the fridge.  Pretty good, though I may try a dip that I saw for these on this website next time.  Yummy...thanks!

Made these as some suggested cut the bacon into thirds and put in a ziplock bag with the brown sugar and shook. Then wrapped around the smokie. Made these last night for a superbowl party. They were gobbled up so fast. These are very good and addicting.

Love this recipe! I have made it a few times and have made some adjustments. I used a 1/2 c brown sugar and 2tb melted butter mix until smooth and then I mix in the smokies until they are coated. then I wrap the bacon around each smokie and rather than toothpicks I use a long wooden skewer(easy to flip while cooking), then sprinkle more brown sugar over. about 10-12 per skewer and they genlty fall of  the skewer after they cook  and stay wrapped because the brown sugar/butter acts like a glue. best football food ever!

I have used this recipe for about a year the only thing wrong is you never make enough !!!!!   I always double this recipe. ~ I have found if you cook the bacon in the microwave a couple minutes before wrapping it around the sausages it cuts down on the cooking time in the oven ~ and the sausages are not dried out. This recipe is the BOMB  Thanks PS you can also keep them warm in a crock pot for hours and they are still delic.

I like this, but the husband likes it with brown sugar AND soy sauce.
I mix 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup soy sauce together. 
After I cook the bacon wrapped smokies I put them in the slow cooker with the sauce.

Always a hit!  The crock pot made them kind of black though so next time I'm going to take the other readers suggestion of baking them on a baking rack to keep them from burning.

I love these!  My husband thinks they are a little to sweet though.  Everytime I make them they are gone fast.  They are time consuming, but once you start it goes pretty fast. I make them and then put them in the crockpot on warm and serve like that.

These are a HUGE hit everytime I make them.  I love them because I can assemble them in advance and put them in the over right before my guests arrive.  I throw them in the crock pot on low to keep them warm.

These were the first things gone at my party--they hold up well and are still good at room temp. My crock pot had cider in it but the baking dish kept these plenty warm. I marinated the smokies in the brown sugar (with a little squirt of mustard--great with sausages!) and then wrapped them, topping with another 1/3 cup brown sugar. The sauce was so good people were dipping apples into it after the smokies were gone! I didn't even get to try them they were gone so fast (except for a couple "test bites" eaten in the kitchen!)!

These were delicious. Perfect for a football party or any guy gathering.  I cooked them and then followed the advice from some of the other reviews.  I baked them, put them in the slowcooker and then poured the remaining jucies over!!

I made this for a dinner party.  They absolutely loved this.  My friends also call it meat candy.  I coat the bacon in the brown sugar before wrapping and sprinkle some on after.  I use the chedder lil smokies and serve them with a sweet and spicy mustard.

Definitely line the cookie sheet with foil!
I toss vigorously the bacon with the sugar in a sealed bowl. Make sure each side of the bacon strip is fully coated, then wrap the wieners.  I sprinkle the leftover sugar over the top.
You can also cook in advance (more like 50 minutes versus 40), refrigerate (on the pan, covered), then warm at 325 degrees for 15 minutes before serving in a slow cooker.

i get requests all the time to bring this to parties and it is always the first dish to disappear! i double the brown sugar and line the cookie sheet with tin foil for instant clean up. it does need to cook a bit longer than suggested to crisp up and caramelize the bacon and sugar. who knew pork covered in brown sugar could be this good?!

Excellent, perfect party food.  As has been stated many times in these reviews, this is the first dish to go no matter what other food is around!  I put a layer of brown sugar on the pan before I place the bacon wrapped smokie on the pan.  I then add another layer of brown sugar on the smokies - just to give it an extra hint of sweet.

These are a hit every time! I needed to bake mine quite a bit longer than the recipe called for to get the brown sugar the right consistency. Other than that, it was great.

A fantastic appetizer for any occasion. I use a 1/3 piece of cold bacon and roll the bacon in brown sugar that I have spread on a paper plate.  The sugar coats the whole piece nicely.  After baking, I always put them in the crock pot to keep warm.

Great!  These were easy (I didn't bother with toothpicks and they stayed together fine), cheap (3 ingredients; can't beat that), and, most importantly, DELICIOUS!

So good.  How can it not be.  Anything wrapped in bacon is tasty!  They were gone before they were completely cooled.  Followed recipe exactly.

Great recipe, super easy to prepare with just a few ingredients. We served it as an appetizer for a dinner party and these got more attention than anything else! Prepared the recipe as indicated, made no changes. Next time i'll try the maple syrup suggestion.

do NOT make this in a crockpot. there is too much bacon face and moistuer- it prevents the bacon from crisping up. did came out good when baked, though

I never thought I would make this.  Way too bad for anyone to actually eat.  But I did it for the kids.  And I must admit that I ate 2 of them.  Yum.  And a walk around the block with dogs.

I have been making these little guys forever.  My recipe calls for a 1 lb. package of hot dogs cut into 1/3's and wrap with 1/3rd of a strip of bacon.  No need for toothpicks, if you put them close enough together they will stay that way.  Also - use 1 cup of brown sugar mixed with one of those small containers of dry mustard (I don't know the exaxt size - sorry!)  Sprinkle over the hot dogs and let sit in frig for 6-8 hrs. or overnite.  After baking put them in crock pot.  I usually triple the recipe (90 bites of dog) EVERYONE loves these!!!

I made these, along with some other appetizers last night for my mother-in-law's birthday and these were the first things gone. They were wonderful. Everyone has already asked me to make more. And they were so simple and easy. I was afraid they would be too sweet so I served with a horseradish sauce but no one used it. Everyone ate them as they were and they were yummy! Thank you!

I cut the bacon into 3 equal parts and wrap each one around each smokie. Place on a rack in a 9x13 pan to catch the grease. Time consuming, but well worth it. Always a hit at cookouts and parties! Never leftovers.

WOW these went quick! I followed some user comments and cut the bacon into 4ths. I let them rest in the fridge for an hour or so and cooked them as directed, flipping them halfway through. I'll knock 5 minutes off the cook time next time I make these. Yummy! A keeper.

Absolutely wonderful! So easy to make and they get gobbled up. That reminds me to make some for Super Bowl this weekend. Also I have a home based biz where I do home shows. One of my customers made these and introduced me to them and they looked gorgeous on my platters. I have passed this recipe along to all of my hostesses since then. So delicious!

These are delicious - the first thing to disappear at the potluck.

Instead of sprinkling the sugar on top, I coated the bacon slices & wrapped the bacon sugar-side toward the smokies.

I will definately be making these again.

These were such a HUGE hit at my party last night!  They are super easy to make and only required THREE ingredients!  The brown sugar added a nice flavor and glaze to the smokies.  The only thing I would change is to make a double batch next time, because they got snapped up so quickly!

These are quite good.  I've made them in the oven and also outside on the grill.  I prefer them grilled... they cook much quicker and the bacon crisps up more.

These are OK, not insanely delicious and not awful.  I give them 5+ stars for ease of prep and cook but maybe 1 or 2 for taste, they taste (to me) very basic and no one at my gathering seemed to be wolfing them down (but then again I had a table full of food including many other appetizers). After wrapping the little guys up in bacon I pressed them into brown sugar I'd put into a Ziploc storage bag to avoid a mess...was super easy and covered the franks in sugar completely.  Would make again if anyone requests it, otherwise probably not. Everyone's tastes are different though!

My husband requests these all the time!  Last time he made them, and he put a pinch of red pepper flakes in the brown sugar.  Have to say they were pretty darn good with that extra zip!

OMG!  I made these for our family Christmas party, I am the one everyone counts on to bring a new idea.  WOW!  They went so fast that my mother-in-law who was last to go through the line didn't even get one.  I did place them in a slow cooker on low and used another reviewers suggestion of putting a little maple syrup to keep them moist.  My nephew rated it A+++.  Will definitely make these again and again!!!!

Excellent appetizers!  I sprinkled brown sugar on each bacon prior to wrapping them in Lil Smokies.  Then sprinkled more brown sugar once they are in the tray, prior to cooking.

After reading several previous reviews, I decided to follow the directions of using aluminum foil on the bottom of the broiler pan to catch all the bacon grease and carmelized sugar. I added several pieces of bacon alongside the wrapped smokies so their would be more grease drippings.  After they came out of the oven, I put them in the crock pot, added the grease/carmelized sauce and added more brown sugar.  These were fantastic!  Clean up was easy and my guests enjoyed!

Were not difficult to roll at all and turned out GREAT! I put the bacon and smokies into a bag and mixed with the brown sugar, was very easy and covered each one perfectly. They went so quick, I should have made double! Great recipe!

WOW!  I've made them for a few parties and the guests just to nuts for them, "gone in 60 seconds".  Make extras.  They only change I do is to make it with maple flavored bacon.  I cook them on a baking sheet rather that having them soak in the fat in a crock pot.  Fantastic and Easy, doesn't get much better than this one.

They were most definitely a hit for the Christmas party I took them to this weekend, possibly the first appetizer to be devoured! I don't think I put enough brown sugar on when I put them in the oven, so I added more in the crockpot which seems to really make a difference. Also, took another reviewer's advice and added maple syrup to the bottom of the crockpot... would HIGHLY suggest this step, cuz the smokies on the bottom were even more delicious! I also preferred using dark brown sugar, over other types. Great recipe, a few modifications, definitely greasy and a little messy to clean up. Everyone who reaches into the crockpot says "oh man- this is a heart attack on a stick"... but they keep reaching anyways!! :)

Really easy and good. Great party food. I sometimes make this by sprinkling a bit of crushed pineapple on it and all spice and bake them in a shallow dish. Yummy.

Winner!  This was the hit at our poker party, I cooked all day long for 20 people and this was the biggest hit of all dishes.  They were asking for more.  I cut bacon in half length wise then cut in 4 equal pieces, 1 lb bacon was enough for 2 pkgs smokies. This is a keeper!!!!

These were a HUGE HIT when I brought them to work.  Although it is a little time-consuming to wrap each individual smokie, it's well worth it and so yummy!!

I have been making this for years and it is one of my most requested recipes. I wrap the smokies in bacon and broil them until crisp, then I put it all in the slow cooker and cover with brown sugar and 1 cup water(helps the sugar melt).  My DH calls these "Heaven on a Toothpick"

Delicious.  Couldn't find the beef cocktail wieners so I used the little smokies sausages.  In every other way I followed the recipe exactly.  So good it was hard to stop eating them.

I always make a double batch for potlucks at work, and never bring home any leftovers.  It is well worth the prep time.

These lil' bad boys disappeared out of my crockpot at a recent gathering. I baked them to the recipe and there were still bits of unmelted brown sugar on top, but those crunchy bits were my favorite part! All my friends asked me to make them again!

I brought these to a BBQ yesterday in a crock pot to keep warm. These are EXCELLENT and SOOO easy. The only change I would make next time is to make twice as much because they were all gone before some of the guests got a chance to try them!

I thought these were great, especially for something quick. I was planning on bringing them to a work function on Monday so thought I'd practice on a few today. They are very easy to make and not super messy. I just used a pizza pan and did not even use foil. It was fine.

For some reason when I cooked mine for the time stated they completely burned on the bottoms. I used thin turkey bacon so I'm guessing thats why. I made another batch though and only cooked for 25 minutes and they turned out great! I rolled the smokies in brown sugar, then rolled the bacon in brown sugar and then put more brown sugar on top after they were wrapped. I put them in a crockpot with a maple syrup and brown sugar mixture as another poster suggested and they stayed moist and delious!

How can meat wrapped in meat go wrong?!!?  It can't in my book!  They were awesome, I made a double batch for my girls party - and had a few extras - which were loaded on to plates to go home with lots of "my husband will LOVE these".  I will make again for sure when I need a quick appetizer.  I didn't think that wrapping took that long, even for the double batch.

Fantastic! These were a huge success.  They went as fast as I could put them out.  I cut the bacon in half and had the kids wrap them.  I used baby smoked sausages.  The brown sugar is a perfect addition.

Very simple and delicious appetizer! Personally, I thought it sounded like entirely too much meat, but it's really not at all. The flavors blend together so well. I threw the smokies in a ziplock back with a bunch of brown sugar, then also sprinkled some on top as the recipe suggests. Placed in a slow cooker & forgot to add the maple syrup as another reviewer suggested, and still were very moist. They were the first thing gone at my daughter's first birthday. OH - and MAKE SURE you use a layer or two of aluminum foil on your pan - MUCH easier cleanup.

I didn't like these when they first came out of the oven because I tasted too much sugar on them.  However after putting them in the crockpot for the party that I took them too, they were really good and the tastes had blended well.  We will be making these again. YUM!!!

I have made these delicious little gems for pot luck parties and it never fails to be the most popular item in the room.  I get lots of requests for the recipe.  A big winner!

Question -- has anyone tried  substituting chicken breast chunks for the smokies?

Most definately a staple at every party I go to or host.
 A must is buying disposable cookie sheets. Makes Clean Up a snap. Eat acouple yourself before serving, might be your only chance at getting some.

These are great!  The combination of flavors mix well.  I did what was mentioned below and put it all in a plastic baggie before rolling up and tossed it around.  It coated everything nicely.  Also served with the dip mentioned below also and it made a great addition.

Very good.  Not time consuming at all. I doubled the batch and it worked out perfect smokies v.s. bacon.  I have a medium size crock pot and it was perfect amount so that the pot looked pretty full.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummmmm!!!  Definitely a guilty pleasure but well worth it.  I made a double batch of these to take to work and there were only a few leftover.  Everyone raved about them.  I don't think they are difficult or time consuming at all.  I used kitchen shears to cut 3 slices of bacon at one time (definitely put the bacon in the freezer in between cuts).  I just had a little assembly line going and before I knew it they were done!  Will definitely make these again and again for parties at our house.  And they smell sooo good in the crock pot (I have a "keep warm" setting on my crock pot which was perfect for these).

FABULOUS! Family loved them. As a matter of fact, I made 12 on the first try and had an immediate request for more. I do recommmed that they are wrapped in the bacon, then rolled in the sugar, placed onto the pan and last the toothpicks are placed in. It worked for me. :)

Great comments from the boys on poker nite. But you can't go wrong with bacon! Thanks for the great idea, what an easy appetizer. I was worried about the comments about this recipe being time consuming, so I rolled the bacon 1&1/2 days ahead, kept them in the fridge in a tight sealed container, and cooked it a few minutes before guests arrived! Also used 1/3 a piece of bacon, as a reader suggested. No trouble at all. Thanks!

Made this over Memorial Day weekend, and everyone loved it! Doubled the recipe and now see I should have at least tripled it, if not more. Definitely worth the time it takes to prepare.

I've had these before when someone else was the chef. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the brown sugar did not melt completely. There were still chunks of it left on the top of the bacon. I ended up scooping this off and making a brown sugar glaze to go over them. I enjoyed them, but probably more than anyone else I served them to.

A big hit at our Christmas party. I didn't sprinkle them with brown sugar because I thought that wouldn't taste real good. Next time I'll try it. A little labor intensive to wrap all the little guys, but they were definitely a hit.

I made these for a baby shower yesterday and everybody loved them, they were very easy to make, not time consuming at all.  thumbs up and five stars all the way.  I now can add this receipe to my everybody loves collection.  I was a bit nervous when a reader stated that the bacon and beef didnt taste that great together, but I asked a majority of the people if they had the same thought, and everyone said no, they were great.  I have to take the opinion of everyone that ate these because I am a vegetarian(spelling?) so I cant even test taste before I put them out.  I got great reviews and will make again.

Made these for a Super Bowl party I attended.  Took other suggestions and rolled the smokies in brown sugar, then wrapped with bacon.  When I put them in the crock pot I poured a mixture of melted brown sugar and maple syrup over them so the wouldn't dry out.  They were gone in minutes!!!  These are a heart attack waiting to happen, but well worth taking that chance!

We liked these a lot. We used our kitchen shears to cut the bacon into thirds before wrapping up the smokies. Really easy and really good! We turned them with about 10 minutes left just to get the underside more crisp. Ended up using the broiler at the very end to get them good and bubbly. Definitely will make these for a party! Heed the advice to line your cookie sheet with foil - makes cleanup super easy.

This was extremely easy to make and were a hit at a xmas potluck.  The brown sugar melts into almost a maple syrup (which might be a good substitute to make these a little more crispy)

These babies are finger-lickin' good! I took these to a potluck - it was the most popular item on the menu. I was the only one who didn't have leftovers to take home! The crockpot on lowest setting kept them at a nice temperature. I will definitely make these again! Also a great item for Superbowl parties, etc.!!!

Only change is I would only sprinkle brown sugar on the top when you roll them in the sugar it tends to burn the bottoms.

These were the hit of my Christmas party. Just remember don't keep them in a crock pot for a long long time because they get smaller the longer they are in the crock pot.

Will make again, next time I'm going to place all ingredients in a bag, in the fridge for a few hours before cooking, going to see if that helps coat the smokies in more sugar

this is a perfect blend of savory and sweet. It always gets raves. I think it's pretty easy to throw together. I did not roll each sausage in brown sugar just dumped it over. I did use the slow cooker to keep them warm for my party. Worked perfectly.

I replaced the Vienna sausages with beef lit’l smokies, turned out awesome. I saw someone mention some kind of horseradish dip, so I used a prepared creamy horseradish sauce from the store. Between my stepdaughter and I, it was gone in about an hour.

Very quick and simple to assemble.  You can make the bacon wrapped pieces ahead of time but only add the sugar before putting them in the oven.  Definitely put aluminum foil or parchment paper down for quick and easy clean up of the baking pan.  40 minutes and they were perfectly done.  Sweet and crunchy and yummy!  Everybody loved them and they went fast.

Used baking rack on foil lined cookie sheet. Makes cleanup easy and you can save the grease for later!  Ate them straight from oven so didn’t use slow cooker. Skipped the brown sugar to make more Keto friendly.

I cut down the amount of Brown Sugar, added some minced garlic, and smoke paprika. The paprika added an extra smokiness to them as well.

There being serious when they say generous amount. Add ALOT of brown sugar. I got a big package of lil smokies, cut a normal package of bacon into 4’s for each slice and ended up with two slices left. Turned out amazing!

We usually make 'Pig Candy', which is maple bacon dredged in brown sugar and then baked so that it caramelizes...YUM!  Then I ran across this recipe last year and WOW!  We get asked to make this now for gatherings and it is always the first to go! We  line the baking sheets with heavy foil for easy clean-up,  using use narrow metal skewers  that rest on the edges to elevate the little guys above the pan. This makes it easier to flip them and speeds up the process (we make A LOT at one time). When serving, we provide a little container of toothpicks for folks to use for spearing them out of the crock pot later. 

After reading some of the other reviews here, we are going to try putting a 1/2 cup of maple syrup in the crock pot this time - we usually don't put anything in and they go so fast it doesn't matter. 

Psst...always use the 'smokies' not the 'weiners' for the best taste!

**** Use bamboo skewers! ***** I’ve made this a few times. If you use skewers it makes prep so much quicker. You can then turn them very easily while cooking to make sure they don’t burn and keeps them evenly spaced out! When it’s done the bacon should have firmed enough so that you just slide them off of the skewers one at a time. I would also lessen the time of the cook but that will depend on your oven.  Note: can be prepped in advance just make sure to have some spare brown sugar to sprinkle on them before baking.

This has become a family favorite- I often make this as an appetizer to take places or as a fun holiday or party food. I cut the bacon in half, or sometimes in thirds to make it go further. Let's just say that whatever venue it is being served, there are never any left! I follow the recipe almost to a t, and it is great as it is! Only thing I have found is that I have to be careful baking it on "convection bake" as it dries it out, so just keep it on the regular "bake" setting on my oven. Yummy!

Labor intensive but well worth the effort! I made them for a potluck and they were gobbled up. I was hard pressed to get a couple of them myself.  Pull up a stool and roll away a lot of these - you'll need them!

I over-bought on "smokies" but the full pound of bacon was used (cut it into thirds). Filled a full cookie sheet and it all went FAST! Great side-protein for a carb-y breakfast casserole.

These were fantastic!  I was able to cut the bacon in quarters instead of thirds to make more.  I also used maple bacon which made it even better.  I turned them twice to make the bacon extra crispy.  My advise would be to sprinkle extra brown sugar on the top after the last turn.  They disappeared soon after hitting the table.  My husband had left foe a short period and came back to an empty dish.  I had put about 6 aside for him and some ate those too!

This is my third time  making these little gems. They are delicious. I didn't change any ingredients just a little different approach in the preparation.  I dump a half box (or a full box if doubling recipe) into a quart size ziplock bag. Throw in the cut bacon pieces and shake/knead around until all are coated with brown sugar. I prepare the foil lined pan ahead and lay out the toothpicks and wieners on the counter. This allows you to keep rolling and sticking without stopping to coat more bacon pieces. You can use the leftover brown sugar in the ziplock bag to sprinkle on top.  These are always a hit anytime I serve them. Try it ~ its worth the time and your sticky hands when done!!

I made these for a potluck and they were a smash.  I took several different reviewers' advice, and this is what I did: 1) Instead of cutting the bacon into thirds I simply rolled up the smokies in the bacon (I used maple flavored), used kitchen shears to cut the bacon, and then stabbed the smokies with toothpicks. 2) Foil line your cookie sheets for easy clean up. 3) I placed wire cooling racks sprayed with cooking spray on the cookie sheets and put the smokies on them.  Kept the smokies up off of the bottom of the sheet, and no need to flip them.  4) I cooked them the night before, and the day of the potluck I put them in the crockpot and started them two hours ahead on the low setting.  Came out perfectly.

I have made these dozens of times, you definitely NEED butter. Just enough to lightly coat the smokies...DO NOT DROWN THEM...about 1/2 a stick will do for this serving size...maybe a little less.

Ridiculously easy. I cut the whole pound of bacon  across the strips into 3 sections. This made each bacon piece just the right size to wrap around the smokies. 

People  LOVED THESE!!!!!  This is a can’t miss appetizer!

I was in charge of the appetizer for a dinner club of 16 people. Don’t know why I thought  a single recipe was enough!  Heads up, the smokies come about  40-50 per pack.   Since they’re  bite size, keep in mind how many you do want per person.

My five year old mastered the procedure in two tries and the two kids could finish the entire prep in less than 10 minutes. 
I do think the brown sugar didn't stay on as much and on the 3rd batch I sprinkled it on in the last 10 minutes and turned up the heat. That seemed to help. 
I thought it was fine and would make it again if it weren't so difficult and greasy. ;)

Everyone loved this, but I must say it was labor intense.  After wrapping the dogs in bacon and securing with toothpicks, I had a hard time getting the sugar to stick to them. I ended up with more sugar on the baking pan than on the dogs.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will shake the bacon and dogs in a plastic bag with the sugar as the last review suggested.

It’s true, these will disappear fast! I made these for a recent party for the first time. The recipe looked super simple but they are very messy to make. I took suggestions from others; coated the smokies in a plastic bag with brown sugar, cut the bacon in 3rds, wrapped each with bacon and secured with a toothpick with no need to wet them. Once wrapped, I double bagged them them in zip bags cause the toothpicks poked holes in the first, and marinated them overnight on a cookie sheet as extra protection against more leaks, flipping them a few times.
The next day I foil lined 2 cookie sheets with foil and placed cake racks on top sprayed with Pam and secured with the foil so they didn’t slip off the cookie sheet. Because I made so many (3 pkgs)  I packed them onto the racks so I could bake them all at once, poured all the marinade over them & sprinkled more dark brown sugar on, not heavy. I baked them at 350 for about 45 minutes, watching the last 10 minutes for any burning, then transferred them to a crockpot on warm. The foil helped with cleanup,  I didn’t flip them over while baking, the bacon cooked great and they stayed crispy! Will make again but won’t look forward to getting sticky!

I have made these forever.  Instead of expensive cocktail weiners, just cut regular weiners (any kind... beef, regular, turkey, whatever) in 3 or 4 pieces, wrap with bacon and follow instructions.  EVERYONE loves them.  If taking for a potluck, put them in a slow cooker to stay warm.  Congealed bacon fat is not that appetizing!

Everyone loves them.  If you make them during a party, people will eat them right off the cookie sheet as you remove them from the oven.  Time consuming to make, but worth it!  I also added maple syrup over them after removing from oven..

I used beef hot dogs and cut it into 3 pieces also took the bacon and cut it into 3 pieces to wrap around hot dog, I did not measure the brown sugar but I'm sure I added more than the recipe called for.  I've made this at several functions now and each time it it a hit and people can't get enough of it.

I'm glad I found this recipe  it's awesome, I've been making these for years and they are always gobbled up. When I go to gathering , almost every gathering people request them. I never make them without two or three people asking for the recipe! Yum, yum!

I guess I would make these for a party, but I don't think I would eat them myself. The sugar was so much overkill. But they were easy to make, and I'm sure they would be easy to please 90% of a crowd.

Our family has been making these for years.  A little time consuming wrapping each smokie but well worth it.  When attending a gathering everyone always asks when we walk through the door if we brought the bacon wrapped smokies!  T

Someone else called these "meat candies" and I think that's a very appropriate description of these things. It's a good thing they take so long to make or I would make them all the time and get fat eating them. If you're taking these to a party, make double the servings or they will all be gone in minutes and you will only get to eat 2 like me :(

These were wonderful the only thing that I would do different is not cook as long in the crockpot and not cook on high it is not necessary. What is important to do though is make sure you do turn them often otherwise the bottom ones get tough.

Quite the tasty little appetizers these are.  Next time I will look closer at reviews for cleanup tips though, as baking pan cleaning was quite the chore.  I have to admit that on the second round with leftovers I added some KC Masterpiece Original for a dipping sauce and was even more pleasantly surprised.

Loved the sweet and salty combo.  Wanted to make these for New Year's Eve and there weren't any beef cocktail wienies left on the grocery store shelf.  Had to opt for turkey cocktail wieners instead.  We couldn't tell the difference and it helped make these apps healthier. I tucked the bacon under the wiener and avoided using toothpicks.  The bacon stayed on without a problem. 
Definitely line the pain with foil to bake them- easy clean up.

I didn't eat these (vegetarian mostly) but those who did really liked these. I used Vienna Sausages for the weiners (they're made of chicken, I believe). Also, I used far less sugar.

I tried putting them in a bag, but would just put on a pan and then pour brown sugar over top. The toothpicks made too many holes in the bag.  I also cut the bacon in 1/4. Plenty to go around the links.  They turned out awesome. There were none left.

I made this dish with cranberry pork sausage bites and Applewood Smoked bacon. I had no more room in my oven so I decided to try it in my covered electric skillet. I cooked it on 300 degrees. They were awesome! My guests couldn't get enough and they disappeared quickly! My new favorite appetiser!

I made these for the first time for Christmas 2015 and they were a hit, only a couple left. They are delicious and addicting, will only be made for special occasions. 5 stars by my Beagles who were keeping a watchful eye for any dropped on the floor.

The sausage came out really good and everyone enjoyed them. I did change the recipe a little. I cooked them until they were done before adding the butter and brown sugar so that I could drain the grease off before adding the butter and brown sugar and they were a big ht.

These were a huge hit with our family for Christmas appetizer. I made just as is. I used Applewood smoked bacon. I did assemble them the night before and covered with foil and baked the next day. The brown sugar had liquified and pooled so I put them on another foil lined pan and sprinkled a little more brown sugar on top. The slow cooker kept them perfectly.

This was absolutely delicious and it was definitely a favorite. I used Boarshead bacon and it turned out beautifully. It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. These were everything I thought they would be and more. These are what dreams are made of. :')

I didn't think it took that long and it was pretty popular at my party. I froze the leftovers and warmed them up later. I should have done a better job of evenly distributing the sugar.

It was great.  Everyone loves it,  on a test batch I tried it with thick cut bacon and it was too greasy for us.  But with regular bacon it was perfect.

This is not a new recipe.  I got this from my mother in law about 35-40 years ago and have been making them since. Everyone who has them, raves about them. They're also surprised at how easy it is to make.

I have made these  but have always added pure maple syrup to the brown sugar then pouring it on the smokes.  They won't last, but you be the judge. Everything I make them there is never enough.  Remember PURE maple syrup not artificial. Add about a cup or more  roughly..

Drop the brown sugar and throw them on the Traeger or traditional grill! Serve with tangy or spicy BBQ sauce for dipping.

You can also try adding apricot preserves to the top of each smokie instead of brown sugar.  Just for something different.

I didn't find that it took near that long to prepare.  Also, 45 minutes seems right for cooking BUT after 25 minutes you should TURN THEM.

Delicious, easy and a BIG hit at the party!  After some tweaking, definitely a keeper!

I've made this several times and everyone loves it. I have started changing it up by adding about a Tbsp of chili powder or more depending on taste. I prefer to use precooked bacon because the cooking time is shortened to around 10 minutes and the bacon is very crisp. If you use uncooked only wrap the smoky with one layer of bacon so the outside is crisp. With the addition of chili powder this is by far the most popular appetizer at any event

I like to make elegant appetizers and this seems more ordinary but it disappears quicker than any I have ever made. I make it time and time again, always terrific.

Everyone wanted more.  I baked these on a foil covered cookie sheet in 350 degree oven for about 45 min.  I put them on bamboo skewers(remember to soak), the tips of the skewers fit on the edges of the pan, so the smokies didn't sit in the grease from the bacon.  No problem with getting the bacon cooked.  Didn't need the broiler.  I removed the smokies from the skewers before serving.
Thanks for the recipe!  Loved it!

I have made these many times, they are always the first to go at a party and I usually run out it seems no matter how many I make. Follow the recipe as written except they take a little longer to cook than stated , close to an hour.

Just made this for a 4th of July party we were invited to.  These were a HUGE hit and gone before I knew it.  Should have tripled the recipe in hindsight (only doubled it).  Used maple bacon which enhanced the flavor.  After rolling the smokies in the bacon and securing the toothpicks, I used another reviewer's suggestion of shaking these in a gallon size plastic bag with the brown sugar.  Baked at 325 degrees for 25 minutes (on a foil lined cookie sheet with folded edges to prevent drippings from spilling)and then 340 for 15 minutes longer.  Transferred to a disposable aluminum baking pan to transport and covered in multiple layers of foil to keep warm.  Again, HUGE hit (especially with the men at the party!!) and will be making these again in the future.

Excellent appetizer.  I agree to use thin lean bacon so they are not too greasy.  You can also set them on wire racks in the pan so the grease drains to the bottom (use foil lining).  Or you can set them on paper towels to drain after cooking.  They disappeared quickly and my 84 year old mother also ate a large share of these.  Will definitely make again.  I also rolled them the night before so all I had to do was put them in the pan, sprinkle on the brown sugar and bake.

I've made these several times now as they are always a hit.  It's a bit more expensive but I use the precooked bacon.  There's very little grease mess and it cut baking time in half.   Cut each slice in thirds.  Dredging in the brown sugar works really well, but I took a chance the last time and added a teaspoon of ground hot chili pepper to just 1/2 c brown sugar and mixed it in.  Also substituted little smoked sausages for the little wieners.  Prepared the night before and covered them on a tray in the frig.  Baked on a cookie sheet lined with non stick foil).  Made a dipping sauce of mayo, brown sugar and a chopped chipotle.  Both were gone before folks finished their first drink!

These are amazing!  My niece brought him to a party and they were so good I decided to make them tonight. I cut the bacon in 1/3...rolled the bacon around the sausage. I then rolled them in brown sugar. I did not need toothpicks to hold them. After 20 minutes of cooking at 325 I put the oven at about 450 and flipped them over putting a little more brown sugar on them. I will continue to make this recipe yum yum.

Made 4lbs of them for Super Bowl party and they were gone before the end of first quarter. Maybe it is my oven but I cooked them on 375 for 40 mins till the tops were turning dark. Also the first time I made them they were rolling around in the bacon fat. Now I use a boiler pan and the bacon fat drains to the bottom pan and then I transfer them to a crock pot. ( Hint- do not completely cover crock pot, they will get soggy)
I made them early and let them sit in frig a few hours before cooking. Before going in oven, I sprinkled more brown sugar and a small amount of cayenne pepper for a kinda kick.
The main thing is they cook so much better when you have them raised and out of the grease .  The people at the party could not get enough.

I've made this several times and the fat part of the bacon never cooks.   Love the flavors and have followed everyone's directions for cooking times, but the bacon either gets burned or is still fatty.   Any suggestions ?

i made these for thanksgiving appetizer and i am not being demanded to make them again for super bowl!  i added a little bit of chipotle seasoning to mine.  it gave it that little bit of extra something.  for the super bowl, i will add actual chiptole peppers (instead of seasoning mix) to it.

Loved them!  My oven was unavailable so I fried them on the stove and then sprinkled on the brown sugar-yum!

I made these for my daughter in laws baby shower, per her request.  Everyone loved them and they were the first to go.  I didn't use 3/4 cup brown sugar, in fact I didn't measure - just sprinkled the sugar over the tray of bacon wrapped smokies.  Keep an eye on them, I used thin sliced bacon and they were done in about 25 minutes.   Tip:  Wrap up the smokies early in the day or even the day before and place on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, cover with plastic wrap.  Right before baking, sprinkle with the brown sugar.   Parchment makes for easy clean up.

Made for my husband´s birthday. Everyone loves them. Especially bacon fans. I dredged the bacon in brown sugar then wrapped it around the smokies and used a toothpick to secure it.

I baked at 350 for 30 to 40 minutes and drizzled some brown sugar melted in warm water over them after they were finished baking. Great recipe!

Where I live we cannot get the wieners, so I buy the hotdog sized sausage and cut it appropreately to wrap with bacon! Since we don't have many smoked meats (they are expensive) I poured on liquid smoke.  The brown sugar, I skipped because I didn't want anything sweet that day.  All of that doesn't matter because I pigged out on this stuff!

Maybe its because I didn't grow up with pork, but I felt that this was not worth the effort.  My husband loved it, but he will eat anything.  He also grew up with pork and greasy stuff.

These were okay but just didn't over whelm us. We Prefer bacon wrapped dates or bacon wrapped olives. But agree they are a easy and probably tasty to a crowd.

Indeed a winner! I make them often now. I don't even use the toothpicks because I make so many at once and as a side dish for dinner (instead of just event finger foods). Great recipe!

All I can say is WOW.  These are deliciously yummy!  I will be making them for my next get-together.  I'm sure I'm going to need to double or triple the recipe! I'm not a huge fan of sausage OR bacon, but I LOVED these.  I just hope my boyfriend's friends don't want to come live with us after I serve them this!! :)

Awesome! I have not even got over to my party yet, and the hubby and I keep eating them. Only thing I did different was roll the smokies in brown sugar (after wrapping with bacon). Delicious! Thanks for the great recipe! Christina

It's rare that I make something based on good reviews and it's as good as everyone said! BUT THIS WAS!!!! Huge hit!    I read over TONS of reviews and everyone had ideas to make it better...but I was VERY strapped for time! (a lot of people said to shake up the weiners in brown sugar before wrapping, I didn't have time) I followed the recipe almost exactly but I did listen to some reviewers....I used maple flavored bacon, cut it into thirds, wrapped them around regular smokies, not weiners, because that's all they had (they weren't beef either), stucka  toothpick in them...then I put them on the cooling racks you would use to cool cookies, and put those on cookie sheets....I put a ton of brown sugar on them (mostly because it kept falling through the holes!)...but there was a good amount on there..I didn't measure, I just put a big chunk on each one....then I also followed some advice and baked them for 35 minutes at 325 then put the oven up to 450 for the last 4-5 minutes...they were delicious! Everyone loved them!!!!!

Based on reviews, I took a risk and made this for an orientation meeting for a ladies group.  There was a buffet table full of appetizers but my crock pot was empty by the time I got to it!  Imagine if there were men in the room!!

Served these for New Years, we all enjoyed them. Once we put them in the slow cooker, I added a tiny bit of BBQ sauce to keep them moist. They didn't last an hour among 15 people!

Made these for New Years Eve family at home celebration. They were okay. I think my son liked them more than I did. It took a while for the bacon to get crispy enough (maybe 5 additional minutes) and I did use a little less sugar than called for. Used regular little all beef wieners instead of smoked so maybe I would have liked it better with little smokies;

I love these! My boyfriend who is extremely picky loved these! The only thing I did different is I baked them on a broiler pan instead so the bacon fat could drip off and it could cook all the way through. I used a baking sheet once and the brown sugar stuck to the sheet so much that it almost didn't come off. Also, when I used the sheet the bacon didn't crisp enough for my taste. All in all, Ive been using this recipe for about a year now and its obviously a keeper!

I have always disliked cocktail wieners but this recipe converted me.  This is my new go to party recipe.  I had two packages of cocktail wieners so I cut the bacon in fourths, was able to make 1.5 bags this way.  Maybe I did something wrong but I didn't find a need to use toothpicks at all, just laid the smokies down seam side and used the same amount of brown sugar.  Putting them in the slow cooker seemed to finish the bacon to perfection.

Excellent!!!  My husband flipped for these, now he wants them every weekend & who am I kidding, so do I!!!  I did bake mine on racks in the pan so they were not swimming in grease.  When I put mine in the crockpot I did not want to pour the drippings from the pan over them (a friend did that & the results were really greasy) and I was afraid syrup would make them too sweet, so I poured a can of Pepsi in with them to keep them moist.  WOW, really added some flavor without being too greasy.   I think hubby would give them 10 stars, can't wait to make a batch for the next potluck at work!

I put the pack of smokies in a bowl first and let them marinade in brown sugar then wrap them in maple bacon and cover them in more Brown sugar to cook. Yummy!!!

I've made these for years, and they always disappear.  When the kids were younger, they'd be running in every 5 minutes or so with 'are they done yet?'.  I know they're a decadent treat, and I usually resist the desserts and hi-cal stuff, but I can't resist sneaking one of these!

These little guys have been well recieved at every party we bring them, in fact they are in high demand! They work great for potlucks, I can put them in a mini crock pot and they keep just fine, and are gone by the end of the event - If they aren't the first to disappear!

delicous, but pretty greasy. I didn't find that the smokies needed to be toothpicked - the bacon stayed wrapped around them just fine. One pound of center cut bacon will wrap two pounds (2 pkgs) of smokies.

Easy and ALWAYS a big hit. I bake at the recommended temp but I turn it up to 400 for the last 15 minutes.  If you use thicker bacon...really no need for the toothpicks.

If you are factoring simplicity into your rating this might be the best appetizer ever. I have brought this to many different functions and I have never brought even one home. I cook these a lot longer than the recipe calls for however. I like my bacon well done.

Made these for Super Bowl Sunday, they tasted great, but I am giving them only four stars because the cooking time was way off. I put them on a cooling wrack on top of a foil lined baking sheet, I turned them halfway thru and at the end of the cooking time, the bacon was still not done, I turned them again and cooked for 30 more minutes.  I will try and find extra thin bacon next time or bump up the oven temp.  But as far as taste, they are great.

These are officially called "Meat Candy" at our parties!  This couldn't be any easier and they are a huge hit, especially with men.  They are nice to serve as well since you can make them a few hours in advance, toss them in the Crock-Pot and they just get better.  Also, the toothpicks make them really easy for people to just reach in and grab one.  We have also made these at night and instead of tossing them in the Crock-Pot after the oven we just refrigerate them in a small foil tray and our hubbies have brought them down to tailgate with and just put the foil tray directly on the grill and let them warm up.  They are a favorite for tailgating now!

Wow- these were excellent.  I only made one batch and it was gone in no time.  I will make more next time!  I didn't measure the brown sugar, just dumped a good amount all over once assembled.  I did use toothpicks but I don't think they are really necessary.  Another review mentioned broiling these at the very end to make more crispy.  I tried that and that was a huge mistake.  I ended up burning them.  Lesson learned there.  Once done I put them all in a crock pot, juices and all.  My husband and son loved them!  Can't wait to make again!!

I have a major complaint  - now my family threatens not to come over unless I make these things! The nerve! Seriously, they are majorly delicious. I roll the smokies in real maple syrup before rolling in brown sugar, but they're also excellent without it. My family and friends devoured the last batch so fast that I only got one :(

I made this for my 13 yr olds murder mystery dinner party.  It was a great hit.  The kids loved assembling it in the morning.  I put them in a plastic bag to marinate in the fridge all day and then broiled for 15 min and served. This is now a favorite.  Thanks.

I did the marinade that was recommended and used dark brown sugar.  I also used Karo brown sugar syrup when baking them.  Just drizzle on top and it makes the most wonderful addition.  Even better than when I made these before...

Yummy! Yummy!  Yummy!  I put brown sugar in a bowl and threw in a few smokies at a time and tossed to coat.  I then sprinkled brown sugar on top and when they were nice and done, I used a spoon to scoop up some of the melted brown sugar from the pan and spooned it over the smokies in the crock pot.  They are absolutely wonderful!!!  A super easy treat to make :)

Kids love this recipe.  I have made these twice once for my mom's group & for a family bar-b-que.  My nephew was seen eating them by the handfuls!  I did have a mishap with covering the pan with foil, some of the sugar leaked under the foil I am still peeling foil off the pan!  I think it would have been an easier clean-up without the foil.

Yummy!  Takes a while to prepare, but worth it.  My husband's friends request these every time we have a get together.  Definitely line the pans with foil.  I use a broiling pan with the little slits in it to drain the grease. Oh, and don't make ahead and refrigerate because the brown sugar melts and the results aren't quite as tasty!

I made these for a Thanksgiving appetizer and these were all gone within mintues. I omitted the brown sugar because I do not like sweet taste mixed with meat.

This recipe is simple and makes a great treat for parties! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used center cut bacon, but had the strips cut in halves instead of thirds. Even though the bacon could stay on without toothpicks, I used them anyways for the sake of serving.

The one thing about these is that I was worried at first that I was putting on too much sugar-- But the more the better! If the sugar is ontop of the smokies (rather than 'around' them) they turn the bacon nice, bubbly and crispy! Definitely looking for another event to make these at!

I made this just like the recipe stated the first time...and it was good.  The second time I cut the bacon into fourths, used two pkgs of cocktail weiners, and added a little water to the brown sugar and poured it over the weiners.  I baked for an hour at 350 degrees...and they were very yummy!  They went fast at our Christmas party for my hubby's employees. Thanks for a great appetizer!

I made these twice so far.  The first time I wasn't sure how it would go over but I did it as the recipe calls, using the tinfoil others have suggested (good call btw).  They went over so well, super easy to prepare and gone in a flash.

The second time I made them I tried 1/2 w/o the brown sugar just to see.  To my surprise they weren't nearly as good as with the brown sugar, so don't leave that important part out.

I also told a friend about this, he made them for himself and his g/f and was raving about them to me the next day.

I made this for my dad's birthday party this past weekend.  They were a HUGE hit, everyone wanted to know what was in the sauce.  I have to say though for cooking for a crowd (we had over 70) they took a little more time than I would have like to have spent, but it was worth it.  I cooked the bacon half way in the microwave as suggested by another person and then wrap them and put in the fridge the night before.  If I had not done that I wouldn't have had the time to finish them.

Very good flavor. Here's what I did. I actually cut up bacon in fourths and it worked fine.  I put two smokies to one toothpick. I then put brown sugar is a sandwich baggie and then put the smokies in there to coat them well. Be careful not to poke holes in the baggie. I then put on the broiling pan in the oven. They were still a bit greasy, but most of the grease drained to the bottom.  I think there was still some grease only because I doubled the recipe and packed the broiler pan FULL.  **IF YOUR BROWN SUGAR IS HARD YOU CAN PUT IT IN A MICROWAVABLE DISH AND PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE--PUT A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER IN A GLASS OR CONTAINER IN THE MICROWAVE ALSO. MICROWAVE IN THIRTY SECOND INTERVALS UNTIL IT GETS SOFT ENOUGH TO BE USABLE, MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T MELT--

These were awesome!!! I made these for a super bowl party and everyone loved them. I bought the pre cooked bacon and microwaved it just until soft, cut in half and the wrapped the smokies and dipped in the brown sugar, then I put them under the broiler for a few minutes, inserted a toothpick into each one and then transferred to a slow cooker to stay warm. YUMMY!! Try these, you will love them.

My father-in-law said it best, "You can't go wrong with an all-pork appetizer!"  They do take a little time to make, but my kids were so excited to help that we did it all in about 15 minutes.  Definitely a keeper!

My friends can't get enough of this appetizer! I prefer to make them with turkey bacon, I think it gives them more flavor! I've even tried the smokies with  cheddar in the middle and they are just as good! Always the first plate cleaned!

These were very good as they are.  I did however, roll the bacon in the brown sugar after it was wrapped around the smokie and I sprinkled more ontop as they baked.  I also baked them on a Pam sprayed rack so that they bacon would crisp up better and the grease would fall on the foil lined cookie sheet for easier clean up.  I then put them in a crockpot with Open Pit BBQ sauce and a small can of drained crushed pineapple and a little more brown sugar.  They were a big hit!

Pretty tasty.  Time consuming, however.  Brown sugar blacked the bacon pretty quickly so they didn't look too pretty on the table.  Had to convince friends to try it, but once they did, they enjoyed it.

I've been making these for a couple years now.  I can honestly say that they are in high demand for get-together events - everyone just loves them!!!  I always use the beef smokies, center cut style bacon, and dark brown sugar for these (with a really good tin foil setup for easy cleanup in the pan!).  YUMMY!  Thanks for the recipe =)

They were good, and everyone liked them a lot. The second batch I made, I turned them mid-cooking so the bottoms didn't get too crisp. And I can't say this enough...use CENTER CUT bacon...the other is just way too greasy!

I made these for a candle party this week, all women and there was not one left!  So easy to make but they raved about them and everyone asked how I made them.  I didn't bother to use the toothpicks when making them, just put the end of the bacon side down and the bacon stayed wrapped even when I took them out of the pan and put them on teh plaste.  I'll be making these alot in the future.  Very Very tasty!

Delicious and easy to make. Not as time consuming as I imagined.  They need a lil extra time to bake.  Sauce recommended by another reviewer was delish. I will definitely make these again.  Real easy crowd pleaser!

This is a huge favorite at my house.  I use maple bacon, and in the last 10 minutes of the process I pour maple syrup over the smokies.  They disappear at a very rapid rate.  A good party food.

This is a great recipe because it is very tasty and easy to make.  I used little smokie sausages and about half the brown sugar and it still tasted good.  I will make it again.  Next time I will try putting the smokies in a plastic bag with the brown sugar and shaking it to coat them(as someone else suggested).

So good it'll give you a heart attack!  Seriously, these were the first appetizers to go when I made them, and they tasted GREAT!  But I'm not used to eating a lot of grease, so my stomach was a little upset later in the day.  Now that I'm feeling okay, I want more of these. :)

I've always done these directly in the Crock Pot. Place them in cold, pour the brown sugar on top, then place it on high. I watch it until the sugar starts melting down into the smokies, then, I put it on medium, and stir them periodically. Stirring keeps most any of them from burning, and saves moving them from oven and pan to the Crock.

I normally make these for all family get togethers and parties. Recently, we had a housewarming party, and although these were on the menu, I ran out of time. Everyone told me that I wasn't allowed to omit them from the menu again. I love them, and knew everyone else loved them, but I got glares when they found out I didn't make any. Always make double the amount than you think you need. They go very fast!

Yum!! I may have overcooked them just a tad, but they were still so good! I didn't put as much brown sugar on as asked, just because we don't like real sweet stuff. I used about a forth of a cup, and it was perfect! Heated up some leftovers for lunch today, and they were still pretty tasty, although they were a little greasy.

I tried 3 new recipes from this site today, this being one of them. I used a broiler pan lined with foil. I couldn't seem to get the bacon as crisp as I like. After taking them out of the oven and realizing that there was no way my husband would eat undercooked bacon, nor would I, I placed them back in under the low broiler for about 5 minutes. I have them in the crockpot now with a mixture of brown sugar & maple syrup. I think they are wonderful,and so does hubby.

I thought these were good - not great.  I like my bacon crispy, and I couldn't seem to crisp the bacon without burning the bottoms (which I had to throw a few away because bottoms were burnt so be careful).  However, my company raved about them.  I doubled the quantity, and they all went.  Not sure if I'd make again, because I didn't care for them.  They were a hit though.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe for 3 different parties and everytime the crock pot comes home clean.  I use much more brown sugar than the recipe calls for.  I have people asking for the recipe all the time. Excellent!!!

People ask me to make these for every party I go to now! I have a bit of a variation on it though! I disolve the brown sugar in honey on the stove then pour it over of the wrapped smokies. I also use maple bacon which gives great flavor. I have a dish of honey mustard for dipping too!

Those slow cooker liners are FABULOUS when it comes to clean up later too!

These were great. Next time I will follow the suggestions of others and put them in a large baggie and shake them around a bit for better coating and I will try the dip suggested. Will make again for Christmas!

I made these last year for a Xmas family gathering. My husband and I enjoyed them a great deal, however...my crock pot was still pretty full by the end of the evening. Maybe a little to greasy looking for some people? I just do not know why they were not a hit.

These were very tast and a great "finger food" at our party.  I urge you to watch it carefully while it cooks because it was done quickly (at least in my oven) and a bit over-ccoked.  This wasn't a tragedy, though, because it made them crispier with more texture.  They were also a bit time consuming to wrap-up so be sure to put on a good tv show or music before you get started!

Why is this considered a slow cooker recipe? These never last long enough at my house to warrant serving in the crockpot. Just pile on a plate and tell the guests to get em while they're hot! You'll be shocked how fast these little buggars disappear. :) My stomach's growling just thinking about them...

These are AWESOME.  I made them for every party we attended this year.  The only problem was that they disappeared so quickly that my husband complained that he never got to have enough, so now I make extra and leave some at home.

These were very good- but a bit greasy for my taste so  I could only eat a few. I did make a couple with turkey bacon that I mixed in with the regular bacon dogs.

Sinful indulgence!  Fairly quick and easy.  Family couldn't stop eating them, even after the meal was over.  Do line the pan with heavy foil to make clean-up a breeze.  Wonderful!

These are great.  You will need about ten people to consume them all.  Might be a little hard on the arteries.

This was not a fav of mine. It was partially my fault since I had frozen bacon, had to defrost it in the micro and it got WAY TOO hard to work with.  It was warm and MUSHY.  yuk.  the end result did not get the best reviews.  The bacon didnt seem done enough, even though I left it in for longer then called for, and they were very salty.  However, most of the men liked them and luckily gobbled them all up ;)

They are great!  They do take some time to prepare but they are easy to make.  I had 3 requests for the recipe by the end of the Super Bowl.  Thanks for sharing!

These are a bit time consuming, but well worth it, when you see them disappear so fast from the appetizer try!! Definately not low fat, however!
