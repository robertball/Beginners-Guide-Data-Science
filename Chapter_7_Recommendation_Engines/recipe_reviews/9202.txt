This is the recipe I use.  I never had the measurements either, Mom taught me the same, add till it looks right.  I use the large bag of Pepperidge Farms herbed stuffing crumbs, so yummy.  They are dry so I add chicken broth to moisten.  Dont drain the sausage after cooked, add it to the mixture for extra flavor.  Happy Turkey Day!

I made this for a big get together I had, and made it in the crock pot.  I continued to add broth as it cooked, and I used a few different breads (what I had on hand, I like options).  So easy!  And good!  It is almost as good as my Grandmother's (and hers has almost started fights at Christmas).  I made a vegetarian version too, and that was also a hit.  I'll be using this recipe again.

Great recipe!  I used one loaf of white bread and one loaf of wheat bread - didn't use the end pieces.  I toasted every slice and cut off all the crusts, then cubed.   I only used one scant teaspoon of poultry seasoning and added one teaspoon garlic pepper.  I didn't have any sausage drippings - so I used more butter than listed.  If I had baked this as a side dish - I might have had to add more liquid (chicken broth).  But - since I baked it in the turkey (12 lb.)- no additional liquid was needed.  It came out perfectly!!!!!!!!  This is the recipe I will use from now on.  For variety - I might try using "hot" sausage next year - or maybe a different type of sliced bread (potato??).  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!

Best stuffing ever! I substituted Sweet Italian sausage for the breakfast sausage. Instead of stuffing the bird I put the stuffing in a crockpot and added a little chicken stock to moisten and cooked it on high for about an hour. Simple recipe, and it got the most compliments. This one definitely goes into my recipe box!

I really like this stuffing.  I toasted the bread until very dry.  Greased a 9x13 pan, baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  I basted it with the dripping from my chicken twice during the 45 minutes and it came out perfect.  This will be the recipe I use from now on.  No more boxed stuffing.

Yeah, this one is a definite keeper. The flavor is as good as any dressing I have ever had. I prepared mine in a slow cooker. Since I doubled the recipe, until the bread compacted, it barely fit into my large slow cooker. That's okay, as the stuffing cooks, it will shrink, giving you a little space at the top to stir the ingredients. As another reviewer suggested, I used turkey drippings to enhance the flavor and help the dressing maintain the right consistency (not dry out). I started the dressing on high, but lowered it to low, and then warm once we started eating. Cooking this in the slow cooker allows one to prepare the dressing far in advance. When on high, if you give it time between stirrings, the dressing forms a nice little crust where the bottom and side walls meet, which will be pleasing to any diners that enjoy a little crunch in the dressing. What a great recipe. This one rocks. An easy five stars!

This stuffing was all right, but the major problem with it is that I tried to stuff my turkey with this, and it ended up very wet.  Almost too wet.  It was MUCH better outside of the turkey. It was not at all reminiscent of my mom's recipe, which I think I'm going to stick with.  Sorry.  :-(

This is just like what my mom always made.  Exact ingredients only my job was turning the grinder that attached to the table.  She never precooked anything though.  I remember my eyes burning grinding those darn onions but I wouldn't give up that job for anything!  LOL!   In mom's honor (she passed last month) we made this stuffing.  We did not saute anything, we added fresh parsley, I made my own bread for the cubes and we cut the butter back to 1/4 cup and used homemade broth (mom did) in its place.  I also used my home made sausage links and added some garlic per the Hubs request.  Thank you for bringing back those flavor filled memories.

This Stuffing comes from the old country Scotland that is. I've made this recipe my whole adult life. MY mother taught me this and hers taught her. If you try you'll buy guaranteed. 5*****

This was fantastic.  Everyone said it was better than my mom's and that is the ultimate compliment.  I deviated a little by adding 1/2 can of cream of celery and 2 cans of mushroom pieces/stems.  It couldnt have been tastier!!

Fantastic!  Easy and delicious.  We halved the recipe; big mistake because we want more! Did not use to stuff turkey.  Cooked in a 2qt casserole dish at 350 for 40 min.

I used Pepperidge Farm herbed bread crumbs instead of bread and put this in a crockpot. I added enough chicken broth to make the bread crumbs wet and cooked it on high for about 2 hrs then low 2 more hours. The beautiful thing about it is you can add more broth  if it starts to dry out. I made this along with traditional bread dressing and this recipe won hands down. Will make every thanksgiving from now on!

The only change we made to this stuffing was to use 2 tsp. poultry seasoning instead of 3 tsp. which was perfect. This is such an easy recipe, and everyone devoured it. I think next time, I might try to make it in the crockpot. Definitely a keeper.

Good recipe.  The only thing I think missing from the actual recipe is some liquid.  I had to add chicken stock to this before baking.  Other than that, great!!

This was AMAZING...definitely everyones favorite dish for Christmas dinner. I only made a few adjustments: 1. I added about 1-2 teaspoons of salt to the recipe 2. For the bread cubes I used a little more than half a loaf of Franz white bread. I bought it about 5 days ahead of time so that it wasnt too soft and I toasted the bread in the oven on broil, about one minute each side on a middle rack. 2. We had ham, so I couldn't actually stuff the stuffing. Instead I buttered (with actual butter) a 9 by 13 inch glass pan, filled it with the stuffing and covered with aluminum foil. I baked it on 350 for about 35 minutes. No additional drippings or chicken broth was needed.  The recipe turned out great, moist with crispier pieces on top. My friends and family raved and went back for seconds and thirds. Next time I will double the recipe :)

First let me saw I am NOT a stuffing person.  But I needed a recipe for tomorrows dinner and decided to make it a day ahead.  This recipe was so easy to make and is incredibly delicious - made a stuffing lover out of me!!  I made it in the crock pot (1 hr, high) and added close to 3 cups of chicken broth. Can't wait to share it tomorrow!

I have been using this exact recipe for 20 years now. It has always been a hit, and the only complaint is that I never made enough!
I now triple this recipe. Fabulous dish anytime, but extra special with Thaksgiving dinner.

I make a similar version but to make it easier I used boxes of stove top stuffing, 3 cornbread 1 turkey and instead of water i use chicken broth and also add canned mushrooms to it.  It has been a hit and family favorite for years.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and used one loaf wheat and one loaf white bread as stated in an earlier review, then my husband suggested I use sage flavored sausage, which was amazing.  The best mistake came when I unknowingly added pineapple juice right before baking instead of chicken broth to have moist stuffing, I didn't want it too dry.  It was so good and everyone raved about it.  So I suggest sage sausage and pineapple juice, I'll make it again next year!

My Mom always made this except somewhere along the line the sausage got substituted for hamburg - probably due to cost. I ususally combine both. If not stuffing the bird, I don't use as much butter but do use some chicken or turkey stock to moisten it up. I have also used bagged bread stuffing cubes, rather than make my own (sometimes, anything to save time). Either way - Thanksgiving is just not the same without this stuffing at my house...yum!

My family LOVES this stuffing. The base recipe works well with apples and raisins instead of sausage too, yummy! This is the same stuffing recipe my mom taught me years ago, only she never gave me measurements. "Add this until it looks right..." LOL. I'm so glad to have had someone else figure out proportions!  Now when guests ask for the recipe, I can give it to them!!  :-)

Easy and delicious. I did have to add some chicken broth because my was a bit dry but that may have been my error. Had some the next day as leftovers because this was such a large batch and I felt the flavors were even better on day 2.

Made this for Thanksgiving for my boyfriend who loves stuffing.  I browned the sausage  and then put it all into my crockpot which turned out great!  It was really good, and I don't care much for stuffing.

I toasted and tore some slices of bread instead of using actual bread cubes and it turned out great.

This is the recipe I use except I never cook the sausage first. I just crumble in the bread mixture and then bake as usual.

I've been using this stuffing also without proportional amounts. I also add 1 pkg. of defrosted creamed spinach and I use loose fresh sausage instead of patties.  My family loves it.

We make a very similar stuffing except that we use the Pepperidge Farms dry herb seasoned stuffing mix, add diced onions, diced celery, raisens, diced apples,crumbled spicy sausage, and lots of poultry seasoning.  It's then moistened very well with chicken or turkey stock before we stuff the bird and/or put in a baking dish for extra stuffing.  It's one of my families favorites for Thanksgiving and haven't had another kind that we like as much as this one.

Perfect stuffing just as the recipe is written.  The turkey was stuffed and the extra went into a glass rectangular casserole about 8x11 and baked uncovered for 40 minutes.  It was crispy edges and moist center.  Delicious.

Used 1/2 cornbread and 1/2 white bread crumbs. This is very similar to the stuffing my dads family has been making for years.  Added a little cream, and more seasoning.

Greta recipe! I didn't stuff the bird with it. Instead I baked it in a pan so had to add chicken broth for the moisture and it turned out great! I also didn't toast my bread, but that is a personal preference. Why toast bread you're going to put moisture in? Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome. Added 2 small gala apples and a can of chicken broth since I was going to cook it in a crock pot for 1.5 hrs on high. Used 4 cups plain bread cubes and 4 cups corn bread stuffing mix. Was asked for the recipe. Definately need to mix with hands to get the correct consistancy. Thank you for the recipe.

This stuffing was SO amazing. I used sage-flavored Jimmy Dean sausage and "all purpose seasoning" and is was definitely a favorite on the table! It was my first ever attempt at stuffing and it tasted WONDERFUL!

This recipe is VERY similar to one that
my Mom passed down to me with no proportions. Changes are: 1/2 pound of sausage, 1/2 onion, the LIVER of the
turkey chopped EXTREMELY FINE, and one egg.  This is my families favorite part of the bird! :-))

This was pretty good. Easy to assemble and pretty much cut and dry. Everyone ate it up with no issues whatsoever.
My youngest son helped, which was a treat for both he and I. I think I added too much salt this time. If I were to make it again, I'd cut back on the salt.

I'd make this again, when I didn't want 
my father in law's giblet stuffing. I still have two other turkey's to make before next Thanksgiving!

Love, love, love this stuffing recipe.  Everyone eats it all.  Put some in the bird, and some in a separate dish.  The only change I made was to add a bit of Bell's seasoning as I just don't think stuffing tastes the same without it!

I did make a few changes but this is a great basic recipe that you can easily adjust to your taste.  I added 6 sliced fresh mushrooms and 1/4 cup of dried cranberries.  I also cooked it in the crock pot for 1 hour, started on high and turned to low after about 30 minutes.  I also topped it with a 1/2 cup of chicken broth just before cooking.  I will definitely make this again!

This stuffing is delicious but made a slight modifications. I enjoy my stuffing with less bread and more meat so I doubled the amount of sausage while keeping the same 8 cups (about 2 loaves) of bread. With the meat doubled I used a whole stick of unsalted butter. I baked as suggested in comments for 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Came out great. I might add a bit of mint as well as diced pickles next time for a little extra kick

Really good, though I'd watch over cooking the sausage, which is evidently easy to do!

Great recipe but next time I will cut the sausage in half (use1/2#).  I also added an apple diced up and it added a nice flavor.  I didn't get much grease from my sausage so I had to use more butter.  My family really loved it.

Pretty good!! I cooked it in the oven as I didn't make a turkey this year. I had to add about 3 cups of stock and baked at 350 for about 30 mins. I really couldn't taste the sausage though...It could have been so much better for the amount of time it took!!

I made this stuffing, did not stuff in turkey, it came out extremly dry!! I am not sure what I did wrong, I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was great however, which is why I gave it 4 stars...perhaps I did something wrong...I will probably not make again, even though the flavor was good to me, guests thought it was "off".

I really liked this.  I stuffed my Thanksgiving turkey with it and baked the rest in a casserole.  My only criticism is that it is a little too salty.  I think I might not use quite so much sausage next time.  Otherwise, it was very tasty and worth making again.  Also, it's quite easy to prepare.  I recommend this recipe!

This was an excellent recipe!  My husband requested sausage stuffing like his mother makes, and this recipe came very close.  I made my bread cubes too large, so it needed a little stock added to it.  Otherwise, it turned out very tasty, especially in the bird!  Thanks so much!

Great recipe for a stuffing amateurs especially with the other reviewer notes.  I was serving this with smoked chicken so I was not able to stuff a bird. I also added one apple chopped.  Otherwise I followed the prep directions.  I used my smaller roaster pan lined with parchment paper and covered the pan with tin foil.  I baked mine for an hour at 350 deg. Without the bird body for moisture, I added chicken broth to baste it every 20 min until it was steaming on its own.  It was so good. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds.

This is the recipe I use every year. Everyone loves it. I double the recipe using 1 pound of sage breakfast sausage and 1 pound of hot breakfast sausage. Butter instead of margarine. The doubled recipe just barely fits into a 5 quart crockpot. I add several cups of homemade turkey broth and pack it down to fit. I heat on low for an hour before dinner. Sometimes I’ll add breadcrumbs to the top and stick under the broiler before serving.

Our favorite sausage stuffing recipe! I also love to use the Pepperidge Farm cubes with chicken broth. One thing I would say is to be careful about which brand of chicken powder you use because not all are created equal and you may be in for an overly salty surprise! I always check the sodium content now ??

Holy smokes, this was a hit! I have never made stuffing from scratch before and was worried it would be a mushy bomb, but this was fantastic! Only changes I made were substituting precooked sausage links (chopped - it’s all I had) for fresh breakfast sausage, and added chicken broth up front and then as needed when I baked it in the oven. Leftovers were superb, again drizzled with just a bit of broth to moisten before reheating in oven. Oh, and I used butter instead of margarine since that’s what we prefer. Will try making in the crockpot next time. Highly recommend!! Thank you!!

Very good to use as guidance...I added poultry heavy in place of water. Also added butter to mix in frying pan before adding dried out bread. BEST stuffing ever with those changes!

Loved it.  I'm not a big fan of sweet stuffing so this was perfect match. Simple and full of flavor.  I had small 14 lb turkey so used about 3/4 required bread but it was still perfect.

I live in Vietnam so I couldn't find the best sausage to really make this dish shine. But it still turned out very good. I toasted the bread as other recommended and found I only needed about 1 loaf instead of the 2 suggested. I cooked it outside the turkey and add some chicken stock to keep it moist. Overall very easy and good result.

Mom taught me this one. You have to use Jimmy Dean Sage sausage, and season the bread cubes before adding other ingredients. No need to measure; just sprinkle in some poultry seasoning, shake a little, and smell. You'll know when the spices are right!

This is a good base for stuffing/dressing. I used Italian sausage, casing removed. Cooked in the oven, as others suggested by others, at 350 for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. I needed extra liquid when stirring, so I used diluted white wine. Added 3/4 finely diced apple, and seasoning came with dried bread cubes. After 30 minutes, added a little more liquid and stirred again, then covered with foil to keep the moisture in. Worked great!

Positively addicting. I did not actually stuff the turkey with it but rather dabbed top with butter and baked at 350 for 30 min.

Great recipe and a hit at our Friendsgiving dinner.   I was asked for the recipe.  I cooked it in the crockpot for about an hour on high and added small amounts of chicken broth while it cooked. It came out nice and not too wet or too dry.   This was the first time I ever made stuffing that didn't come from a box. :)  I read many reviews but didn't see any advice on how small to make the bread cubes.   I ended up cutting the bread vertically and horizontally about 5 or 6 times each piece. That seemed to be just right.  Also a note on the sausage. I didn't have many drippings so I squeezed a little out.  Not sure if this is a great cooking method, but it worked for me. I ended up with about 1/4 cup of drippings that way.  I will definitely make this stuffing again.

Made it with only one tsp poultry seasoning and chopped up another 1 tsp of fresh sage. Also added about 1 Tbsp minced garlic.  Did not stuff into turkey but did the crock pot suggestion and left it on high for an hour or so, putting a cup of chicken broth in the bottom.  Stuffing came out flavorful and moist but not sticky.  Will do this again and maybe double it as I wish we had more leftovers!

This stuffing recipe is out of this world good. Made a double batch. We made turkey breasts instead of a whole turkey so we put the stuffing into a pan and placed that pan inside of a bigger one and put chicken broth instead of water. Covered the stuffing and baked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour. It will be our new traditional stuffing from now on!

I made it with 1/2 C Canola and 2/3 stick of butter. We don't do margarine in this house. The butter doesn't burn, when mixed with oil, sauteing the onions and celery. Then we baked it in a 11x9 pan at 350 for 30 minutes covered with foil. Had considered browning the top at the end of the bake but since it was my first time using this recipe I chose to go conservative so I wouldn't dry it out. Next time I will try browning it. The stuffing came out great. Wife says it's a "10." Looking forward to playing around the recipe in the future but it was fine as is.

This was perfect! One of those recipes I always took for granted would be there for me from my mom, but hasn't made it onto a recipe card yet! I was able to get exactly 8 cups of bread crusts from making cucumber sandwiches for a tea party, so it was an AllRecipes double-score for me! http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Easy-Cucumber-Party-Sandwiches

This was an amazing recipe even though I had to wing it because I did not have poultry seasoning or white bread cubes. I had 3 bags of stuffing mix (which has seasoning in it) and I toasted some wheat bread. I used Bob Evans savory sage sausage and I just threw the butter, celery, and onions in and sauteed them right with the the sausage after the sausage was cooked through enough since time was REALLY getting away from me. With these basic ingredients, and having to throw caution to the wind with a time and ingredient crunch, it still came out amazing. I buttered a cake pan and made it out of the bird and basted it with turkey dressing and my friend, who is a stuffing fanatic, high fived me and asked for the recipe. Thank You for such an awesome recipe! No more bland stuffing in my house!

Made it day before Thanksgiving so the flavors would blend. We ate it all up and we are making the second batch for tomorrow. Per other reviews I used chicken broth so it wasn't dry, in the oven for 40 minutes at 350! Thank you for this recipe, easy to make it your own!

Have made this twice in one month (Thanksgiving and an early Christmas). Sooo good!  Made it in the slow cooker the first time to keep just the turkey in the oven - was very convenient, no fussing over it.  (the second time was in the oven and had to broil it for a bit to get the bread crispier). Used maple sausages to add a little extra yummy, otherwise didn't change a thing.

Easy to make.  My stuffing ended up being very dry and separated rather than all mixed together.  Make sure you check on the stuffing frequently when cooking and add broth as necessary ( I did not, I think that's why it was dry).  Good flavoring though.

This was a little heavy on the sausage. The flavor was great though and I will probably make it again, but maybe cut back on the sausage a bit.

OK....I followed this EXACTLY with NO changes and it was the worst Iv ever made and for the last 35 yrs of making stuffing, my husband did'nt eat it. I made my own bread cubes and everything (which I normally use Mrs Coub or Pepp farm). Very greasy tasting everyone said. Anyway, No thanks, I will use my box and some broth next time....

Little dry for my liking so next time I'll add a little more liquid. Very tasty though and will make it again with alterations.

this was the closest recipe that I could find that matches the stuffing my Mom made.  This was a hit and now a Christmas tradition for my family.

This is the recipe that my family has made for decades.   I am so glad to have it all written down.   I like using the 1 pound roll of bulk breakfast sausage.   I find that starting the sausage in about a cup of broth or stock helps it break up and helps to avoid browning.   I add about 1/2 cup of finely chopped carrot to the onion and celery.  I also use a combination of soft bread cubes and hard bread cubes.   Like another reviewer said, you'll know when it's right.  This stuffing recipe gets rave reviews every time.
