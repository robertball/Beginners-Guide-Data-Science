So I'm not a big bean fan but in the interest of following the recipe, I left them. To my surprise, you couldn't taste them. The chili itself was AMAZING though. It was really tasty and the chili itself was full of flavor. With winter coming, I have a feeling this is going to be one of our go to recipes on cold nights!

Too much spice for me, so I reduced the amount of chili powder significantly. Otherwise, it was really good with some saltines on top!

So simple, easy and tasty.

I am living in Europe and sometimes have trouble finding the ingredients that I need to make some of my favorite comfort foods.I also do not have access to all of the equipment as I am living in student housing. 

This was a GREAT recipie, with my handicaps, or reguardless.

Tomatoes with chiles were not available so I got some little hot pepers in a jar and diced about 3, this was enough it was warm, almost too spicey for me.  I also used the Knorr beef broth that comes in concentrated form, one packet was perfect diluted in hot water. I meant to put cilantro in, but purchased parsley instead, tossed a bit in, this was also great, although I think I will try cilantro next time. I also let it sit for about 5 min or so, it thickened up wonderfully.

I liked this chili.  it had a good flavor, especially with the green chilis, but it was watery, even after letting it simmer for twice the amount of time it called for

The beauty of this recipe is that it does not require any prep. Every ingredient comes from a can or box. No chopping onions or tomatoes. I used 2 cans of black beans for 1 pound of beef, and added salt to taste at the end. Delicious and quick.

I was interested in finding a chili recipe that both my kids and my husband would enjoy.  This was pretty good but like other reviews I found something missing.  I added a can of rinsed red kidney beans and added 1 teaspoon of ground cumin. This gave the broth more flavor and calmed down the spiciness of the chili powder for my kids. I think next time I will also add 1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander.

I liked this, but my kids didn't. I didn't use chili powder or broth.  I would make it again. Super easy!

Quick and easy, this was a tasty chili.  I added red kidney beans to the mix and it was perfect for us.

This was good stuff, but I do tend to like *boring* chili like my mom used to make.  I used kidney beans in place of black beans because that's what chili is in my world and had to call an audible and sub tomato sauce for the beef broth when I discovered we were out of broth (which I think gave it a perfect consistency!).  While I appreciate the simplicity and what I think of as "chili", there was a little something missing, but I can't decide what.  Beef, it's what's for dinner!
