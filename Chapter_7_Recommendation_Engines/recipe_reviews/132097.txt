This recipe was delicious!  I did make a few adjustments.  Instead of green onions, I caramelized a sweet yellow onion; this went great with the sweet potato!  Also, I did not fry the tortillas.  I heated them up in the microwave in my tortilla warmer for about 45 seconds.  Finally, I do not care for red enchilada sauce so I created my own sauce.  I mixed green chili sauce with a mashed avocado, 1/2 a cup of sour cream and half a cup of cilantro (blended w/food processor).

This recipe sounded weird, but I had sweeet potatoes that needed using, and a taste for Mexican food! It was great! But it made too much. I used flour tortillas because that is what I had on hand, and reduced fat cream cheese. I ended up with 6 large enchiladas and a lot of left over filling. Next time I will cut the recipe in half. I served it with a garbanzo bean salad I threw together with diced red onion, quartered cherry tomatoes, salt, pepper, red wine vinegar and oil, and some fresh parsley. My picky roommate loved it!

I reduced the recipe (cooking for 3 instead of 6) but kept the full measurement of spices, and I'm glad I did because otherwise I think it would have bland. So...3 sweet potatoes filled 12 small tortillas. The texture reminded me of a tamale. I will make this again, but I think I might actually throw in some cinnamon to the filling - I always sprinkle on my sweet potatoes and it just seemed to be missing. Thanks for the recipe.

These sounded very strange at first, but they turned out very good - I did add cooked chicken breast, though!  I did not fry my tortillas (too much fat).  I also did not make enchilada "rolls".  I just layered the items in a 10X14 pan.  I doubled the spices to our satisfaction.  I topped it with paprika, parsely, diced red pepper, & sliced black olives.  This one is a keeper!  I needed to use up some "going old" sweet potatoes and this was just the thing!

I did make a few itty bitty changes.... to start with I only used 4 sweet potatoes (I only had that many), I doubled the seasonings and used 6 green onions (green & white parts).  
I did NOT fry my tortillas! In my opinion corn tortillas need to be lightly toasted to bring out their full flavor potential, however doing so makes them crispy and next to impossible to roll... Solution? Dip them in the enchilada sauce= instant rollability. :)  So just use a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and let them get slightly golden (takes like 5 seconds). Dip and ready for rolling. 
I used hot enchilada sauce which was delicious!!!  These are on our menu often from now on.
I should have mentioned above... these made more than 12 enchiladas, I got 24 out of the amount of filling with 4 sweet potatos.

Great!  I used flour tortillas because I hate corn tortillas.  Next time I'll omit the enchilada sauce and either use green sauce or just extra cheese.  I also might toast them in a frying pan rather than bake them, and then melt cheese on top so that they'll be crispy.  The filling is truly fantastic, though.  I tripled the amount of spice the recipe called for and it was anything but bland.

This recipe was just awesome!! I did make two changes just to make a few steps easier. I peeled & cut up the potatoes before I boiled them. Totally cut down on the cooking time. I also put the corn tortillas on a baking sheet & put them in the oven for two minutes. Made them easy to roll & there was no grease involved. My husband said it was the best thing he ever ate! I make this on a weekly bases.

This recipe was very good, my family loved it.  It does make a lot though, so have some extra tortillas on hand to make more.  We wound up dipping Blue Corn Chips into the leftover filling.

This is probably one of the best recipes I tried from this site.  I used a leftover baked sweet potato from a restaurant and two whole wheat tortillas. Other than those two changes, I followed the recipe and adjusted the seasonings accordingly.  I had no idea of what to expect as far as taste and boy was I wonderfully surprised.  This is absolutely delicious and something that I will make on a regular basis.  Thank you for sharing this superb recipe!

Absolutely Fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly with two small exceptions (listed below).  Since I did use vey large sweet potatoes I tripled the chili powder, ground cumin and oregano.  I also used 1 8-oz jar Ortega Mild Enchilada sauce and found it to be enough for our family.  The recipe made enough for 1-2 more meals.
Edited addition - I now make this recipe with the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe from this site but use 6 oz tomato paste i/o tomato sauce so it's not too runny.

My boyfriend declared, "This is my new favorite dinner you make" So I want you know thats HUGE stuff! I only made a couple of changes here... I used green sauce instead of red sauce, used only 4 sweet potatoes, since mine were HUGE, and left out the green onions cause (SAD FACE) my boyfriend hates onions (sigh)... I wish I had left them in there... Anyways, it was SO GOOD... We had some left over filling but spread it on tortillas and ate it the next day....AWESOME recipe!

This recipe is delicious!    Changes I made: * Added about 5 cooked/shredded chicken breasts, additional green onion and chopped cilantro. * Used a green enchilada sauce in place of the red sauce. * Tripled (or more) the seasonings * Used a hand-mixer to blend well before filling the tortillas

surprisingly delicious! i love sweet potatoes but the mixture of ingredients had me questioning it. it was amazing though! i used white sweet potatoes (didn't know it until i got home and started peeling the skin off and it wasn't orange, nevertheless, just as good) and also used fat free cream cheese to help cut down on the calories and fat. i also added a can of chicken, subbed sweet white onion for green and used green enchilada sauce instead of red. SOOOO good. the green sauce is a MUST! it complements the enchiladas so well. a little tip to cut down on the time is to peel and cube the sweet potatoes and boil them for fifteen minutes. cuts down about 20 minutes on cooking time.

I made these because of all the good reviews, but I wasn't sure I would like them. They are just as good as everyone keeps saying! I had 2 and a half baked sweet potatoes left over from Easter dinner, so that's how many I used. I added half a block of cream cheese and the full amount of spices. I didn't fry the tortillas, just heated them up in the microwave and put them in the enchilada sauce before filling up and rolling them. Added a bit more sauce and cheese on top. I used Chi-chi's Mild red Enchilada sauce and I thought it was tangy enough to compliment the filling. I'm already looking forward to having some tomorrow!

I really loved the filling in these.  In fact this recipe made so much extra filling that I was using it in everything for two to three days after I made the enchiladas.  The only complaint I had at all was that I think the enchilada sauce covered the taste of the filling a bit.  I may try green sauce next time and see how that turns out.  I also bumped up the spices quite a bit.   I made them for my family and they all enjoyed them.

These were delicious. I didn't fry or dip the tortillas--I just heated them in a moist paper towel in the microwave, then filled, rolled, and added the sauce. That's how I always make enchiladas and it works well without the extra fat from frying or the extra step of dipping them in sauce.

Ok, and a good way to use up some sweet potatoes, but not as good as the recipe for sweet potato black bean burritos on this site. Definitely use green enchilada sauce.

This was delicious, and I will definitely make it again.  The only reason I am giving this recipe  four stars is because of the changes I made to the recipe as written - some of which I think are necessary.  After reading through all of the reviews I made the following modifications:  I halved the number of sweet potatoes and cream cheese amount, but kept the chili power, cumin, and oregano measurements the same.  If you are going to use the full amount of sweet potatoes and cream cheese, you really need to up the spices.  Secondly, I cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes rather than boiling them for 30 minutes.  Thirdly, I used a tortilla warmer to heat up the tortillas in the microwave instead of frying.  Lastly, I added a small amount of black beans into each tortilla before rolling them up (i.e., I didn't mash the beans with the sweet potatoes).  Also, although I have made these with red sauce, I highly recommend trying with salsa verde (Goya brand is good).  I also like to sprinkle extra green onion pieces once on top once out of the oven.

This is now my favorite enchiladas I used slightly stale corn tortillas to give it a little crunchy texture and it soaked up nicely with the sauce. I also add jalapenos to the cream cheese mixture(I like a bit of heat) I also did half monterey jack and half cheddar cheese.  I made it twice so far and I will continue to make it thank you for the lovely recipe.

Excellent recipe, all three kids and my husband lapped it up!  When I bake sweet potatos I always do at least 6, then cool the extras and stick them in the fridge for these kinds of recipes.  I used 2 HUGE pre-baked potatos for this, all the rest of the ingredients in their full listed amounts and had exactly the right amount of filling for 12 corn tortillas.  I did do one substitution, instead of the can of enchilada sauce I used a full recipe of my homemade ranchero sauce, poured half in the bottom of the baking dish and the other half on top of the enchiladas.  FANTASTIC!

No need to use 5 potatoes unless you're cooking for a party. It made 30 enchiladas for me (maybe I made little ones, but still it makes a lot). I didn't use the oregano because I didn't have any. Also, I made a batch with red sauce and green sauce, and the green sauce tastes better IMO. My friends thought so too. Great dish though

These are so good but I must confess I'm a huge fan of savory sweet potato dishes. Don't be afraid to try this recipe if you're so-so on sweet potatoes.; chances are, you'll be impressed with the flavor and won't notice exactly what the ingredient is in them. I didn't alter ingredients, other than using green enchilada sauce, but did halve the recipe (made seven enchiladas). I plan on fixing this for my son when I have him over for dinner some evening- he said the recipe sounded good (and this from someone that is not fond of sweet potatoes). The enchiladas have a nice dense, flavorful texture- a little like your basic bean burrito- the cream cheese and spices really set this apart. Yum!

Such a rich and tasty dish! Instead of boiling the sweet potatoes I tossed them in olive oil and roasted them in the oven at 400 degrees for a half hour. I used half the cream cheese and added 1 can of black beans and a little bit of red onion instead of green onions, and used cinnamon instead of oregano. I also used mole instead of enchilada sauce. So I made a bunch of changes but the end result was amazing.

These were surprisingly good!  Im not a huge sweet potato fan, but had extra potatoes from Thanksgiving left over, so I decided to try something new.  Im glad I did!  This dish was so easy and tasted great!  I had to alter it a bit because of what I had in my fridge.  I used 1 oz. of cream cheese and a package of garlic and herb boursin cheese. Yum! I experimented with flour and corn tortillas, which were both good.  The corn tasted more authentic though.  The only cheese I had in the fridge was cheddar/american, and it tasted fine on top.  Overall, these enchiladas did not even taste like sweet potatoes!  They tasted authentic and very tasty!  It is definitely worth trying this recipe.

Delicious! (esp if you like sweet potatoes). But they are flavored more like refried beans, Mexican style by the time you get this done. Half the poatoes and cream cheese and don't skimp on the seasonings (maybe double them for real mexican flav or. I didn'ty add the onions, but it would've tasted great with green chiles and fresh cilantro on top. You could even add a little rice and chicken inside too.

So very tasty.  I added two diced zucchini and one sauteed yellow onion to the sweet potato mixture.  Also used half a block of neufchatel and mixed it into sweet potatoes with a hand mixer.  I used a can and a half of Hatch roasted green chili enchilada sauce and topped with sliced olives.  Very tasty.  Corn tortillas add a lot of great flavor so I recommend them over flour by far.  Also no need to fry tortillas before filling, microwave for a few seconds, then dip them in sauce to soften.  Makes one very heavy 9x13 dish, great for sharing or for giving to a neighbor.  Worth the effort!!

Absolutely delicious!  I had my doubts, but these are some of the best enchiladas I've ever had.  I used flour tortillas and added sliced olives and a lot more green onions.  This recipe will be in heavy rotation from now on.

Super!  I used 5 small sweet potatoes which I peeled, cut and steamed for 10 minutes.  I also used flavored flour tortillas because the particular corn tortillas I purchased were a bit small to properly roll up without the filling spilling out. I cut back the cream cheese to 4 oz.  Served this with a pepper mix cooked up in a cast iron skillet. Good weeknight vegetarian meal.

Just for any other BRITS using this recipie, 'green onions' means spring onions. Also the gas mark translates to around 4 but you need gas mark 7.

I followed the recipe exactly, well, double spices, as everyone had suggested. My husband Who eats everything ate it, but didn't ask me to save the leftovers (very uncommon).  The kids wouldn't even take more than one bite.   I didn't like it either.  . Will not make again.

Made this last night and just had to give it 5 Stars! I adjusted the spices since my husband loves a bit of heat.  Also added chopped fresh cilantro and used green enchilada sauce instead of the red. Corn and flour combination tortillas were perfect.

Delicious.  Made with 3 large potatoes and found the filling to be a little bland...doubled the seasonings and it was great.  It made 18 enchiladas for me.  My husband liked them too.

Excellent and easy to make as far as enchiladas go.  I think chipotle peppers would be a nice addition.

Pretty good.  I felt as if there was something missing, but couldn't put my finger on it.  My husband thought it was perfect.  I added corn and chilis.  I used flour tortillas (next times will try corn for sure and toast them like a previous reviewer suggested).   I will also add black beans. You do not need to use 5 sweet potatoes!  I wanted to half the recipe and used 3 large potatoes and it was way too much.  Ended up making the whole amount of the recipe.  Also, like a previous reviewer suggested, I peeled and cut the potatoes and then boiled them.  Did make it go quick. This will go in our rotation.

This is probably my second favorite on this site that I have made.  Followed exactly as the recipe stated and they were awesome.  Even my 9 and 14 year old children loved them.  The only thing I will say is  that if you have larger sweet potatoes you will get a lot more than what the recipe states. With 5 large sweet potatoes I made 2 13x9 pans of enchiladas which was enough for 2 meals for my family! Thanks for sharing!

Used sauteed sweet yellow onions in lieu of green onions.  Also used additional shredded cheese in each enchilada.  Fabulous vegetarian & gluten-free recipe!

This was a good recipe.  I didn't have tortillas so I just boiled whole wheat pasta and tossed into the mix.I poured entire thing into a casserole dish and baked at 350 with cheese on top. I turned out fine. This is a nice side dish the way I made it vs a main dish. It does make a great vegetarian side dish that is quite filling. very interesting texture.

I was really excited to make this recipe, but I was truly disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it just wasn't very tasty.  I'd like to give it a higher rating, but I actually threw out the leftovers, which is unheard of in my house.  I think the sweet potato mixture might be okay on its own, but with the enchilada sauce it just tasted funky.  I doubt I'll make these again.

This was ok. I fed four kids and two adults. Only one of the kids liked it. I though it was ok. My sister loved it. I omitted the cumin and didn't have green onions. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I wouldn't make it again.

I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to give this a shot. I must admit, I thought it was a bit strange to have sweet potatoes as a filling, but it tasted really good. My husband and I enjoyed this recipe, but next time I would add shredded leg or thigh chicken meat to give it more moisture and to add another texture.

This recipe is absolutely amazing!! I have eyed it for a while but was hesitant because it sounds so weird. However, it was definitely worth the try. I cut the recipe in half just incase I didn't like it and quickly wished I made more. I only made slight alterations such as using half cream cheese and half greek yogurt. I also completely eliminated frying the tortillas and just warmed them slightly in the microwave. And as recommended by others I did use green sauce. The smell was wonderful and the flavors blended well. I will be making this again for a Sunday dinner without telling my family what it is. I know they will love it too. Great find!!!

These were amazing. I used green enchilada sauce as others suggested and omitted the onions as I just wasn't feeling them. I couldn't stop eating the filling as I was making them. They tasted even better the next day.

I used green tomato chili sauce from Sanzone Farms and pepper jack cheese, this was so good, much better than I anticipated.  Thank you for the seasonal themed recipe.

These were absolutely DELICIOUS! I will most defintiely make them again. I, too, thought it sounded like a strange combo but I was intrigued so I forged ahead. I did a few things differently: one, I peeled and chopped my sweet potatoes and then roasted them in the oven at 425 for about 30 minutes. I'm just used to making my sweet potatoes this way so figured why not? I then mashed them with a sauteed sweet onion in place of the green onion. The other thing I did differently was I warmed my corn tortillas one at a time in a very hot frying pan, no oil, just ten or so seconds per side. It makes them nice and pliable without the added fat of the oil. These were truly outstanding and I'll be passing this recipe along to some other sweet potato-loving friends :)

Crazy easy, delicious recipe!  My picky kids loved it - didn't even realize they were eating sweet potatoes.  This is going to become a "regular" recipe in our household. Only changes I made were to make my own enchilada sauce and to use whole wheat flour tortillas so no frying.  Even easier and healthier.

Good recipe- shows that unconventional combinations can work if you are adventurous!  I think it would be great as is, so please don't think my modification are b/c I think the recipe needs changes!   I made some adjustments b/c I wasn't going to the store to buy just 2 ingredients!  I didn't have any cream cheese so I omitted that ingredient.  I would have used it if I had it!  If you have it (I didn't), a mexican style crumbly cheese would work good here too. Instead (again, I was working with what I had in stock), I added cooked ground pork (breakfast sausage seasoned) into the sweet potato filling. I know it sounds odd, but it works.  I made beans the other day and cooked down the remaining liquid which was flavored with bacon, cilantro, salt, onions, and serrano peppers.  I added a few tablespoons of the liquid into the filling to make it more of a savory flavor.  (my sweet potato was REALLY sweet).  Also, I used verde sauce instead b/c for some reason I had a can of it in the pantry and wanted to use it up.  I really recommend frying the tortillas.  This keeps the enchiladas from becoming mush.  The enchiladas just don't come out the same if you don't.  I know it's not low fat, but I would skimp on the cheese instead of skipping the frying to reduce fat content.  That's of course just my opinion!    For a less sweet enchilada I would recommend using pumpkin in place of the sweet potato and sprinkling pepitas on the top of the finished enchiladas.

Had this for dinner tonight and it was really good!  I used a little extra chili powder and salt and a small can of chopped chili peppers because I didn't have any green onions.  Also used flour tortillas and softened them in the microwave,  Yum!  I will make this again!

This was suprising and delish! I agree with other users on "this makes a lot of filling"!!! (and I used only 3 potatoes!) I filled 13 flour tortillas (larger than corn) This completely filled a 13x9x3 baking dish! We make all kinds of enchiladas-we don't fry-always dip our tortillas-corn or flour so I had to use 2-28 oz cans of enchilada sauce-we chose green and the tartness of the green is so great with the sweet of the potato filling! Next time we decided to add Salsa Verde chunky style to the enchilada filling for the crunchy texture. We used low fat (nuefatechel) cream cheese and there is no way you could tell. Used a mix of chedder and low fat mozz (it's what I had) We wanted some crunch and I didn't have the salsa verde this time but I had fresh green tomatoes from my garden so I added them if you are looking for things to do with those!! Yummy-Would be a great dish to make ahead and take to a potluck!

This was (and actually still) is pretty good. I was very hesitate to give it a try but it got to the point where I needed to use these sweet potatoes I had laying around and fast so I made this and I was presently surprised.

totally delish.  the spices definitely need to be doubled.  and i had so much filling left over that i made 4 extra and froze them (before baking, but after enchilada sauce and cheese).  this is a great, healthy vegetarian main course that will stay in our rotation.  thanks so much!!

These are phenomenal! I followed the recipe except to use fat-free cream cheese and used the suggestion of another reviewer to not fry the tortillas but toast them instead and then dip them in the enchilada sauce before filling and rolling them. Will make again!

These are great.  I omit the cumin (not a cumin fan at all), and I mix the white part of the green onion into the mixture and put the green part over the top for garnish.  If you're buying sweet potatoes at the store, weigh them out to 2.75 to 3 pounds.  One of those little 3 lb. bags of sweet potatoes from Aldi make me about 18 enchiladas, if I measure out the filling to exactly 1/3 cup each.    I like to keep these on the healthy side.  I don't fry the tortillas.  I brush the bottom of the pan or baking dish I put them in with a liberal amount of olive oil.  I scoop some mixture out of a big bowl with a 1/3 measuring cup and take a butter knife to level off the top.  I then scrape the cup onto the middle of a white corn tortilla.  I use the knife to make sure it's spread mostly down the middle.  I scrape a little of the mixture outward to the side about two inches, so when I fold it, some of the mixture acts as a "glue," holding it closed.  I don't put that folded side face down.  I think the tortilla holds the mixture better with the folded side upright and makes less mess.  Not all brands of corn tortillas break easily when you fold them.  I use the Mission brand.  I find that holds together nicely.  A wonderful meatless dish!  I like GREEN enchilada sauce better.  Has less of a bite, enhances and compliments the taste of the sweet potato more, IMO.  As a bonus it looks more pleasing.  Not just a big blob of red and orange.  Of course I put a big dollop of sour cream on t

A couple of modifications: This is my favorite recipe, but it's labor intensive, so to save some effort, I steam the sweet potatoes 1-3 days ahead and refrigerate them.  And instead of frying the tortillas, I brush them with oil and lay them on a baking sheet and bake 2-3 minutes on each side at 350 (this is also a lower-fat option).

Ok, so like many of you, I was skeptical. Sweet Potato enchiladas? that sounds gross! But at the recommendation of a friend, I tried them anyways and I am so glad that I did! These were wonderful!!!! The only thing that I did differently was that I served them with a homemade salsa verde enchilada sauce (I'm not a big fan of red). These paired great with Mexican rice. Even my picky boyfriend loved them! Thanks!! We will definitely be having these again!

This recipe takes a lot of time to make, but it is SO WORTH IT! We have made this a few times when we have company, and it has always been a hit. This recipe makes about three dishes at a time, but that's never a problem. The enchiladas re-heat wonderfully in our toaster oven.

Very tasty dish. I was skeptical of using sweet potato as a filler for enchiladas, but it came out pretty good. I did add extra spices and onions from which it called for. This recipe is a keeper because of the flavors and the use of the sweet potato.    The only thing I will definitely change for the next time is that I will leave the sweet potato mixture a bit chunky. I did not care for the "mushiness" of the pureed filling. Perhaps add corn kernels of black beans??  I also will most definitely use a homemade enchilada sauce. The canned stuff does not do this recipe justice.

This recipe was a hit!  We liked it as is but next time I will double up the spices and add cayenne pepper.  Great way to get veggies in and 2 of my 3 boys loved it (always one).   This is going to become a "repeater" which does not happen often.

Awesome stuff right here. I switched up a few things from the original like using yams instead of sweet potatoes because they have more nutritional value, tripling the spices, caramelizing a yellow onion instead of green with about 3 cloves of garlic before putting it into the mix. I just put the corn tortillas in the preheated oven for about 2 minutes to get them flexible enough to roll. I topped both kinds – I made red and green – with olives and bell peppers. I also added a chopped up jalapeno to the middle stuff. I think next time I'll add sausage if none of my veg friends are over.

10 stars!! YUM!! I had this dish at a vegetarian restaurant years ago, only they used pumpkin instead of potato. Anyway, I DOUBLED the chili, cumin and oregano and sauteed this mixture one minute in a bit of oil to bring out the flavor. We fried the tortillas, but next time I will try without. DEEEElish :)

I made this for my newly vegetarian mom for mothers day, it was great!  Two people liked them the way they were, two people thought that more spice was needed.  I used flour tortillas and didn't fry them used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and didn't miss those calories at all.  Very good, will make again as a vegetarian option!

I was skeptical about this recipe, but WOW is it good, and it's relatively inexpensive to make. I was disappointed by the leftovers, though - these got really mushy in the fridge overnight. I'll definitely be making these again.

This is delicious! I did double the spices and added a little chipotle hot sauce for extra, smoky kick.  I also like the filling so much that I will be making it as a side dish.

I made it without changing a thing, and that’s how I will continue to make it.  Everyone loved it. It’s a great combination of sweet and savory.  I guess I did change one thing, I baked the potatoes the day before to save time.  Great dish.  I served it with a corn,  black bean and tomato salsa with a lime/cumin sauce.  Went great with it

I could not believe how delicious these were! Even the "I don't like sweet potato, I need meat" men in my life love these enchiladas! I eliminate the oil and frying. I just wrap and add to the casserole dish and bake. I make them regularly and they are always a hit! I have also frozen left over and reheated a month later and they were just as good!

This was delicious.  I only used four sweet potatoes and had enough filling to make two pans of  enchiladas with left over filling.  I substituted one sweet onion because that was what I had on hand.  I will add chicken in the future, but wanted to try it without and I'm glad I did.   I'm always looking for a tasty vegetarian option.

I cut this recipe down since my kids are not sweet potato fans and I needed a vegetarian meal for myself. I have made mashed sweet potatoes with cream cheese and chili powder before so I didn't think this would be too bad. It wasn't but the sweet potato mix needs some tweaking. It could use some more chili powder and other seasonings.

These took some time to prepare, but in the end the prep was worth it! Easy prep though. These were amazingly delicious and I am definitely going to make them again. Everyone who tried them, loved them, even people that don't normally eat sweet potatoes! I might add some black beans to the mix next time for some extra protein. Make these if you get the chance! :)

Love this. I added 1 C corn salsa, 4Tbs sour cream and 2Tbs grated cheddar to the yams before filling the tortillas. Great texture and very savory and comforting flavor. Will do this again, esp in place of meat filled enchiladas.

I followed the recipe for the most part, except I didn't have green onions or cumin. I did add cinnamon to the potato mixture because cinnamon & sweet potatoes just seem to go together. A delicious vegetarian spin on enchiladas!

Delicious!
I only had 3 sweet potatoes and so I used half the cream cheese but I kept all the spices from the original recipe at the full amount. Make sure you do add the cumin!
A packaged enchilada sauce was great. I wouldn't use any other sauce.
Oh, and I always use wheat tortillas, I'm sure corn ones are great too; just a preference.

Good but a little too sweet . I probably would have preferred the filling with less cream cheese. Good but not awesone. My only alteration was i had flour totillas in place of corn ones available.

Wow, these were fantastic. I served them to my family and everyone gobbled them up despite the butternut squash (subbed for sweet potatoes since I had to it and no potatoes). My kids hate squash, but didn't know it was a main ingredient until I told them. Based on other reviews, I upped the spices to approx 1T for the chili powder, cumin, and oregano and added in some fresh chopped cilantro, 1 can black beans, and some leftover chicken. Wrapped in warm flour tortillas, covered in green enchilada sauce and cheese.  Even without my changes, these would be great, just be sure that the spice ratio is adequate for the amount of squash/potato added.

This was an amazing . A few adjustments also i used flour instead of corn and I added yellow onion (along with the green onions) . This maybe one of my favorites served with salsa and sour cream as if it was a typical enchilada. Oh yeah I baked the sweet potato for 30mins.

This was a great way to use sweet potato/kumara (in NZ).
I used finely chopped red onion & ricotta cheese. The 
enchiladas were a good consistency after being baked in
the oven. Had it with a green salad. Will make again, with
ricotta cheese not cream cheese, as it's too rich. 
Will be on my rotation list as absolutely yummy!

These were really good and I am  not a sweet potato person.  We spiced it to our taste and used less sweet potatoes.  It is now a regular at our household.  We also preferred the green sauce.  Yummm!

However, I prefer them with the following changes: I only use 2 large or 3 small sweet potatoes instead of 5 and I peel and cube them first to cut down on the boiling time,  I use 1/3 to 1/2 of a sweet yellow onion instead of green, I increase the spices to my liking, I heat the tortillas in the microwave instead of frying them, and I use the Four Cheese Mexican Blend instead of Monterey. With these changes, they are so good, even people who don't like sweet potatoes love them.

The only changes I made was to add a box of frozen spinach , also didn't fry the tortillas before assembly, just warmed them for a few seconds in a pan.  I topped them with avocado  after baking, tasted great served with black beans.  I agree that 5 sweet potatoes is too many, I used three!

I love this recipe! I was looking for something I could make ahead of time for school and freeze. This recipe fits the bill perfectly. The  only changes I made are omitting the onion, using  whole wheat tortillas, and not frying the tortilla shells.

I took previous reviewer's advice and I put extra spices in the filling. It turned out great! The only complaint I would have is that the filling needs a little more texture to it-maybe next time I won't mash the potatoes as much or put in more onion.
Also I didn't have green onions so I cut up 1/2 a white one and fried it up a little in a hot  pan with some butter.

Delicious. Reading other reviews first, I noticed many commenting that there was a lot of filling left over. I used 3 large sweet potatoes, peeled, which came to a total of 1.36 kg (3 lbs), and after mashing everything together, it made a total of 6 cups of filling. This was enough to fill 18 tortillas with the recommended 1/3-cup in each.  I used wheat tortillas and didn't bother frying them (it's not necessary, in my opinion), so they were easy to roll up. I used 3 cups of the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce recipe on this site, and put a thin layer of the sauce on the bottom of the 9" x 13" casserole dish to prevent the tortillas from sticking. I used shredded Tex-Mex cheese as the topping.  Would definitely make again.

Yum! I rate this 5 stars, with the following changes, thanks to the other reviewers:
1. 2 gigantic sweet potatoes was the perfect amount to fill 12 tortillas.
2. Double the chili powder, oregano, and salt.
3. Add 1 t coriander. Yum!
4. Don't fry the tortillas. IMO, no need. Just dipped in warm water, instead.
5. Use green chile sauce. I think it would be lovely with red chile sauce, too. I'll try it that way, next time. 

This ended up being a super simple recipe, and VERY flavorful.

Pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  The only changes I made were, I used 2 sweet potatoes, but kept the spices measurements per the recipe.  I also made my own enchilada sauce because I prefer my own homemade.   I was able to fill 10 tortillas.  These were perfect & delicious!

I've made this 6 or 7 times, and I think I've got it down now.  There's only two of us, so I halve the recipe, but keep the spice quantities the same.  To keep things really easy, I drain and mash two 15-oz. cans of yams with 4 oz. whipped Greek yogurt/cream cheese.  As suggested by others, I chop, saute and add one medium onion.  With the spices, I add less than 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon (not too much!) and a tablespoon of finely chopped fresh cilantro (love it!).  Fresh tortillas are soft enough that I don't have to fry or even heat them prior to rolling the enchiladas; that said, I do find flour tortillas less prone to cracking and splitting than the corn ones.  I usually get about 9 enchiladas, which fit snugly into a prepared 7x11" casserole dish.  Top with 10 oz. green enchilada sauce, 1/2 package of shredded cheese, and another tablespoon of chopped cilantro, bake as directed -- mmmmmm!  Very filling, and leftovers seldom live to see the next sunset.  What a great recipe!!!  
Edit: out of green enchilada sauce, I used a 10-oz. can of the red -- even better!  OMG, can I give another half-star?

I really liked this recipe! The filling for the enchiladas was so delicious. I did use a different sauce, which I got from allrecipes.com recipe for "Authentic Enchiladas Verdes" http://allrecipes.com/recipe/authentic-enchiladas-verdes/detail.aspx The green tomatillo sauce was the perfect compliment to this already yummy dish.

A great way to use up sweet potatoes! I used maybe 4 or 5 potatoes, I wasn't concerned about having too much filling- we love leftovers! I agree that there isn't a whole lot of flavor, so I recommend doubling the spices and then adding more to taste. Made 18 enchiladas for us.

What a great and easy recipe! I only cooked about a quarter of the recipe and I used reduced fat onion and chive cream cheese instead of regular and probably only used about 1/2 the amount called for. I also added some diced green chilis for spice, low fat Mozzarella and finally instead of corn tortillas I substituted whole wheat corn tortillas..... lower fat but just as delicious!

I used green enchilada sauce, since that is what I had in the pantry , and no cream cheese. I added in some red kidney beans, green chilies and topped with black olives and cilantro.

I think it would be better if you cubed the sweet potatoes rather than mashing, just to give it a little texture.  I'd like to try it with green enchilada sauce per other reviewers next time.  Overall it was a good and different way to prepare sweet potatoes!

Thought it sounded like an interesting recipe, but I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  It was great and I will definitely make it again.  We were snowed in, so I had to use what was in the house.  Substituted 1/2 onion (chopped) for the green onion, taco sauce for enchilada sauce and pita bread for tortillas.  By stuffing the pitas (which I had still crisped up in a saute pan first) with the potato stuffing, it added a nice bulk and made them very easy to handle.  Using McCormick Mexican Seasoning is a nice short cut for the seasoning too.  It was a delicious, if non-traditional, snowy night meal :-)

Excellent. I have kinda picky kids so I left out the onions; I didn't fry to tortillas as I didn't see a need. And it was delicious. (The enchilada sauce I got was a little spicy for the younger diners, but that was a tactical error on my part).  The only thing I'd note is that the number of sweet potatoes you need depends entirely on the size--I had only two, but they were both monsters and I had some filling left over.

This was amazing and will be added to the recipe rotation. I served it to my best friend the first night and my boyfriend the next night as leftovers, and both loved it. I made a few minor changes; I used whole wheat tortillas instead of corn and did not fry them. This saved a lot of time and I will definitely do the same next time I make this. Also, the enchilada sauce I bought was only 14 oz, so I made up the difference with 1/2 a 10 oz can of minced tomatoes with green chilies. I also added a skinned, seeded chopped tomato to the sauce and would have added more but I ran out of time. I liked the fresh tomato in the sauce and will add more next time; maybe 4-5, canned would be easier but would probably add too much liquid.

This is a good recipe idea.  Mine turned out tasty  but I think next time I may up the spices a bit,  especially the chili powder.

I am always looking for meatless recipes and this is a simply Great! A good find and real keeper. I brought them for lunch at work to share with a friend and she couldn't stop raving about them as well.

I also only used 3 large sweet potatos but kept the spices and cream cheese the same. I also added corn and black beans. I used the flour tortillas because that is all I had on hand and just warmed them in the microwave before filling. These are so good! My sixth grader had friends over and they all loved it!

So good! I was worried my husband wouldn't appreciate the flavors, but he ate it and went back for seconds! I used vegetable flavored reduced fat cream cheese and decided not to fry the tortillas and the dish was delicious even with healthier substitutions. Will definitely make again!

These were the first things more complicated than store bought macaroni I've ever cooked. They came out pretty well, despite crisping the tortillas too much, because the veggie oil was too hot. The next batch I just kept the oil on medium heat and it turned out soft and wrapped wonderfully. They are delicious.

This was really good.  I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them and doubled the spices.  I had a lot of mix left over...will probably use 4 sweet potatoes next time.  We topped it w/ sour cream and salsa after it was plated.  The combination of the ingredients sounds weird but it's really good.  This would make a good meal to take to a potluck.

These were awesome!  I did triple the spices as was recommended by some of the other reviewers.  I believe it would have been really blan had I not done that.  Otherwise, this recipe was perfect and I will definitely be making it again.  It did make a lot but the leftovers seemed to be even better!

Made these for my vegetarian brother & we all loved them.  I baked the sweet potatos (peelings on) in the microwave in just a few minutes to save a lot of time and aggravation over boiling for 30 min. as recipe directs.  Will definitely make again!

Very good flavor. Pleasing texture. Half the recipe is fine for two.

Really tasty meatless option!  Even my vegetable leery husband enjoyed it.  I was surprised that my toddler who devours most everything did not like it though...can't please everyone!  I did have to guess about the number of potatoes and would have preferred that info in weight.  But I just kept adding spices until it was no longer bland.  And I used green sauce because we aren't fans of red enchilada sauce.  But overall a great, creamy, easy recipe!

I used all low fat ingredients and warmed up the tortillas in the microwave (as another reviewer suggested) and they were a hit--even with my kids. I loved the creaminess of the sweet potato mixture.

Might be good to get the ammount of potato in weight. Sweets come in all sizes & I think it's why some people had sooo much or thought it bland.

When I told my husband what we were having for dinner he looked at me like I was crazy. He then proceeded to eat every bite and tried to go back for seconds but it was all gone. Great recipe and something different. Like others I doubled the spice and added a shredded chicken breast. I also substitued salsa for the enchilada sauce. Will definetly make this again.
