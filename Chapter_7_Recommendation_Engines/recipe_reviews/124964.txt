My new favorite buffet salad!  This was so easy, beautiful and delicious.  I had no scallions I used just a little chopped vidalia onion along with some chopped cucumber - enough to give it a "layer" without adding too much onion flavor, and I ended up omitting the bacon simply because I forgot to cook it.  I have no problem with bottled ranch dressing, however I used the Herbed Buttermilk Garlic and Parmesan Dressing from this site and it was amazing on this salad - perfect match for the four-cheese tortellini I used, and the fresh parmesan more than made up for the missing bacon.  Thanks for sharing this great salad recipe!  Will make this many, many times!

This salad is so filling it is a meal in itself.  I added 1/2 a rotisserie chicken, bacon bits and a few egg slices to the recipe.  I tossed the salad to spread the good stuff around -- yum.

Best salad I ever had! Wonderful for showers. For a baby shower, we added some raisins, grapes and maddarin orange slices. You wouldn't believe how nice they went with ranch dressing. In the fall it's nice to sprinkle whole fresh cranberries. For this salad, you can go wild with your imagination. Thank you for sharing. You gave a beautiful presentation.

This has become my all-time favorite salad to make when we have company. Each of the ingredients are essential and really enhance the others. I left off the bacon once and it just didn't have the same... ZING! I would recommend putting some ranch dressing on top of the spinach layer or it may become so packed that it is hard for it to get all the way to the bottom. Maybe that's just cause I"m using a smaller bowl, but it looks about the same as the pic on the recipe. It saves well in a resealable container in the fridge. Oh, don't forget to run cold water over your tortellini to cool it off first. Enjoy!!

Had this with the black bean and couscous salad and chili rubbed pork tenderloin with apricot ginger glaze.  Everyone thought they all went well together.  Loved them all!  I always look at the reviews and this one didn't need any changes except I had peppercorn ranch on hand and the tri-color tortellini.

This was a simple and beautiful salad. I used purple onion, added a little bit of shredded carrot to add even more color, and used a 16 oz. bottle of Ranch dressing instead of 8 oz.  I took this to a party and it was a great success.  Delicious!

I have made this 3 times now and each time, everyone loves it.  I make it exactly as stated in the recipe. Be sure to use a glass bowl so you can see the pretty, colorful layers and serve very cold.

This will be a new addition to summer salad collection. Just served to 12 family members for first and got great reviews.  Very tasty and easy.  Next time will possibly try real bacon bits from the jar to save time.  Used Ranch  dressing from the produce section.  A keeper.

My mom used to make this salad when I was a kid and I loved it!  It tastes great and is easy to make, what more could you as for.  This is ALWAYS a big hit when I make it for get togethers with family or friends.

I made this again for a special event - a bridal shower and again everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  In order to make serving a little easier - I like to layer the items on a very large platter - this way it's much easier for people to get a little of everything as the serve themselves.

While I hesitate to rate this since I didn't make it EXACTLY as directed, here goes anyway.  These are the changes I made: didn't have cabbage so just used teh spinach.  Added sliced cukes and sliced hard boiled eggs to it.  Used ranch dressing as well as an asiago peppercorn dressing.  It was awesome, but I can't believe these changes would alter the outcome..I think it would be just as good as the recipe is written.

Great! I left out the red cabbage and added a layer of chopped hard boiled egg. Great for a bbq or potluck!

The whole family loved it. We used it as a one-dish meal for dinner. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 the recommended dressing and it was plenty!  Also used regular tomatoes in place of cherry and that worked great too.  Very tasty and filling.

Served at our Easter dinner.  Delicious! I received many compliments on this salad.  I made this in a clear glass bowl and it looked so pretty on the table.

This was awesome!  I used only 4 slices bacon because I used turkey bacon (no extra fat to drain off, so you have more bacon).  As a timesaver, I used 1/2 of a 1-lb. bag of ready-to-eat- shredded cabbage, and 1/2 of a 1-lb. bag of ready-to-eat baby spinach.  For the tomatoes, I used 1/2 of a vine-ripe bag of cherry tomatoes (= 14 tomatoes), and light Ranch (scan 3/4 cup) to lower the fat.  It's key to let this sit overnight to 'hydrate' the vegetables; otherwise, the salad is kind of dry.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I'm glad to have a new layered salad instead of the standard seven layer all of the time.  This is as beautiful as it is tasty.  I found a raviolletti (tiny raviolis) that worked fantastically - I think a larger ravioli wouldn't have incorporated as nicely.  I did use a double recipe of the Herbed Buttermilk, Garlic and Parmesan Dressing instead of ranch and was very pleased.  I'll be bringing this to many parties, I'm sure!

Tasty salad.  However, I didn't use 6 cups of spinach as that seemed a bit excessive.  I followed the recipe, but I did add an entire package of crumbled bacon.  Next time around I would also add more tortellini.

Thought this was good, at least something a bit different to take to the pot luck.  I made the Herbed Buttermilk Garlic & Parm. Dressing as suggested.  I poured the dressing over top and let it sit over night.

Nice change of pace from 7 Layer Salad.  With the tortellini added it is a meal in itself.

This dish is beautiful to look at, and tastes great too. Used homemade ranch dressing from this site, which made it even better. Easy on the cook because it can be made ahead. Make sure to toss it well after everyone has had a chance to see how beautiful it is. Thanks!

Great recipe! I omitted the red cabbage layer and used less Ranch then listed. Took this to a family picnic and many people raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

This was beautiful! Great presentation...however it took a topple in the car on my way to the potluck, so - I experienced it as a tossed salad - not nearly the same look, but everyone said it tasted yummy - the tortellini is really good and not expected - next time I hope it stays upright!
