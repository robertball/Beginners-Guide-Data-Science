I doubled the bacon and used two ounces shredded swiss cheese only because I did not have sliced swiss cheese. Right before baking, I sprinkled the top with additional swiss cheese. I served this with homemade garlic pita chips/bagel chips. We inhaled the whole dish. Delicious!

Excellent!  I stirred in the chopped artichoke and chicken so the dip would be chunky and added 1 teaspoon of hot sauce.  I'll be making this again many times.

After reading all the ingredients I had high hopes for this recipe. I decided to use the dip as a filling for a baked lasagna dish, laying the noodles with the dip. It came out amazingly good. So glad I found this recipe.

Super tasty and easy to make! I threw all the ingredients in my food processor and spread it out into a pan to be baked the next day. It made prepping for my party so much easier and this dip was the first thing to go! People were dipping anything they could into it!

So good! My dip turned green since I also put the spinach in the food processor! Used low fat mayo. This was so tasty with all of the different ingredients...will most definately make again. My company inhaled this dip. Served with whole wheat Ritz crackers and Cracked Pepper and Olive Oil Triscuits.

Tastes great, but turned out an unappetizing minty green color. The directions don't indicate this, but should add the spinach post-blender to avoid this. Will do so next time

SOLID recipe. Like some of the other reviewers suggested, I'm going to stir in the chicken, bacon, and chopped artichoke next time to give it a little more texture. Also, just about every recipe can use more cheese. But it's got great flavor. Really good stuff.

I usually use the Hot Artichoke and Spinach Dip II recipe from this site and tweak it to my liking, and its gone before you know it every time. But I saw this and thought Hmmmm. chicken good, bacon GREAT ! after-all doesn't bacon make everything better? Anyway after its all said and done I found just a little to much going on with the taste of it, not bad I guess I'm just partial to the other, maybe if I hadn't had that first...just saying

Used cream cheese instead of Neufchatel and cheddar instead of swiss.  Added jalepeno peppers.....was fantastic!

I was surprised at how this turned out, and I kept thinking I must have made a mistake but I read the recipe over and over again and I got everything spot-on.  The only thing that MIGHT be different is that I used 1 whole, poached chicken breast.  (Well 1/2 of the bird's breast).  This dip turned out almost HEALTHY!  I used the lean Chicken Breast, Spinach, Artichoke Hearts, Hormel pre-cooked 50% lean Real Bacon Bits.  The 1/2 cup Mayo and 1/2 cup 2% Low Fat Mozzerella isn't that much considering the dip fills up an entire pie plate.  I also used lower fat Neufchatel and 2 slices of 2% Swiss Cheese.  I guess those are slightly different ingredients but of course up to the Cook.  Anyway, I posted a picture.  It came out light and fluffy, more like a Chicken Salad Spread than a gooey cheesey heart stopping dip that I was expecting.  I even added swiss cheese to the top just to get SOME gooeyness out of it, but it just baked on and browned.  Hmm!  I don't think it was fair for the Reviewer to give it 1 star because it looked unhealthy, it really isn't all that bad.  Tastes good too!

Awesome Dip!!!! Although we swapped the Neufch√¢tel cheese for regular cream cheese... We didn't have Neufchatel cheese.. We added extra Swiss cheese for more flavor.  And added dried crushed red pepper instead of cayenne pepper, (again, because we didn't have all the ingredients on hand) but still WOW!!! Will definitely make this again and again!

I have made this recipe now at least 5 times.  I'm going to be honest - I usually don't like Spinach-Artichoke dip (like in restaurants), but this dip is AWESOME!   I'm to the point where I don't even follow the suggested ingredient ratios any longer -- I just take each ingredient - use the amount I think will be good (or however much I have on hand) and mix it all up in a bowl - then bake it at 350 degrees until it is bubbley and yummy-looking.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did the others at work.  I followed other recommendations and did not blend at all, just hand mixed all of the ingredients, so it did not turn green.  I used 2 boneless chicken thighs and instead of real bacon, used real bacon bits.  Will definitely make again!

This was a hit at a recent party!  I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used about a 1/3 cup of shredded parmesan cheese. I blended all the ingredients together in a food processor and added the chicken and the spinach in last, with just a couple of pulses. I added extra parmesan cheese on top at the end of the baking time. I will definitely be making this again!

Oh boy did this recipe make a lot of people happy!! I chopped up chicken, bacon and artichokes and added to sauce for a chunkier dip. Very thick...definitely needed solid crackers that wouldn't break. Bagel chips were perfect, tostitos would be great too!! Definitely will make many more times

I made this dip for a birthday gathering, it was very well received and was asked for this recipe from two of my daugher in laws!  The only change I made was I used frozen spinach, (that was all I had) I thawed it out, and put it in a bowl with paper towels to take out all the excess water, I mixed it all together and I didn't mind the green color!  I used red pepper as this was all I had. Oh, I doubled the swiss cheese as we LOVE cheese! With these minor changes, it didn't change your receipe into something else, it was DELISH!!!! Thank you Rayna for a great dip!!!

I think this recipe would have been much better if I hadn't used the food processor.  It just didn't have the right blend of flavours/texture.  Hand-chopping the chicken, bacon and artichokes and cooking it in the cheese sauce might work.
