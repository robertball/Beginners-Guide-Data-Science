These are okay, but my mom used to make some amazing ones using watermelon jello mix in the dough.  It added a lot more flavour.

These cookies look wonderful... But they have no taste, and their texture is not my favourite kind. Next time, I'll make a shortbread cookie dough, tint it red, and so on, instead of baking these tasteless cookies. Didn't have decorator sugar, so I made a glaze by myself, omitting egg white, made out of 1 C confectionner's sugar, 2 T milk and 10 drops green food coloring.

Don't use the regular sized chocolate chips.  They're too big.  Use the mini chips.  This cookie is great for a summer BBQ.  Lots of Ooooos and Aaaaaahs.

Tasted just ok to me, but my kids really liked them. Very cute looking, but I was disappointed that I couldn't make the color come out right.

The recipe is average, but the idea is cute. I would make it again. I would rate it four  stars if the cookies were not so tasteless. I didn't get the orange juice almost at all, so I do not know what the orange juice was for because I couldn't taste the orange juice.

This is a very good recipe but if you don't like chocolate chips then you can use little black sprinkles. Other wise this recipe is great for parties or even a special snack.

I liked these; they were fun to make! They end up really crispy (like a watermelon?), which isn't my personal favorite cookie type. However, unlike other reviewers, I didn't find then tasteless--more like a light buttery flavor--but, since that was a general consensus among reviewers, and since I was bringing them to a party, I added cinnamon and nutmeg (not exactly "summery," but good all year round). People were pretty impressed with the cookies. Thanks for the great--and cute--recipe!
