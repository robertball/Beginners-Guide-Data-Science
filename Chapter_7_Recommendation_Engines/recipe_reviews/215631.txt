I love these combinations of flavors.  I too use red onion and usually include some diced sweet bell peppers and a little bit of dices fresh jalapenos.  This is a wonderful topping for baked or pan saute'd tallapia.  You can also add a bit of sweet chile sauce to move toward a more Asian taste, but the mango really stars in any variation you my like.

This recipe is a huge hit in my house.  I've served it with fish, pork, and just with tortilla chips.  It doesn't last long.  The only modification I make to it is that I use red onions and I swap out 1/2 the cilantro for mint.  The mint gives it a very unique taste.  If I could I'd give this 3 thumbs up!

Great! however i added just a tad bit more sugar to put it more to the sweeter side rather than sour/tangy. But overall fantastic

The mango I used was just the right amount of ripe. This was absolutely delicious! Served with tortilla chips. My new must-have for parties.

I used this recipe as a base. I changed a few things. I used splenda instead of sugar. I am not a hugh cilantro fan but I know it did need some so I used a tsp of dried cilantro. I chopped up a red and yellow pepper. This added great flavor as well as color. For some added heat I chopped 1/2 of a jalapeno pepped without the seeds. I added 1/4 cup of Ball Fiesta Salsa Mix and cooked the mixture for 2 minutes. I canned my salsa for gifts. YUMMY!!

I added black beans and fresh summer corn off the cob. I did not add sugar b/c my mangos were quite ripe and sweet on their own.

Not bad.  Tried it a second time with no tomatoes, added diced cucumber and diced jalapeno pepper, omitted sugar and vinegar, and it was perfect!  Third time added black beans - yum!  5 stars with modifications.

Very tasty...and healthy!  I made this with roasted chicken breasts (grilled would have been better, but it's really cold out tonight...thus, no grilling) sliced over a bed of Caribbean coconut rice.  Yummy.  The only thing I did differently was to omit the vinegar and use extra lime juice.  I will be making this again.

Excellent!! Im a picky eater but wanted something to freshen up the same old, same old dinner. I made some slight changes. I switched lime juice to lemon 'cause I have a tree, and added a apple instead of the 1/2 of mango. The mago was too hard to cut to just use half of the second one.  Instead of garlic and onion I used shalots. My husband is not a huge fan of fresh garlic. And sometimes  onion can be too strong. I also added mint. I brought it to 50 year anniversary party, and everyone loved it! I will be making this again!

Very yummy, I actually made the mix, cooked it in a skilled for a few minutes, just until the onions got a bit translucent. I then cooked some chicken breast on the skillet with some lime juice, salt, and pepper. Once the chicken was done I sliced it thin and placed it in a tortilla. I added some cooked rice in the middle, put the mango on top and made it into a wrap. Grilled it off a bit to get a nice crunch on the outside. And wow was that ever yummy!!

This is the first time I've made fresh salsa, and I think I prefer cooked. I threw it in a saucepan and cooked it down for about 15 minutes and liked it a lot better. I too added a green pepper and a jalapeno for a bit of heat. Also added two more teaspoons of sugar because I prefer tomatoey stuff on the sweet side. I will definitely keep this recipe but will make the same changes. Now I can be one of the people that drive everybody crazy!

I thought this was good or what I know as mango salsa. The key to these fruit salsas is using in season fruit and tomatoes. This would be great on some grilled fish. Today, we ate it with some thin tortilla chips. I followed the recipe exactly, but had to use white distilled vinegar and I cut the black pepper back some. I made 1/2 recipe, and I am glad it is only 8 calories a serving as 2 of us ate the entire bowl! Definitely not 20 servings unless serving as a condiment to fish or chicken.

Very good salsa! I did make some changes, such as I used yellow & orange tomatoes instead of Roma. As suggested by other users I added diced jalapeno to add a bit of bite to it. I think I may use habanero next time.

Yummy Yummy Yummy!  This was really good.  I did not use these with chips but I did use them as a topping for the grilled "Spicy Chicken" recipe found on this site.  I know that the salsa would be delicious with chips but it was amazing to taste the heat of the chicken with the cool sweetness of the salsa.

This was a really refreshing salsa. Even my husband liked it which was a nice surprise since he doesn't like raw onions or tomatoes. I didn't use vinegar because I didn't have any off hand but I added mint leaves and chilli powder to give it a little kick with the sweetness which was amazing! And instead of using Roma tomatoes I used yellow sunburst tomatoes. All in all very delicious

I didn't have fresh cilantro when I made this so I substituted 2 tbsp. of dried crushed cilantro. Also I don't know if there's a big difference between cider vinegar and apple cider vinegar but I only had apple cider vinegar and the salsa was awesome! Next time I'll dice the tomatoes and mango a little smaller, but other than that I don't think I'll change a thing.

This has been a real hit on every occasion that I've served it.  To spice it up a bit, I add 2 to 4 hot chili peppers.  Fantastic!

Exactly what I was craving! 
I just kicked up the heat a little with 1/4 tsp chipotle powder & 1/4 tsp hot paprika.

This is incredibly delicious. The flavor combinations and ratio of ingredients are perfect. I add two teaspoons of red pepper flakes as a personal preference because I like spicy salsa. Awesome recipe!

I made this mango salsa when I made Fish tacos. It was delicious. I have made it twice since and have recommended it to friends.

This was just the right combination of flavors.  It was a big hit with the family and got eaten fast!  All that chopping was definitely worth it.

I served this salsa over blackened grilled snapper and couldn't get enough!  I did make two slight changes: added 1 small can of pineapple tidbits and subbed black pepper for red pepper.  I can not WAIT to make this again with the fish!

I followed the recipe exact, except I used distilled white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar because that was all I had and it was still delicious.

Excellent! I made it exactly as written and served it with tortilla chips. Then I made it with an addition of a cup of fresh sweet corn. It was also excellent. Either way, it's a good accompaniment to salmon or white fish. Serve with a timbale of rice and garnish with a sprig of cilantro. Elegant and tasty... Mmmmm!

Love this. Thought mango and tomstoed would be weird. It is a little weird to me still. But my husband loves mangoes and vinegar so this is one of his new favorites. He eats it like a salad and I like it over fish! I alway use red onion and less cilantro than called for in the recipe.

This dish was absolutely delicious!  Sweet, spicy, salty, tangy, fresh all at once in a perfect blend.  I followed the recipe nearly exactly (I only used one clove of garlic) and plan on making this dish again and again.

Loved it. My first time making mango anything! I watched a YouTube video that shows how to separate mango from skin by using a glass.  Very helpful. My only change was using a red onion.  This  will definitely go into a regular rotation at my house. I used it on baked chicken breasts with blackened MOJO seasoning.

This is so good. The only thing I changed was not adding pepper. I made it for Asian lettuce wraps. You must let it sit for a little bit so that the flavors will merge. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Our whole family loves this recipe. Always a hit.  My husband specifically brings home mangoes for me to make it.  I also use red onion.  The more it sits, the better it is for sure!! Great on fish, pork, and chicken or for eating with chips.

This recipe is so delicious!! I've made it several times and it's always a hit.  I use sweet onions. The mix of savory, sweet, and spicy is like a fiesta for my taste buds!  My coworker brought in mangos from his mango tree and I made this for the office and served with tortilla chips.  They raved about it!!

DELICIOUS!!! It was the perfect topper to my Carnitas.  I followed the recipe, no substitutions. The key is "FRESH!" Stay away from dry cilantro and reconstituted lime juice; It's just not the same because the processing takes away their natural flavors.  
The kids loved it too.  They loved it so much they ate it like a side salad and I had to make more.  I will definitely be making this again and this will probably become a staple in my house.

Thanks for Sharing!

Delicious! The only thing is I don't feel it needs sugar, the mango is sweet on its own and keeps it healthier and still veryyyy tasty :-)

Yum-o! In the interest of full disclosure, I omitted 2 things: the cider vinegar (because I didn't have it on hand) and the garlic (because I was in too much of a hurry to mince garlic). But other than that, made it according to the recipe (didn't add anything), and it was wonderful! I'll be making a lot of this.

I just made this for fish tacos for tomorrow nights dinner. Added everything except the tomato (which defeats the purpose of tomato/mango). I tested just to see what it taste like... OH MY GOODNESS I HOPE U STILL HAVE SOME LEFT IN THE MORNING. It's delish!!!! I really can't wait!

This was great.  Just right for me.  Everything.  Only substitute I made was replacing Pico de Gallo's Brand - Pico Limon - seasoning instead of pepper and maybe just a tad more salt and lime juice.  I hope I don't eat it all tonight.  Would love to see how it tastes tomorrow.  Also used red onions.  Flavors so well balanced and salty, garlic-y tart

I see someone added corn.  I'd love to try that next time.  Green Giant White Shoepeg Steamcrisp canned corn.

I really didn't expect this to be 5 stars.  I expected it to be a good base and I would add lib.  Turns out, it rocks just the way it is.

I hate store-bought salsa, but I still want something to dip my chips in. Tried this and was hooked! I make this whenever I can!

Sensational! I recommend leaving out the sugar because it's sweet enough as is. Adding a bit of red chili pepper gives it a nice zing too. Absolutely delicious!
