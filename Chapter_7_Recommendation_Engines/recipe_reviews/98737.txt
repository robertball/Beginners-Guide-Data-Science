These are incredibly sweet, as was mentioned by other reviewers, so  I did cut back on the sugar.  I   briefly heated the the jelly in the microwave on a low setting just a little which made it more spreadable.  As I was putting the baking dish in the oven, I noticed that I'd forgotten the cashews, so I just sprinkled them on top of the butterscotch chips which worked fine.

This recipe calls for apple jelly, but I used apple butter, as it is a richer product with a spicy fall flavor.  I was craving butterscotch but wanted something different than just cookies with butterscotch chips.  This recipe is absolutely amazing and gooey.  Not for people afraid of very sweet treats!

These are amazing. I baked them with apricot spread since I couldn't find apple jelly. The only thing I might change is add a little less sugar next time, they are pretty intense, but super delicious!

These tasted okay, but for all the expensive ingredients they were nothing out of the ordinary.

Very good and very sweet. I ended up using a whole 12oz jar of apple jelly just because it was hard to spread out and I wanted it to be in every piece. Everyone who tried them enjoyed them- and they were very easy. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe because I had some apple jelly to use up.  I read the reviews and cut down the sugar.  Also, as my son was watching me sprinkle the butterscotch chips on the top he pointed out how sweet it was going to be.  I only used 1/3 the bag.  These were good.  I put the apple jelly in the microwave to make it more fluid and easy to spread.  They were sort of greasy so I wonder if I could cut back on butter next time.  They held up when I cut them into bars.  Any fruit jam/jelly would work with this, and I'm getting ideas.

YUMMY! My husband said this has the best of both worlds, gooey and apple-y! I took it to work and it was a big hit as well!

I don't know if I did something wrong but I did not care for this. I followed the recipe exactly. It was a sticky gooey mess.
