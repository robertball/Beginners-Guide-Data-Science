I had an amazing raspberry dressing at this ridiculously expensive restaurant a few months ago and was looking to recreate it on my own.  This one definitely wasn't it.  So, I experimented.  I added 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper.  AMAZING!  Has that wonderful balsamic flavor but a creamy raspberry flavor as well.

This dressing was ok. I thought that was very thick and it needs something to give more flavor.

I changed this recipe up quite a bit because I was in a hurry to get a dressing on the salad. It turned out great though and went fabulously with the blueberries and carmelized pecans in my salad. I used raspberry yogurt instead of plain yogurt + raspberries. Since it was already sweetened I left out the sugar. I used white vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar that was suggested and a bit of aged balsamic. I know it sounds strange, but it was delicious! Mixed it up with a spoon, not the blender.

It was a hit at girls night out.  Paired it with a green salad containing red grapes, slivered almonds and chopped apples.  I used Greek yogert, raspberry jam, fresh raspberries, raspberry vinegar and splenda.  It was thick, but it coated the salad "just right"  I'll make it again.

This is very good, although a bit thick. I used 1/2 C frozen raspberries and raw sugar. Yummy on salad greens, dried cranberries and feta cheese.

Love this recipe - did not have plain yougurt but I used the yougurt drink (raspberry), added two tablespoons of olive oil and actually had raspberry red wine vinegar.....it's really good on the sesonal berry salad.
