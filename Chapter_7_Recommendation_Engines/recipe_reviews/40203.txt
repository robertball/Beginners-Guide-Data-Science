I give this 4 out of 5 because it is a good recipe true to form, but there are some techniques that could help make sure the beans turn out the way you want them to - that is, nice and creamy beans in a relatively thick cooking liquid. So here's the trick: brine your beans overnight in plenty of water and 2-3 tablespoons of salt. You may worry they'll be salty. They will be. But you'll dump a lot of that salty water off. Because you've done this, don't add any salt to the recipe until the end to suit your tastes. Since you've now brined them, add them to the pot with water to cover, add your other ingredients (I soften my onion and garlic in a little oil over medium heat first), and bring to a boil. Reduce to a VIGOROUS simmer for 45-60 minutes. Stir occasionally. That simmer will give you the thick cooking liquid. After that, you can add more seasonings or ham if you like, and continue to simmer until your beans are all nice and soft - maybe up to 30 minutes or so. Another note, I love to use up a left over ham bone if there's one lying around, and add a bay leaf or 2 to the mix. If you have bean issues (your beans are always crumbly and not creamy), then definitely give these tips a whirl and see if it doesn't help!

I'm the original submitter for this recipe and I'd just like to give a quick side note...  The liquid should be 4 cups water, 4 cups chicken or veggie broth, the salt should not be added til towards the end of cooking. Why Allrecipes editors changed this, is beyond me!

scrumptious recipe Sarah!  I soaked my beans (pinto) overnight. I read somewhere that you should add the salt at the last hour of simmering because salt can make beans tough. I did that, and cooked the recipe for 6.5 hrs.  my family loved them.

Thinking what to do with the ham bone from our Easter dinner and decided to make the family's favorite stand by; Ham and Beans!!!  Wonderful, easy, versatile recipe!  Only two things I did differently was to soak the beans the night before (which cuts down on the cooking time) and then cooked them in chicken broth vs water.   BEAN 101:  DO NOT add salt until the beans are cooked; adding salt during the soaking process or while cooking make the beans hard.  Wait to the end and season to taste.  Excellent recipe!

Thanks for this recipe. I am a native Texan and with only slight adjustments can now make beans like they should be. I like the six hour cooking best too.

I've been making brown/soup beans as my mother and grandmother always have, not adding any spices, just what they refer to as "fatback." I used the "fatback" for this recipe as well, but used the listed spices, and I LOVED it! I will never fix beans the same way again! We always serve it with cornbread, fried potatoes, and pickle lily or homemade sourkraut.

My hubby raved about this one, he's a big "southern cookin'" fan.  :) 

One thing to note, MAKE SURE you don't keep the pot covered when it is simmering for the 3 hours.  I checked on mine about halfway though, and all the liquid had dried up, and the beans were scorching on the bottom of the pot.  Thankfully I caught it in time, before anything was burnt too badly, added water, more chili powder and salt and pepper to the mix, and it came out fine in the end.  I didn't even notice any extra "smoke" in the taste. ;)

I've been looking for a good ol' fashion pinto bean recipe and this one can't be beat.  I had to work, so I had my son add the ingredients to a slow cooker (2 hrs on high, then simmer on low for about 4 or 5 hours).  This cut down on the worry about managing a simmering stock pot all day, as he is sometimes not the most attentive cook when there are all those video games to  play.  I also decided to use 2 ham hocks -- how can you deny all of that "hammy" goodness.  The end result was absolutely wonderful!  My son was so inflated with pride, he was strutting around the kitchen like the Iron Chef, planning his next cooking adventure -- I just hope it involves a slow cooker too.

Just finished having this for dinner and zomg....these southern beans are what I remember from childhood. 
Modifications: 1) Soaked the beans in water overnight, for about 10 hours; 2) Replaced 2 c of the water with 2 cans chicken broth; 3) added 4 cloves garlic instead of 2.  ADDITIONS: 1) One half large carrot, diced (instead of adding sugar, a small amount is imparted via the carrots); 2) one half rib celery, diced.  
All placed in crock pot on low for 6 hours, left to cool in pot for 1 hour; season to taste with additional chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper.  Serve with diced onions.

This was so good!! Even my teenage son loved it (I know he really liked it when he finished the leftovers the next day.) I made a couple of changes based on some ot the reviews.  I added twice as much chili powder to it and I also put in about 1/2t of red pepper flakes.  This added a little kick but did not make it too spicy.  I also put in 2t of onion powder to kick up the onion flavor a bit.  With that many beans the spices can quickly get "sucked up".  I followed the suggestion of cooking it for 6 hours on the stove with a cover. I am glad I did.  After about 5 hours.  I took out the ham hocks and threw them away (I don't like the fatty meat on them).  I then added about 1 1/2 cups of leaner chopped ham. This was great and I will make it again.

I've made this twice - and the second time they were much better and the only thing I did was used a bigger stock pot and started with 10 cups of water.  I'll make a again when I have a hankering for beans!

These were the best pinto beans we've ever had.  I only made a few minor changes.  First, because of the problems with gas that beans can cause, I added the beans only to the water, brought to boil and let sit for 1 hr, then drained them.  I didn't have any ham hocks, but did have some ham in the freezer and used about 1 lb of that.  I sauteed the ham, onion, and garlic slightly before adding the beans AND, instead of all water, used 1/2 water and 1/2 low sodium chicken stock.  My husband loved them.  This is the only way I'll be fixing pinto beans from now on.

I made these beans yesterday to eat today but I found myself eating them late last night because I just had to have some. I grew up eating basic white beans cooked with ham hocks but my late mother in law always made "brown" beans with fried taters and cornbread. This recipe was great except I did do the quick soak with just water and drained and rinsed afterward then proceded with the recipe. I was skeptical about the chili powder I didn't want them to taste like chili but after hours of a low simmer it was perfect. I used some country ham pieces packaged just for seasoning. I am sure for those looking for a recipe to take them back to the past where a pot of beans was simmering and time was spent with someone you loved. This will do the trick. Remember seasoning is a matter of taste so don't low rate a recipe cause you up the seasoning. A true cook never measures unless baking anyway.

Loved it! Even my picky kids ate them.  These beans tasted just like Sunday dinner at dad's house.  I used the 6 hour cooking time and didn't change a thing.

This was SO good!  I threw all the ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook all day.  I only used 6 cups of water.  It was perfect!  I served it over fried potatoes, with cornbread muffins.  Yummy!

Yummmmmmmmy!  I took everyone's advice and let it cook for six hours.  I did end up having to add more water (difference between electric range and gas maybe) but it was wonderful.  I added some worchestershire sauce and a little garlic powder.  My husband LOVED it....and he's not a big fan of pinto beans!

This was pretty tasty - and the first time I'd ever bought and cooked a ham hock. I had to do a little research; I didn't know whether to get a smoked one or not, but I finally settled on a pretty large "hickory smoked pork hock". Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as written, ingredient-wise. I took the hock out at 4 hours, let it cool for 30 minutes, then stripped it and put the meat and a good amount of the pork fat back into the pot for another 30 minutes. It's a good thing I read elsewhere to peel off and discard the skin from the hock; I wouldn't have known any better otherwise. The dish tasted better when reheated over the next couple of days, since it thickened up more. I had thought the liquid would cook away over 4 hours or so, so I had the heat on low most of the time, but I guess that medium-low (as written) would have been fine after all. I have another hock in the fridge, so I'll be making this again in a week or two. A nice little adventure!

If you're a Southerner, you've probably had these many times.  Transplanted to Wisconsin from my native Deep South, this is one of the dishes I make when I need a Southern comfort food fix.  Although I don't use a recipe and never have (Southern grandmothers always taught their daughthers and granddaughters how to make a pot of beans!), this recipe minus the chili powder and with a few flakes of crushed red pepper is how I've always made them.  Easy and ecomonical, this is good stuff!  Cornbread and sweet pickles are a must for me!  And it's good with all kinds of beans, although pinto are tops.  If you like basic and filling dishes, give it a try.

This is the best way to cook pintos. Tasty, wonderful and the broth is to die for. Cornbread or biscuits alongside to get that wonderful juice.

Well, I never would have thought of adding chili powder to southern pintos! While this isn't how my hubby's parents make it, we all liked it, and six hours is the best cooking time. Leftovers make awesome REFRIED BEANS!!!! Remove a little liquid if necessary, add some onion and garlic powder, extra chili powder too, and serve up Mexican! Mmmmm!

This tastes just like how my mother-in-law makes her beans and ham. My husband grew up on it. We always serve this with cornbread. You have to have thinly sliced raw onion to sprinkle on and eat with it. She also served fried potatoes when she made this.

Oh my gosh, the smell is so yummy!  I really  loved the flavor. I used chicken broth instead of water.  I couldn't believe the person that said it lacked flavor.  I've never used ham hocks before. I believe that is what makes this so flavorful.  I waited to the end to add salt, but I don't think it needs it.  I believe the ham hocks provided plenty of flavor, along with the other ingredients.  This is now my favorite bean recipe.

Everyone loved them!  I did use chicken broth instead of water omitted the salt and pepper. Added extra garlic and used onion powder instead of real onions.  I also added extra onion powder and one bay leaf.  I also used two ham hocks.  I cooked my beans in the crock pot on low overnight for dinner the next day.  They turned out awesome!

Two thumbs up from everyone in the house.  I made this using a meaty ham bone from Christmas and simmered for 4.5 hours (got a late start) but it still made a nice New Years' Day meal with sweet cornbread on the side.

These are awesome, and they make the house smell awesome too! Very hearty and flavorful. I was skeptical about the chili powder but threw it in anyway and I'm glad I did. I didn't have an onion on hand so I subbed 3T dried minced onion, but otherwise I follow the ingredient list exactly. As others have done, I soaked the beans in plain water overnight, then discarded the water and started fresh when I began cooking. I cooked for about 3 hours and it was plenty tasty and thick at that point. I was wondering whether to cover the pot but decided not to - and I think that's key to getting them to thicken up.

My favorite pinto bean recipe so far.  I cooked this recipe with the modifications suggested on Dec 09, 2010 regarding the overnight soak and everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly except for that step.  I served it with cheese/jalapeno cornbread.

This was wonderful & warmed the soul on a cold night. I used northern beans instead of pinto. I made this in my slow cooker on low for 8 hours. I also added diced ham steak and removed the ham hock upon serving. I served with buttermilk corn muffins.

Yummy!  I soaked the beans overnight, then just threw everything in a pot and simmered on the stove all day.  I used a large meaty ham bone leftover and frozen since Christmas.

I cooked these in the crockpot, so easy I don't know why I've been so afraid to make beans. This recipe is the way my grandma made them as soon as I took the first bite I was transported back 26 years to her kitchen. Thank you for the recipe I will make this again for sure whenever I need the comforts of home:-)

My mother made this recipe almost exactly to the letter since I was a little girl. I make it at least once a year with the left over ham bone. It’s the best, my comfort food. I’m in my seventies so I guess this is a classic!

YUM.  The only ham & bean soup I've ever had was made with dried navy beans.  That's what I *was* planning on making until I realized my pantry only had a bag of Pinto beans.  Am I ever glad.  This was delicious!!  Took the advice of another reviewer and 'brined' the beans overnight.  Drained that water off and then followed the recipe as written (with suggested 6 hour cook time).  Delicious.  Perfect for a supper on a night the temperature is already at 10 degrees F!

WOW!  Great recipe...Watch your pot on this one.  You are going to want to taste it as soon as it is done.  I didn't have any onions so I used a table spoon of onion powder.  I also used 9 cups of water and a couple of chicken bullion cubes.  By the way...1 lb of beans= 2 cups.  I can't wait for the family to try this one.

OMGosh I've been making beans for years but these are by far the best beans ever. I followed some other reviewers comments and added bay leaves. Also I presoaked them in chicken broth and all seasonings with salt pork and then I did NOT drain. Plugged in the crockpot on low for 12 hours. AMAZING!

excellent recipe!!! I have made this many times and it's always  good. I don't cook mine on the stovetop, I use my crockpot. I usually cook them on low for 8 or more hours. I also moosh some of the beans to make a thicker sauce, after about 7 hours of cooking. I never liked ham and beans till I made this recipe. I did soak the beans overnight and used northern beans, because i don't like pinto beans.

This a great recipe however I did make a few changes. I used 4 cups water and 4 cups chicken broth. I also used a leftover ham bone. I didnt use chili powder. I also used half pinto and half great northern beans. This was by far the best pot of beans I have made in years. SErved with corn bread. AMAZING!!!

3 stars because this requires a lot more spices than the recipe calls for. As written it is pretty bland. After almost doubling all the spices, the end results were pretty good.

This was so good!!! I started with 11 cups water, and I did add onion powder and extra garlic. My ham hocks didn't have much meat, so I added cubed ham. I would never have thought to add chili powder to soup beans but my husband loved it!!!  Thanks for a great recipe. Definitely a keeper!

These were pretty good and easy.  I added to the spices cumin, coriander, red pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and garlic salt, and a pinch of nutmeg.  It still could have used some more heat but with a 3,4, and 8 yr old I was limited.  But I did make jalapeno corn bread so that was some more heat for it.

Loved this! I always make ham and beans with great northern beans, but I had a ham bone to use and only pinto beans on hand. When I saw this called for chili powder, I wasn’t sure about it because I did not want chili, but this is nothing like chili. I’m glad I went with it because this was the best ham and beans I ever had! I think this will be my go to recipe from now on.

Very down-home and tasty. What I changed: I soaked my beans overnight. I put all ingredients; beans, onion & garlic, ham hock, water & chicken broth, plus seasonings,  into my Instant Pot electric pressure cooker. Set it on high pressure for 40 minutes. Let pressure come down naturally for about 10-15 minutes, then opened. So delicious! Came out perfectly. Will make again for my family.

The thing I didn't like about the recipe is that the liquid burned out after 4.5 hours. It was also kind of bland I thought.

Definitely a keeper!  Made these for my husband and I (he does not like beans at ALL), and he raved about them for a week afterward! Very similar to my own mother's recipe, we make this recipe at least twice a month at home.  Soak them overnight for the best texture, you won't be disappointed!

Great beans.  I've been cooking like this for a while now, using this recipe.  The only thing I change is I find 6 hours makes them overcooked.  I like to cook mine for just the 3 hours.

Excellent Recipe!  This took me straight back to my childhood - beans, ham, fried potatoes and cornbread!  There is NOTHING better!

These were some of the best beans ever. The second time I made them I substituted chicken broth for the water and a little extra chili powder and about 4 -5 small garlic cloves, and extra onion. about the last 2 hours of simmering  I added a large ham steak cut into chunks. They were FANTASTIC!!!

What a fantastic recipe! Instead of water, I cooked the beans in low salt chicken broth and added no additional salt as the ham hock has plenty on it's own.  As always, garlic and onion powders were added along with plenty of black pepper. My sauce turned out thick and creamy and full of flavor and I can't wait to dig into this delicious bowl full of fiber tonight! Thank you Sabryston!

Absolutely love this recipe. I make it with 2 ham steaks instead of a hock. The longer it cooks the better, and if you have leftovers it just gets tastier the next day. Wonderful with fresh bread.

I must have done something wrong.  Soaked beans overnight and then cooked in slowcooker on low for 8 hours as some had said.  Beans aren't done at all, will cook longer.

My family loves this!  Four stars rather than five only because I'm not a fan of pinto bean soups.  I'll make this again, not a thing needs tweaking.

Great pot of ham and beans. Not quite my mom's, but close. I'd add a little more garlic next time. Everyone here liked these.

This is very close to the old recipe my mother and grandmother used to make. Instead of chili powder, I used a 1/4 teaspoon each: paprika, cyan, coriander and cumin. I also used a 1/4lb of side meat cut into 2 inch cubes. Cook it as long as you can. Then spoon over fresh rice. *sigh* That's comfort food!

I make this without the ham in it for a vegetarian version. Add a bay leaf to mine also. Serve it with cornbread, fried tators and coleslaw.

Thanks! This is just how my family made it while I was growing up. This was my first time making it on my own, the only thing I did different was I used bacon ends and pieces, and it was SOOO YUMMY!

Instead of fresh onion I added a 1/4 cup of dried minced onion since I am so allergic to fresh onions.  Tasted great!

YUMMY!  Can I give this 10 stars?  I used this base recipe and made it in 1 hour in my pressure cooker.  I started by thoroughly rinsing the pinto beans then adding it to the cooker with 10 cups of water (broth not needed, salt slows the cooking of beans + extra salt flavor not needed in final product) and the ham bone, then cooked on high pressure for 8 min.  I allowed 15 min of natural release, then opened the valve to quick release the remaining steam. Meanwhile I prepared the remaining ingredients including 2-3 chopped celery stalks and cooked them in 1 Tbsp EVOO to blend flavors.  After adding all the remaining ingredients ( including 2 bay leaves-yum) to the beans and water, I pressure cooked them on high for 20 min.  I allowed a natural release (about 15-20min) before opening.  The beans were perfectly cooked!  I prefer my soup a little thicker so I removed the ham bone, strained out about 2 cups of beans, then used my immersion blender to roughly chop the remaining beans and veggies.  After replacing the 2c beans, it was the perfect consistency.  I served it over homesteader cornbread (WOW) from this site.

this is an amazing recipe! but for all of you out there who want to make it, do NOT add salt till the VERY END. wait until your beans have SOFTENED before putting salt in your beans. If you neglect this info, it will result in your beans staying hard and tough! they will not cook right.

I've made this a few times. I don't add any salt and I add a teaspoon of baking soda to soften the beans. I usually make a double batch. The first meal is bean and ham soup. Then I divide what's left in half. One half I leave as is. The other half I add a little brown sugar and sometimes molasses. Sometimes I use pure maple syrup instead. My kids love this recipe, too.

Great flavor, will definitely make again! Made a few changes to soaking time to remove as much oligosaccharides - indigestible sugars which cause flatulence - as possible from the beans. 
Step 1: Soak 1 lb pinto beans in 8 cups water overnight in covered pot, soak time 17 hours - NO SALT added 
Step 2: Rinse beans and pot very well with cold water; add beans and 8 cups water back to pot, bring to boil then promptly remove from heat. Let sit undisturbed for 3 1/2 hours in covered pot - NO SALT added. 
Step 3: Rinse beans and pot very well. 
Step 4: Back to pot, add beans, onion, garlic, 2 tsp chili powder, black pepper, 2 meaty ham hocks plus one ham steak cut into 1 inch pieces (ham steak adds salt to dish), cover with 4 cups of water & 4 cups no sodium chicken stock - NO SALT added. 
Step 5: Simmer in covered pot on med-low for 3 hours. - NO SALT added.
Step 6: Mix 1/4 cup flour with 3/4 cup water until smooth. Stir slowly into bean soup mixture. Simmer an additional 45 minutes. - NO SALT added.
Step 7: Dish into bowl, top with diced red onion and salt individually according to taste. Served with corn bread.

Made this because my mother (who doesn't cook anymore) had been requesting beans.  I dreaded making them because I remember bland tasteless mush from my childhood.  These were a good surprise, and even my Mom liked them.

Quick and easy, substituted habanero chile powder for the chili powder (should have cut the amount in half) so it was pretty spicy. Served with Beer Bread and boiled cabbage. Yummy!

I made this for the first time after Thanksgiving and it was great.  The only thing I did differently was put it in a crock pot for six hours instead of on the stove.  I put it on low for the first two hours, then high for two hours, and then low again for the last two hours.  This soup was phenomenal.  Thank you for sharing it!

I made this a few days ago. Very satisfying and so delicious! The only thing I added was extra beans and Emeril`s essence (his own blend of spices which is available at most grocery stores) and I believe it made the flavor better. So, I will definately be making this again and again.

Very good recipe!  The first time I made I used too much garlic and ruined it.  The 2nd time I backed off on the garlic and added 2 cans of tomato paste to thicken the liquid and give it some sweetness.  I also used the crockpot instead and cooked it on low for 12 hours.  Soooo good!!!

Thank you for your recipe.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect southern pintos to accompany fried catfish.  These are also good to use leftovers to mash for refried beans for burritos.  I didn't have a hamhock so I used a half pound of Petit Jean ham cooked in thru the whole process.

I soaked the beans overnight, and then combined all ingredients in a crockpot on high for 5 hours using only 6 cups of water.  Due to previous comments complaining of blandness, I used 2 ham hocks and added 1 bay leaf, 1/2 tsp. dried oregano, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, and doubled the garlic.  I think topping each serving with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese would be nice.

I vaguely followed the directions because I soaked the beans in plain water. Rinse the beans after soaking to reduce gas.  I added fresh water to cook with, a teaspoon of baking soda and everything else listed except I had a ham bone from a spiral cut ham that was left over. I put the onion in whole because I just wanted the flavor and removed it later. the rest of the directions are perfect. Also add some red pepper flakes too.  Serve with cornbread and fried potatoes and diced onions on top the beans.  Superb!!

This was so yummy!  We've had it three times now, and the first time was definitely the best because I simmered it for 8 hours.  It's still good if you only have 3 hours, but not anything spectacular.  You should really only make it if you'll be able to let it simmer all day.  Serve with fried cabbage and cornbread - a first-rate Southern meal!

Love this recipe. Followed it to the letter except I used the alternative of chopped ham instead of a ham hock, and I added a bit of ham boullion to make up for it. YUUUMMMY! Also did the 6 hours. Flavorful and inexpensive.

Edible, but definitely nothing extraordinary.  I was expecting more given all the good reviews.  Bland and we prefer our other bean recipe - thanks, but probably won't make again.

This is awesome! I was born and raised in the North, so when my Kentucky-bred husband asked for 'Brown beans and Ham' I really didn't know what he wanted. I found this recipe, and he LOVES it. I even like it, and I'm not a big bean fan as a rule. The only change I made was adding a couple extra cups of water (I have a gas stove)and adding more onion powder and garlic, because we like things with lots of flavor. This is just great! I'll be serving this when my family comes to visit from New York!

I used a bean mixture instead of just the pinto beans. IT turned out really good! I added several kinds of different spices to add more flavor.

First time making it,however I've enjoyed both my grandma's and aunt's recipes. I added a bit too much water to my beans when cooking, so my end result wasn't the texture I preferred. I asked my aunt what I could do to get it how I liked, and her simple fix was to spoon the desired amount of juices out,  after it cooled a bit, while the juices settled and the water somewhat separated to the top, so that when I spoon out extra juice,  I'd be able to leave behind the flavorful juices while getting rid of the watery. Lesson learned.  Other than adding too much water to mine, it turned out very tasty! I made a side of white rice and topped it with the beans and the gravy-like juices & it was fabulous, just like grandma's!

I only gave it four stars because I did make some substitutions.
Soaked the beans overnight, no salt added.  Added a can of Original Rotel,  a tablespoon of red pepper flakes and 2 jalapenos, with the seeds.  We like spicey.  Otherwise followed the recipe.

Started making these a couple of years ago instead of  my usual recipe with navy beans, and my family loves them! I add more ham and sometimes a small can of green chilies for extra flavor if I have them in the pantry.  Easy and really delicious, thanks for the recipe!

Ingredients are perfect! I served this twice to groups of hungry cowboys and they loved it.  I had to use a different ham source as it was what I had on hand, chopped up spiral spiced ham. I also increased the cooking time as advised on a different site; an overnight cook on high to keep it at a boil. Eight to 12 hours.
Yee Haw!

This is my go to recipe for ham and beans, my family loves it! The beans Always turn  out creamy, sometimes i mash a few with the bean masher. One time I did what I usually do and cooked my pinto beans seperately because I like to cook a bunch at once, while I am cooking down a leftover fryer chicken for broth.  I usually freeze half when they are done. The Organic pintos which I had purchased at the local natural grocery were old and after 4 or 5 hours of cooking I gave up on them, when beans are to old, they will never soften, as long as my beans aren't a year or two expired,  my recipe Always turns out fabulous!

I love this recipe exactly as written. If I am pressed for time (AND if my hambone is on the smaller side) this converts pretty well to the Instant Pot too. In the pressure cooker, I use 5 cups of water, the same ingredients, and cook on high for 60 minutes, or until the beans are soft. Remove bone, add the meat back to the pot  and simmer until desired thickness.

For those who like these spices, I'm sure  the beans are excellent.  It is a matter of taste, not a criticism of the recipe.  I married a Kentucky boy 58 years ago and had to learn to make beans the KY way with salt pork, slow simmer most of the day, then cornbread, sliced onion and fried potatoes.  Also learned to make "real cornbread" with stone-ground, self-rising meal.  The first time I made cornbread for him (the kind we had in Illinois) he said, "Not bad for cake".  So, I learned a lot and love the pinto beans, but again, it is a matter of taste and the comforting memories associated with the taste.

I made this on a cold football Sunday and it was a hit. I omitted the chili powder and just made it a good ole pot of beans. I made honey corn muffins to accompany the  beans. It was an awesome meal.

Cooking another pot of beans used brown beans 1st batch using navy beans this pot since the ham hocks came 2 to package. Never used ham hocks till now, but like the flavor they give the beans. I did not change a thing. I always try the recipe with out changes first time. thanks was delicious.

Great southern twist to ham and beans. I served it with fried cabbage and fried potatoes. Will not be a regular on my menu with these sides. I can feel the arteries clogging now.

I made this recipe last night (it was snowing and cold).  What an easy recipe.  I did add a slurry of 3 tbs. cornstarch and 1/4 cup of water.  Used a ham bone from Thanksgiving dinner and a few extra slices of ham.  Served with hot sourdough baguette and topped off later with pecan pie and home made whipped cream.  Thank you SABryson for a super easy and delicious recipe.

We make this in our house a lot during the winter months.  BUT,  I always cook the beans in plain water until they are soft, then do your thing.  I know for a fact that if you salt your dried Great Northern beans before cooking they will never soften up.  I've never tried pinto beans any other way either.  They turn out great every time doing it my; way.  This the way I wass taught when a kid and have never changed it.  Why mess with something that has always worked for me.   This is a great winter meal.

I make this and variations on it all the time. I do, however recommend buying ham shanks versus hocks as there is much more meat on the shanks. I also boil my hocks/skanks until the meat falls off the bone and the marrow has all melted into the liquid. Then I can remove the bones and whatever fat I want to before adding the beans, onions, and spices, etc. Then all I have to worry about is the texture of the beans and the cornbread that’s in my cast iron skillet in the oven or my smoker. If the shanks/hocks I buy aren’t smoked I add a bit of liquid smoke to the pot. One of my go-to comfort meals.

Instead of half water and low sodium chicken broth, I only used the chicken broth. (8 cups)  I stir fried the onions, garlic (4 cloves), hamhocks & the hambone first...until a fond developed on the stock pot's bottom.  Then I added the beans (soaked overnight) and stir fried them for about 2 minutes before adding the chicken broth.  As suggested, cooked on high for a full hour, then simmered for 2 hours. (Gas cook range)  A dash of salt is added after serving.  DELICIOUS AND EASY RECIPE!!!

My Southern husband approved, and between the two of us, we almost finished off the whole pot! My minor tweaks based on preference: did the initial quick soak with water only and discarded the soak water, then added fresh water and the rest of the ingredients for the remaining cook time. Cuts WAY down on the gas factor. Simmered uncovered to get the thick broth I wanted and added more water as needed. Subbed 8 oz diced ham for the ham hock—should have reduced the added salt by probably half, but it was still good, if a little salty. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

Excellent recipe. Best Pinto Beans I've ever made. I do replace the water and bullion with broth and sometimes use garlic powder instead of real garlic. It still comes out great each time I make it.

I am in the processes.  I added celery, used 1lb. 15 bean mix, and had to omit the chili powder..... I'm out! I live in Chicago and as of 2:46 pm December 31st 2017 it is a chilly even 0 outside......and I will not be venturing out!

Ill be back in about 4hrs.
 Ill give it 5stars for now and will adjust if necessary.

This was my first attempt at making something like this.  I doubled the recipe (big family) cooked for around 4.5 hours and  had 2 packages of ham hock with 2 pieces each (not sure if that's considered 2 or 4). No salt added tons of pepper. Turned out great! The family didn't want to eat it after they saw what ham hock was.

Fantastic!  I did 4 cups of water and 4 cups of chicken broth.  I added some diced ham and served with cornbread.  My husband and I ate it over the week and each day it got better.

Excellent recipe.  I soaked my beans overnight in salty water and added a teaspoon or so of dry mustard because i like that in my beans.

Good recipe and great flavor. I soaked my beans overnight, cooked in a crock pot on low for 10 hours, and added chicken  bouillon.  I used a ham hock from  a brown sugar glazed ham, then added chucks of ham that was left over from thanksgiving. Cooking in the crock pot made the ham so tender and good. Definitely will use this recipe again.

Sooooo good! Served them for dinner with turnip greens and cornbread. Leftovers made a great breakfast as huevos rancheros. Hubby doesn't eat pork so I used a lump of duck fat that I'd rendered and frozen, along with a few drops of liquid smoke. Deliciously southern AND kosher!

I did not care for the bay leaf flavor. Next time I will leave it out. I added chopped ham. It was even better the second day.

I've been using this recipe for years now with smoked turkey and a few other added ingredients for my liking. I don't consider myself a real cook or nothing close but everyone I make these for LOVE them. I can't help but to give it 5 stars. Thanks!

Didn't make any changes and it was perfect. It's a keeper for me. Taste like the beans my mother made when  I was growing up. I've never been able to duplicate that taste til now. Thanks for sharing it! So simple, yet so tasty.

I, too, soaked the beans overnight,  drained and rinsed and added the liquid called for (used 4 cups water and 4 cups vegetable broth. I followed the recipe but added one diced carrot and a bay leaf. Following an earlier suggestion, I sautéed the onions, garlic and carrots in a little olive oil before adding them to the pot. I added the salt and some fresh ham pieces during the last half hour after removing the ham bone and bay leaf. I simmered soup for 5 hours covered and then another hour uncovered. We really enjoyed the results and will definitely make it again. I might try adding a second teaspoon of chili powder, though.

I loved how creamy this came out. The only modification was to add the salt at the end. We fought over the leftovers and I even caught him sneaking down at night to steal bites.

I have made this several times when I cook a spiral sliced ham. I ad the juice from the bottom of the pan to my bean pot. I get sugar cured hams. I haven't been brave enough to add the chili powder yet. I always make  4 or more pounds of dry beans and adjust the ingredients for the amount of beans I decide to use. We have an extra freezer so, I cook big all of the time and freeze the extras. I put the ham & bean soup in old 32oz yogurt containers and it is plenty for 2 adults and a child when thawed out. I usually have enough to fill 5 or 6 of these containers and put in the freezer.
 I make cornbread with Non-GMO cornmeal to go with our soup. Cornbread freezes and thaws well to go with leftover soup .
 It has always turned out creamy for me and, I don't take the time to soak the beans and usually add half of the salt at the beginning and then more at the end to taste. I do cook for a full 6 hours though. I do mash the beans a bit with a bean masher, and I think this helps with the creaminess and thickening the soup.

I loved these beans. The only thing I did different is soak the beans overnight, only used 1/2 an onion, and added diced ham. My only complaint would be that they are on the salty side and I didn't even salt them. So probably not at fault of the recipe. Rather, the amount of ham plus the ham hock. I will use this recipe again! Thank you!

I love pinto beans and ham hocks!  When I came across this recipe, it reminded me of the recipe my grandmother used to make for her farm hands as an afternoon meal.  Yummy is all I can say.  I usually modify recipes, but this one I made exactly as it was written.  The beans were tender, the flavors reminded me of winter day.  My ham hocks were perfect.  What a great recipe.  Thank you!  It is now in my permanent recipe box.

These beans were fantastic.  The first time I tried this, I served it to my grandmother and she remarked that it was the best meal she had eaten since she moved to our town nearly three months ago.  I also served fried okra, fried potatoes and cornbread.  I did add some diced ham as another reviewer suggested and I soaked the beans overnight. Thanks for the great recipe.

My family enjoyed this. I had a package of chunked ham shank meat and I used it in place of the ham hock. I also doubled the batch but noticed...to much liquids, which diluted the overall spices, so I ended up boiling longer then expected to decrease the amount of water I added and had to had increase the spices by a 3rd more to compensate. However, had I stuck to a single batch...no compromising with the recipe as is. It filled our bellies and all was happy. SO thank you.

OMG!  I just got finished eating it now!  Burp! It was soooooo good!  Oh and reminded me of my childhood!  I had it with cornbread and sliced onions and tomatoes....delicious.  I think key is simmering for several hours, allow to sit in refrigerator and eat the next day!  I will make this again!

This was good! A tiny bit bland, so we had to add hot sauce to it, but that was expected, and the hot sauce made it tasty. We added a splash of Worcestershire, and a splash of Dale's while it was cooking. I think it'll be better tomorrow after it's thickened up a bit.

I use almost the same seasoning big difference is this would kill me! I was taught through many generations soak your beans over night in water adding a teaspoon of baking soda to release the gas, rinse throughly...Can't eat garlic so I use onion powder; and sometimes a handfull of coarse chopped carrots.

This was pretty good.  I added more chili powder than called for, and it still was not very spicey.  It had a nice flavor, though.

I made this tonight using half of a leftover bone-in ham. It was amazing! I followed the advice of another reader and soaked the beans overnight in water and salt. I threw everything in a pot and brought it to a boil, then simmered for a little over an hour. The beans were just the right consistency. I'll definitely be making this again!

Classic Recipe. My own mother taught me to add Great Northern Beans as well. And while hamhocks are great, the last of a baked ham is excellent as well.

The addition of the chili powder makes such a difference!  I will never make beans without it!  For slow cooker recipe fans, soak the beans overnight & then put ingredients in the crock pot on low for 6 - 7 hours & they come out perfect!  I also substitute the ham hock for a package of cubed ham and use a bit of chicken broth in place of some of the water. Good stuff!

I crock-potted this dish instead of boiling it, but otherwise followed the directions to a "T" and the beans were unbelievably bland. After cooking for 6 hours in the crock on low, the beans were not done (so FYI crockpot folks, you'll need more time) but at least I was able to catch the fact that they needed more seasonings. I ended up doubling the garlic, and salt,then added 2 bay leafs, turned the crock to high and let them cook another 5 hours. After adding the extra seasonings when the beans were done cooking they were amazing!  I'm rating it 3 stars because of the lack of flavor, not the cooking time b/c that was my mistake.

I printed off this recipe in Jan. '05 and have been using it ever since to rave reviews. Sometimes I add more chili powder and the can of chopped green chilis.  It makes the best beans ever! Thanks, Sarah.

Great ham and beans recipe!  I add a can of tomatoes and diced chillies, fresh cut green beans, extra garlic and sometimes cayenne.  Thanks for the recipe!

We made this today and it was wonderful! We used several Ham Hocks, and probably added 2 cups of water to the 8 called for. We bought a Ham Steak and cut it into small pieces, added it maybe an hour before serving. We served it over rice. This will definitely become a staple for our family!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It needed a little more of a kick for me to give it a 5 star.  I am thinking of adding a chopped jalepeno to get the kick.  Great recipe!

We made it per recipe and it was way too bland!  So my husband and I doctored it up slowly spice by spice.  We added oregano, red pepper flakes and nutmeg, by taste.  Came out much better.

Great basic recipe. I used cubed ham because I have a hard time finding ham hocks at my local grocery store. Also, I added a bit of creole seasoning to add some more flavor. I also added some peppers and pepper juice because I like everything spicy.

Great! I usually end up using quite a bit more salt than 1 teaspoon, the beans soak it up so much. It will depend on the type of hock you get though.

Perfect amount of seasoning.  Great taste...my whole family loved it. I did cheat and use 1 tsp of onion powder rather than chopping up an onion.

These are a lot like my families "soup beans" I must suggest that you try them with sweet pickle relish on top... trust me it is really good and you only need a spoon full.  Also, fresh chopped onions and some cornbread (maybe fried apples too, ha ha) they are a meal in themselves and a favorite!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I don't use the ham hock, I just chop up left over ham and put that in.  I also cook this all day long in a slow cooker.  My kids and I love this.  I always freeze the left over in quart size freezer bags for a quick dinner later.  Thanks for such an easy, tasty recipe!

This is exactly what I was looking for & it was great.  Even my picky four year old polished it off.  Definitely a keeper. Thanks!
