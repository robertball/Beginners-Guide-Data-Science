I replaced 1/2 cup water with white wine and soaked the saffron in it before adding (I learned this from a Spanish friend)-terrific!

I've made this a few times now, and learned one important lesson.  Don't make this if you don't have the fresh tomatoes.  The flavors did not come together without them.  I recently made this with chicken and no seafood, and liked it just as much. This dish is a favorite of my whole family, even my son who doesn't like rice - he once tried to order paella without the rice in a restaurant!

yummy but the recipe 'Bring the fish stock and 3 cups salted water to a boil' doesnt say how much of the fish stock to use. so i just estimated and it came out a bit moist.
