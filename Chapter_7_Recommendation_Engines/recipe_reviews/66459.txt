You do have to rinse the brine off the grape leaves.  It comes with the directions.  These are lovely, who would have ever thought of gorgonzola and grape leaves?  What a great thing for a cocktail buffet!  I finally threw up my hands and said "There are no more!".

Overall, I thought this was a great recipe.  I would make one change.  It was a bit salty for my taste.  I would suggest rinsing the grape leaves to remove the brine.  I also served it warm with some tomato sauce.  It was very good this way as well.

Dynamite! I used the leaves soaked in vinegar brine, which I prefer as they have a milder flavor, rinsed and drained them. I also had a lot to make so I flushed out the filling with some rice (not much) to keep my costs down. I used a mix of macademia nuts, walnuts and pine nuts since I had them on hand, tomatoes and onions out of my garden. These were a huge hit, everyone thrilled to see a vegetarianstuffed grapeleaf. I will make these again, and again!

This is absolutely delicious, but it is very expensive, and needs to be strained a few times over; the juice was dripping down my hosts chins. Also, if you get big grape leaves, put a little more mix in it. There shouldnt be more grape leaves than mix.

Overall, this was a huge hit.  My only complaint is that even without the brine it was a bit too salty.  We did love the filling.  For those who don't adore grape leaves, we used the extra as a topping for bruschetta with a little honey drizzled on top.  That was amazing.

Lots of work, lots of ingredients, lots of yummy taste for those with a discriminating palate. Great as an appetizer to the Prunes and Olives Chicken dish. Impresses the guests!

My husband has held that he would NEVER enjoy Gorgonzola and has turned it down every time it infiltrated his food - but this he loved!  In fact, everyone at the party loved this - even those who appeared to be less than enthusiastic about "whatever was in those leaves."  Try it!  It takes a little time, but isn't hard to wrap up the leaves (they don't tear on you.)  Yummy! Intensely yummy!

The filling had an excellent flavour but did not work well for us in grape leaves.  The process of stuffing the leaves was onerous and they were messy to eat.  We ended up using the filling as a "bruchetta" on small toasts of bread.  That was very well received for flavour but didn't look too appealing.  Might use again as part of an hors d'oeuvres tray but would never try the grape leaves again.  Interesting experiment though!

This was too runny. It needs some rice to absorb the liquid- and using fresh grape leaves is a no-no with this recipe. Cooking the rolls with the leaves did not work. Delicious ingredients, but had to throw them out because it was too much of a mess to eat them, even with all the flavor.

We enjoyed this dish & since I was serving many other dishes I appreciated putting these grape leaves together a day ahead of time and serving cold.  I did use up the entire jar of leaves about 40 with just this one recipe.  It definetly makes more than 20 rolled leaves

This was simple and easy to make.  Next time around I will use minced garlic from a jar and cut it back, the amount of fresh garlic was just too overpowering for us. I really enjoyed the flavors and texture of the filling. Thank you!

I loved this filling sprinkled over my salads, on crostini spread with marscapone, and every other combination I came up with to use up the leftover grape leaves.  It was just the two of us and I made the entire recipe.  I kept going back to the filling.  Such a crazy combination of flavors and textures that I really enjoyed. Just I found I really didn't care for it in the grape leaves.
