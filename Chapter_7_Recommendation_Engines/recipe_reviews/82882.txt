Don't drain the tuna: you're draining off flavor. Drain the peas instead.
I added about a tablespoon of onion soup mix as well. Had it as a gravy over mashed potatoes. Pretty good, very easy: will make again.

I've loved this recipe since my Grandmother made me for it as a child - she called it 'creamed tuna on toast'.  Since she passed away I could not figure out how to 're-create' it - thank you so much !!

You will need salt & seasonings!  I used salt, pepper, & garlic powder in order to make this less bland.  EASY recipe and very filling!

Excellent receipe-- just like mom used to make.  However, I add 2 or even 3 cans of tuna to make it chunkier and up the protein.

My mom always made this for me and my dad when I was little.  She still does for him on occasion. She doesn't put the peas in it and we only have it on toast.  I actually love this for breakfast.  It's a great alternative to biscuits and gravy and it is so much easier to make.  It usually only takes me about 30 minutes to make, but I've been making it since I was little.

I don't make this recipe the exact same way, although I must say, it is a great dish.

My mom puts a chopped onion in first (brown it) This might help those who find it bland.

This was not very good in my opinion. 2 cans of tuna was used, and after 45 minutes simmering, it still didn't thicken up so cornstarch was needed. Very bland as well. You will want to spruce this up with more modern ingredients, maybe fresh/frozen peas, some spices (garlic, onion, pepper, and parsley), and some cheese/breadcrumbs on top would help make this more palatable. A good first attempt, just not quite there yet. Also, instead of being served on toast, I would try it on plain cooked pasta, like tuna noodle cassarole.

The kids ate it.  I thought it was OK, but bland (added *a lot* of salt and pepper to mine).  I made with corn b/c I was out of peas and I added an extra can of tuna.  Will make again b/c the kids liked it and ate their veggies.
