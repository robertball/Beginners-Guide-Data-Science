Amazing! I jazzed it up a tiny bit more because I like a hearty panini, so I sauteed spinach, red onions and garlic in olive oil and added that to the mix. Everyone loved it!

Loved these! Added advice; tear prosciutto into pieces and cut the peppers into smaller slices, so when you eat the sandwich, the whole pieces do not come out...YUM! I think I'll have it for lunch today! Can't wait!

Had these for dinner tonight using a salami/prosciutto blend but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  EXCELLENT!! Only complaint is the meat tended to come out all at once when you bit into the sandwich. Not sure what to do about that except  let them cool off a bit before serving. But the taste of the sandwich was awesome and will be doing this and variations of this recipe again. Thanks for posting.

it was definitely tasty. I'm new to making paninis so I probably need to try out some different breads. My husband commented it was very salty, which is to be expected given this meat.

Good recipe! I fire roasted fresh peppers instead of using jarred ones, otherwise no change.  Next time I'll take the advice of another reviewer to cut peppers and prosciutto into smaller pieces. My husband thought some spicy peppers would improve it.
