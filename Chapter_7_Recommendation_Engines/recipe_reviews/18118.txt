Absolutly fab stuffing, I found that using a stuffing mix that would go well with spinach was the key. I also added some grated cheese for added moisture and it went really well.

As easy it was to make, this just wasn't very good. Perhaps it was the canned spinach, but it didn't really stick together and the taste was way off. I don't think I will be making this again.
