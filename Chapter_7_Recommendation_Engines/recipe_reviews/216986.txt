This ia almost the same as the one I've been making for years except I put everything in a large sauce pan on top of the stove and cook everything until it thickened up and I can taste it to be sure its right, I have found over the years that the flavor depends on the the berries and rhubarb being used, sometimes they are not as sweet as other times.There is nothing more up setting than having used all the ingredients and having your pie come out too tart or too sweet. Anyway I let my mixture cool abit then put a lattice top on and bake. I do this with all my fruit pies, and it works everytime.

This pie came out perfectly! The sweetness is just right, though I did skimp on the sugar by about 1/4 cup. Highly recommended.

This recipe was REALLY yummy, but the filling was too much for the pan. It was also very liquid and took extra long to bake. I recommend using 1.5 cups of diced rhubarb with 2 cups hulled strawberries and 1/2 cup flour in the filling. 
On a side note... I found the "ready to use" frozen doughNfoil sets to be very dry. I recommend making the dough from scratch. You can get a basic dough mix in the cake section of the supermarket and then kneading it by hand. Makes it REALLY special!

I am a rookie baker and this pie turned out really great! I over did the nutmeg a bit since I didn't pre-measure it (just grated it in the bowl).  I followed the advice of one review and combined all the ingredients in a sauce pan over medium heat first to taste and after it cooled I added it to the crust.

Also, I brushed a beaten egg and water mix over the top crust before putting it in the oven to assist in getting a golden crust.

I was unsure about the whole berries but it worked really well!

Overall a very nice recipe and so easy!!

I did not have great results.  It tasted wonderful, but was more like strawberry rhubarb pie crust with sauce...I have yet to have a whole berry strawberry pie turn out:(. Followed the directions too.

We went strawberry picking and wanted to try  this type of as I was gifted a good amount of rhubarb. This is one of the best tasting fruit pies ever! I used store bought pie crust and cinnamon to the filling.  It baked beautifully. I am saving this recipe to make again.

Made it just as written. Way too wet. Taste okay, but I think if I make it again I'll use corn starch or tapioca to thicken it. Disappointing.

I'm not a baker, but have been craving a strawberry rhubarb pie, so I gave it a go with a store bought crust. I left it open without a lid/lattice. It was good, but too wet. I think that's my fault; I don't think I mixed the flour through very well. I was also looking for more of the tart flavour from the rhubarb. 

I will make this again, but will add a little more flour, making sure to mix it through thoroughly. I will also put a bit more rhubarb with a little less strawberry. Overall I was pleased with it, now just need to tweak it to my liking.

I added some orange peel and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Very tasty!

I found this very sweet. I would exchange the strawberry and rhubarb totals for a more tart pie. Otherwise it was quite yummy. Instead of flour I used small bead tapioca. It soaks up the moisture without adding flavour.
