I was looking for a cabbage soup recipe and this seemed to fit the bill but it's really boring. After I followed the recipe I tasted it and was unimpressed so I added some garlic chili sauce red pepper flakes a can of diced tomatoes and Italian seasoning. That made it better. But I'll be looking for a new recipe next time I have a craving for cabbage soup.
