I made a copycat Lofthouse cookie recipe that I found on another website and used this recipe to frost them. I did not have natural shortening, I used Crisco. This is simple to make recipe that was easy to work with/spread onto the cookies and seemed to be very close to the Lofthouse cookie frosting, which is the end result I was looking for.

This is great!  I made exactly as described, except I did a half batch.  I made it to draw a football shape on my brownies for the Super Bowl.  It's exactly the right consistency.  I may never buy decorator frosting again!!

Very easy to make. I used Crisco as it is trans-fat free.  I also used organic vanilla as that is what I had on hand. For the milk I added until the frosting was at my desired consistency (I wanted to be able to pipe it for gingerbread men).  We used for gingerbread and roll out sugar cookies.
