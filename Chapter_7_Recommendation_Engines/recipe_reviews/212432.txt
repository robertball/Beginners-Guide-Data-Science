If you cut the baking powder down to 1 TBSP and add an egg they come out perfect!

Being a pancake lover and loving crunchy peanut butter I was sure this was going to be great. I think I prefer regular pancakes. Kind of strange texture.

These pancakes were delicious and very easy to make.  I ran out of baking powder and only used 1 Tbsp, but they definitely weren't too flat.  The batter was the perfect consistency and not one pancake turned out too dark.  I sprinkled mini chocolate chips over each pancake for a special treat.

Although these pancakes turned out very light, they also had a little bit of a bitter taste. I'm thinking it's from too much baking powder. I understand the baking powder is what helps them to be light, but I would rather not taste it. It took a lot of syrup to drown out that bitterness. I like the peanut butter idea; I even added some chocolate chips to some of mine, and they were really good (after the bitter taste). I will make these again with my own batter and I'm sure I will like them all the more. Thanks for the idea!

I used whole wheat white flour and cut the baking powder down to only one tablespoon. These pancakes were very easy though the serving suggestion was way off. It made enough pancakes for my two kids and husband. My kids especially liked these pancakes--they ate them with my homemade strawberry freezer jam.

Very good! Followed recipe exactly. Great with butter and syrup. I think next time I am going to use Strawberry syrup with it, so it will be like pb&j.

These were very tasty and fluffy, my daughter epecially loved them! However, i made a few changes.  I did half peanut butter and half almond butter. The batter was extremely thick and not cooking poperly, so i added another 1/3 cup milk and then they were great! Thanks for the recipe :)

Great texture, but rather bland. Peanut butter taste is very muted.  Probably won't make again.

Alright, not worth the time, they puffed up beautifully, then went flat. They were so light, that they fell apart to easily.

I liked the idea of peanut butter pancakes but these had a really bitter funky taste to them. I did cut the baking powder down to 2 tsp but maybe 1 1/2 would have been better. Even 1 tsp maybe. The kids liked these though. Served with chocolate syrup and whipped cream.

I was amazed at how fluffy these were, they're not your plain old, heavy pancakes. I made a few changes since I didn't have all the ingredients. I used almond butter instead of peanut and almond milk instead of regular milk - so I can at least say they were great that way.

I served a brunch for 30 people, and had these pancakes as the second course. I've used this recipe 3 or 4 times now. I listened to what everyone said and scaled back on the baking powder. I replaced JIF with ground up peanut butter chips, adding them with the dry ingredients. 
To say that the pancakes were a success is an understatement! People LOVED them! I made a raspberry maple syrup to go with them like a PB&J sandwich. 
Don't trust the serving size, to make enough for 30 people, I had to calculate a recipe for 190 servings.

Very fun and easy to make. I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy because I have a tactile deficient child at home. And all my kids (and myself) adore it! Well done.

We love peanut butter, but these pancakes just got so-so reviews at our house. Perhaps they would be better as an evening treat coated with powdered sugar, but as a morning pancake, they just weren't right. We used creamy peanut butter (no crunchy lovers) and it changed the pancake texture to more closely match that of the peanut butter. Adding butter on top of the pancake helped, but none of us could quite combine the peanut butter smell and taste with maple syrup.

My whole family enjoyed these pancakes.  I wish I had the extra crunchy PB.  It would have been delicious.  I only had creamy.  However, if you make these, they soak up the syrup so be prepared.  They raises up nice and fluffy.  I followed the directions exactly.

I added a couple of bananas that were so brown I had to fight the gnats for them. Bananas took these to the next level of goodness, as in" sitting in a diner at 5 a.m. waiting for your breakfast because you had an awesome night and you haven't been to bed yet" kind of good!

Pretty good. I used creamy instead of crunchy PB because my kids don't like crunchy pb. It was a bit bland, you can taste the PB, but it was bland. I think it needs a little salt. I didn't think it did with the PB in it, but I think that would help.

i loved the way it came out but i made adjustments... i didn't have crunchy peanut butter so i used creamy peanut butter...added some cinnamon and a pinch of vanilla... lastly i only added 1 tablespoon of baking powder since some reviews said it tasted bitter and to much baking powder will do that... after these adjustments they were perfect for me fluffy and yummy :)

After reading the other advice I used a little less than a Tbsp of baking powder and 2 eggs.  I also only have all natural peanut butter.  I thought the pancakes came out tasting fairly boring, maybe because Jif pb has more salt than mine?  Tried compensating by adding some sale but also added chocolate - one of them helped but I don't know which!  They were fine, but not over-the-top delicious by any means.

Super! Top of my pancake recipe list, for sure. Unbelievable fluffy and the perfect sweetness if you use no-sugar-added real chunky salted peanut butter. I'm really amazed, they are so good!

It's fine.  It just didn't stay together very well; the consistency was annoying (can food be annoying?).  I think I will stick with the good old fashioned pancakes recipe and keep putting my PB on top,  mmmm!

As per other reviewers' suggestions, I cut back on baking powder, using 1 Tablespoon.  I also used 1/3 cup of liquid egg substitute instead of the 1/4 cup that would equal 1 egg.  They turned out great!  I would definitely make them again!
