This is my all-time favorite drink.  So refreshing and so tasty.  Make sure you chill it before drinking or add lots of ice.

This is such a wonderful combination of flavors.  I plan on making this one frequently as the warmer months approach.  Measurements were spot on.  I also love that you can reduce the sugar and still get a wonderful beverage.

This is a delicious and refreshing way to up your water intake throughout the day! I really think people who aren't fond of cucumber by itself will like this. I used stevia instead of Splenda.

Very refreshing. The colder, the better. Preferring tart to sweet, I left out the sweetener.

The ingredients are enough for a gallon. You do need to add more splenda to taste. It taste wonderful!

Nice flavors, definitely best with ice. It is very pulpy from the cucumber. I had to add a bit more sweetner than called for. I ended up straining out some of the pulp and liked it even better. I will make this again, thanks!

The only change I made was to use a small amount of grade B maple syrup instead of sugar.  We had an open house for friends who were in town from overseas.  I made a large quantity of this and everyone really loved it!  Had a small amount left and overnight, it thickened up so I added some water and lime juice and drank the last of it myself.  :)

I made this for a party for a non-alcolic base that people could add tequila to if they wanted.  It was very popular - very fresh tasting and not sweet.  I ran out of limes the second batch and used limeade - also very good.  Be mindful to thoroughly puree the cucumber or it is a bit chewy.

I made this as a fermented soda, using 1/2 cup of ginger bug to the gallon of cucumber lime juice , sugar and water.  Took 3 days to ferment and get fizzy .... wonderful combo!  This will be a favorite in our fridge.

3.19.18  I love cucumber water, and the addition of that lime juice really enhances the flavor.  My cucumber was unwaxed, so I didn’t bother to peel it, that’s why the drink in the photo is so green.  Since I don’t like things too sweet these days, I left out the sweetener, and enjoyed the tang of that lime.  Spent a couple hours working in the yard this morning, and this cucumber limeade over crushed ice really hit the spot.

I really enjoy this recipe. Personally, I like a strong, tart  lime flavor so I double the lime juice. Just a word of caution, this wonderful, healthy & refreshing drink is FULL of fiber. You may want to consider using English or Burpless cucumbers.
