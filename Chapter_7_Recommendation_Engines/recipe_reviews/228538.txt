Delicious! We eat a few veggie dinners a week, and this was a great alternative to traditional (even vegetarian) lasagne. I am Italian, so I doctored it up a bit, used homemade sauce, and added some things. I sauteed garlic, onion, and 2 zucchini in olive oil first while the spaghetti squash was cooking. Then, I added the two squashes together and mixed the cheese mixture. I used a whole container of skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese (similar calories) with the parm, and mozz. I added lots of italian herbs and two eggs to the cheese mixture. I don't like mine super saucey, so I only topped with marinara and then with more parm and mozz. Baked 30 mins and was delish. My husband took the next two days to work for lunch and was pleased with it! And he LOVES pasta!

Great!  Not too low carb, but a great way to get that Italian taste! Cooking4-5---wash the squash, cut in half, scrape out seeds and nuke for a good 15 minutes.  Let cool and then just scrape out the squash w/a fork and enjoy as you would any noodle!  And add some Italian sausage, for cryin' out loud!!!

I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and mixed up my own blend of Italian spices.  Rather than use slices I made the squash in the traditional way, raking the squash strands from a cooked spaghetti squash.  My preferred method of cooking spaghetti squash is to cut it in half, remove the seeds, and bake, cut side down, for about 25 to 30 minutes at 375 degrees. I put half of the squash in the bottom of the pan, added half the sauce and topped with the ricotta cheese mixture.  Another layer of squash, more sauce, the Parmesan cheese and some additional mozzarella completed the lasagna.  The addition of Italian sausage would be great. This vegetarian and gluten free meal will grace our table again!

I took it to a friend of mine who is sensitive to gluten and she said it was good. Not enough instructions on how to prepare the spaghetti squash... Should you bake it first? Or jus peel and slice it?

We were amazed how much this tasted like lasa.  I prepared the squash more traditionally: baked and scraped out of the shell then drained.  I've also found if I add a couple tablespoons of flour to whatever sauce I'm baking the squash with it really helps the watery factor.  I added spinach to the cottage cheese layer and mushrooms, tomatoes, and bell pepper to the spaghetti sauce just because I had them and they needed to be used up.  Amazing!

This is definitely a recipe I will try again! It was a huge pain to cut up and peel the squash, so next time I will bake the squash first and scoop! (I've never made spaghetti squash before!) The flavor was great and was super easy other that cutting the squash. I think I will also double the amount of squash in comparison to the amount of sauce/cheese.  I usually use ricotta,  but loved the texture the cottage gave!

we really enjoyed this dish.. i cut the recipe in half as our squash was on the smaller side.. it wouldn't even spread into one layer in a 2 quart pyrex so i had to use two smaller vessels.. i forgot the salt and parm and probably used more than half the can of spaghetti sauce.. i made sure to prebake the squash and scoop out the flesh, layering with the spaghetti sauce on the bottom, squash, cottage cheese mixture (had to sub jack for mozz), fresh spinach, and seasoned ground turkey (repeat etc).. i topped the final layers with some more shredded jack.. bf said he didn't miss the pasta in this at all.. ty for the recipe

Delicious. Made a great meal. I used spaghetti squash frozen from last year, already grated, so my lasagna ended up more like a casserole. Also, I added ground beef to the cottage cheese mixture. Turned out wonderfully.

Super yum. Cooked the spaghetti squash in the micro before, and added a layer of zucchini and some veggie crumbles.

It was so good, you could barely tell that the spaghetti squash was not pasta.

I followed the directions and it turned out to be very tasty. I will definitely make this again. However, I agree there was something missing with regard to how to cook/prep the squash. We were a bit put off by the hard rind still on the spaghetti squash the way I prepared it. We took a deep breath and peeled the rinds away, stirred it up, and loved it!

I thought this was delicious, although I did add turkey Italian sausage.  II cooked my squash in the microwave for 15 minutes and then shredded it rather than cutting it into cubes.  I also only had 1/2 a spaghetti squash, so I just cut the ingredients in half and omitted the salt completely because cottage cheese is already salty.  I didn't have enough squash to cover the top with it, so it ended up being squash, sausage, cottage cheese mixture, spaghetti sauce, parmesan and more Italian cheese on top.  Baked for 20 minutes at 375 and it was perfection!

The next time I make this I will cook the spaghetti squash ahead of time and drain it. This was not very good. It had the ability to be delicious but it was too soupy and the spaghetti squash wasn't like spaghetti . By not cooking at first you just have crunchy lumps.

I tried it as written, but the squash didn't cook. Raw chunks of squash covered in melted cheese and sauce didn't do it for me, so I tried cooking it at 400 degrees for another 30 minutes (65 minutes total), and it still wasn't that good. Squash was a weird texture, and all the cheese in the world couldn't fix it. I'll probably finish the leftovers, but definitely won't make it again.

I made this with the ingredients as written and it is good. However I kept thinking there should be more veg...Onion! Zucchini! Mushroom! I will probably add them next time. I did prepare my spaghetti squash differently than instructed. I didn't think it would be easy to peel, so I fixed it like I always do. Cut in half, scoop out seeds with ice cream scoop then spray with Pam and Place them with the inside down on a sprayed cookie sheet. Roast at 350 for 30-40 minutes, (depending on size ).  Then hold with a pot holder and use a fork to pull out the "spaghetti".  I added the rest of ingredients on top of the cooked squash then did not have to bake as long, just to hear through and melt the cheese. A nice vegetarian meal!

This was good and easy to make. I also added some Italian sausage. The next time I make it I may add a little Italian bread crumbs to soak up the liquid but it wasn't too runny.

The most ridiculous and nearly impossible .....peel a squash?  I was so angry  at this recipe because of the nearly "losing a finger process" of trying to actually peel the squash I was ready to throw it out the window (literally).  That and the frustration of the cooking process taking twice the amount of time indicated was  the reason for the low rating.  That  being said...it did taste very good but I will never attempt this recipe again just not worth the work.  Maybe zucchini would be a better option??

this was perfect for my boyfriend's low carb diet. we made a large pan and ate all of it! it was absolutely delicious! the only down side is the prep. The spaghetti squash took some serious work to get chopped up and peeled. I am a young strong  woman and I have to say I was tired after prepping that thing for at least ten minutes. I told my boyfriend "don't go in the kitchen I pretty much butchered and dissected a squash" (it was a mess)  but it was worth it. next time I will add some hamburger for protein.

Not sure I'd call it lasagna, but it is very delicious.  My family tries to do a vegetarian dish once or twice a week, and this one was a hit.  The leftovers didn't last long.

I thought it was really good!  Next time I would decrease the sauce slightly & pre cook the squash and shred it before I put it in the lasagna.  Also, this would hopefully help with it being too watery.  It would be good with some ground turkey if you want to make it a meat dish.

We loved this recipe.  I cooked the squash first then used a fork to "rake" the strands out.  I added cooked Italian Sausage to the top.  It was excellent and gave us another serving of vegetables.
