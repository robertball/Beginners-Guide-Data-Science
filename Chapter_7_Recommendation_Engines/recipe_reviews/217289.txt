This was most excellent. I had no wine or red wine vinegar so I used extra chicken broth and cider vinegar respectively. I also didn't have any mustard seed, so I just squirted in about a teaspoon and a half of spicy brown mustard. The taste was sensational! Just ta hint of mustard with the spice of thyme and all the other flavors made for a delicious meal. I live by myself and used six thighs, so I have two more meals out of this batch. I can't wait to eat them! This would be great to serve any company that I may have. Did I say this was delicious???

The flavor of this was actually really good.  However, I baked it covered in tin foil, so the chicken came out kind of gray-ish.  Next time I'm going to brown it first in a cast iron skillet, then add the veggies and bake it in the skillet.  But like I said, the flavor was good and it was pretty easy to throw together.

This was ok.  The flavor of the chicken was good.  However the potatos need to be cut smaller than 1" square because they did not good through.
