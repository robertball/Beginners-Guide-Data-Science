I'm English, and apart from the addition of the pie crust (which I omitted), this is pretty authentic. Like others, I used a little ketchup instead  of tomato paste. Also, I used Bisto Gravy Granules (from the British food store I go to) to thicken it. Finally, I threw in a handful of frozen peas. (Btw, Shepherd's Pie is made with ground lamb; Cottage Pie with ground beef).

Being from Australia, cottage pie is a favourite when it comes to comfort food for the family. Overall, this recipe is pretty close to the orignial. Defeinitely omit the cinnamon. Not sure why you would want to add cinnamon to a traditional cottage pie. Like a lot of other reviewers, i added worsteshire sauce, approx 2 teaspoons, as well as 1/2 cup of peas. I'd also recommend cutting back on the cheese. Just enough to brown on top of the mashed potato is sufficient. Finally, stick to lean ground beef...you can cut back on the the oily, greasy film which can overpower the taste of all other ingredients...as well as the waistline

This was very good, but not earth-shaking.  I agree with other reviewers on several points: (1) Though cinnamon can add a nice element with red meat, here it comes through too strongly; cut back quite a bit on the amount. (2) Use less milk in the potatoes - just make them however you usually make your mashed potatoes. (3) I used water instead of beef broth and added some worcestershire sauce because the meat mixture seemed to need some extra flavor.  Next time I would go a step further and use some garlic and extra seasonings to perk it up.  Enjoy!

I am English and this recipe seems to be pretty authentic.  However, cinnamon would not be used in an English dish like this.  I have noticed a couple of reviewers mention a pie crust and it not being authentic to the recipe.  I agree, Cottage Pie does not have a pie crust, but I can see no reference to it in this recipe.  As mentioned in another review, Worcestershire Sauce adds valuable flavor to the meat in this dish.  Don't add too much tomato paste, if any and just play around with herbs til you get the flavor you like.  You don't need to whip the potatoes, just make them as you normally would and spoon them onto the meat - the rougher, the better.  I even fluff mine with a fork before adding the cheese, which makes the peaks a little crunchy.  This dish is not meant to be complicated, so keep it simple.  It's a quick and easy meal to make on a budget.  A great comfort food and very tasty.

The pie was very good.  My husband enjoys English dishes and I expected something like the "shepherd's pie" that was served in the school cafeteria many years ago.  For a hamburger meal, it had a lovely, complex flavor.  I followed the recipe except for using a pie crust, which does not seem authentic.  I doubled the meat portion of the recipe and froze it in the pie plate to be topped with mashed potatoes later for a busy night meal.  Also, I take a can of tomato paste and empty it into a zip baggy for freezing, then just break off what is needed (be sure to flatten paste before freezing).

I made this will slighly over a pound of ground beef and 4 large russet potatos.  I absolutely NEEDED a 9 by 13 inch casserole dish!  It would have certainly boiled over in a pie dish or an 8 by 8 dish.  This recipe turned out wonderful!  I changed the recipe a bit because I was just using ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't use carrots, used chicken broth instead of beef, and used 1 tbsp dried parsley instead of fresh.  I also used the full amount of milk and would do it that way again, although it would probably be fine with less.  I used the full amount of cinnamon, and hardly noticed it.  It didn't seem "overpowering" at all.  I also added garlic salt to the potatos for more flavor.  I'll make this one again!

This is a good basic recipe, but be prepared to make some changes. I did not have "Italian seasonings" so I just added a couple pinches garlic powder, basil and oregano. Also red pepper flakes and cumin. I did add a small pinch of cinnamon. I'm glad I did, it gave it an authentic taste and makes a difference. Also, be sure to add a lot more salt than is called for. I added a bunch more pinches, and I also added generous amounts of Wort. sauce. Otherwise, this would have been pretty bland. Just keep tasting the meat throughout the process and keep adding until you like it. I also added frozen peas to the meat mixture.

Dennis the Menice really loved this recipe.  I made a few changes though.  I didn't have any fresh parsley laying around so I used about 1 Tbsp dried parsley.  I ran to the store to get tomato paste (which I hate buying a whole can of tomato paste for just 1 Tbsp).  As a previous review stated using ketchup instead adds a little sweetness to the recipe so I added an additional 1 Tbsp of ketchup too.  Next time I'll just use the ketchup.  I also added 1 Tbsp of Worchestershire (a must) and 1 tsp of dijon mustard for a little zing.  For the mashed potatoes, I nuked some of Stoffers frozen garlic mashed potatoes and spread it on top of the meat mixture to save time.  Quick, easy and delish.

This was great! I added a can of peas between the meat and potato layers (because I like peas) and doubled the cheese (because I LOVE cheese). I'm not sure why everyone is griping about pie crust. It says to put it in a pie TIN. It says nothing about crust. I just did the whole process in a cast iron skillet, though. Stove to oven, no problem.

What a runny mess!  Followed the recipe to the letter. Too much milk in the potatoes.  Used a deep dish pie plae and put on foil covered cookie sheet.  Very glad I did or would have had a huge mess to clean up in the oven.  Carrots didn't get done either.  Sorry but won't be making this again.

My family & I REALLY enjoyed this! I even mashed some up for my 9-month old son...he loved it! The cinnamon gives everything such a rich, savory taste. I planned on freezing any leftovers, but there were hardly any left!

First, I was confused about folks who say they didn't use a pie crust.  This recipe says put in a pie PLATE - ??  Secondly I agree about buying a can of tomato paste for just a spoonful - you can buy tomato paste now in a tube; use what you need and put the tube into the frig for another time.   Also, a nice touch other than mashed potatoes is to use frozen, thawed hash browns.

I put this in my recipe box 3 years ago and finally made it two weeks ago. LOVED it. Loved it loved it! Big hit with my "men" I did substitute ketchup for the tomato paste, because I didn't want to open a whole can for that, and it was great. Also I threw in a can of corn (maybe not traditional? But good!) This one is a keeper. I am considering putting extras in freezer bags, and then just tossing it in a pie plate and throwing on the fresh potatos. Oh, and I didn't use a pie crust either? I didn't think that was the right way to do it. I don't think it was necessary.  - Update on 01/17/12 I STILL make this regularly. One of my "go to's"

Great dish! A good Fall dinner.  I did add some garlic and Lee & Perrins, though.  I substituted ketchup for tomato paste because I did not have a can of paste already open.  Also, I substituted instant mashed potatoes to save time.  I used the 6-7 serving amounts on the box.

We love this recipe.  With a couple of changes, it turned out just like the one's we had in England.  I added 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp sage to the other herbs.  To the beef broth and tomatoe paste I added 1 T Worcestershire.  I cut back the butter to 2 T and the milk to 1/4 cup.  MMM good!  Thanks Caroline.

It was definitely different to the way my mother and grandmother used to make it, but I have to say that I really enjoyed it - and so did the family! I didn't have any tomato paste so used four large fresh plum tomatoes instead, and omitted the parsley as I likewise had none. The cinnamon added a deliciously different note to the flavour. I cooked up two pounds of ground beef, and doubled up on the other ingredients as a result. I figured that that was more enough to feed five adults and have leftovers to freeze or eat for lunch during the week - but there are no leftovers!

Family loved this -- I did make some minor changes -- I omitted the cinnamon and in place of the beef broth used water and brown gravy powder and worcestershire sauce, and as other reviewers suggested instead of tomato paste I used ketchup and added peas towards the end of cooking in the skillet. I made the potatoes as I normally would and used low-fat cheese on top. Super yummy!

Excellent.  The cinnamon gave it a subtly different flavor and prevented it from tasting like other hamburger pie recipes.  Cinnamon and other spices were used frequently in medieval times with meat dishes, and less cinnamon can certainly be used if desired.  I used more tomato paste and water, just simmered a little longer.  My 8 year old loved it too.

Excellent recipe! I noticed people said the potatoes were runny? I add very little milk to my potatoes at all, ever. This recipe I just whipped the potatoes with a hand mixer, and added the butter, no milk. I also substituted corn starch for the flour for my own dietary need. The end result was fantastic.

My husband loved this one-dish dinner. The cinnamon adds an excellent flavor to the beef, much as cloves do for pork. Instead of serving with peas, I put the peas in with the carrots, and used raw maple-smoked cheddar on top. This was really a great, filling meal. Definitely plan on making it again!

If you're looking for tummy-rubbing, comfort-food, look no further than Cottage Pie! I love making this recipe, and the only changes that I've made are adding peas (my British bud always put peas in his Cottage & Shepherd Pies), & I've gotten to the point of just using instant mashed potatoes (I know, I know, Laaaaazy) but for a quick, wonderful family meal, it totally works, and totally disappears in a puff of "mmm."

Cottage pie is actually made from beef, Shepherds pie from lamb and a Meat pie has a crust and the meat is usually pork.  As a Brit, my husband found this to be untraditional and didn't care for it.  As much as I hate to say it, this pie shouldn't wow you with all kinds of flavor.  The blandness is the appeal, really and why it is considered great comfort food.  Generally, the only spices in it are parsley, thyme, S&P and that's about it.  Adding worcestershire sauce is a must and that gives it some more flavor.  I always caramelize my onions in my Cottage pie, so I did it here.  Note, the carrots should be diced, not chopped and it helps to steam them for a few minutes in a saucepan of boiling water - otherwise they might not get cooked.  I also add frozen peas, which is a must.  Cheese is a nice addition, but whenever I use it, I grate mine and fold it into the potato, not layer it on the top in a greasy lake of baked cheese. My mother in law doesn't use the cheese at all, but instead pours melted butter over the top before baking, then adds a shake or two of paprika for color.  I also use Bisto gravy for a more authentic flavor.  Packaged American gravies just aren't the same.

It's a pretty good recipe. But these changes HAVE to be made to make it better: 1) Reduce milk to 1/3 cup. 2) Instead of measuring out the cinammon, just sprinkle it over the meat is more than enough. 3) Sprinkle just a tablespoon of breadcrumbs over the Cheddar cheese for more dept in the texture. Other than that it was good!!!

My Wife and I thought it was so good. What a wonderful recipe. I did make a few changes. I used twice the amount of cinnamon and triple the cheese. Yes I know you Aussies don't like flavour and do not enjoy cheese like us Canadians ( feel so sorry for you). I also put in mint flakes and nutmeg.
Thank You Caroline

I made this recipe almost as directed.  My onion was huge so I only used half, I added two small celery stalks, and about a cup of green peas (right at the end).  Flour and cinnamon was eyeballed, and butter was supplemented with olive oil as I only had 3Tbsp of butter left in the stick.  Also, I had no fresh parsley so subbed approx. 1 Tbsp dried parsley.  Took someone else's advice and just used ketchup in place of the tomato paste.
I questioned the cinnamon a bit last night as it wasn't a bad flavor, but was certainly obvious.  BUT.  The flavors had a chance to meld overnight and the leftovers taste fantastic.  AND.  My extremely picky son ate every. single. bite. of this, even though he accused me of withholding information regarding the amount of vegetables in the dish (picky, picky...).

This was a simple, delicious meal that needs no alterations. Everyone was a fan and I even went back for seconds which I almost never do. I also love that I almost always have these ingredients on hand. This will definitely be an addition to my dinner recipe rotation.

Very good recipe. I added fresh zucchini because I had some. We served it with mushy peas, also because I had some. I used about the same amount of cinnamon; it wasn't overbearing in my opinion. 

I grated the carrots, which gave it a better texture. The onion was omitted because my girlfriend hates them. 

For the sauce, I used double the tomato paste, 1.5 C water, 2 tsp of beef boullion, a few splashes each of worcestershire and steak sauce. 

I used garlic powder and almond milk in the potatoes. I will definitely make this again!

Great! However the cinnamon was a bit strange- I "subed" it with nutmeg the second time around and found it more to our liking. A good hearty fall meal.

I enjoyed it (somewhat.)  My dinner partner did not.  The cinnamon was overwhelming.  I would try making it again, but cut cinnamon in half.  The mashed potato topping was a little tasteless.  Would recommend that you use your favorite mashed potato recipe.  I used a frozen pie shell, did not cook well.  Came out mushy.  You might want to try making your own bottom crust.  Don't expect pie filling to have a gravy texture.  If you want that type of filling try adding some cornstarch or flour and a little more beef stock when preparing.  Play with it & you might strike taste bud gold!

My mother used to make this (sans cinnamon), it was a childhood favorite of mine. Now I think it has become a favorite of my husband, he had two huge helpings, then grazed on it all evening. I added crimini mushrooms sauteed in butter/garlic w/Madeira, which I thought was a waste, they were almost lost in the meat. 
Overall I found it to be a pleasant dish but a bit boring. Next time I will add some heat, peppers, fresh herbs & spices.

A good basic starter recipe for a nice easy comfort meal.  I added frozen peas, carrots, & corn to the beef mix to sneak more veggies into my kids.  I also increased the cinnamon, sub'd dried celery leaf for the parsley, added basil and paprika, and used onion salt for the salt. I skipped the pie pan and layered the whole thing in the skillet.  I just used the family recipe for mashed potatoes-- yukon gold spuds cooked in broth,  and a bit of cream and cream cheese.  I had mashed potatoes in the freezer, so used those. Skip the cheese, it is over the top.  Twenty minutes from counter to dinner table. And one table full of happy diners.

I decided that I wanted to challenge my culinary class one day and this was the recipe to picked to do it with.  I spent 4 months in Scotland so I was afraid that they would ruin my fond memories. However I was wrong, and my inner city kids actually did a great job following the recipe and making a dish that brought me back to sitting at the Crags in Edinburgh Scotland.  However there was a couple minor changes I made.  1. I decreased the amount of cinnamon just slightly. 2. added a tablespoon of worchestire (sorry I can never spell this right and there is no spell check) sauce.  With this said it is an easy recipe to follow and produces a great product.

delicious! i adjusted this slightly based on other reviewers comments but i think it's an excellent recipe. i increased the beef to 1.5 lbs, reduced the cinnamon, doubled the "italian seasoning", subbed ketchup for tomato paste, threw in some worchestershire, and made the potatoes like i would make basic mashed. perfect for a cold wintry night - my family loved it!! thank you :)

Having never written a review for anything before. But I was compelled to because this is one of my fravorite dishes of all time and everyone should try this recipe. I made this for christmas dinner and prabably will next year too. Everyone loved it over the traditional turkey or ham dinner. I did take advise from the other reviews and left out the cinnamon also I cooked it in a basic pie crust. MMMMMMMMM GOOD

DH loved this but my kids didn't. I used Worchestershire sauce instead of ketchup and put it all in a pie shell and DH gave me his highest compliment... "you can make that again".

I used a sweet onion and cut cinnamon in half, so the flavor was mild. Probably will go with the full amt next time. Wasn't sure what Italian seasoning meant, so used oregano and basil....could have added a tsp of minced garlic too. Super easy recipe with common ingredients. Thanks!

Another favorite!  I recently traveled to London and had the opportunity to eat cottage pie prepared by a friend.  It inspired me to find a recipe and make it at home.  This is the only one I have tried, but I see no need to look for another one.  Whether it is authentic or not, it is delicious.  The cinnamon blends well with the other spices and gives it a bit of a Mediterranean flavor twist.  I tried less cinnamon once, but missed its flavor, so I went with full strength on all the spices the next time, and liked it best that way.  

I like to microwave the chopped carrots before adding them to the meat mixture so they are soft. One change I made is to add cooked English peas to the meat mixture with the carrots just before baking. I don't care for the taste of canned peas, and mixing it into the pie hides their flavor while giving another texture to the dish, making a nice one pot meal.

One time I tried preparing everything, put it in the baking dish, covering it after it cooled, and refrigerating it.  Then I just had to bake it at meal time.  This was a time saver, but the potatoes were a little dry. I prefer having fresh mashed potatoes on top.

I have served this several times as a one pot meal, and more of it is eaten than expected.  It is not bad as a leftover, reheated in the microwave, but the mashed potatoes sometimes get a bit dried out with storage.

Perfect cold weather meal. I took others suggestions and added peas and worcestershire sauce, and substituted ketchup for the tomato paste just to make it  a little easier. The recipe I read did not call for pie crust. The cinnamon made the flavor in my opinion, a pleasant surprise. I used a 9×13 pan and wished I'd made extra potatoes so that layer was a little thicker on top. I also added extra meat and carrots to make it heartier, and more flour to make it thick.

I've been making this recipe for years. My hints and switches- I always use lean ground beef, and use carrots, onion and parsnips. I skip the cinnamon and use the McCormick Italian Herb spice grinder quite heavily. I use beef stock instead of broth for richer flavor. I also buy a packed of 'simply mashed potatoes' and use those, which cuts back on prep time.

Very good recipe!  I used 1 ½ lbs of ground beef and 5 large potatoes for 4 people and it was almost the perfect amount.   Sautéed garlic and onions before adding the beef and added some Lawry's Garlic Salt along with Celery salt and the Worcestershire sauce and skipped the cinnamon and oregano to keep the flavor more traditional.   Turned out fantastic!

Tasty pie!  My 9 inch pie pan was a little small, so there was a bit of over flow.  Luckily, a cookie sheet caught most of the mess.  I cut in half the amount of butter, and it still tasted great.

Made this tonight, but didn't have tomato paste.  Added garlic powder and cut to 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and my whole family liked it!  Can't wait to try it with all the ingredients:) Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and great comfort food.  I followed other reveiws and left out the cinnamon.  I was worried that the potatoes would be too runny so I didn't use a full cup of milk with I mashed them.  We thought the meat had a very nice flavor.  I would make this again.

It was pretty good.  I made it easy by using instant potatoes, always looking for a way to cut down on time spent in the kitchen.  You will need to spice it up a bit.

Came out too soupy :/ Maybe I didn't let it bake long enough... but I was expecting something a little different than what I received.

SO good.. I halved the recipe (just for the hubby and I) and used a bread pan instead of a pie plate.  The only things I changed were using my normal mashed potato recipe, boiling the carrots before adding to the beef mixture, and adding some frozen peas. I also only put a couple dashes of cinnamon and it complimented the dish nicely.

I thought the Italian seasoning was overpowering and all my husband could taste was the cinnamon.  One cup of milk is WAY too much for the potatoes.  I had hoped for a hearty Sunday dinner, instead we got a big dissapointment and tons of leftovers that no one will want!

This was just ok. It's certainly not an "authentic" tasting Cottage Pie, but it was a flavorful meal, once I tweaked it a little. Worcestershire sauce was a must and I will omit the cinnamon next time. Nutmeg would be more authentic anyway.

Awesome recipe! I didn't use enough potatoes, but will the next time. Make sure that the four potatoes you use are big, if not, use like six. My 12 year old son woke up at midnight to get some water and couldn't resist the smell of this dish, and ate the leftovers I was looking foreward to for my lunch. MOST DEFINATELY A REDO!!!

I cheat. I buy microwaveable mashed potatoes from the fridge section at market. Zap for a few minutes in microwave, stir in a beaten egg, some butter and sour cream and spread over meat mixture and occasionally sprinkle potatoes with grated cheddar. I also use green peas, corn and mushrooms with the meat and gravy mixture. Seldom have leftovers.

This is the best cottage pie I've made to date and I totally credit the sauce/gravy. I've always used a gravy packet or stuff from the jar before this.  I made a few alterations: I only used a small sprinkle of cinnamon and it was plenty (cinnamon has such a strong flavor!) I also used a package of frozen carrots and peas instead of the fresh carrot because peas are essential to my cottage pies! I used ketchup in place of the tomato paste and also added a few good dashes of worcestershire sauce. As for the potatoes I just made them according to my preferences instead of using the recipe. I think I had to cook the beef mixture longer than 15 minutes to reduce it down but it turned out perfectly!  The savory flavor was so delicious and waaaaaay better than any premade sauce/gravy.  I'll be making this again and again.

I make this every year for our St Patty's Day feast. I do not add the cinnamon, use ketchup instead of tomato paste and use a box of frozen peas and carrots. After I put on the mashed potatoes, I sprinkle with cheddar cheese. My family really enjoys this meal.

I did not care for the flavor, all I could taste was the italian seasoning even after I finished the meal. The carrots were raw and I even cooked them longer than recipe called for. The potatoes only needed about 3 Tbsp of milk, not the cup it called for. And I wish I would have put the cheese on the meat and under the potatoes. I won't be cooking this one again.

this recipe calls for too much milk. i cut the milk back to a half cup. it's also a good idea to let the beef mixture and the potaot mixture cool a bit before combining, because the potaot has a tendency to run if added when piping hot. the cinnamon is a measure of taste - i love it, my husband does not.

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made it quite a few times and will be making it again tonight.  I NEVER put it in a pie shell (guess I didnt read the entire recipe ever  lol).  I just throw it in a cassarole dish and put lots of cheese on top.  I also use a bag of frozen mixed vegtables instead of just the carrots.

I make cottagesheppards pie all the time and wanted to be a little different so I tried this recipe. This was good but I had trouble getting the liquid to reduce, I will use less broth next time. My boyfriend, who is English, was not as impressed and asked that I make it the old way again. This recipe made enough that I had to use a 9x13 dish.

I was unclear as to whether to put this in a pie crust or not, since the recipe doesn't call for it, but the description does.  I did use a crust, and it was very good.  This recipe isn't really flavorful, but makes good leftovers.

I substituted garlic & onion powder for the cinnamon & Italian seasoning.  I also used just a little butter & milk when making the mashed potato topping & added a litle garlic powder to the potatoes.  This had a nice flavor.  Some other shepherd's pie-type recipes have been too bland.  I may experiment with adding peas to the beef mixture next time & possibly some Worcestershire sauce as another reviewer suggested.  This was almost overflowing in a 10" pie plate so I may put it in a rectangular glass baking dish next time.

This pie was very good. I know there are many variations to this dish, but I was married to an Englishman and thought this needed a couple of "tweaks". I added some worcestershire sauce and used ketchup instead of tomato sauce.

My husband wanted to give this 6 stars. I agree! This is the best cottage/ Shepherd pie I've ever eaten. I followed the recipe exactly,  and the odd (to me) combination of spices is delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to use a shallow rectangular casserole dish instead of a pie pan. For me, the cheese got dark, but didn't burn. It was gooey under the dark top. When I make it again, I'll add the cheese 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time.

It was a cold day and we were wanting warm comfort food  so I thought I would give this a try and it was a huge hit! I was hoping for leftovers but the pan was empty. I made it just as the recipe called, but my husband thought we should add peas the next time. Will make again, but will make double.

We had some left over garlic mashed potatoes that I needed to use. We used ground turkey added some fresh steam peas and carrotts. I had never had cottage pie before but my husband had asked for it a few months ago so the left over mashed fit his request perfectly.  I baked them in 4 individual  8oz ramekins. He ate 2 for dinner and had the other for lunch the next day.

Wow. This was delicious! I followed the recipe with two exceptions: I added 1/2 cup frozen peas and 1 teaspoon of Henderson's Relish (a Yorkshire specialty). Cooked everything in a cast iron pan and let it simmer until it was nice and thick, then topped it with mashed potatoes and grated Cabot's Extra Sharp Cheddar. Normally we don't like cinnamon in our beef dishes but after everything simmered the flavors of the seasonings mellowed and it wasn't cinnamony at all, just incredible tasty.

This was a good base, but pretty bland, so I made some changes... for one thing I don't have "Italian seasoning," so I added 1 teas each of oregano, basil and thyme. I also doubled the cinnamon, added a heaping tablespoon of garlic powder, a heaping teaspoon of paprika and a teaspoon of cayenne. I added some fresh corn and frozen peas to the meat at the last minute as well. I sort of wished I had doubled the tomato paste, and also, maybe added a generous dash of Worcestershire sauce. 
I used baby potatoes, with the skin on, for the topping, and used cream instead of milk. I generously salted and peppered them, and used the Kitchen Aide mixer with the whisk to mash them - so they were really fluffy and light. so super easy to put on top of the meat. And of course, I topped with LOTS of extra sharp cheddar. I covered the whole thing with foil, and baked at 300 for about 40 mins, then took off the foil and baked for another 20 mins. After all my changes, I'd give it a 5!

It's a very good quick meal & very filling. I would give it 5 stars but I made some small changes so a 4+ is my rate. I left out the cinnamon , added a few splashes of Worcestershire & a little garlic powder with the other listed spices . I did use parsley flakes not fresh. It all came together real flavorful. I did not use fresh carrots in my meat, I made the meat mix then just  added 1/2 can each of  sliced carrots & half a can of pea's. I didn't have a can of mixed peas & carrots or that is what I would have used instead of opening 2 cans of veggies. I made my mash potatoes & piled them on top of the meat, topped it off with shredded cheese & baked it until cheese melted. It came out wonderful. I cooked the meat mix in a cast Iron skillet & didn't need to transfer into a baking dish just popped it in the oven. It was so simple & tastes great! I will make this again many times & serve with warm bread, yeast rolls or even biscuits. so good just great for fall & winter comfort foods.

I made this and followed the recipe and included the cinnamon.  I did not notice a strong aftertaste.  I found this meal to be delicious.  My husband loved it and raved about it.  I stayed to the basics of this recipe but added the vegetables I had on hand.  This was green beans and zucchini.  I found that the addition of flour was essential for this nice gravy mixture.  You can play around with this recipe too...as I have seen some reviewers do this with the soup or vegetables.  I tried it with Golden mushroom soup.  It was excellent and it wasn't soupy at all.  I am glad that I followed the reviews and used a deeper dish.  It does bubble up and get a lot more liquid than I put into the recipe.  I found the amount of broth on the recipe to be great.  I also subbed ketchup for tomato paste and added Worchestershire sauce per other reviews.  I found that after I tasted the mixture, I had to add a lot of seasoning to get a good flavor.  I also found that more salt is needed despite some reviews to the contrary.  I found that seasoning the potatoes was essential to good flavor and adding crushed red pepper to add a nice kick...will keep this as a go to recipe!

I would give this 3.5 stars, but my husband gives it 3.   The cinnamon was very prominent in this dish. After reading the reviews, I cut the cinnamon by a tiny bit.  I wanted to try it with the cinnamon because I know there is cinnamon in Cincinnati chili, and we love that meal!  I would like to try this again, but with maybe only 1/8 tsp cinnamon or none at all.

I've made a good many "Shepherds Pie" type recipes (I love 'em), to mixed reviews from the "Boss". This recipe rated a rave review from family and friends. Made this as written and don't plan too much tweaking in the future. So rich and "comforting".
A salad and a good "Red" completes the meal. Really easy, and fun, and delicious! Thanks Caroline, for sharing.

I tried this last night, made some changes though.

My mince meat was a mix of pork and beef. I switched the Italian dressing to some garlic and dried oregano and then added Worcester sauce. Finally I added frozen peas and sweet corn to the mix.  

The result was amazing, couldn't get enough!

A very good recipe, I made a few modifications (first is the removal of the cinnamon, it doesn't belong in this recipe), I also doubled it and made it in a 13x9 pan.  I also added some garlic powder (both to the meat mixture as well as to the mashed potatoes) and added 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms.  It was well received by everyone...

I just joined allrecipes and decided to try the Proper English Cottage Pie.  My mother used to make cottage pie often and I always loved it.  I made this recipe for my kids because it was close to hers.  We all absolutely loved it!  It's very important to make sure that most of the liquid is cooked out of the meat mixture before assembly, otherwise you have a mess.  Don't skimp on the cheese, it will make the mash stiff enough to keep shape when served.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of the filling was exceptional, IMO. The cinnamon added depth to the flavoring. I like creamier potatoes so I added whipping cream instead of milk. I was amazed at how easy this was to make, as well as how quick.

This is a lovely adaptable recipe that can incorporate ingredients one may have on hand.  Today, I had a large piece of roast beef to use so I tried it in this recipe.  I also added frozen peas to add to the veggie content and some cubes of frozen garlic scapes (because we grow garlic)!  The suggested spicing was perfect for us - spicing, of course, should be to one's individual taste... With ground beef, this recipe will take me back to holidays in Britain when we had cottage pie in pubs quite a bit!  This is a lovely dish and I will be making it again.  Like so many good recipes, the results will always be different - depending on what we have...  Thanks for this.

As written this recipe would not work for me because I did as other reviewers and had a decent 'pie'.  Still something is missing for flavor and the meat came out tough.  
Well, one day I had left over meatloaf.  I crumbled it up, did the recipe--with the changes suggested-- all over again and it was fabulous.  The meat was tender and held together when I cut into the flavorful pie.

Excellent recipe. I think it could do with a touch of sweetness (peas or corn), but otherwise excellent. The herbs really brought out the flavour.

Incredible Recipe! Due to some missing ingredients I had to make a few changes..

1. I used 85/15 Ground Turkey instead of Ground Beef.
2. I used cornstarch/water mixture instead of flour.
3. I used a little less beef broth with some tomato ketchup instead of the tomato paste.
4. I added a little of some fresh thyme.
5. I used fresh grated Asiago, which was concealed in the potato color on top, instead of shredded cheddar. 
6. I added some garlic powder to the potato mixture. 

This was delicious, will definitely make again!

I tweaked this recipe to my own tastes (I hardly ever follow any recipe exactly).  I added a little more cinnamon than the recipe calls for and it wasn't overpowering at all.  I also added some hot madras curry powder, cumin, garlic powder, worcestershire sauce, 2T extra tom. paste, and red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  

Like some have suggested, just make the mashed potatoes the way you like them.  It's not necessary to follow the recipe's measurements or methods.  I tweaked the mashed potatoes by adding crumbled bacon and cheddar cheese to mine.  

I doubled the entire recipe and filled two 9x9 deep dish store-bought pie crusts.  I didn't realize at the time that the crusts were lightly sweetened, but they actually enhanced the overall character of the dish, giving it a delicately sweet, very savory flavor with a nice kick. 

While my end product may not be considered "proper" by cottage pie purists, it was definitely fantastic and will become a regular on my dinner table.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for some British friends and they loved it.  However, I did the Shepherd pie version using ground lamb instead of beef.  Also, added garlic, Worcestershire sauce and brown gravy mix instead of flour.  Cooked the carrots and onions the entire time while browning meat.  Served with balsamic caramelized carrots.  This was excellent meal!

Delish!  I made it without the parsley, and instead of the 3 carrots I used 3/4 bag of frozen diced carrots with peas.  I also made it in smaller individual casserole dishes so there wasn't as large a pile of potatoes on top and we had our own container - kept it nice and hot all the way through.  I highly recommend this - and definitely use sharp cheddar cheese on top.  YUM!

Really very good.  I was impressed with the gravy it made.  I would probably go a little lighter on the Italian seasoning, but that is a personal preference.  We enjoyed it!

I have family in England, and this reminds me of their Cottage pie! I have made this dozens of times now. I often buy the microwaveable mashed potatoes to save time. I also often add parsnips, but you can really add ANY veg you have on hand. The only real mod I've made is to use just a PINCH of cinnamon, or you can go without it. I also make a nice beef gravy to pour over it. This is a favorite I come back to over and over again!

Brilliant!  I prepared this for my British husband with a few alterations, and he *really* enjoyed it!   I reduced the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp, and next time I'll use even less.  I also used less cheese since we're trying to lighten things up around here.  And, because we didn't have ground beef, I used ground Bison - let me tell you... it was AMAZING!  Great recipe!

I'm British and I LOVE this recipe. Most of the time I use slightly less cheese to because I like the texture of the straight potato browned on top. So long as you use fresh ingredients, it is wonderful to enjoy the taste of the carrots and mashed potato and beef mixture. Often I don't have tomato paste on hand and have used some kind of tomato sauce instead.

I'm staying with my folks while building a house, they have NOTHING for seasoning in their cupboards, I couldn't believe it.  Anyway, I didn't have an onion, Italian seasoning, or parsley,  I chose to omit the cinnamon.  I used a bag of mixed veggies, and sad to say ketchup instead of tomoto paste.  I used minced garlic in my meat mixture and some worchestire sauce(no salt and pepper).  I made the potatos the way I always do, and used much more cheese.  I was very pleasently surprised at how tasty this was, even without all the ingrediants.  I will try this again.

This is good. I used ketchup instead of the tomato paste and I made my mashed potatoes the way I normally do, other than that I followed the recipe to the tee. I will likely make it again even thought my kids still like lambs meat rather than ground beef.

The great thing about cottage pie and shepards pies is they are so versatile.  I'm Irish and I grew up eating these types of food.  My husband even like it and he's cajun.  Now that I tried the recipe I might tweek it a little next time.  Going to save it in my favorites.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very good but a little bland.  With the addition of some garlic and a few other seasonings, it will definately be a 5 star recipe.  The perfect meal for a cold winter day.

This is great!! A bigger pie plate would be helpful (I even used a 9.5 inch one). My stove got a little spattered. I didn't have Italian seasoning, so like another reviewer, I used some generous shakes of garlic powder, basil and oregano. I used 1 tbsp dried parsley instead of fresh, 1 tsp beef bouilion with one cup water instead of the beef broth, and 1 tbsp ketchup instead of the tomato paste. I used 1 cup of milk in the potatoes, as directed, which made them very runny going into the oven. However, after 25 minutes baking, they were great!! I also sauteed and simmered the beef mixture for a lot longer than the directions indicated--I was trying to make dinner and get my 15 month old to eat something at the same time--it makes everything take longer. So... great dish! It's a keeper.

This is a good recipe. You can purchase tomato paste in a tube that you keep in the fridge, so when a TB is called for, simply squeeze out that amount, and save the remaining tube.  Simple.

My husband was BEGGING for some Cottage Pie and this is now his favorite thing that I make (he actually said that!). The only changes I made to the meat mixture were to use ground Turkey instead of beef (being easy on the wasitline), substitute Thyme, Rosemary, Oregano, and Basil on their own rather than in the form of "Italian seasoning" (1/2 tsp of  each and it was the perfect amount), and added 1/2 cup of frozen (or you could use fresh) peas.  I used skin-on red potatoes and added a little fresh chopped garlic during the whipping process. Other than that I followed the recipe as written, and it was absolutely divine ;) My British friends were even impressed!

Good Basic recipe.  I added my own touches - decreased the cinnamon, added peas and substituted 1/4 of the beef broth with 1/4 cup of Guiness.  Family loved it.

Delicious! So many ground beef casseroles are blah to me. I wasn't sure about how the cinnamon would be but it added a really nice dimension, while the stock is key for a nice rich flavor. I added a splash of Worchestershire to boot, and tripled the recipe in order to freeze two pie plates for later use.   My picky preschoolers gobbled it up and I thought it was really yummy too.

I really liked this and I personally felt it needed more spice... but my husband loved it (and he is a Brit with aversion to black pepper). I used Bisto instead of beef broth - which thickened it perfectly and they freeze really well.

Have made cottage pie from other recipes before and thought I'd try a new recipe this time.  I should have stuck with the one I usually use as this was rather bland.  Edible, but bland.  My kids thought the same but then they've been spoilt with the real English dish having lived there most of their lives.

I think this recipe is wonderful.  Like others noted, you do need a large baking dish.  You can adjust any seasonings to your taste, along with the added veggies, just play with it to find something you love.

This is awesome!  My husband loved it and even my too picky 5-year-old daughter ate it!  Definitely NO leftover even if I doubled the recipe!  However, I made some twists here and there (as I always do with other recipes). Added some garlic, celery, and diced potatoes.  Then also added  basil,oregano, parsley  and a little more of the italian seasoning.  I used a spaghetti Tomato sauce with Basil (leftover) instead of opening a new can of tomato paste.    For the mashed potato, I let the water boiled and dissolved a cube of beef broth, then added the potatoes.  It definitely gave some taste.  Thank you so much! Will make this more often!

My boyfriend and I made this with his mom for a group of friends that we do dinner with every Sunday, we all take turns but this is one of the best recipes we've used.  This last time we made it I added a pie crust and more seasoning to the meat.  We also can't use cinnamon bc of an allergy so we substituted it with nutmeg.  AMAZING flavor.

Really good recipe with changes. I've substituted leftover cubed turkey/chicken for the beef. Omit cinnamon, parsley ...like others have said.Instead I've used 1 to 1.5 cups of tomato/spaghetti sauce and a dash of worcester sauce and lessened the beef broth to 1 cup for a thicker sauce without using the flour. Other times I've used leftover gravy for all/part of the sauce. Be sure to put a hole in the middle of the mashed potatoes so sauce/gravy won't spill over sides of dish!

Amazing recipe---the cinnamon gives this dish an "authentic" taste.  After the ground beef and onion was almost cooked through, I added the cinnamon and herbs to the meat and sauted until cooked.  This allowed the spices to blend with the meat a little more.  Then I added the flour and proceeded as written. Great recipe, will make it again and again.

The cinnamon definitely needs to be in there. When we made it you could smell that cinnamon, but when you ate it, it was just yumminess. Depending on how much extra onion/carrots you add, you may need larger than a pie plate, but ours fit perfectly into our nine inch pan. A great meal.

This is like a shepherd's pie, though I thought it was a little better.  As recommended by others, I substituted ketchup for the tomato paste, added 1 TBLS. of Worch. sauce, decreased the milk to half a cup and decrease the cinnamon to a quarter tsp.  I also added corn on top of the meat and flavored the meat with a few TBLS. of minced garlic.  I substituted one of the potatoes for a parsnip..you couldn't tell the difference.

This is the first cottage/shepherd pie my husband didn't add ketchup to!  It was yummy.  Don't omit the cinnamon.  Next time I will grate the carrots as they were a bit underdone.  More salt is required than recipe calls for - I added garlic salt.  Just keep tasting it til you like it. Add more beef broth if you like a moister one.  This is a keeper!

My family enjoyed this recipe and it is definitely a keeper, with a few revisions. The cinnamon need scaled back a bit, probably in half. Secondly, I thought 1 cup of milk was way too much, so I only dumped in 3/4 c. and right away regretted it. I would recommend eye balling the milk starting with 1/4 c. My potatoes were rather runny but we went with it and it turned out okay. The finally issue I had was either needing to use less liquid or cook the meat longer as that was rather runny also. Unfortunately the extra liquid over flowed and filled my kitchen with smoke. Good recipe overall.

This recipe gave me the nerve to make a dish I would otherwize only order in a restaurant.

I simmered in a bovril, water, white wine mix, which seemed key to turning the beef into expected pie texture. Used ketchup rather than open a tin of tomato paste.  Simmering also cooked the veggies. I added my fav spices of worcheshire, garlic, seasoning salt and marjoram.

When serving, I topped with Knorr's brown gravy.  Husband and I loved it.

I loved this recipe!  I exercised a little artistic freedom, but basically followed the recipe as it was.  I did cut the cinnamon in half, just because I was nervous about it, having read the other reviews.  I added some extra seasonings, including garlic and Greek seasoning, rather than just salt and pepper, and added peas.  It was very flavorful.  Texture was great, just had to make sure to simmer it down as instructed.  I did not use a pie crust, but it would probably be just as good with one.  I also used my own mashed potato recipe.  My husband loved it, 12-yr-old son liked it, 6-yr-old daughter thought it was "different, but good", and my 2-yr-old daughter inhaled every morsel.  I will make this again and try different variations to find one that everyone in my house can really enjoy.  (Not an easy task!)  Thank you!

Not bad, but I think it was missing something.. more flavour?  Not quite sure, but I'd play with it a bit more.  But good base recipe, and build from there

Very Good!  I added seasoning to my own taste, as you usually need to do with any recipe.  Added Worst. sauce to meat mixture; used 1-1/4 beef broth and 1/4 cup of burgundy wine.  Made my own mashed potatoes with sour cream and garlic.  I LOVE the cinnamon and usually add it to any meat recipe.  I did use a pie crust (frozen) that I first put in oven for about 8 minutes.  I'll be making this one constantly, it's a standout!

I REALLY enjoyed this dish.  My kids were not sure whether they liked it or not.  They pretty much ate all they took but I think the cinnamon was what made them unsure.  My DH said it was "different" and ate a heaping helping.  Thank you for spicing up our life! lol

Good recipe.  Like others, I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce and about 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  I also found that I only needed half the quantity of milk specified for the mashed potatoes.
A great dish for a pot luck!

Delicious comfort food, my family loved it. The only change I made to the recipe was I always add garlic to my mashed potatoes and I poured the beef mixture into a pie crust. It's one of our family favorites now.

Was a hit with my family and this would NOT fit in a standard size pie pan I used a 9x9 pan. I used ground turkey and I did omit the cinnamon and added rosemary and garlic in addition to the parsley, salt and pepper. Super glad I came across this. It's definitely a good recipe to use up staple pantry items.

I'm torn between a 1 & a 2 star review, because while the 2 adults "could" eat it (and did), the kids could not. Additionally, the leftovers will be discarded, because the adults don't *want* to eat any more of it. I will say that the potatoes were good; although I needed only half a cup of milk. Sadly, the cinnamon is what overpowered this for my family. Thank you for the recipe, though, Caroline! I appreciate your submission, even though it wasn't a 'keeper' for me. Obviously, many love it!

I’m English and everything was ok except for the cinnamon.Please don’t add cinnamon to traditional cottage pie.
Add some Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. Don’t whip the potatoes, they don’t need to be smooth, chunkier is better.

I added a bit of garlic powder and greens peas. (I thought it needed some color.)
It is important to make sure that the potatoes are not too soft. 
Was delicious and went over well for my English lineage family. They loved it.

I just returned from a 5 week trip to Europe which included Ireland, Scotland, and England, and fell in love with cottage pie. While there are many variations of this dish, this recipe came closest to my favorite. I did add a tiny bit of Worcestershire sauce and used ketchup instead of paste, and my own mashed potatoes recipe. I DID use the cinnamon and I have to tell you, I think it IS the secret ingredient- adding a depth to the meat that is exactly what I love about cottage pie.

Loved it. I didn’t have Italian seasoning, but I did have fresh rosemary, thyme and oregano which were fabulous as a substitute. I also didn’t have tomato paste, so I put in a smaller quantity of ketchup (probably didn’t make much difference) and increased the flour to 3 tablespoons. Aaaand I used ground venison, which is fabulous in this dish. If I have any on hand next time, I might pour a splash of red wine into the sauce before simmering. But honestly this was perfectly lovely as-is.

Will definitely make this again.  I made it exactly as written except for the tomato paste.  I didn't have any, so I used 1/4 cup ketchup instead.  The cinnamon sounded like a strange ingredient, but hey---I'm not British and have never made a "Proper Cottage Pie", so I put it in.  Hubby loved it.  Will definitely make again and possibly add some frozen green peas to the pie before baking.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was my first attempt at cottage pie and the flavor was very good. My main change was that I used ground venison instead of beef (hunter’s pie?), and that worked really nicely. I used both ketchup and Worcestershire Sauce, but I also opted for a bit of cinnamon. I can see why one might want to leave that out, though. I was most impressed with the “juiciness” of the filling...I don’t like cottage pies that are too dry!

My husband and I loved this; it's a perfect winter comfort food. I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I'd make next time is to double the mashed potatoes, as I only got a thin layer of potatoes on top following the recipe amounts.

This was very good but I would halve or omit the cinnamon next time. It is not bad with it, but I think we would prefer it without. Thanks!

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe because after seasoning -- and adding some garlic powder to boost the flavor -- I was skeptical because it tasted bland.  But after topping with potatoes and baking, it was really great tasting.  Followed several reviewers' advice and used ketchup instead of tomato paste, cut back the amount of cinnamon and the Italian seasoning, and added about a cup and a half of frozen peas to the meat mixture.  A great recipe for a cold winter dinner. Comfort food at its finest.  You could pile just about anything into the meat to change it up, too.  Parsnip instead of/in addition to carrots, broccoli, chopped tomatoes, you name it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for my daughter and her family. She has many diet restrictions but this worked.  I substituted arrowroot for the flour making it gluten free. Sweet potatoes were substituted on part of the dish for the mashed potatoes. The whole family loved it including 6 and 12 year olds.

Just not my taste. Cinnamon is noticable and distracts from the rest of the dish. Perhaps the New Orleans pallete is just too different from English pallete. In my opinion, not worth trying to doctor this recipe to meet my tastes.

The taste is wonderful but it turned out a bit soupy. I would suggest getting rid of some of the fat from the cooked meat and definitely make this with four very large potatoes. But the taste is great. I will definitely make this again.

Really enjoyed this. Made it as the recipe stated with the exception of cutting the cinnamon down to 1/4 tsp as well as the addition of 2 tbsp of Worcestershire to the ground beef. We will definitely make this again, thank you for sharing.

Great dish for something different and easy. Husband liked it which is huge. I eat a mainly Paleo diet and some ingredients not compliant but I will make it occasionally.

This is simply the best version of cottage pie / shepherd's pie I've ever eaten. the cinnamon as a real unexpected depth of flavor that is a hit every time. Well it's absolutely perfect as written it's also easy to add your own twists. I've used lamb, beef, turkey, or tomatoes, green beans, asparagus. You could probably add an old sneaker and it would still be just as delicious!

This recipe is pretty great.  I made some preferential additions:
- boiled potatoes with a couple cloves of crushed garlic
- I didn’t add Italian seasoning (didn’t have any) and only did 1 tbsp of parsley flakes
- cooked 3 diced cloves of garlic to meat mixture (along with 1 large carrot, 1 onion, and some sweet peas)
- Added wort. Sauce, ketchup (instead of the purée), and a dash of soy sauce to the meat.
- Added 3 tbsp of  bisto to the broth
- Added 1/3 block of cream cheese to mashed potatoes

This was delicious! Made the following changes: Replaced stock+flour with gravy mix+water. Just tossed in a bag of frozen peas and carrots instead of dicing carrots, which was perfect except it needed longer to bake since the carrots and peas were frozen.

I made this but substituted for Ground Bison, frozen peas and carrots and I used heavy cream for the mash. It turned out good. I’m giving this 4?? because of the cinnamon. It was a little bit overpowering. I would use less or none at all in the future. Otherwise tasted pretty good.

Almost perfect...I wanted to surprise my British husband with this home cooked meal and he said it tasted strange...it was the cinnamon...you don’t put cinnamon in a traditional cottage pie! I would make again without the cinnamon and maybe add a dash of worchestershire sauce.

Instead of ground beef, used a big piece of leftover eye round roast.    To  deal with the guilt of the "comfort food" label, I added a finely diced zucchini with the onions.
The cinnamon  was a nice touch.

I've made this a few times now. Tonight included. It's a wonderful meal and a family favorite. My only change is that we prefer to omit the cinnamon. Although it isn't bad with it included, it tasted sweeter more than savory. Savory is what my family prefers. We also added garlic, because we would be garlic if we had our way haha

I made this with my wife, and it turned out great.  Not a vegetable lover, so I left out the carrots.  Also left out the cinnamon as many recommended and added Worcestershire sauce.  Added the cheese on top when 10 minutes left to bake.

Excellent recipe! Really yummy. Husband loved it. To people concerned about the Italian seasoning - all the flavors meld beautifully. You don’t go “Hey - that’s Italian”. Just a wonderful flavor and aroma with the barest hint of cinnamon, which is as it should be. Fabulous taste, very clear instructions - excellent recipe. Thank you very much!

This is such an easy recipe.  I did do two changes - used Better than Bouillon Beef base because it is low sodium and has no MSG and will not put me in the hospital; and I added 1 Tablespoon of Minced Garlic.  I also used the other reviewers Worcestershire sauce recommendation.  Make a pie crust on this?  No way because them it becomes a Welch Pastie and not a Cottage pie.  I did nix on the cinnamon however.  Other than that  wonderful comfort food.  Oh - and I chopped the recipe in half cause there is only me to cook for.

We love cottage pie and gave this 4 as I made some small changes. Reduced cinnamon by half and added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I didn’t have Italian herbs so used herbs de Provence.  I also added a clove of garlic, 1/2 tsp Worcester Sauce and frozen peas. We especially enjoy this comfort food during the winter months.

Per other suggestions, I added Worcester sauce & garlic. It still was a bit bland. I'm going to make it again & up the flavor of the meat. I didn't add the cinnamon. A medium diced onion is a lot in a pound of hamburger. I added a small bag of frozen peas & carrots in place of the 3 carrots called for and used instant potatoes on the top as we were in a hurry.

I made it as specified. Unlike many of the reviewers we enjoyed the cinnamon. The problem I had with the recipe was it was too runny. Next time I won’t add any beef broth, I’ll just add the paste.

I added 1 cup of frozen peas at the same time the broth mixture was added. Also, because baby-cut carrots were on sale, I added carrots by weight, adding 1/2 lb. The pan size suggestion is completely off, based on my results. I used a 2qt casserole and didn't fit all the potatoes. Next time I will use a wider, shallower dish. Also, the cinnamon is a bit of a heavy touch, I plan to halve it and add some Worcestershire sauce.

Very Good! I omitted the cinnamon  and added frozen peas and some worcestershire sauce, as suggested by other reviewers. Made my own mashed potatoes and topped with that and just a little cheese. I doubled the filling  recipe and froze some for a quick meal at a later date. Very good! Thanks!

Thanks to some previous reviewers' suggestions, I made the following tweaks to this recipe: Added worcestershire, plenty of garlic, and quite a bit of salt to the meat. I also added a couple of handfuls of peas and omitted the cinnamon. I used sweet potatoes and only had two of them, but I thought that was enough. I wish I had listened to the reviewer who had suggested using a 9x13 instead of the pie plate. Mine was running over, even after cutting the potatoes in half. However, this turned out delicious! I would love to make this again.

This is my favorite cottage pie, and one of my all time favorite winter recipes. It's great as leftovers as well. The cinnamon is subtle and warm and I think a very English touch. If it seems strange, try looking up recipes for homemade ketchup. Anyway, YUM.

Really, really delicious. So glad I? found this recipe. Besides using Trader Joe’s frozen mashed potatoes, I? didn’t change a thing and it was perfect! The flavors went really well together and made my house smell SO good!

This was a big hit at my house. As others suggested, I did not add as much cinnamon and it was perfectly seasoned. My mashed potatoes were too soft, so next time I would change that, but otherwise, it will be in my kitchen in the future.

I love this recipe, it's so easy to change up according to what you have in the pantry.  I used red potatoes for the mashers, and tomato sauce rather than paste, some garlic powder and rosemary since I didn't have italian seasoning, frozen carrots and peas.  It's delicious!

This was great! After reading reviews, I added peas, left out the cinnamon, and added Worcestershire sauce. I think the cinnamon would have been good, now that I've tasted it, and I may try it next time. I made the mashed potatoes just as I normally do. It tasted great! It did spill out of my pie dish a bit so next time I may use a 9x13. This recipe is a keeper.

Added frozen peas, diced mushrooms, ketchup instead of tomato paste, 1/2 jar of chicken gravy...whatever I had in the frigerator! Think of it as a stew under mashed potatoes. Delicious!

Made it almost exactly as written. One change I made was to halve the cinnamon. While I could taste that small amount of cinnamon, no one else could. For me 1/4 tsp of cinnamon was very subtle but definitely there. Next time I may omit the cinnamon. Second change was I added frozen peas, just before I put it in the oven. Last change was the addition of Worcestershire, like others noted this addition is crucial. Everyone had two or three helpings. Will add to my rotation. Total comfort food.

If I make this again, I'll cut way down on the amount of milk in the potatoes. The amount in the recipe is way too much and turned my potatoes into soup. And though others have written that the cinnamon isn't really authentic or needed, we enjoyed it in the recipe.

My husband (whose mother is British) loved this recipe. I omitted the cinnamon and added 1-1/2 cups of peas between the meat and potatoes layers.  It took simmering longer than 15 minutes for most of liquid to get absorbed.

I've made this cottage pie recipe dozens of times.  My husband and I love it just as it is.  The only thing I don't do is add extra salt.  I feel with the beef broth it's salty enough.  I do add frozen corn to the beef just before it goes into the oven.  I skip the carrots as a way to save time.

I've learned to read some reviews before trying a recipe for ideas on how to make it better to my taste.  I'm not crazy about cinnamon on meat but I did sprinkle just a bit.. the required amount would be just too much for my preference. I sautéed the onions and carrots a little before adding fresh garlic then added meat.. delicious. Also used ketchup instead of  opening and wasting my tomato paste.  Added 2 oz of cream cheese to the potatoes and yumm.. I will say leftovers the next day for some reason tasted even better! But missed some type of hard texture.. next time maybe with some dinner rolls or garlic bread.. but great comfort food.

Not very good. The cinnamon is not at all appealing, there is no reason to cook the beef to death in the skillet, and I can't help thinking  quarter pound of cheese is a typo and should have been a quarter cup. Greasy and unappealing.

This is a great recipe, and an easy way to use 1lb of beef to make a one pot meal. I added the peas on the side and found this to be very satisfying.

11.09.16 ~ Wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this, although I knew my DH would. I did enjoy it, a lot! I made this as written and split it between two pans. I like that I could make this up in the morning and popped it in the oven when I got home. That made it a great weeknight meal and the leftovers were wonderful. Served it with fresh corn and cottage cheese. I will be making this one again!

This one satisfied the picky eaters!  The cinnamon and Italian seasoning is amazing together.  I'm already getting requests to make it again:) 
Next time I think I would add a little garlic and maybe diced bell pepper or another vegetable in with the meat.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe except for adding a few more vegetables.  It was delicious, so the next time I added even more vegetables (I've added peas, parsnips, rutabaga, zucchini, cauliflower; basically whatever I had on hand) and doubled the meat.  I added a can of Guinness to the sauce (and upped the seasonings to taste) and doubled the mashed potatoes, too, and made two pies.  I would recommend not using a pie plate but rather a round casserole dish to hold it all in. This is one of my favorite comfort foods to make.  So yummy!

Would definitely make again. Used recipe as a guide but did add peas and Worcestershire as suggested by others. Cinnamon gave it a nice authentic flavor. Husband said it was the best Cottage Pie he has ever had and he's tried a few at a pub or two.

I suggest, once you have your mashed potatoes prepared, that you gently fold the shredded cheese into the potatoes rather than sprinkle on top. Also, use a good brand of cheese, that will cut down on the oil.

This is delicious ! I loved the blend of seasonings. My husband who grew up in England always enjoys when I make dishes that he grew up eating. I made one mistake tho I forgot the cheese which is unusual for me because I tend to add cheese to almost everything. There is always next time!

I made the recipe exactly as written (including the cinnamon). It was quite good, but I found it was missing something, so I added some worcestershire sauce, and that kicked it up a notch. With that one addition, it was absolutely delicious!! To these so-called 'English' reviewers, when did cottage pie ever have a pie crust? You people need to learn to read.

I did not have Italian spice so I used a combination of spices from the spice rack. I added a little more tomato paste than the original recipe called for and put a layer of corn between the meat and the potato. The cheese came out as a beautiful golden crust. Seconds all around.

Very good and easy and I would give 5 stars but I altered as follows: did not use cinnamon, added chopped Italian Parsley (had alot I needed to use), added 1tsp Herb de Provence seasoning (no Italian) and a few shakes of dried Thyme, baked in the 12" Cast Iron skillet I made it in after topping with potatoes and cheese. A keeper!

just made this exactly as written and my husband and I agree that omitting or going way lighter on the cinnamon would make this irresistible. I will omit it this next time and add a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  I will definitely make this again! this truly was great comfort food! I can easily see feeding this to a crowd!

This was really good.  I wasn't sure about the cinnamon but it added a nice flavor.  Definitely wouldn't omit it!  I did make a couple of changes.  I doubled the recipe and only had one lb. ground beef so I added some ground  bison I had. I also added corn and peas.  I know it's not in a traditional cottage pie but I always think it's good to sneak in extra veggies. We made this for company and everyone had seconds.  Planning on making it again this week!

I was craving a vegan cottage pie that was similar to the real thing, and decided to customize this recipe, and it worked a treat! The whole thing disappeared- everyone had seconds. I used shallots as I had no onions, I used "Beyond Beef" instead of ground beef, and I used sweet potatoes with almond milk instead of white potatoes. I also added grated carrots and corn (didn't have peas), and used veggie broth instead of beef. I also omitted the cheese. It was so good! It wasn't my English mother-in-law's cottage pie, but hubby loved it nonetheless. :) I may try making it for the in-laws when we go to England. But I'll use peas instead of corn.

This recipe worked well for me almost exactly as written. As per other reviewers' suggestions, I added 2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 cup of peas and corn. I had such faith that this recipe was going to work out well I doubled the recipe to have one pie to freeze. Next time I make it I will likely reduce the amount of beef broth by about 1/3 to make it less sloppy. 
This recipe was a winner with my friends and family. It's easy and I will definitely make it again!

Really great!  I doubled the recipe and added half teaspoon of Worchestire sauce plus half teaspoon of Nutmeg, left out the cinnamon.  My grandmother always put a dash of nutmeg in ground beef.   I used 2 tablespoons of tomato paste too.  People... you can open a can, use what you need, and freeze the remainder in little luncheon bags by the spoon full, so handy!

I am not a fan of this recipe.  The cinnamon and Italian seasoning made for a very weird flavor combination.  Unfortunately we just did not care for this at all.

I cheated and made this out of left over crock pot beef chuck roast, onions,carrots, and gravy made from the beef stock. It already had garlic cloves so just put in a bit of Italian seasoning (you can buy in a jar) and some of my tomato paste in the tube in my fridge. I ignored the cinnamon. Threw on some frozen peas and a bit of parsley, baked at 350 for 30 min. Then I added instant mashed potatoes on top, baked another 20 min at 400 then put the cheese on top the last 10 min. ! Good way to use leftovers! Thanks!

I did make some minor changes to the recipe, I didn't add the cinnamon as I'm not a fan anyway, and I added some extra garlic too, would of been really nice except the flour seemed to make the mince meat really stodgy which let it down slightly. Won't be adding the flour next time as I made a second meal without the flour and it was much better. :)

Really good--I used corn instead of carrots, but didn't mix in with the beef mixture.  Instead, layered the beef mixture, then a layer of corn kernels, then topped with the mashed potatoes.  (Just accommodating picky eaters, not because I thought the recipe needed altering.)  Did add Worcestershire, though, since that brings another element of flavor to the beef.  I like Caroline C's suggestion of using gravy granules, and will try to give the beef layer a little more of a gravy component next time I make this.

I tried this recipe and served it at a luncheon for 8 today. Very well received and absolutely delicious! I liked the idea that I could prepare it yesterday and bake it today.I added cooked (from frozen) peas to this to add the vegetable quota and served it with pickled beets. Since it was all done a day in advance, all I had to do was pop it in the oven. That way I could enjoy my guests.

This recipe is a pretty good guide. I put my own spin on it by using just a dash of cinnamon and subbing out the parsley with Rosemary, gives is a great flavor! I also include minced garlic in with the onions and also add corn and green beans when I add the broth to give it extra veggie goodness.  I also omit the cheese as it seems to just be overkill.

Great recipe....I made this for the first time after falling in love with a Cottage Pie that I had at an irish pub.  This is really very close to that dish, but a little more flavorful if you do follow a few of the tips.  Use a little worst. sauce in the beef broth, and skip the tomato paste...just use a little ketchup instead and it's perfect.  I loved the cinnamon and didn't find it overwhelming at all. YUM!

Excellent for St. Patrick's Day! I made a larger serving - more than doubled it - and put it in a 9x13 pan. Added minced garlic to the beef and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce to the broth. Used ketchup in lieu of tomato paste. Didn't have Italian seasoning so added few pinches of dried rosemary and thyme to the broth and let it sit a bit to release the flavor. I added frozen peas and carrots to the beef [after cooking] instead of dicing carrots. I paid no attention to the mashed potato instructions - just made a big batch of my regular mashed potato's and spread them on top of the beef mixture. 

Good thing I made a huge batch as my 19 yr. old son had THREE big servings. Yep, it was a hit and I'll make it again!

Excellent, though I use more carrots and double the potatoes (it may be that the potatoes I can buy are small).  I also double the cinnamon, and have been known to put green peas in it.  An excellent, simple and hardy meal.

I have very successfully made a vegetarian version of this recipe using veggie crumbles and vegetable broth for the beef and beef broth. It was very good.

This was so good!  I didn't use the cinnamon and like others used Ketchup instead of tomato paste.  My kids devoured it and asked that I make it again next week.  My only suggestion is to make a double batch because mine was gone the next day!!

I made this for a family Christmas party and it was well received by all. I didn't add the cut up potatoes because of the potatoes on top. I did add a large can of green beans, peas and corn though to add to the amount per serving. I also added some Savory for an added flavor.

The 13 year old loved it.  Didn't use the crust, but can see a need for it with the saucy meat.  The small pieces of carrots cooked through, but threw the texture off for me.

Really enjoy this recipe. make it often. I add some corn and peas too. Only criticism is that when I serve it on the plate, it doesn't really hold its form.

I haven't made cottage pie in years so had to find a recipe to remind me of the ingredients.  Found this recipe and it was DELICIOUS!!!  My hubby and I enjoyed it so much.  I made some minor changes after reading the reviews (and from what I can remember of making it years ago)....I used tomato sauce (ketchup) instead of tomato paste and I added a couple of dashes worcestershire sauce and did not have to use salt.  I also discovered that I did not have enough potatoes, so added a sweet potato to the mashed potato...this was delicious and gave the pie a sweetish taste!!  YUMMY!!!

Pretty good.  Will probably make again, but with more vegetables.  Also, turned out a bit greasier that I'd like (and I tried to drain the grease before putting the meat mixture in the baking dish).  Definitely use lean ground beef for this one.

Had Cottage Pie for the first time in Ireland.This recipe was very good, but different.  In contact with the person who made it in Ireland.  Trying to get her recipe.  May have been the cinnamon.

My picky English husband enjoys this.  I've made it many times and sometimes make substitutions, like adding frozen peas & carrots mix instead of the fresh carrots.  This is a meal my whole family enjoys!

first time making something like this and it was great! THE only changes I made were to add green beans. Also I use a food mill for the potatoes and it makes such a difference.

Very good. I used ketchup and the full amount of cinnamon, and it was a little too sweet and "cinnamony." The cup of milk made the potatoes nice and smooth. Before baking I topped the pie with some melted butter and shaved parmesan, like they do at the Chip Shop in Brooklyn. Will make again (with some alterations)!

Great comfort food. Made only two small alterations- used Laura's lowfat ground turkey and about a T of butter in the meat mixture. I used an english farmhouse cheddar for the potatoes but thought that it would have been just as good without, or with less cheese. Cinnamon is key. My boyfriend who neither likes onions or casseroles said this was great. A keeper.

This is wonderful comfort food! It makes a lot, so I used a 13x9 baking dish. I also used frozen garlic mashed potatoes to save time - even so, from start to finish it took nearly an hour and a half to prepare - but it's worth it! Definitely a keeper.

I left out the cinnamon and the cheese and pie crust as these weren't to our taste. I added a handful of chopped mushrooms and a small can of garden peas into the mix. I also added a dash of worcestershire sauce and lots of salt & pepper. The great thing about this recipe is that you can chop and change the ingredients and it still tastes great!

I loved this recipe!!  I did change it a bit...I added 1/2 cup red wine to the broth (and decreased the broth by 1/2 cup-it was delicious!  I also added frozen peas to the mix and baked it in a 9x9 pan because it wouldn't have fit in a pie plate.  I would also reccommend peeling the potatoes before starting the meat mixture...it would have gone smoother if I would have done that first. Great recipe...I will make this one again and again!

this is good but I gave it 4 stars because the cinnamon is a bit too strong, the next time I make this it will be with less cinnamon and maybe some garlic sauted with the meat.

We liked this, made recipe to a T.  Next time I will cut back on the cinnamon as it was just a little to strong for us and maybe add some garlic, only because we like it in our dishes.

My friends all love this recipe! I cooked it for my family and decided to save some for a few friends. They liked it so much, I had to make a few more batches for them. They've asked for it on their birthdays as a gift, so glad I didn't have to shop anymore!

Excellent recipe. I didn't use as much cinamon, and used more carrots, I just love the way they cook soft in cottage pies. Great idea for leftover mashed potatoes.

Besides the fact that the original cottage pies were made with mutton or lamb this turned out quit well when adding the suggestions from the other reviewers, it otherwise might have been to bland ( I also added my favorite thing to it, hot pepper flakes ). I was not disappointed, the kids were not so thrilled about the taste, but they ate it all.

I lived in England for awhile as an exchange student and my host mother served me cottage pie and hers wasn't as good as this one.

My kids loved this! Next time I will double the recipe, because there wasn't much left for my husband when he got home. I didn't use the cinnamon and I cut back a little on the italian spices. Very good.
