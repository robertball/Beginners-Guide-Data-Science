This is the ultimate!!! My dad (very anti-one-dish-meals) LOVES this. I make this in a 13x9 pan and only double the baking mix, eggs, and milk. To add to the mexican flavor, I add one can of refried beans. This can be added to the ground beef after cooking or can be layered into the pan. I also began adding tomatos, olives, and mushrooms, and again add them into the pot or layer them. This is a totaly versital recipie and I love it!!!!

I chose to omit the chopped onion and green pepper because we don't like those.  Instead I got some extra flavor by using the "taco" seasoned cheese mix instead of cheddar.  I'd never used biscuit mix in a quiche before, but I really loved how it tasted.  The top browned beautifully in the oven and it was de-lish!

The only thing I'm going to do differently next time is mix the cheese in with the meat instead of just layering it on top.  It could be that I used too much meat, but I think mixing the cheese in will help it all stick together better.

Very nice recipe.  Thank you.

Okay so I took the advice of others, and added my own touches... I did the corn bread topping instead of the bisquick, I also added a can of corn, a can of chili beans, and a can of olives sliced up. I sprinkled the cheese ontop of the meat, and then added the corn bread, it was AMAZING... My mother, who is staying with us for a couple weeks, and I both loved it, and my DD loved it as well. I will definatley be making this for my husband when he comes back home from deployment... I also garnished with home made salsa and sour cream, soooo yummmy!!!

This was SO easy to make and it turned out great!  I decided to use 1/2 a lb of hamburger and doubled the onions but you would never have known I skimped on the meat. I will be making this one again.

I thought this was out of this world.I left out the green bell pepper,and added a small can of green chiles. My husband usually doesn't comment on my cooking but he said this recipe would be great in his book to make again.

I have made this recipe twice and thought it was great both times.  The second time, I made it with half/half (had some left over) and it made it so-o-o-o-o good.  This one is worth a try.

Yum! This recipe is tasty as written, and very versatile. The second time I added one egg, used only 1/2 lb of taco seasoned meat, added about 1/2 cup of additional leftover veggies (mushrooms, red bell pepper, some pureed spinach & broccoli), used "fiesta" seasoned shredded cheese, and replaced half the milk with evaporated milk. I also added some ground flax seed and about 2 Tbsp of salsa, and mixed the cheese in instead of topping with it. Delicious!

Very good family freindly meal that lends intself well to experimenting (my favorite way to cook).  The only adjustment I would make next time is to cook the meat just like you would for regular taco meat (adding water).  Not sure if I messed up the recipe, or it was just a tad dry.  I will be making this one again and have already recommended it to freinds and family.

My toddlers found this dish too spicy, but the rest of us loved it. We used green onions and a yellow pepper and a green chili instead. Really great with sour cream.

What an easy and delicious dinner!  We have changed up the ingredients in this recipe to make other quiches and it comes out great every time!  We have done breakfast sausage and cheddar cheese and ham and swiss cheese.  Fantastic!

This was very tasty but I would never call this quiche.  Actually it was very similar to a Taco Bake recipe I've seen on the back of the baking mix box. I used ground turkey for this and made my own taco seasoning to cut back on the salt. Enjoyed by all Mary and thank you!

This turned out great! I was looking for a simple ground-beef dinner idea and found this. Found out I was out of ground beef so I did this: Dumped a can of black beans, a can of kidney beans, a can of corn, and a large can of crushed tomatoes in a pan. I added some leftover white rice and the taco seasoning. Brought it to a boil and then let it simmer for a few minutes. Poured it into a 9x13 pan and poured the Bisquick-egg-milk mixture on top. It was tasty and my family liked it! (My dh added salt, I added Tabasco.) Next time, though, we're making it with a cornbread topping. That sounds perfect. I'll make this again with or without the ground beef!

i made this vegetarian by adding 1/2 a package of tofu, cubed, 1-2 oz. of chopped mushrooms, and a can of drained black beans. (i fried the tofu with some worcestershire and soy sauce to give it some flavor) i also substituted the pepper with a small can of diced green chiles and added some green onion. SO GOOD AND EASY!

I made this last night doubling the topping as suggested to fit in a 9 X 13 pan.  I used 5 eggs.  Garnished the quiche with salsa, sour cream and fresh chopped avacado, which was a wonderful addition to the quiche.

I always make the recipe accordingly, and then think of IF I need to tweek it a bit.  Surprisingly, I LOVED this, but I think it needs just one more thing.  Thanks for a great recipe!!  Truly delicious exactly as is!

Delicious and easy! I only changed a couple things...used green onions instead of regular and replaced the green pepper with diced green chilis for more spice. I topped each serving with sour cream & salsa...fabulous!

I made this last night for dinner, and it was a hit! I used 1.5 green peppers (had to use them up), a red onion, and a can of corn in addition to the meat. Due to the amount of veggies, I doubled the baking mix/milk/egg part, but used 5 eggs instead of 4 based on other reviews. I ended up being able to make 2 9-inch pie plates and a 9x9 casserole pan of this quiche, which was a good thing--only half of the 9x9 casserole was left at the end! (I fed 3 adults, a 2-yr-old, and a 13 month old). Excellent with salsa on top. I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent recipe. We had never made Quiche before and were very satisfied with not only the taste, but with the ease of making it. Thank you!

I was a little scared to try this recipe, but trust me it is well worth it! I made it with 1/2lb of ground beef and added in lots of peppers and onions in the taco mix. I layer crumbled bacon on top of the cheese and ground beef. I also add some cayenne pepper to the egg mixture. I LOVE this recipe, I made two pans last time and it was all gone within the hour! You have to try this!

Pretty good recipe.  I need a casserole dish for our weekly church lunch.  Several people don't eat tomatoes or potatoes or green pepper, which seemed to be the things I would want in a casserole. But I found this, changed out the green pepper for green chiles and well-a.  Rave reviews for all.  I am making it for the 2nd time to enjoy with the family at home.

Definitely fast and easy but very bland. The family complained that it didn't have any taste. I agree. Sorry.

It is a good basic recipe and i have made it several times i only give it a 4 because i added some stuff to it i added rice, black beans, and corn to your likeing i added about half a can of each veggie and  1/2 cup or so of rice and more cheese than it calls for because we love cheese, i just felt it neede a little more substance and adding those makes it so much more filling i will keep this one in my box of tricks thanks for the recipes 
PS love alaska lived there for 3 years want to come back lol

This was really good, I would rate it 5 stars, but consensus from the family rates it a 4.

I made this recipe subbing chili beans for the ground beef. I combined the beans with stewed chili tomatoes and fresh onion and red and green bell pepper. I have to say I was skeptical about using baking mix, but this is fantastic comfort food! I will definitely make it again.

This was very good!  It didnt take long to brown the ground beef and get it in the oven.  By the time I bathed the kids, dinner was hot and ready.  Perfect for a week night!  My husband ate half of it himself though, so once my son gets a little bigger I may not be able to feed all of 4 us with this dish without adding a side.  But it's great!
Update:  I doubled the recipe this time and it was more than enough for my husband this time.  We had left overs.  I used the recipe Taco Seasoning I this time, and it was great with it!

This recipe is great on days when time gets away from you. It is so easy and tastes really good. My husband does not even like mexican-type food said this was a definite keeper.

I made this for dinner the other night and it came out just fine.  I had never used a baking mix when making a quiche so I wasn’t sure how it would taste, but it turned out not to be an issue.  I can see that this recipe would be easy to customize and wish I had waited until tonight to make it as I have some things in the fridge that need to be used up.
