Loved this Chicken! I used way too much amaretto and basted throughout the baking process. It was a little too sweet and candied at first but then I remmebered the little lemon in his butt and squeezed that on the meat and the tartness really set off the sweet flavor. I would recommend roasting a whole lemon. I also rubbed the skin with garlic and salt.

This was really good and alot of taste for a low sodium diet. I changed very little. I added chopped fresh Rosemary to the butter and spread this paste under the skin along with rubbing it on the outside of the skin. To the drippings I added no sodium chicken granulated flavoring (it's like boulion with out all the salt, found in any grocery store)reduced the drippings then added some flour to thicken. You don't have to be on a low sodium diet to like this dish.

The chicken is delicious and very tender, I would add a one more person to the amount of people you are actually serving because the chicken goes fast. It is also very easy to make with barley any fuss.

This was awesome, I submerged the chicken in saltwater in the fridge over night then washed it all off before I cooked it. I also put some butter cuts on the breast under the skin. I donâ€™t feel like it was too greasy at all, and I am very sensitive to greasy things.

I was concerned when I read that this dish turned out greasey for the reviewer below so I added some chicken stock to this recipe.  As the chicken was roasting, I would baste it every 25 minutes or so.  I would alternate between using chicken stock and amaretto and I think that it helped add another layer of flavor and kept the chicken a little moister.

This is a classic (and classy),  no fail recipe.  My husband loves this and think that if we were to find it in a restaurant the dish would easily be $30 per person.  I add small mushroom, onions and carrots around the chicken.

I had 3 small chickens to use. I rubbed all with garlic then the butter. I then threw garlic, 1/2 a lemon and a couple of tbs. of fresh thyme and 1 tbs. of butter in the chicken. Poured the amaretto over and sprinkled with a little more thyme. I don't think all the butter is really necessary.
Very tender, juicy and flavourful.

The chicken was very tender and flavorful, but the drippings in the pan were useless for gravy.  It tasted like straight liqueur.  I tried everything I could think of to tone down the amaretto flavor, but it was too overpowering... even without adding the additional 1/4 cup amaretto.

This was easy to fix and had a very good flavor, next time I would salt and pepper chicken. The gravy was VERY good.

Incredibly disappointing. Didn't't notice the flavor one bit. Save your expensive liqueur for something else.

Love this. Because it is summer time here and I did not want to turn on the oven I cooked it in a covered grill, in a aluminum pan covered with foil. It worked great no left overs :-)

I've made this 2 times now. I changed it a bit. Mixed 1tsp each of basil, rosemary, thyme, garlic, a little salt, pepper with about 3 tbsp of Amaretto and about 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Poured over the chicken and used the rest to baste with. I also put garlic pieces and butter under the skin of the chicken. I used a little less lemon and added a few celery sticks inside the chicken. Came out GREAT! My grandchildren loved it. Cutting the Amaretto down helped when I made the gravy too.

To be fair, I brushed the chicken with lemon olive oil and skipped the butter.  I also used an orange in place of the lemon, as this was what I had on hand.  The chicken was okay, but the sweet sauce was just weird. Maybe the butter would have made a difference but I won't try this again.

I am sorry but this did not work for me or my family. I LOVE amaretto and thought this would be great,but it did not mesh well. The chicken was very moist and tasted great but as soon as you put the gravy on, it destroys this dish!

Sorry, but this recipe just didn't make it with me.  Totally bland and I followed the recipe completely.  As for the aroma, it didn't even come close to a nice chicken sprinkled with basil, rosemary, and thyme.  The good news was that the chicken was tasteless enough that I could use the leftover meat to make enchiladas the next day.

My family was not crazy about the sauce.  My 11-year old said it tasted like a cookie, so apparently too sweet.  The chicken itself was moist and tender, but would not do the sauce again.

I had high hopes for the flavor from this recipe. I found it bland and a dreadful waste of my precious amaretto. It smelled divine while cooking, but just tasted like plain old chicken with barely any flavor. The "gravy" was just pan drippings with amaretto. It didn't really stick to the meat and I couldn't think of something suitable to serve it with...plain rice? Not really my style. So all in all, this was a bum dish for me.

I think this is a GREAT change of pace for chicken!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Mixed other ingred together and poured over the chicken.  I did not make gravy just served the juices over rice.  VERY GOOD!  YUM!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but plan on trying.  I am going to use a roasting bag and that should take care of the need to baste and not let it dry out.  I am also going to use less butter to help it be more waste watcher friendly.  I'll let you know how it turns out after I try it this way....or if you beat me to it, let me know.

We LOVED this.  Very flavorful.  Ours didn't come out greasy at all.  Really yummy.  My kids couldn't get enough of this dish.

Not sure where I went wrong -- followed recipe exacatly, and was hoping for a lot of flavor -- it just wasn't there.... sorry.
