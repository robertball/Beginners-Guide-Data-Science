I loved this salad!!  Instead of using Kecap Manis (which I am not completely sure what that is) I just mixed equal amounts of brown sugar and soy sauce and it came out perfect!!  I also added a little rice vinegar to my liking.  It was a good change from ordinary salad.

Delicious!!!  I didn't add the chilli oil as I didn't have any and only a few drops of the sesame oil. Added some red pepper & cashew nuts to the salad and some brown sugar to the dressing to balance the salty fish sauce. Just the perfect salad for a summer evening.

Delicious!  I made it just the way the recipe requested (doubling the sauce) and served over rice noodles.  It was fabulous!  It's refreshing to serve something that everyone is wondering when we'll have it again.  Thanks for the terrific recipe.

This was super delicious.  I used half the fish sauce and substituted 1TB soy sauce + 1 scant TB brown sugar for the kecap manis.   Used eye of chuck which is similar to ribeye and pan fried in a very hot cast iron skillet.  Very yummy!

Great salad.  Followed recipe exactly and added toasted peanuts as a garnish.  Lovely sweet and sour dressing with just enough of a spicy kick.

I thought this recipe was too salty. I made the recipe as written.  I even had the kecap manis in my cabinet.  There was no balance of flavors, just too much salt.  If I make it again (maybe) I would decrease the fish sauce and increase the Kecap Manis.  I would even add a little chili-garlic sauce for a little heat.

Wonderful salad that's very similar to what we typically have in Thai restaurants.  I didn't have any cilantro and used parsley instead.  It was still good but I think the cilantro would have made it even better.  Added sambal oelek (an Indonesian chilli sauce) and chilli flakes for an even spicier taste.  Yummy!

This was SOOOO GOOD!  I might cut back on the sesame oil a little next time, but just for my taste preference.  I did add a little sugar to the dressing as I like my Asian food pretty sweet.  I served this over some chopped iceberg lettuce to make it more of a salad and served a side of white rice as well.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I thought this salad was AWESOME! Very comparable to what you would get at a Thai restaurant, only 1/4 of the price! It fed my boyfriend and i for under 10$!!! I only used 1/2 the fish oil, and crushed red chili pepper and 1/2 a lemon in place of the chili oil.  I also couldnt find the Kecap Manis, so i just omitted it. I can see how it may sweeten it up a bit tho. The store i went to didnt have Thai chili peppers so i used and  Anehiem pepper instead. All in all, we were very satisfied with this recipe!

I felt this dressing had too much fish sauce in it.  My husband is on a low sodium diet and it was quite salty.  I also added some rice wine vinegar and pepper flakes.  Other than that, it had a very good flavor.  It is surprising how the flavors blend.  I'm not sure I would try it again.

Loved this!  It slightly salty, but the fish sauce is adjustable, so add that to taste.  I did not have time to make the kecap manis and will do so for next time, as I am sure that will influence the salt.

I put the whole thing over a bed of romaine, and it was terrific.  My whole family loved it!  I have two picky eaters who loved the meat in particular.

This was yummy. I think it may have had a little too much lime, I also added 2 cloves of garlic, I think that it helped. This is very simaler to a Thai restaurant here in Salt Lake. I  think I will play with it next time. Thanks.

This tastes EXACTLY like the Spicy Beef Salad at my local Thai restaurant!  I did not add the chili peppers, and used one part molasses to 2 parts soy sauce to substitute kecap manis.  It was so good, I made it for dinner 2 nights in a row!!

Absolutely wonderful! I loved it, and it's a salad the rest of the family will eat. DH said he would prefer less ginger. In place of the thai chiles, I used a poblano pepper for the family and added serrano to mine only. Upped the veggies with two small cucumbers, extra tomato, and two shredded carrots. Served on a bed of green leaf lettuce.

made this for a light lunch for myself.. i scaled it down to what would be 1/2 a single serving.. i used what i had on hand.. bottled lemon juice for the lime and left out the kecap manis, shallots, and thai chili peppers.. the dish had more than enough punch so i didn't feel it was missing them.. i wish i would have had the lime though.. i'm sure it would have made it taste much more like the thai steak salads i've had in the past but i still enjoyed this one.. i used half fish sauce and half soy sauce as others did.. ty for the recipe

I used this recipe as a marinade for a flank steak, so minus the salad part.  The steak loved it.  We loved it. I highly recommend it. I got a kecap manis recipe from a google search and it is definately worth making as well.  I have used the sauce for other things too.

Decent, but not superb.  Tastes like Thai, it just wasn't quite right for me.
