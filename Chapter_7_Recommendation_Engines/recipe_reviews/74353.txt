Personally didn't care for the mayo/oil & vinager combo. Would probably have liked better with fat free italian dressing or even greek dressing.

Made as directed and it was very good.  I read the oil and vinegar salad dressing to mean an Italian dressing and so used one I had on hand and NO mayo.  Thanks for another way to use capers!

This was a really popular dish at a recent family dinner!  However, to add more veg, I did include some diced red and yellow peppers.

Very good take...i lessened the mayo and chopped up the shrimp to get it more bite sized.  Capers are juniper berries that have been brined, i used the non-pareil size.  Very strong, so i chopped and smashed them with my big knife.  Also less vinegar was used.  I like my shrimp salad pretty dry.

My 1st recipe using capers. Wandered around trying to find capers in the grocery. What IS a caper anyway? But my wife wanted this, so I found the capers and made the dish. Still have no idea what a CAPER is exactly, but the dish was very good. Seriously though, what IS a caper?

A caper is not a pickled juniper berry it is the bud of a fleshy leaved flowering plant. A less pickled taste to the dressing in combination with the capers would be to use lemon juice rather than vinegar.

This was so darned tasty and I will definitely add this to my summer menus. I did go a little light on the celery seed because a little goes a long way for us. Other than that...NO changes. Just a yummy and simple salad. Thanks for sharing!
