Definitely a 5+!  The first batch out of the oven were gone by the time the second batch came out. Everyone agreed they were delicious, and it is a recipe worth saving. This recipe needs no changes.  Thanks for sharing it.

I made these when friends came to visit and they were gone before I knew it!  Just the right combination of salty and sweet.

These were delicious, easy, and extremely popular.  Just an idea, but next time I would bake them on a baking rack on a foil lined cookie sheet.  That way, any bacon grease will drip down rather than cook into the food and clean-up will be easier.  These we so good and they went fast.  Those who asked for the recipe were suprised at how simple they were to make.  These will be regulars when I serve appetizers.  Thanks!

I've made a similar recipe for years for all family holiday gatherings.  The only variance is that slice the date lengthwise and fill it with honey walnut cream cheese before wrapping with bacon.  Don't overstuff and be sure to broil them slit side up.   YUM!!!

I tried these in the microwave,using thin sliced bacon,and we didn't think they were good enough to bother making them for a party, sorry. Too much trouble and not enough flavor for us.

These were ok, just too sweet.  I tried cut in thirds like recipe and in half one way and half the other way.  I liked the second way best.  The bacon was skinnier and I didn't need a toothpick.  I also tried another recommendation with a smoked almond inside.  It added good flavor, but the almond was steamed inside the date and bacon.  I didn't like it as much then because the nut was soft.

I think it was just not to my personal taste. I'm giving it four stars because if it was something other than a date, it would have been amazing. The bacon tasted awesome, but the date wasn't very nice. My sister was pulling the bacon off the date and eating it.

These are easy and good.  They definitely need to be broiled though, with the rack set close to the broiler.  Also yummy with a little brown sugar stuffed in the dates!

Very different... but very good! All my family looked at them kind of weird when they came out of the oven, but all I heard were mmmmm's when they took their first bite:) I'd make again, although wouldn't go out of the way to buy the ingredients specifically for this.

When I make these, I do partially cook the bacon before wrapping the dates.  I always cook my bacon on a sheet pan so you can cook a ton of it at once and it stays flat.  Then its just a quick heat up in the oven when its time to serve.  These are the easiest appetizer and always a big hit.  To make them more special, you can stuff the dates with cheese, a nut or an olive, but they are a lovely salty sweet bite just the way they are.

I have lived in Spain for 3 years and loved this appetizer. My mom and I make it all the time and its so easy to use. In reference to an earlier review, microwaving these don't do it any justice. It has to be baked in the oven. Also if you don't want to take time to pit dates just go to the snack aisle in your grocery store and buy the already pitted dates. A friend of my mother also suggested soaking the bacon in pineapple juice overnight and then wrap the bacon around the dates and continue on with the recipe.

Good...but they can easily go from good to outstandiny simply by pitting the date and stuffing with brie.  A little time consuming, but worth it!!

I love how easy this was! I was running low on bacon, so I used 1/3 a lice per date. I brought them to a work party and everyone loved them. I would definitely make them again.
