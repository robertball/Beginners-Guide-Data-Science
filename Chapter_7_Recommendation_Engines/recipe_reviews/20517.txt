This salad was awesome and got rave reviews from the ultra picky husband!   The only things I changed were adding fresh parmesean cheese and I drizzled honey over the pecans before baking.  Also, the 1/4 cup of poppy sead dressing seemed to be too much and made the spinach leafs a little soggy, so I had to add a cup more spinach.  So you might want to add dressing to taste instead of pouring the whole 1/4 cup in like I did.

We are in LOVE with this recipe.  It is so much greater than the sum of its parts.  Who would think so few ingredients could make such an impact.  The first night we ate so much of it we were too full for the rest of our dinner, so the next time I made it I grilled some chicken to serve on top and that was our dinner - very yummy!  I used Paula's Poppyseed Dressing recipe from this website and it was fantastic.  We avoid sugar so I substituted Splenda in the dressing recipe and we all loved it!  One time I was out of pecans so I used walnuts and it was just great - the important part is the toasting.  Thanks so much for this new staple in our house. Edited to add that I have now tried it with grilled steak on it as well.  We will use this every way we can think of.

Terrific recipe. Great tasting and super quick. I also make a variation of this using strawberries and pink grapefruit sections, everything else is the same. The color of the peaches against the spinach was beautiful.

FABULOUS salad combination!! My husband, who is a salad connoisseur, said that it is perfect as is. Believe me, this is very high praise coming from him! I served with a strawberry vinaigrette I'd made for another salad - it was perfect!  Here's the recipe for it for those who are interested:   In a small jar, combine the following ingredients and shake thoroughly (can use a blender for an even smoother consistency):  2 tsp. strawberry jam 1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar 1/2 tsp. sugar 3 Tbsp. olive oil Salt and Pepper, to taste

Excellent combo of flavors and colors. I used Brianna's poppyseed dressing- it was $3 for the bottle- very good. I think adding strawberries would be a nice touch too.

I made this recipe for a family July 4th get-together.  Super easy and very good.  I bought a large bag of pre-washed baby spinach and used a good bottled dressing and  this salad was ready in minutes.  A nice and different combination of flavors.  Make sure you roast your pecans.  Will make this again especially when fresh peaches are in their prime

Nice combination of flavors and colors, but...is the dressing part of the recipe missing?  I bought a bottle of poppyseed dressing and it was ok but not great.  I bet a great dressing recipe would make this sing.

This salad is easy to make but tastes like a specialty salad.  It was a hit with our entire extended family!  We made it the second time for a church picnic but this time put in the spinach, then the peaches, then the nuts WITHOUT MIXING so that all the heavy bits don't settle to the bottom before we got there.  Upon arrival we added the dressing then lightly tossed it. Over 3,000 people have made this and not a one made their own custom version.  That just shows how perfect this salad is as it stands.

This was very good, cut the recipe in half for my husband and myself; used an old poppy seed dressing recipe.  Will add this to my "tried and true" recipes.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good salad. I didn't have the Poppyseed Dressing so I used the Kraft Raspberry Vinegrette and it was awesome. Very light and fresh. I'm thinking of maybe adding grilled chicken to it next time.

This was a great salad. I used mixed baby greens and added fresh blueberries along with the peaches. I also added grated Asiago cheese, chives, and freshly  ground black pepper. I used poppyseed dressing by Paula from this site and spruced up the dressing by adding a little more vinegar, dry mustard, and grated sweet onion. I put the dressing on the salad to taste instead of all at once. Lastly, I added some grilled chicken. Delicious.

Nice salad, but really it's all in the dressing.  If this would have included how to make a good poppyseed dressing rather than pouring store bought dressing on spinach I would rate much higher.

Super, super super!!  Loved by all here!!  I was not a big fan of the poppyseed dressing.  Next time I'll look up a homemade poppyseed dressing.  I also substituted peaches with nectarines and plums.  I used baby spinach and a baby romaine blend, which was nice.  Oh and I added grilled chicken, which was a wonderful addition!!  Definitely will make again!!

A truly lovely salad that can fit in equally well for a special luncheon, a fine steak dinner, a nicely prepared chicken, etc., etc., --- or simply a nice change of pace for lunch for yourself.  Exceptional!

This was delicious, a hit for dinner.  I've tried alot of peach salads, but this was simple and delightful!  Only think I would change is to make my own dressing.  And the lighter the dressing, the better!

Bravo!  (and this would make with a great piece of grilled chicken or salmon!)

Five stars is not enough for this wonderful refreshing summer salad. We made this with some fresh Georgia peaches leaving the skin on. I used Paula's poppy seed dressing from AR for our dressing, which also is a five star dressing. If you love peaches...you must try this salad.

This was great! Made with the Poppy Seed Dressing II recipe from this site. We might even prefer this to the typical strawberry salad because the peaches are juicy. I'll keep this recipe for another time!

Wonderful blend of flavors and textures in this. I used saturn peaches which turned out really mushy after roasting and the peels came off when I cut them so I think a freestone peach would be a better choice the next time. It didn't say whether to half the peaches and roast them cut side up or whole so I left mine whole. It certainly wasn't fun trying to remove hot peach flesh from a pit without tearing the flesh to pieces as it was so mushy. I wish I had toasted the pecans it would have added that little extra oomph to this already wonderful salad. But yeah it really seemed to need just a little something more. Thanks Robin this was a wonderful meal!

Love  spinach salads, and this salad was no disappointment for sure. I had some leftover fresh blueberries to use, and threw them on top in addition to the fresh peaches. Great recipe - thanks!

After reading reviews I have changed a few things in the recipe and loved the result! I made it with mango, added feta, grilled chicken breast and finely chopped red onion. Also, I am not a great fan of dressings, so I just used some fresh lemon juice, salt and pepper. Great dinner.

I made this salad tonight for a potluck and it got rave reviews.  I'm not big on salad, so I wanted to try something new and different.  It is very surprising how amazing these flavors go together.  I never think to add fruit to salad.  I used Brianna's Poppyseed dressing and added gorgonzola crumbles (I love gorgonzola with fruit).  Delicious!

This salad was very good. My garden produced more spinach than I had anticipated. This salad was a nice changed from the traditional. I did not have fresh peaches so drained and rinsed a can peaches. It was still very good. I think the key is toasting the pecans.

I don't give perfects usually unless it is outstanding...this salad is SO good I, a non-salad eater, cannot get enough of it. Aside from my own dinners, I made it for a few get togethers and it was GONE. Lots of compliments. And to top it off, it is QUICK and EASY to make. As a mother of toddler twins that is a huge benefit.

Very nice salad.  At first, I wasn't sure what to think, but once I got a bite of everything all together, I felt it was awesome.  I love the peaches in this and think it makes the salad.  It seems like way too many pecans, however, so I'd cut those down.   I put a homemade poppy seed dressing over this--used Poppy Seed Salad Dressing on this site and thought it went well with the salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great combination. I made my own poppyseed-lemon vinaigrette and it was really good. I think this salad does beg for cheese, though. We ended up throwing some blue cheese on it; feta or parmesan would also be lovely. Thanks!

This has become my go-to salad recipe! Everyone raves about it. I use the Poppy Seed Salad Dressing on this site posted by Gay Nell Nicholas. The only tips I would have for this salad recipe is to MAKE SURE you use the best, freshest ingredients. Go to your best produce store, every extra penny spent is worth it. I made the mistake of getting less-than-best spinach and peaches one time, and it ruined the whole thing. Make sure the peach skin is on the lighter side than the darker side. The peaches have to be crisp when you cut them, not soft inside. I also recommend you cut the peaches thin because if the slices are too thick, then they sink down to the bottom of the salad bowl, and people don't scoop them out as easily. Good luck!

It's not the type of salad I'd be likely to select because I'm not huge on fruit in salads, but I trusted the reviews and went for it...and I'm glad I did because this was a HUGE hit at the bridal shower I threw  yesterday and several people have already asked me for the recipe.

This recipe was quite the hitat my dinner party!  I had to deal with off-season flavorless peaches so after I cut them up I sprinkled a bit of sugar and almond flavoring on them and let them sit for about 15 minutes.  Worked VERY well.

I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed this recipe.  I usually do not like fruit in salads, the peaches made a wonderful addition.  In addition, I actually used sliced almonds, just because we like them better.

Very tasty.  Did not use pecans but switched with candied walnuts.  Will make this several times while peaches are in season.

I was looking for a full-meal salad, so just drizzled some boneless, skinless chicken breast with the poppyseed salad dressing and threw that on the George Foreman to add to the salad. Delicious! I also kept the peach skins on (washed, of course) which added even more texture. This beautiful salad tasted even better the next day with only some canned chicken (I think the peaches had sweetened even more). For leftovers' sake, I'd keep the dressing off until serving so the spinach doesn't wilt. Thanks!

What a quick and easy, tasty and delicious salad! It looks so fancy when it's put together and it's so refreshing on a hot summer day.  When I didn't have fresh peaches, I used nectarines.  They taste incredible with white flesh peaches and nectarines too.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Pretty good, but will depend on how sweet the peaches are. I didn't bother roasting the pecans. Used the poppy seed dressing from this site by Deborah.

No fresh peaches yet; so I used oranges. I made a No Salt Vinaigrette from this site instead of the poppyseed dressing suggested, served it on the side for individual tastes.  Topped it with homemade Cinnamon Crouton, also from this site.  We enjoyed this very much;  can't wait to make it using fresh peaches.  Thanks for posting, Robin Durawa.

If you love peaches you will probably love this salad. Very summery and so easy to put together. After making this salad a few times, as is, I decided that it would benefit from another layer of flavor so I now add a couple of chopped green onions. Chopped red onion would be good too. I tried topping with chicken but did not like that so much. Chicken on the side is much better. I have made my own poppyseed dressing but, in a pinch, use poppyseed dressing that is sold refrigerated next to the salad greens.

I used a bottled poppyseed dressing and the salad was fairly unspectacular. Next time I'll try it with my homemade dressing, which I think might give better results.

This was a nice change from our usual salad rotation, and went well with our meal of grilled salmon steaks and rosemary bread. Didn't have pecans so used walnuts instead. The store-bought poppyseed dressing overpowered the flavor of the peaches and spinach, though, so we will have try something else if we make this again.

.......burned the pecans......Got to learn to pay closer attention. This combined with the fact that the peaches were not ripe enough (too hard) made this one a bit of a challenge. This was counter-balanced by the incredible "Poppy Seed Dressing I" that I got from this site. Next time, I'll monitor the roasting of the pecans better and use peaches from a can.

Absolutely delicious!  I used the Brianna Poppy Seed dressing since I was short on time. I would make it the same way again and not change a thing!  Entire family loved it!

This is a really nice summertime salad.  I didn't have poppyseed dressing so I used italian dressing instead; it worked well.  I've also made this with roasted pine nuts instead of pecans and that's good too.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks!

Only because I made this recipe on the spur of the moment and had some perfectly ripe peaches I sumbstituted walnuts         for the directed peacans and used fat free raspberry peacan dressing.  It was great tasting combination of flavors and refreshing on a hot summer evening.

Made it for a Ladies-Sunday Alta Tennis Match. 
Anyone playing tennis in the ATL Area knows  the Food provided is almost as important as winning the match. LOL!!  ??????
That day -the salad along with me a my tennis partner  were ... “Big Hitters” - “Aced it” - “Winners!”
Making the Salad for my Family tomorrow. 
Plan to add Grilled Chicken & like the Parmesan Cheese suggestion.

Excellent salad - will definitely make again.  This was so good, we made it our main course!  The only change I made was to the pecans - it was too hot to turn the oven on, so I put them in the salad raw, and they were delicious.

What a great salad. Made exactly as directed, used calorie-wise dressing and there was not one bite left in the bowl. Hubby even went back for 2nds!  Fabulous! Try this.

We loved this! I didn't really use the measurements, just grabbed two big handfuls of spinach, toasted the amount of pecans I thought would be good for two salads and cut up one lovely ripe peach (no need to peel it) to divide between the two salads. We drizzled some poppyseed dressing and it was a perfect light dinner for us!

Nice combo and easy salad to make. This can also be made for the fall by adding a few dried tart cherries, some almond slices and maybe  bit's of cranberry goat cheese. If fresh peaches are  other available use jarred places but drain well. Also you can use different greens. Easy and good compliment to any dinner.

Wonderful salad if you have sweet southern peaches!  I used walnuts instead of pecans ( because I had them).  I also used Briannas' Poppy seed dressing which has a wonderful flavor.

I made this for a picnic last night.  Soooo easy, yes I made a few minor changes -  used 1/2 spinach and 1/2 arugula.  Then what seemed to be the wow factor was adding some crumbled plain goat cheese when combining all ingredients.  Felt so healthy especially with the Colorado peaches that  have just arrived I Minnesota.will definitely make again

Excellent recipe, just the way it is.   Any sweet dressing will take care of the salad.  But I did have poppy seed in the bottle and it was super.  I did not take the time to roast the pecans.

We enjoyed the combination of the peaches and spinach.  I did leave out the pecans as we are not big on nuts in salads, but may add them next time and there will be a next time.  It is a great way to use fresh peaches.

I thought this was great. It was quick and easy and a nice change from a traditional side salad which we have a lot. The only thing I did different was add some blueberries for an additional pop of flavor. Will be making again.

I had to try this since I had all the ingredients for the salad and the Poppy Seed dressing except the Poppy seeds.  It was quick, easy and oh so delicious!  I made half the dressing recipe and still had some leftover.  I'll be making this one again and again!  Update--just finished this salad for the third night in a row. Having company tomorrow and already planning to make it for tomorrow's supper-- need I say more!?

Super easy and surprisingly delicious! Based on other reviews I added the dressing to taste and definitely used less than the 1/4 cup called for (we prefer less dressing in general). I could see this working well with other fruit as well (cherries etc.).

Absolutely delicious combination of flavours. I used a blend of romaine and baby romaine along with a maple balsamic dressing. The end result was delicious served with Addictive Sweet Potato Burrito's from this site.

This salad is delicious - a perfect companion to barbeque chicken or steak.  I chose not to roast the pecans because it was just too hot outside.  I peeled the peaches, diced them into bite size cubes, and added crumbled gorgonzola to the finished product.  Nice...

This is so good.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very pleasantly surprised and continued to eat it for days! I can't wait to share this one with others! I made it just as stated, but can see other nut varieties working just as well! Thanks so much!

What a yummy salad that is sure to wow your guests.  I always toast the pecans in a pan on the stove since it seems like less of a hassle.  I have made this recipe more often with nectarines instead of peaches and it still tastes amazing.

This simple salad is a great blend of flavors.  I also tried adding blueberries which was also very good.

Very good.  I used Brianna's poppyseed dressing that I bought at Safeway and a package of sugared pecan salad sensations.

we prefer a spinach salad such as Strawberry Spinach Salad II but this one was a nice change for one time.  I think it really depends on which dressing you use.

I would have never imagined in a million years I could get my husband to eat spinach, but he loves this salad and so did I. This was great! The combination of the flavors was awesome. Thanks for a great salad.

So delicious and easy to make! I used the Poppyseed Salad Dressing recipe on here, but Brianna's poppyseed dressing would also be good if you want to save time.
