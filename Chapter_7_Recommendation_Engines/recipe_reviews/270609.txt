We like more spice than most people, but I only used 1 tablespoon of sriracha, because 2 tablespoons would be way too much. The heat was fine with only 1 tablespoon. The recipe is very easy to make. My husband thought the ham was a little dry, but this is probably because I am new at using an instant pot and I don't think I did the natural release properly.  I think I may use the quick release next time.
