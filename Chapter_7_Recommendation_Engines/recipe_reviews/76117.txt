This is by far THE BEST recipe I have ever had for creamed corn. I do not really care for the "normal" way cream corn is made. I don't like the soupy consistency or the texture or flavor. I love the baked texture of this!! This recipe was not only delicious, but very easy! This is the only way I will make creamed corn. Great recipe..thanks!

This recipe is definately a keeper!  My family raved about the corn.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9 dish, although next time I will bake an extra 10 minutes.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt, and although I used mozzarella on top, next time I will try Colby Jack or Cheddar.  Highly recommend this recipe!

Only 3 stars b/c I changed it a LOT.  Cut butter, cream cheese, and cream amounts in half, corn upped to 1 pound.  Kept seasonings the same, and this came out GREAT.  Even with the liquids halved, this was still very rich and totally delicious, for me and my sister both.  The only way I'll ever have creamed corn again; thanks!

I ended up modifying this recipe quite a bit, but this gave me a good starting point for my own version.  This recipe as written would be way too rich I think.  I used over twice the amount of corn, used less cream (and switched that to half & half) and the same amount of cream cheese and my version was still VERY rich!  I also gave mine a mexican flair with green chiles and mexican spices.

This is a pretty good recipe, I made it as written the first time and it was good, but the second time I mixed the cheese into the corn mixture and topped it with the cracker crumbs mixed with 2-3 Tbsp of melted butter, and it was GREAT!  The picky eaters in my house loved this dish!

I'm giving this 4 stars, because I think it's a great preparation and I would encourage people to try it.  HOWEVER, I think the proportions of the recipe as written are ludicrous.  I changed the 10 oz bag of corn to the 32 oz FAMILY SIZE bag and thought the recipe came out perfectly.  I would imagine a corn soup would result from the way the recipe is written!  The white pepper and nutmeg are truly what make the flavors so great, so trust the recipe in that regard.  Enjoy!

YUM!!! this was the first time i had made or eaten creamed corn. i cant wait to get home and eat the leftovers! hehe...i made just 2 minor changes. i did not have chicken boullion so i used a seasoning packet from some chicken flavored ramen noodles. i was worried that the recipe would turn out tasting like ramen, but it didnt at all! i also used 2 15oz cans of corn kernals so it wasnt so soupy. my husband was a little worried when i said that i was making creamed corn, but he really liked it too!

Like other reviewers I changed the measurements a little. I used 6 tablespoons of butter, 4 oz cream cheese, 12 oz frozen corn, and a little less than 1/2 cup light cream. I also used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. It was delicious! However, it was way too buttery, next time I will cut the butter to 2 or 4 tablespoons.

My family loved this. I didn't think it looked to good the first time I made it. After one taste....it is officially a Thanksgiving tradition. Never even one bite left.

My husband loved this!  I used 2 16oz pkg of frozen corn, 1 tub plus 3 TB whipped cream cheese and left the cream (well, I subbed 1/2 and 1/2) at the original 1/2 cup.  I threw in about a cup of mozzerella with the corn and also topped with about 1/2 cup.   Subbed garlic salt for regular salt, and that's it!  Was super tasty - and almost seemed like a corn dip!  My kiddo and husband want this regularly!

I thought this was a bit rich, but that's the point of making creamed corn, right! My brother asked for this again for easter, so for some people the richness is not a  problem!

Thought I'd try this instead of my usual recipe.  To my taste, there was too much cream and cream cheese flavor and not enough corn flavor.  Very rich.  My guests seemed to like it so I gave it four stars.

Thought this was fantastic & I'm usually not a huge fan of cream corn. It was a bit salty, but I think that was due to the boullion cube we used. Otherwise, this one is going into high rotation.

Made this recipe for my co-workers Christmas party and it was an absolute hit! Even a woman who is not a fan of creamed corn said she tried it, and actually loved it! Followed the recipe almost to the t, but I omitted nut meg and used two cans of corn, instead of frozen. Definitely will be making this again.

Great recipe! It was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. I doubled the quantity of the corn (the sauce is too rich to my taste) and omitted crackers (we had enough carbs on our table already :). It's also a great side dish for not-so-flavorful main course.

Very rich, but delicious. Cut back on the other ingredients just a bit and increased the corn. (Used a 16oz package instead of 10oz)

The taste is wonderful! It's very rich so I wasn't able to eat a whole lot of it. I think if I were to make this next time, I would add less cream cheese, add some eggs to make a more lighter version.

HEAVY, but very good.  To better deal with the heaviness add them to the holiday mashed potatoes, once served!! then ya won't notice how rich the corn is!

I changed the 10 oz bag of corn to 2-3 bags and thought the recipe came out perfectly.  The white pepper and nutmeg are truly what make the flavors so great, so trust the recipe in that regard. Subbed half and half for heavy cream. Used non-MSG crackers and fresh broth instead of bouillon. Threw in about a cup of mozzarella with the corn and also topped with about 1/2 cup. Subbed garlic salt for regular salt, and that's it! Was super tasty.

This is an awesome recipe but requires quite a bit of tweaking if you don't want an overly soupy consistency.Like prior users wrote,cut down the creams and stuff to half.I used about 20-30 ounces of corn as well.Everyone loves it but it really does require less cream and butter.

I did not care for this at all! So glad I only made half the recipe.  It was lacking something...was so bland. DH thought it was ok. Heated it up the next night and it was tolerable.

4 stars because you have to tweet it - half the butter, cream and cream cheese and substitute the mozerella with sharp cheddar. Turned out awesome this way. Also serve it up over a baked potato, and it was really good for a meal.

I thought I had done somehting wrong, so I double checked, then I triple checked the recipe, but I followed the recipe exactly.... Mine came out greasy/oily and didn't seem to "blend".... It remained kind of separated and just not good at all. Ended up dumping the whole dish. Again, not sure what I could have done wrong, but it was not good. Sorry!!!
