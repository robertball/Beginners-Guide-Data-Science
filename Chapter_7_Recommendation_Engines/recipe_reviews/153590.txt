This chicken was so yummy! I changed things a little bit though. I used chicken pieces and marinated them in the yogurt sauce over night. I doubled the sauce recipe. Instead of adding three tablespoons of curry powder I only added two. Added 4 tablespoons of ketchup. Also I added three minced cloves of garlic. After the chicken was done marinading I crumbed and baked it with a little butter on top! Everyone loved it!

This was a fairly good recipe. Everyone enjoyed it even my three young kids ate all of it and that says alot. I substituted sour cream for the yogurt, ketchup for the tomato sauce, and added minced garlic. I reserved some of the sauce for dipping which helped enhance the flavor of the chicken.

Very tasty - great change in pace from standard chicken dinners.
