Hand down the BEST tomato soup recipe there is! I lost count of how many times I've made this since I discovered this recipe a few months ago. I love how simple it is and it is made from fresh vegetables! I used chicken broth the first couple of times then switched to vegetable broth just as a personal preference. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I made a couple changes to the recipe I'd like to share (I was on a budget).  I nixed the red bell.  I nixed the salt.  I nixed the aluminum foil.  Instead of salt and chicken broth I used 3 cubes of Consomate Tomato and Chicken Bullion (Mexican Section) and 6 cups water.  It'll save you a little, adds good flavor, and gives it more of a red appearance like Campbell's.  Oh, and I used an immersion blender.  All in all my Favorite Tomato Soup!

So simple and delicious! Didn't expect so few ingredients to make such a flavorful soup! I used fresh basil and parsley instead of dried and cut back to 4 cups chicken broth to keep it on the thicker side.  Will definitely make this one again...

omg! I made another tomato soup on AR that I've made for the last couple years that isn't roasted. I wanted to try something different and this soup is wonderful. im not exactly how many pounds of tomatoes I had. A friend gave me a whole bunch of them so I just stuck them all in the oven. I did roast the onion too and I just added the chicken broth slowly until I got the consistency I wanted. I added cheddar cheese on top in my bowl. the best soup ever! I love it! thank you for this recipe.

Very yummy. Few tips - don't use low salt chicken broth like I did. I had to add salt. Next time I'll likely add another roasted pepper and garlic. We ate it with some shaved Parmesan. I'm on my third mug!!

I've made this twice now.  Excellent.  The only change I made was to add a pinch of cayenne.

I did not add the chicken broth. I thought it would make the soup too thin. My tomatoes were very juicy and ripe. Next time I may add a little broth and possibly a little butter and cream.  All of my ingredients were fresh from the garden and I used a good quality Spanish olive oil. (Merula) 
I topped with a Salad blend cheese.
This was easy to make and a very flavorful soup. Great recipe!

Had to go with a 5 star on this one.
I just love the whole concept of roasting veggies and out pops a soup!  The had beefsteak tomatoes on the clearance shelf so I grabbed a bag, almost a perfect 3 lbs.  This is the second time I've made it and very pleased both times.
My tweaks included chopping up half a jalapeno with the tomatoes, sticking a few mushrooms in with double the garlic when I added them to the pan.  Used veggie broth (Better than Boullion) and put a few dashes of Worcestershire in the stock.
Even after sitting for an hour I could notice the flavours deepening.  Will be awesome tomorrow!  Great recipe.  Thank you

Great simple and  delicious recipe! Based on reviews, I used 2 cups of vegetable broth and 2 cups of chicken broth. I also cooked the garlic a little longer separately since it wasn't fully cook/soft when cooking the last 15 min in the oven. I'd recommend adding the garlic cloves from the beginning with the tomatoes and onions.  I used dried parsley/basil, salted to taste, and it was fabulous!

The mixture from the blender was good, but it tastes too chicken broth-y, and I only used 4 cups instead of five.

Excellent!. I used plum tomatoes and whatever other varieties I had from the garden. I did not use salt because low sodium chicken broth has salt in it. When tomatoes were finished roasting, I put everything in a pot and used my cusinart smart stick and whipped everything up. Worked much  better than the blender or food prossessor.  When ready to eat I add Greek trahana (something like pastina but made with flour and cheese. Can be found in Greek stores) it gives the soup more body and is more filling. Without the trahana it's both gluten free and paleo so everyone in the family can enjoy it. I've made this recipe at least 5 times and even made some for the freezer to enjoy later.

This was a lovely and delicious soup! The major ingredients were found at a local farmers' market. I excluded the peppers, but added some alphabet pasta at the end. After sitting overnight, the alphabet pasta plumped up and this became a gorgeous home made Spaghetti-Os!  So good!

This is a great, and malleable, recipe. I didn't have the red pepper, so I omitted it, and also bumped the garlic to 5 cloves. I poured the tomato mixture into the pot of chicken broth and used my immersion blender. I toasted some French bread, buttered it and sprinkled it with some shredded Parmesan. After a quick minute under the broiler, voila, perfect croutons! We absolutely loved it!

After reading the reviews I too added cayenne. This soup is amazing! It's so good I canned it, it cans very easily as well. I did 20lbs of tomatoes and adjusted the recipe accordingly. Love this soup!

Best. Soup. Ever. I use fresh herbs instead of dried, and it becomes this fragrant, colorful pot of deliciousness. Add a side of crusty bread, and you've got a quick and tasty dinner. Plus, the vitamin C from the tomatoes does the trick when I'm sick, and it's easy enough that I can make it while under the weather! Win-win.

Fantastic flavor. I only had "on the vine" tomatoes so I used half fresh tomatoes and half canned tomatoes that were well drained. I also used 4 cups of homemade chicken broth and finished it with one cup of cream mixed in. That really bumped up the nice tomato flavor. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

GREAT way to use up my overly ambitious Costco tomato purchases when the week of salads doesn't go quite to plan.

Added cream but liked it alone, too.

Good recipe for summer’s bounty. It’s a good start for adding additional yummies- I added some barley and fresh herbs- it would be good with tortellini or orzo too. Looking forward to dipping a good grilled cheese into it!

I made this yesterday with a plan to have it for two nights.  Wrong, we ate all of it last night.  I followed the recipe as written, and it was perfect.  The soup is a rich tomato color; it is not too sweet or too acidic.  This is something that could be served to guests!  I made homemade croutons to put on top and that made it even better.  Thank you for this excellent, simple recipe!

I like the simplicity of roasting tomatoes and other veggies for this soup. The roasting makes the flavor rich and sweet.  I think the process of pureeing the veggies and adding to the broth is unnecessarily cumbersome.  I simply pureed all the veggies (including the basil and parsley)  in the blender after they roasted, put the tomato mixture in a large bowl and added  broth until I had the thickness and texture I wanted. I replaced the chicken stock with  vegetable broth and a little  coconut milk due to dietary restrictions.  I put it in the refrigerator overnight to allow the flavors to develop and will adjust seasonings before serving.

I made this almost as instructed except I doubled the basil and parsley onion and red pepper and I roasted once garlic was added another 30 min and I then placed in food processor and then I added it to the chicken broth mixture and cooked for 10 min and this was the best tomato soup ever and will be my new go to for comfort food.

Very good. Would maybe add some milk or cream to bring down some of the acidity. 
Otherwise we loved it!

This is a wonderful soup.  I did reduce the broth to 4 cups since I didn't have the full amount of tomatoes needed and I added two more cloves of garlic. Instead of adding some cayenne pepper (as another person recommended) I added a small hot pepper and it sure gave it some good heat.  We really enjoyed it.

Very good!  I did everything in the recipe.  Some additions were, I left the bell pepper whole as it roasted, I only used fresh basil, and I added a Parmesan rind and let the soup simmer longer after I used the hand blender.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes because my tomatoes weren't "strong" enough.

Simple and delicious. Everyone loved it. I put the vegetables into the broth straight from the oven and used an immersion blender. Will be making this all the time.

Very good but I added 2-3 tbsp tomato paste at the end and let it simmer a bit longer and it had a much better tomato taste! I also used veggie broth instead of chicken.

This was delicious!  I was short a bit on tomato weight, so I upped the red bell pepper.  Also, DBF is vegetarian, so I used veggie broth.  All else was kept the same.  Also, using a food mill did not work on the roasted veggies.  I had to use a blender.  I served this with Brenda's "Garlic Cheese Biscuits" from this site.

AWESOME!  I sub out the chicken broth with my own veggie stock.  No reason, except I had it and I don't think it made it any different.  I so so loved this.  I took pics of it at 4 stages, and then I canned the leftovers.  So easy, and it was 5 stars, restaurant quality.

Always ate my dad's homemade tomato soup and didn't think I'd find something better! But I did! And my son who cranes soup loved it! The roasted red pepper made this special. Just be careful as the onions can burn, make sure you leave them quartered

Now a weekly staple in my house. Great recipe. I have substituted just based on necessity, mainly I’ve done canned whole tomatoes in place of fresh. I omit the bell pepper because of an allergy. Still excellent.

I made recipe as directed except for milk instead of cream. I found it suite palatable but lacking in over all flavor. So for leftovers I did 2:1 red wine and cider vinegar, a healthy pinch of of more basil, Oregano, paprika and Worcestershire sauce. With some water and corn starch to thicken, it really made the recipe shine, bursting with flavors.

I will make this again. Only change I made was fresh parsley, pre minced garlic,  and omitted the salt and pepper on the tomatoes. Next time I will use low sodium chicken broth as some how it turned out a little salty.  It’s a great base to be able to adapt it to you likes/dislikes.

This is the second time I'm making this soup. I live in China and canned soups are almost unknown. However, fresh veggies are good and plentiful. I added two ounces of cream cheese for creaminess. I put it up in 1 liter mason jars and it stays well in the frig.

This was good, but WAY too much black pepper.  It was also a little thin consistency for our taste, I would reduce the broth by about a cup.

It didn’t have a strong tomato flavor so I added tomato paste which gave it more flavor and thickened it up.  Overall it was good but not as delicious as I had hoped. I’ll definately make it again and tweak for more flavor

This was such a good, simple soup.  Definitely need to roast the veggies as it suggests....adds something that I can't even describe to the overall richness.
First, I try to always make it like the recipe the first time, but didn't have all of the ingredients and it came out fabulous.
I used a combo of different tomatoes to make it 3 pounds
I used a LOT of fresh basil from my garden-way, way better than dried and fresh parsley from the store
I added maybe 1/2-3/4 cup of half and half
Used the whole roasted pepper
Tasted it all and decided that it would be too runny if I added broth so I ate it as it was.  Certainly, it made less soup but when I mentioned to my husband that I had left broth out he told me to PLEASE keep making it this way!

Made this tonight, so good. used homemade chicken stock with no salt, but didn't add the 5 cups. I maybe added 2 c. but used an emersion blender and herbs de Provicidinc and it soooo good. I think using organic tomatoes was the key.

Will make again. Lots of compliments. Used 4 cups vegetable stock instead of chicken broth. Used 1 can of drained whole tomatoes in addition to 3 lbs of Roma tomatoes. Cut fresh ground black pepper down to 1 TBSP. and it still had a bit of a kick.

Made this soup today, delicious.  I made it smooth using an immersion blender. Big hit here so will be making again. Thank you for your recipe.

The healthiest, most delicious tomato soup I believe my family and I have eaten - easy to make, but does take the full 1 hour from start to finish, served it with artisan bread YUM YUM

This soup is delicious comfort food. Once, I made it for my son as a home remedy for a cold. He's a very picky eater, but he liked this. I leave out the bell pepper to increase the tomato flavor. I just love this.

This is a recipe I'd make again and again. I did make a change. I used 1/2 chicken bone broth and I/2 vegetable broth. Added a very small roasted jalapeno to it. I also use this as a base for ricotta stuffed manicotti  topped with cheese.

Excellent recipe thank you Cindy!  Since I wanted a vegetarian version I skipped the chicken broth and used low fat milk.  You can change this up so many ways to suit your taste by adding cheese, herbs, etc.  The roasting of the tomatoes adds a fabulous flavor!  Will make this regularly!

Way too much pepper but I will plan to make again and add 1/2 to 1 tsp pepper next time. Other than that, I enjoyed a new way to use the abundance of tomatoes from my garden!

A little less broth next time. Too thin. Added some small pasta and chicken apple sausages to make it a whole meal in a bowl. Very tasty. Will make it a gain. Mostly home grown cherry tomatoes with a few Roma tomatoes from the store.

This soup was amazing! We made some changes that were based really on our preferences and what we currently are growing in our gardens.

First we used Roma, Champion and Golden Boy tomatoes. In addition, we used Sweet Walla Walla onions and fresh basil, also from the garden. After roasting the veggies, we transferred the sauce to our Lodge Enamel Cast Iron Pot, which by the way, is arguably one  of our favorite teams in our entire kitchen. I finally added about 3/4 cup of white wine for flavor and 1/2 cup of half & half to thicken it . 

My wife’s homemade sourdough bread was fresh out of the oven and paired perfectly with the soup.

It was unclear after pulverizing the tomatoes Do I dump the rest of the veggies in the soup? or pulverize them also . The recipe states to put the rest of the tomatoes in the blender. 
ALSO I added 1 Tablespoon of dried green chili powder and 1 poblano pepper for more depth of flavor. Before those adjustments it was meh.. acidy and just ok.

Nice, warm and comforting. I did use vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth . I put everything together in a saucepan after roasting and used an immersion blender just until slightly melded, as I like more texture in my soup.  Served with grated parmesan cheese on top.

I would use 4 cups chicken broth like one of the other reviewers and it was low salt and I didn't add extra salt.  I used my immersion blender and it worked fine.  I added about 1/3 cup of butter and it made it smoother.  I will use real basil another time and real parsley.  Used a red onion because I didn't have a yellow one  It didn't seem to make any difference.  I like a dollop of Greek yogurt on mine.

Definetly best tomato soup ever!!! it's my first time making tomato soup..I'm glad I chose this recipe! The roasted tomatoes and garlic With veggies sounded much tastier than just tomatoes and broth! I just added about a quarter cup or so of heavy cream to add a bit more creamy flavor and added a bit of shredded cheddar and parmesan !!yum!!!!

We were looking for a homemade tomato soup recipe and this was so good we have made it twice.  My husband loves this soup and so do I.  I have shared it with my daughters and recommended that they serve it to their families.  Especially good with a grilled cheese sandwich to dip in the soup.  True comfort food!

I used this a soup base, absolutely delicious.

Some things I changed:
I put canned navy beans warmed in chicken broth in the middle and put a small piece of tilapia on the beans so it looked as if the fish were floating on the soup.

I used half of the chicken stock and a quarter of the salt. Even though it's low-sodium stock it's still pretty salty.

Also I used twice as much flour (even with less broth) to thicken up the soup and I replaced the butter with three tablespoons of olive oil.

Oh, and I added two grilled jalapenos to the tomato roast mix to give it a nice spicy flavor.

Used 4 cups of  stock which gave the soup a slightly thicker texture as this is what we prefer. The second time I made it I added 1/4 tsp of chili powder and that added another dimension to the soup.  This recipe is really nice and easy to make. It's definitely a keeper.

Like others, I sprinkled tomato, pepper, onion mixture with cayenne, also doubled the garlic cloves and roasted for the full 45 minutes. 

Experimented with an immersion blender for one section of tomatoes, then switched to a Magic Bullet blender which produced creamier results. I think next time I'd use 4 cups of stock for a heavier soup. But this recipe is a KEEPER.

I like any soup so I thought this was a great way to use up the abundance of Roma tomatoes from the garden.  I followed the directions, but thought the soup needed to be strained to get rid of the tomato skins. While it was more pleasing without the skins, I didn't care for this soup.

Good base tomato soup. Could use additional flavors to go with the tomato.

OMG..never attempted a tomatoe soup but I must say this is absolutely  an excellent soup.  I made it for a serving for two only because this was my first attempt and not sure I would like it .  Well I must say this is a keeper.  I am always looking for good and easy soup recipes and next time I will follow direction for servings for six and share with family and friends...

Great tasting soup, and very easy to make. I have now made it a couple of times and it was lovey each time. Have used yellow and orange peppers - didn't make any difference. Also this last time chipped a half carrot that needed using up and roasted too  still tasted really tomatoey and got another veg into my kids ;) I also only use on the vine tomato, as long as it's still got a bit of a stalk attached; as favour starts to diminish once the stalk has been taken off.

Too long and too much heat to roast tomatoes and onions.  Cut back on broth per suggestions but  then it was too thick like sauce.

Very tasty soup! I adjusted it just a little bit to my own preferences, added more garlic and let it simmer for a couple of hours to improve texture.

This soup is just delicious. I chose to use organic vegetable broth because I wanted to keep the flavor all vegetarian. I also roasted the tomatoes, peppers, onion and garlic for 2 hours I figured the longer the roast the richer the flavor.  My husband commented this is the best tomato soup he had ever eaten. I used tomatoes from our garden and that just made the soup have an even fresher flavor. Tonight's dinner will consist of grilled cheese sandwiches and fresh, homemade roasted tomato soup. Can't wait till dinner yummmmm.

Excellent Soup!!!  

I took the advice of others and cut down the Chicken Broth to 4 cups. I added a couple more cloves of garlic.  Some of the vegetables got a little char on them, which added to the flavor.  It was a little more runny than I'd prefer, so I thickened it.  Overall it was a great recipe and will make it again!!!  Delicious!

Great simple recipe. I had tons of tomatoes from my garden this year and was looking for a healthy recipe to use them (without sacrificing taste!). 

I'm lazy and don't like washing too many dishes so I just tossed the roasted tomatoes in the pot of broth and used my immersion blender. 

I also didn't have parsley so I used some celery seed. 

The soup tasted the best day two after the flavours had lost of time to marry. I will definitely make this again.

Made this per the recipe and it was incredible! I used roasted chicken stock I had in the freeze which I'm sure added to the flavor. Also, I used roma's from my garden...bonus! Outstanding recipe!

Used a variety of tomatoes as available from garden - cherry to mid-sized.  Roasted with onion, red pepper, and garlic.  The tomatoes ended up charred, which gave them a rich flavor.  Those ingredients and the others can be added to the blender, according to taste.  Put tomatoes in blender, then added broth and other ingredients as desired.  Used fresh basil and parsley, as had it on hand.  Fabulous and easy.

I made this pretty much as written and it had a wonderful flavor. I did make a rue ( personal preference) and added a pinch of clove (about 3 whole cloves or 1/8 tsp.). Clove really makes the flavors pop. Will definitely make again.

This would be a pretty good recipe if you were going for gluten free and lactose free, but I thought it needed a roux (so I added one). I also kicked it up by adding a half teaspoon of chili flakes with the basil and sprinkled swiss cheese on top. My son thought it was too sweet still, but I like it.

I thought this recipe was really great! I love that it uses fresh tomatoes and not canned (we have tons from the garden right now). I also found it very easy. I used a whole red pepper but I thought it was too much and I will stick to the recipe next time and use a half. I also added a little bit of whipping cream because I had some in the fridge. It made it creamier but tasted great with or without it. I will definitely make this again.

I absolutely love this recipe!!! I just added more tomatos, a whole bell pepper & Peameal bacon ( For those Canadians ). It tasted amazing chopped up into the soup! The only problem is, my family wants me to make it all the time now.

Best tomato soup ever!!!  It is so hard to find a tomato soup that is made without cream.  I have made this soup so many times.  Thank you!

Perfect rustic tomato soup.  I just added little roux to thicken.  Dollop of sour cream on top.  Delicious.
