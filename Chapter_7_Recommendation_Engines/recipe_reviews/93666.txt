ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  Never thought I'd be one of those reviewers who would say "if I could give this 10 stars, I would"...but now I am!!! My only substitution was grilled chopped marinated chicken in place of the mushrooms. I used a whole wheat pita, fresh picked roma's and a sprinkling of shredded mozzarella after baking.  I've made *hundreds* of recipes from this site and this is now my favorite....so far ;)

I have been making variations on this for years.  Great with plain pesto; I use sundried tomatoes which are great, and often add artichokes and sweet red peppers too.  It's so quick and easy and always a hit, both as a meal and as an appetizer.  You can also make it with a tortilla base.  It helps to bake the base a few minutes before putting on the toppings.

I made this exactly according to the recipe (probably a first for me).  It turned out perfectly.  Everyone loved it - even the kids ate it, and didn't even pick off the mushrooms!

You really need to pile the spinach on - it will look quite high - but it wilts and condenses a lot.  

My only suggestion would be to change the name - something like "Grilled Flatbread with Spinach and Feta" has a cooler name that captures the Mediterranean feel of this recipe a lot better :)

We didn't have roasted tomato pesto, so we substituted regular pesto for it, and added bottled roasted tomatoes and it still came out great. Excellent recipe and very easy to make.

Delicious. The recipe doesn't tell you what to do with the tomatoes, so I just added them after the spinach but before the cheese. Go very heavy on the spinach; it shrinks up a lot!!

I have been making my own version of these for years, love them! I put the pita in the oven first for about 5 minutes before topping, helps to keep crispy! I take all of the ingredients and mix them together in a bowl then top the pita, keeps everything from falling off. I always add fresh basil, lemon juice, red pepper flake and top after cooking with parmesan! So good!

Loved them!  I had to use regular pesto and could only get onion pitas--bad day at the grocery store.  We ate these for dinner and agreed they're a definite make again.  There's room for a lot of experimentation, too.  If you turn the pitas upside down, it makes a little bowl that helps to keep all the toppings in.  Makes the crust crispy, too.

I used 5 pieces of whole wheat flat bread instead of pita bread.  The bake time was just a little less.  I thought they were a bit rich but still great!  Use less of the sun-dried tomato pesto and a little less feta if you don't want them so rich.  Great lunch with a side of fruit or as just a appetizer!

I only had half a jar of sun-dried tomato pesto so I made some with that and some with regular pesto.  Awesome either way but the sun dried tomato stuff turned out way better.  I also omitted the mushrooms because it just didn't sound too good.  Regardless, an awesome recipe that I will definitely be making again.  My roommate and I both loved it!

These came out very well! I didn't modify them much at all, sticking to the straight recipe except for throwing on a little extra shredded romano I had laying around. For 5 minute 'pizzas' they were definitely a crowd-pleaser, eaten up by a table of hungry guys in a hurry.

I made this with regular pesto but used all the ingredients that it said to use. To me it was too bland, definitely needs more spices and salt!

This is sooo good! I havent been able to find peta bread so I have been using sourdough english muffins and they work really well. I have had trouble finding tomato pesto also so I have used tomato bruchetta and prego spaghetti sauce and both have worked out just as good. I also add goat cheese if I have it. This is a great quick lunch or dinner. Perfect to have kids make too!

Love it! It's become a regular. I prefer the basil pesto and goat cheese. Chopping spinach makes it easier to bite into, but harder to stack ingredients. I also cut out the oil and it turns out fine. Definitely not a full meal, but perfect for a light lunch or served with heavier sides. 

Made bite-sized on miniature pitas from Trader Joe's (about 2" diameter). Served for bridal shower - wildly popular.

Five stars for quick, easy and delicious!  This was a great summer night meal.  I used tortillas because I had them on hand.  They crisped up nicely on the edges, but it would be good to cook them alone first to crisp the entire thing before adding the toppings.  Thanks for sharing!  

Update:  I made these again using whole wheat Mediterranean flat bread and that was much better!  This is good with goat cheese also and fresh basil.  Yum!  Love this.

FANTASTIC as written---but if you add oregano and onion--OUT of this world.  My husband literally said "it was better than the moment we got married." I think he was in the mood for hyperbole that night, but still.  Stop what you're doing and make it now.

Excellent! I didn't have mushrooms and used regular jarred pesto sauce instead of the tomato one. Also, no need to drizzle with oil, as the pesto already has olive oil in it. Very tasty. Served these with a grilled chicken sausage and fresh fruit...great meal!

These were awesome!  I used the mini pitas and they were perfect!  I also forgot to add the olive oil and they still tasted great!  This is a great light lunch and I will definitely be making them again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous! We love making these and usually make them just as the recipe states we do sometimes ad kalamata olives though, we just love the flavor of the olives with the feta.

Made this for my family and it was very tasty. Decided to use homemade pizza dough instead of the pita and my family liked it better than my regular pizza and it was healthier

would give this 4 and a 1/2 if I could! this recipe is so quick and easy and I've made it several times since I found it--sometimes for a fast lunch on the weekends! the sundried tom pesto is a nice change from tomato sauce and the pitas really bake up nicely like a crust! I've tried it with goat cheese instead of feta (less caloric value) and it has been very tasty every time!

This is by far one of the best recipes from this site! If you haven't made it yet you need to! I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was a hit with all who tried-and it is sooooo easy to make. I can't wait to host a luncheon just so I can serve this. The oil can be omitted to cut back on fat a little. SOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was really good, BUT not really enough for a meal, I have a family of 4 and they were still hungry, my finicky 5 year old at 2 of them. Thats a plus when she eats what we eat. Made just as it was written, turned out delicious. Next time I will double the recipe, I have a hungry family . Thanks for the recipe

I loved this recipe!  I used feta instead of cheddar cheese and added a couple cloves of fresh garlic to the spinach mixture.  I've made it several times.  I've taken the leftovers to work for lunch and a couple of co-workers asked for the recipe.  They also enjoyed this dish.

This is so easy and so good! I didn't use mushrooms since my boys wouldn't like them. They came out crispy on the edges and my 2 yr. old twins loved them. Will definitely become a standard!

Really good!   I try to have pita, pesto, feta, and parmesan on hand, and you can add any other toppings you want. Jarred roasted red peppers work well. The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly. I no longer use the drizzle of olive oil as there seems to be plenty of oil in the pesto. It's a quick easy supper with a bowl of soup or a salad.

This was awesome!  I couldn't find "tomato pesto," so I used a jar of "tomato bruschetta" spread, which was wonderful!  Since it had chunk tomatoes and had lots of olive oil, I omitted the roma tomatoes and olive oil on top.  Next time, I will use my olive oil spritzer, and add a spritz on top, so that the spinach wilts some.  I topped mine with grilled chicken breast slices to make a meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

soooo good!! i devoured this for dinner tonight.  i did make a few subtle changes, using regular pesto instead of sun-dried tomato, used a flatbread instead of pita, and mixed the mushrooms (gross!! :))  i also didn't drizzle with olive oil.  it was amazing.  i used fresh tomatoes from my garden and fresh spinach, and it just tasted so FRESH!  and GOOD!  what else is there to say?  thanks!  :)

Easy to make and really tasty. I followed the recipe but also added chopped roasted zucchini, squash and lemon basil. I also used reduced fat feta and drizzled blasamic vinegar just before serving. I think I'll saute garlic with the spinich a bit before topping and baking next time. Such a light and delicious meal!

Yes, this is absolutely fabulous!  My wife and I tried it with chicken, but the original version stands all by itself.  It stands alone as a meal.  Fantastic!

I liked this and that it was so quick to throw together. I used some flat bread, that I had made and was already in the freezer. I used all of the ingredients but left out the sun dried tomatoes, as I am not a big fan of them. I just used a little more tomato. I cut the recipe in half and still ended up with enough topping for nearly 5. I thought it was going to taste like a pizza, but it was more like a salad on a crispy warm bread. Interesting combination.

So simple and delicious.  When I have the ingredients at the house I tend to make this for days in a row.  I add some extra garlic and use regular pesto but otherwise this is perfect.

This was really good.  I expected it to taste "healthier," but instead it will be one of the recipes used for "Pizza Thursdays" at our house.  I use fat free or low-fat feta (whichever is on sale) and make my own sun-dried tomato pesto from another recipe on this site (doesn't really matter what pesto you use as long as it's garlicky and tastes good).  Highly recommend.

Absolutely incredible! I couldn't find sun-dried tomato pesto, so I used regular pesto and added sun-dried tomatoes. I also added some diced red onion and red pepper and they went great with the other flavours. I'll make this one again and again.

AMAZING!  What a nice change for dinner.  So light - you are satisfied, but not so full you are uncomfortable.  I added artichokes because we love them.  That is the only thing I changed.  Will make again - for sure!!

Made exactly as recipe indicates, including some tasty sun-dried tomato pesto.  Classic Italian-ish taste with the feta, evoo, etc.  I prefer doughy crusts overall with pizza dishes, yet very much enjoyed the crunchiness of the pita.  This is on the Keeper list.

This recipe is awesome! Quick, tasty and easy to make. I made it for my impatiently hungry husband, and he asked me to make it again the next day! I followed the recipe exactly (keep the tomato pesto) and it turned out great!

Outstanding!!! Followed the recipe exactly. I did mix all of the ingredients in a bowl and baked pitas for 5 minutes before topping the pitas with the mixture. Don't miss out on making this!!!
Update: Now when I make this recipe, I omit the pesto. I just slice wheat pitas in half and stuff each side with the rest of the ingredients and top off with tzatziki sauce (DEBNJAMES - Tzatziki recipe). Easier and very tasty.

I LOVED this! I left off the mushrooms (can't stand 'em), and I didn't chop the spinach, just kept the leaves whole. It was my first experience with sun-dried tomato pesto; I'm not sure how I felt about it. I liked it, but I would probably use less next time, and up the spinach and tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe, Heatherbee!

This recipe immediately made it into our regular rotation.  We make it as-is and I wouldn't change a thing!  Tonight we made it on whole wheat Naan bread because that's what we had in the house.  It was just as delicious as the pita bread.  My one-year old gobbles up the spinach and tomatoes when we serve this.

I REALLY liked this! It is so versatile - just like with a pizza, you can pick and choose what you want to top it with. I made this for lunch and for dinner several times recently and it was so delicious. Great, quick and easy meal.

This was a great base for a recipe. I did add garlic, red onions and subbed sun-dried tomatoes instead of roma which I think really made the dish. I wish there was a way to give 4 1/2 stars because it is a great recipe, but I changed it a bit that I have to go with 4. I also added chicken to make it a complete meal but without the chicken would be just as good. Thanks!

I made these last night and was very happy with the results.  They were super easy to make and a healthful meal to boot.  I made them with basil pesto not sun-dried tomato pesto as I mis-read the recipe while shopping.  I also used larger pitas that were on the thin side to make it more like a small pizza.  It was delicious.  Next time I will try the SDT pesto, I am sure it will be wonderful.  Thanks for the great and quick recipe!

I love this recipe. I could not find sundried tomato pesto, so I used sundried tomato bruschetta. I don't know if there is a real difference, but everyone loved this including my 5 year old daughter who can be finicky. I will be adding this to my rotation. Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe! Fresh ingredients, good for you, all of it! I did without the additional olive oil as the pesto and the cheeses more than made up for it. Big hit with the parents, with tastes that are not part of their usual repertoire.

We really enjoyed these. They are simple, tasty, and you can dress them however you'd like.  We had to bake them longer than suggested, but that may be due to the amount of toppings we added.

Very good! I did add some chicken cooked in EVOO to it, though. Very tasty.

REALLY delicious!!  Two of these filled one hungry stomach, so this could easily feed 2-3 for dinner.  I found that cooking directly on the oven rack made the pita much crispier than a cookie sheet.  Quick, easy, healthy, and very, very tasty...a new favorite!

This was fabulous! I served it for dinner, at the last 5 mins of the cooking time I added slices of precooked chicken breast seasoned with greek seasoning. It was hard with all the toppings on, but definitely worth every bite! Would be great as a light lunch. I utilized basil pesto instead of tomato pesto.

DH and I had this for dinner tonight.  It was awesome!  I followed the directions exactly.  Can't wait to try it with different veggies and cheeses!  We're definitely adding this to the weekly rotation.

This was so good! So simple and quick! And I am just one person, so I made just one in the toaster oven and it turned out perfectly :-) Will definitely keep this in mind and make variations on it too. Love the idea

YUM!  I didn't do the mushrooms, the family isn't fans... but wish I did them on mine!  I prebaked the pitas for about 7 minutes, then added all as written.   Cooked about ten minutes, then added fresh cut basil and mozzarella (just a sprinkle) and put back into the still warm but off oven until mozzarella melted.  I think we are making these again tomorrow for lunch with our leftover ingredients!!!

This recipe was so easy and yummy! My husband loved it too. I am college student on a budget, so I am always looking for cheap, easy, and healthy (that is always a plus!)

I baked a few chicken tenderloins with balsamic vinegar and pepper before I made the pita. I chopped it and added it to the pita. I also chopped up some yellow peppers I had that I needed to use up.  

I would just mention that 12 minutes definitely make the crust crispy. I prefer the crust a little softer & baked a second batch for about 7 or 8 minutes and that was perfect.

Wow.  I'm trying to lose weight and haven't eaten pizza in months, I was so excited to try this.  I made some adjustments based on what I had on hand... I used regular pesto as a base, then chopped fresh spinach, then some leftover fra diavolo sauce I had with ground beef, topped with the feta and also some Monterey Jack.  I thoroughly enjoyed mine and Fiance ate three.

Very tasty and super quick!  I used regular pesto, because it's what I had.  The only thing I would do different is probably add some shredded Italian on top of everything, to help everything stay together better.  It was kind of humorous to eat because everything was falling off.  So delish though.  My husband loved them and my daughter also ate them without complaining (too much).

very tasty. Any type of bread can work for this. Instead of pesto I like to spread hummus on the pita before topping with other ingredients.

Loved this recipe! I always liked feta cheese put was hesitant to use it at home. I tweeked the recipe a little bit and added goat cheese to the mix as well. I tried the pita bake with spinach and also made it with mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes. DELISH!

I love making this for dinner or for a snack.. its one of those things thats really good warm, but still really good cold the next day.  The only thing i do different is leave out the olive oil because the pesto is already pretty greasy and I add red peppers and onions

OMG!  This recipe was a BIG hit at my dinner party last night.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I made this as an appertiser and sliced the pita breads like I would a pizza.  The only change I made to this recipe was to use basil pesto because I could not find the sun-dried tomato pesto.  Will definitely be make this again.

! ! ! Part of the success of this recipe I'm sure has to do with quality/yumminess of your ingredients. I used Giada's recipe for sundried tomato pesto (she made it to go with penne pasta) but it worked exceptionally well for this! (Google her recipe!!) Anyhow, we made this on wheat pizza dough, added lots of spinach, didn't use the parm, oil or black pepper...didn't see it as necessary with everything else so why add the fat/calories. Love this!! Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

It was very delicious. If you want to cut back on fat, eliminate the pesto & olive oil and instead put a dash of balsamic vinegar at the end.

I was grocery shopping and forgot to bring my ingredients for this,  so I winged it.  I used basil pesto, spinach, sundried tomatos, feta and black olives to make my pizzas on Pita of course.  OH MY GOSH this is great.  Much better than I expected.  Even my husband who does not like feta loves these.   Awesome recipe,  great flexibility.  LOVE IT!!

This was a big hit with my daughter and I liked that it was so easy and quick to make. I used red pepper instead of the tomato and only baked them for 10 minutes as I didn't want them to be too crunchy. Thanks for sharing Heatherbee.

These delightful little snacks were sooo scrumptious and super easy! I used plain pesto instead of the sun dried tomato pesto but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I love the versatility of this dish, it really can be anything you want it to be. I served this pizza like creation with a huge green salad for dinner, it was perfect for a quick meal! I could see getting creative with the sauces and toppings too! I will surely make this again.

So delicious and easy!  The sun-dried tomato spread makes it a bit oily so I didn't add it at the end the second time around.  Perfect for a quick lunch!

OUTSTANDING!!! My husband missed having no "meat",so next time I will add some chopped chicken to his, but this recipe is FABULOUS as is!  I added oregano, basil and parm to the pesto before spreading. I also added sliced onions, in addition to the spinach, mush, and tomatos. I sprinkled the top with basil, parm and black pepper and then topped with feta. Drizzled a little EVOO over top before baking. YUMMY!!! One of my new favorites.  BTW, my 14 month old didn't really like this--not very little kid friendly, but GREAT for older kids/adults.

Amazing! You can make this with so many different veggie combinations - I recently made these as an appetizer for a gathering- rave reviews! I used a creamy israeli feta cheese- very good! This recipe is so easy and yummy- I will be making again and again!

I really loved this one.  I pretty much followed the recipe- just adjusting it slightly to make it healthier.  I piled on the veggies.  Then I used reduced fat pesto and reduced fat feta cheese.  I used a little less than what was called for for the pesto and olive oil.  It was an easy meal to size down for 1 person and it was very filling.  I will definitely be making this again soon- maybe even next week!

Wow, this recipe is awesome! My husband loved it! Which is amazing because it's so hard to get him to eat anything even remotely healthy.  This recipe is great how it is, which is why I gave it 5 stars, however I highly recommend adding grilled chicken like others suggested. I don't have a grill at the moment but I did cook a couple chicken breast in the skillet with a tabelspoon of butter and added it on top. Other then that I really didn't alter anything else.. and it was great!

We loved this! Our grocery stores don't carry sun-dried tomato pesto so I used the Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto recipe on this site. The whole thing was super easy, fast, and colorful! Next time I'm going to make it a bit healthier with low-fat feta cheese and add a few more veggies. Even my two year old liked it, and she's definitely going through a hate all new foods phase.

This was good. I did add artichokes and some mozzarella cheese. I didn't have pesto so I used bruschetta spread instead. Probably  not the best idea... not as much flavor. But it was still great.

As this was baking, the aroma that filled  our home was irresistible!!  It was also such a cinch to make, the finished product was on the table in less than 30 minutes. This would make a great appetizer and party pleaser.We would defnitely make this again with no changes!!

Great for a weekend vegetarian lunch. I used a fresh whole wheat pizza crust instead of the pitas. We thinly sliced a quarter of a small red onion and used up a few tablespoons of sliced black olives and placed on half the pizza & that side was really good too!

Very quick and easy. I followed the recipe exactly. My kids loved it. I made it again a few days later with the leftover vegetables. Didn't have anymore pesto so used pizza sauce & mozarella for the kids along with all the veggies. They loved it all the same and I got the pesto/feta pita for myself!

This was a huge hit at a dinner party - it's very colorful and presents nicely.  I made mine with homemade parsley pesto and it was outstanding.

The original recipe was a great base to start with.  I made several variations, however.  I first sateed 3 cloves garlic, 1 onion, salt, pepper, parsley and basil for a few minutes in olive oil.  Then, I added 1 can of artichoke hearts, spinach, and diced tomato.  I sateed all of that for about 5 minutes.  While waiting for that to finish up, I glazed the tops of my pita bread with a sun dried tomato "pesto" that I bought at my local grocery store.  It was in a jar and could be used as a dip or for other things that require a kick of goodness.  I dusted the tops of the pitas with feta cheese and then put my veggie satee mixture on top of the pita breads.  I put them in the oven for 8 minutes and before serving, I put a table spoon of feta cheese on top!  VERY GOOD!!!!!!

This is pretty good. I love the toppings with all fresh ingredients I don't have to feel too guilty eating it. The pita does come out a little soggy towards the center though. Perhaps I will make again with a reviewers suggestion of baking the pita a bit before hand. I also will try this on flat bread to see if that makes a difference. Overall very good!

Great combination of veggies to compliment the feta cheese. My problem was that the pesto made it kind of oily and when I cut it into pieces the toppings were a little messy. -this could have been my fault for piling them high, figuring the spinach would wilt more than it did. So it fell apart a bit. But still tasted delicious.

This was pretty good and easy.  The sundried tomato pesto was a bit overpowering for my taste.  I think next time I will use regular pesto and just add a few sundried tomatoes on top.  And add some mozzerella cheese too.

DELISH!!  No additions needed (I use basil pesto).  I baked mine on my pizza stone and added a few more minutes to the baking time for an extra crispy crust.  Thanks for sharing your recipe....LOVED IT!!!

Fabulous! The sun dried tomatoes with the pesto is a nice touch. I added a little chicken on the top too, but great without.

One of the best recipes I have tried in a long time!!!

Amazing and quick. I needed a quick appetizer and didn't have any feta or mushrooms, so I substitued fresh mozzerella and added dried basil and sliced olives. I used mini pitas so they were individual servings.  They were the hit of the night!

Wow!  The whole family of picky eaters absolutely loved it!  There was a fight for the last pita.  I will make it again, which doesn't happen too often, and would like to try and make my own sundried tomato pesto.  I am also thinking of arugula and caramelized onions next time.

I used basil pesto and canned tomatoes, cooked it about 10 minutes longer for the mushrooms and for the cheese to melt. It was very good, I will be making it again, very easy!  But, I won't be adding the pepper at the end.

This was kind of a miss for us.  It ended up being really soggy, despite not using extra oil and cooking it on a pizza stone. It had potential, but I wouldn’t use pita bread next time.

The only change, if you can call it that, was I already had sundried  tomatoes in oil and a jar of pesto,  I didn't have sundried tomato pesto so I just mixed those two together. I also chopped the SD tomatoes. Since there was enough oil from the SD tomatoes I didn't add more oil to it.
I agree that you need to add a lot of spinach. I also had square pita bread and I didn't split them since I always end up tearing them. I cut them in half when they were done. I also topped it with more parmesan before I baked it. Very good!

Great recipe.  Added grilled chicken and artichoke hearts.  Great quick dinner with ingredients we had a home.  Easy to customize and kid friendly.  They got to put on their own toppings so felt like they made their ow.

This was quick and easy to make and tasted DELICIOUS!!!  I do not like mushrooms, so I left it off my pita, but my husband even loved it on his.  I think next time I might add some onions to the mix.

This recipe is so easy, and so good! I recommend making more than you think you'll want—my husband and I were wishing we had more! I substituted the tomato pesto for regular pesto, and it was delicious.

Pretty good for the most part, but didn't really blow my mind. (I am changing my review and giving it three stars, just because I really can't find the desire to make it again.) I think next time, if I make it again, I'll add some marinated chicken, more parmesan and feta, maybe some roasted garlic and oven roasted tomatoes with sauce. I will also probably try some of my Konriko Greek seasoning and oregano, also. I followed the recipe mostly to a 'T' this time, aside from adding some minced garlic, but will adjust to taste in the future! We used store bought pitas this time, only due to we're in temporary housing and I don't have my Kitchen Aid, but will make homemade pitas next time. This is a good recipe for cooks who like to play around and adjust to their own preference, but wouldn't recommend to those who are built to follow recipes or new cooks.

Incredible!!! Made exactly as directed with this exception: After adding pesto sauce to pita I mix all other ingredients together (including salt n pepper) and then layer on pita. Then drizzle olive oil in top. Less mess. Deff making this again!

I made this with regular pesto since I didn't have sun dried and topped it with grape tomatoes and sun dried and the rest of the ingredients it called for.It was very delicious. I wasn't sure how the spinach was going to come out on baking it on the pita but it made it slightly crunchy and could barely taste it with the pesto and cheese anyways. Even my husband that is fussy about vegetables and hates eating them and sometimes refuses to found this meal enjoyable. I'll be adding it to something we can make instead of pepperoni pizza it's a lot healthier.

This was ok for a quick weeknight dinner.  Next time, I think I'll try it with refrigerated whole wheat pizza dough.  This isn't any fault to the recipe, I just found it hard to crisp up the pita's to my desired crispiness and I found that I really prefer a thinner crust.  But if you like thick - you'll like this.  The rest of the dish was really good.

I prepared this using regular basil pesto, as I had made some a few days beforehand and wanted to use it up.  I used Greek pocket-less pitas. What a great weekend lunch!  So easy, and yet tasted excellent.  I especially like the potential for versatility for this recipe.  Yummy!

These were out of this world good. Waaaay better than I expected them to be. Have to buy the good thick pita's. I also drizzled peanut oil on them before baking. Amazing.

Made this recipe with naan instead of pitas. It still tasted amazing but we had to fold like a taco in order to eat it. Neither one of us like mushrooms so we left those out and added chopped turkey. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Made this delicious pita on a 'meatless meal' night for dinner.  I added a little diced onion in place of the mushrooms.  I loved the ease and quickness of putting dinner on the table with this recipe.  Added a tossed salad and some fresh fruit and dinner was done.  Great recipe that I will use again.

As other people are saying. If you cook down the spinach beforehand, along with the mushrooms and some oil, then put the mixture on the pita and toss it in the oven...  It is amazing!

It's a very nice recipe. But it does require more veggies(quantity) than what's stated. I did add more of mushrooms,spinach, tomatoes & tad more feta cheese.Also most importantly "the baking time is 10min additional to the stated12min. &that too using middle rack, else the whole thing would be just heated up & the veggies would taste like raw salad".So my advice use middle rack & add additional 10min if u don't want to taste heated up raw salad. Also I made it with "whole wheat pita bread"& "sun dried tomato pesto (no-nuts)" both from this website.

This is an excellent fast dinner. It's just what I like. No meat...lots of veggies...and some cheese. It's a very adaptable recipe so really the toppings could be whatever one wishes. Thanks for sharing this dinner idea!

I had reservations about whether all of my family had a "mature palate" for this flavor combination.  No worries!  The tomato hater only lessened the quantity. The spinach haters didn't mind at all. Everyone said they liked it & would eat it again. Per another review I subbed chicken (pre-cooked on the grill) for mushrooms. Only one large breast was enough for 4 pitas.  ($$ saving!)  Definitely will add this to our recipe box & make again.

These are pretty good, and certainly fast and easy to make. I used basil pesto, since we aren't too fond of sundried tomatoes, and whole wheat pitas, but other than  that, I followed the recipe.Thanks!

I have made this at least a dozen times and its a wonderful light meal. Very nice in the summer time with the fresh tomatoes from the garden.  I like setting out the toppings and letting everyone build their own mini pizzas how they like.

I made this in a pizza, I used Freschetta Artisan pizza crust thin. I added a little shredded mozzarella cheese, I used half of the ingredients for one pizza. It came out delightful. This will be a regular dish, now if only I could trick my little boys into trying it.

Great light summer meal or snack.  Next time, I might sprinkle a bit of cheese under the spinach because it kept sliding off of the pita.  Overall, very good.

So good and easy!  I couldn't find sun-dried tomato pesto, so I just put down a light layer of tomato sauce, and then spread a layer of regular basil pesto, mixing the two. I added a little more tomatoes and mushrooms, and used Trader Joe's 21 season salute at the end instead of pepper.  It was excellent.

Delicious! Very easy for a beginner like myself. Changes I made: left out mushrooms (don't like mushrooms) and sauteed garlic/spinach/leftover cooked chicken in some of oil from the sundried tomato pesto sauce before adding it to the pita. I baked one pita pizza for 12 minutes just to test it out and it was perfectly crunchy. Great recipe for those that like thin, crispy type pizzas.

This is a weekly staple at my house. The pesto rather than boring pizza sauce and the Feta is what takes this from same old pizza gig to something "gourmet " and rich with flavor. The way I make it, it's about 180 calories per pizza so is a filling dinner that helps keep calories at bay. I use those 50 calorie wheat flat breads, the sundried tomato pesto, a few slices of turkey pepperoni, LOTS of chopped spinach, a sprinkle of feta and parm, skip the olive oil (its not needed) shot of pepper and in the oven. I usually eat two of them with some fruit and I'm full.

These are fantastic. I was even able to make them as an easy, healthy and tasty lunch option by putting them in the toaster over for 2 minutes or the microwave for 45 seconds. 
Easy to add extra veggies too. Zuccini was very good on this too.

This is delicious! I made my own Pita Bread using a recipe from this site and found it much better since I could put the toppings on the raw dough and bake it to golden brown. I used cherry tomatoes instead of romas because that's what I had and plain homemade pesto. I omitted the parmesan because I was all out but I'm sure with it would be great too. Once out of the oven I drizzled it with homemade tzatziki. To die for! Simple but so good! I feel like you could add anything you want on top (olives, chicken, etc) and it would be fantastic.

Awesome recipe!!! I made it last night.  I followed the exact recipe, except I added cooked chicken.  So flavorful and light. My kids ate it all up and they are hard to please! They asked for it again tonight.  I will be adding steak this time.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!!

This was an excellent family dinner. My 7 year old helped to make it and he liked it too. I wasn't able to find pesto at my local supermarket so I chopped fresh basil. Next time I think I will hold the drizzle of olive oil & black pepper until after the pitas are baked for added flavor.

This was pretty good!  It came out a little salty for me with all that cheese, but it was still pretty delicious. Take care in choosing a good sun-dried tomato pesto too, as that could easily dominate the flavor in this recipe. It's also a little hard to eat with everything falling off when you pick it up, but it's worth the mess. :-)

Delicious!! We loved it. I didn't have roma tomatoes so I chopped a regular tomato. Added a bit of dried chilies before serving.

These are really good. We have made these several times and varied the recipe, but the recipe as written is the best.

This was absolutely delicious!  One of the very best dinners I've made from the website.  I highly recommend trying this. No modifications necessary.

Deliciaso! I used plain pesto (basil and garlic) I picked up at Safeway. Could've used a little less of it but it was a quick, easy, and healthy dinner. Tip: Don't let pesto dominate the flavor! Try flat bread if you're not a fan of pita bread. Also you can substitute fresh basil leaves if you don't have spinach.

These were really good. I would recommend that you pay attention to how much olive oil you use - the pesto/sun-dried tomatoes were packed in olive oil as well so it made the pita a bit soggy. These are quick and versatile.

Delish! I've also subbed gorgonzola and even goat cheese depending on what was in the fridge, and it was great both ways. Added whatever veggies were on hand and voila! Instant snack. They freeze beautifully as well, and re-heat perfectly. Thanks!

After the first bite, I wasn't too sure about it. After the third bite, I was totally sold! It is delicious! But very rich. I would definitely keep this to an appetizer rather than a meal because of it's richness. This ones a keeper!

Great recipe!  My family did not like the sun-dried tomato pesto, it seemed to overpower the other flavors.  I made it a second time with just pesto sauce, and it was perfect for us!

YUM!  I love the blend of flavors in this recipe.  The feta and pesto make the pizza much more flavorful than the usual tomato sauce and mozz cheese pizzas.  You can also be creative with toppings.  In addition to the ingredients mentioned, I also used chopped black olives and artichokes, because I love both.  Oh and I took the advice of another reviewer and baked the pitas for a few minutes before adding the toppings, to make them a little crispier.  Thanks, Heatherbee, for a great recipe!

This was awesome!!! My whole family loved it.  The pesto is what gives it a great flavor.  I added red onion to it.  I also use the whole wheat pita pocket and cut in half so it was so thick.

A tasty little concoction excluding the rather bland taste & texture of the pita bread.  While easy to make as instructed, next time I'll find an alternate to the pita bread.

Excellent, and easy to make.  I used sweet peppers as suggested instead of mushrooms.  I also added a little mozarella cheese.  Delicious!  The olive oil really adds a little somthing!

We loved this.  We founf it was great for a dinner, and we each only had 1 of the pitas. The only change I made was in the pesto.  I couldnt finf sundried tomato pesto, so I added 1/2 jar of regular pesto to some tomato sauce I had. Delicious.  i also cooked a little longer.

WOW WOW WOW! My boyfriend and I both loved this recipe!!! The pitas were delicious! I did use canned spinach because that is what I had on hand. Do not substitute for the pesto... it is worth the extra money to follow this recipe! This is my favorite recipe from this website so far!

I didn't make it exactly since I didn't have all the ingredients. I have a ethnic grocery store nearby so I used some red pepper/eggplant pesto that I had on hand and bought some fresh pita bread for them also. Huge difference in taste from the pits you get at your local deli grocery section. I also only had romano cheese but that was fine taste wise.   I was surprised that the feta taste wasn't as strong as I had hoped since its one of our fav cheeses but mention this that if you hate feta don't be put off because it was not an overpowering feta taste like you would expect.  Next time I will put more spinach on and maybe omit the olive oil. I made half with the addition of sliced greek olives and diced green onions and everyone raved the ones with these were even better.  Very visually appealing and would also make a great appetizer or a main meal. Always on the lookout for healthier fast cooking recipes and this one will go into the rotation.  I did have to cook it about 15 minutes and turned heat up to 400 to crisp it up.

I had been doing a version of this for years.  This is such a great and versatile recipe.  I add a  thin layer of fat-free cream cheese for additional creaminess, sun dried tomatoes, pepperoncinis, kalamata olives, feta and red onion.  YUM!!!

This is quite good, but you've got to have a tasty pesto sauce.  I tried it with Sacla from Fresh Market, and it was yummy.  I tried it with a pesto sauce from Whole Foods, and it tasted like dog food.  All about the pesto sauce.  Skipped mushrooms, added grilled chicken and moz cheese.  Yummy, easy, and nutritious.

I loved this but since i did not write down or print out the recipe I used what i had at home with the only additional purchase of the bread of which i used whole wheat flatbread instead. I went by my memory for what to put on it. I used regular prepared purchased pesto, chopped up sundried tomatoes (not in oil), artichoke hearts, mushrooms, baby spinach and feta cheese. My husband loved it so much he went back for seconds which was a major feat being that if a meal doesn't have meat in it he calls it a "snack". this was very filling and on the taste buds very satisfying. We will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!!

I went to two grocery stores and couldn't find the tomato pesto.  I mixed together a 6oz can of "Tomato Paste with Tomato Pesto" with half a packet of Knorr pesto sauce mix and some water and divided it between the pitas.  It was too strong so I think I would use a thinner layer of my mixture and just toss the rest.  The feta wasn't very obvious but that is likely due to my paste/pesto.  I baked the pitas a for a few minutes before and otherwise followed the directions.  The only other difference was changing the order of the ingredients - pesto, feta, parm, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms so that all the feta doesn't fall off the top but I do think the presentation is better when you can see the feta.  I would get 5 or 6 mushrooms next time too.  Might make again.

Loved this and so did my husband.  It's similar to the classic Greek Spinach Pie (spanakopita), but is much easier and less time consuming.

This is excellent!  I have made it many times exactly as is.  Have also made it using pizza dough, and that is also great.  Thanks for the terrific recipe.

I have made this several times now and I love it! My husband and i love pizza but are watching our calories and this recipe satisfies our craving for pizza without busting your calorie intake for the day!!! The only problem I have is I can't always find the whole wheat pitas, my store always sells out of them quickly, otherwise I would make them even more!! Also very quick to make! Thanks for an excellent recipe.

These were really good and my husband loved them. I omitted mushrooms because I don't like them and I added chicken for my husband who has to have meat with every meal. Every time I make these I make them a little different. Usually I add garlic, basil and oregano as well as extra olive oil. This recipe is a keeper.

Simply delicious, especially given the easy preparation. I stick to the recipe with a few differences. I use fluffy pitas from a local bakery company, along with standard pesto from a market deli as a sauce, and I like using Rosso Bruno tomatoes. To top it off, I shave pieces of imported parmigiano reggiano onto the pizza. This recipe goes well beyond satisfying... it's fantastic.

great!  I couldn't find sun dried tomato paste at my grocery store so I bought a jar of sun dried tomatoes and stuck them in the food processor along with some tomato paste I had in the fridge.  I also added roasted garlic and green olives to the pizza

These are awesome! I have made these twice with fantastic results. Tonight I used lavish bread in place of the pita and I loved how the edges came to a wonderful crisp in the oven! I didn't have any roma tomatoes on hand, but I did have a package of sun-dried tomato pieces, so I used those in place of fresh. I also do not drizzle oil over the top (to save on fat), but its still delicious anyway!!

Delicious!  One pita kept me full for hours.  I used frozen spinach instead and grape tomatoes. The grape tomatoes are a lot easier to cut (I think) and makes the dish look really pretty.  Will make again!!!

This was a really yummy recipe. The only thing that I didn't like on top of the pita was the sun-dried tomatoes. Otherwise, everything else worked like a charm. In fact, we added chunks of chicken to our pitas. YUM!

Pretty simple, fast, and delicious. Because I couldn't find pita bread at the grocery store that day I used little wheat "sandwich thins" instead, which turned out to have an amazing texture and soak in the pesto very well. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and so easy to make! I added pitted kalamata olives and capers. My kids loved them too! (without the olives and capers for them).  It has been a great snack for them (6 and 9 y/o)when they come home from school.

My boyfriend's Mom (who is vegetarian) came over unexpectedly so I made this so she could eat dinner with us.  OMG, how wonderful!  I took the advice of another and put the pita bread in the over for a few minutes first  before putting on the pesto & toppings.  I didn't have red pesto so I added some tomato paste to regular pesto and it was so flavorful!  I sprinkled a tad of salt over the tomatoes too but I think next time I may used canned diced tomatoes for more flavor since they are not in season.  Everyone raved over these little pizzas!  Can't wait to make for an appetizer and make wedges/chips!!!!!

I would definitely make this again! I used sun-dried tomato pesto already made from stop & shop (you can find them in the deli section where they keep the fresh cheeses) I didn't add the mushroom since I don't like them too much, and I added some chopped sun-dried tomato with olive oil. I left it in the oven for about 20-30 mins. I thought it'll come out soggy from the olive oil but the bread came out nice and crisp. My kids love them too.

Besides this recipe being delicious, it is absolutely wonderful if you have a child.  I give my 20 month old daughter veggies every night for dinner and she rarely eats them.  She absolutely loved these mini pizzas!!  It was wonderful watching her eat mushrooms, tomatoes, and spinach willingly!

It has to be really good for me to give 5 stars.  This was delicious and the family LOVED it.  The only thing I did different was put all the ingredients in a bowl (except the pesto) and mixed it with the oil.  I wanted to make sure the toppings got an even amount of oil.  I also topped half of them with chicken for my husband.  I used the frozen Tyson precooked chicken strips (thawed first).  It's a winner in our family.  :)

Delicous and easy recipe to follow.  The pesto is delicous and adds wonderful flavor.  I added chopped jerk chicken thighs I made the previous night.  It was delicous.  So many ways to alter this recipe to your liking.  Defiinitely a keeper and great for a weekend treat.

Wow!  What a fantastic and easy way to make a delicious personal pizza!  I didn't use exactly the ingredients this calls for, but close.  You could really use anything - whatever you usually put on home made pizza or whatever you have on hand.  That's the beauty!  Husband and 2 yr old loved these!  All gone!

These are very tasty and healthy.  Sometimes, I like to add some marinated chicken chunks in lieu of shrooms for lean protein.  I cut up chicken breasts into small chunks, marinate in Italian dressing, then thread on a skewer and grill before adding to the top of the pizzas before cooking.  I've also substituted artichokes for shrooms in the veggie version.

I have to admit I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but I have made MANY variations of it. The pita's are so tasty! My favorite variation is to use garlic browned butter as the sauce, spinach and onions and a little bit of cheese, bake in the oven and voila! Also, I followed the tip to cook the pita for a few minutes before you add toppings and would highly recommend!

I'm sure this would be better with green pesto and artichoke hearts and fresh basil. I thought it was okay, but if I make it again, I probably won't use this recipe. I thought the pita bread was a great healthy way to do a pizza crust though!!

A very good recipe.  I found it difficult to locate the appropriate pita bread, so substituted a 6 inch wheat pizza crust.

this is one of those recipes that is as good as you make it - add your favorite ingredients, skip out on those you don't like.  i made it on pizza dough and followed the dough's baking directions.  wonderful and healthy!

I made this recipe for a party; had never made it before.  I got rave reviews!!!!  I could not find sun dried tomato pesto so I used basil pesto from the refrigerator case.  I followed some of the reviewers' advice to pre-bake the pitas for a few minutes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe faithfully.  It was wonderful and I will make again, most definitely.  Good for dinner, also.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

VERY GOOD! I didn't have any pesto, so I spread some olive oil on the pitas and then sprinkled dried basil on top before putting the rest of the toppings on.  I also skipped the mushrooms.  I will definitely make these again!

Fantastic!  Very easy and quick, perfect for a light dinner or healthy appetizer.  The only thing different I did was add lightly sauteed red peppers and dry basil.  I also use flat-out pita bread and pre cooked it a few minutes before adding toppings.  Wonderful!  Even my meat eating boyfriend loved it:D

The only modification made was to add chopped red onion to taste.  This is a really flavorful and filling recipe.  I bet this would be a "hit" as a starter.

Really good. We didn't have enough pita so for half of them we used flour tortillas (2 for each) which worked equally well.

This recipe is quick, easy and terrific! You can easily make adjustments to suite your tastes. I added store bought rotisserie chicken. Once I was out of the tomato pesto, so I sauteed a a little garlic in olive oil instead, which was also tasty. Maybe next time I'll add black olives. I'll make this frequently, it's just so simple and good. I can't wait to serve to my friends as an appetizer at our next get together.

Excellent! My husband and kids loved it.  I served it with split pea soup for a hearty vegetarian meal.  I added diced zucchini instead of mushrooms.  It was even good the next day when we reheated the leftovers.

Wow, these are so good and so filling! You have to use the whole wheat pitas! I used regular basil pesto because that is what we had on hand. These are phenominal and I don't feel guilty eating it! Thanks for the recipe!

I read other reviews and decided to prebake-just for a few mins my greek pitas, being that they are thicker than the reg pitas. I dont think pre-baking was neccessary.It was a lil to crunchy but SO GOOD non the less. The sun dried tomato pesto and feta are Sooooo delicious together. If you sub'ed the tomato pesto with something else, you must try it with the sun dried pesto! This is a keeper for sure!

So easy, so quick and sooo tasty. Wouldn't change a thing except to bake it a little longer (20 minutes vs 17) to get the pita a little more crisp around the edges. I also used the larger 10" pitas. A definite keeper!

Wonderful! So easy -hubby even enjoyed it & he's not so much into the veggie-pesto thing. I used some homemade basil pesto I had in the freezer and added tomatoes to that. I also piled on some thinly sliced onion and bell pepper with the other vegetables. The feta is what makes it I believe. I also pre-baked the pitas for about 5 min as others suggested and our crusts were crisp and crunchy, not soggy at all. I will make these often as we are trying to lighted up our meals, but not sacrifice flavor.

This is by far one of the best recipes on the site, and I have tried many many over the past several years. The only change I made was to leave out the mushrooms. My intentions were to add chicken, but I forgot to pick up some and I'm glad I made this as is. It is one of the few meatless recipes where you don't feel like something is missing. So delicious is deserves more than 5 stars!

One thing i change is that instead of using pesto or any type of sauce, i just lay down some slices of cherry tomato(i like their flavor the most) so the bread doesnt get so soggy but you still have the tomato flavor that is a must for this recipe.

I loved this recipe. Didn't change a thing.  Tasted like I was eating pizza but more healthier. Delicious and easy way to add more veggies in my diet.

We loved this light delicious meal!  We served it up at a dinner party and grabbed a few extra pitas, pizza sauce, & mozzarella for the kids & it worked out great! It is a good as a fancy restaurant Margarita Pizza if not better! We did it twice in two weeks!

Delicious lunch idea. Easy to make and who doesn't love feta? I omitted the olive oil/parm cheese to keep it on the light side. I didn't miss the extra calories at all. I may use regular pesto next time; the sun-dried tomato pesto reminds me too much of plain tomato sauce.

Delicious!  I did add a tiny bit of fresh mozzerella but that was it.  Will make again and again.  We had them with soup.  Perfect. Not too hearty.  Just right.  Thanks for the recipe.  We loved it.

This is a simple yet delicious recipe.  I made it into a meal by adding some turkey style bacon on top.  I also cooked the mushrooms and spinach in a pan beforehand to get all the water out.  Will do again.

I didn't actually make this recipe, but I made something very similar for dinner last night, actually.  What I do is carefully slice the pita bread in half with a sharp serrated knife, around the sides, so I end up with two extra thin round pita bread slices, rather than one thick, pita pocket. (Hopefully I explained that well).  Also, I heat extra virgin olive oil, fresh garlic, and Italian seasoning in a saucepan and spoon this mixture on top of the pita as the sauce, then top with ingredients.  Some suggestions for toppings: red onion, sun dried tomatoes, (fresh spinach is the key), roasted red peppers, fresh basil, fresh mozzarella, artichoke hearts.  This is a fun, easy, and healthy recipe.

Wow, this is so good! I'm so glad I found this recipe and tried it. I followed the recipe to a "T" except I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used can (still delicious) and couldn't find sun-dried tomato pesto at the grocery store, so I went with regular pesto. Again, still delicious. Actually, I probably added a little more feta than called for too, because I like it so much. Ok, I didn't follow it as closely as I thought, but I tried! Thanks for a great recipe. I'll be making this alot!

Very good, will definetly add this to my arsenal for a quick meal. I used basil pesto, and it was delicious. Though I think when I drizzled the oil on top, it was a bit too much, next time I'll skip that.

These were excellent. Definetly use wheat pita bread, I used white and wheat and with the wheat the flavors stand out more than with the white.

Whenever I need something simple for a lunch gathering, this is what I make. I usually have all the ingredients on hand and I get rave reviews. I use regular pesto, or my mom's homemade and I don't usually have mushrooms on hand, but it still turns out fantastic! I couldn't be happier with such an amazing recipe. Besides, anything with feta is good in my book. ; )

This was a great recipe - I really enjoyed it. Very fast and delicious, not to mention healthy :) I must have used smaller pitas because mine averaged out to less than 200 calories each. A little hard to eat but well worth it - keep the napkins ready. This one's a keeper.

Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!  It is so fast and simple yet so delicious!!!  I didn't measure anything - it felt like something you would make in the mediterranean, just take a pita and start putting on your toppings.  You can experiment with different amounts of each topping and see what you like best.  I used regular basil pesto because I didn't have the sundried tomato kind, and it turned out fine.  I used whole wheat pita bread, garlic/herb feta, packaged spinach, and organic shitake mushrooms.  It's kind of like pizza, in a way, if I had to compare it to something.  I recommend it to anyone who likes greek or italian type foods and who wants something fast and easy for dinner.  I'm always looking for recipes that are relatively fast and simple, healthy, vegetarian, and that taste really good.  I find it very hard to find recipes that fit every part of the description, and this one actually did, so thanks again!!! Will make many times again.

Pretty good...I forgot the feta cheese on top, but still liked it.  Another idea is to put chopped olives and artichoke hearts on top too...just to give it some more veggies.

Pretty good but not a "5" for us.  It was healthy, quick and easy to put together but the flavor didn't wow us.  I may try again with a Flat-out type crust and more cheese/spices.

Super simple and delicious recipe. I used sandwich thins instead of the 6 inch pitas because they fit better on my pan and it was just for my husband and I.  

I mixed all the toppings together in a bowl first and then used salad tongs to pile them on  - wasn’t very neat about it. Still...Really really yummy.

This was really good. Great way to get my hubby to eat veggies. I did use all 6 oz. of pesto divided on three pita Breads. Loaded all with as much veggie toppings as they would hold.  Baked for about 16 minutes. Delish.

This is a really good recipe, but honestly it’s the sundried tomato pesto that knocks it out of the park. You could smear it on a brick to make it eatable. I subbed Hunts fire roasted tomatoes since Winter tomatoes are lacking in flavor. I also added some mozzarella to top off the spinach, I put the feta and Parmesan under the spinach. Easy and flavorful.

This was so delicious and simple to make. I added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper for some kick and opted not to use the olive oil because the pesto was enough moisture for us. I will definitely be using this as a base from now on. Wonder what artichokes or chicken would do...

Oh so good. My family had this as a meal. I used regular pesto because that's what I had. I think next time I may play around with how I pile on the toppings because the spinach is so bulky. Can't wait to make it again.

I've probably made this at least a dozen times now so I can stock up at the store without referring to a list.  I've made it both exactly like recipe and with veg adjustments and they were all excellent.  Though it's clearly hugely more healthy than traditional pizza, it's so different and yummy it's not even a comparison.

Super yummy. The tomato pesto makes the meal. Also, I cooked my pita sat a higher temp, around 400 for 1/2 the time. I liked the crispy edges!

Made it with Naan instead of pita (it was what we had handy), and omitted the mushrooms (didn't have any fresh on hand). Sprinkled Italian seasoning on top after the olive oil was drizzled on and then baked as stated. We pulled it out after 10 minutes because it was starting to look done and I didn't want the edges to brown too much. Drizzled balsamic glaze over them before eating, and it was amazing! Can't wait to make these again!

This is absolutely delicious and very quick and easy. Kind of like a flatbread pizza, but not as much cheese. The combination of all the vegetables on top makes for a meal that is not only very tasty, but decently healthy too. I could eat it every day.

I have a nut allergy so instead of the sun dried tomato pesto,  I substituted a puree of sun dried tomato in oil with basil.  I used whole wheat pita and separated them to make for thinner crust.  Delicious and I will make them again!

Used regular basil pesto and chopped sun dried tomatoes, added more garlic, onion, green peppers red pepper flakes  and sprinkled mozzarella on after coming out of the oven.  Very good, enjoyed that it was meat-free.

This is so easy and tastes so amazing- we ate two of these each as a meal with a large side salad and it was very filling.  I used regular pesto because I couldn't find any tomato basil pesto, but the flavor was still amazing.   I had to bake it for about 20 minutes at 350 instead of 12 minutes and then I broiled it for 3-4 minutes on High to crisp it up some more, but it was otherwise perfect! I'll definitely be making this again.

Really really good! I was a little concerned because I’m a very picky eater and I’m trying to expand my healthy options and this was amazing! I made it just like the recipe might try with some chicken on it next time.

This was delicious!  I used whole wheat pita and rubbed it with olive oil and roasted garlic. Then, I used advice from another reviewer and tossed the spinach, tomato and some grilled chicken with the pesto so everything stayed together. Topped it with feta and Parmesan and it was amazing!

Really good! It was easy to put together. I live in Greece, so I used flatbreads from the market.  I used basil pesto, but included chopped sundried tomatoes as part of the toppings mix.  Lovely light lunch!

I liked this.  Definitely has a good Mediterranean flavor to it.  All of the ingredients went well together.  It's quick to make and has some great flavor to it.  We will make this again soon.

This is so delicious! 4/6 people in my family love it (husband and 12 year old don't care for it). My 15 year old daughter makes it frequently for lunch. We sometimes drizzle it with Greek salad dressing instead of olive oil. Great both ways and healthy to boot!

I've made these pizzas several times with my own toppings.  You can use anything you want to.  I used artichokes, pepperoni, kalamata olives and a 5-cheese mix.  i couldn't find tomato pesto, so I used tomato bruschetta instead.   It dried out a bit in the oven so it worked well.   With a salad these make a quick and fantastic meal.

Great simple recipe. Make sure to pre bake the pita by itself beforehand or it will be very soft as a crust. Also mix the ingredients in a bowl before hand so that they adhere better. A touch of hummus works well too.

Did not change a thing and found it to be delicious. Just bounding with flavor and texture. 
I will be making this again many times.

May try changing ingredients just for variation but it is great just as written.

This was surprisingly tasty! I didn't think I'd enjoy this with the pita bread but it really did taste like a flatbread! Yummy. We will be making this again.

Loved it ... I added some Greek olives, chicken and marinated artichoke hears. Especially liked the crispy pita bread. Great since just the two of us, I just made two; one each. Could see doing this with other toppings like for a pizza, making it personal. Could even do for an appetizer with different toppings at a get together. But this was Delicious with the spinach and fresh tomatoes , such a surprise!!.

This is a great versatile recipe for any veggie pizza. I used several Trader Joe leftover items. I had a tortilla and 2 flatbreads that I wanted to use up. I had half a jar of sun-dried tomatoes in the fridge. So I added 2 of my pesto cubes, plus the tomatoes for the base. I had leftover fresh spinach, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, garlic roasted cauliflower leftovers from last night's recipe. I grated some Parmesan, used the last of herbed feta from TJs, topped with some shredded mozzarella, plus olive oil, pepper and salt. Baked and cut in fourths. It was great! Breads were crispy, cheese was gooey, veggies were tasty. Shows you can put almost anything on it.  Thanks!

My grocery store didn't have any pita bread, so I bought a pkg. of specialty very thin rectangular shaped pizza crust.  Since there were 6 in the pkg.,  I've made this 3 times.  The taste was very good.  If you want more protein on the pizza, some diced grilled chicken is a nice addition.

This was very easy to make.  Didn't have the mushrooms but it tasted just fine without them, and I love mushrooms.  Great for making for lunch when I get home from work (I only live 5 minutes away).  Will be making this again and may even try some other combinations.

This is literally one of my favourite recipes of all time. For those who had a hard time finding sun dried tomato pesto (as I did), I substituted with a mix of sun dried tomatoes in oil and tomato pesto blended together in a food processor!

Great taste combo.  I made it with the exact ingredients in the recipe except I used regular Pita bread instead of whole wheat.  I know whole wheat is healthier, but they were out at the store and I like the taste of regular Pita bread better anyway. Really, you could make something like this with any ingredients, you could use regular pizza sauce, mozzarella, and pepperoni of you wanted to.  Easy to make in any quantity too.  You could just as easily make three instead of six.  I also cooked it for about fifteen minutes instead of twelve.

This was very good and so easy to make. I did add red onion and kalamata olives.  The sun dried pesto was expense to purchase (about $6 for a 6oz jar), so I will be looking for a less expense alternative.  I am trying to watch my weight, but I love pizza.  This is a great way to eat a healthy pizza.  Thank you for the great recipe I will be making this again for sure.

Absolutely loved this recipe! A fun, easy, out of the ordinary recipe that sure beats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for a quick lunch. Even my picky children and picky husband liked this. We liked it straight out of the oven and even the next day cold out of the fridge.

This dish is so easy to prepare. I made the first round as the recipe is written. It was so yummy, I made it again the next day, adding other toppings. I will be making this again and again.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was great! It was quick, easy, tasty and satisfying,  and is really pretty healthy! Even my husband (who prefers recipes with meat) said it was good. I used reduced fat feta and added a very tiny bit of finely diced red onion to the topping ingredients. I mixed all the topping ingredients together in a bowl before piling on top of the pita crusts, rather than adding the toppings to the pitas one by one.  Next time, I will probably use less olive oil just to cut down on some calories - I think these would be just as good with even just one tablespoon of oil. The sun dried tomato pesto works great as a flavorful pizza sauce. Thanks so much for a great recipe that I will be making again very soon!

Used most of the ingredients as stated, minus the olive oil.  I used regular pesto, as that was all I had on hand.  I chopped the spinach and sautéed it with some oregano.  Also sautéed the mushrooms with some minced garlic.  The reduced vegetables prevented the layers from falling off the pitas.  I used mini pitas and served them as appetizers.  Everyone loved them!

I thought this was okay.  I added marinated chicken, which was the only change.  I did put the pita in the oven for 5 minutes to crisp them like another reviewer suggested.  That was a good idea.  I liked it well enough to do again.

I have traveled through most of Europe and most of nothern Africa. The typical pizza is mostly a cardboard crust, goat's milk cheese, no meat or tomato sauce, and rare instances of tomato. Occasional olives. The Lebanese pizzas are the worst.

Made it with regular pesto and topped it with sundried tomatoes because that's all I had. That being said, this was fantastic!! And the best part, other than it being healthy, it was so filling. A lot of time when I eat healthy I never stay full.

Used homemade pesto that I had lying around, and it turned out beautifully.  Toasted the pitas a little before topping to avoid sogginess (there was quite a bit of liquid from the tomatoes).  Everyone agreed this was a hit!

Tasty lunch, appetizer or main meal! We love this dish in our house. I made it as an appetizer, exactly as written and it was devoured. It can make a great lunch, and also can be a dinner, if a salad is added. Kids, 16, 14 and 11 all love it, and I love the veggies in it.

We didn't have the Pita Bread, so I used sliced baguette, toasted on the BBQ (both sides).  It was much better than I expected.  The pesto I used (sun-dried tomato at Walmart, less than $3), we not as oily as the regular pesto.  I didn't add the oil at the end due to other comments, but in hindsight, it could of used a little drizzle.  Really good though.  None left.  No one realized itwas spinach (assumed it was basil).

i made this as a dinner last night for my boyfriend. Our grocery store doesn't carry sun-dried tomato pesto sauce, so I improvised and spread a thin layer of sun-dried tomato hummus on the pitas. Per other reviewers, I baked the pitas for 5 minutes on their own - and they turned out perfectly crispy! One thing I added and HIGHLY recommend was a half of a large cucumber, chopped small. I also mixed all toppings together before putting on pitas and used an extra 1/4 cup feta cheese and subbed lemon pepper for black pepper. Turned out SO good! My boyfriend (who does not usually over-eat) had 3! Simple and delicious!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I can't imagine it with be as good with regular pesto.  There is something about the tomato pesto  that adds quite a bit of flavor.

Awesome recipe! Thank you. Now added to the weekly menu. We added leftover shredded chicken and sliced mushrooms. We skipped the parmesan because we're not fans, and used shredded mozzarella. YUM!!

We didn't have any  pita so we used tortillas and we added ricotta cheese (needed to use it before it went bad.) It was awesome we cooked it only for 5 min since the tortillas crisp quicker.

This recipe is very good! I unfortunately misread one of the ingredients, the tomato pesto. I read DRIED TOMATOES! Silly me! Anyway,  I did not let myself be derailed from my intention of preparing this recipe, so I went on and brushed a bit of olive oil instead of the pesto and minced 2 cloves of garlic, sliced a few dried tomatoes, and put everything else as instructed. I had a few thin slices of pancetta which I cut in pieces and sprinkled on top.  The recipe came out DELICIOUS! Next time I will get the tomato pesto and rate it again.

I made these for my adult son for lunch today and they are so good! He likes to eat healthy and this was so flavorful and had a nice crunch to the bread. I will positively be making these for him again. So thankful he loves my cooking and also loved this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly, just added a little garlic and salt.

The most important ingredient is to have a really awesome pesto and not to go too light with it, which gives most of the flavor to this recipe. I absolutely loved it!

Came out delicious! The only changes i made was leave out the drizzle of oil at the end because the first time it was a bit oily for me. I couldnt find sun dried tomato-pesto, so i just used regular pesto and topped with some sun dried tomatoes

This is absolutely amazing. I am not a veggie fan, but a HUGE pizza fan. I wanted a healthier version of pizza and this is what I found. Lets just say WOW! I actually pan fried the baby spinach in a Tbsp. of olive oil and added a teaspoon of garlic salt, as per a recipe I found on this site.  I also sauteed the mushrooms, and sliced the tomatoes thick and put them in the pan for a couple minutes too. When I do eat veggies, I like them to be soft. I don't think I will miss the fatty, greasy pizza with this recipe.

Very good I could not get the crust to crisp on the bottom and I couldn't find sun-dried tomato pesto so I just added sun-dried tomatoes to pesto seemed to work fine.  The kids liked it i will make it again.

Very good! We had this as a full meal, and did make a minor change: 'saute'd the spinach and mushrooms with garlic and onion first.  We tried this with both regular and sundried tomato pesto, and definitely preferred the sundried tomato pesto called for by the recipe. Very tasty and surprisingly filling!

The reason I'm limiting my stars to 4 is because I didn't have the required ingredients on hand and I had to improvise. I would definitely make this again!! Personal size pizzas- make 1 or more!   Its so versatile- I used what I had on hand and it turned out delish. I used basil pesto which I topped with baby spinach, topped that with pasta Ponza sauce and finished with broccoli and feta and fresh ground pepper. I can't wait to make it again when I have all the recipe ingredients on hand. Thanks for sharing this!!

This was AWESOME!!!  I made a few changes. I used Basil Pesto instead of the Sun Dried Pesto and I used Kalamata Olives instead of Mushrooms.  My wife said this was the best thing she has tasted in a very long time.  She wants it in the rotation for our regular dinners.  I will make this again for sure, and recommend this to EVERYONE!!!!

Nice alternative to regular every day pizza. Next time I am going to try with a white alfredo sauce. Very good, I made six pitas for 2 of us and we had two left over. I also added canned chicken to the toppings to get some more protein. A nice light meal- doesn't sit in your stomach and make you feel too full. (we used as a meal not an appetizer)

I love this recipe for a few reasons!
1: It is absolutely DELICIOUS!
2: You can make it in large quantities and store in the freezer. You can even put it in the oven while still frozen. Perfect for people that prep their meals days in advance!
3: I told my extremely picky toddler that it was pizza and he didn't know the difference! It's the first time he's ever eaten a vegetable that wasn't mashed potatoes since he started feeding himself!
I can't wait to start trying different varieties of this every week!

LOVED THIS! Tried this recipe last night. Quick, easy and absolutely delicious. Passed the husband test too! I made the recipe exactly as called for only adding some pepper flakes after it was baked. Will definitely be adding this to the meal repertoire.

My family and I really enjoyed this! I baked the first batch off a Pampered Chef stone and found it a little soggier than I would have liked. The second batch I baked on a cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil and it was great!

Last minute dinner decision - I had some feta cheese I wanted to use up.  I came across this recipe and my husband and I loved it!   Had some whole wheat pitas in the freezer, a jar of pesto, chopped up a few tomatoes and topped with feta.  Bold flavors, easy to make, minimal cleanup and a make again dinner or lunch idea.

This was a very delicious recipe and easy to put together. The prep time for me (novice cook) was longer, but it was an easy prep.

My husband said this was the best pizza he has ever had and we will never order pizza again.  I put a few more mushrooms and added mozzarella and a four-cheese blend.  It was totally amazing.

So easy and delish!! I didn't have mushrooms, probably added too much cheese. I did a little tweet at the end and mixed balsamic vinegar with olive oil and drizzled.

Normally I just save my favorite recipes, but my husband's  reaction to this earned it a review! 

I knew I would love this recipe, given that it's full of the Mediterranean flavor that I love, but I certainly didn't expect my husband to be the one cleaning his plate and asking when we could have it again!

I did make a few changes, but absolutely used this as inspiration.

Used a thin, whole wheat pizza crust and low fat, regular pesto. We opted out of the mushrooms, but chose to add shredded rotisserie chicken, red bell peppers, and a little onion. 

I topped it off with a little balsamic reduction to bring it all together! Easy, healthy, and tasty meal! We'll be putting this in the rotation. :-)

Delicious!! I made this as an appetizer for a cocktail party and people we asking me if there was another pizza. The first time I made this I did not have the tomato pesto so I drizzled olive oil on top of the pita, seasoned it with garlic powder, salt, pepper, Parmesan and dried Basil. Very good! Since then I've made it as written and with basil pesto. All delicious!

Made as appetizer and served on deck with cocktails.   This was a huge hit; flavorful, colorful and seasonally appropriate.   I Piled on lots of spinach as others suggested.   Also opted to use halved cherry tomatoes instead of Roma.  I will definitely make again.  This could be used as main entree it's so yummy.   Make it!

Wow!!! It's been a long time since I ranked something a five without saying "with the following changes". This is fantastic as is. I'm sitting here listening to my husband rave about this saying I have to make this for his mom!!!  That's saying something.

I made this for my family and I and we all loved it! I added a pinch of fresh basil and broiled it an extra 5 minutes after the baking process, letting the bread get a little more crisp and letting the veggies really express their flavor. Delicious!

Super delicious. I couldn't get over it. This was partially due to the tomato pesto, which I had never tried until I found this recipe--now I don't know how I lived without it.

I just made this and it is absolutely amazing!!  The only change I made was regular basil pesto because I like it.  I also put a LOT of tomatoes on because yum.  I'm so glad I bought enough stuff to make 8 of these, it's going to be dinner all week, I'm in love with this.

Delicious! Used whole wheat, flat pita bread. Layered with 1-2 spoonfuls of pesto, then parmesan, lots of fresh, chopped spinach, then diced tomatoes and feta. Sprinkle very slight amount of ground black pepper over top. Didn't use mushrooms. Try adding chicken pieces and sun-dried tomatoes. Bake in oven at 350 for about 10-12 minutes, till bottom is slightly crispy.

Delicious! At first I was hesitant because my family isn't too fond of spinach and mushrooms, but they loved it! Instead of tomato pesto, I used basil pesto, and it worked out great.

This is a winner!  My husband said its the best pizza.  After the 10 minutes, I took them off the cookie sheet, and cooked them another 10 to 15 minutes.  It put a good crunch on the pita bread.

Easy to customize to your tastes.  I don't like feta once it's heated, so I only put that on after taking the pizza out of the oven.

My husband really loved these! I did change some things based on what I had on hand. I had flat breads which are slightly thinner and smaller than pitas so I used 8. Sure enough he complained it needed more bread. Just to be safe I will cut back on the pesto a tiny bit next time. I also used about somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 a bag of spinach, not sure what would equal a bunch but he wanted more on them next time. I had cherry tomatoes so I cut them in half. I did add some Kalamata Olives, extra Parmesan, Salt and Italian seasoning on top.

This was delicious! I only made a few small changes. I added mushrooms and finely diced some turkey tenderloin (because my hubby won't eat it wit out meat). Instead of pesto I put some really healthy hot salsa with a fine dice of some sun dried tomato strip sprinkled in. Lastly, I used a flatbread  instead of pita bread. I cut some calories and fat, it was so delicious and super filling! I will definitely make it again.

Insanely good! I made this with goat cheese instead of the feta. Otherwise, stuck to the recipe. I'd make this for company!

This was amazing. I made it with a store bought jar pesto and it turned out great. Paired it with a glass of sweet red and I was in heaven. Love it!

Wonderful simple recipe.  It's a great starting point that you can easily change out the toppings.  I did not put mushrooms on and added black olives and red onion instead.  Simply wonderful!

This recipe convinced my husband that he did, indeed, like feta cheese. We have it frequently and it always goes fast. This time of year I substitute Malabar spinach for the regular spinach because I grow it and it's quite a prolific vegetable. It adds a bit of a bite that I enjoy and works well with the feta.

Terrific, very fast and easy! I used those pre-hollowed perforated pitas made for sandwiches, but just piled the stuff on top without separating them, then stuck the finished product in the fridge for later. When I was ready to eat them, I microwaved and then folded in half along the perforation for a quick sandwich.

I made it with homemade pizza crust because I didn't have any pita. The best thing for me is finding out about sundried tomato pesto...it's fantastic. This will be a recipe I will keep and make with different variations that people have suggested and as is. I will probably throw red pepper flakes on it next time because we like a little heat. Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

Tried this recipe last night in bulk for a huge party and it was a hit! I did not have enough sun dried tomato pesto but did have a jar of lemon pesto and used that and it also was a hit! Combination of flavors = amazing! Will definitely make this recipe again.

You don't need a lot of pesto which I learned after I made it the first time. Just a thin thin spread of it. The  second time I made it on sourdough bread slices and that was delicious and gave it a nice crunchy texture. Used the same bake time and it was perfect.

Not sure what the problem was here but I did not care for this much.  My husband said it was "alright" so that's why the 3 stars instead of 2. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, not changing a thing.  Found it rather bland which surprised me with such strong flavors as the pesto and feta.  Maybe my sun dried tomato pesto was poor quality. I might fiddle with it and try again.

Amazing!! I even got my picky boyfriend to eat it! I used spinach, feta, bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, and zucchini plus I used tomato sauce I has on hand and added chicken. It was perfect! The tomatoes didn't get all mushy and the spinach cooked perfectly. Will make again for sure!

These were really good and very easy. I used fresh made pesto which released enough oil during cooking that it didn't need the extra drizzle the recipe calls for, I will omit that next time. I also cooked up a sweet Italian turkey sausage, sliced it thin, and added some to the veggie toppings. Yum!

The tomato pesto makes this recipe!  It was great as a fancy side and my boys loved it.  They would not eat most of the ingredients separately but blended together this was a taste sensation!  I used shredded rather than grated parmesan for better melting.  GREAT RECIPE!

Scaled down the recipe to make 2 spinach and feta miniature ‘pizzas’ which were yummy. Other than using naan (flat bread) in lieu of pita, made exactly as written. Made more miniature ‘pizzas’ with other toppings so very easy to please individual preferences. This is a definite make again especially on game day Saturdays & Sundays.

We loved this. Used sun-dried tomato pesto from this site. Did everything as directed except marinated some chicken in Italian dressing and sautéed it in olive oil with mushrooms and then put both on the pitas.

This recipe is delicious and great to get the kiddos involved. Our family also added capers and caramelized shallots into the mix and everyone took turns building their own pizzas. Thanks for the great recipe, definitely hanging onto this one :)

This was DELICIOUS! I used whole wheat pita, regular basil pesto w a few chopped sun dried tomatoes, and subbed arugula for spinach! I also added to crumbled (cooked) hot Italian turkey sausage (I used Jenny-O). Added a sprinkle of garlic salt and it was one of the best little meals I've had in awhile! So easy too! I also baked the pita for about 7-10 min before adding toppings to ensure the pita was nice and crispy! Will definitely be making these more often!

I LOVE this recipe!! Delicious, versatile, healthy, what more could you ask for? I used whole wheat pita bread. Definitely follow previous suggestions to pile the spinach high, as it does wilt significantly as it cooks. My whole family loves this meal, including my picky 2-year-old, who is not a fan of most veggies, but loves this "pizza." Thanks for this recipe, it is definitely in my repertoire now.

Loved the pita idea. Sometimes a recipe calls for a lot of my favourite things and then it falls flat. This was not the case here! It was really good. Didn't use mushrooms due to an allergy but otherwise followed as directed. Way better than calling out for za. thx Heatherbee. Great recipe.

Yes, great add-ons are Red/yellow pepper, Asparagus, Red/Spanish onion, zucchini, and sliced pears. Great start, I just kept adding. Apple is next, will report with ingredients...

Absolutely loved this and so did my meat loving son who told me if I continued to make things like this, he'd consider becoming a vegetarian.  I forgot fresh tomatoes at the grocery store so followed another reviewers substitution and used sun dried tomato.  Will be making this again.

I sauteed the mushrooms with some leeks and then added the tomatoes to saute for a minute, then i didn't need the olive oil drizzled over. Will definitely be making again.

I've made this twice in the past week - first time with whole-wheat pita bread and the second time with pizza dough.  Both were excellent.  I played around with the toppings using diced tomato, spinach, feta, mozzarella, mushrooms and tried both tomato and basil pesto.  Everything was delicious, so easy and a true winner!

Every time I make this, I'm reminded why I started making it in the first place!  Even though this is a vegetarian meal, it is very filling.  I use the Peppy's Pita Bread recipe on this website (using half wheat half all purpose flour) for the pitas.  Absolutely delish!

Oh how I loved this! It was easy and pretty quick to make and so so good! I didn't use the sun dried tomato pesto, just used regular basil pesto because thats what I had and I din't use the pepper because I hate it. I will be making this again for sure :)

Simply put, this is easy to make and fantastic in flavour.  We added some chopped cooked chicken and some olives and it was terrific.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this twice now and it turned out perfectly each time. I used arugula instead of spinach, because that's what I had on hand, and I love the kick it added to this dish. I strongly recommend this as a quick, healthy meal!

These were really good.  The only thing I will do differently is bake the pita bread for about 5 minutes to get it crisp before adding the toppings.

WOW this was amazing!  I make a lot of pesto at once and freeze the entire batch in an ice cube tray, so I thawed two bricks and chopped sun-dried tomatoes into that.  Otherwise I followed the recipe verbatim- delicious...thumbs up all around!  Thanks :)

These are great.  I changed the recipe a little bit by using sundried tomatoes and omitting the mushrooms.  I also added some red pepper flakes to give it a little spice.  You really do have to add more spinach than you think (as others have said).  These are so easy and so good.

Really great for a light dinner or as a side along with a meal.  I used some whole wheat sandwich thins and they worked perfectly.  I look forward to using this recipe more in the future.  The topping options are endless!

We added grilled chicken pieces, no mushrooms or pesto and spread the bread with tapenade and it was a huge success...rave reviews from the fam and not one bite left over.  Great crispy crust too!

Love it..super yummy! The sun dried tomato pesto spread I used had a LOT of olive oil in it so the 1st one I made was a little over oily...the 2nd one I made I did not drizzle the olive oil over it and it was perfect! Would recommend to anyone!

I didn't have any sun-dried tomato pesto so I used regular jarred pesto.  These were delicious and just the right serving size.

Surprisingly yummy and amazingly healthy. This is definitely a keeper on my rotation! My husband wants to eat healthier but generally doesn't like the taste of healthier things, he loved this and ate two whole pitas. (4/11/10) I made have been making this recipe for my husband since the first time I reviewed it. Last time I also used the pita bread for pizzas for my boys, with mozzarella and pepperoni. Not quite as healthy but they loved them and it was really quick.

I made a version of these the other night before seeing this recipe, so just a few other ideas...I used a roasted tomato 'stir through' pasta sauce for the base, lots of spinach, chopped onion, red and green pepper, feta, and chopped fresh basil. I also halved the pitas first because I like my crust thin.  My husband saw them before they went in the oven and they looked too healthy, so he said he'd have a sandwich instead. But after he tried one, he begged me to make them more often!

This recipe is great although I will admit that I modified it, but this was the perfect inspiration for my meal last night! I used basil pesto b/c I couldn't find sun-dried, used basil tomato goat's feta cheese, chili oil instead of olive, added sun-dried tomatoes and fresh garlic and oh, instead of pitas I made it on a flat bread. It was delicious!

Very good!!  Followed exactly but will cook a little longer so that the pita is less floppy.  My husband and I had it for lunch.  I think a little fresh basil would also be good on it.  Having it again for lunch today!!!  Recipes like this one could make me consider being vegetarian !!!  thanks

These are so good. Have made these several times and they are always a hit! I just use regular pesto, works great. Next time I think I'll try roasted red pepper instead of the tomato as another reviewer suggested.

OMG Fantastic!! These were absolutely delicious. I can't wait to make them again. There are so many combinations you can make with this recipe. I used frozen spinach and a pesto mix from a bag for this recipe and it was great. Definitely will making this again and again...

I made this for my family and bf, they LOVED it. I added roasted eggplant because I had some left over from the night before. I also added some fresh mozzarella. Great side dish, could have been a main course, especially if you added some chicken.

This was delicious!  I had to use tomato paste instead of the tomato pesto but it was still great!  Can't wait to make these again!

I made this last night for dinner. I wanted something quick and healthy. This hit it on the head. I made it pretty much to scale. I used Progresso sundried tomatoe pesto and Athenos sundried tomato and garlic feta cheese. I didn't have any mushrooms so I took advice from another reviewer and used some grilled chicken I had. They were so good. I will definately make these again and again.

I really enjoyed this receipe.  Infact, I had a cold slice this morning. Yum!  I could not find a tub of sun-dried tomato pesto, so I took Giada De Laurentiis receipe.  It worked. Thank you!

Easy, quick, and delicious.  I made the sun-dried tomato pesto from scratch (recipe from this site) and added chicken and mozzerella cheese.  I would make this again.
UPDATE: I made these again last week as appetizers for company, so I used puff pastry instead of pita and cut into small squares.  They were a hit!

Tasted great! Healthy and very filling. It was kind of hard to keep the feta cheese on top of the pita, but who cares, I picked it off the baking sheet and put it back on.

I ended up eating this like a pita sandwich which was great as I hadn't let it crisp quite enough. The prepared pesto I choose as the tomato one wasn't available to me was a little overpowering, but overall. Would be a great appetizer cut into wedges.

Great quick lunch or dinner, depending on the toppings.  I like to add extra toppings just to change it up once in a while.  Always good and crispy.

Wow, these were good! I used home-made regular pesto on whole wheat pitas. Along with the items suggested in the recipe, I also topped with artichoke hearts, fresh oregano leaves and Hungarian wax pepper slices. Oh, and I cooked mine on the grill.

These were phenomenol! I used whole-wheat tortilla roll-ups because that's what I had on hand, I'm sure pita bread would be delish as well. Didn't really measure out the ingredients, just sprinkled a little of this and that until the edges were all covered. I added a little fresh basil I had on hand and also sprinkled with a few crushed red pepper flakes for a little spice. Very yummy!

Yummy!!! Easy to make and very flavorful! I've made several variations of this bake. I've used tomato basil feta, goat cheese, mozzarella, added garlic, chicken. It's delicious anyway you make it.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have any sun-dried tomato pesto, so I used regular pesto and chopped some sun-dried tomatoes over. I also added some chopped roasted red bell pepper and omitted the mushrooms. Thank you Heatherbee, this is a keeper!!!

I made this recipe exactly the way it was written.This recipe is fabulous, I have already had it 3 times this week.I did take another reviewers advice and placed the pita bread in the oven for 10 minutes prior to cooking and it was so nice & crispy.Don't skip the sun dried tomato pesto it really makes this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing this with us!

Fantastic taste, aroma, and appearance!  I only had regular pesto but would love to try it with sun-dried tomato pesto.  My only problem was trying to keep the toppings on while I cut and ate it!

Wow, this has alot of flavor! Instead of mushrooms I used Kalamata olives to make it more Greek.  I also sprinkled freshly minced basil an top, used whole wheat pitas, and added parmesean with the feta. This is a recipe to keep! Yum!

Thanks Heatherbee!  Loved it! I was looking for something to do with stale pita bread, what a find. (kudos all recipes, for having the ingredient look up!) I baked it for about 17 minutes. Unhappy with my grocery store, couldn't find any kind of pesto, so I used bruschetta tomato topping, & omitted the fresh tomato (since it was chunky).  I think next time I will use thawed,well squeezed frozen spinach. It will be easier to "load" the stuff on top.

this was delicious and easy. i have a picky eater at home who doesn't like feta cheese, but he ate two without a problem! the only not-so-great thing about it was that it seemed to get a bit oily, either from the pesto or the olive oil on top. i skipped mushrooms and added roasted red peppers. delish!

My family LOVES this. I've passed it on to friends because it's sooo easy. We use goat cheese instead of feta because it's a little softer cheese and melts better. We also use "flat bread" or "Naan" instead of pita bread b/c it's a softer, yet thicker pita-type bread & much more tasty.

Very nice dish.  It's just me for dinner tonight, so I only made one.  I'm debating making another but I think I'll have some veggies instead and be good.  ;o)  Very easy and I can see adding other veggies and it working very well.  I don't like mushrooms so I left them off but otherwise kept it the same.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband, who ordinarily hates any meal that does not have some kind of meat on it, LOVED this.  I did not have any feta cheese on hand so I used a mixture of parmesan, provolone and mozzarella cheeses.  The pita bread that I had was really thick so I sliced it in half to make a thin crust.  (Of course, my hubby said that a few Italian sausages would take the dish to the next level but honestly it's perfectly fine as is!)

LOVED IT!! The first time, I made it in the oven. The second time I put the ingredients inside the pita pocket and grilled on the George Foreman. I liked the second better, but both ways are very tasty.

Awesome! This is one of the best recipes Ive tried on Allrecipes. Discovered Tomato Pesto is a favorite. One could get very creative with that.  I followed the recipe except I added chicken I had in the fridge and my feta was garlic and herb. Im having leftovers for lunch today. Hubby took one of the pizzas to work for lunch today. Yummy! A true keeper.

great flavor and easy to make, so it gets a 5 star rating.  i made my own pesto and otherwise followed the recipe.  i would drizzle more oil on the spinach next time b/c the spinach that didn't get hit w/ oil got a bit crunchy.

A recipe is worth 5 stars to me if I want to make it again! This was very yummy. I didn't miss the meat at all, but my husband did. He tried it with chicken the 2nd time we made it. The pita makes a delicious crust!

Very delicious! Next time I will chop the spinach first, add it to the tomato-feta-mushroom mixture, mix with olive oil and THEN put the veggies on the pita! Keeps the veggies (especially spinach) from drying out in the oven).

These were so delicious. My boyfriend and I both loved them and neither of us are feta fans. The only alteration I made was using pesto with basil instead of the tomato pesto. I went to two different stores to find the tomato pesto, and I didn't want to try my luck with a third and fourth, so I settled with the other pesto. It was really good and I'll be making these again soon.

I made these last summer when the family and I went camping and I made over an indirect camp fire.  They turned out delish! I bet you can do them in the BBQ for a hot summer night's dinner.

This is a great "on hand" recipe, because of its versatility.  I didn't have tomato pesto, so I used garlic hummus; I'm not a mushroom fan, but I substituted other veggies.  Very delicious!

This recipe is tasty and easy to make.  I just lined up all my ingredients like an assembly line.  I used portabello mushrooms, which gave a nice meaty texture and taste.

These were very good.Used basil pesto and no sundried tomatoes, but were still good. Loaded with toppings which didn't make for finger food (had to use fork and knife). I did only make two for myself, so that's why I was generous with the ingredients.

So so good!  I used regular pesto and chopped sun dried tomatoes like some of the other reviewers and skipped the mushrooms and it was perfect for husband and me.  This is a great recipe to use and adjust to your own taste.

This was so good and easy! The pesto is such a big part of it that you need to make sure you buy good pesto. I actually couldn't find the sundried tomato pesto so I used regular basil pesto and topped my pizza with sundried tomatoes instead. You can use whatever toppings you want on here. I agree with other reviewers that it is a little light. I used some leftover turkey on one of mine. I also folded it in half so it was more of a sandwich. My husband really liked it too. This is a great meal to have if your family eats at different times. Each person can fix their pita to their liking and pop it into the toaster oven when they are ready!

I served this as an appetizer and everyone loved it.  I wouldn't serve it as an appetizer next time, though.  It would work better as a light meal or as an Hors d' Oeurve which won't be followed by a full meal.  I'm sure I will serve it often as a light meal.  Thanks!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this! I didn't use whole wheat pitas for all of them, but I enjoyed both the whole wheat and the white-pitas.

This was so good! I didn't know spinach could cook in the oven that quick. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't measure anything, I just eyeballed it. I used pita pockets and broke them in half. Very delicious recipe.

Outstanding! Easy to make, and so delicious.
The tomato pesto was a little strong for me, I believe next time I'll use basil. For cutesy kid appeal, I used grape tomatoes and sliced them into little rounds and sprinkled them on top. Wildly popular.

This was o.k. I think the sundried tomato pesto was a bit overpowering...The spinach didn't wilt as much as I thought it would...so it was a bit crunchy :( My husband said "it was different" We ate it because it was dinner...but my daughter and her friends ordered out for pizza :)
