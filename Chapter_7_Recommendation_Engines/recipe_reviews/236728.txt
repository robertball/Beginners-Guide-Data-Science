I left out the peas as I didn't have any in the freezer .. otherwise made the burgers as directed. I found out I am not a fan of tahini so when I had the leftovers of these, I used jalapeno ketchup. I preferred this more than the sauce

I left out the tahini sauce and used thai satay sauce instead. The burger itself was had a sweet taste and went well with the satay sauce.

was a good veggie burger and texture but had a very, very bland taste and needed too much salt and pepper.
