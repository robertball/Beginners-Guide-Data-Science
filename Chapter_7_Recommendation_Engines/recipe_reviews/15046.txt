I've used this recipe for years and it's always been great.  Well, with a few changes it works out great.

First, skip the extra sugar if your peaches are already sweet (most fresh ones are if they're ripe and ALL canned peaches are sweet enough).  If you're using another fruit, like blackberries or raspberries, then you'd need the extra sugar.  Remember, the cake mix has sugar, too.

Second, cream the cheese and cake mix together with a pastry cutter or a couple forks until it resembles a crumbly granola-type consistency.

Third, melt the butter and pour it over with the liquid (use less liquid if your fruit is really juicy!)  Alternately, cream the butter in with the cheese and cake mix (see above).

And last--cinnamon is not always appropriate if you are using this with a different fruit.  Other options that might sound better to you are nutmeg, vanilla bean specs or vanilla-flavored sugar.  Oh, and for a crunchy bonus, sprinkle the top with sliced almonds before baking.

OK, I reviewed this before but last night 8/26/07 I made this again and found a better way to make the cobbler.  I mixed the cream cheese with the cake mix in a food processor just until mixture gets crumbly. After putting this mixture on the peaches (used fresh this time) I added the butter (melted) over the top of the cobbler.  My fiance said that was the best cobbler I have ever made. I give the credit to my food processor. This recipe is now 5 stars!

This is a really great and easy peach cobbler that is a family favorite.  I did do a few revisions though.  I left out the water and suger all together (I used 2 large cans of peaches with heavy syrup instead and added 1 cup of the juice instead of fresh).  I also cut the cream cheese into the cake mix with a pastry cutter (two knives work just as well) and then sprinkled the mixture on top of the peaches and cinnamon.  I also melted the butter and drizzled it on top of the cake mix and increased the baking time to one hour. It comes out great and perfect every time.

This was awesome! BUT Im glad I read the reviews before I made it. I used the canned peaches and added the 1 cup of juice. I also cut the cream cheese into the cake mix {excellent tip} and then drizzled the melted butter on top. I cooked it for about 1 hour and it came out excellent. Nothing was undercooked. What a nice easy recipe to whip up in a hurry!! thanks!!

This is such a fast and easy dessert and it is wonderful but I do make it a bit different. We call it" peach delight". We use 1 large can peaches sliced in syrup (can use 2 cans, but I never do), 1 box yellow cake mix, 1 stick butter or margarine, 1/2 cup chopped nuts. No cream cheese. Pour peaches and juice into a 9x13 pan. Sprinkle dry cake mix evenly on top, add nuts over top. Cut marg. into thin slices and arrange on top so that it all gets covered when it melts. Bake 350 for 40-45 min. Maybe more depending on how many peaches you use, just watch. Top with cool whip when ready to serve. This may help with those who thought it was watery. It can't get any easier than this and it's such a nice and yummy dish to serve. Thanks Rebecca!

The cream cheese and cake mix make this recipe rich and delicious. I used two large can of peaches instead of fresh peaches. Also, I substituted brown sugar for white sugar. I blended the cream cheese, cake mix and butter with a pastry blender to make sure it was well blended. Also, I added 1/2 t. of nutmeg with the cinnamon. Very Yummy!

I made this as a last miniute dessert for a bbq and it was amazing!!!!  So good our friends offered to "clean the pan" and bring it back to me!  Next time I might add a little more cream cheese but the recipe is wonderful just as it is!  - Ok I have now made this recipe about a dozen times, I have added more cream cheese (2 pkgs instead if 1) and I have used other flavors of cake mix.  So far butter pecan cake mix is my favorite with a light dusting of brown sugar over the peaches.  The recipe is great as is but is easy and fun to change!

I have mixed emotions about this recipe.  For the good side, it tastes really good and although I was worried about the cream cheese it gave it a unique twist.  On the bad side it is VERY watery.  Also, the cake mix doesn't cook all the way on the top.  My suggestions would be to either not add as much water at the beginning, or to mix up the cake mix with the peaches before you cook it.  I was rather dissapointed with the appearance, but pleasently suprised with the taste.

WOW!! This was the easiest and tastiest dessert!  6 yr. old son and I made this and we used
Santa Barbara Peaches from our tree!  We ate it hot from the oven with Breyer's French
Vanilla Ice Cream. Sooooo good!

I sure don't agree with the 2 other poor/bad reviews that DIDN'T recommend this??  Mebbe they just plunked it like a 
dump cake....?  It isn't like that.  (I don't understand how theirs came out that way either?)  What I do recommend for folks using this recipe is to break up ALL of the "chunks" of cake mix with a butter knife as it sits
on top of the peaches and h2o/sugar mix BEFORE adding the cream cheese & butter.... and sprinkle an extra 1/8 c. water on top of the finished
cobbler (the butter & cream cheese part).... and by doing that, we got the yummiest crust with no underdone portions.
My son and hubby loved this -- our company raved over this one!  Plus, I was proud the peaches came from my
own tree!  Kudos to Rebecca for this one!

I've been making this for years and the love it. I vary the fruits and mixes quite a bit. My fave is yellow cake mix and just about any fruit. Common sense applies with the liquid. You have fresh fruit fine add some liquid and sugar according to the juice and sugars already in the fruit. Ex: peaches are usually way sweeter and juicer than blueberries so the blueberries get a lil more liquid and sugar. Simple nuff. Frozen fruit...same thing. Canned fruit...same thing. Just add enough to wet the half of topping touching the fruit. The butter and cream cheese will take care of the rest. And as everyone has said just cut the cream cheese and butter into the cake mix a much better blend and lends more of a cobbler consistency. Have fun with it. Don't forget you can add some extract to the syrup. I like almond the best but the possibilities are endless. Try it with a chocolate extract and blueberries with a white cake mix. Nummy :)

GREAT recipe, Rebecca!  This is absolutely DELICIOUS AND EASY!  I love to cook & bake & am always on the lookout for a great recipes using ingredients I have on hand..& this one is a hands-down WINNER!

I buttered the glass casserole dish.  I didn't have fresh peaches so I used 2 large cans of peaches in heavy syrup.  I dissolved 3 TB of cornstarch into 3 TB cold water & then added it to the syrup with one teaspoon of vanilla & 3 TB of brown sugar, & simmered it in a sauce pan until fairly thick (about 10 min), constantly stirring.  I then poured about one cup of the mixture over the peaches. I worked the cubed cold butter & cubed cold cream cheese together with the yellow cake mix in a large bowl until crumbly (only takes about 5 minutes.) Then I brushed the top with melted butter & sprinkled with extra cinnamon before baking for 50+ minutes, keeping an eye on the topping to make sure it didn't burn.  Baking it a little longer keeps the bottom of the crust from being soggy & firms up & crisps the crust a little better.  The juice-ratio was perfect b/c it was thickened.

The topping will soften overnight so for leftovers, I put the cobbler back into the oven on 350 for about 10-15 minutes.  Perfect!

I've already passed this revised recipe along to several friends after taking it to a family party.  I'll make this many, many more years to come and try out different fruits & cake mix flavor.  YUM!

Good recipe, but definitely needs some changes.  I used fresh peaches and didn't understand why it called for cup of water, it would have been a soupy mess!!!  I changed the recipe as follows and turned out perfect.  Used 12 fresh peaches, 2/3 cup of sugar, 1 teaspon of cinnamon, 2 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch for peach filling.  For crust I cut the cream cheese into a yellow cake mix, spread over the peaches and then drizzeled 1/2 cup of melted butter on top.  Baked at 350 for 45-50 minutes.

This was the first time I made peach cobbler and it came out great even though I made a mistake.  Everyone raved about it.  Here's what I did:  I mixed 1/4 c sugar into the peaches (no water added since my peaches were very ripe).  I put the peaches at the bottom of the pan.  I cut the cream cheese and 1/2 stick butter into the cake mix and sprinkled the mixture over the peaches.  I melted the rest of the butter and sprinkled it over the cake mixture.  Since I forgot the cinnamon and nutmeg (I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg to recipe) I sprinkled it on top of the cobbler.  Then I baked it for an hour.  It came out GREAT and the cinnamon and nutmeg on top made a nice crust.  I'll be making this recipe a lot.

AWESOME! What a great and SUPER EASY dessert! Took the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and mixed the cake mix and cream cheese together and then poured butter over the entire thing. Also I did use fresh peaches but instead of making the water/sugar mixture I used about 1/2 cup of orange juice and sprinkled a little sugar on to the peaches.

this is the most delicious cobbler ever! every time i make it i get raves!  like other bakers i cut the cream cheese into the cake mix.  i slice the butter thinly and place it on top in the pan and then sprinkle a little more brown sugar on top for a nice caremely sort of crunch.  One thing I recommend is to always use UNSALTED butter cuz once when i didn't my husband complained that he could taste the salt.  i think it's that cake mix already has enough salt.  i'm about to go make this right now!

Hmmmm...Did I do something wrong?  The taste was great but we had some serious problems!  First, it was WAY to watery.  I used lrg. peaches, maybe that was the problem.  Second, it was incredibly sweet!  If I make it again I will decrease the water and sugar and add some OJ instead.  Lastly, the cream cheese just sort of toasted over, it never melted into the cobbler...Hmmmm....

I'm giving this 3 stars because there was just way too much water in the recipe.  It tastes pretty good, and I took the advice of other reviews and creamed the cake mix and cream cheese together, but the extra water made it more of a peach soup rather than a cobbler.  Next time I make it, I'm decreasing to about 1/4 c, and maybe adding a tablespoon of cornstarch.

I combined a Duncan Hines white cake mix with the cream cheese AND a stick of softened butter, and it turned into a cookie dough consistency. I used 2 cans of chunk peaches with all the juice, combined with 1 tsp. vanilla, 4 Tbls of dark Karo syrup and some cinnamon. In a buttered dish I spread out a little over half of the "dough" mixture around (in spoon size pieces) then poured the peaches and juice over that, followed by more small chunks of dough on top. This way, the peaches are mixed throughout and it makes a much prettier presentation in the baking dish. I also made a little cinnamon struesel to sprinkle on top and put on about 10 min. before baking was finished. Unlike some other reviewers said, this did not come out "soupy" at all. It was just right! Everyone raved about how great it was and I had several recipe requests! Gave this 4 stars because I don't believe it would have turned out this good without the alterations.

I loved this recipe. I used can peaches and added 1 cup of peach juice, cinnamon, and some nutmeg. I also added some lemon extract. I cut the cream cheese into the mix and added some peach juice to the mix to make a paste. then I poured the butter and sugar cinnamon mix. It was great.

This cobbler rocks! My daughter LOVES it and I have made it many times in the past few years. I use canned peaches and add my cinnamon/nutmeg. Just be careful not to add too much juice. I rarely measure so I just eyeball it. The cake mix is just sweet enough and the cream cheese adds richness! I melt butter to drizzle on top. Thanks for a quick/easy recipe that is yummalicious!

This recipe has some flaws the way it is written (adding too much water, not mixing the cream cheese and cake mix well enough, etc. as mentioned in other reviews) but overall you do end up with a cobbler-like dessert. My problem is that it is WAY too sweet! The cake mix is very sweet already, and you end up with a higher ratio of cake to fruit than is appealing. If I had added a cup of sugar to the peaches it would have been inedible.

Got a great deal on a bunch of peaches at the farmers market, so I decided to make this for dessert for dinner.  We liked it, but not as much as another recipe that I have that has oatmeal/brownsugar crumble on top. It was a bit runny as well, with the added water.   Good, but probably won't make again.

Easy and good (my boyfriend had second helpings!). 
- I brought cream cheese completely to room temp and mixed in with cake mix as others recommended. 
- I used two 29 oz cans of peaches and had at least 1/3 a can left that wouldn't fit in the 13x9 pan. 
- Used nutmeg in addition to cinnamon. 
- Melted the butter and drizzled on top.
- Tried cooking on lower rack at others recommended, but ended up having to broil to get top brown. But, I had none of the "goo" that others have discussed.

This is a great recipe.  Every single member of my very Southern family enjoyed it when I took it to a family reunion.  I used sliced peaches from a jar that I found in the fresh produce section.  I drained almost all the juice by pouring it in a bowl.  After I spread the peaches, I poured about 1/2 the juice over the peaches, then sprinkled the peaches with a very generous amount of  cinnamon.  I also cut the cream cheese in with the white cake mix, topped the peaches and then put the small slices of butter on top.  Thanks for the recipe!  This is certainly a keeper!

This was a good and super easy recipe.  The cream cheese makes it a little more rich than other cobbler recipes.  After reading the previous reviews, I was a little worried about it coming out too liquidy.  I used canned peaches and drained them leaving only about 1-2 TBS of juice, completely omitting the water and suger mixture from the recipe.  The peaches gave a lot of liquid while baking and it came out perfect. YUM

Very good.  However, my cobbler came out watery.  I think I need to bake it more or use a little less of the water/sugar mix.  I would also cut the cream cheese into smaller bits and use more butter to make the cake mix crustier.  Overall, a good and easy recipe to follow.

I cut this recipe in half. I did fourth the water and sugar and that was even too much.  It was very runny.  With the topping i mixed the cake mix with the cream cheese like some of the other reviews suggested. I really liked it that way but it did burn a little and i took it out early even.

The flavor of the peaches was good. I did not like the topping. I thought it was doughy and too moist. I would not make this again.

I was given a load of fresh peaches by someone traveling from Georgia & wanted to use them up before they went bad & this recipe was perfect! I made this for a family gathering & everyone loved it! I also took the advice of others & mixed the cake mix with the cream cheese until crumbly & sprinkled on top of the peaches & then poured the melted butter over the top.  It worked out well this way. I might try the way it's written in the recipe, too, sometime just to see which is better. Great recipe, thank you for sharing!

I made it following the suggestions of cutting in the cream cheese and butter into the cake mix. the topping was to die for that way!! however, i scaled down the recipe a bunch, and the peaches/sauce was very very watery. Next time i make it, even full sized, i don't think i'll use all that much water. 
 i also didnt measure the cinnamon. I like cinnamon, so i just plopped a bunch in. I also added double strength vanilla to the peaches. Very easy to do, even w/fresh peaches! Mine weren't all that ripe, so they held up very well in the baking process and weren't turned to mush.

If using fresh peaches, don't add water!!  I only used about 1/2 cup and I had a lake of liquid after taking the first piece out of the pan.  I drained the pan three times and it was still soupy.  This tasted good, not exceptional.  Also, I had to bake it about 15 minutes longer than stated in recipe.  I wish I wouldn't have used so many of my fresh Colorado peaches on this recipe.  It would be a good recipe for canned peaches and very easy to make, if you don't want a fussy recipe.

This is very delicious!  I used lemon cake mix instead and it was wonderful. Next time I will do what others have suggested by cutting the cream cheese into the cake mix first.  I will also add a little sugar to the top for crunch.  I used the syrup from canned peaches.  Can't wait to make this again.

Great tasting and very easy.  I used canned peaches and measured out the 1 cup of juice which was basically all of it, so next time I will omit the measuring and just dump the 2 cans in the pan. I cut each slice in 2 or 3 pieces. I also left out the cinnamon as a personal preference.  It was pretty, it was easy and it was very good.  Will definitely keep a cake mix in my pantry to make again.

I made this a couple of times last year and it tasted great. I did have a bit of a problem with the consistency though (a bit runny) and I solved it by reducing the syrup a little (I used canned peaches). I rarely make any kind of baked dessert because... well, I'm just not any good at it (see profile). This one, however, is definitely a keeper for me because somehow it came out of the oven picture perfect. I did follow the advice of Chef Danielle plus added another half of a package of cream cheese broken into pieces on top, which is the only reason that I didn't give a 5 star rating because of what I felt were necessary changes. This summer I will definitely try this with fresh peaches.

Really good! I would like to serve this as a brunch side dish. I used white cake mix and canned peaches. Cut butter, mix, cream cheese and dash of cinnamon together and sprinkled over top... great texture.

This is a great recipe, I'm always looking for peach dessert recipes in August and this one is a keeper!  I omitted the sugar and water, our peaches are juicy and sweet enough.  I creamed the cream cheese and butter into the cake mix and sprinkled it all on top of the peaches.  Delicious!

I tried this with canned pears and it was really very good.  Light yet sweet enough to satisfy.  I also added some chopped walnuts to the top when baking.  Very nice, simple recipe.

very easy and certainly "toothsome"...  i made two pans and followed the recipe exactly..  when adding the butter and cream cheese, instinct told me to stop, but i used the ingredients exactly as specified..  i had to cook it longer to cause a thickening of ingredients...  now, the two pans are cooling and i must await the opinions of my associates at work tomorrow to assess how well this will be received....

Best.Cobbler.Ever!!! I made this for the first time today with fresh peaches & it was awesome. I used a butter recipe golden cake mix, cut the cream cheese into  small squares and evenly distributed them over the layer of cake mix, & melted the butter before pouring it over everything. My hubby loved biting into small chunks of th scream cheese. Will definitely make this super easy treat again.

This was very good. I used about 9 fresh peaches with peel still on and yellow cake mix. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and did not add sugar. I just sprinkled cinnamon over the peaches, sprinkled the cake mix with the cream cheese mixed in and poured melted butter over all. I turned out plenty sweet and was a wonderful consistency. will keep in my dessert file. Thanks!

I've used this recipe for years and it's always been great. Well, with a few changes it works out great. First, skip the extra sugar if your peaches are already sweet (most fresh ones are if they're ripe and ALL canned peaches are sweet enough). If you're using another fruit, like blackberries or raspberries, then you'd need the extra sugar. Remember, the cake mix has sugar, too. Second, cream the cheese and cake mix together with a pastry cutter or a couple forks until it resembles a crumbly granola-type consistency. Third, melt the butter and pour it over with the liquid (use less liquid if your fruit is really juicy!) Alternately, cream the butter in with the cheese and cake mix (see above). And last--cinnamon is not always appropriate if you are using this with a different fruit. Other options that might sound better to you are nutmeg, vanilla bean specs or vanilla-flavored sugar. Oh, and for a crunchy bonus, sprinkle the top with sliced almonds before baking.

Great taste!  Loved the cream cheese addition.  Only mistake I made was using giant peaches from Costco.  It's hard to come by good produce in Alaska, I used what I could get.  I only used 9 and it was too many.  My 9x13 was full when I put the peaches in.  What happened becasue the moisture couldn't get to the top was my cake mix didn't bake and the cream cheese got a little toasted.  I had to take it out and use juice from the bottom and drizzle it on the top and contined baking.  Next time, I will check it after 15 min and drizzle/mix a little.

I cut the recipe in half, as I only had 6 peaches, and I used an 8x8 pan.

I usually read a lot of reviews before I try a new recipe, and I forgot to this time.  At first, I did not "cut" the cream cheese and butter through the cake mixture.  About halfway through the bake time, I realized I should have, so I did.

The cobbler took over an hour to bake, and it still turned out a little runny, but I think I should have used less liquid.  Everybody who ate it, loved it!

Next time, I will use less liquid and probably add some cornstarch to it.

The cake mix did not mix or bake, the peaches came out watery and it took over an hour for it to even come close to baking, while even in the center it was still goo. I would reccommend tweaking this recipe severely before trying!

I have been using this recipe for about 6 months and love it!!! I have made it with rhubarb, apples, and of course fresh peaches. I sprinkle some cinnamon in with the fruit or topping and it always turns our great.  What I love most is how simple it is to make and how easily it can be customized for whatever fruit you have on hand.  Don't be afraid to add your own twist, you would really have to try to mess this one up.

Loved it!  Used a lot of the review tips, too (cut cream cheese into cake mix with pastry cutter, use less liquid, melt butter, bake 1 hr.)

The taste was very good. However i used fresh Oh Henry peaches and it was almost cobbler soup. I will most likely make it again but rather then a cup of sugar and water i would just sprinkle a few tablespoons of sugar on top and not add any water. I think the key to the crust is mixing the cream cheese and cake mix in a food processor until it forms clups. My crust was great and didnt have any globs of cheam cheese just lieing about on top.

My family adores this recipe done with yellow cake mix(especially my child who usually does nto like dessert). Some modifications: left out cream cheese (only because the first time I made this I didn't have it), reduced water by 1/2 c to compensate for my ripe peaches, added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and melted butter to drizzle over.  Cooked 1 hour versus 45 minutes.

I needed something quick and easy for fathers day and this recipe worked great.  My whole family loved it.  I used fresh peaches because they are in season and you can't beat fresh peaches. I also used white cake mix instead of yellow, but I don't think it would have made a difference.  The only thing I had a problem with is the cream cheese, it did not melt evenly, but it tasted great in the cobbler anyway. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who thinks making a cobbler is to difficult, because this one is extremely easy!

Very good recipe. To prevent "uncooked goo" on top of peaches, I bake this dish on the lower rack, so the peaches and liquid get hot enough to bake the topping.  I added nutmeg and a dash of vanilla extract and excluded the cream cheese.  It was a HUGE hit!!!

Where do i begin. I guess i just didn thave the taste for this dessert.I didnt like it at all. Recipe should call for unsalted butter. The top was salty.Although crunchy on top, there was a layer of "goo"on top of the peaches. I used fresh and canned peaches. Half sugar/water mixture and half heavy surup totaling the 1 cup liquid recipe calls for. I could not tell the difference between the canned and fresh so i recommend canned.Saves time and money.This is my lowest rating to date, but again all reviewers seem to like it so i guess its just a personal taste. I will continue to look for a Cobbler recipe. Will not make again.

I made this for my daughter (the only peach lover in the house) she loved it!  The rest of the family enjoyed it and asked me to make it next time with apples...it was very easy, but like others, I cut the cream cheese into the cake mix..next time I will leave it out completely.  Thanks!

This is EXTREMELY sweet, but my family really liked it.  I added 1 cup of frozen blueberries, (love the peach/berry combo) and sprinkled nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon.  I too, cut the cream cheese into the cake mix, and poured melted butter over the top.  I couldn't really taste the cream cheese, and I was wishing that it would have cut the sweetness of the cake mix a little more.  Thanks for the recipe.

Extremely easy to make and smells fantastic.  I see no need for the added fat calories with the cream cheese.  Would be just as good using canned peaches with juice, cinnamon, cake mix and butter.

Quick and easy and tastes great!!  I omitted the cream cheese and used 4 cans of peach halves (sliced).  I used very little juice - just what clung to the peaches and then about 1/4 cup more.  Baked for 50 minutes and served with vanilla ice cream.  Everyone loved it!! Can't wait to try with apples!!

I loved this cobbler, but changed a few things in the recipe. I used aout 13 fresh pitted peaches. Then reduced the sugar and water to 1/2 cup each. I then sprinkled cinnamon over the top.

I added the cake mix. I used yellow buttercake. Then put pats of butter over the top. I noticed half way through cooking that the buttery parts were soggy and the rest was not cooked at all. So I took it out and tried to blend the buttery parts with the uncooked. I cooked it completely but the top was still mushy. So I broiled it for about 10 minutes. It came out to be the most delicious slightly crunchy crust on top. It was a definate hit at my house, half the pan was gone in one night. Served it with vanilla ice cream. This is a good recipe when modified slightly.

I found this recipe to be really sweet tasting.  I read the review afterwards.  Perhaps if I'd read them before I'd have done what the person suggested who said to break up the cake mix.  This might have made it bake more evenly.  I won't make it again.

Very easy to make.  I used fresh peaches and sugar syrup that I made and had leftover from doing some canning.  It was delicious, and not too sweet.  Like others, I cut the cream cheese into the cake mix and then sprinkled it on top.  Scrumptious and I'll definitely make this again!

Love the cream cheese add on. I use two cans of fruit and butter cake mix. No water or extra sugar. I do use cinnamon on top with pats of butter till the cake mix is covered. I will try white cake mix wit the butter and cream cheese cut up in it next time with 2 cans of peach pie filling. I usually always use apple and of course ice cream!!!

I made this last night for dessert. It is SO good! I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed the cake mix, cream cheese and butter. I could have done a better job of mixing, but I kind of like the way the top turned out. It was gooey and doughy right on top of the peaches and a bit dry and crumbly on top. It turned out delicious! I'll definitely be making this quick version of cobbler again soon. I used brown sugar instead of white, and mixed it, the water and cinnamon together and poured over about 7 sliced peaches in a 9x9 baking dish. I did use the full amount of cake mix, so the topping was a little thicker. Next time I think I'll use less water, or skip it altogether (my peaches froze a bit in the fridge, so it turned out very runny) so it's less syrupy. Loved this recipe!

So if I could give this a 6th star I would. I didn't have enough peaches so I used a combination of peach (fresh) 1 small can peaches and 2 nectarines. I did as others have done and mixed the cream cheese and cake mix togather then put the melted butter on the top of that. I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet. This was very good and I will make this a keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

My family adored this!  I used fresh peaches and only about 1/4 c. of sugar and water because the peaches were pretty sweet to begin with.  I also mixed the cream cheese into the cake mix.  It cooked for a little over an hour.  Wonderful recipe!

That was the best peach cobbler I ever had.. It was different & I loved it. My entire family plus more loved it. This is how I made it I only had one can of peaches in heavy syrup so I cut the recipe in half I cut the peaches up & poured them in my pan sprinkled with a little sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, & approx. 1 tsp of vanilla mixed it all together, Then I only had a box of pineapple upside down cake mix so I used that it took approx. 3/4 the box to 4 oz. cream cheese I added a little sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, & 1 tsp. of vanilla mixed it all together until it was crumbly poured it on top the peaches patted it down into them then drizzled the recipe amount of butter on top of them then baked it until golden brown then pulled it out and mixed it all together and baked it approx. 15 more mins. I used approx. 2 tbsp sugar in peaches & cake mix & 1 tsp. of cinnamon, nutmeg & vanilla in cake mix & peaches it was so good we didnt even have ice cream to eat it with but it was great all 3 of my kids added a lil milk to there bowl of it & they loved it... Thanks so much for this GREAT recipe. So SIMPLE, FAST, & GREAT!!!

I made this for desert for our Sunday dinner. We used fresh peaches. We took the peaches, 1 1/2c sugar, and 1c water and heated it till kind of syrupy in a sauce pan. I cut my butter into the cream cheese and cake mix. It turned out AMAZING! Everyone went back for seconds.

This recipe is delicious, easy to prepare and even my husband complimented it.  I plan to show up at the next family gathering with this cobbler.  I used canned peaches with 1 cup of the juice and no extra added sugar.  It is a keeper!!

YUMMY! I used cherry pie filling as the base, no sugar, and cut the cream cheese into the cake mix Poured the MELTED butter over the top. This is my new cobbler recipe! It tastes like a lot more work was put into it!

I didn't care for the cream cheese in this. *New comment* I hate giving bad reviews on obviously popular recipes so I went back and baked this again using the other members tips. I used my food processor to crumble together the cake mix and cream cheese and pouring the butter (melted) over the top. I still found this too gummy for my taste. If you like a crispy crusted cobbler this is NOT for you. IMO this is a dump cake, not a cobbler.

This recipe is amazing, with a few of the changes suggested.  I melted the butter and drizzled it and I did cut the sugar, which was a smart thing to do.  I have made this many times and will make it many more! (I didn't give it five stars only because these changes were needed).

Very easy, and VERY sweet!  It's a little too sweet (okay, it's overwhelmingly sweet!) in my opinion, even without adding extra sugar.  Do add cinnamon-- and serve with strong coffee.  Enjoy!

I used fresh nectarines. I used apple juice instead of sugar water, to reduce sugar. Fruit was a bit tart because of that. I mixed cake mix, cinnamon & cream cheese before sprinkling it on the fruit. I had to bake a little longer.  VERY YUMMY!!!

I added strawberries to this and cut the water in half, I mixed the fruit and sugar about ten minutes before putting together. I also used yellow cake mix and cut in the butter and cream cheese. I made two 8x8 pans and saved one for my family and gave one as a holiday gift , neither one lasted long.

This was very sweet but good. I used apple pie filling instead of peaches for my fruit. I also should of taken out the cream cheese because it was just sitting on top of my cobbler and it tasted kind of odd. I added a cup of brown sugar to the top of the cobbler so that when the butter mixed with it i would get a carmally topping. That was really good. Also i added pecans to the top. The cooking time should be more like an hour though to make sure the cake mix doesnt remain dry. All and all pretty good. We had it warm with french vanilla ice cream.

This was very easy to make and delicious. I took other users advice and cut the cream cheese into the cake mix and then dotted it with butter. The only problem I had was that I didn't have enough peaches on hand. I used 2 15 oz. cans of peaches (with the syrup) in a 9"x13" baking dish. It probably could have used 2 more cans. I also sprinkled some nutmeg on the peaches along with the cinnamon. Really delicious!

AWESOME! We used peaches picked fresh from the tree yesterday. I cut the cream cheese with a pastry cutter into the cake mix, used the cin. & nutmeg. Then of course I had to make another addition, on top of the butter pats I sprinked light brown sugar! My family enjoyed this hot with ice cream, I liked it old out of the fridge. I will be making this for the holidays. THANK YOU!

Love it, delicious!  This is such a great recipe--so easy and yet so yummy!  Everyone that I have made it for has absolutly loved it and asked for the recipe.  I have only made it with canned peaches so far, but I'm not complaining.  The only changes that I have made are: cutting the cream cheese into the cake mix with a pastry cutter, and then put the pats of butter over that mixture, and adding nutmeg (as others have mentioned).  I have used both yellow and white cake mixes and I like them both.

This 'quick peach cobbler recipe' is delicious!  I used canned peaches, a sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg and yellow cake mix. The cake mix cooked on top gives it a slight cookie/crumbcake texture.  I'm very surprised how easy and tasty it is.  My son can't wait to eat supper - to eat his dessert - Easy Peach Cobbler!  Thanks Rebecca L. :)

I've gotten lots of rave reviews with this one and plenty of requests for the recipe.  I used fresh peaches, of course--it's peach season!  It sounded like a lot of peaches, but it worked out just right.  Thanks Rebecca!

YUM!!  I took the reviewers' advice and cut the cream cheese into the cake mix,then topped with melted butter and nuts (pecans). Did not add any additional liquid or sugar to fresh peaches. Very tasty and easy. I will make again!!

I made this with Betty Crocker Gluten Free Golden Cake mix and fresh peaches.  I used the tip suggested by another reviewer to freeze and grate the butter and that did the trick!  I just scattered little cubes of cream cheese though and it turned out lovely.  I had it in the oven for almost an hour before it was golden.  My only complaint is that it's ridiculously sweet.  1c of extra sugar added to an already sweet cake mix is ridiculous.  I would do only half a cup next time, or no extra sugar at all. Cake mix is sweet and so are fresh peaches.  This worked fantastic as a gluten free desert though, I must say.  The texture is great.

I did not have cream cheese, but I don't believe that made a lot of difference. It was very easy to make and tasted fabulous. I topped it also with a bit of oats and toasted pecans. Great use for fresh peaches that are almost ready to bite the dust!

Super easy and delicious!!!  I make this recipe all the time and everyone loves it!  I don't, however, ever use the cream cheese.  It's good but not neccessary.  I use the canned peaches in heavy syrup and drain all but one can.  Dump it all in, top with thin pats of butter and it couldn't be better!  Friends always call and ask for this recipe!

This is truly delicious.  I used canned peaches, no water or sugar, Trader Joe's yellow cake mix, and substituted mascarpone for the cream cheese.  Making it again tonight!

Delicious!! I have never made a cobbler, so I wanted to start off w/something easy -- this is it!! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used a pastry cutter to mix the cream cheese into the cake, and it came out great! I used canned peaches instead of fresh (hard to find fresh in MI this time of year). I didn't add any sugar, but it still came out kind of sweet so next time I will probably use lite syrup instead of heavy. Otherwise, this was FANTASTIC!!! Super yummy and my house smells divine!

This was the best cobbler!  I love the cream cheese and will make it into smaller chunks next time, as I like to be able to "taste" the cheese.  I used a spice cake mix.  Very, very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I did the same as most: two cans of peaches (maybe a little less than a cup of juice) and the cream cheese mixed in with the cake mix, also melted the butter and poured on top. Turned out perfect!! The crust was a golden brown and nothing was undercooked. We baked it for about an hour. The cream cheese makes the crust FANTASTIC.

I loved this recipe and made it as directed, however if really pressed for time, I used 2 cans of peach pie filling and left off the water,sugar, and cinnamon. Delicious

My daughter made this recipe for me. I was a little unsure about the cream cheese, but it actually gave it a pleasant taste twist. Though I do wish we had read the reviews first. Next time we will definitely crumb the cream cheese in with the cake mix first. My daughter rates this recipe a +10 for easiness, taste and looks.

I used canned peaches, and I squished them up instead of leaving them whole. I also left out the cream cheese. This came out perfectly, it was so quick and easy to make and everyone loved it!

So good that I couldn't stop eating it . I only used half the sugar, used fresh peaches, followed the advice of cutting the cake mix, cream cheese and butter together . I gave 4 stars because there was too much liquid at the end. Next time I'll use half the amount.

Delicious!!!  I made this recipe exactly as it states, it came out great.  However, next time I make this, I will use canned peaches instead of fresh (I used fresh, but its alot of work and I think it would taste just as good with canned peaches). I used 3/4 C sugar and water, instead of 1 cup. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it stayed on top of the mixture and didn't melt into the peaches, so when it came out I spread out the cream cheese a little bit.  Next time, I will blend the cake mix with the cream cheese and butter.   Definitely try this recipe, it is Delicious!!

The cream cheese in this recipe makes ALL the difference! I've tried it with only butter, and it is definitely sub-par. I used Neufchatel cheese, to subdue my healthy conscious. What an indulgence serving it ala mode....SO GOOD!

Quick,easy and delcious. I used two large cans of peaches with about 1/4 cup of juice. To make it more streusel like, I "cut" the cream cheese into the cake mix. I melted the butter and drizzled it on top.  I used yellow or white cake mix. Thanks for a simple, wonderful, tasty recipe Rebecca.

So good, very sweet. We mixed blackberries into it and mixed the cream cheese into the cake mix crumbly style.  Very easy, we've already made it twice.

The cake mix topping is quite tasty, but the inside came out pretty watery (I had reduced the water to 3/4 cup, still pretty soupy).  A note to the beginners like me, to peel the peaches boil water and turn it off, put the peach in for 40 seconds then put it in an ice water bath for 10 seconds-- the skin comes right off.

This was super easy and super good!  I did take the advice of others and used a pastry cutter to "mix" the cake mix, cream cheese, and butter.  My family liked this one better than the one I made a week or so ago in the crock pot.  This one is a definite keeper!

I too had mixed feelings about this recipe.  It tasted good, but talk about a sugar bomb.  I think there is way too much sugar in here, and the cream cheese did nothing when I baked it like the instructions said.  I ended up picking out the chunks of cream cheese.  I might make this again and just skip the cream cheese and half or elimiate the white sugar.

This turned out fantastic! I would have given it 5 stars except it needed a few changes; first of all, I cut back to 1/3cup of water/sugar, and if my (fresh)peaches would have been really ripe and sweet, I wouldn't have added any at all. Also, I added a strudel topping which tasted great and also looked very nice. Finally, I did as others have suggested and cut the cream cheese into the cake mix (used butter pecan by the way) and melted the butter. As I said at the beginning this turned out perfect, and I'll definitely be making it again.

This clobber had way to much liquid. Next time I would add liquid sparingly and mix up some of the cake mix leaving out the oil. Will try again but with many alterations.

This was a yummy and super super easy cobbler. It took me all of 3 minutes to assemble with canned peaches. I would DEFINITELY cut the cream cheese into the cake mix next time. the large chunks would have been better spread more evenly in the mixture.

Delish! I followed the suggestions of others and combined the cream cheese and butter with the cake mix until it was soft and mushy like a batter, then spread it on top of the fruit - I added fresh blueberries to mine.  This took a little longer, because it took a while to cream the cake mix/cream cheese/butter but the results were well worth it! Also, I didn't use all of the batter, about 3/4 of it, so fruit peeked through here and there, and I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the whole thing befor baking.

Very good, I served it to the Ladys Bible Class today. It was well received, and I was ask for the recipe. I will try next time cutting the cream cheese into the cake mix because all the little white chunks with toasted edges looked a little strange on top ( but tasted delicious) I had some ripe nectarines and added to the peaches...yum

This was just alright in my opinion.  It was very easy to make though.  Part of the problem might have been the cake mix I used, it was vanilla flavored cake and I felt the flavor wasn't right for this.  Also I felt like there was just too much cake, it really overpowered the peaches.  I would only use 1/2 or 2/3 of the cake mix if I were to make this again.

Just made this!! Hubby and I both loved it. I used canned peaches and also creamed the cream cheese into white cake mix. I then brushed about half of the butter on and put the rest of on in dabs. I used an 8c. stoneware pan that I was dying to break it. It worked perfectly! It browned to perfected with the exact cooking time. Will make again! THANKS!

This was pretty good, but like one reviewer mentioned, don't add water if using fresh peaches.  Mine came out very runny too.  Next time I will not add the water, or perhaps add some cornstarch to thicken it up as it cooks.  Otherwise, pretty tasty.

Loved how this turned out. The top was nice and crunchy. I used fresh peaches and probably didn't need the water or sugar. They were sweet enough as is and it turned out a little soupy, but still tasted great. I added the cinnamon, about 3/4 c. brown sugar, and a little nutmeg to the cake mix and it was good. Might add a little oatmeal next time. I will definitely make this again.

This was the best cobbler I have made or ate in a long time. I followed the advice from the reviews on the cream cheese and cake mix. I used fresh peaches though as I had lots on hand. I will definetly make this again. YUM YUM

Pretty good for easy prep... but not my favorite cobbler. A little too sweet, more like a peach cheese danish, and not a good one at that. NOt bad, but not good enough to make again. Also very unattractive!! NOt good for guests. Took much longer than recommended time.

This peach cobbler is delicious.  My mom used to make a similar cobbler, and I have been looking for the recipe for years.  I'm so glad I came across this. 
Thanks!

My family loves this recipe.  The only thing I don't do is use the cream cheese.  We have substituted other berries as well, and it turns out great!!!  Thank you!

This topping is so delicious!  I will definatly make again. I took the advice of others and blended the cream cheese and butter with the cake mix. I opted for 1/2c of splenda instead of 1c sugar. Topped it with ice cream- yummy!! So easy!

This was really good and very easy.  The only thing we did differently, as other reviewers suggested, was, after adding the cinnamon in step 3, we crumbled together the cream cheese and cake mix and 1/2 of the butter and patted that on top.  Melted the remainder of the butter and poured over.

This was a very decadent and great tasting dessert.  I did make some changes, I used nutmeg instead of cinnamon.  I used a pastry blender to mix the cake mix, cream cheese, butter, nutmeg and small amout of sugar.  I used canned peaches that I first prepared on the stove top to make sure they were well seasoned and not too watery.  With my changes this became a very rich dessert.  certainly not figure friendly but very tasty.  I will continue to make this dessert and make changes but this si a very good way to use some peaches and cake mix!!!!!!!!!!

Taste was very, very good and I'll defintitely make this again.  My only complaint is that I followed the directions using fresh peaches, and it turned out VERY liquidy and overly sweet.  I'll cut the water and sugar amounts in half next time.  Otherwise, it was perfect.  I cut the butter and cream cheese into the cake mix and it was delightful!  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone looooved this cobbler.  I made it a tiny bit different, however.  I added all of the syrup from the 32oz. can of peaches.  It didn't look quite done after 45 min of the recommended cooking time so I broiled it (to brown it) for about 15-20 min (watching it frequently).  This made it!  Someone else recommended to put sugar on top to make crispy.  A sugar/cinnamon toping would top it off nicely!

My whole family loved this cobbler.  It was so easy and delicious!  I used a yellow cake mix instead of white, and (at the suggestion of a few other reviewers) used nutmeg with the cinnamon.  I used canned peaches in the juice, and it turned out great -- very flavorful.  Will definitely make again.

This was wonderful. I cut up the cream cheese with a pastry cutter into the cake mix like the others suggested. Served this with vanilla ice cream and ate it each night willing until it was gone. Will make again.

I made this cobbler with fresh peaches, nectarines and raspberries.  It was pretty easy and quick to put together, but I'm not that impressed with the final product.  I was disappointed in the filling, especially since I used three boxes of fresh raspberries (which are hard to come by in So. Cal.  The juices were thin and not set very well.  I had read the reviews and had cut the cream cheese and butter into the cake mix.  The topping tasted great, but next time I want cobbler, I'll use a more traditional recipe.

While the cobbler was cooking, I read the reviews from other users and worried that my cobbler wouldn't turn out well, but it was pretty good.  I cooked it longer than the directions said.  I checked it after about 35-40 minutes and decided to cut the pats of cream cheese into smaller pieces and tried to spread them out a little more.  I cooked it for about an hour (at about 325 for the last 10-15 minutes.)  Parts of the cake mix still looked a little dry but the cobbler tasted okay.I was leary of putting in 12 whole peaches, so I threw away some of the bruised parts and ended up with less peaches, but then when the cobbler was done, I wished I had used more peaches.  (So use all the peaches it calls for!!)  I also think it would have been better if I had followed other reviewers' advice about cutting the cream cheese and butter into the cake mix before putting on top of the peaches.

I made this how timid written, using 8 large peaches (not the 12 it called for), and my 9x13 casserole was loaded. Next time I will use ½ cup of sugar mixed with the peaches, and no water as this came out of the oven very soupy. The flavor is fantastic. I won't change anything else. Thanks for the recipe.

I used canned peaches for this....in light syrup.  Taking the advice of another reviewer, I reduced a couple tbsp. corn starch in a little water, then added it to the syrup in a small saucepan and stirred constantly over low heat until it thickened.  I did not add any additional sugar, or brown sugar, which turned out to be fine because the cake mix itself was sweet enough (I used yellow cake mix).  I was a bit liberal with the cinnamon, sprinkling it directly onto the peaches and also on top of the cake mix.  I melted the butter to drizzle over the top, and made sure to cover the whole dish with it.  Served it warm with scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Very sweet, went over well with the adults and kids.

Easy and delicious! I used raw sugar instead of white sugar. i also used canned peaches in heavy syrup and i sprinkled brown sugar over the peaches as needed instead using the 1/4 cup of white sugar.

The family LOVED this accompanied by homemade vanilla ice cream! Next time, I will use less liquid, it was too runny. But yeah!! again, we loved it!

This recipe was ok. I made it for church as my dessert, I will probably omit the dabs of cream cheese b/c they sort of just burned. But other than that it was simple and tasty. Thanks for sharing!

I agree with other reviewers. This was very easy and tasty, but way too runny!!!! I uesd fresh peaches which were very juicey. If I try again, I will eliminate the water or use less. I think I will stick with the traditional cobbler recipes and make my own topping. The cake mix idea was just ok. Very easy and convenient, but not into all the "not so healthy" ingredients like extra sugar and salt, partially hydrogenated oils,artifical colors and perservatives. There are definitely better and  healthier recipes to enjoy the delightful fresh fruits of summer. This one was not "it" for me.

I followed the recipe, using fresh peaches.  Crumbled cream cheese into cake mix and used melted butter as others had recommended.  However, the cobbler turned out VERY watery... kind of a cobbler soup.

Loved this recipe!  Much like the famous "dump cake" recipe, but the addition of the cream cheese made it sensational!  Next time, I will use only 1/2 to 2/3 of the cake mix, and I will mix in a half cup or so of chopped pecans!

So this I have to say tasted great. This the first time I made it and it didnt look very good. I will make it soon since I screwed it up the first time and it still tasted great. I used can peaches(2 large cans like everyone lese did and 1 cup of the syrup instead of the sugar water). The cream cheese didnt melt so I will cube it smaller next time. The one star less is for the apperence of it which looks like my fault. Great thing about this dis is it took 10 min to prerpare and if you have kids they will love it. All 4 of mine did.

Whoa! was this sweet.  I used the canned peaches and did not add any sugar and drained most all of the peach juice off, it was still way too sweet!  The cake mix is what did it.

Really good except I found the cobbler still too sweet using 1 cup of the drained peach syrup - especially when served ala mode with vanilla icecream.    Next time I will use 1/2 to 3/4 cup water for the liquid (no sugar as recommend when using canned peaches.)  I used 2 large cans of peaches and sliced them further in half lengthwise. I also blended the cream cheese and butter with the cake mix to sprinkle on top as suggested, which made a nice crust.

Holy cow that's good!! I used fresh peaches, and lots of them. I also cut the cream cheese into the cake mix and melted the butter before putting it on top. This was so simple and is the best cobbler I've had. Thank you!

I thought this was good but not amazing.  I had frozen the peaches with about 1/2 cup sugar.  When they thawed, I tossed most of the liquid and I'm glad I did.  I turned the oven off after the 45 minutes and left the cobbler in to set--which worked perfectly.  Too much 'cobbler' and not enough peaches, I guess.  Next time I will add more peaches.

This was so easy!  A great alternative to having to make a pastry crust.  I also cut the cream cheese in.  I used yellow cake mix instead of white.  I  boiled the water and sugar first, along with a 1/4 c. of butter, before I poured it in.  My husband raved.

This tasted wonderful for the 1st 3 bites...and then it was sooo rich we all had to swallow hard to get it down, leaving at least a 1/3 in the bowl.  It baked up great though, & I used jarred peaches.  I combined the cream cheese, cake mix, & 1/2 of the butter in the food processor.  I only used 1/4 cup peach juice & I wouldn't use more...it wasn't too watery but still very moist.  Melted the remaining butter & drizzled over the top.  If you think you can handle mega rich, give it a go...it tasted really good.

Made up 2 casserole dishes of this Peach Cobbler for my son's 4th Grade class. It was very easy and went together very quickly.  The kids at the school loved it. I used my food processor to combine the cream cheese & cake mix as mentioned by another reviewer.

Beautiful and easy.  I agree with the other reviewers.  Cut cream cheese and 1/2 the butter into the cake mix, then spread on top of the fruit.  Top with remaining butter and cook for 1 to 1 1/4 hours.

Be sure to read the other reviews prior to making!  I wish I would have cut the cream cheese into the mix first - cobbler looked VERY weird when it came out of the oven.  Tasted good, but looked weird.  I had a lot of 'what's THAT?' before people ate it.  Also - I utilized the peach juice (from canned peaches) and will probably add more sugar next time (or add it into the cake mix)... it just wasn't sweet enough.  Easy recipe, good overall - but directions weren't all that clear.

It was easy and good, but after a few bites, it tasted a bit doughy, I may have added too much of the syrup from the canned peaches.  Will make again, using less.  Thanks for sharing!

I just served this for dessert to some dinner guests and my parents and the guests said that this was the best peach cobble they have ever had. I followed some of the reviewers' advice and used two cans of peaches, 1 1/4 cup juice, and mixed the cake mix, cream cheese, and butter and crumbled it on top and then sprinkled with cinnamon and baked for 40min. Delicious!!!

Fabulous!  I froze the cream cheese and butter, so that they were easier to slice thin to cover the entire top.  Great hit with the kids and family!  It's a keeper!

Really good flavor in the crumble topping (I used yellow cake, and blended it by gloved hand with the cream cheese as other reviewers did, drizzled with the butter), and I think the recipe has potential, but I was fairly disappointed with my first attempt.  I used canned and frozen peaches, and a little less than a cup of the syrup from the cans... it was beautiful until we cut into it, and then it was a soupy mess.  I think you should do a couple of practice runs with this recipe before presenting it to a hungry crowd on Christmas as I did (luckily I had made 3 other desserts).  The topping was tasty, and I give it 3 stars because, although I threw my portion away after eating the topping, my mom insisted it was delicious and wanted to keep the leftovers.  But keep in mind that she's my mom... ;)

Easy, used canned peaches and it tasted excellent. I've made it with and without cream cheese. Always a hit.

I made this recipe using canned peaches, omitting the water and sugar and using some of the drained syrup from the cans. I creamed together the softened cream cheese, softened butter, and cake mix using a hand mixer. The topping turned out great and the filling wasn't too sweet or watery. It went together super fast and easy. I'll be using the recipe again, maybe with other types of fruit. BTW I used reduced fat cream cheese with no appreciable difference in taste.

i made this recipe twice. first time i used frozen peaches and used the sugar water mix around the peaches, i thought it was very good, i had a "old timer" tell me it was too sweet for her taste so i made it a diffrent way. i used canned peaches with the syrup drained off and only water around the peaches no added sugar. i thought both ways was very good. if your going to have icecream with this cobbler id leave out the added sugar in the recipe.

This is much better with fresh peaches but canned work fine too. I've made it with and without the cream cheese and people liked it just as well. It's fast, easy and very impressive. I have shared this recipe with many of my friends.

I did not care for this recipe.  I was looking for something to make for company that was quick and easy. It tasted like I was just eating dry cake mix.  It's edible, but I won't be making it again.

I've used this recipe twice and it turned out great both times. So easy to make and the cream cheese gives it a great flavor. I did read the reviews first and also cut the cream cheese into the cake mix , worked great. Will continue to use this recipe

I made this recipe only used Splenda in place of the sugar, cutting the calorie count some.  I added 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water. I also added a Tablespoon of minute tapioca, and it was still somewhat watery consistency. I also added chopped pecans and coconut over the peaches before putting the topping on. I mixed the cream cheese with the cake mix till crumbly, and it worked great to do that. It turned out beautiful and very tasty, now I am wishing I added the pecans to the topping instead of sprinkling over the peaches... will do that next time.  I am thinking I will use cornstarch with the water/sugar mixture next time too. Delicious, the topping is awesome.... add some pecans and it will be DELIGHTFUL!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome!! I only used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water with fresh peaches. It was perfect. I followed everyone else's recommendation of crumbling together the cream cheese and cake mix and then using melted butter on top. Definately will make this again.

I gave this 3 stars because it does taste good, but what a waste of cream cheese...couldn't taste it. I cut the cream cheese and butter into the cake mix as others recommended. Another thing that didn't impress me was that the topping got kind of soggy the next day. This surprised me because I baked it in a bigger pan [14x11x2 inches] for the same amount of time, so it was nice and golden brown.

This was great.  I cut the cream cheese into the cake mix, melted the butter and poured it over the top of the cobbler, and used 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Serve it warm with vanilla ice cream and it's amazing.

I thought it was very good, but I think I'd prefer it without the cream cheese.  I also didn't have white cake mix, so substituted yellow. I will definitely try this recipe again... sans cream cheese, and use white cake mix instead of yellow.  I also added a "pinch" more of cinnamon.

I made this with a commenters revisions.  I used 2 large can of sliced peaches, and one cup of the juice.  I cut the cream cheese in with the cake mix, and melted the butter.  Awesome, simple recipe!

I didn't have cream cheese so I added 2 tablespoon of sugar to sour cream and used it. My peaches were frozen. I didn't add the water, just scattered the cake mix, spread the sour cream, and dotted with the butter. I made it half size and used a Jiffy cake mix as they are only 9 ozs. It turned out great and I really went to a lot less trouble than the rest of you.

I had fresh peaches,and very little gluten free flour,so I found this recipe to make for a family gathering. I am happy to report that this conbler got rave reviews! 
I have gluten free diets in my family,and I poted for a gluten free yellow cake mix. I followed another reviewer advice and processed the cream cheese and cake mix in my Ninja blender which was way much easier then blending the mixture with a hand pastry cutter. I also did not add water, or sugar to my already sweet rippened peaches,too much water would have been a disaster! I am looking forward to trying this recipe with other fruits,rather it be fresh,frozen or even canned.

Made it as written, I used canned peaches in Heavy Syrup instead of fresh ones.  Used one cup of the reserve liquid from the peaches.  I also cut the butter and cream cheese into the cake mix.  When I placed the cake mix on top of the peaches I gently pushed the batter into the peaches so that it could absorb the liquid from the peaches while it baked.  Cooked it in a 350 degree convection oven on the middle rack for 55 mins until it was golden brown.  Came out perfect. there was no excess liquid since the cake mix absorbed all the liquid.

I followed the instructions pretty closely (for me!) except that I used a bag of frozen peach slices +a can of diced mango.  I used the juice from the canned mango.  I added about 1/3 cup of brown sugar with the the cinnamon.  Served with whipped cream on top, it was delicious!  Cutting the cream cheese into the cake mix worked really well too.  A quick and easy to throw together dessert all in all!  I’ll definitely be making this again in a month or so when fresh peaches are in season!

made it tonight, gave it 3 stars because we didn't have it out of the oven. we followed the recipe exactly with fresh peaches. I had to use a fork to mix the topping when it was about 30 minutes into the bake to mix the cake flour in. baked for about a total of 1hr 30mins. its beautiful and tasty. next time I'll cut the cream cheese into the cake mix and maybe melt the butter. thanks for a simple recipe.

There were a few flaws to this recipe as written, but it really doesn't matter because it tastes amazing. The cake mix/cream cheese combo is delectable. And using high-quality peaches definitely helps.

First of all, 12 peaches is a LOT of peaches. I used 10 peaches in a standard 9x13 casserole dish, and that was quite enough. I also used a slightly smaller size of cake mix.

An easy peeling method for peaches: boil the peach in water for 30 seconds, then put it in ice water for 10 seconds. The skin should basically slide right off. They do need to be at least slightly ripe for this method to work. 

Like others, I mixed the cream cheese and cake mix together before baking, and i melted the butter before drizzling it on top.

My one criticism of the dish is that it was very runny. A full cup of water is probably not necessary. I'd go with 1/2 c water and sugar next time.

Followed the recipe exactly, except for white cake mix. Largest I could find was 16.5. Baked for 55 minutes. Pats of cream cheese got brown, didn't melt, cake stayed white, ended up just soupy.

This is excellent.  Don’t like sour cream so left it out.  Only issue was it was soup.  Next one I make it it’ll be with less or no water.  The fresh peaches themselves provide plenty of moisture.

Very easy and very tasty. I used unsweetened peaches I had frozen last summer and poured the water-sugar mixture over them. Like others suggested, I combined the cake mix and the cream cheese. I melted the butter and drizzled it over the top of the cake mix. The result was wonderful. My husband said it was the best peach cobbler he had ever eaten. I will be making this again very soon when fresh peaches are in season. I'll also be freezing some peaches so I can have a taste of summer in the middle of the winter.

This is my first time making peach cobbler and it turned out GREAT!! I did take a few suggestions from other reviewers. First I poured my peaches in a pasta strainer  (bowl underneath of course). I heated a 1/2 stick of butter in a pot with my peaches, cinnamon and nutmeg then poured in 13x9 in pan. I mixed my yellow cake mix with my cream cheese and the other 1/2 stick of butter.....mixed until completely incorporated then put on top of peaches. Finally, I sprinkled with cinnamon and baked for about 45 minutes. The topping was beautiful and my husband and son loved it! This is my FOREVER recipe!

I put big blops of cream cheese in mine.  Next time I'll slice the cream cheese thinner so that some cream cheese is on the whole cobbler.

I used Betty Crocker Gluten Free cake mix, so my husband could eat it.  Nobody even suspected; it was so good.  I sometimes substituted more butter for the cream cheese. My son liked it better with just the butter, but its good either way. I only used fresh peaches, not sure it would be as good with canned.

Guess I should have read the review first.  Mine turned out too watery and wasn't cooked well at 45 mins.  At that point I tried to sorta mix the cake and butter and cream cheese, but I'm afraid it was too late.  And still too watery.  I'd prefer the recipe be clearer so I don't have to read a bunch of reviews to fix it.

Always remember to read comments before starting a recipe.  Taste great but the cheese just sat on the top of everything.  Did not like that.  Should have combined the cheese with the mix and this recipe would have been a definite 5

This was very very good although  a little on the sweet side for my taste.  Girls at work raved about how good it was.  I had to take out of the pan with a large flat spatula with holes in to drain some of the liquid away as I used fresh peaches and it is too much water to add.  I also blended the cream cheese into the cake mix.  The top stayed crispy what most people like!  Will make again with apples!

It was easy but warning do not make with low fat cream cheese. My husband picked that up by mistake and it made it weird. It didn't melt and burned in places like a marshmallow

LOVE IT!!!  I make this often, at several people's requests.  I use 2 large cans peaches.  Definitely cut the cream cheese into cake mix using 2 knives instead of laying on top. Then melt butter & drizzle evenly all over top.  I prefer to use a little more cinnamon. Had to cook a bit longer than what directions said.

This was perfect and delicious! I substituted with marionberry's and added a little sugar and cinnamon then did exactly what directions called for. After 45minutes the pads of cream cheese weren't melted enough for me so I used butter knife to spread and let it bake another 10-15 minutes until the cake mix topping looked more done. It was the first dessert to be gone at the family reunion;) Loved this!

This was definitely easy like the title states, but no where near being as good as a from scratch recipe.  I guess for a quick dessert it works, but the presentation isn't what I would like to serve to a guest.

VERY SWEET!   Yummy!  I only had 8 peaches so I added 1.5 cups of plump red latham raspberries fresh from my garden.  Very good.  I may omit cream cheese next time.

Made this for Christmas.  It was fantastic.  Only had one can of peaches so I halved the cake mix but still used 8 oz of cream cheese. Baked it for about 30 minutes in an 8x8 pan & it came out perfect.  This one's a keeper!

I thought this was pretty good.  I did take other reviewers' suggestions and cut the cream cheese into the cake mix.  I think next time I will go with just cutting it into small chunks because I think I would like it better if there were little creamy pockets of cream cheese throughout the topping.  I also agree when other people say there is too much liquid.  I did use 2 cans of peaches and 1 cup of of the heavy syrup and found it very watery.  I will only use about 1/2 cup next time.  All n all I think the taste is great, although would probably be better with fresh peaches.

Good flavor.  I used a butter recipe yellow cake mix.  I have to agree with many others about cutting the cream cheese into the cake mix, then pouring melted butter over the top.  It turns out a lot better.  The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is because it was slightly watery.  Not a lot, but just a little too much.  I won't add as much liquid next time.  Otherwise, great recipe!

Great twist to a dump cake!  I did make a couple changes - added strawberries, sprinkled brown sugar on fruit instead of white sugar, and mixed the cream cheese into the cake before putting it on top.  Awesome!  In fact hubby is devouring it and he complained the whole time I was making it "why does it have to have peaches and strawberries?"

i tried this last night, and after taking other reviewer's advice, cut the cream cheese and butter into the cake mix.  it was ok, but i will probably just stick to my regular crumb topping for cobblers and peach crisps.  easy and quick though, just not my kind of topping.

I had such high hopes for this, but it was NOT good. I guess I must have done something wrong, because all the other people gave this rave reviews. I found it very powdery tasing, from the dry cake mix. I don't know, it just wasn't good. Sorry :(

I enjoyed this recipe, and it's soooo easy!  I happen to use too much syrup from the canned peaches I used, so it was a little runny, but the taste was excellent.  I took some suggestions and mixed the butter and cream cheese with the cake mix, and it turned out really good.  The flavors were evenly distributed throughout the cobbler.  Excellent find....will definitely make again trying different fruits!

This recipe is great.  I have used white and yellow cake mix and they both have a great taste.  When using canned peaches, I usually put in about 2 tablespoons of sugar just to coat the peaches in the pan.  It does not come out too sweet with the syurp from the can.  Anyone that love a cinnamon and cream cheese taste should try this!

This was an EXCELLENT recipe! I went by the less watery route..put 2 cans of peaches with 2 tbls of the juice, put the cream cheese in between the cake mix as suggested and voila!! Only problem was that the topping tended to be a little burnt around the cream cheese area..and a little soggy where the butter was daubed. Otherwise, it was a hit with my party!
