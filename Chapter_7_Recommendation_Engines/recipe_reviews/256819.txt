We really liked these! I do wish that I would've really packed the mushrooms in the jar tightly though, b/c when you pour in the hot liquid, the mushrooms begin to shrink down and it leaves a lot of empty space in the jar, which doesn't look so pretty. Other than that, these are very tasty, and I will be making them again! Thanks for sharing. :)
