It was nice to grill our entire meal, but the bacon never got done (and I used thin bacon, for just this reason).  The potatoes and onions were almost overdone when I waved the white flag for the bacon.  Aside from the bacon issue (which may just be me), these flavors were just ok for me.  I prefer roasted potatoes.  THANKS for the recipe (and a cool kitchen ;) )!
