very good! I added sliced avocado and sliced tomatoes underneath the chicken mixture and added extra cheese. I also used rye bread which turned out yummy! One tip:  toast the bread on both sides under the broiler so it won't get soggy when you add the toppings.

What a great idea Laughingmagpie! We love fajitas, and this was a delicous way to make them! I did toast my bread first(as I do for Bruschetta). Will make these again and again. The only thing I will do different, is to use fresh spices (garlic, cilantro, lime juice, etc.)next time to season the meat, instead of the taco packet:just a preference. Thank you, for a new favorite!

This is my recipe and want to point out that these are not "fajitas," they are melts; open-faced sandwiches that are topped with cheese and broiled (ie tuna melts, patty melts). We still have fajitas sometimes, this is just a different quick meal, cooks relatively quickly and goes down quick.

Oh yum - a quick and easy way to have all the deliciousness of chicken fajitas with about half the work! I cut this down for myself to have at lunch and used one chicken breast seasoned with "Taco Seasoning II" from this site.  I toasted my bread first and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients.  Fabulous topped with a little avocado and a dollup of sour cream!

Quick, easy, and delicious! We really enjoyed these. Besides cutting the recipe down (there are just 2 of us), the only thing I changed was to omit the onions and added a clove of garlic to replace the flavor. Definitely a keeper, thank you laughingmagpie! :)

This was so easy and so full of flavor. The french bread is a nice touch too. I would have never thought of combining tomato juice with the taco seasoning for a sauce. I think I might even add some ranch flavor next time.

really good, incredibly easy to make. didnt use tomato juice and didnt need it at all. used mexican cheese blend and cheddar, just a regular roll.  The only issue was the timing, by the time the veggies were cooked the chicken was way overcooked. next time ill cook them separately and put them together in the end. will make again

We had dozens of soft sandwich rolls leftover from a party and so we made this and put it on the half-slices. Toasted them first. This was delicious! And I will be making these to freeze for easy snacks.

A good base recipe which can be tuned to personal tastes. Would recommend toasting the bread before putting the salsa & chicken on it, was way too soggy for us and folded in on itself.

NUMMY NUMMY NUMMY!!!  I use chicken breasts that I had already cooked in a crock pot cut them all up, I put them in a pan to brown & heat up a litte with some EVOO in there I added onion & red pepper-Which if you like add more!!  This was so easy I didnt follow the recipe either & it turned out great!  I was not all that impressed with it on the thick bread, you could use tortilla if wanted too.

I made this exactly as written except that I used ciabatta rolls.  DH just loved it.  This was a big hit.  I made pork and beans on the side.  Will put this into regular rotation.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Delicious; quick and easy too! I only made some minor changes. I decided to make my own taco seasoning using "Taco Seasoning I" from AR which gave this a good amount of heat. I didn't have any fresh red bell peppers so I used the same amount of chopped, roasted red bell pepper instead. I also subbed chicken legs and thighs for the breasts. I boiled the chicken until it was almost fully cooked then let cool to shred before adding it to the rest of the mix in the pan. We used regular toast bread and it still came out great. We will be making these more often for sure!

Excellent Melts! I followed as written BUT used Quorn brand vegetarian "chicken breast cutlets". Honestly, my boyfriend and I agreed that we prefer these instead of fajitas..LOL! I'm a bread gal, and these are more hearty, which we love! I really love the addition of the tomato juice which adds wonderful flavor. From now on when I make tacos, or anything that calls for taco seasoning, I'm using tomato juice instead of adding water, such a wonderful idea. We topped these with sour cream and I will make this again for sure, thanks lmp! :)

This was great. I didnt use chicken but beef that i had cooked and shredded a couple of days earlier. The filling was soooo good. Tasted very authentic mexican-like. I loved the tomato juice as opposed to reg. tomato sauce. This would be great in corn tortillas. Oh, and because I didnt read the directions, I added the salsa in with the rest. Great way to use up extra beef or chicken! I made my own taco seasoning as well. And since I'm not a big bread eater, I hallowed out my bread a little bit so I could get more filling in.

I made this recipe on both French bread and tortillas - both worked very well.  The French bread does get soggy from the salsa as mentioned by other reviewers so I would toast the bread the next time.  Having said that, the flavor was still wonderful and made for an excellent melt.  I didn’t have any tomato juice on hand so I just used water to distribute the seasoning which worked out fine.  We all enjoy it.

This was my first "melt" and I learned, as other reviewers did, that my bread should've been pre-toasted.  I'll likely make this again with several tweaks.  I served it to my mother and 9 year old and both REALLY liked it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great idea which I want to give credit. That being said, I made a few changes for personal preference.  I used a fresh, fire roasted salsa on the the bread instead of tomato sauce. I too, toasted the bread first so it would not be soggy. I did not use a taco season packet...I used the Pollo Asada from Trader Joe's.  I grilled the veggies and the chicken, layered them over the salsa and added Jack cheese. Broiled until cheese melted and topped with sour cream and avocado. It was DELICIOUS! And pretty too! Thanks again for the starting point...love that about allrecipes!

Excellent! The grandkids even said that it was easier to eat on the French bread because nothing fell off! Out of the mouths of babes. DH topped off a serving with another piece of bread and took it to work for lunch the next day. Thank you for sharing!!

YUM!  So delicious and easy.  My husband declared it was one of the best open faced sandwiches he has had.  I did not have tomato juice so I used salsa instead.  This is a definite keeper.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Super quick, easy, and you can definitely customize it to your tastes/preferences.  I didn't steer off the recipe much and when I did, my alterations were pretty basic.  I used a bit more than 2 Tbsp of fajita (not taco) mix (eyeballed it), used low-sodium V8 juice instead of tomato juice, and used organic chicken.  Like others, I toasted the bread under the broiler before adding the chicken etc.  I also omitted the salsa on the bread and just served it on the table as an option instead.  These were so yummy that no one used any however!  Great weeknight healthy dinner!

I served this on allrecipes Peasant Bread.  I made the 4 serving (1lb chicken) version of this.  I used tomato soup instead of tomato juice & fajita seasoning.  I feel like I should have put a slight bit more red peppers & onions.  Be careful to not use cheap or low-fat cheeses that do not melt well.....mine tasted like plastic after melting it.  The timing on everything was perfect & I will make again.

LOVE this recipe!!! Thank you for putting it on here. Fast, easy and cheap... PERFECT for a quick meal... For added color, I added 1/2 cup Green Bell Pepper, a dash of Oregano and a dash of Chives and used tomato sauce instead of tomato juice.

I loved this recipe. I slightly changed a few things.. I used homemade pico de gallo instead of salsa, I added some sliced garlic and used bloody mary mix instead of tomato juice. This recipe is going to the top of my list

I decided to try this recipe because my sister gets frozen chicken fajita flat bread melts and loves them. I only made a few changes first I used flat bread not french bread, second I didn't have tom. juice so I just used water and third I used colby jack cheese instead of cheddar. They turned out great. I will make these again.

YUM!  This was so good and super easy. My husband and I are always trying new recipes and such and this one has enough steps where we can try to make it together... We thought it was so good and plan on making it again.  I would have liked more spice-perhaps instead of taco seasoning maybe fajita seasoning or a spicer salsa would do the trick, al in all-a great reciepe...

These were very good!  Excellent!  I did make some changes based on other suggestions and my own taste:  I sliced the chicken into strips then cut them into small cubes.  I added a little water and tomato juice to the meat/taco seasoning mixture, and added some garlic powder and a little seasoning salt for flavor.  I let everything simmer for about 15 minutes.  Then, I toasted the sliced french bread (purchased freshly sliced french bread) on broil for a couple of minutes, took it out the oven, added some shredded cheddar cheese, topped the bread with meat, then some shredded colby jack mixed cheese, and put back in the oven for 3-4 minutes on broil.  I did NOT put the salsa on the bread for fear of it becoming soggy.  We dipped these in Litehouse Jalapeno Ranch dip.  OMG!  This dip is SOOOOO good and really gave the fajita melts a good taste.  I used all the ingredients from the original recipe (with the exception of those I mentioned) and following the recipe to a tee for the most part.  This is VERY good.  Next time I'll probably mix some sour cream with the jalapeno ranch to make an even better dipping sauce.  Thanks for the recipe, laughingmagpie.

These were great, even though I had no salsa and only had hamburger buns instead of French bread.  I used tomato sauce instead of juice by choice, and my husband and I both enjoyed it.  I'm sure I'll make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was soooooooo good.  I used green peppers instead of red but other than that followed the recipe.  The next time I make it I will slice my bread to be like French Bread Pizza as I think it will be easier to eat.  Thanks for a great add to my box LMP!

this was a delicious and easy weeknight meal using a store bought rotisserie chicken and homemade taco seasoning mix (so much better than the packaged stuff) As suggested by many other reviewers i toasted the bread under the broiler slightly before adding the toppings and i'm glad i did. I think the bread would have been soggy otherwise. Thanks for the post. I will make this again.

This dish is not only pretty to look at, it is delicious too! I agree with another reviewer that you might want to toast the sliced bread slightly first as I found them to be a little soggy from the salsa. Great tasting nonetheless!

In reading the reviews, I changed things a little bit.  I marinated my chicken after it was sliced in the tomato juice and taco seasoning. I let it marinate overnight.  Cooked the chicken, onions and peppers and added another cup of tomato juice.  LOVE THIS!!!!!  We used it as fajita wraps and will be using this in lunches all week!!!

This was AWESOME!!! The only thing I did different and it was awesome.... was I added a "plop" of cream cheese. I made some extra. Because with the extra I make chimichangas out of it. But I reheat on a skillet pan and add the microwave rice till warm. I put the contents into a wrap and then make the wrap into a burrito put butter on  the outside of the wrap and put it on a griddle and fry em up till crispy on both sides. Top with cheese on the side that was just fried and serve with sour cream and salsa.. or anything else you like.

I followed the directions of others and toasted both sides. Actually I put the sliced french bread on a cookie sheet in the oven set at 425. Then I put the sasa, chicken and cheese on top of the toasted bread and put it back in the oven at the same temp. Turned out perfect and even my picky over 20 year old son loved it. Great recipe.

OMG delicious!!  excellent, must try recipe! it was so good! i just realized in re-reading the recipe that i didn't measure the taco seasoning, just used the whole package. i used jarred red peppers added after the onion cooked in place of the fresh one i didn't have. flavor was great all around! hubby loved it. will definitely make this again! so easy and flavorful!

There is a recipe here for taco seasoning that is wonderful. Taco Seasoning I from Bill Echols. It is so much better than store bought and very quick and easy to make. I make up a huge batch and keep it on hand for recipes that call for taco seasoning. Also, you can regulate what goes in and adjust to your taste. Enjoy!!!

We made these a couple of weeks ago, and when I accidently recommended them to laughingmagpie on the RE, it reminded me to review them!  They are awesome!  We had made fajitas the night before and used the leftover meat and veggies for this, so we halved the recipe, and thought this was a winner!  We loves the sauce, and and thought the french bread was a nice change from tortillas.  We will absolutely be adding this into the monthly rotation! The BF told me to pick the stuff up for it again this week!  Thanks laughingmagpie!

These were sooooo good. They were spicy, cheesy, and delicious. I used red, yellow, and green bell peppers (half of each one) with half an onion. I used two and a half chicken breast for three large sandwiches. I didn't get the tomoato juice so I just left it out and they were still wonderful. Another plus is they were quick to make. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe came out very good. The only thing I did different was used green peppers from my garden to use them up. I will use the red peppers from now on. The green was a little bitter. But this recipe is a keeper for me. Thanks! Oh & thanks for the tip on toasting the bread. It would have been very soggy if I hadn't done that.

Mmmm good!  My husband devoured three pieces of this.  I cut them a bit smaller though; I also topped them with avacado slices.  For my fussy eaters, I made a few with only the meat, cheese, and salsa.  Great idea LMP!

I'm a mom of six (soon to be seven)so I really liked the ease of this recipe.  We all love Mexican style food so everyone liked this one.  Not one complaint, except that I either should have had my broiler setting on Lo or I should have had the rack one position lower because I charred the edges of a couple. That was easy enough to fix by cutting that off.

This was so delicious. Very nice flavor. I used a green bell pepper instead of red and also used texas toast as that is what I had on hand. Thanks for a great lunch today.

These were OK, but a bit soggy and not a lot of flavor. Could be better with some tweaks, but I think we'll just stick with regular fajitas.

Used this recipe for inspiration:
cooked chicken with fajita seasoning packet, added red onion and dash of jalapenos. Cooked for a minute or two. Added diced tomatoes from a can (drained). Cooked a bit, added a dash of garlic. Cooked more until juices were thick. Began toasting french bread. Put some mild cheddar on toasted bread, topped with chicken/veggie mixture and then more cheese. Broiled to meld together. Make sure you don't leave it in there too long. 
Duh-lecious

I opted out of the bread and made it a dip.  I followed directions, but doubled recipe.  After sauteing chicken, onion, and peppers in a skillet-I dumped every thing in a crock-pot, added a can of cream of chicken, and simmered.  Served with tortilla chips.  Hope it's a hit!

I never change a recipe before I try the original, however I did not have bread worthy of a melt and no taco seasoning. I made the recipe according to direction subbing cumin and fajita season for taco season. (Put it on meat when browning too) I made some rice seasoned with cilantro and lime juice. Put the rice in a shallow baking dish and pour chicken mix over it, then the cheese. Very good, I must say!  Next time I will make sure I have some nice bread on hand. Thanks for the recipe

I loved these, and so did my children.  I really thought my kids wouldn't like them as they hate anything with peppers but they actually gobbled these up without saying anything about the pepper.  Love this one, will keep it as a great lunch recipe.

Great and easy recipe. I reduced the natural liquid in the pan before adding the tomato juice. Glad I did as there was a lot of juice. I added fresh cilantro, just because I love it, and I toasted the bread first. Other than that, I did it all the same. 

For once, everyone at the table loved the same thing at the same time! That's rare in our house!

I wasn't wild about this recipe, and I love fajitas.  The tomato juice didn't work as well as just doing fajitas like the fajita seasoning packet states.  If I were to make these again, I would cook them the regualr way, without the tomato juice.  I just didn't care for the flavor.  Also, the recipe calls for slices of french bread.  Don't slice the bread first, slice it after it's been cooked.  I agree with other reviewers that the bread needs toasted/broiled first to avoid getting soggy.  I think this recipe would work better with steak fajitas as it would kind of be like a philly cheese steak with a twist.  Overall I'm glad I tried this, but I would rather just make plain fajitas.

This was really good.  I didn't have the bell pepper and had to substitute tomato sauce for the tomato juice since that was all I had on hand.  Our favorite part was the toasty, crunchy bread (which we did toast first then add the toppings and broil long enough to melt the cheese).  The chicken was really tender and we loved all the flavors.  I thought itwas really mild and my 6 and 8 year old would love it, but they didn't.  But my husband said it was kind of like a torta since I used bolillo rolls and it was the second best torta he has ever had.  We both loved it and would make it again.  I loved how quick and easy it was to make.

Great recipe.  I just used my homemade fajita seasoning and it was still great (and added some garlic as we love it)!  I only had a few pieces of french bread left and made the rest on tortillas.  For us we will definetly make this again, but only use the french bread.  The crunchiness of the bread just gives it something extra!  Great receipe

We really liked this - the flavor was right on and it was so easy to make.  I also used fajita seasoning instead of taco flavored. I made them for work so I didn't get a chance to broil it, just microwaved it and served on sandwich thins.

I love open face melts and this one is really good. I had to scale the recipe down, which came up with odd ingredient amounts, so I only loosely followed that part of the recipe. The flavor is great, and the idea is terrific. We never do fajitas because they really aren't sutiable for young kids, so this is a great alternative. Thanks!

Great meal ...though I must admit to doing it a little differently ....I omitted the tomato juice (due to some reviews that said the bread was soggy) and since it is titled "Fajita melt"  I couldn't see using a taco seasoning when right next to that in the grocery store is Fajita seasoning ... so I used fajita seasoning ..... VERY tasty ... husband and kids loved it , and requested I try it with steak next time.

I think I'm in the minority here in that I *liked* that the tiny bit of salsa collapsed the bread a little, making it easier to bite. My bread did not fold in on itself or lose structural integrity at all :-) [EDIT 10/1/10: In looking my review over, I should note: I used my French bread in the style of French-bread-pizzas, so the bottom side was tough crust. It may very well have collapsed had I cut it into 1/2 inch slices but I misread the directions originally.] While this didn't taste at all like fajitas to me, it DID taste very good, and I'm sure I'll make it again. Thanks for the recipe, LMP!

Great Recipe to Tailor to Your Family - toasted the bread under the broiler, then rubbed a garlic clove over it.  Sauteed the chicken using my own taco seasoning mix (chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder).  On the toasted bread I placed chopped lettuce, the chicken, and chopped onion. Added two tablespoons of Tostido's salsa con verde. Added chopped tomato and topped w/shredded cheddar cheese. Placed under the broiler to finish them off -- yummy!

Very delicious!  It was easily made into a low carb meal for me by using low carb wraps.  The edges got a little crispy under the broiler.  Yum!

I made a lot of changes to these, but I think that I did enough to retain the overall flavor. I made my own taco seasoning because I can't stand the packaged stuff. I used a thicker cut of bread and toasted it before assembly. I also marinated the sliced chicken in the seasoning and a bit of oil and grilled it outside, then sauteed onions (no peppers...we don't like bell pepper). I added chicken and onions and cheese to each sandwich and then grilled them as sandwiches in the panini maker instead of making them open-faced melts. I passed salsa and sour cream at the table and everyone LOVED them. I know this is a lot of changes, but I just liked the idea of the panini and I wouldn't have attempted it without your idea. Thanks!

Made this dish for a party last night and it was a big hit.  This is an easy dish to prepare.  I made the chicken mixture earlier in the day, when ready to eat, I microwaved the chicken mixture for a couple of minutes and placed on bread and baked.  The changes I made were:  I used a store bought rotisserie chicken, a whole onion sliced, a whole red pepper sliced, a package of fajita seasoning mix, and 3/4 cup of tomato juice.  I did not measure the amount of cheese I used either.  Will be making again.

I made this for a quick lunch and boy, was it good! I made it just for myself so I scaled it way down. I used mini-rolls because... well that's what I had and because I like tiny food. It makes me feel like a giant. Anyway - I ate them open faced on the tiny rolls and they were GREAT. I would serve them like that, tiny, as appetizers at a fancy party! Super yum...( used my own taco seasoning blend)

This was quick and easy to make. My husband and I both liked it. I used tomato sauce instead of juice because that's what I had. It worked well in making a thick coating for the chicken. I will make this again.

These are quick, easy and delicious.  I followed the directions for the most part but I did cube my chicken and veggies to make it easier for my kids to eat.  I did not use the tomato juice because I didn't need it.  The only thing I will do differently is to slice my bread 1 inch thick.  When we made these the first time through, they were a little soggy because the French bread was a little too thin at 1/2 inch thick.  I had a small amount of leftover filling which I made for lunch the next day.  I reheated the filling and sliced my leftover bread 1 inch thick and they were perfect.  Hubby said these need to go into our regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

We really liked this but I don't think there is anything "fajita" about it. In my opinion Fajitas are grilled and this is far from it. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this and will make it again, but don't be disappointed when it doesn't taste like fajitas. Also: we made this again but with a BBQ chicken twist and ohhh so yummy.

Very good, I broiled my bread first put the chicken mixture on top, then the salsa and cheese. So it wouldn't be soggy.  I also did this with beef as well. Yummy for sure.

Okay, I don't like Salsa, so I knew I wouldn't give it 5 starts.  I ate the chicken part without the salsa.  We did this as a lab in school and the teenagers seemed to think it was okay.  I would make this again for my family without the salsa.  I can't eat bread, but trust me the filling itself was very tasty alone.  I also used hot and spicy taco seasoning because I like that "kick".  The students used "original".  I think this would actually go over great as an appetizer for a football party also.

Wonderful! Very easy too! I had some chicken fajita meat that was precooked but not seasoned so I used that, also I used 2 Tbls of "Chicken taco" seasoning, other than that stuck to the recipe. It was fantastic, I can't wait for lunch tomorrow so I can eat the leftovers!

This certainly is a different delicious way to enjoy chicken. I cooked my chicken almost all the way through first and removed from heat while the peppers and onion cooked. Then added chicken back in with the seasonings. I can see how easy it is to over cook the chicken.. Especially after the broiling. I added 2 cloves of garlic as well. I like the addition of avocado as another reviewer suggested, and will try that next time. Thanks for a simple quick yet still tasty dish.

Turned out pretty well, though I had to cook them for a lot less time as my broiler was quite compact and piping hot. Just watch what you're doing--otherwise you might burn the sandwiches to a crisp!

Overall, pretty good. I changed a bit as some of my ingredients weren't available. I used a small can of tomato sauce for the juice...didn't seem to matter. I also had to make these in tortillas...as my bread ended up having a hole. I am excited to try this again on bread!!! ((My family ate these up so it is a great recipe for us!!))

A few of the family members really liked this and a few just thought it was OK.  I'm going to try it again with a different bread since the one I tried was too crusty.  By the time I baked it in the oven, the bread's crust got too hard.  Maybe that will make all the difference.

this recipe is great.  Will cook chicken and vegs separately next time.  Chicken got too done.  Served over cornbread--delicious.

Great taste! I didn't like the idea of the recipe on the French bread so is used corn tostadas instead. A great flavor combination.

We loved this one! Simple and fast! I did use tomato soup because I usually have that on hand and tomato juice, not so much. We didn't like the salsa on it though. It was okay but liked it better without.

Used almost 2 pounds of chicken tenders sliced; one large vidalia onion, 1 1/2 red bell pepper; a whole packet of taco seasoning; and, did not measure the salsa, just spread it on the bread.  Cooked the thinly sliced onion and bell pepper till tender and then browned the chicken and added the veges back in before making the sauce.  We just toasted the french bread halves and did not slice until cooked.  We did not measure the cheese either.  This was great and completely gone between the 5 of us.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a hit with the whole family.  I got all thumbs up to make again.  I didn't add the bell pepper.  I would have liked it, but nobody else likes bell pepper.  Recipe is wonderful as written.

Yum!  I did change one thing to save time, I cut a loaf of french bread in half the long way and scooped out some of the insides, then filled it as the recipe noted, broiled until warm and bubbly.  Cut and served to my family who loved it!  Sorry, I usually hate it when people make alterations, but sometimes it's helpful!

Delicious! My husband was skeptical when I served these, saying he would prefer to have the filling inside a tortilla.  After one taste, he changed his mind.  The "melt" is a nice change.  It was well liked by all!  I followed the recipe exactly, except used 3 fairly large chicken breast halves.  Look forward to serving this again.

This was a fantastic and easy dish.  I had to substitute the tomato sauce with tomato soup because I had no sauce and it was still unbelievable.  I think next time I'll toast the bread a bit before loading everything on though

Unfortunately, I have to give this a 3 star. It was edible but nothing special. I think it has potential to be so much better. The bread needs to be lightly toasted or broiled before putting the salsa and chicken misture on it or it becomes seriously soggy. With some tweaking, I think this recipe could be far better than it currently is.

Great flavor for a melt on top of French bread.  Instead of using tomato juice which sometimes can be hard to find in smaller quantities, I mixed tomato sauce with salsa.  Worked great and added a little heat to the mixture.  Used that same mixture to lightly cover bread before putting mixture on.  Felt that too much salsa on bread would make it a little soggy.

Yes. it was very good and fast. I often eat fajitas and am always looking for a way to make them better as I am a bland cook unless i follow a recipe :)  It was slightly better than I expected. I think the french bread makes all the difference.  Thanks

Has possibilities, but needs modification: (1)tomato juice is not necessary.  (2) try more taco seasoning.(3) do not use French bread - need something with a flat bottom. I used two cans of BJ's chicken.  Only need one.

Great flavor, and VERY easy to make, so that is also a + in my book. Fills you up rather quickly. My oldest child liked it, but my younger one didn't like it as much. I would make it again though!

Sounds great ... haven't tried it yet but when I do, I'll use Morningstar Farms vegetarian chicken strips or Quorn vegetarian chicken tenders (fabulous, esp the latter) ... can't wait to give it a try! Gave it 5 stars cause most everyone else did, and I know how good this is gonna be! ;)

I made this for lunch today, very easy and simple recipe. I didn't have any red bell pepper so I used green bell pepper instead, and I used whole wheat English muffin instead of french bread.

Interesting idea, but I didn't really find it to be "great".  Perhaps just too far from the original tortilla-style fajita for me.

Wow. My husban loved it. Funny thing about it was we didn't have tomato juice, but we did happen to have V8, worked justed as good, but we both decided to choose a salsa that had more heat. ^__^ Thanks for posting!

Made it twice. Toasted bread is the key. Used V8 juice because that’s what I had. Avocado was good to use.

I made this according to the recipe except for 2 things which I changed.
I added a little more Taco Seasoning and I did not use it over bread. I used it as a layered Nacho dish with a little cheese.
it was A HIT at the table.
we will be making more of this again!
thank you for the recipe!

It's a great recipe if you're looking for a cheap, quick dinner. My family and myself enjoyed it. If I was to make it again, I would slightly toast my bread before topping it and less salsa.

I cooked it a lot less than 5 minutes under the broiler because if you cook it longer the cheese turns too hard! Other than that, love the recipe and will definitely make again!

My husband and I loved this! It was very delicious. I used Rotel Chipotle Tomatoes rather then just the tomato sauce, it added another hint of spice and extra taste along with the salsa.

I made this tonight and it tasted great. I used medium heat salsa which I think kicked up the flavor because I don't think it would have had enough seasoning if I didn't. Husband loved it and said it was a keeper recipe. Thanks for sharing!  :)

This is pretty quick and easy to make.  I used leftover chicken breasts and skipped ahead to the sauce. When assembling, I spread salsa verde on soft tortilla shells instead of salsa,  it turned out really good.  Thank you for the recipe, I will be using it regularly I'm sure.

This was delicious, however I did tweak the recipe a bit. Instead of using bread, I made Spanish rice then layered the rice then the chicken and veggies on top of the rice in a casserole dish. I then continued with the salsa and cheese, then under the broiler as the recipe says. My whole family LOVED it.

Tasted amazing! I would recommend toasting the bread before adding the salsa. Otherwise the salsa soaks in and makes the bread a little soggy.

Very good recipe! This is the first time I tried it. Though not exactly as written as I added more taco seasonimg. I will make it again, and will try different subtle changes like avocado and tomato.

This was a good recipe but I would make a few changes.  Instead of coating the bread with salsa first, I would add it to the chicken mixture before it all goes on the bread.  I would also toast the bread first, then add the chicken mixture and top with cheese, toast again under the broiler to melt cheese and finally serve.  I did end up using almost a cup of tomato juice instead of 1/2 cup but I like things a bit saucier.  My family liked it and I would make it again.  Just didnt LOVE it.

My boyfriend loved it, however it wasn't my favorite. Definitely worth trying again though! We think maybe we need to toast the bread first so it doesn't get soggy and we thought that we might have put too much toppings on them, so we'll try it again!

This is a great no thinking weekday meal for the family; however, it is not very exciting. I will make it again as a quick meal after work sometime.  My husband called it a quick fajita pizza.

This is our go-to recipe for chicken fajitas and a family favorite for an easy, quick, and tasty dinner! The only variation I use is to put the mixture on soft flour tortillas instead of bread. I serve it up with cheese, sour cream, and salsa. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

This was very good. I doubled the tomato sauce, and added crushed red pepper. I did grill the chicken but that is just personal preference. I sprinkled Mrs. Dash grilled chicken over the chicken while grilling.

This was amazing! Of course, I made a couple of changes. After a long day, frozen veggies also worked for me. And following a reviewers comment, I sliced the French bread in half and made it open faced. Added a Mexican blend of cheeses and home made pico and guacamole. Will definitely make this again!

I made them for the family and they were gone like lightening. Only thing I would do different next time is to toast the French bread before dressing. A little to soggy for my family.

Thank you for the awesome recipe! everyone in my family loved it! I used black beans in place of chicken on a few of them to accommodate my mother who's a vegetarian. I recommend this recipe! I think it would be great for parties.

This is really good. Disappeared in my house. We did not use the French bread, but probably will next time. Fam in tortilla mode, and that's what they used. Thanks for a new chicken dish to make! :)

Instead of putting the chicken and sauce on top of bread,  I putt it on top of rice and then baked it for 5 minutes. Turned out to be really yummy! I would recommend the modification and extra paprika and oregano adds a great flavor.

Thought this was a neat take on fajitas and a melt.  It was easy to make and it was pretty tasty. I did take other's advice and  toasted my bread.  In fact, I added a bit of butter and garlic salt.

Pretty good - as I listened to other commenters to toast the bread. Also cooked the chicken way shorter, frying for 5 minutes almost makes bites of chicken breast ready and cooking them 17 more minutes would kill the chicken all over again. (it's not necessary even for contamination reasons). 3 minutes frying over high heat at the beginning, then take the chicken pieces out of the pan and keep until the veggies are done, only throwing the chicken in for another minute near the end of the boiling-down the liquid. 

My son gave it top marks and we'll definitely make this again.

Making it for dinner as I speak.  Substituted taco sauce and some water for the tomato juice...added a squeeze of a lime and cilantro...just personal preference.  So far it tastes delicious...serving with sweet potato fries...yummee !!

I made no modifications to the recipe.  My husband liked it, but I was not impressed.  Unfortunately, it tasted more like a taco melt than a fajita melt.  I will not be making it again unless my husband specifically requests it.

New family favorite. I didn't have bread on hand so I layered recipe in a 9x13. First chicken, veggies, sauce, cheese covered it and baked in 350* oven for 30 minutes covered 10 additional minutes uncovered. Also once I added 1/4 c ranch dressing to sauce. Yummy

doesn't make very good leftovers, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Good taste, very quick which is great for a meal in a hurry. I used texas bread because I'm not good at slicing bread.  and I toasted it before hand to keep it from getting soggy. It's very filling which is great!

The kids loved it and it was quick and easy to make.  I didn't have any taco seasoning so I used a chili packet.  I toasted the bread first and added asparagus + a few tablespoons of diced jalapenos.

A good idea for Fajita's! Was alright. My boyfriend really liked it and I thought it was okay. Next time I will use different salsa because it made it taste weird.

DD mutinied at the idea of the french bread so I used tortillas, but I used the rest of the recipe as written and loved it.  Tomato juice as sauce, who would have thought it would work so well. Thanks LMP!

Very good, very easy recipe. Just to be different, I went with Chibatta (sp?) rather than French, also because the store sold them in smaller sizes and i didn't want that much left over. Also, i happened across shredded cheese that already had taco seasoning. With no seasoning to put into the skillet with the chicken, perhaps that's why I got a very thin sauce with the chicken. But really good, so much neater than chicken fajitas!

This was very good. My husband loved it. I didn't ready the directions very well and dumped the entire pckg of taco seasoning, however I just added a bit more tomato juice. This receipe will get added to the dinner rotation. Thanks.

Very tasty! I only used 3 chicken breasts but the same amount of taco seasoning and juice. It turned out perfect. I used 3/4 loaf of french bread and it was delicious. We will definately make this again!

Incredible sandwich.  I made this exactly as is (well, plus the addition of a little bit of guacamole after I took it out of the broiler) and it was excellent.  Great flavor, and surprisingly not messy.
