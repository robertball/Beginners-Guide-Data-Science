I made these last summer in my first attempt to jar food, which actually turned out to be a wonderful experience!  These pickles were absolutely awesome and really easy to make!   The only thing I did different was can them. Everyone that had them thought they were wonderful and I had many requests for more jars.  I only made 1 case of small jars and 3 large mason jars full, but this coming summer I am planning to be a little more ambitious and make more.  I did make one variation on some of the jars which I think came out fantastic and that was that I had dehydrated red cayenne peppers and I added 1 to some of the smaller jars and 3 or 4 to the large jars.  Not only did it add color to the jar, but they really tasted great, especially if you are a spice fan!  I added more onion to my pickles as that was the way that I remembered them from my childhood.  My Nanny made some of the best Bread and Butter pickles that I have ever tasted....these are certainly close to her recipe!:)

These turned out great!  Following others' advice, I only used 1/2 cup of sugar (which was plenty), and I added 1 clove of fresh garlic (minced) and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes.  Microwaved for 8 minutes, and they taste fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I never liked bread and butter pickles until I went to Lambert's restuarant.  I tried their's and fell in love.  I craved them day after day after that, but the restaurant is 2 hours from my town.  I made this recipe and behold! I now do not have to drive any distance to enjoy them.  I signed up with this website just to write this review!  I mean it...TOP NOTCH!

OK - yum!!!!!  But I do love bread and butter pickles!  I followed this recipe to a T (didn't decrease the sugar at all).  I'm a Southerner at heart and love the sweetness.
They were quick and easy although I did try doubling and tripling which caused me to have to microwave them a bit longer.
I tried making them with and without garlic and didn't notice a big difference but didn't add that much garlic.  I also tried totally peeling the cukes as I felt the skins were a bit tough but they just didn't look the same.
After filling the hot jars, I stuck them in a boiling water bath for about 10 minutes and they sealed immediately so I can enjoy throughout the winter.
I used regular cukes (not English) and sweet Vidalia onions.  IN fact, I may have added a bit more onion than called for.
Next time I may add a bit of sweet red pepper for color.
I gave some to my friend and she said her mom CRIED when she ate them as they reminded her of the pickles she helped her Mom make when she was a kid.  That's a true testimony!

These pickles are absolutely delicious and easy.  I only used 2/3 cup sugar for a little less sweetness.  In a couple batches I added a variety of peppers from my garden.  Great recipe!  One more thing, it says 1 cucumber and I used about 5 pickle size cucs.

So easy, so quick, so good! Better make a double batch cause they don't last long. You can eat them as soon as they get cold!

Really great. Exactly what I wanted and took less than no time to make. I did can half the recipe in a boilng water bath and those were a bit limp when I opened them later, but the ones that were not processed were fantastic. I'll definitely be making them again.

Wonderful!  Didn't have any of the "right" ingredients and it still worked!!  This was sooooo easy.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use a lid so I used my vented pampered chef micro safe container.  I used zucchini (which is abundant in my garden right now), mustard powder for mustard seed, 1/2 the sugar (because it was noted you could and we are on a budget), cider vinegar for white vinegar, pickling spice for celery seed, turmeric and a pinch of curry powder (because I love it).  And, it was still fabulous.  So happy I'm going to try it on carrots tonight!! :o)

We have never made pickles before and this was the easiest and most delious bread and butter pickles that we could ever imagine.  They taste like mom used to make!  I was giving the receipe to a friend and they don't have any jars, do you suppose you could just use a tight fitting rubbermaid bowl or something like that.  We will be making these again and there is no need to buy Bread and Butter Pickles in the store again.

These can be canned for longer term storage by completing the recipe, prepping your lids and jars as normal for canning, and then filling the jars to 1/2" from the top with the hot pickles, sealing and boiling for 15 min.  Let the jars sit for 12 hours undisturbed before sealing completely.  If the lids have not sealed, refrigerate and eat within 2-3 weeks.

Very easy, very good.  However, I am not one for "refrigerator pickles".  I made enough at one time, using proportionate amounts, to make 5 large jars (I use the mason jars that come with Classico and other pasta sauces) at a time.  I cook them right in the jars, filling with only 1/2 jar of liquid to avoid boilover, then top off with the remaining pickling liquid I've kept simmering on the stove.  Leave 1/2" head space and cap immediately.  Voila!  CANNED B & B pickles!

These taste great and are SOOOO simple!  I've made them three or four times for get-togethers and everyone has loved them.  I shorten the time to cool by sticking them in the freezer for a couple of hours.

I have made these many times and I just LOVE them.  They take me back to whenI was a kid helping make grandma's b&b pickles, but with the far less work.  Definite keeper that I will make over and over ... thanks for sharing.

Make sure you allow the vinegar mixture to COMPLETELY cool down or your pickles will be limp....otherwise a wonderful recipe...perfect combination.

I love it! Was always afraid to try pickling because of mess or fear of canning problems. Dad has way too many cucumbers coming in as usual so I gave it a try. It was fun, easy and delicious! I cut sugar to 1/2 cup which was sweet enough for me. Made two pints last night and six tonight. Probably be making more once I take them to work =) Thanks for sharing!

Another recipe of which I was initially in doubt, however I was quickly converted.  These are excellent, especially for the time involved and store very well in the refridgerator - I have kept batches several months and they are still wonderful.  I have found that one can easily triple the recipe, but you should add another quarter of the time to the microwaving (i.e. instead of 24 minutes, do about 32 minutes in the microwave - 8 minutes apart with a stirring at the end of each 8 minutes.).  Also, adding one garlic clove, finely minced, imparts a very nice flavor.  Vidalia onions have been my favorite for the onion and I usually double the amount of onion called for in the recipe.  Great recipe and a hit with all relatives and people at work so far!  Bueno!

My sister sent me the link to this recipe, and we both spent the summer addicted to these pickles.  They're so good, and so easy to make.  If you have a mandoline, it really makes these a snap!

I make these every year. My friends and family rave about them and always want a jar due to the fact we have a nice garden. Great taste, but I agree with cutting the sugar in half. Excellent fast recipe.

Thank you for a great recipe. My daughter is nuts for b and b pickles. She gave her highest praise. "They taste like they came right out of the jar from the store." I also think a lot of variations could be fun.

Pickles are too sweet for our taste.  Next time try... NO sugar?

Changes:
No mustard seeds
1/2 tsp celery seed
added whole peppers (need to be microwaved longer)
added sundried tomato slices (bad idea)

The BEST pickle I've EVER MADE.  I could hear my son crunching on them from across the kitchen.  Followed everything, but added a little less sugar- about 3/4 cup.  Also processed for 10 minutes immediately after canning in a boiling waterbath, just in case.  Now...off to find more cucumbers... THANK YOU!!

These are great!! And so easy!!  I did add a little garlic the second time I made them - both were wonderful.  One of the best things about this is that it makes a small quantity.  There are only 2 of us now at home (empty nesters)and it is so hard to find recipes for 2 persons.   Can you make dill pickles this same way also?  
Happy cooking to all!!

This is a great recipe, however it is posted with one mistake.  The recipe I have calls for 3 cucumbers. I thought the amount of sugar was too high when I first tried the recipe I have and wow not enough fluid, but when you microwave the cukes the natural moisture comes out of them almost like adding water to the batch.  This is why people only using 1 cucumber are saying its too sweet.  You will have more than enough fluid to put in the jars.  Make this simple change and you will think these are the best Bread and Butter Pickles ever!!

Very Yummy! Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes per another's review and a couple of mini bell peppers just to add some color. I'm not sure they'll make it to the fridge cuz my boyfriend won't stop eating them! He said the peppers are really good, too.

These were really easy and taste great,almost like the ones my mom used to make. I stored my in canning jars and simply turned the sealed jar upside down (immediately while the liquid is still really hot) and the lids sealed. I use this trick when making jam too. I would like the pickles a little crisper so next time I will try microwaving them only 5 minutes instead of 7.

My Mother used to make a version of these using Zuchinni Squash. I have used this recipe for cucumbers and the sqaush.  I did add 2-3 garlic cloves and my husband loves them. I also use thicker slices that take a bit more time to get to crispy cooked.

Very delicious and easy! Perfect for that lonely cucumber in the produce bin of the fridge that I discover on "clean the fridge day". I used a red onion the first time (it really was a clean the fridge day) and came out with very pretty pink pickles!

These are awesome, but I took quite a bit of liberty with the recipe.  I used:

2 sliced cucumbers
1/2 finely sliced onion
dash of finely chopped celery
3/4 cup vinegar
1/2 cup sugar
1 tbsp yellow mustard
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp tumeric

They came out great like this after about 9 minutes in the microwave.

Just be sure to cut really thick slices of cucumber because mine weren't thick enough and it really messed it up.  I gave a four because the pickles didn't have as much flavor as I like.  When I make pickles again I'll add peppers or something to give a little more flavor.

Wow, I was skeptical, but thought why not.  I would give 10 stars if possible.
I followed the recipe exactly except I did not have mustard seeds and used dry mustard.
The result is the pickles are crisp and very close to that of my favorite store bought brand (which I shall not buy again).  Thank you very much!

I made these today with cucumbers from our garden. I made one regular batch (using 1/2 cup Splenda instead of sugar) and one batch I added 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and 1 clove of minced garlic as one reviewer suggested. Both are fab!!

These were very easy to make, hence the good rating. Nevertheless, they did come out a little too vinegary for us and needed a little more flavor. I will use this method again with another vinegar and spice combination. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! Incrediable. Easy to prepare. Amazing outcome in a short period of time. I followed the directions as stated. The only change that I would possibly make is decreasing the sugar by just a bit. But that would be it. Thank you for an easy recipe that doesn't compromise on taste or quality!!!!!!

Couldn't believe how well these turned out! Made exactly as directed, but left out the onions as no one else in my family would have ate them. Even my skeptical dad said these were great. While they did turn out a bit limp, they still had wonderful B&B flavor. Will check out other reviews to see how people kept them from going limp during cooking. Great recipe!

We just love the flavor of these pickles! I've made them twice thus far and the first time i cooked in microwave as instructed and was happy with everything except the skins got wrinkly and tasted tough but the onions were out of this world!! Second time I made them I skipped the cooking process all together and put them in the brine and straight into the fridge to chill for a few weeks. If your patient this produces a yummy crisp pickle!
 Either way a great tasting recipe! 
FYI, I found this out by accident but the first time I made these the store was out of mustard seed so I used mustard powder and they were just as good if not better than just mustard seed plus in lent in giving pickles some more color.

Made these yesterday.  It was fast and simple.  Smelled great when cooking.  Tasted even better afterwards.  Ended up making 16 pints of these buggers.  I will be making these again in new pint mason jars and giving them as Christmas gifts!  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I tried it for the first time last night. My husband sampled a bite straight from the microwave and said it tasted as good as he remembered from his childhood on his grandparents' farm.  I put it in canning jars hot from the microwave and they sealed well, so it is now chilling in the fridge.  Some reviewers liked it with less sugar, and I think I might try that next (yes, I am making more TONIGHT!)  I also want to try a batch made with Splenda, for my diabetic and dieting friends. I'm going to try using green tomatoes instead of cucumbers, too.  This will definitely be one of my Holiday treat gifts!

These are one of the best bread and butter pickles I have ever eaten….and so easy….I have made 15 pints, 6 quarts of these and still making them…I was given 4 full paper grocery sacks of cucumbers……. I have added Garlic, habaneras, chili peppers to some of them…… Microwave them put them in sterile jars and seal with the proper sterile canning lid…… wait two or 3 days and enjoy them… Please let me know how you like them if you make them…… Kathy

These came out really great!  I never made pickles before so this is all new to me.  So easy!  My hubby doesn't like dill pickles so he'll be happy to have some bread and butter ones...if they make it until he returns from Argentina.  I think I'll end up having to make more.  I followed the recipe exact excep I only used 1/2 an onion since it was a really big onion.  I sliced the cucumber in my food processor which made thin slices, I think next time I will used my mandoline and make them a bit thicker.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was so easy! turned out great. I added a little garlic like the others but also added some zucchini strips and some diced red pepper. *Update* I am trying to cut back on sugars and have used splenda/nutrisweet in place of the sugar. GREAT!! Have been making them like this a few years and no one can tell the difference. ZERO weight watchers points like this by the way

This recipe was awesome!  It was my first time making cooked pickles.  It is wonderful to have a recipe that doesn't make tons of pickles.  I did add a little garlic.  They tasted just like the real thing, with a lot less work!!!

It was so fun to make this from the cucumbers in my garden.  The first 2 jars where gone in one night when neighbors stopped to visit.  I may plant more next year just to make these pickles!

These are great and I gave them to neighbors and friends as gifts. They all wanted the recipe. I will definitely be making these again. My brother could hardly wait to make a ham on rye sandwich with them!

I would give this more stars if possible.  Made them for a family picnic and everyone went wild!  Passed the recipe on to family who then passed it on to their in-laws and friends, who passed it on, and on and on!  I can't keep them in the house!  I didn't even change a thing.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Who knew making B&B pickles could be this easy?!  I had 2 large cucumbers left over from this past summer's crop sitting in the fridge - I made cucumber salad, gaspacho soup and many other wonderful recipes from this site, but frankly, was all 'cuked out until I saw this recipe.  Wow, so easy to make (19 minutes) and the taste/texture (nice and crunchy) is good.  I used a whole white onion, will probably use less onion next time, and I'll make it a sweet one instead.  The onion and two pickles filled a large mason jar PERFECTLY, and produced enough "juice" to cover it all.  Will definitely be using this recipe for next year's harvest.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  This was my first attempt and will be making often.  I did decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup like others, as well as additions of celery & mustard seeds.  Love it!

Wow! Who knew this could be so easy? The brine is perfectly flavored, and you get pickles almost immediately. Use a pickling cucumber for best results.

This was my first pickling attempt, and I'm really pleased with how they came out! I used large vidalia onions, so I used probably less than half of an onion per patch.

I couldn't believe how good these turned out! I was really skeptical at first, but it was a worth a shot for the extra cucumbers in the garden. They are awesome! I cannot tell the difference between these and any other canned pickles. Just don't forget the sugar. ;)

I live in Japan and have a hard time getting American style pickles.  This recipe is wonderful.  I grated cucumbers, squeezed out the liquid and made relish with the leftover liquid - cooking only 5 minutes in the micro.  Great!

I have made these about 20 times now and every time I do the jar only lasts 1, mayyyybe 2, days. SO good! I put a little less than 1/2 c of sugar (dont like pickles very sweet) and as another suggested Cayenne pepper is a MUST! So good! Perfect balance of vinegary, sweet and spicy! Also a few times I have made it with ground mustard (out of seed) and I actually liked it better... I feel like it seeps in better or something. AWESOME recipe, Thank you!

Wow - I just made these today and we ate some for dinner tonight - fabulous!  I made the recipe with these changes as suggested by others on this site - I did not have the tumeric so I used paprika instead, and I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup SPLENDA.  I had a huge red onion so I used 1/2 of it for a batch (I made 2 batches).  Sliced cucumbers about a 1/4 inch thick and they were a bit crunchy - perfect!  This was so QUICK and EASY!  Thank you.  I will definitely make these again - maybe tomorrow.  And I also reused some old pickles jars and they absolutely did reseal when I put them in the fridge and I heard a satisfying pop when I opened one tonight.  I don't do canning so my jars will be happily at home in the fridge for as long as they last.

I've never made pickles before, THESE ARE GREAT. I decided to make them because they don't make a tremendous amount and it doesn't take that much time. Made 2 1/2 pints.  It makes me crazy when a recipe doesn't give better measurements than 1 cucumber and 1 onion. I used several small cucumbers ( weighed about 2.5 lbs) and one vidallia onion (weighed about a half lb). Cucumbers are much heavier because of the amout of water they contain. I was concerned because the only liquid added was vinegar. But the liquid in the cucumbers makes it enough liquid to fill the jars just right. I'll be doing these again.

Tastes great and saves me a TON of time when I'm canning a year's worth of pickles. And my family appreciates not having to air the house out to get rid of the boiling vinegar smell. I can't recommend this recipe enough.

I just found this recipe this week and holy moly was it easy and absolutely delicious! As good as grandma's but half the energy! I forgot celery seed but substituted a pinch of dill - also, the store was out of turmeric but I managed to eek a little out of their jar - didn't seem to make any big difference. I also didn't have any jars but sterilized an old pickle jar and lid - to my surprise it sealed again! I am soooo making more of these this week and probably will be making them forever more. Thanks!

I tried this using 2 cucumbers, 2/3 cup sugar and a few whole cloves in addition to the spices already called for.  After heating in the microwave for the recommended 8 minutes, I kept heating in increments of 3 minutes until the onions turned translucent.  Total heating time for this batch was 14 minutes.  This made 2 pints.  I put them in the fridge last night and just got out a jar this afternoon.  They're fabulous!  Nice and crunchy.  But with time they may get a little sweeter, so next time (SOON!) I'll probably try using just 1/2 cup sugar.  I didn't have any pepper flakes, but I'll be trying that soon, too.

I put the jars into the fridge as soon as I filled them, and they sealed nicely.  Does this mean I can store them unrefrigerated after they're sealed?  I don't have enough refrigerator space for the quantities I'd like to make.

These pickles were fast and tasted great after marinating in the fridge for a few days. However be careful because microwaves tend to create hot spots and may unevenly overcook some of the cukes. Either stop to stir frequently, or heat the liquid up first and add the cukes later. It didnt seem to affect the taste after marinating for a few days, but I wonder if it would affect the quality. Thanks for posting it though!
P.S I also love that its a recipe for one or two cukes. Most of the recipes out there are for a whole barrel of them, making it hard to accurately scale down!

WOW!!  Pickles that fast...and from a microwave, no less!  I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and placed jarred pickles while hot in the refrigerator and they sealed on their own!  Cool!  Very good and right on the money for a delicious bread & butter pickle!

This was a great recipe.  And a great concept.  I have an organic garden and we seem to harvest a little every day.  This recipe is fast and the cucumbers, bell peppers, onions still have a good crunch to them.

this are very good I've been making them for years. Funny though I found the recipe in a woman's magazine. However, I can't remember which one. It was either woman's day or family circle.

I used this recipe trying to copy some delicious home made pickles I had tasted while on holiday.  I did change it a little because I like chunky pickles, so I cut the small pickling cucumbers about 1/2 inch thick.  I also added freshed minced garlic and a couple hot chili peppers.  They turned out great, not the exact dupe but still really good.  I will definately keep this recipe for future use.  BTW I tripled the recipe for a large jar and they still came out perfectly.  My whole family liked them very much.

I was a little skeptic if the vegetables  will remain cruchy after zapping them, but I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome! I added garlic and red chilli pepper flakes like some suggested, omitted celery seeds because I was out of them, but added sliced celery and carrots instead. I cut the amount of sugar by a quarter, and threw in some bayleafs and black peppercorns which inparted a very nice flavor. It's so easy to make, I don't think I will ever need to buy pickles again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Linda!

I haven't allowed these to stand in the refrigerator long enough for the flavors to develop, but I already like them.  I was skeptical that the heat of the microwave, or rather the way the microwave heats somewhat unevenly, would make for a limp pickle.  I've canned pickles for years, but with the family shrinking, I thought I'd try this recipe.  I did double it, since I had several pickling cucumbers to use up, and they already impress me with good flavor and crispness.  I usually use cider vinegar in bread and butter pickles, but used white as the recipe stated.  I did use some mixed pickling spice instead of the mustard seed simply to use it up. The whole batch is in a large glass jar in the refrigerator, and will surely not last long. This is a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe and method.
Additional note: After keeping some for a few months in the fridge, I can say that these only improved with time.

I made these the other day and was so pleasantly surprised how easy and how good they were.  Tasted just like those I would slave over.  I would never have believed how crisp they were after one microwaved them.  Will be making these from now on.  Perfect! Would not change a thing.

we made a small garden this year and had cucumbers each day but not lots all at the same time so when I saw this recipe for microwave bread and butter pickles I thought I would try it. Well, it's true! they are the easiest thing to make but are scrumptious!!! I will definitely keep this recipe and make it as I pick my cucumbers each day. I did as one of the reviewer said and used only half the sugar. Thank you so much for sharing.

These were awesome! After reading reviews I decided to use 3/4 C sugar. I felt they were too sweet so the next batch I only used 1/2 C and they were much better. Sure will be doing these again! Thanks for sharing!

These are incredibly easy to make and taste great!  I had a fantastic cuke crop last summer and made a ton of pickles.  I added some red pepper flakes to some and garlic to a few others and they all were great.

Many compliments from all on this recipe. I used the suggestions of others, such as using 1/2 the sugar, and using papricka instead of the tumeric. I also added different varities of peppers. This recipe is SO easy and very tasty. This will be a keeper!!

This was so easy and tasted great. I used splenda instead of sugar, and didnt have any onions, someone told me to just use the pickling spices, so I tried that and it was great. You just have to try to judge how much of it to put in. I guess I judged right because my boyfriend is a bread and butter pickle junkie and he thought they were great.

I cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup as I dont like my pickles too sweet and that worked well for me. I wasn't sure if the cucumber would go limp what with it boiling for so long but it was Great! I couldnt wait to taste this and I loved the flavour! This recipe is awsome!

Absolutely delicious!!!!!!  I would recommend cutting the cucumber slices thinner (not too thin) versus thicker.  I also recommend letting the pickles chill out in the freezer for a few days before sampling.  They are so wonderful - you'll be impressed that you made them in the microwave!  My grandmother who works so hard each year to can her on pickles the old fashioned way will never believe me when I share this with her!
This is a keeper!

I've been making these pickles (year round) for a long time.  They are a great taste of summer in the heart of the winter! My recipe is only a little bit different in that I use 3 cucumbers to your one. I love the addition of peppers also.  I've tried to do a whole jar of onions, but they really need the taste of the pickles to be good.  Thanks for submitting this!

These were excellent, particularly given how quick and easy they were to make!  Perhaps not as crispy as store-bought versions, but the taste more than makes up for it! (I used half the sugar based on the many suggestions, and it was fine)

These were the BEST! They were just like eating my grandmothers. I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup to allow me to eat more at one sitting. Terrific for holiday gifting.

My daughter made these from the cucumbers in our garden.  They are really delicious and easy to make.  Though they're not crispy or crunchy, they are a great way to use up that produce.  Oh, by the way, we substituted Splenda for the sugar to save on calories.

Excellent recipe - easy to make and quite tasty. The only thing I didn't like was that after a couple of days marinating the sweetness really intensifies, overwhelming all the other flavors. Next time I'll try with less sugar.

Based on the wonderful reviews and some suggestions I cut the sugar in half and am sitting here enjoying some WONDERFUL and quick to make Bread & Butter pickles! I used 3 Kirby cucumbers instead of one large one and the recipe worked out perfectly! Thanks so much!
UPDATE: I now routinely prepare a doubled batch and add a thinly sliced (I use an adjustable Kyocera ceramic mandoline) jalapeno to that doubled batch. I only need to microwave this amount for a total of 9 minutes, though. Wherever I bring a jar of these homemade pickles I have to share the recipe!

These were great and so easy.  My Mom said these were the best pickles she ever ate in her life.  I've already made them a second time.  I'll never buy bread and butter pickles again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

All I can say is, O.M.G.!!! I'm in awe of the taste of these pickles! They're so quick and easy to make, not a huge production at all. I'm not a huge pickle fan but decided to make some for the family because cukes were on sale today. I'm going to be going back for more cukes so that I can make a winter's supply of these!  
As per other reviews, I did cut the sugar in half, and I'm glad I did, because they're plenty sweet. other than that, I followed to recipe to a "t". You all know what I'll be doing in my kitchen tomorrow!  :)

I loved this recipe so much when I used to grow my own cucumbers, so having a bag of onions to use up & none of the spices in the recipe, I made an experimental batch using only sliced onions and a heaping tsp of curry seasoning, Delicious!

Amazing. I was skeptical about microwaving pickles. They came out great. Followed recipe exactly. They were gone the first day. Now I am trying to make a bigger batch and also can them in water bath. Great recipe!

So simple! I did several batches. Recipe is perfect as is but also tried with less sugar (just as good) and with added red pepper flakes...nice and tangy! I will be using this all summer. I barely waited for them to cool before I tried them, can't wait to try them in a few days! Will be canning some for storage as well

As-is, too much onion.  I cut the cukes about 1/4" and it still takes a lot longer to soften to the consistency we prefer, but really that's all it is; preference.  Overall the spices and prep method are exactly the sweet/tangy combination I would buy in the store, it's just a matter of tweaking the shape and texture to our liking! Will make these regularly!!

A friend of mine had given me a recipe almost like this but i lost it. This is as close as i could get to it, but if i remember correctly it said to cover the pickle bowl with plastic wrap before putting in micro. They were really good and i used 3/4 sugar but 1 cup would have beeen better..I never canned them. They didn't last long. We ate them!

best ever B&B pickles.  Love the recipes that appear to be time consuming, but are so so good.  This is definitely a keeper. I did reduce to sugar and used 3/4 cup

We finally planted the vegetable garden that we've been talking about for years.  The cucumber plants are going hog wild!  I've been looking for recipes to use them up, and this one is definitely a winner.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great.  
After the family kept requesting more and more pickles, I started to worry about all of the sugar.  So, I decided to try it with Splenda.  I am happy to say that they turned out just as good!  Thanks for this quick and yummy recipe.

Delicious base recipe perfect for tailoring to your needs.  I'm giving this 4 stars only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used 1 cucumber, 1/2 an onion, and sliced them.  Put them in a bowl and added slightly less than 1/2 cup sugar, and slightly less than 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar.  Sprinkled with Mrs. Dash then microwaved for 4 minutes, stirred, 4 minutes again, then let it cool before putting in the fridge.  Yum!

I followed the recipe as written, using Splenda instead of sugar.  The cucumbers and onions came out yellow, which was ok, except it did not look like the picture.  The cucumber itself was soft and limp, but the ONIONS were delicious.  This is my new pickled onion recipe.

I love pickles, but never made them before. This recipe was easy and allows for variation ... I used cloves and added whole peppercorns. I also halved the sugar which still had them plenty sweet!! I used the English cucumbers and either these cukes are not for pickling, or else I microwaved them too long. They were not as crispy as I would like, but I will definitely used this recipie again with "normal" cucumbers.

Revised review:  Too sweet, this really needs either more vinegar, and/or less sugar.  Original review: "Pretty good!  A "fast-fix" when my Mother's, locally famous standard recipe, Bread & Butter Pickles are not available.  In this recipe I most often omit the celery seed and add 1/2 teaspoon whole cloves instead."

WEll, pickles used to freak me out (I'm 14), but I had some homegrown Asian cucumbers given to me by a friend so I used one up this way.  I had to peel them because Asian cukes' skins are spiky, but they were actually really good!  I will be making pickles again in the future, and that's high praise 4 me!  My mom loved them too.

These pickles are to die for.  I found this recipe 2 weeks ago and have made 4 batches since.  We can't keep them around.  I add a little ground pepper to the mix but it is good either way.  I tried to use the juice a second time and the pickles still turned out but not near as good as the first batch.  Thanx so much for this recipe!

This is a wonderful and easy recipe!  I scaled the recipe to 5 cucumbers so I did microwave them a little longer.  They are very addicting once you start eating them - I made them this morning and they are half gone tonight!  Thank you for making my first attempt at pickles terrific!! :)

Nice flavor.  They turned out quite soggy though, maybe because I used long english cukes or cut too thin, but tasty enough to try making them again.

Unbelievably good! A very quick and easy recipe.  I was impressed by the cucumber slices keeping a slight crunch.

I must say that no one believed that these came from a microwave, and about 12 different people have tried them after I made them.  They are awesome, taste just like homemade (the old-fashioned way) and were beyond simple.  I will definately make these again!!

These are very good and super easy to fix.  Also threw in some red pepper flakes and used an English cucumber so there are hardly any seeds. I cut the cucumber in 1/4 in. slices.  Still sweet enough for us using half the amount of sugar but don't leave out any of the spices. FYI - the tumeric will turn the onion (used 1/2 of a Texas Sweet) a funny yellow color but these are so yummy, Mom even asked if she could take some home! Thank you Linda.

Love the pickles!  The hardest thing is interpreting what a large cucumber is.  We grow our own so they're all shapes and sizes depending on the weather and when we can get to them, but I have a method now related to the size of my bowl, not the cukes.

I had doubts when I saw this recipe, but tried it anyway.  These pickles are the best I have ever made and some of the best I have ever eaten. When cold they are crispy and sweet and the onions are so good.  They don't make a big mess when you make them so clean up is quick.  I will never make bread and butter pickles any other way.

I literally JUST made these, as I was prepping them for the fridge, I decided to try one...wow...fantastic! I added about 1 tsp of garlic and reduced the sugar to 3/4C. I can't wait until they are chilled!!

It was brutal..to watch my daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren trying to see who could get the most of the first small batch I made!  These pickles are WONDERFUL.  I made several more batches and followed the advice of one person who said to turn them upside down in fridge.  They really did seal.  I couldn't believe it.  Recipe is definitely a keeper and a great way to use up the bountiful supply of cucumbers we had this year.  Thank you, Linda, for sharing!!

I was skeptical that these pickles could be this good since they were so fast and easy. Wow was I WRONG! They are amazing. I will never buy bread and butter pickles ever again. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I did not have mustard seed so I used pickling spice. I can not imagine them being any better. I did can some of them for later. I am hoping they are as good later as they are now. Try these, I do not think you will be disappointed.

These pickles defy logic.  You cook 'em til they're floppy, and somehow they come out crispy crunchy and so delicious!  What a find this recipe was for me just as my garden's produced more cukes than I knew what to do with.  These are wonderful!

These are the best Bread and Butter Pickles!!!! Love, love, love them!  I just got done making them and they're almost gone. I couldn't even wait until they cooled down to eat them.  I'm so glad I planted all those cucumbers this year.  My friends, neighbors and family will be getting these pickles.  That's if I don't eat them all myself!

I have made bread and butter pickles for several years. I have used a recipe that was very involved and the pickles were good. This recipe is great because it does not take long to prepare the pickles turn out great! I did cut the sugar in half but followed the rest of the recipe to a T. This is going to be my new pickle recipe.

I wasn't sure how these would turn out because they were so easy to make, but there were fantastic and my grandmother who has been making these for years the long way couldn't believe it. I didn't cook them quite as long because I like them a little crunchy.

Wow, I never thought that I'll ever use my microwave for cooking such  delicious dish! It was easy, fast and most important - tasty! My in-laws, my children and  husband absolutely loved it. 
I made some changes, such as: reduced the quantity of sugar to 1/3 cup and in my microwave (whirlpool) it took 6 1/2 minutes to be done. 
I'll stick to this as a basic recipe for B&B pickles.

Absolutely Yummy! These pickles are super simple to make, and taste even better than anything sold in a store.
It's perfect for a single person, or a small family. I had pickles in the fridge form start to finish in less than 20 minutes. Thanks Linda!

I have made many versions of bread and butter sweet pickles, but never found one that was easier and more delicious. I used to teach microwave cooking in the 80's and wish I had had this recipe to show off another way to use your microwave oven! Yummy!

I cut the sugar in half and cooked them in a small pan on the stove instead of the microwave about ten minutes, low flame.
Have mad them twice already.

Wow, I avoid microwave recipes normally, however I had small batch of pickling cucumbers from my garden and wanted a recipe that was small.  Decided to try this and was very impressed.  After making the first batch, had to make another as the first batch was eaten in less than an hour!  Made it exactly as recipe was written.  Might experiment with using peppers in it.

I didn't microwave the mixture and I think the pickles stayed crisper.  But, I make only one larger jar at a time and it keeps for at least three weeks in the refrigerator -- not that it's ever lasted that long!  I've added a couple of whole small garlic cloves for a little more  punch, but learned not to include more than than a couple.  I tried a 50/50 mix of apple cider and white vinegar, but the jury is still out on that one.

As others have suggested, I reduced the sugar by half.  This is SO easy and fast, and I was surprised how crisp they turned out.  Definitely will make again.

I didn't have mustard seed or celery seed so I used mustard powder and pickling spice as another cook mentioned. They were exquisite; in fact, my hubby and I had them for dessert.

I made an “experimental” batch of these.  They were excellent!  Four pickling cukes, some onion and garlic, vinegar, sugar and spices and BAM!  It took longer to assemble the ingredients than it did to can them!  I did add half a dozen whole cloves and a dash of hot pepper flakes to mine.  These are definitely a keeper!

These are delicious!  I couldn’t believe how great they were for pickles done in the microwave!  They were almost as good as my grandmother used to make.  I’ve never found an easier or tastier bread and butter pickle recipe.

Tasty and easy.  I microwaved the sugar and vinegar for 1 minute prior to adding the rest of the ingredients in order to jump start the sugar dissolving.  May add a pinch of red pepper flakes, some black peppercorns, and garlic next time.  When we finish this batch, plan to use the leftover liquid to pickle some hard boiled eggs.

These are so easy and taste just like my mom's. Next time I think I will add a bit more liquid, as I would like to can them, and there isn't quite enough brine to cover them. I have made them twice and they make about 2 cups of pickles which lasts us for about two weeks unless we have company. My co-workers love them with meat, cheese and crackers for a snack at work. Thank you for sharing.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe except cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup.   I gave these away to my family in small jars and they cannot stop raving about these pickles.

These are fabulous! I didn't change a thing and they are sooo good. I spend all summer canning and pickling as this is as good as it gets. It made 1 perfect pint jar and I ate half the  jar in one sitting.

OMG!  These are the best B&B pickles and so easy!  I've been making them for years.   I've even used zucchini, yellow squash and onion instead of cukes.  One time I used baby carrots cut  into thirds along with the cuke and onion.  My family can't get enough!   In the fall, I use Tony Chachere's creole seasoning and spice things up a bit...big hit!   Thanks for sharing Linda!

I have made these multiple times and they always come out great with rave reviews.  I have followed the recipe exactly every time and have never had a bad batch.  The only thing I would suggest is be careful with the tumeric, as it stains everything, including your counter.  These were the second pickle recipe I tried, and it works like a charm every time and no one believes they are homemade.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The only change I made was using a calorie free sweetener instead of sugar. I do not understand microwaving your cukes until tender! The next day the middles were soggy! Maybe others like soggy pickles, but...not I. Am still working on it! Flavor was great!

I was very skeptical when reading this recipe but ultimately went with it because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I mostly followed the recipe (I used slightly less sugar after reading some of the reviews) using cucumbers from my garden and they came out delicious! I had always thought making pickles would be a time-consuming, canning-pain-in-the-butt, but these tasted like I had spent all of that time when really I didn't. Awesome, quick, and easy pickle recipe.

I do not rate a lot of recipes, but I had to for this one.  I followed the recipe as written, with one exception.  I added some chopped hot peppers as we like a little spice.  These are amazing pickles.  They are almost addictive. These will be on my summer list to make going forward.

Never made pickles before and was under the impression that it was a timely, involved process.  I had several cukes I needed to use and happened to have all ingredients for this recipe.  I cannot believe how good these were!  I cut the sugar down by half (actually used Stevia so cut that 1/2 C sugar down by another third)- followed the rest to a T.  Kids and hubs couldn't stay out of them!

I give it a 5 for flavor, a 10 for easy but, maybe a 4 for texture.  I would like the cucumbers were a little more crisp.  I'm not sure if cooking them less would help.  I might try that.  Also, I used quart jars and had plenty of room for 2 whole cucumbers, maybe more.

These are killer DILLER!  To tell you the truth, I don't remember if I made any changes or not...... I spend ALOT of time in the kitchen, and I just want to say these are delicious.  
Let these set in the fridge for about 10 days or so, and WOW!

Thanks for the recipe!!

Terrific recipe!  Sooooo easy, quick and yummy!   This was my first attempt at bread & butter pickles.  I will definitely use this again next summer & double or triple the batch.   Half were canned and the other half were refrigerated.  These were a hit with everyone who tried them.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you!

I have made this in the past. It is great! ( I even use the liquid as salad dressing).  

 After making the original a few times,  I  added celery, red sweet peppers, carrots, you name it I've added it.  We eat this like a side dish.

Most importantly, this was a simple, easy to follow, fast to make, fantastic tasting recipe.   It appears that you can do anything reasonable to the ratios  and come out fine.  I ballpark estimated making 4 times the volume, using onion at about a 1:2 ratio to cucumbers.  I preferred the taste with the full sugar ratio.  Increased the microwaving time at the same 4 times ratio that I increased the components.  I remain unsure if the end result is a "canned" jar or not; interestingly the Ball Jar tops all popped in and sealed while the jar cooled in the refrigerator.  So I'll keep them refrigerated but would like to know more about whether or not this mimic canning.

I can't stop eating these! Used half the sugar (they are plenty sweet) and added a few cayenne peppers to each jar I made to add a nice kick. Sweet AND spicy, sooo good!

These are DELICIOUS!!! They taste exactly like the pickles my Mom used to make. I am so glad I found this recipe, it brings back such a rush of memories. My poor mom used to slave over the stove making these pickles... I wish she was still here so I could make her life a little easier with the microwave method!

I have made these at least 10 times. I slice everything super thin using a mandolin slicer (watch your fingers!!!) and like other reviewers, I have found that I can cut the sugar in half and they are still plenty sweet.

Thanks for such an easy way to make these. I LOVE THESE!!!!

This recipe was really good! It was quick, simple, and easy. I cut the sugar in half like the other reviews suggested, but next time I will only put in 1/4 cup because it was still a little sweet for my families taste. I also put in mustard powder instead of mustard seed. And then I didn't have any tumeric so i just cut it out and the pickles were still delicious! These will for sure be gifts to family and friends at christmas!

The pickles tasted good but cucumber skins were tough. I think they should have been cooked longer in the microwave.

Wonderfully easy!  These make a great gift with low overhead and labor if you put them in little pint jars with some gingham cloth and a ribbon...great for BBQs or the holidays as a host gift.  Very delicious.  Thank you!  This is one of the best recipes in this database.

These were just okay- we didn't even end up finishing them.  I think I may have tried following too many of the suggestions.  Next time, I'll stick to the original recipe except I don't really like the taste of the celery seed and do I really need the turmeric?  I don't like the color of the pickles with the turmeric added.
