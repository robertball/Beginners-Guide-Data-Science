I did add more chicken and double the cayenne to end up with about medium salsa level of “kick”.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  All the spices listed might scare someone away, but these are perfectly measured!  This tasted like I got it at a restaurant.  Excellent instructions for a novice Indian cuisine chef, thank you so much!!  Only problem was that we couldn’t stop craving naan while eating it!!

I have referred to this recipe twice now. I kept roughly the same seasoning proportions but made singe changes based on what was on hand as what needed to get used up in my veggie drawer. 
I added 1 sweet potato and 1 regular potato cubed along with the carrot. 
I have substituted coconut oil for the Ghee and leek for the onion. 
I added 2 medium chopped tomatoes with the coconut milk to allow for more liquid for the extra starchy veggies.  
I added 1/4 cup chopped green onion tops and 3 cups chopped fresh spinach with the frozen peas. 
That's what is shown in my photo.

Easy and flavourful.   We lean to meals in a bowl and this is high on the list.   Add rice , a grain, or noodles (or on its own) it is a winner.

Made as described, except I skipped the heavy cream.  You really don’t need it.  It is savory and delicious as is, and still plenty rich with the cream of coconut.  Truly a winner!

This one is a winner!  I loved the flavors and the peas gave it a sweetness it needed.  More importantly, my husband loved it and wanted it again for lunch.  That is a first, as he never wants the same meal twice in 2 days.  He now loves cauliflower.  BTW I used turkey breast as that was what I had and left out the cashews and it was super tasty.

I had high hopes for this recipe - we love Indian food and this read as though it would have an authentic flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly as written - it was bland and boring.  No requests for seconds even.  I would not  make this again.

Halved this recipe as there only two of us and it still made a lot. The recipe is delicious and perfectly spiced.

The family loved it and this is  the second time making it. Spiced it up this time with Jalapenos added with the red pepper. Yum!

This was delicious! My husband travels to India frequently. He said this was good, even better than what he’s had there. It’s a keeper.

This was good. I would make it again, using more chicken, no peas, and would serve on rice. Needs a little more salt.
