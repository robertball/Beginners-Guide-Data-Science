Good sandwich, and a nice combo of sweet and spicy.  The amount of sausage you need will depend on how large your sausages are.  Mine were kind of small, so I used more.  I used higher heat for both the sausages and apples, so that speeded up the preparation.  I also used 15 grain bread that made a crunchy and substantial sandwich.  I decided to just put the maple syrup in a small container and dip my sandwich into it.  Don't try it, it doesn't work very well and the contents of the sandwich fall out.

I didn't use the sausage/apple mixture for a sandwich. I paired it with the Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes from this site. 

I browned half a package of maple sausage links with a whole Granny Smith
as to share with my two kids. Really, really good. And it went really well with the pancakes.

I'll for sure be making this often.

This is a great start - Now lets put the sausage and apples on top of French Toast. Then we can make it ahead of time and refrigerate it or put it 
into individual containers and freeze it for busy week day breakfasts! a really fine brunch dish!

Love this. The only thing I did different was to add cinnamon to the apples, use pre-cooked sausage links that just have to be heated up & double the whole recipe for 2 people. Maybe we eat a lot but that is not enough food for 2 people. It is also longer than 5 mins prep time, no one will have the apples  ready so they should be included in the prep time which brings it to about 10 mins. I made this on homemade bread from my breadmaker. My husband laughed at the odd combination the first time I made it but I have made it several times since & he loves it (I just didn't get around to reviewing it). Thanks a bunch. EDIT: I have made this every weekend since. I crave this sandwich all the time. I want to try it with egg sometime instead of apple. You must try this recipe!

Pretty good.  I made this as directed with sausage patties instead because thats what I had on hand.  I did add cinnamon and a little clove to the apples while they were cooking.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were and how filling also!  this was one breakfast my 3 year old son actually ate more than 2 bites.  High compliments there.

Very good and easy. I will make this again; the whole family enjoyed it. 1) I'd like to try it with cinn. raisin bread. 2)As another variation I'll try it with chicken & blueberry sausages that we get from time to time. Yum!

Made this for my kids.  One of my kids liked it and the others were meh.  Made the bread into French toast and added a sprinkling of cinnamon. Will try it again when I happen to have all the ingredients and see if my husband likes it.
