Fabulous!  I didn't have whole spices, so I used ground.  I only had time to chill it for a couple of hours, but it still tasted great!

I made two different cranberry sauces for Thanksgiving dinner this year - my usual Oranged Cranberry Sauce from this site, and this one.  I cut it back to 8 servings, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was a beautiful, flavorful sauce, just a tad sweeter than I like.  That could simply be the result of the fruit I used (pears can really vary in sweetness), and is easily fixed by adding a portion of the sugar, then adding more as needed after the fruit has had time to release its juices.  I'll definitely make this again!

"SUPERB" is right! Excellent flavor and texture combinations. Everyone raved about it! I did choose to add more cranberries than the 6 cups called for....it was just a bit sweet for my taste as I enjoy a more tart flavor to my cranberry sauce. Just a personal preference issue, not really a criticism.

This was the first time that I cooked homemade cranberry sauce, and I was very excited to see that this incorporated fruit other than just cranberries.  I left it in the fridge for approximately 24 hours, but it didn't gel up the way that I thought it would.  Also, it was delicious, but just way too sweet to eat as a side dish.  My husband said that it could probably be used as filling or a topping for a dessert, because it is very sweet.  Although the sweetness bothered us, the taste was very good; hence, I will be making it again.  Next time, I will cut back on the sugar and use more cranberries.

This cranberry sauce was amazing.  I made it without the allspice, to satisfy some of our holiday guests.  But the best part was that my dad and grandpa, who don't even like cranberry sauce, loved this.  It was a great mix of fruits and spices, AND very easy to make.

This is great for people who aren't really fond of cranberries - it has a lot of apple flavor.  It's pretty good, but I personally prefer cranberry relish.

I have made this cranberry compote the past three Thanksgivings...and it is ALWAYS a hit!   It is a great accompaniment to the turkey and stuffing.  For best results, make it a day ahead of time and refrigerate so that ingredients meld together...yum! (side note...who would ever just open a can of cranberry sauce and serve it??)

I made this last Thanksgiving and was hoping I could find the recipe again.  I have been craving it all year!  It was hands-down the best cranberry sauce I've ever had, and everyone else at the table (including a bunch of gourmet foodies), said the same.  This year, I will make an extra batch of this to can and give the jars to my guests to take home.

This is awesome! A sweet and sour crunch really goes good with a hot slice of turkey! Use this one every year.

This was excellent, but I made a few modifications.  I used ground spices (about 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp cloves.)  I also cut the sugar way back.  I used a total of 1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar blend and we all agreed that it tasted great.  It was also good warm, and I even thought it would make a great fruit base for a fruit crisp!

Was a really good cranberry sauce!  As my spices have been around for awhile, I used more than the recipe specified.  Also didn't have quite enough pear, but what I had is pretty nice in there.  If I'd add anything, would be a handful of pecans.  May well make again, should I have pears handy.

A new holiday favorite! I cut the white sugar amount by a cup and I still found it could have been reduced a little more.  Also added 1 tsp. ginger for a little bite.  Just AWESOME!!!

My husband hates cranberry sauce, but that did not slow him down eating half a bowl of this. I was short on orange juice so I supplemented with apple juice and Grand Marnier. Probably would do it that way again.

This cranberry sauce is amazing. It is now served at every Christmas dinner. I will remember to keep corn starch or gelatin on hand though, as this year the sauce didn't set. The flavor was still a hit but had to be served in separate bowls. I also halved the recipe since this makes an entire stock pot.
