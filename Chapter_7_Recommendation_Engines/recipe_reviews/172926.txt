This was ok. It would have been much better if the chicken was seasoned. I think marinating the chicken would have added more flavor to the recipe. The chicken was flavorless, the filling was good.  FYI - I did not add the gouda to the frying pan to melt it. I had very thinly sliced gouda that put directly on the chicken. I then put the cooked leeks on the gouda and rolled it. Then rolled it in the ham. The filling came out fine. It wasn't a messy, goopy mess this way.  I'd make it again, but marinate the chicken first, or somehow season it.

Took this recipe and used veal instead. When couldn't get our cured meat cut thinly enough so we wrapped the veal around meat, leaks and smoked gouda. Like others suggested we did not melt the gouda, it melted just fine in while the meat was cooking. Also before cooking sprinkled garlic powder, salt and pepper on outside of the meat to give more flavor.

Made this and it came out very good. It wasn't very difficult, is pretty healthy, and is kind of "fancy." The only thing I will do differently next time is to make double the "stuffing." Maybe my chicken pieces were larger? I felt it would have been better with more of the leek/gouda/garlic inside.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I flattened out the chicken breasts first to help with the stuffing and did not melt the cheese in the pan as directed.  I just laid a slice of cheese (Gouda) on the inside with the leek and garlic mixture after it had cooled a bit as well as added a layer of salt/pepper.  After the chicken was done (it did not take as long because I had thinned the breasts) and the chicken was resting, I grated a bit of extra cheese on the top and garnished with more of the cooked leaks.  We will have this again and again.

This recipe wasn't inedible by a long shot but it was very dull.  I'm not sure what adjustments could be made to the chicken--I covered mine front and back with black pepper for some umph due to other reviewer comments.  That wasn't enough, anyway.  Smoked gouda is also strong enough that I really lost any other flavors that might have been in the filling.  Neither did my gouda 'melt', exactly.  I think the pan wasn't hot enough since I was aiming not to burn the garlic.  Unfortunately, not something I'd do again.

This was great!  Fresh leeks from the garden.  I used a little fresh ground white pepper and salt for seasoning.  We all loved it.

I used garlic and sweet yellow onion Wisconsin smoked Gouda I sliced it very thin and did not pre-melt in the pan. I sort of reversed it I used cooked bacon and put it inside with the cheese I seasoned with salt pepper lemon juice and paprika then seared in my favorite skillet then into the oven. I deglazed my pan with vermouth and chicken stock then made an herbed smokey cheese sauce with the gouda and an Italian cheese blend. For fun I cooked lasana noodles cutting most of them into smaller squares then wrapped each breast into one.  My teens looked at me funny when I served it but they both ate it and had no complaints always a bonus

Nice recipe with a great presentation! I shredded the cheese and then wrapped the cheese and the cooked leeks with the prosciutto. I also ended up breading the chicken with panko. My family (4 hungry boys) all liked it!

Didn't have Gouda. Used Provolone. Still excellent.
