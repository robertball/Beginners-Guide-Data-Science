This recipe is the best!  I would recommend that you not use your 'best' high-shelf irish whiskey!  Save the Bushmill's 12-year-reserve for sipping!

Excellent! I also add a bit of Dark (Green) Creme de Menthe in the cream for a festive Irish green color as well as a bit of chocolate syrup after adding in the coffee for a mint-chocolate flavor in the coffee.
