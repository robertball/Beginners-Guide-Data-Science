I loved this idea and glad it was shared!

I used 6 cloves garlic (I love garlic) and 6 green onions  (all I had on hand). I didn't use any butter while sauting, merely a tablespoon of olive oil. Once the garlic and onions were translucent, I added 1 lb. lean ground beef, seasoned it with about 2 tsps. garlic powder, 2 tsps. onion powder, 1 tsp. season salt, and eyeballed some freshly ground black pepper. Once the meat was cooked thoroughly, I added 4 tsps. dried basil & 2 tsps. dried oregano (a tip to get the flavor of dried spices to heighten, rub the dried spices in your dry hands before placing in the recipe, it releases the oils in the herbs) as well as one-fourth tsp. crushed red pepper (for some heat). I reduced the heat and let this simmer for about 5 minutes.

Then I added 2-14.5 oz. cans of tomatoes, including the juices  (I LOVE tomatoes and chose 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes & 1 can petite diced tomatoes), as well as one-half can tomato paste (to add some body to the sauce as recommended by another reviewer). I let this simmer for about 10 minutes.

Next I used a fork to pull the squash away from the skin. I then added the squash to the sauce mixture and stirred well to incorporate the squash well with the sauce. I then let it simmer for about 10 minutes.

This yielded quite a bit and I froze half of it once it cooled, the other half was demolished immediately!

This was great! Even my husband liked it and he doesn't like squash!  I did spice it up by using diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of stewed tomatoes. I saut√©ed chopped celery with the onions and added half a pound of cooked hot spiced sausage. I baked my squash 30 minutes longer as it was a good sized squash. I will make this again!!

The tomato sauce needed some tweaking. I added a can of tomato paste for sweetness and body. I added 1/8 tsp. of chili flakes for some bite. I used shredded Parmesan, Romano and Asiago instead of grated Parmesan. I only needed half a spaghetti squash because I wanted the sauce to DOMINATE the dish (covered and refrigerated the rest for another day). Turned out very good--served with chicken Parmesan from this food site. A very satisfying meal without all the pasta!

I liked the recipe a lot. The flavor was great, I also added a bit more garlic and some oregano to give it an extra kick. It makes a lot of spaghetti which I was not prepared for but seems to keep for a couple days pretty well. The squash was a little crunchy for my taste so I definietly recommend cooking it the full 45 min and not 30 min like many other recipes say. I will definelty be making this again soon! Thinking about adding some turkey meatballs next time!

OMG, delicious!  I, too, added a bit more garlic and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Split the recipe to use vege chicken and regular chicken as well.  So easy and incredibly delicious!

I made this for the second time & had forgotten how good it is. Only change I made was increasing the Parmesan cheese to 1/2 c. I also sprinkled a little garlic salt on my individual serving and thought it was even more delicious. Would definitely recommend this recipe.

Just made it and it's a hit.  My boyfriend and I loved it.  I didn't have the diced tomatoes so added 1 diced fresh tomato.  1/2 can of tomato sauce. Still amazing.

Excellent! Followed recipe almost exactly except my diced tomatoes didn't have green pepper and celery, so I added 1 stalk diced celery when adding the garlic.  Did all else the same and added a few dashes of nutmeg near the end.  Served with a warm crusty ciabatta bun. Filling, flavourful and healthy! Who could ask for more :)

I've made this numerous times with much success and great results. I do cook my Squash differently, cutting it half clean out seeds etc. lay face down in glass baking dish. Add enough water to seal edges of squash. Cover with cellophane wrap making sure edges of baking dish are sealed. Microwave until outer shell of Squash can easily be penetrated with a fork. When done handle with oven mitt, scrap internals with fork.
Add to cooked recipe tomato ingredient's serve hot.

Made this recipe with huge onion, four garlic cloves and a 28 oz can of tomatoes. I also added a little cheddar cheese along with the parmesan. Delicious! My husband and 9 month old loved it.

This was my first time buying and making spaghetti squash.  Only change I made was omitting the butter and just using EVOO.  This recipe was quick, easy and turned out delicious.  Definitely one of my new favourite dishes.

I LOVE this recipe!  I did need to adjust the salt and pepper by half and that was plenty and I doubled the garlic.  I also eliminated the butter and only used avocado oil.  I also added in fresh green pepper, celery, fresh basil and a pinch of crushed red pepper.  Yummy!

Very good! When craving spaghetti this is a super tasty alternative. I doubled the garlic. This would be good with ground meat too.

This is for the cooking of the spaghetti squash only. Great idea to use water. I had previously cooked it in the Kamado Joe and while it was good, it needed the water!

After reading some of the other reviews - I used more garlic - olive oil and no butter.  I had some left over Costco chicken that I cut up to add protein.  I added a can of tomato paste and about a fourth cup of red wine vinegar, plus a shot of hot sauce.  It was delicious.  I am going to freeze the leftovers and we can have them when we get home from our trip.  Definitely will be fixing this again.

pretty good spaghetti squash! Will be cooking this frequently! Though my squash needed more than 45 min, and there wasn't enough water so it ended up getting a little burnt. I'll add more water next time.

This is fantastic! The only changes I made were that I didn't have only basil on hand so I substituted Italian seasoning. Because I like a kick I added a little crushed red pepper. I am a pasta freak, but I would have this any day over plain old spaghetti.

This was very good. I definitely used extra garlic including some on the squash which I added butter to as well. I added some leftover shredded rotisserie chicken to the sauce to make it a complete meal and it made a large portion.

I used a can of stewed Italian tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  I drained them though so it wasn't so juicy.  Was very good, will make again.
