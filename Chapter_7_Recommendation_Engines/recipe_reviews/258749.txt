This tart is so lovely and really makes the flavor of fresh strawberries stand out. I like the the cheese sauce is not too sweet. My tart turned out a little larger, but I still had plenty of sauce.

My family and I loved this. I used fresh strawberries that we picked a few days ago, which probably made it better. I did use a tart pan (not to be fancy!) and so I just rolled the dough out and placed it in there. Because I'm impatient I didn't let the dough sit in the refrigerator. The tart was like pie, but better. Because I used the tart pan my dough came very crunchy and that was a great and unexpected texture. So don't be afraid of going too big/thin with the crust!

I enjoyed making this strawberry tart. I made it as the recipe said except I used sour cream instead of creme fraise. The cream cheese filling was too salty, but I will try it again; maybe I made an error. 
 
Just a note; before you buy ingredients: any jam can be used (apricot was delicious), the lemon zest was lovely, but I think the dessert would be OK without it.
