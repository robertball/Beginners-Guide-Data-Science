I make a similar stuffing to this recipe....I use hot pork sausage, chopped walnuts, one golden delicious apple cubed, chopped celery and onion and two boxes cornbread stuffing mix. I always add one can of whole berry cranberries so that it is moist and adds a little sweetness.

Great recipe base for Thanksgiving.  I did make some changes to suit our preferences and what I had on hand.  Instead of stuffing mix, I used Farm to Market Grains Galore bread, which I cubed and toasted in the oven. I used walnuts, almonds, and pine nuts; no pistachios or macadamias.  I also doubled the amount of sausage and used fresh sage instead of dried sage.  We enjoyed it with our Thanksgiving dinner, but it was much, much better the following day.  I'll make it again next year, but I recommend making it a day ahead of time.

I made this recipe this afternoon!   It was divided into to large, square baking dishes and there was still some leftover to go inside the bird and some in an extra aluminum baking pan.  It turned out AMAZING!!!  This MIGHT be my favorite dressing!  I followed the directions and stopped with about one cup of chicken broth to spare.  It was a fun and easy recipe to put together.   Delicious!

Was great for our first Thanksgiving dinner together.  We kicked it up a notch with some fresh diced jalapenos.  Loved all the nuts!!!!

I made my own bread stuffing,  and omitted carrots, added shredded chicken and more seasoning. Then I threw it all in a squash, it was good. Was trying to find a recipes do to exactly  that, couldn't to I improvised.
