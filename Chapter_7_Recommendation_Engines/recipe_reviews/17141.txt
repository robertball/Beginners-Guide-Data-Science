Was making this for a shower so I read the reviews before I started and made the following adjustments...used slivered almonds, 1 granny smith apple (diced with skins), dried cranberries and used as much as 4 cups of chopped turkey.  The celery and parsley I used as the recipe stated.  I also used 2/3 dark meat and 1/3 white meat to help keep it moist.  Of course I needed to double the dressing mixture, it turned out PERFECT!  Served on small croisants...guests were begging for the recipe...very easy...will definitely make again!

A very tasty dish, brought raves from my office. Very easy to make ahead and bring to a potluck. I doubled the amount of mayo & sour cream; it seemed dry.

Easy and Fast.  I substituted slivered almonds for the walnuts, Italian flat leaf parsley for normal parsley and I doubled the amount of the sour cream and mayo.  I bet you could substitue plain yogurt for the mayo and it would be great.  I used a Jennie-o precooked oven roasted turkey breast and it had great flavor and it was fast.  I will definitely make this again and bring to potlucks at work!!!

I have been using a recipe very similar to this for years.  It is a very good salad.  I like to add halved red grapes to it when using red apples and green grapes when using granny smith apples. I often use chicken in place of the turkey. I love it in Pita or wraps.

I love this salad.  It was very tasty!  I had to substitute 1 tsp. of dried parsley, light sour cream and a tsp. of regular mustard and it was wonderful.  Thanks for a great thanksgiving leftover recipe!

This is excellent - great way to use up leftover turkey and eat walnuts, which are very good for you, but not my favorite thing in the world. I used a little more lemon juice, a little less mayo and light sour cream. Also added a little tobasco sauce. Will put in dried cranberries next time/

Delicious.  I added about 4 chopped scallions, 6 pureed seedless green grapes, 2 TBS dried cranberies, 2 TBS golden raisins and 1 TBS hot sauce, as someone recommended.  It's chilling in my refrigerator right now.  Thanks!

Perfect for leftover turkey! We loved its delightful crunchy texture. Only 1 celery, 1 apple, and 1 T. of lemon juice are needed...much more than that and you'll have a celery, apple, runny salad. Slice the celery thin and dice the apple. Instead of walnuts, I used sliced almonds sauteed in butter. Must be chilled for the flavors to come together.

Great recipe! My picky 10 yr old loved it. I only had pecans and golden delicious apples in the house to use and it still came out delicious.

Thought this was fine; but did add more turkey, a smidge more dijon mustard (a personal taste choice, I think) and a can of whole berry cranberry sauce to the mixture after mixing the meat and filling together, served it in store-bought croissants.  Also, tried this with a purchased rotisserie chicken, which we thought gave the salad more zip and served in a melon ring.

awesome recipe!!! I only used miracle whip 1/2 cup instead of mayo and sour cream because that was all I had.  I also used 1 tea dried mustard instead of dijon, also all I had.  I used 1 mac apple and a pinch more honey.  Great recipe for leftover turkey!!!  I wouldn't double the dressing,  it would me way too creamy for my taste!

I'm watching my cholesterol, so I substituted fat free sour cream and a healthy mayo and it was still SO good! Personally, I added more walnuts, but then I loved the crunch and am trying to eat more nuts!

This has got to be one of the best salads we've ever tasted!  We substituted chicken for the turkey and plan to fix it often.

I LOVE this recipe, and so does everyone I've served it to.  I make it about once a week!  Only, I leave out the sour cream (just too 'sour'!) and lately I've been putting in dried canberries for a splash of color and zing.  Yummy!!

This was a great recipe I  used smoked turkey leftovers and it turned out great. It would have been very saucy if I had only used one cup of turkey so I put in about 2 1/2 cups and it was fine.

I made this recipe with 3 changes, because I didn't have the exact ingredients. I used regular mustard instead of dijon, cilantro instead of parsley, and added about 1/2 cup of pomegranate arils. All I have to say is YUMMY!!! I had several people for lunch when I made this and everyone raved about how yummy it was. Definitely a keeper!

Very good way to use up that leftover turkey. I added a few Tablespoons of my cranberry/orage relish to it. Yum! Nice summer salad I would think.

Looked kind of odd after it was made, but it tastes good.  Next time I would use more turkey and less apples.

I found this to be missing something but don't know what! Maybe adding a bit more honey would be good! Will try again to see if I can come up with a bit of a change! Basic recipe OK but needs more!

Loved making this on a hot day.  Used cooked chicken breasts, fat free sour cream, low fat mayo and added some dried cranraisens and a bit of low salt soy sauce in the dressing.  Very yummy!  Gave four stars because I altered.

We find we prefer this without the mustard and with a bit of salt and pepper added. Also, I use less mayo and sour cream. Sometimes I add curry powder to it, enough for our tastes. A versatile recipe that you can make with your own tastes in mind. Good with grapes added or dried cranberries or dried cherries.

This was delicious!  Some changes I made to the recipe- I used diced chicken breast instead of turkey and fat free miracle whip and fat free sour cream instead of regular mayo and sour cream. I also used a little dried parsley instead of fresh because that's all I had.  I'll be making this one all summer long as a light meal!  One of the best recipes I have tried on this site.  Thanks for sharing!

This wasn't a bad recipe, but if I make it again, I will make some changes. I would do one apple instead of two and I would cube them very small. I would do more nuts and maybe a bit more turkey, too. The sauce tasted good. Actually, I improvised cause I didn't have a lemon, so I put a bit of lemonade in place of the lemon and honey. It worked.

Per earlier reviews, I halved the lemon juice and apple (used golden delicious), and added about 1/4 cup crushed pineapple and more turkey.  We like sweet and savory (as opposed to sour or tart) and it was perfect in a pita pocket.  I think the doubling of the sauce is strictly a personal preference.  We like only enough sauce to hold the other ingredients together, so I did not double and felt was juicier than I would prefer.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I added a handful of dried cranberries. I also used my food processor to cut down on chopping and because I like the consistency.  Delicious!

This recipe is sooo yummy!  I made one slight adjustment and replaced the walnuts with dried cranberries since my son has a tree nut allergy.  It is a fantastic use of leftover turkey.  Will make again and again!!

Its good for something quick.  Tart apples are key. Perhaps a little more honey and less mayo would be good.  Not bad for leftovers.

This was so delicous!  I used some leftover turkey breast and followed the recipe *almost* exactly.  I reduced the celery to 1 large stalk and reduced the apple to 1 large MacIntosh (peeled).  I also omitted the sour cream because I didn't have any and just used Olive Oil Hellmans.  The end result was absolutely delicous - to the point that my husband who proclaims to hate turkey salad rated it 5 stars.  The next time I make this, I will toast the walnuts for added flavour and I might add some dried cranberries which would be delicious as well.  EDIT: I made this again using chicken and it was just as good!

Yum Yum!!  We had leftover turkey, and I want to make something  "different", rather than the same ole things.  So, I just finished whipping it up.  I didn't let my son see me chopping the apples, he never would of tried it if he knew they were in there, and gave him a sample bite when it was finished.  I told him there was a secret ingredient in it... Anyway, he said "this is really good."  I then told him and hubby about the apple and walnuts and they both gave it two thumbs up.  This one is a keeper!

Great Recipe!  I just made this using leftover dark meat from my holiday turkey.  I followed the recipe as written except I didn't use celery since I didnt' have any leftover. Came out GREAT... the dressing is very good and I would use it on macaroni salad, etc., in the summer.  Thanks!

This was excellent!  I'm usually not this type of a salad person, but we were going to a football party the day after Thanksgiving and needed to bring something, & had all the ingredients, so I made this. I did add about 1/4 cup dried cranberries (tip from another recipe) and used this as a "dip" to put on crackers.  Wow!  I'm impressed!  People loved it!!!  So did I!  I can see putting this on bread like a sandwich too.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will make again!

I have made this 3 times now, first with turkey sliced thick from the deli counter, next with chicken and finally with leftover turkey - obviously it's great if I keep making it! Least favorite was with the deli turkey, other two were delicious!

Fabulous. I added raisins and more than doubled the turkey. As everyone else did, I doubled the sour cream and mayo. It was just perfect. Not to wet or dry. Also picked the dried cranberries out of a fruit/nut snack mix we had and threw them in. Only had cashews and pecans, so that's what I used. Toasted 1/2" slices of a french baguette and topped with this awesome salad for tasty post Christmas dinner lunch.

I have been remiss in not reviewing this sooner. I sent the hubs to work with this on a pita just after Thanksgiving....I used a whole pita, which was too much for him to eat, so he shared with "the guys".  The ones with plain ol' leftover turkey were jealous!  Super job nice healthy recipe, too

Four Stars because I did not follow the recipe.  I used leftover chicken, both white and dark meat. I did follow the dressing using others suggestions to make twice the amount and I found I did need it. I try to find low-sodium recipes. I did not add the salt and did not miss it. The recipe called for several leftovers (besides the chicken) I needed to find use for left in the frig such as the apple, celery, parsley. I even had some nuts in a bowl left from the holidays and cracked the walnuts which were so fresh and crunchy.  Two items I forgot to add were dried cranberries and I think a little hot sauce like Tobasco would have given it that extra tweek. The cranberries would not only add to the taste, but the presentation for color. Not only did the recipe taste yummy but we had the added bit of not wasting food. I had this recipe re-calculated to yield two servings. The original recipe yielded six servings and called for 1 cup cooked, cubed turkey meat. The re-calculated recipe called for one-third cup.  This seemed very skimpy to me and for the 2 servings I used one cup chicken, cubed.  We found this recipe to be very yummy and will go into my recipe box for 'a keeper'.  Thank-you Chris, I think this will get much use in warm weather as a luncheon dish.  QUESTION: Am I the only person that thinks when you alter a recipe to either add or scale-down on the amount it will serve that it also alters the taste of the original recipe?

This was delicious! I've had other versions of this recipe in cafes and restaurants, but this was the first time I've actually tried to make it. My fiance also loved this turkey salad. It's definitely "crunchy" and the dressing is spot on!

This recipe has so much potential!  I initially made it just as written, with the exception of not adding all of the dressing.  I felt it needed a little punch, so added dried cranberries.  Still needed a little something...So, added a smidge of apple cider vinegar and about a teaspoon of dried tarragon.  Still seemed to need something, but instead of overdoing, I put it in the fridge for my husband to taste and see if had any suggestions... Took it out after about 30 minutes and boy did those flavors pop!  Just remember to allow this to sit for a few minutes for the flavors to meld.  It's a real winner with or without my additions!!!

Save a bowl and mix the dressing in the big bowl first, then toss in the other stuff. A delicious salad, and great with chicken, too. I cut the solids up fairly fine, and serve with crackers or toasted baguette slices. Also I sometimes put in a couple of pinches of dry tarragon, gives it a slightly different taste.

This is one of my favorite recipes to fix using leftover turkey.  I must admit that I've altered the recipe to suit our tastes and it is still great.  I do not use the sour cream, honey, or chopped parsley.  I didn't have those ingredients the first time I ever made this so have left them out whenever I make it now.  I always season(salt and pepper)my recipes to our particular likes and not necessarily the amount the recipe calls for. This is a wonderful salad that I like to serve with a little lettece on large croissant rolls.  It is always a crowd pleaser.

I think this is the lowest rating I've given any recipe here. I'll try to salvage it for a topping on lettuce. First, it needs more spice and acid, the apples and celery need to be finely chopped, more mustard or something with flavor is needed. Not a keeper.

I didn't measure anything and was missing most of the ingrediants. Used some left over turkey meat, some green apples my kids wouldn't eat, some celery seed, chopped up peacans I found in the freezer, honey, homey mustard and Mayo Lite. Wicked Good!!

Very good recipe.  Make sure you salt and pepper to your taste.  My substitions were scaling down to 3 servings and using honey mustard, instead of the honey and dijon mustard mixed together.  I also put in a teaspoon of ground flaxseed.

Delicious salad with personalized changes.  Since I had only 1 Braeburn apple, I added an 8 oz. can of drainend, tidbit pineapple.  Had no Dijon mustard so I used a small amount of honey mustard.  Had to add extra honey (about 1/2 Tab.) to combat sharpness of lemon juice.  Then it was delicious! I used deli oven-roasted turkey breast and cubed it.  Next time that I make it, I will include these changes.

I only made one substitution and one change--I used pecans instead of walnuts and I omitted the additional salt. Very interesting sandwich-salad recipe. We all really enjoyed it, even my husband who can be a bit picky when it comes to these kind of sandwich fillings. It did have a little too much apple, when I make this again I would only use one small tart apple instead of two.

As written, I would give this recipe only 3 stars, because the ratios seem to be off. I started with the called-for amount of nuts, apples, and celery, but after I added the turkey, it looked like it was about to become an apple, celery, and nut salad with a sprinkle of turkey. So I decided to deviate even more. Good thing this recipe is very versatile. When all was said and done, my recipe was as follows: 2 1/2 cups turkey (dark and white), 2 stalks celery, one granny smith apple, 3/4 cup of dried cranberries, 1/2 cup sliced almonds (don't like walnuts as much), 1/2 cup each of plain yogurt and lite mayo (didn't have sour cream or regular mayo), 1/2 T dried parsley, a little over 1 T each of honey, dijon mustard, and lemon juice, and salt & pepper by eyeballing. It turned out very yummy, with the nice delicate crunch of the sliced almonds. Done my way, I give it 4 stars. Not 5 just because it wasn't AMAZING or out of the ordinary, but very good. The overall combination of flavors and textures is appealing to my tastes, so I appreciate the recipe to use as a guideline.

Scrumptious!  Modifications I made based on what was in the house:  wasabi mayonnaise for plain mayo, agave nectar for honey (decreased to 2 tsp), 1 T curry powder for mustard, omitted lemon juice, otherwise as-is.  Served on whole wheat tortilla as a wrap.  Glad there's enough for several servings!

Husband loved this sandwich. Only modification I made was to use cutting celery rather than celery.

This was a GREAT recipe for my leftover thanksgiving turkey!  For the most part I stuck to the recipe, but I did change the quantities.  I added more turkey & walnuts and less apple & celery.  It definitly needed more turkey than 1 cup.  My own twist was to add about 1/4 cup dried cranberries and that gave it a nice zing.  I liked this sandwich a lot, but it could be served as a salad a well.

Why do people feel the need to change  or add something every single recipe posted? Then it's not the recipe anymore.

I'm rating this as it is, and it's great.

I made a few changes suggested by other reviewers.. added dried cranberries and slivered almonds. It was good but not great. I would use this recipe again.

I just made this today.  It was very good.  I used light mayo and light sour cream.  I had to add more mayo to make it creamy.  It does not make for a good sandwich.  Better on a bed of lettuce.

The rating chart says 5 stars = "the Best!", can I give it a 10!?!?  I have forwarded this recipe to many friends.  This is delightful!  I use leftover rotisserie chicken and it is gone in no time!  Worth the time to make it!

Delish! Added extra walnuts and a handful of craisins for color (besides cranberry goes great with turkey) . Used 2tsp dried parsley in place of fresh. Fresh lemon juice makes such a difference too. Yum. 2 pink lady apples chopped. Will double amount of turkey next time.

This a sweet, tasty salad.  You can make substitutions easily.  I've made this with apples and also with cranberries.  As much as I love cranberries, I thought the apples made for a better balance of flavor, cranberries really ramp up the sweetness.  I used half of the lemon and substituted honey flavored Greek yogurt for the sour cream and the honey. I've tried both walnuts and almonds and unless you are a huge walnut fan, the almonds are better.  I also tried doubling the dressing but it was way too creamy for my taste. I added more turkey to remedy that.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This is very tasty. For me the ratio of apple to turkey was a little high so I added some more turkey but still, it was very good.

This recipe is awesome. Also, very versatile. I left out the celery,b/c my husband doesn't like it. That did not affect the taste at all. You can make this salad w/ any fruit(grapes,craisins etc.) and any nut(almonds,pecans...) but do not leave out or sub the fresh lemon juice or HONEY!! It makes the dressing!!

This recipe was good except for the sauce.However I did find a sauce off a chicken salad recipe on here that was even easier and required less ingredients that went fabulous. I even made a second batch! So thank you for the base recipe.

YUM! What a great way to get rid of all this turkey after Thanksgiving! I love the tangy tartness of the dressing with the slightly sweetness of the honey. A match made in heaven! Hubby doesn't like most nuts so I put in pine nuts and it tasted superb.Thanks for a great recipe!

This is good, but I did make some modifications to the recipe. I substituted honey mustard for the Dijon Mustard and omitted the 1tbsp of honey. I used a cup of mayo/salad dressing and omitted the lemon juice and sour cream. I added red grapes (halved w/ seeds removed) and finely finely chopped my celery. I also added onion powder and finely chopped onions and 1 tbsp of sugar. This was a sure fire hit w/ our friends and I even ended up going over to a friends house to help her make hers. This is good snack food and the kids will love it.

This makes a wonderful lite lunch.
Instead of 2 apples, I substituted 1 cup of craisins for 1 apple.

Very good recipe for leftover turkey.  I substituted almonds for the walnuts because that's what I had on hand.  My family loved this salad.  I've had a chicken salad from a cafe that was very similar to this but it had currants in it also.  And it was delicious.  Next time, I'll try adding currants to this recipe.

Just made this for a quick dinner.  I only had braeburn apples so that is what I used.  Also used oven toasted almonds instead of walnuts.  I only used about 1/2 cup of lite mayo and substituted lime juice for lemon--hubby loved it.
