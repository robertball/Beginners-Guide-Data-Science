First of all I double this recipe as I eat a few at a time.  2nd of all I have really played around with this recipe and I just took a batch out of the oven! This so far is my favorite.  Now just understand I work out a lot and try to eat as nutritionally healthy as I can. This is my tweaked recipe; I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, I use lt. brown sugar instead of white sugar, I use 3 tbl. butter instead of a 1/2 cup and replace the rest with applesauce.  I add maybe a little more applesauce because I like the moistness it offers, and lastly I don't use currants I use frozen blueberries cuz I love em!They make the scones a litte funny in color but I don't mind.  I have used rice flour ick, soy flour and white together, was ok, but these wheat ones are the best!  I also shoot a shot of honey in just because I like it.  I have used craisins, dried nectarines, all sorts of dried fruit but I still like the frozen blueberries the best. I am sure these scones are great as is, I just try to change recipes around for my liking sometimes.  This one was fun and I thank Carol for first submitting it!  Jodie

These are the best scones I have ever eaten. Period. I made a few modifications. I added one julienned Granny Smith apple (skin-on), 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp ground cloves. Before putting them in the oven I also sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and coarse sugar. YUMMMMMM!!! I had to try one when they first came out because they smelled so good, and then I couldn't resist eating another one right away! I took the rest into work *the next day* (how many scones are still great the next day??) and everybody loved them as much as I did. A++++ recipe, thanks!

I added a 1/2 teaspoon of maple flavoring extract, and used walnuts instead of currants.  I also used the "Sugar cookie glaze" recipe from this site (with maple flavoring), and the resulting scone was just like my husband's favorite cookie from Starbuck's.  Since we live in China, we don't get by there too often :)

My family loved these! I added dried cranberries instead of currants and a tablespoon of orange zest. I also put an orange glaze on top. They were terrific!

This has got to be the easiest scone ever to make!! No need to roll out the dough and fiddle with the cutters and all. It's absolutely delicious, from the 2nd try on, you can almost make it with your eyes closed!

Yummy!  I too used fat free milk and reduced fat margarine, and dried cranberries instead of currants.   These scones have a nice oat taste to them, and are very easy to make.  A+!

ACK! Dry, heavy, tasteless. Try less oats, more flour? I made a batch, choked down one for breakfast, and threw out the rest!

Subbed maple syrup for some of the milk and they turned out okay. A bit dry, though - not sure what they were lacking. Then again, perhaps I was too drunk to appreciate them fully.

I used single cream instead of milk, and raisins instead of currants.  My family loved them with jam, but they are a bit dry the next day.

At first I wasn't going to give this a star rating because I made quite a few changes,(whole wheat flour for AP, brown sugar for white, raisins for currants and applesauce for butter, with the addition of a half teaspoon of cinnamon), but then I realized that if I could make that many changes and they could still come out good, it must be a REALLY great recipe. They were just lightly sweet, and had a good, substantial texture from the oats. And my mom loved them, which is always a good sign! Excellent and versatile recipe.

YUMMY! I substituted 2/3 of the flour for whole wheat, used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and dried cherries ( I had to halve the recipe because there aren't very many people around:) I also added some vanilla and sprinkled the tops with brown sugar which was AMAZING! The brown sugar melts into caramel in a few places because the oven temp. is so high.

Fast, easy, delicious...my kids ate them and hubby even approves!  I think it needs that extra little bit of "something" to jazz it up a bit...will experiment further.

these were just great!  i used oat flour (just throw some rolled oats in the blender) in place of the all purpose flour.  i also used just 2 tablespoons of butter and the rest was applesauce.  i also only added 2 tablespoons of sugar (yellow sugar) instead of 1/4 cup.  i added some cinnamon and left out the currents because i didn't have any.  my 2 year old and i enjoyed them for breakfast with some all natural peanut butter, some raspberry jam (the jam provides a lot of sweetness) and a mug of tea .  thanks!!!

delicious. my first scones and they came out perfect. i only made 8 instead of 16. maybe because i kept the circle thicker. i brushed the tops with whipping cream and sugar and put a vanilla glaze on top. (1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and 1/4 cup water)

Good.  As other reviewers have stated, these aren't dessert sweet, but have a nice subtle sweetness.  I did add a small squeeze of honey since several reviews commented on dryness.  
Mine are delicious with or without butter - Tea or Coffee is a must!

WOW. This recipe is so amazing and easy. I'm not really a baking person but this was so easy. As others mentioned,I wanted it to be moist and chewy so I used 2 cups of flour instead of 1.5 and 1.5 cups of oats. I added little more milk and a tablespoon of maple syrup. It was so moist and delicious.

I love this recipe!  My family had eaten it 5 days a week, for six weeks without getting tired of it! I did use these substitutes at times: wheat flour, choc. chips, criasins, raisins, butter flavored shortening (sub. for butter), and banana (sub. for eggs).  I always doubled the recipe. This will always be a favorite, thank you so much for this recipe!

Awesome - I eat one for breakfast almost daily. They dry out very quickly so I now freeze them. While my coffee is brewing I pop one into the microwave for 30 seconds. I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour. Great with jam on top. I chose not to add any currants or raisins as I do not like either - although I think I'll add blueberries the next time. Wonderful!

Tender-crispy edges, and very tasty.  I omitted the currants, topped them with warm blackberry topping and whipped cream...positivley decadent!  O.K., then I ate a plain one with just butter...

I tried it twice once according to the recipe, and once changed up a bit. Both were good. The original recipe is just a tad bit dry and slightly heavy. I like them that way. So if you don't like that I'd look for a different recipe. I tried it with whole wheat and they where dryer so I should have compensated for that, my falt. However they where what I was looking for not too sweet not too cake like. Heavy, slightly sweet. Yummy. The way I'd expect a scone to be.

These were SO good!  I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup, used snipped raisins instead of currants, and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I also used heavy whipping cream instead of milk, and they turned out AMAZING!  I didn't have any problems with them being too dry, and the flavor and texture turned out soooo good.  Before baking, I also brushed the tops with cream and sprinkled on a little sugar.  I'll definitely be making these again.

I love scones and thought these were wonderful.  They're not too sweet so you can almost convince yourself you're eating something that's healthy!  They're nice and crispy on the outside but the texture is quite light.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, about 1/4 cup chopped crystallized ginger, the zest from one orange, and 3/4 cup dried cranberries.  Definitely a "keeper".

Delicious.  I cut some of the fat by using low fat margarine and skim milk.  Didn't make
a bit of difference.  They are still delicious.  Great with dried cranberries.  I'll make them
a little bigger next time.

So yummy! I kept sneaking just one more... The only changes I made were to decrease the oats to 1 1/2 cups, replaced the currants with dried cranberries and added 1 Tbsp of orange zest and 1/2 - 1 tsp of cinnamon. These were just right, not at all dry!

Yummy!  Loved the texture of the oats.  I thought the dryness/crumbliness was not a problem - about on par with other scones.  I subbed 1/2 the flour for wheat and added 2tbsp orange extract, 2tbsp cinammon, and subbed raisins for currants.  Additions are needed if you want something sweet. UPDATE: first time, I made individual scones and time was perfect. second time, I made 2 larger rounds to cut into wedges, and the middles took about 5 minutes extra to cook.

Having prepared the recipe as is, I found these were very similar to the scones my British friend used to make for me - even though hers were not made from oats! She used raisins, but I used dried cranberries because they were what I had on hand. I thought these were delicious - thank you for sharing the recipe.

I really enjoyed these!  The women I served them to appreciated the healthy twist to regular scones.  Of course, I did add mini chocolate chips!  Make sure not to bake too long as they can be a little dry.

These are great, hearty scones.  I agree that they are a bit dry, but a cup of tea takes care of that.  I made them with half all-purpose flour and half whole-wheat flour, turbinado sugar, half butter and half apple sauce, and raisins.  I also topped them with the maple butter frosting from this site and they were a nice addition to my rainy morning.

These were wonderful! I used whole wheat flour and cut the butter down and replaced with applesauce.  I froze them on cookie sheets to pop in the oven whenever we have the urge for wonderful scones without wanting to go through the hassle of making them.  I added cranberries in one, raisins walnuts and cinnamon in another, and bananas and walnuts in a third.  Yummy!!

Like a few other reviewers I had only golden raisins and dried cranberries so I used both. Nice blend of flavors including the oats. A bit dry the next day, but so many other breads and scones are too. These are best just out of the oven. Thanks, Carol.

I omitted the salt and replaced the currants with raisins. I also added some cinamon and I thought that they were great! They were a little bit cookie-like and not as dense as a typical scone, but they were still very enjoyable and I will definitely make them again. So quick and easy!

Not wonderful. I wouldn't recommend this recipe. I don't like to give a negative review, but in all fairness to those who read reviews to judge whether or not to try a new recipe, I would advise you to move on to another of the wonderful scone recipes on this site. Very disappointed in this one and I'm a very experienced cook.

These scones are hearty, wholesome and full of oatey goodness. I added craisins instead of currants and substituted some of the sugar with maple syrup. I think the maple syrup gave them a richer flavor, which I loved. I will definitely be making these again, especially considering they don't require buttermilk or loads of butter like other scone recipes.

These are really easy to make and taste delicious!! Just make sure to not put 4 teaspoons of baking soda instead of baking powder and dont put 4 tablespoons of either! Another tip: try them with chocolate chips instead of currants. Deliciouso!! (:

I've made these several times since finding this recipe and will continue to make them.  They're great.  I've made several variations - half whole wheat flour/half white flour, raisins in place of the currants, dried cranberries in place of the currants, and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  It's a great, easy recipe.  Thanks so much for some variety in my breakfast repertoire!

This is such a versatile recipe. My favorite way to make them is to use brown sugar for the white, substitute 1/4 cup of toasted, crushed pecans for the currants, and add a teaspoon of cinnamon. Although they are just great the way they are, I love pecans and cinnamon. I've also found they only need 12-13 min. baking time.

Yum! I just whipped these out on a whim. They have an awesome oaty texture and a little (but not overpowering) sweetness. They are super easy and quick to make as well. I made them with a half cup of mixed dried fruit that I had left 
over from making Cranberry Pignoli Nut Bread. Rather than rolling the scones out, I made 24 dough balls. They turned out great after baking for 13 minutes. Definitely a 5 star recipe!

Healthy stuff here.  To make them even healthier use 1/4 C of wheat flour and 1/4 C of wheat germ in place of a 1/2 cup of the white flour.  I used chocolate chips instead of the currants.  Then I fed the scones to my quilters.  They loved them.  Oh yes, don't forget to add a couple teaspoons of cinnamon.  Yum, Yum!

Loved this recipe!  I substituted currants with fresh marionberries.  Very moist.  The oatmeal holds the juice from the berries.   I will make these over and over and use fresh fruit always.  I have some fresh blueberries for the next batch.  :-)

These are incredible! I've made them several times, and every time they come out delicious. The outside is crisp and the inside is soft and flaky. And they're so quick and easy! I live on my won so I'll often make a batch of these on Sunday morning and freeze the individual pieces for breakfast during the week

I love these scones!  They are not sweet like some, perfect for breakfast.  I made mine with raisins because I can't find currents anywhere, and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon because I like it.  I'll definitely make these again!

mmm a delicious treat!  Great for snacks, desert, or breakfast!  I made some today and they turned out wonderfully! They are a cross of a small cake and a cookie. Instead of currants and oats, I used chocolate chips.  I also sprinkled them with sugar right when they came out of the oven.  I found they only needed to cook for about 7 to 8 minutes though.  Overall, a great recipe.

These are delicious and very easy to make!  I followed the recipe very closely except for adding an additional 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries.  The fresh fruit was a great addition.  I also separated the individual slices before baking.  They were gone very quickly.

I found these to be a bit bland, but they would probably liven up if you added some brown sugar. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon of cloves. If you added some more sugar, and some orange or lemon zest in addition to the spices, these would be great. They were also very easy to make.

BLAH!!!!  I did use cranraisins like others suggested instead.  I have cranberry recipes that are much better for scones.My husband said to give it a 2, but I'd given it a 1.

I loved this recipe.  Easy to make and they came out great.  Only changes I made were to leave out the salt (I used salted butter) and I used craisins instead of currants.  Will make again.  Thanks!

I loooove this recipe! I've made a couple of additions - I took out the currants and instead added an apple and a banana. This made the dough much more liquid so I just spooned them onto the baking sheet very generously and they turned out beautifully! Thanks for the amazing (and easy to customize!) recipe!!

Very good and filling for out of town company.  I substituted 1/2 wheat flour then 1/2 white flour.  Used dried cherries.  Thanks for the recipe, this is a keeper, mostly because it's so simple!

Great recipe! No currants... decided to experiment with 4 different add-ins: cinnamon, cinnamon-honey, cranberry, dark chocolate chip. The only one people were slow to eat was cinnamon (too plain??). They were great the day after I made them. --Slight modifications: used half whole wheat flour and evaporated milk because I had it on hand. Will make again!! The oats are great! **If you mix in honey, they will spread more when baking.

My mother made something like this as a special treat for breakfast. We'd take out all the jams and spreads out of the fridge and had a buffet of possibilities.  I think next time I will cut back on the baking soda, I thought 4tsp was too much, and I did taste it

Great recipe! The scones taste as buttery and crumbly as the ones that are basically made of butter. I halved the recipe and used a 2:1 ratio of Whole Wheat Pastry Flour to All Purpose Flour, and I used Fat Free Milk. I did use all real butter though, and sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top of them before baking. They turned out delicious, reheat well, and are perfect with a thin layer of jam on top. :)

I always make this recipe completely with applesauce (no butter at all), brown sugar, dried blueberries, lemon zest, and dried cranberries. They're delicious and pretty healthy, too - 100 calories each (unless I add dark chocolate) and almost no fat. I also took one user's suggestion of soaking the oats in milk and the scones are always moist. They aren't the best scones I've ever had, but the recipe gets 5 stars anyway for being so easy to change. I like eating these by themselves for breakfast.

i followed the recipe exactly (with a few healthier subs) and my scones were delicous. i did use apricots rather than currants and a white/wheat flour mixture. i used evaporated cane juice for sugar and earth balance as the butter. 

i wish they were a little fluffier, but for a oat scone these rock!

We love these and I have been making them about once a week.  I use half apple sauce in place of half of the butter.  I also use brown sugar instead of white.  To soften the oats a little bit and keep things from being too dry I soak the oats in the milk for a few minutes before mixing everything else in.  Overall a great recipe and very easy to change to your taste.

These are awesome. I make them at least once a week and my wife eats them for breakfast. To make it healthier, I replace all the butter with applesauce and use only whole wheat flour - they are still great this way! I also add chocolate chips=)

Not bad. I like the fact that they are  healthier than traditional scones because of the oats but mine were a little off. They did not need the full 15 minutes as called for, my mistake, and will try again with "quick oats" as oppossed to regular oats.  I think next time I will add some cinnamon or something for a little extra flavor.

I thought these were really great.  Came out perfect at 12 minutes.  Only differences in the recipe was a little extra sugar/with cinnamon, about 1/2C milk (dried cranberries instead of currants) and they weren't really crumbly at all, and with a little butter on top I would say an excellent healthier version of a scone.  Also I used quick oats and there were no texture problems at all.  Will absolutely make these again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made these scones a million different times, each time changing them a little bit (blueberries, raisins, cinnamon and pumpkin spice, etc.) and they always turn out great.  They taste just as good the second day because they dry out a bit and taste more "scone" like.

Even with the complete substitution of whole wheat flour (I left out 1/4 cup), these tasted great and not at all "wheaty".  I used chopped dates instead.  Next time I will try blueberries, Splenda and applesauce.  Great for breakfast, and very filling/satisfying.  I do think these could be a little less sweet though, considering they are scones, but I don't like having sugar for breakfast, so maybe that's why.  Bake it on parchment paper, and grease only the sides of the pan.  You'll get a nice crunchy crust and no burnt bottom (you'll like this tip if you have an oven that is tricky to deal with,like mine).

These scones tasted pretty great.  I did add cinnamon and vanilla extract after reading the reviews.  Even after cutting in the butter, the scones were NOT flakey, so next time I make them I won't bother doing that and I will melt it as the recipe states.  All in all, I enjoyed eating the scone and I put the rest in the freezer.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because it tasted good, but it didn't taste like scones.  It didn't have that flakey sconey texture, probably because the butter is melted instead of being cut in.  Tasty breakfast item - yes.  Scone - no.

What a great recipe!  I just devoured a few (too many :0) after they came right out of the oven.  Mmmm...  I did change a few things after reading some of the reviews and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon, substituted organic white wheat flour for all of the regular flour, and used quick cooking oats.  I also found that cooking them on a baking stone worked well and was careful not to overbake them.  
The result is wonderful!  I am thinking of making them for my coworkers and think that I will use applesause in place of some of the butter to make them a little healthier and I may try using chocolate chips instead of currants.  Can't wait to make these again!  :0)

My daughter and I made these, using the orange juice and craisins adaptations.  We also cut the butter in half and substituted cinnamon applesauce for the other half of the butter.  Still turned out moist and yummy!

So simple! I added a few things. 3/4 C wheat flour with 3/4 C unbleached flour. 1 1/2 C Oat Bran with 1/3C quick oats. Brown sugar in place of white, 1/2C orange juice with 1/3C milk. I found some craisens with orange essance, added those along with 3T melted butter, 1tsp almond extract and 1/4 C sliced almonds. Also, I dropped them on a silpat liner instead of a shaped cake so that they appear even more rustic. FABULOUS! This recipe is very versatile, can be endlessly changed to suit anyone's taste!  Thanks for the recipe!

I love these!  I like to omit the sugar altogether and use mashed banana in place of the butter and orange juice instead of milk to make them even better for you.

Delicous scone recipe! I varied the recipe by using chopped dates for the currants and I made twelve rounded mounds of dough for round scones. They only need about 12 minutes of baking time if formed this way. These didn't even need butter on them - although a little honey on a warm split scone put them over the top! Thanks Carol!

I took the advice of another reviewer and tried the maple extract, walnuts and maple-flavored sugar cookie glaze. AWESOME!  I highly recommend the variation!!

Made this for breakfast for my four children and myself.  I substituted whole spelt four for white, honey for sugar, and dried cranberries for currants.  I placed the rounds on parchment on a baking stone in the oven.  It was a hit.

Word to the wise - when adding the butter to the egg/milk mixture, be sure to let it cool a bit. You don't want the egg to start cookin!

These were really easy to make and tasted great. I used dried cranberries instead of currants. 

They were buttery and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. You couldn't really taste the oats. Definitely a keeper!

Substituted oat flour for the white flour, reduced the sugar (used homemade brown instead), coconut oil for the butter and blueberries for the currants. Doubled the recipe and it came out great. My daughter's picky picky BFF was over and ate 2. That speaks volumes, believe me. Will make these again!

Just before making this I was looking at another recipe that used dates in it.  So i added about 1/2 cut chopped dates into these and they were sweet and perfect.  they were a little dry... but perhaps thats part of scones.  Still perfect with tea :)

I love these!  The first time I made them I added a teaspoon of orange peel and some chopped craisins - amazing!  This morning I used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 cup canola oil and patted some raw, unrefined coarse sugar on top before baking with excellent results.

This is a perfect scone recipe. It's easy and delicious. I used dried cranberries but other than this substitution, I followed the recipe exactly. The wet ingredients mix in very well with the dry ingredients; just don't use heaping or densely packed cupfuls of flour and oats. Also, slice a few pats of butter and let sit to room temperature, put out a couple of jars of jams and jellies, some fresh berries, and you have a small afternoon tea.

These were yummy and super easy! I used dried cranberries instead of currants and I used orange sugar in place of regular sugar. These are great as is, but also did half with an orange glaze for those who like their scones sweet. Really, so easy and so fast!

Very good. Made exactly as written using craisins instead of currants. Also on the advice of a friend I cut the scones into individual pieces and pulled them apart slightly before baking. My husband said he could taste the salt but I didn't. You can add anything to these scones to customize. Thank you.

These turned out really good!  I did see where a few reviwers said they were dry and they are a tiny bit, but it doesn't stop them from being great!  I didn't use 2 cups of oats (only 1 1/2 cup).  Will be making this more often!

Had no problem with dryness, maybe because after reading the reviews I added a little extra milk.  However they were a bit heavy.  Not really what I was expecting.

I do not care for currants, or dried fruit for that matter, in baked good. I used chopped almonds, and also added 2 TB cinnamon. While I thought these were pretty good, they were a bit too dry for my taste. If I were going to eat these with butter or jam, they'd be fine, but on their own they were a little too dry. Good flavor, however. Next time, I think I will use less oats.

These are absolutely fabulous. I made the recipe to a 'T', except for making individual scones rather than forming 2 large circles and scoring into wedges. I then baked 10 mins at the same temp. I loved the texture and also how they aren't too sweet. I don't think they need a thing - jam, butter, etc. The butter flavour actually really comes through. Wonderful! Don't change a thing! - Update: Because I didn't have enough butter today, I made these with 1/4 butter 3/4 olive oil. Still perfect and delicious!!!

Great recipe - I just used craisins and added about 1/4 c more for more flavor, snipping them in half to keep them current-sized.  Easy trick: use 2 sticks of frozen butter and grate half of each into the dry ingredients before adding the wet stuff (the other half will melt in your hand).  It cuts down on the amount of stuff you need to mix, thus less gluten.

This was my first attempt at making scones.  Wow!  They were easy and turned out great, even though my baking powder was three years out of date and my husband is very discriminating when it comes to scones.  The only change we made was using cranberries instead of currants.  We will definitely make these often.

This was okay. It needs more liquid.... maybe more milk? it was very dry and crumbly, will probably try again, with a little more liquid next time. Easy to make with a 3 yr old to "help".

These were wonderful right out of the oven and warm, however I did not like them as well the next day. I will make them again for sure. The only thing I changed was I did not have dried currants so added dried chopped cherries instead. Yummy, thank you for the recipe

Not bad at all. Quite good with butter and jam. I followed the suggestions to soak the oats in a bit of milk and add cinnamon and nutmeg.

I used a spoon to brush the tops of the 2nd batch with honey and let them sit overnight. This was very good the next morning with hot tea.

These were absolutely delicious.  The only reason they get a four is because of the modifications that I had to make.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and sugar on the top.  they came out perfectly.  I will definitely make them again.

I made these with dried apricots & used vanilla Silk lite instead of milk and they are really good. They could be dressed up a little with a glaze of some sort if you wanted something sweeter, but they are great as is as well. Will definitely make these again.

Honestly, I didn't care much for the flavor of these.  They seemed rather bland - I thought I might have done something wrong, but I made everything as the recipe said to.  Not horrible but I won't be making these again.

I substituted orange juice for the milk in this recipe, and "Craisins" for the currants.  Although the OJ flavor was a little too subtle, overall the scones were moist and delicious.  Everyone really enjoyed them, including my MIL who is a wonderful cook and has a-um-particular palate. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good scones...I combined others' recommendations and added a squeeze of honey, 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of cinnamon and sprinkled a little brown sugar on top.  When I halved the dough for the circles, I put chocolate chips in one and dried cranberries in the other.  My husband liked them!

I agree with the other reviewers that these are pretty dry.  The dryness isn't bad, but the scones lack the flakey tenderness that I was looking for.  As I was eating them, I kept imagining how good they'd be with some garlic, dill, and maybe parmesan.  A technical note: I did have to add about 1/4 c more milk just to mix the batter (I know scone batter is supposed to be sticky), and I cut in, rather than melted the butter.

Like these.  My 6 year old son wouldn't eat them, because he saysthey are made with DRY oatmeal.  Mine came out pretty dry, by I am still hopeful for the recipe.  I think maybe adding in applesauce for half the butter and cooking a few minutes less might help moisten them.  Just a guess!  I also added in a little cinnamon.

these scones weren't too sweet, which was ok, but i would've liked them sweeter. I used 1/2 cup craisins and 2 tsp. orange peel, and were pretty good. I'll probably make them again.

Ooh SugarBabies! These are gooood BUT to gild the lily, mix up a glaze of powdered sugar, either milk or water and a bit of maple flavoring. Criss-cross the scones with this bit of icing after the scones have cooled. YUMMY!

Very tasty; I followed another reviewer's advice and patted oats onto the bottoms of the scones before baking.  I also substituted dried cranberries for the currants, and I then added about 1 tsp of grated orange rind.  I would recommend cutting the 2 patties into only 4 slices each rather than 8.

These scones are perfect served as a side dish or alone with a cuppa your favorite hot tea! I used dates instead of currants in one batch and in the next batch substituted 1/2 cup of the flour with whole-wheat flour and raisins for the currants. I also spiced 'em up a bit with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, etc. They're a little crumbly, but oh so delicious! Everyone loved them...from my husband to my toddler! Great family food!

These were fantastic! Really oaty- tasting, not too sweet, and easy to make. I pressed some oats on the tops to make them look pretty. I may try raisins next time. Amazingly, they were even good after 2 days (in air-tight storage), especially warmed up in the microwave with butter and honey. My kids loved them, too, which is surprising, considering they aren't that sweet. One of the kids has an aversion to currants, tho, and picked them all out.

My husband and I really enjoyed these scones!  I followed other reviewers' advice and added some cinnamon and nutmeg and a little extra sugar (maybe 1/8 cup more).  I also sprinkled some oats on my board before I pressed out the dough to form the scones and also pressed some into the top.  Yum!

I love these scones, particularly with the following modifications: I use 3/4 cup whole wheat flour & 3/4 cup unbleached flour, raisins instead of currants (usually what I have on hand), and add 1/2 tsp. (or more if you like!) of cinnamon. Super easy recipe.  Yumm!

Great flavor.  I really liked them, but they were a little crumbly.  I guess you can't expect otherwise with oats.  I used dried cranberries and some of the spices others suggested.  I may make some other changes next time.

Very good made with sweetened dried cranberries instead of currants.  Maybe try a bit more flour and a bit less oats to make them a little less crumbly.

Delicious! The oats give this scone a wonderful flavor. I took other reviewer's advice and shaped the dough into balls rather than wedges. I was so happy with how they came  out that I immediately made a second batch!

I thought these were great.  It is a good, simple, basic recipe that can be altered in so many delicious ways!  Thanks!  I used Craisins instead of currants. Delicious!

Excellent scone recipe.  I added chopped fruit bits instead of just currants and shaped them into individual round shapes and at first a I was a bit worried because the dough was very sticky but they turned out fine afterall.  My office mates seem to enjoy them.  Thank you!

Oh my, sooo good!  And so easy to make!  Because my family doesn't care for currants I used mini chocolate chips instead.  I used half and half instead of milk, just because I had some on hand.  These are so good for breakfast with a cup of coffee or as a snack with tea.  Very good even the next day - if any are left!  Thanks, Carol!

There are some very important steps missing from this  recipe to be giving it 5 stars.
Were they edible? Yes. The best? No.

First tip: You must use buttermilk when using baking powder, or you'll get that familiar fizzy baking powder taste that overwhelms the baked good.  The acidity in the buttermilk interacts with the baking powder and gets rid of that taste and also helps them rise a bit. 

Second tip: cut in your butter while it's COLD. Melted butter makes for flat baked goods. Cold butter makes a delicious flaky, crispy scone that isn't flat. 

Third tip: Don't over mix your dough. You'll end up with flat dense bricks. 

I followed this recipe to a T and they turned out flat and tasting of baking powder. We ate them with our coffee to cover the taste. I'll be doing another batch tomorrow with my tweaks.

I've made these oat scones many times per the recipe as well as exploring numerous adaptations.  My latest version came out with amazing flavors.  Substitute buttermilk for the milk, add 1/2 cup fresh blueberries, 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots, 1/2 cup toasted roughly-chopped almonds.  Add a sprinkle of large grain turbinado sugar to top of dough prior to baking.

I thought adding oats would be interesting and add some nutrition, but instead the oats took away from the delicate nature of a scone. The flavor was ok, but we didn't like the rough, dry texture.  Since scones are a treat, I will stick to the traditional recipes that are so lovely and delicate.

I had my middle school students make them in FACS class.  We substituted chocolate chips for currants (kids choice). They were easy to make, but came out dry.

Far too dry as written.  i followed the recipe as written and found not nearly enough moisture in only 1/3C of milk for the amount of flour b and oatmeal.  This recipe takes significant modification in order to be passable.

These came out great, my family loved these. I am going to try and add a little honey and maybe a pinch of cinnamon next time. I had zero complaints but my grandmother didn't like how crumbly they turned out. So, maybe a little honey next time will help bind all the ingredients together and add a pinch of extra sweetness. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing. Like others I modified it a bit as im gluten sensitive. I used all oatmeal flour and added some extra moisture with Greek yogurt and additional milk. I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the white, 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup dried cranberries and blueberries. The scones are delectable. To those who had dry results, please don't be discouraged. Biscuit and scone making takes a bit of a nack. Your dough should be sticky and messy to handle. A dry dough makes dry goods so add extra liquid if necessary to get this texture. Also be careful not to overwork the dough, just mix the ingredients thoroughly and then flour your hands lightly to shape. I usually flour lightly again between each, being careful not to incorporate the flour into my dough. I use a lighter flour for this purpose.

I make these in the cold days of winter...nothing better than to have one with a cup of tea in the afternoon. I followed the recipe, and tweaked  it a little , adding chopped dry apple slices, and fresh frozen cranberries  in addition to raisin/ currents. I also use a cast iron frying pan to bake them...give it a nice brown bottom. They are just awesome! Will make them again and again!

I just made this recipe with a couple changes. I replaced the same amount of all purpose flour for spelt flour, added a 1/3 cup of applesauce, and used fresh blueberries. Yum. Will be making these again.

Blech! Blah! Boo! Did not care for texture or taste. Instead of white flour, used Robin Hood Nutri flour blend (tastes like white but is unbleached plus it contains the goodness of oat hull fibre and is used in all my recipes, scone or otherwise), reduced the sugar and used brown instead of white, reduced butter to 3 Tbs. with applesauce for the remainder. Shot of  vanilla. Brown sugar sprinkled on top. It'll be back to non-oatmeal scones from now on...

I altered the recipe a bit, but it came out amazing.  I skipped the currants and added a cup of chopped apples.  Added a touch of cinnamon and switched out the sugar for dark brown sugar.  Then, before baking, I sprinkled them with a touch of Demerara sugar.  Best Scones I have ever had.  I will never make scones without oats again.

I followed the recipe except for using whole wheat flour and brown sugar, also 1/2 cup each of dried cranberries and raisins. The scones came out very nice but unfortunately tasted strongly of baking powder. I'll make them again but will definitely reduce the amount of baking powder by half.

Delicious!  I decreased the oats by 1/2 a cup, increased flour by 1/2 c and sugar to q1/2 cup and added in fresh blueberries and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, then sprinkled the top with white sugar before baking.  These scones are hearty and delicious. Definately a recipe to keep!

Very, very tasty. Skip the currants if you don't like them, these work well plain or with the dried fruit of your choice. They also freeze pretty well, I've been putting the second disk in the freezer wrapped in plastic. Great with jam!

These didn't turn out well. I see great potential! They were way too crumbly and didn't end up staying together during the patting/scoring process.  Then the bottoms burned and they didnt rise while baking. I followed the recipe and made no adjustments. 

Probably won't try again unless I wade through all the other reviews to see what adjustments worked best.

Decent.  Far denser than expected and with a grainy texture.  I left them out before cooking in their sliced circular state, so perhaps that is why?  Either way, the flavor is really good - but I was not a fan of texture and density.  Would try another recipe next time.

Awesome base recipe! If you only want a plain scone with jam use the original recipe. If you want to jazz it up put what you like in eg. lemon rind and blueberries,or apples and cinnamon,or etc etc. If you want a sweeter scone you could add extra sugar which I did as I was not using with jam. I also replaced milk with yogurt as that is what I had.I also make individual scones just drop them on and flatten a bit with hand.

This is my new favorite recipe. The scones come with just a bit of sweetness. They are so simple, with great texture and flavor.

Very tasty!! This was my first time making scones and I found the recipe very easy to work with! I added pecans and cranberries, which made it a very delightful afternoon snack! My family is very impressed:)

I used this as a basic recipe. I didn't use the currants instead I used 1/4 cup of apricot preserves with 1/2 tbsp. of fresh ginger and I also cut the sugar by half and they were great...we ate them for breakfast...thanks for the recipe

I love these scones.  They're not too dry, and the texture is really nice.  Even my 7 year old likes them, and he's really picky.  I sometimes like to dust them with cinnamon sugar before I bake them.  Yummy!

I thought these were simply delicious, as did my 20+ shower guests that helped devour these scones. This recipe is for sure a keeper, and a great base recipe to test out all your different scone ideas! Highly recommended.

came out a little tough and bland but it has potential. I think I'll put less oats and add a tsp of vanilla next time. 

I used 1c of wheat flour and 1/2c of white flour.

I had to try these to see how they compared to the fabulous Grandma Johnson scones that I love.  These too are very good.  I used craisins, which I had on hand.  They are more dense, biscuit-like, and not as sweet - a different kind of scone, but equally good.

I don't know what went wrong but the scones tasted dry and horrid. The top was browned but the when I took it out of the oven, everything fell into a dry, crumbly mess. My guess was that there was too much oats. Anyhow, I won't be using this recipe again.

These were so good, I make them all the time now. They don't take very long to prepare, and they aren't overly sweet, which is great. Sometimes I even cut out a little of the sugar. Also, I use dried cranberries because currants are so expensive.

Very tasty, with a nice texture.  I didn't have any dried fruit, but it didn't hurt it; spreading honey or jam makes up for it quite well.  I'm thinking these could be good with cinnamon, too, but that will be for another day.

These are definitely tastey.  But it ended up coming out more like an oat cake then a scone.  Definitely more liquid is required, because they definitely weren't scone like.  But they did make very nice, slightly sweet oatcakes.

What this recipe for me needs is more sweetness. I used brown sugar like another reviewer suggested. I think it has too much baking powder. I also added the cinnamon and nutmeg  like another reviewer suggested.  Next time I will use applesauce instead of butter and add more raisins and spices. A good place to start.

Wonderful recipe! This was the first time I attempted making scones and I am very pleased. I did not use currants because I did not have any, but I did add cinnamon. The scones are not too sweet...perfect for curling up on a rainy afternoon with a hot cup of tea.

I agree that while these were pretty tasty - I had a couple with a nice pot of afternoon tea - they weren't very scone-like. However, as I am not the world's best baker, I'm not sure how to remedy this... I guess I'll just keep looking. Thanks anyway!

The dough was a bit sticky, but they were so easy to make.  They were a bit dry and were not sweet, but we them that way.  We'll definitely make them again.

I use raisins instead of currants (no currants in sight anywhere here in Jakarta). First time i made it i halved the recipe, and after the dough felt nice, i realise i haven't put the egg in. so, i divided the dough into 6, and rolled them in the beaten egg, then flatten it (too lazy to flatten it using rolling pin), then bake it. it tastes YUMMY. I usually make the grandma johnson's scones, but this one is healthier and i feel much better eating this than the grany johnson's. Seriously, this easily beats oatmeal scones sold at starbucs here hands down.

These were great for a  quick fix, but they turned out a little dry. I might add a bit more liquid next time. Don' t forget your favorite hot drink to wash it down

I used raisins instead of currants. These were so good my husband and I ate all 16 in less than 2 days.

Pretty good, but definately needed to add more sugar!  They had a very "healthy" taste to them and were good served warm with maybe melted butter and sprinkled with sugar.  Just needed a little more "sweet flavoring".  I guess I just should have doubled the sugar.  But good!

I really enjoyed making these - I used cut-up dried apricots and added some honey, too.  The mix was very very sticky, which made it difficult to shape these into english-muffin-sized rounds.  I also confused baking powder and baking soda, but luckily the end result was still delicious.  I brushed the tops with milk and sprinkled with sugar before baking, which gave each scone a nice crunchy outer shell.  We ate these topped with apricot-peach preserves and whipped cream.   Yum!

One of our family favorites, we have passed this one on to many friends. My husband makes them on Saturday mornings on a regular basis. He substitutes craisins for the currants.

Yummy!  They do not look so beautiful when they are done, but they taste delicious!  I followed other reveiwers' suggestions and added cinnamon and a little more sugar, and I used raisins instead of currants.  Crumbly but delicious!

This is a perfect "morning with coffee scone" ... actually anytime scone, and it's easy to doctor it up a little without ruining the great original flavor. Try adding a little more sugar and bit of almond extract... yum!

We did not like these at all.  They were pretty dry, and they fell apart too easy.  I wont be making them again, sorry.

Great flavor and texture.  Only changes I made was substituted buttermilk for milk, and added some almond extract, and a little more sugar.  Even finicky son liked this with his coffee.

Satisfying.  I made these for our breakfast this morning, and they turned out perfect.  I used quick oats instead of the bigger rolled oats without any brpblems.  I did have to cook them longer than specified in order for them not to be doughy.  I served these with butter that I mixed with cinnamon and brown sugar.  Delicious and very filling.

Pretty good.  I wasn't too sure on the definition of "scone" - they go from fairly cookie-like things to the airy biscuits you can get at some coffee shops - and these are definitely more on the cookie end.  I baked them for about 12 minutes and that was enough, or they would have gone crumbly. Some looked great but some biscuits basically crumbled in half, as the dough is not very sticky, but they all tasted quite good.  More of a "dessert" item than your average scone as these have more flavour; went great with Cinnabutter but I think Jam would be overkill.
