This sauce was THE BEST! I didn't have any bourbon whiskey, so I used a vanilla extract/water substitution. I added a little extra honey and ketchup, and fell in love. It goes from being sweet and tangy, to smoky and spicy. Definitely one of the best sauces I've ever had.

This recipe is amazing. For best results make sure to use bourbon since it is important for the flavor and let the sauce sit in the fridge for a day or so. Adding 1-2 tsp of Tabasco sauce will also add some more heat if you're looking for something more spicy.

I was looking for a sauce a little different than the basic Buffalo Wing Sauce.  So I thought I would try this one.  

Fired up my Big Green Egg and threw on 36 wings....tossed them in this sauce....and OH MY!!  We have a winner!  This sauce is excellent...starts sweet, hint of bourdon, and finishes spicy.  Excellent flavor and will now become a main sauce I will use on my wings.

Made these as directed and my lips are still tingling.  We love how you get a little sweet then wham spicy.  Fried up a whole bag of wings and now they are all gone.  No leftovers for tomorrow.  Next time, I'm going to make 2 bags.

Love the recipe. Added about 4 tablesppons of sriracha sauce to the mix, and grilled shrimp with it. Excellent flavor, with the right amount of kick.

Hey, I didn't have any vanilla extract so had to use "JACK" for the sauce and one for me.

I have to admit that I am surprised that there weren't more complaints about how strong the bourbon flavor was?!  Personally, I found the flavor overwhelmed all else.  Maybe I will have to try the vanilla next time?

I made this sauce and put it over cubed cooked chicken.  I thought it was a good sauce, but the bourbon was a little strong.  I think next time I will double the sugar,ketchup,cayenne, and garlic powder.  All in all I liked the sauce but would like better with a more diluted bourbon taste.

I too made a vanilla extract/water substitution for the bourbon.  Came out great.   Will definitely make this again.

This was amazing! I made Buffalo style wings for the first time ever (came out awesome, btw! ; ) ) and I had to include this recipe on the side because I am a fan of Jim Beam Black bourbon! I doubled the ingredients and it gave me plenty left over to store in the fridge for future use! It was fantastic! I got many compliments Superbowl Sunday (Giants Fan)! I love HOT stuff, but I didn't taint this recipe. I guess you could experiment to kick up the heat. Enjoy, we sure did!

Oh, just stop all the talk about substituting vanilla for bourbon whiskey.  How can you say the sauce was THE BEST if you didn't even use the whiskey?  The whiskey is the main ingredient for the sauce!!  If you don't like whiskey, you might not like the taste.  It is a good sauce, I make it the night before so the flavors meld.  Thank you Steve!

My family doesn't like hot stuff, so I left out the pepper, only put in a few drops of the hot sauce, then I added a half cup of apricot preserves.  It was a hit.  I didn't use chicken either, I put it on pork ribs.

I just made this for some Super Bowl wings and it is awesome! Such  a perfect flavor and sweet and hot.  I think I could put this on so much more than just wings! Delicious!

I tried this for the first time tonight exactly as written.  After simmering I dipped a spoon, turned and tasted...I literally spun around and stared at the pot.  It was incredible!!!  Had my buddy over for wings and he said they were the best wings he's ever eaten and I have to agree.  The bourbon smell is heavy but blends perfectly for an initial taste of sweetness with a heat that creeps up but doesn't overpower.  

I do a lot of BBQ and can't wait to try this on my next rack of smoked ribs.

Absolutely perfect!!!

Awesome sauce!  I wouldn't recommend substituting the Bourbon as its unique flavor really sets this sauce apart.  I let it cool overnight, then actually basted my wings before grilling them.  I made extra so I could toss them  well.  Don't need any blue cheese with these, sauce is amazing!

This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I served my wings which had been marinated in a soy sauce mixture and baked in the oven with 3 sauces--Steve's, ranch, and blue cheese.  Once we tasted Steve's the other two remained untouched.  Definitely making again.

Made this recipe along a couple more and loved it! My acquaintances gobbled ALL the wings in a blink of an eye. Nothing left except the bones and some were even chewing on the bones too! I made these sauces  the day before and the bourbon taste was greatly enhanced. Once mixed with the wings the taste was still predominant but suttle. This recipe is a keeper and will make them again and again but this time will wait after two days to see how it turns out. I'm sure it'll be better.

DELICIOUS! I've made this three weeks in a row, and my family cannot get enough of it. I lessened the sugar and butter to cut down the calories and it's still delicious. Great way to spice up any type of chicken!

This sauce is very good, but I don't consider it a Buffalo Wing Sauce as it is more sweet and not much if at all heat.  It has a tang to it.  The guests at my party who don't like buffalo wings because of their spiciness loved it.  If I make it again, I'll definitely add more bourbon and more heat and will update!

This has a very good flavor combination of sweet and savory...however, it is not spicy. So, if you are looking for more of a 'hot' wing maybe add more hot sauce and/or cayenne.

I have made this several times now and definitely love it. I didn't have bourbon or honey BUT I had Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey! let me tell you that worked perfectly! and I was reading between two recipes and added Worcestershire, but  that is a great addition to this! only gave  four stars because I didn't quite follow the recipe! this is my go-to for wings!

These wings are amazing seeing as though I am sweet on bourbon and or whiskey (get it??). No really, the wings were
really tasty, I tossed them in some light flour, Wondra O yea I put some salt, pepper and smoked paprika on them BEFORE I floured and fried them. I just added some chilula hot sauce into the mix and they were awesome. SOOOOOO good. I will definitely be making them again.

A new taste i have to say. I was expecting more of a hot zing but got more of a bbq taste. Although expecting something else it was still delicious.

I loved this sauce! I fried my chicken wings first, no breading just naked chicken wings in the deep fryer and I shook them In the sauce PERFECT! I will have to admit the bourbon is strong in this recipe after all I was eating bourbon chicken wings....Will definitely make again!

This is a 5 star sauce with a modifcation. For the people who say it was too sweet and want more heat... I used "reduced sugar" ketchup, left out the 1/4 of brown sugar and just used the 1 Tablespoon of honey. Then used Tobasco Habenero sauce and doubled the cayenne. Less sweet with twice the heat. Perfect. (Optional.. take the pan and smoke the sauce with hickory wood in your grill or smoker.)

This is okay, but I still prefer the top-rated wing recipe here on AR. I really wanted to try this sauce but didn't have wings; instead I made oven-fried chicken legs with backs. I doubled the sauce, but used half ketchup and half bbq sauce. I only had Irish whiskey, so I used that. I really think that if using chicken pieces as opposed to wings they should be fried... Wings are smaller, so you can still achieve that crispiness in the oven. Nothing wrong with traditional wings though!

I rate very few recipes, but this sauce was amazing.  I was looking for a change from standard buffalo wings, and decided to give it a try.
I bake my wings in a hot oven after tossing in flour, seasonings, and baking powder, and then toss with the sauce.
I made the sauce exactly as specified (I try not to modify recipes the first time I make them!) although I did forget the sesame seeds.  They were incredible.  Thankfully I did not have as many guests as expected, because I couldn't stop eating them...  Next time I might try cutting the sugar just a bit, and adding a little more heat... but honestly they are great the way they are.  Thanks Steve!

Great sauce and rave reviews from those that have eaten it.

My daughters and I made a version of this for a BBQ competition and took third in the People's choice wing competition.  We did make some adjustments- I do a 4x version, but take 1 cup bourbon and boil it to about a teaspoon.  I then add that to the regular recipe- adjusting the amounts based on the hot sauce I use until I get sweet/ smoky on the front with a kick of heat on the back end.  I think this recipe gives a nice balance of favors as nothing overpowers the others when done right.

Totally loved this!!! Even made it twice in one week! Second time i did cut down on the sugar tho, and it still came out as perfect as ever. Followed the instructions to the last dot. No disappointment whatsoever. Friends absolutely loved it too! Thanks Steve.

I liked it but thought it was a bit sweet. Its missing some components that I can't figure out...maybe a little tang and smokiness to it?

Good base for this recipe but we needed something more spicy and this just didn't cut it for us.

WOW, this sauce is awesome!  I made this because the others like hot sauces but I’m usually a sauce on the side kind of person. Not this time, I couldn’t get enough and will definitely be making it again and again. Not too hot and just enough sweet to cut the heat for me. I do like a little heat but usual wing sauce is a bit much for me to drench a wing in. I am already thinking of all the things I can put this sauce on and how in the future I may double the recipe to have a little more for dipping. Thank you for sharing.

Wow, this sauce was amazing.
I smoked the wings and tossed them in this prior to serving.
AMAZING
I didn't have honey so i substituted Agave Nector
I didn't have Franks so i substituted Valentina
Everyone that had them thought they were delicious.
Thanks for the Recipe!

This sauce is amazing!! Made traditional wings and then a batch of these. Huge hit with all my friends. It’s so tasty I will be using it to put on other things. My girlfriend took the leftover and put it on popcorn!! Lol

I scaled down the JD whiskey just a small bit, to give it a tempting whisper; done all other ingredients as directed.  Yummm....TGI Fridays and Applebee's comes to mind, for some strange wonderful reason!! THIS recipe however, is far more fun to make---and has other tasty purposes. You can sub small fine diced fresh onions ( caramelized, if you wish ) for the sesame seeds.  This sauce recipe is a keeper at my home!!

I didn't have boubon so substituted peach whisky, added 1 TSP vanilla  used Jim Bean hot sauce and omitted the cayan pepper. This had the perfect amount of heat and the peach whisky gave it a great mildly fruit flavor that is perfect on chicken!!!! Definitely will make this again!

Great recipe. I doubled it used vanilla in place of Bourbon and used over chicken breasts in a slow cooker. Excellent when pulled. Definitely has a surprise kick at the end.

Amazing sauce. We use the baked version (top review) of the restaurant style wing recipe on allrecipes and then coat them with this sauce. Bake the wings a long time to get them crispy eg 400 for ~45 minutes and they are amazing! We use Sriracha instead of Frank's but you could use whatever (we've also used Tabasco).

A little too sweet for us but very good sauce. A great alternative to buffalo sauce.

I did use  Crown Royal and the hot sauce I used was Valentina. Everything else as listed in the recipe. I did baked wings, and when they were almost finished baking, I drained any juice off, and slathered them in this sauce. Baked till finished and put them under the broiler for a few minutes. Very good! Saved a bit of sauce for dipping.  Not near as spicy as I expected it to be. (But, that was a good thing for me)

Pretty good- I made it as directed only doubled the recipe for 24 wings and added a splash of soy sauce, and brought to a boil and cooked at medium heat for 10 minutes after the simmering for 15 minutes on low didn't reduce and thicken the sauce. I  put out a bowl of this sauce for dipping the deep fried crispy wings. Would make again.

great recipe! VERY SPICY.  a little to spicy for my in laws so I cut it with extra honey and ketchup. it doesn't make very much so I'd double or triple the recipe if you're cooking for more than 3 people. !

Hubby has an aversion to hot, so we omitted the cayenne and hot sauce. Poured over sautéed chicken breast cubes and cooked to caramelize it just a bit. Served over white rice. Hubby and adult daughter raved over it with every other bite. Definitely adding to our rotation!

I really had high hopes for this sauce. And it's not a bad sauce for what it is - Bourbon Sweet and Sour Sauce. But! I was really craving Buffalo Sauce, not Sweet and Sour. I should have considered all the ingredients first. This sauce is waaayy too sweet for me. Bourbon, Brown Sugar, Ketchup, and Honey.. All Sweet. All large amounts. For me, this sauce needs much more HEAT. I had to add much more hot sauce, cayenne and other peppers to try to combat the sugar content. And yes, as much as I love bourbon - I could use about a third less. Which equals more for me to drink later. It is not my intention to completely trash this recipe - but I just wish it hadn't gotten my hopes up for something that it wasn't.

I made this sauce as is the first time and it was good, but my husband thought the bourbon flavor was a bit strong. The second time I made it I substituted apple juice for 1/2 of the bourbon and added 1/2 tbsp of worchestershire and it was perfect. thanks for the recipe

Thanks,I enjoyed these. For the Bourban I used Red Stag,  for the hot sauce i used Daves red Pepper sauce. It was really good, wish I had more wings. Sticky and sweet  with that strong Stag note! Very good thanks. Blue Cheese recommended!
