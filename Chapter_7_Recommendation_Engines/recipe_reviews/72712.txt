i love risotto, and this was a very good flavor combination! but 1/2 of a zucchini is definitely not enough!! i used a whole zucchini plus some yellow squash. i added the sun dried tomatoes about half way through cooking so that they would flavor the rice more. i also doubled the cheese (i used freshly shaved asiago) because I love cheese :) but it tasted pretty flavorful before i added the cheese, so you can definitely leave out the cheese or use less if you are trying to reduce fat. i made this today for my mom's birthday and she loved it!

risotto is intimidating because of all of the stirring. As much as I cook, I still cannot get rice to work, so how was I going to make something as complicated as risotto?  Thanks to this recipe (my inaugural attempt), my risotto was wonderful.  Being a WeightWatcher girl, I did not add the parmesan cheese to the top (didn't miss it) and added lots of veggies.  I too rough chopped my zucchini, and added chopped fresh broccoli and sweet peas (at the very end).  I'd recommend carrots too.

One happy note: I did not "stir continuously".  Instead I used a very good pot and stirred "quite often", until the end.  When the mixture thickened, I "stirred continuously" and voila! No blob.  

Thanks for the great recipe.

This was my first risotto attempt and it worked out pretty well.  I was cooking for 2 so I scaled back the ingredients as follows(which made enough for 3):  

4 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup rice
1/2 sweet onion chopped
2 small carrots chopped
5 sun dried tomatoes (used the kind packed in oil) 
1 zucchini chopped
1 tablespoon dried thyme
3 tablespoons fresh grated parmesan
~ 12 small basil leaves sliced width-wise

I sauteed the carrots and onions together first, then added the rice and followed the rest of the recipe as instructed.  Carrots sweeted it up a bit and the basil should not be skipped - it added a really nice flavor.  With constant stirring over medium heat, the risotto probably took about 30 minutes total to cook.  My fiance liked it and I enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day.  I will make this again!

Loved this recipe!! I followed directions exactly; but used 1/2 teaspoon dried basil since I did not have fresh. Is definitely a keeper !! Thanks for the recipe.

This was an excellent recipe. The flavor was perfect. The only changes I made were to add 5 or 6 leaves of fresh basil, I used an entire zucchini instead of half, marinated sun dried tomatoes and I used more parm. Oh and freshly ground pepper. Yum!

This was the best side dish I've made in a long time! I substitued 1 cup of low sodium broth with 1 cup of a  dry white wine, which added a lot of flavor. I used dried thyme and basil and didn't miss the fresh herb taste. This recipe is a keeper!

We really enjoyed this! A veggie dish that doesn't taste like it's missing meat at all. I doubled the onion, zucchini and sundried tomatoes and added a little garlic. It was nowhere near bland despite the fact that I forgot to add the thyme completely. My sundried tomatoes were marinated with herbs and that more than a made up for the lack of thyme. I like my veggies chunky and crunchy so I cut the zucchini into bigger bits, but I may slice them thinner next time, as the recipe suggest, as my boyfriend said the chunks reminded him of his childhood when he didn't like zucchini as a side dish. Fair enough. Will definitely make this healthy feeling and delicious risotto again.

WOW! I love risotti but I never thought of using sun-dried tomatoes in them! They really give a special kick to this creamy dish. I used feta because I had some that would have gone bad otherwise but I'm sure it's great with parmesan too. And I also like the fact that you can play on the zucchini/rice ratio to make it an healthier dish.

Yum!  The changes I made: replaced 1st cup of broth with wine, used 2 zucchinis, doubled the tomato, and used 20 leaves of basil.  I also added fresh thyme because I had it.  I added the zucchini and tomato before I added the last two cups of liquid.  I also mixed in all 6 tbsp of parm.  It was yum!

SUCH a good recipe!  Per several reviewers, I used a full zucchini (I shredded mine so the kids wouldn't see it and be suspicious, lol~) and double the sun-dried tomatoes.  I used an entire small jar of sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil - it was probably 20 or so.  The result was supremely delicious!!  The next day my kids and I all ate the leftovers with some shredded chicken thrown in and it was just as good.  Definitely a keeper!

This was really great.  I chopped the zucchini coarsely and added it at the beginning with the onion, I also included some coarsely chopped red pepper. The vegetables were soft but provided outstanding flavor.  I highly recommend this, it wasn't nearly as difficult as I had built it up to be.  I am excited to try this again with different blends of vegetables.

This was delicious.  I've never had risotto without adding white wine but I didn't miss it at all and it makes the dish cheaper.  Remember to add the stock little by little - I use a soup laddle and once the liquid has absorbed I add another laddle full.  I served with shrimp.

This was quite labor-intensive to make and the flavor was lacking. As a full-time working mother and wife, I need recipes that are healthy, delicious and quick - this is not one of them. I love risotto and was hoping this would turn out well, but it's in desperate need of garlic salt and something else. Not a big fan of the addition of the thyme, and I usually like thyme. Definitely will not make this again. Only reason hubby and I ate it was because we can't stand to waste food.

We didn't like this risotto very much. I thought the sundried tomatoes were overpowering, and that the more traditional risotto ingredients, including white wine and shallots would have improved the recipe.

Okay I thought I hated risotto because I associated it with being creamy and mushy and filled with mushrooms. But this is sooooooooo delicious. I don't like the photo that goes with this recipe because it makes it look really creamy and disgusting, which it is not. Look at some of the other photos for a better idea of the final product. I pretty much doubled all the veggies, as a lot of other people did.  I didn't have any fresh basil but I know it would be amazing if you added that. Definitely don't skip the sundried tomatoes or the parmesan cheese; that's where most of the flavor comes from. Also as long as you are using a nonstick pan, don't worry about stirring continuously. Actually the first time I made it I read it wrong and dumped all the broth in at once and it turned out great. REALLY GOOD RECIPE! Thank you!

I LOVED this...kids didn't even realize there were VEGGIES in the rice!  I added more zucchini and will probably add some yellow squash next time too.  My husband wasn't thrilled with the sun dried tomatos but I really liked them.  :)  Definitely a keeper, I'm going to be trying LOTS of variations.  
ALSO, I was slightly intimidated by ristotto but this was SUPER easy.  TRY IT!!!!!!

Loved loved loved the flavors in this risotto!  Do soak the sundried tomatoes in hot water for 20 minutes to soften as suggested--they'll release much better flavor into the risotto.  I also used the whole zucchini--much better veggie to starch ratio.  Also, before adding in the stock slowly I added 1 cup of sauvignon blanc because I'm a vino.

I just wasn't crazy about this. I followed the recipe for the most part except for adding more zucchini and more parm cheese. Still, the combination of flavors just didn't do it for me or my family.

I loved this meal! Instead of chicken stock, I used vegetable stock which was really yummy. I also added a handful of chopped bacon when I cooked the onion which added a nice flavour. To make it a little heartier, I added extra sundried tomatos and zucchini. Found this to be a really filling and yummy meal - the leftovers flew out of the fridge!!!

Delicious. I substituted the first cup of liquid with white wine (I think this is such a critical flavor/acid for risotto). I followed other tips to double the zucchini, which I also rough chopped and lightly sauteed before starting the rice. I'm not a huge sundried tomato fan, so I actually halved that amount, but the smokiness was really nice in the dish. I also fried two chopped slices of bacon, set aside until adding at the end, but cooked the onion in some of the reserved grease in addition to the butter.  Overall a big hit that will definitely get made again, but I think next time I will skip the bacon and up the amount of cheese for a different spin on it.

I made this as directed except I used shredded zucchini, left over from bread, and I used a half cup of dry white wine to deglaze the pan after toasting the rice.  It was very good though not the best risotto I've ever made.  It's a great way to use up some of my overly abundant zucchini crop! Thanks.

When cooking arborio rice you have to commit to stirring a lot. If you have the time to do that then this dish is definitely worth it. I despise sun dried tomatoes and so I skipped them, I added red pepper instead. I also added a summer squash in addition to the zucchini.  Great dish!

Flavor was wonderful, though I never got the creamy texture I was expecting even after playing around with the liquid.  Perhaps I just need a little risotto making practice which is okay because I will definitely make this again.

Actually I give 4,5 stars. The recipe is good, but I realized zucchini (maybe it was my zucchini?) doesn`t give much flavor, otherwise sun-dried tomatoes, thyme and basil make a delicate and good combination. I used mozzarella and I think it doesn`t give much flavor too, just thickening. So maybe parmesan would work better. In whole, this is a good idea, but with modifications from me.

Hmmmm... I think I was looking for it to taste like the risotto at a restaurant I used to work for.  It was my first attempt at risotto and the consistency and texture were great but I didn't love the flavor.

Good recipe. I did not add the sun-dried tomatoes and I used basil instead of thyme. I also cubed the zucchini and gave it a quick stir-fry before adding it to the risotto. Served with grilled shrimp. Quite tasty.

Very nice!  Prepared as written, but cut zucchini chunky and used marinated sundried tomatoes. Got a hubby thumbs up too.

The cook time was alot longer than 30 minutes. This was my first time preparing Risotto.  The flavor was wonderful.  However, the texture of my Risotto was not quite al dente.  I concocted a sticky, crunchy mess. Does anyone have preperation tips?

This turned out to be really creamy and tasty. The only thing I changed was taking out the thyme and sun dried tomatoes. I added mushrooms and fresh chopped tomatoes. I stirred in the zucchini and mushrooms, after cooking them for a little bit, while the rice was still cooking. Once the risotto was done, I added the basil, cheese(lots of it), and tomatoes. Also, I added garlic powder, since that was recommended from the other reviews. It was really yummy, and I will make this again. :)

Very good recipe.  I added chopped pancetta since I had it on hand and it added a bit of oomph.  I used 2 small zucchinis and added them as the risotto was cooking. Used dried basil as I didn't have any fresh.  Will definitely make again!

Wow...very creamy and flavorful.  I used a whole zucchini.  Veggie or chicken broth makes this risotto equally tasty.  Leftovers taste just as good as the next day.  Great dish-made it twice in one week.

This is a yummy recipe, and relatively light, compared to many other risotto recipes (for example, the one I usually use from America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook). The texture is really excellent. It's not QUITE as tasty as the one I usually make, so I took one star off. Also, you should REALLY like sundried tomatoes to make this- they are quite strong and the aftertaste can be a bit much for an otherwise mild dish.

I had never made risotto before, but this was easy to make and so delicious.  I added three cloves of garlic with the onions, added some sliced carrots along with the rice, and sliced the zucchini thinly with a mandolin.  Since I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes on hand, I used a cut up fresh tomato.  The combination of colors made an appealing dish.  I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and had plenty for two main meals even when my husband had seconds.  Liked the thyme/basil combo.  Excellent dish and will make again.

delicious and surprisingly easy! one suggestion: when you start adding the simmering broth, you don't need to add ALL of it. i made that mistake and had to ladle some broth back out.

other than that - super yummy, i'll definitely be making this again.

I did not have sun dried tomato, but I added a TBS of lemon juice. It turned out delicious. The lemon juice really brought out the taste of zucchini. 

I used Parmesan cheese and also added a little bit of white wine.

Great recipe. I used one carton of veggie broth and one carton of chicken broth. I didn't have any sun-dried tomatoes, so I chopped up a red pepper and threw those in with the onions. Went heavy on the basil and also threw in some roasted chicken breast that I had left over. I could eat this all day. Does take a lot of stirring, but on medium heat, I was able to walk away for a few minutes at a time and did not experience any burning at the bottom of the pan.  I can see why the zucchini had to be thinly sliced because it only went in at the end. The thinness helped it cook fast, but if you want to rough chop it, throw it in a little earlier on.

We loved the flavor, and it was so filling! I added a lot more zucchini - 1 medium and one small - and thought it was great that way. I didn't slice it that thin with a peeler, but really liked the thicker pieces. Also added about 1/4 c cream. Delicious!

This risotto turned out amazing. I used leeks in place of the onion and used a full medium zucchini. Also we found that the basil "made" the dish. It was just good before but after adding the basil it was great. Thumbs way up from all my family. My seven year old is excited that there are leftovers for her to take to school tomorrow for lunch.

Very yummy!  I've never made risotto before, and this was very easy.  I had to sub a few things based on what I had on hand... sun dried tomato pesto for the sun dried tomatoes and much more zucchini.  It will be a nice dish to accompany our roasted chicken!

Great recipe! I followed original for the most part, just added some fresh mushrooms, garlic, carrots & more zucchini.  Delicious! Even a hit with the anti-veggie daughter.  Next time, I think I will leave out the sun dried tomatoes and add some roasted garlic (just a personal preference, not a big fan of the sun dried).   I served this as a main course with a caprese salad.  It served 2 adults, 3 kids & have plenty of leftovers.  I think it'd also make a great sidedish to grilled meat or fish.  Thanks for a delicious, versatile recipe!

As written, I have to give it three stars, but with my changes it is definitely a five star dish. I omitted the sun-dried tomatoes because we don't really like them. And I had fresh garden zucchini to use up. We love zucchini, so I added more than the recipe called for. I halved the recipe and used a whole zucchini. Half of a zucchini for 6 servings? I wouldn't call it "Zucchini Risotto" if it only had that much. So I would definitely use two zucchinis for a whole batch. I also found that I needed more stock than was stated; about a cup extra for the half batch. I substituted olive oil for the butter and that worked just fine. With these changes, we absolutely loved this recipe. Even if you don't omit the tomatoes, add more zucchini.

Fan-tas-tic!!! Made this for dinner last night and it's a "serve to company" kind of dish.  Made a few mods: halved the recipe as I am cooking for two (it made 3 good size servings), added 8 oz of sliced cremini mushrooms, 3 baby carrots and a tablespoon of minced garlic to the onion saute in the beginning (then added rice and broth, etc), doubled the thyme (1 t. for half batch) and used 10 fresh basil leaves.  It took about 20 minutes for the rice to be done, added zucchini ribbons and sun dried tomatoes (yum!) and stirred for another few minutes.  Wah-la...done.  Now I do have to admit, I broke the rules and did not stir "constantly"...more like I was standing right there and stirred very frequently (slice one carrot, stir, slice another carrot, stir, etc). It still turned out perfect. Creamy, flavorful and all around a keeper!  Try it...you'll like it!

Best risotto I've made; quite simple and doesn't use a bunch of ingredients that I don't have on hand.

I followed this recipe quite literaly, something I don't do often -- somehow I felt confident in it and I think I was right. This turned out to be an outstanding risotto. I ate it with my family with a dry white wine, and they all loved it.

A perfect bowl of comfort on this cold and soggy day. I love the thin strips of zucchini; the sun-dried tomatoes are little bursts of flavor. Mmmmm!

I enjoyed this (but I enjoy most risottos!). The flavor of the thyme was more pronounced than I would like. The sun dried tomato and zucchini ribbons added interesting texture. Overall I thought this was very good.

I found this very salty and i did not add any salt at all.  Next time i will use a low sodium chicken stock.  It also takes longer than the 30 min estimated.  At 30 min it is still a bit crunchy.  

Not sure if i would try this one again or not.  It was okay.

Just make sure you use low sodium broth.. it's easier to add salt than it is to take it away.

This was my first time making risotto. I added some extra cheese (mozzarella, asiago, romano, and smoked par) and I also added yellow squash on top of the zucchini. It was fabulous. Now I don't have to go to a fancy restaurant and pay tons of cash when I could make it at home.

Delicious recipe!  I used chicken stock and chopped the zucchini into small pieces.  Make sure you don't peel the zucchini as the dark green looks great with he sun dried tomatoes. I only made 1/2 the recipe, but next time I will make the whole thing!  Some shrimp thrown in at the end would make a great meal!

Yum.  I added extra veggies like carrots and extra zucchini and forgot about the thyme until it was too late. Parmesan was best on it, but I had some Monterrey Jack and that was good too.  We ate it up.

Great recipe that didn't require wine.  Made a few alterations.  For one, I added way more zucchini than it called for (because I wanted to use 'em up) and I also added sauteed mushrooms.  So good!  and not hard at all :)

I cut the thyme in half since it is such.a strong herb. This was good but. I didn't love it enough to keep it. I think it is just personal taste that I am not that fond of thyme.

My husband is intolerent to wheat, cow's milk, and onions and I'm sure he's not the only one out there, which is why I decided to write this review.  I made a few modifcations to the recipe so he could have it. First I made my own broth (good luck find pre-made broth with no onions), then substituted sunchokes for the onion, and used a vegan, non-dairy cheese in place of the cow's milk cheese. I have to say the end results was good and for those who are custom to eating non-dairy cheese it won't be bad. For those who haven't eaten non-dairy cheese, well all I can say is, be open minded.

My husband and I do not like sundried tomatoes so we used fresh tomatoes.  It still tasted very nice but I would add extra tomatoes.  They really do make the dish.

This risotto recipe was okay. I wasn't crazy about the sun-dried tomato flavor paired with the zucchini. This is great as a base recipe to add whatever mix-ins you prefer but on its own, it's nothing amazing.

Used large chicken broth and a chicken broth that was already flavored with spices and white wine. Used 2 Zucchini and double the Basil and tomatoes. Used 8TBS Parm Cheese. Added Rot. Chicken -that I allowed to simmer in the pot full of simmering broth. I also added a steam basket for a few min and let the Zucchini steam in the broth at the beginning so that they woule be partially cooked. My husband who doesn't even like rice loved this. My kids ate it ( after they picked out the tomatoes :-)

Really liked this recipe, even though it was a little time and effort intensive. We ran out of chicken stock and so used some wine and think it made a nice touch. We also added chicken. 

Great flavor and very filling. Will make again!

This recipe got great reviews out of my very picky clan.  The only changes I made were 1) I had to add more broth and 2) I excluded the tomatoes b/c I'm the only one in my house that likes them.

My new FAVORITE risotto!  In my mind, risotto must must be cooked with white wine.  So I substituted about 1 cup of chicken broth with  a pinot grigio, which resulted in PERFECTION!  Sun-dried tomatoes were surprisingly mellow in this dish, but added the perfect dash of color and flavor.  I also used equal parts parmesan and asiago.  Served with pan-seared scallops - A HUGE HIT!

This was my first attempt at Risotto (also my first time reviewing).  Thank you so much for the simple recipe and instructions.  It turned out great!  My husband and my young son loved it.  I added carrots with the onions as another reviewer mentioned and didn't have any parmesan.  It was still delicious.

I loved the flavor combination.  I halved the recipe but doubled the zucchini and sundried tomatoes.  I used fresh basil from my garden and gruyere cheese because that's what i had on hand.  It was fantastic!  I will definitely make this again. :)

I adore risotto and to be honest, I thought that this was lacking. I love the concept of it but IMO, it needs MORE tomatoes, MORE basil, some SALT, and wine + butter like traditional risotto. The flavor was overall a little bland. Just using thyme and pepper doesn't really do it for me. Looking for the best risotto recipe ever? Try bacon and mushroom risotto. Can't go wrong.

Very tasty and filling. Possibly a little on the salty side, but overall a really nice dish. Will make again.

The recipe was easy to follow and tasty, although the flavor was mild.  I added salt as I cooked and my husband added more at the table.  I'll use more thyme next time.  I may also use a squeeze of lemon and/or some red pepper flakes to give it a bit more zing.

I would have liked this to be a bit more flavorful and creamy.  If I try it again I might add a few tablespoons of butter towards the end.  The sun dried tomatoes were a nice addition though.

This was my first time making Risotto and it was MUCH easier thank I expected. I halved the recipe and added several diced baby carrots to the onion mixture in the beginning (as suggested by another reviewer). I also used a sheeps milk cheese as I didn't have any parmesan on hand and it turned out delicious! Other reviewers have said the cheeseisn't necessary, but I tried the Risotto before and after adding the cheese and I think that it really adds to the dish.

Yummy!  I made a special trip to the store to get sundried tomatoes.  The one mistake I made was adding salt when I cooked the risotto.  I forgot that the cheese and broth would add enough salt.  I also had to look up how to "soften" the tomatoes (soaking them in hot water).  This is good as is, but I could see adding any vegetables to suit.  Will definitey make this again.

This was a big hit tonight with my guests!  It was easy to prepare.  I added 1/4 cup of white wine to the rice and let it cook down before adding the the chicken stock.  It was delicious!

So, I did a very improvised version- I used boullion and water instead of chicken stock (which was too salty, so I would decrease the boullion to about 4 or 5 cubes to 7 c. water); I didn't know what Arborio rice was, so I just used regular long grain rice and it worked out fine.  A few things to note for next time: add more vegetables (i.e. mushrooms, yellow squash, etc.), add less boullion and cut up veggies smaller. I think this is a POTENTIAL 4 star!  What I made was more 2 1/2 star because of salt! Oh, and be prepared to do a LOT of stirring!

This was really delicious.  I made it for dinner party I threw for my dad's birthday.  I served it as a side for 10 people and there was plenty for the next day.  Do NOT skip the sun dried tomatoes, even if it means going to the store in the rain.  It gives this dish color and fabulous flavor.  I did follow the recipe exactly and the one thing I wish I had done differently was my choice of stock.  I used veg instead of chicken and the dish definitely came out a dark tan color.  It might have looked a little creamier and more appetizing with chicken stock instead.  Still tasted fantastic though!

I ended up adding white wine to this since I had just a glass left in the bottle.  It was FANTASTIC.  I make risotto quite often and this recipe is for sure a keeper... creamy, delicious and good for you!

This was sooooo good! I made it exactly the way the recipe calls for, except I probably added more parmesan cheese. It was full of flavor, I got the texture just right, and very filling without being heavy. I will be making this again!

A fantastic risotto. The thyme adds a wonderful flavor and the sun-dried tomato's give it a delicious meatiness.

I found this recipe really good but made some modifications. I added 50 ml of bordeaux red wine not long before ready, which coloured and spiced the risotto a little bit. Besides I added more parmesan (approx. 5 tablespoon for 4 persons) as this crowns a risotto for me.  We drank Lemberger (Blaufrankisch) rosé to it.

I loved it!  My first time making risotta and it was a winner.  I altered the recipe slightly:  First off, I cut the recipe to 3 servings instead of 6.  Then I added 1/3 cup of wine during the first reduction, a blend of basil and garlic for the last step (and more of it which gave it a pesto-essence), and added all the cheese in the end.  Turned out amazing.  Thanks so much!!!

I loved this! It tasted amazing.  This was my first time making risotto and I was nervous but it came out great.  I didn't have sun dried tomatoes but it didn't effect the flavor at all.  I also added a red bell pepper for color and more veggies.  Honestly, this was one of the best meals I've ever made!

SOOOO amazingly good AND easy!  Don't get me wrong-this puppy takes time to make, it's easy but not quick.  It's good even without sun dried tomatoes and you don't need to stir it constantly like other risotto recipes.  Everyone loved it!

this recipe is outstanding.  i have never made risotto before, so like many others, i too was a bit intimidated.  it was however very easy, and very delicious!!  i added carrots and peas along with the zucchini and tomatoe.  yummy, colorful, and good for you to boot.  i even forgot to add the cheese and it was still one of the best dishes i have ever cooked!

I had never made Risotto before, and this turned out well.  Next time, though, I'll definitely use chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, as the vegetable stock turned my Risotto a strange pink color. I left out the tomatoes and used different herbs.  Overall, this was tasty.  I served it as a side dish with fish.  In the future, I'll only make it with main dishes that go in the oven, as the risotto had to be babysat constantly.

This was wonderful.  I, too, added sauteed, chopped carrots, but I don't think it was necessary to saute first since they cooked with the risotto for half an hour.  It was very easy to make - my first attempt at risotto!  I halved the recipe, which made about six side dish servings for me.

THis was delicious. I used asiago and precrumbled parmesan cheese. Served over a portobello mushroom and covered with red pepper sauce. It was simple and easy, will definitely make again!

I've tried many types of risotto but I hadn't thought of doing it with zucchini. This is great as a side dish with chicken breast. I  served this with tomato chutney. Added two tablespoons of hot chilies to the recipe.

I liked this recipe, but it took a VERY LONG TIME to cook.  The cook time says 30 minutes, but I think it took at least 45 just for the risotto to soften, and then I added the zucchini.  The taste was nice, but a little bland.  I will make this again, but may spice it up a little more.

Risottos are my favorite dish to make and this one is great.  I hardly used the sun dried tomatoes since I am not a huge fan of them and it was still wonderful.  I also used half vegetable stock and half chicken, worked out well.  Will definitely make again

First time cooking risotto. It was okay, but don't think it will become a family favorite. A lot of work for the equivalent of less labor intensive cooked rice.

This was a great recipe!! My husband and /i both loved it.  I followed it very closely, with my only change being adding extra zucchini and adding 1 cup chianti (I was serving it with veal that was cooking in chianti)  And after we ate it, I realized that I completely forgot to add the thyme.  I will definately use this recipe again!

I think the recipe skimps on instructions for exact risotto preparation.  This was my first attempt at risotto and it came out a little chewy, a little crunchy.  It was really salty!  But it wasn't altogether too bad as an entree.

This recipe was a pleasant surprise-- it was relatively easy to make and turned out firm, tasty, and creamy. We made it vegetarian by substituting the chicken broth with kosher "chicken flavored" soup mix powder which is almost always entirely vegan (look for the word PARVE next to the kosher sign..) The prep time was a bit underestimated (it took us about an hour to make) and I think thicker slices of zuccini would give it a more interesting texture.

I made this by the recipe first time, but  then made it so much better. I added 2 small zucchini, 2 small yellow squash, a can of chick peas and a cup of edamame, a hand full of spinach, and some fresh tomatoes with the jarred sundried tomatoes, I once had no Arborio and used a box mix of quick cheese risotto and omg! We love our Veggie risotto version, so good and we always like to make it with seared scallops placed on top then covered in fresh parmesan. It's so so good ! Sometimes if we have it we use some white wine with the broth too.

If you make this use Better Than Bouillon Chicken broth paste.  I add about a teaspoon per cup of liquid.  It turns out great every time.  This is where much of the flavor is.  If you use a watered down broth it is not as good.  Also, use real butter not margarine.  It is best cooked while stirring in the liquid little by little or a cup at a time because this allows the flavors to develop.  I love sun dried tomatoes.  The more the merrier.  Also, sprinkle a little lemon juice on the finished risotto to brighten up the dish as well as ground black pepper.

So this was my first of many risotto’s I will fix in my life. I had to do a couple things different (due to lack of certain ingredients). I used steamed California blend veggies in place of zucchini and spinach and dry basil in place of fresh basil I also used the chicken stock after it boiled to soften and reconstitute the sun dried tomatoes. I finished the dish by adding cooked chicken breast tenders. Everything else I followed spot on.

I made this, and the only adjustment I made was to halve the recipe. This was simple to prepare and I thought it was delicious! Hearty and filling, and the sun dried tomato really gives this a zing. Unfortunately my husband and neither of my sons cared for it, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.

I baked 1 zucchini, 1 Bell P, 1/2 bundle asparagus and 1/2 cauliflower in oven with little olive oil, salt & pepper then added to my risotto at the end along with the sun dried tom and Parmesan cheese. Came out wonderful but will leave the Thyme out next time as its too overpowering for my taste. Also added garlic to my risotto and stirred the entire time ~20 min.

Risotto is generally labour intensive to make, there's no getting around that. However, for my first try in years making risotto, this turned out wonderfully. I didn't change anything this time, but for next time, it might be nice with some hot sauce or chilli oil to give it more of a kick.

This was a great twist on regular risotto. Not complicated at all, and made it more of a summer dish instead of a heavy winter dish. I did have to add salt towards the end, the parmesean wouldn't have been enough saltiness to get the flavor right. Definite keeper!

Was good! Served over a bed of spinach and a side of oven roasted chicken. Would have liked to add more garlic salt and more sun dried tomatoes for flavor.

We love risotto and this was quite good and very healthy. I added more zucchini and sundried tomatoes. Used the spiralizer on the zucchini. Used dried basil since I didn't have fresh but in sure fresh would be better. Can't wait to make this in the summer with garden fresh ingredients. I always make risotto on a Sunday due to time intensive nature and make enough for 2 or 3 meals as leftovers. It also freezes well.

My first time making risotto.  I will do it again!  I subbed 1/2 c. wine for the broth.   Sauteed the zucchini first and then set it aside until the last 5 minutes or so.  Also used more zucchini than listed.  Keep the broth hot on the stove and added it a ladle-full at a time.

Very good!! This is a great recipe. I've made it with the ingredients listed, and I've also changed it up with different veggies and even added bacon and chopped walnuts. Any combination is excellent!

My family really liked this, I LOVED it!  I added a carrot shredded with a peeler, like the zucchini. I added the carrot and sun dried tomatoes when the rice had just a little crunch left. Then added the zucchini,cheese and basil once it got creamier looking. I will be making this again!

Risotto is a labor intensive dish, so don't make it if you want something quick. But if you're willing to invest the time, this is easy to do, just time consuming. And if you love risotto like I do, worth it.

We've made this many, many times, and have taken it to countless get togethers, and hear nothing but compliments.  Don't get hung up on the quantities or what's added, as much as you do the technique of making risotto.  Bring the broth to a boil and then simmer in one pot.  Caramelize the onions slightly and saute some freshly sliced garlic.  Add the rice to brown it, and then cook as directed.  I've added matchstick carrots, diced bell peppers, zucchini, summer squash, roma tomatoes, and other veggies...whatever was fresh in the garden, or at the store during the winter.

This was ok.  I prefer a more traditional risotto made with more butter and wine.  I found the thyme flavor to be overpowering.  Really the only saving grace for this recipe was the sun-dried tomatoes, they added great flavor.

This was my first time making risotto, and I was a little nervous about adding the liquid at the right time to get the right consistency, but this recipe went smoothly, and the risotto was creamy and flavorful.  I love the addition of the zucchini, but I don't care for the sun-dried tomatoes (I don't really like tomatoes), so I think that I would add a different veggie next time.

I made this recipe this evening, and it turned out very well.  Based on the other reviews, I did change just a couple of things.  I doubled the recipe and wound up with way too much liquid.  Fortunately, I did not add it all to the rice, so the dish turned out well.   Not sure what happened with the liquid though.  I also quadrupled the amount of zucchini, and I believe it was just about right.  Also added some red pepper flakes for just a little bit of heat.  Next time I will also increase the amount of sundried tomatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

My first attempt at risotto and was easier than I thought.  I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed some carrots and a little garlic with the onion.  Also added the thyme and some of the basil when sauteing.  We've been trying to transition to more meatless meals and this one is great for those of us who may be more accustomed to meat at dinner since it has a hearty flavor and is very filling.

This was my first time making a risotto from a recipe and it was very easy to follow. I however did not use the thyme or basil and used a low fat colby cheese and just a small amount and it turned out good, just not real cheesey. Also I lined the bowl with baby spinach leaves and stirred a few through the risotto, they are nice because they wilt and add extra greens. Also I used 7 sundried tomatoes but next time would use the 10 it says as they were not over-powering like I thought they may be. This is a dish in-itself and you don't need lots of extras to go with it.

This was really good. I did add more zucchini and I used chicken broth instead of stock. Other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe.It turned out creamy and very tasty. This would be a recipe worthy of entertaining with. For those that can't seem to get their risotto soft, just be patient and keep cooking (it usually takes about a half hour of stirring and slowly adding broth) . You may need more broth than the recipe calls for. It will get there, I promise!

This was a great dish to make.  It was simple and easy to make (my first time with risotto).  Even though it was good, my husband says that it wasn't "amazing".  I will probably make this or some sort of variation on it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Lovely risotto recipe. Anyone who has been intimidated to make risotto in the past because of how labor-intensive it is would find that it's as simple as can be with a pressure cooker (no stirring required and a FRACTION of the time). The only change to this recipe would be to save out the zucchini, tomatoes and parm and cook everything else at high pressure for five minutes, then stir in the remaining ingredients and simmer until zucchini is tender, only a couple of minutes because it's shaved. It tastes wonderful, and I cook a different risotto every week ever since discovering this fast and easy method.

This is the only risotto recipe I have tried and I love it!! I add sliced baby portabella mushrooms to it and always use two whole zucchini to give it more substance. I also add broccoli on occasion. This time I added about a teaspoon of Ponzu sauce and it added phenomenal flavor. I make this at least once a month!

This was my first time making risotto and it turned out awsome. I did however only use 6 cups of broth instead of the 7. I will be making this again. My husband loved it!

This was one of the best risotto's I've had (and made!).  Fresh basil & parm are a must for this recipe!!  I bbq'd some turkey as well to add to the rice and ate it as a meal.  It was surprisingly good the next day as leftovers, not too dry which can often happen with risotto.

Followed the recipe exactly, minus the sun dried tomatoes.  It tasted so bad that neither my wife or I could eat more than one bite.  The thyme was way too overpowering.

This was delicious!  I did add some cooked diced chicken breast, but it would be good either way.  I am excited to have another dish that can use veggies from the garden and can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch!

really good - it gets my hubby to eat zucchini, which he doesn't care for, plus my picky toddler likes it, and it's a one-pot meal.  I do add quite a bit extra zucchini (3 or 4 times that listed int he recipe), and I dice it rather than shredding it.  I also add a few extra SD tomatoes.

This recipe didn't wow me.  I scaled it down for two and used it as a side dish (sans zucchini because boy doesn't like).  The rice cooked well and was flavorful, but the combination of ingredients struck me as odd.  The sun-dried tomatoes, normally a fave of mine, seemed off.  This recipe is lacking in "oomph" factor...but I can't quite place my finger on what, exactly.

I found this recipe quite bland and had to add some salt.  Recipe would probably taste better if it was eaten as a side course alongside something more savory.  If eaten alone, this is probably pretty healthy, although not very flavorful.

This was very good, but a little bland.  I added sage, peas and brocolli but next time will experiment further to add a bit of flavor.  Needs a little work, but definite potential here!!

Really good- but needed salt.  I added sea salt and also extra parmesian cheese.  I used a regular diced tomato rather than sun-dried.  It was so easy, and I know I'll make it again.  I could so easily sub other veggies or maybe even add some white wine next time.

Very good,I love Risotto and never thought to add sun dried tomatoes but it gives it depth.I only changed it by using half butter and EVOO.Also garlic powder.

This was my first attempt at making risotto that didn't come out of a box, and it turned out pretty good. I had no problems keeping it from getting lumpy, but I found the flavor leaving a little something to be desired. I will probably make this again, but I'll play with it a little more if I do.

My daughter pronounced this the best risotto I've made. I used vegetable stock and left out the parm as she prefers her risottos without. Definite make again. Thanks.

This recipe was too much work for such a bland taste.  I am not yet convinced that zucchini can taste good in anything but bread.  The best part was the sundried tomatoes

Very yummy, and fancy enough to serve to guests.  I think it would go great with a roasted or baked chicken and a green vegetable.  My husband (who won't touch anything with the word "tomato" in it) actually asked for the leftovers to be put in his lunch.  Pretty good sign. :)

This was my first time making risotto. I've never even tasted risotto before so I really didn't know what to expect. It was time consuming to make, so I wouldn't recommend this to the busy person. I really enjoyed it, but I like about everything! My husband didn't have much to say about it, so I wouldn't it will be a favorite. I think I added the zucchini and tomatoes a little too early, cause they weren't crunchy.  I also added bacon when I added the onion.  Overall it was good to me.

My vegetarian husband thought this was ok (very picky, but OK is a good sign). Mine turned out a little dry and pasty. Could use a little something extra.
