Excellent recipe! I followed it exactly even though I was skeptical about leaving out a mixture of dough containing eggs out overnight, but I was determined to have these come out perfectly. Boy were these ever good and so easy too! The dough was easy to roll out (used wax paper lightly floured) and I cut it with a pizza cutter to get nice little triangles. I baked these on parchment paper and they came out nice and fluffy with a slight sweetness. My husband and niece just loved them and quite frankly I did too! Plus the leftovers are great for breakfast with butter and jelly....

I put all ingredients in my bread machine and set it on the dough cycle; followed the directions from there and ended up with terrific rolls.  I had a bit of trouble making them all look the same.  My husband loved'em!

Light, fluffy, easy, delicious ~ and YUMMY! Couldn't ask for an easier recipe.  You can cook them immediately, but I prefer to let them sit overnight as the recipe calls.  They seem to come out fluffier.  (not to mention the smell of fresh bread dough is simply wonderful on a cool fall morning!!)

I have this exact same recipe from one of my Gooseberry Patch cookbooks (Make-Ahead Dinner Rolls), and it says to prepare the dough, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.  I have made these many, many times to my family's delight.  I never made rolls from scratch before, but these couldn't be easier to prepare.  The dough is very easy to work with.  You must try this recipe!

When you need to save some time in a busy day, being able to prepare the dough ahead is a real help.  The rolls are really nice and light, draw lots of raves and requests to serve them again.

I baked these for Thanksgiving and everyone including myself loved them.  They were light and very tasty, slighty sweet and buttery.
I've been baking for about 35 years and am suprised at the negative reviews given.  I have never made rolls that were as easy and that tasted as good.  Thanks for the Recipe!

These are the best!  They are easy to make and can be timed to be baking while everyone is comming to the table, and thus you have piping hot rolls with dinner.  Some of my family eat these instead of dessert with coffee.  I have also used this dought to make cinnamon rolls.  Cut the dough in half and roll each half into a 12"X9" rectangle,sprinkle the dough liberally with cinnamon sugar, and pecans and raisins if desired, Drizzle with 3 tablespoons of melted butter. Roll up, as for a jelly roll, and cut into 1" pieces, using thread works well for this.  Place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet, cover and set on the counter overnight to rise.  Whoever gets up to make the coffee pops them into the oven! Bake as directed in the original recipe. Oh it's so good!

Like most bread, these were great just out of the oven with butter, but once they cooled, I felt they lacked flavor and were a little heavy.

I made these rolls last year for my first holiday with the future in-laws. They were a BIG success, not one left! Very easy to make, and delicious! I brushed mine with melted butter and a sprinkle of garlic powder on top while baking for a little extra flavor.

VERY GOOD!.  Ever so slightly sweet, yet great with meat and potatoes!  Made for Easter dinner and they were a hit.  Make sure warm milk is not too hot to avoid killing the yeast and preventing it from rising.  I had to use very little flour to roll out and cut the dough into wedges with a pizza cutter.  I let them set for a few hours while at church-may want to wait until after church to roll out because they almost over rose.

Excellent!  Also makes very nice brown and serve rolls.  Just bake them until very lightly browned and refrigerate or freeze them.

My family all thought these were great and so easy to make.  I just made mine in the morning. It doesn't really matter if you make them a couple of hours before you need them or several.  Good both ways.  Most breads taste best out of the oven so I just plan it that way.  I think if people don't follow the directions exactly if where the problems come from.  Thanks.

Taste great and are so convenient. I prepared the dough in the morning and was able to have fresh baked rolls with my slow cooker chili that evening!! I halved the recipe and got 6 good size rolls with a thick and fluffy texture. **Update** I made these for Thanksgiving and everybody loved them!! I mixed them the morning before, shaped and prebaked them for 20 mins @ 275 that same night and then when we arrived the next evening cooked them for 8-10 mins @ 400.

This recipe was wonderful.  I made these for thanksgiving and my family loved them.  I also made these with beer instead of milk and let them sit overnight.  They were even better.  The flavor was similar to Grandy's restaurant.

They were horrible! I followed the recipe to a T, and when they came out - the rolls were dry, tasted sour, and the sugar didn't make it taste right at all. It needs more butter, less sugar. Pillsbury dough tastes better than this. I was very disappointed.

Holy moly, these were good!  I stumbled upon this recipe this afternoon, thought it looked easy, and gave it a try.  I had to halve it because I didn't have enough flour and they only got to rise for about 3 hours.  I was making a pot roast though so I put the bowl on top of the stove and the dough rose just fine.  I had to mix in a little more flour (about 1/4 cup) at the end, but after that the dough was perfect to work with.  I brushed them with melted butter (you only need about a tablespoon for half a batch), baked them at 350 for about 18 minutes because I saw that they looked rather overdone in the pictures, and they were divine!  Just a touch of golden brown, a little flaky, and a wonderful rich flavor with just a hint of sweetness.  I'm so glad to have found this easy recipe and will make them repeatedly.  Oh and for those whose rolls were too sour or yeasty tasting, I think you're letting the dough sit out too long.  Try again but don't leave it as long.  Thanks for the recipe!

These rolls are SO easy and delicious!  I've made them a few times now, and here's the key to making them perfect: let them rise overnight, roll them out and into their individual rolls (I prefer to make them round), and let them rise again for at least a couple of hours.  The dense roll is still tasty, but after it's risen the 2nd time, it creates a fluffier texture.  This one is DEFINITELY a keeper!

This was my first time making "from scratch" rolls. I really enjoyed them, and so did my guest. Had strong yeast smell, don't know if that is normal. One of the kids said "Mom, what is that smell?" and the mom said "That's the smell of homemade bread". So I guess it is normal. I didn't have wax paper, just used plastic wrap, and it was ok.

I use my bread machine to knead the dough, then I put in plastic box for couple hours (couldn't wait until the next day).  Finally I shape them into dinner rolls and bake.  These rolls came out soft, moist and very tasty, just the way I like it.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

and reheat in the microwave. Absolutely

Loved it.  My first yeast bread success, and everyone thought they tasted like old-fashioned rolls they remember from childhood.  The person who recommended not letting the milk get too hot so the yeast will foam as it should gave me a good tip, because since the yeast foamed up for me, I knew it was right.  Thanks!

This is the most convient roll recipe I have ever used.  I put everything  into my bread machine and let it rise overnight in a large container.  It made easy, good, old fashioned American light dinner rolls with a buttery, pleasant taste.  The dough smelled very sour in the morning, but it baked up nicely and the sour smell dissapated right away and the taste was just right.

I followed the recipe exactly and in the morning when I uncovered the dough, it looked to be a big gooey mess.  I plunged in, nonetheless, and with a little flour on my hands and table I found the dough to be a PLEASURE to work with...very soft and pliant.  The rolls rose nicely and looked beautiful right out of the oven.  The only problem...they just didn't taste all that great.  So despite the 5*'s I'd give for easiness, I'll have to pass on making this one again.  Thanks for sharing!  UPDATED REVIEW:  Gave these another chance and I have to say that I enjoyed them a lot more this time.   Still super easy to mix and shape...brushed with melted better and rolled like crescents.  Used bread flour this time, so maybe that was the difference.  Also, they browned a little more on bottom than I normally like (due to the dark cookie sheet I used) but they didn't taste overcooked or burned.  Very forgiving!

My grandmother made these rolls every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas, I was SO HAPPY when I found the recipe as she always made them from memory.  They were always the family favorite and I have inherited the task of preparing them.  I add a little more sugar, scant 3/4cup - everyone raves.

These were really good.  I was also aprehensive about leaving the dough out overnight with eggs in it.  The dough was really easy to work with and the rolls were good tasting with a bit of a yeast or sour taste.  Everyone liked these.  I will make these again.

Hate to have to give such a lousy rating, but got to be honest. (I make bread about 2-3 times a week so its not like I don't know how to make it) It turned out very fermented,dense, and yeasty tasting! I'm giving this recipe 2 stars cause my mother-in-law liked them, but no one else in the family said anything.

Excellent and fairly easy recipe for fresh, warm dinner rolls.  A big tip: when rolling out the dough, roll it on a floured surface and dust the rolling pin with flour; otherwise you may have a sticky mess!  Also, I had everyone at the table by the time the first pan came out of the oven, and put the second pan of 12 in the oven at that time so when everyone was ready for seconds, they were right hot from the oven.  Also, I reduced the temperature to 325 so they would not brown quite as quickly.  Instead of putting on greased baking pans, I put the crescent-shaped rolls on brown parchment paper lined pans.

Made this again  (horrible results the first time) and it turned out much, much better.  However, the instructions say absolutely nothing about kneading the dough.  
so I made 2 batches.  kneaded and unkneaded.  will let you know how it went.

It sounds like a great recipe, but I'm afraid to try it because every bread machine manual & cookbook I've read says not to let eggs or other ingredients that may spoil, like milk, to set out overnight.  I cook for small children & the elderly & am afraid to chance it.

Imade these for Thanksgiving-1999.  They were a big hit!!  Ilike this recipe because there isn't much kneading, I love homemade bread, but my wrists don't like to knead dough.

These were wonderful. I used my bread machine to mix the dough and then wrapped the dough up and put it in the fridge overnight. The next morning, I took the dough out and left it covered with a towel to warm to room tempature before I divided the dough and baked them. I will make these again.

Excellent rolls. I've also made braided this bread with great success. To braid:  Once it's risen, punch down and turn onto a well floured surface, especially since this is a very sticky dough. Divide int0 3 equal sections to braid, or 2 sections to make a twist. I like to brush this bread with melted butter (versus egg white or eggs) before and after baking, which adds a lot of flavor and a nice golden color. This is so easy to make, we eat it about once a week. You can also mix this in the morning and by dinner time, it would have nicely risen.  A great fail-safe recipe for beginner bakers too.

I made these yesterday for Easter dinner.  I made the dough very early in the morning and shaped the rolls in the early afternoon.  The dough is very easy to work with and is not at all sticky.  I used a pizza cutter to make it easy to cut the dough.  I liked the shape and appearance of the rolls.  The outside had a little crunch and the inside was soft but not mushy. I did think they were a little too sweet and might cut down on the sugar next time.

Good, but nothing special. I'd recommend using pastuerized eggs if you have "raw egg" issues. Everyone thought these were just your garden variety dinner rolls. I probably wouldn't make them again because of how long they take when I can get a similar roll in less time.

I was initially turned off by all the butter and sugar. So I changed it to 1/4 cup light olive oil and 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup sugar. I also did not wait overnight for the rise. The result? My family LOVED it. It has gone faster than some desserts.

Really good. I don't follow the overnight instructions. I give them about 4-5 hours instead and they still turn out PERFECT. The dough is easy to work with. I've made them several times this way with the same results.

These were easy and very tasty.  I brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled some with coarse sea salt, some with sesame seeds, and some with parmesan.  They all came out really well.  I think I may try these as cinnamon rolls since they can be made overnight.

How easy it was to get compliments with these!  Love that they do not take up room in the fridge as most overnight rolls do.  As suggested by many others, used 2 teaspoons of yeast and made sure the milk was 100 degrees when adding to yeast and sugar.  Mixed together with dough hook.  The next day, rolled out large rolls with buttered hands and placed in Pam-ed muffin cups.  Covered and allowed to rise at least an hour.  Everyone loved these.

Not the best rolls I've ever made, but they are so easy it makes up for the loss in flavor.  It makes A+ cinnamon rolls - just beat one stick softened butter with brown sugar and cinnamon, roll out the dough, and spread the thick cinnamon-butter-sugar mixture over it.  Roll up from the narrow side and cut nice fat cinnamon rolls to bake - they are great alone or with cream cheese frosting.  Yum! I always get asked for the recipe when I make those.

These are wonderful. My only changes were that I used a little less butter, bread flour, and made them into traditional roll shapes (balls) rather than rolling out. Also, after proofing the yeast, I put everything in the breadmaker-dough cycle- and let it do the work. I only let them raise for about an hour more than the cycle. I have made quite a few roll recipes from this site (my little boy loves rolls), and this is by far the best. I will definitely make these again, only next time with just a little less sugar. Thank you for the recipe!
UPDATE: I have changed my rating to a 4. Last night I decided to make these rolls and let them rise overnight as directed, and I am not impressed. Like many others said, too yeasty. I will continue to make this recipe but definitely without the overnight rise.

I follow this recipe exactly and in the morning eagerly went to see the result but I was very disapointed as for the whole night the dough only rise a bit so I let it sit near my hot oven and it did rise but the taste was quite sour I think due to the fermenting of the yeast. Nobody want to eat it.

I have never left bread to raise overnight.  This was a disaster!!!  I ended up with beautiful rolls that had an over-powering smell of yeast.  Had to throw them all out.

Great recipe! Because there is no kneading involved it might be the best recipe for the new to yeast cook. They look lovely and taste good. Give it a try!

These are great. I made them the morning of Thanksgiving for a small group and hardly any are left (they'll make for good leftover sandwiches, they were that big!)

I had problems proofing the yeast in the milk, though. I had to throw out my yeast the first two times, as the recipe didn't really say how warm for the milk to be. I also lost my thermometer to gauge its temperature, so that was a waste of some yeast and sugar. What I ended up doing was taking hot water from the faucet (about half a cup) and combined it with about half a tablespoon of yeast, and a third of the sugar in the recipe. I had a warmed oven turned off, and let it sit in there for about 35 minutes. 

Once it proofed and got bubbly, I added in all the remaining ingredients. More flour is a definite need if you want to roll it out between wax sheets, so it won't stick. I let it rise for about 5 hours, then rolled them out, cut them up and let them rise another hour on the sheets. I melted about a quarter cup of butter to brush on the rolls, and cooked them for around 11 minutes. They came out really fluffy and soft and delicious!

Eh. There were almost good. The texture was amazing. The taste left something to be desired. I will try them again, one more time. After reading the other reviews, I may try to shape them sooner than I did. Ended up with a bit of a sour taste.

I thought these were wonderful!! Very easy. I used instant yeast and added it to the flour mixture, I skipped the yeast softening step by doing this. I also let them proof in the oven for a half hour before baking. Very pretty little bun to add to any dinner menu!! Thanks Pam

I followed the recipe as exactly as I could, left them in a nice warm place to rise overnight (in my oven, off, with the pilot light on, which has worked for every other dough I've left in there) and I got buttery hockey pucks. 

They did not rise one bit. In the morning, I saw the dough hadn't really risen, I figured I might as well try it and perhaps it would rise in the oven. Nope. They puddled outward a bit, but that's all.

I gave an extra star because the flavor was fine - buttery and bready. They probably would have been delicious had they risen at all. I can't in good conscience give any more though, considering I make bread all the time and haven't had a flop like this since I first started years ago and used old, dead yeast that had been in my mother's kitchen for no one knows how long. My yeast is not dead now, the same jar worked just fine yesterday, so there's no excuse.

I love homemade bread/rolls so I had to try this particular recipe due to the ease of the process.  They turned out great with no problems but do agree with many of the other reviewers that it lacks in taste.  It needs to be tweaked but not sure how at this point and time.

I wanted to give these a five stars, but there were some things not noted in the directions that really disappointed me. I've noticed that reviewers have pointed out to not make the milk too hot (as it will kill the yeast), but one thing not really mentioned was to not make the milk too cold either (about 100 degrees F). The second thing I'd like to point out is to still add salt, though you could cut back a little, when using salted butter. I found that all the sugar in the rolls really cover up the salt in the butter-- either that or you can cut back on the sugar. The third thing is when the recipe calls for .25oz of yeast, it means 2 1/4 teaspoons. I must agree with others that they were only good when fresh. The flavour was great, the flaw was the rising of the yeast. You must let it really proof, and when I say proof, I mean really proof. Let the yeast start foaming. That's one of the biggest problems when making bread. I probably won't try this again, but for others who plan on giving this a shot, hope this helps a bit.

The little dough boy just stopped giggling!  He's going to go out of business because these are what Pillsbury crescent rolls aspire to be.  These are so easy (no kneading, yes!), I couldn't believe how good they turned out.  Next time I will roll in a little cream cheese and jam, or maybe cocktail wieners and cheese!

Great right out of the oven. A little heavy after cooling but still a great flavor. It's fantastic to be able to prepare the dough the night before. I split the dough in half, made twelve rolls with one half and with the other half, i made a small loaf of bread that i just shaped and cooked on a baking sheet. Oh, i added 1 1/2 teas. salt as i find most bread recipes are better with a little extra salt.

This is an excellent recipe that took me a few times to perfect. Measure carefully. Instead of 1 pkg yeast, I put in 2 level tsp. yeast as I thought the rolls tasted a bit yeasty. Heat the milk to about 100 F. I also add 1 tsp. vinegar to the bowl when I do step 2.  Spoon the flour gently into measuring cup-do not pour or scoop or shake down. Next morning, I pat (not roll) the dough to about 3/4 inches and cut with 2 inch cookie cutter. Then you must let rise covered, in warm place until double. In my oven, I have to bake for 15 min. at 375 F. I make 2 recipes in separate bowls, as while you are making them, you may as well make lots. I freeze one batch. They are wonderful and light and very tasty. Thanks for the recipe Pam.

Simple, easy & the prefect dinner roll!!! The hardest part... as with any recipe containing yeast, making sure you don't kill the yeast - which I have done several times.  My best (and simple) recommendation is have a thermometer and follow the temperature guide on the yeast package.

I dipped the rolls in butter before baking them, but I might try brushing on a little egg next time as they are baking.  My domestic partner loved them!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have many roll recipes that I love but this one was so unusual I wanted to try it. After reading previous reviews which seem to be a combination of love or hate these rolls, I wasn't sure what to expect. They came out light and airy with a heavy yeast taste for me..which we loved. The dough was a joy to work with and the rolls turned out beautiful. I made 16 large crecent rolls and I think this dough would make fabulous cloverleaf rolls which I plan to try next time.

I made these for a pot luck.  I liked the fact that I didn't have to knead them.  Instead of making them into cresents though, I shaped them into regular dinner rolls. They rose for about an hour then and they turned out beautiful.  I got 16 rolls from the recipe.  The texture was really nice considering there was no kneading.  Thanks

I just made a half batch of these for the first time, and they turned out great. I started the dough and had it to the "rising" stage by 8 AM, formed the rolls after seven hours, then let them rest for an hour before baking to have fresh rolls for dinner. They are very good as is, but I think I'll add some Italian seasoning and/or garlic salt the next time I make them, as there is definitely some room for tweaking depending upon when you want to serve them. I'm interested to see how they hold up after they've had a chance to cool off. I can definitely see how, if serving to a crowd, one would likely not ever get the chance to find out. Fresh out of the oven, they are pretty irresistible. One caveat, tho...I'd be leery of making this dough in our hotter climate of the summer months. I think if I make these during the summer, I'll either not let the dough sit as long before baking, or I'll do a longer, slower rise in the fridge. I peeked at the dough after three hours, and the rise at seven hours didn't seem to be much greater, so maybe the longer rise isn't crucial for success.

These rolls became the absolute favorite for our family get togethers about 3 years ago.  I use vanilla soy milk and a dairy free margerine as we have dairy issues in our family, and they still taste amazing!

The rolls did rise good overnight. It was an easy recipe because there was no kneading and really not a whole lot of work. The texture was good they were big & fluffy. . All you could smell or taste was yeast! I guess letting it sit overnight made the milk and eggs sour. I thought adding the butter to the yeast mixture would give it a nice buttery taste but I was wrong you could not taste the butter at all. Maybe if you topped the rolls with butter after baking in the oven it might make it taste a little better.We didn't care for them at all and I never plan on using this recipe again.

OMGoodnes! These are phenomenal! Only thing I did different was make the dough in my bread machine, I also added 4 tsps vital gluten since I used all purpose flour.  I cut the dough into 20 pieces and rolled into balls, placed the dough in greased muffin tins and let rise, covered for 1 hour.  Brushed with butter before baking for 20 minutes at 350 degrees and brushed again when I removed from the oven. I just devoured 3 with apricot jam, I think I found my recipe!

I don't know why this recipe would get bad reviews--the people who said they were dense, too yeasty, etc. must have done something wrong.  These rolls are GREAT!  Super easy, had everything on hand, and I will DEFINITELY make them again and again.  I've been looking for a recipe that makes soft, yeasty rolls, and this is it.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'm adding this one to my book!

They looked good, they were easy to make, but they had NO TASTE.  I did not change the recipe at all, they rose beautifully, I even liked the yeast smell my kitchen had in the morning, but they are completely flavorless.  I think this would be a great base for a cinnamon roll recipe, but they just are not good by themselves.

Very tasty and tender. I think I will try slathering the dough w/ a little butter before rolling into crescents. But they are good without the butter.

These are as easy to make as they are delicious! I have made them twice with excellent results and I think they will become a staple at our holiday dinners.  My only problem is that they are a little sweet for my taste. Some people loved the sweetness, but I am going to try cutting the sugar in half next time I make them.

Followed this recipe almost to a T (only thing I did differently was..I couldnt find my rolling pin...so I had to roll them into traditional rolls).  I'm sure this is the reason why it had an almost biscut like texture and wasnt fluffy.  They were still good though and the family almost polished all of them off at Thanksgiving.  Will make again and roll them into the traditional Butterhorn shape (which is what this recipe is..Butterhorn rolls!)  :)

These turned out very soft and nice, but they were a little sour.  I ended up letting the dough rise for 24 hours, which was too long.  Next time, I think I will make and bake them the same day.

This was absolutely THE BEST and easiest recipe for yeast rolls that I have ever made! Super easy to put together; I left them on the counter for at least 15-16 hours. Made two very light and puffy balls, rolled out the dough and made the crescents. Let them sit for an hour or so and baked. SUPER light and flavorful!!! I am going to make another batch for our Thanksgiving dinner on Sunday!!!

These were super simple to make.  I loved the cosistency of the dough and ease of preparation.  My family loved them, but like other reviewers, I personally thought there was something missing in the taste as compared with normal homemade dinner roll recipes.  I plan to try it again with margarine, as I don't usually use butter for baking and didn't know if that was why I didn't care for the flavor.  The other option might be to add more salt, but I think that might affect the rising of the dough.

My son and I made these for Thanksgiving this year and they were a big hit. Turned out light and a tiny bit sweet. My son is 10 and he did all the rolling and used a pizza cutter to cut. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe several times for Thanksgiving and it comes out perfectly if you follow the directions. It's easy and bakes up quickly, you can trust this one to be a big hit. The leftover rolls, if there are any, are great filled with turkey salad. Another great way to use up those turkey leftovers.

I used my Kitchen Aid to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the sugar and warm milk for ten minutes, then I added the eggs, butter, then the dry ingredients. I kneaded this dough with my dough hook for about five minutes (I did have to add more flour to get it into a ball and be able to be kneaded with the hook). I set it to rise for an hour in a large greased bowl covered with a tea towel on a warm heating pad for an hour. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to make uniform rolls and rolled them on the counter to make better shaped rolls. I drizzled 1/4 teaspoon of oil over the top of each roll before wrapping it with saran wrap and letting it rise on the warm heating pad for another 45 minutes. I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. Very, very yummy. BAKERY quality and unbelievably easy. HUGE hit with the family.

I have made tons of rolls and these are absolutely the best! They make a really nice presentation if you stir up an egg and coat the top of the rolls with it just before they go in the oven. I add just a pinch of sugar to the egg and then paint on, for a little extra sweetness. Thanks for sharing Pam!

Tastes great! HELP for cold, wet climates to rescue unrising dough: activate a new mixture of yeast, sugar, water per yeast's instructions. Once frothy and ready, begin mixing in old dough...first a golf ball sized lump, one by one, until 1/2 your dough is incorporated. Then add remainder of dough until mixed together, knead, cover and let rise. If you have a slightly warm oven, close and let rise in there. Keep covered with wax paper or plastic wrap in lightly oiled bowl to keep moist and easy to release.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I apparently didn't do it right, lol. First time "roll" baker, haha. I'm not sure what I did wrong or where I went wrong but the TASTE of this recipe was awesome, even though I pretty much made biscuits instead of rolls. Try, try again right? I think it was ME heating it too hot, actually. Great recipe though!!

This is my family's favorite yeast roll.  This year for the holidays, we made a double recipe in the morning.  The turned out perfect as always.  Don't let them rise too much or they are too "airy".  Bake in a dark pan for a golden crust.  Yeasty and delicous!  Never leftovers.

My favorite rolls!  I've been using this recipe for two years for all special occasion dinners...  the only time these did not turn out was when I didn't get the milk warm enough for the yeast.

I put the bread batter together last night and put a towel over it.  When I got ready to make loaves there was a crust over the batter and I "almost" threw it out but, I figured I would try it and if it didn't turn out good then I would toss it and let it go at that.
I made the rolls and they are the BEST I have made!!  The texture was so light and the taste of the rolls were delicious! There was no kneading of the batter, just to make the rolls. This is a favorite of mine now and I will make more of these delicious rolls for my family.
Thank you for sharing!

These are delicious!! I put it all in the bread machine on dough cycle and when done I took it out, rolled it , cut it and formed the rolls. Placed it on the baking sheet and baked.Very quick and easy!!   No waiting overnight here they were perfect. Nice easy dough to work with too. Just used a little flour for the rolling.  Thanks so much!!

Mmmmm...  These rolls are so yummy!! I made them for my first Thanksgiving 3 years ago and have been making them for every holiday since because they are loved and requested!!  I usually brush them with a little bit or margarine before baking them.

Did exactly what the directions said for this recipe. The next morning the dough was still very sticky and smelled VERY yeasty. Maybe because I used the required bread yeast amount for a regular yeast. I baked a few to try it out as is. The rolls were fermently bland-white and tasted a very yeasty. I put some more flour in the dough. Still...the baked rolls turned out the same, but at least it raised a bit in the oven. I was disappointed on the outcome. Again, maybe because I used bread yeast then regular yeast that it asked for.

We made these the night before for Thanksgiving, and they turned out great!  We rolled them like crossiants and made the butter/sugar/cinn. dip (1/2 cup butter, 2Tb bwn sug. and some cinn), and it was one of the only things our guests wanted to eat later that night... the whole batch was finished off, and they were still asking for more!

These were good rolls, but i expected something much better based on all the rave reviews.  I did have to add more flour b/c of all the humidity so maybe that contributed to the texture...

I really liked the simplicity of this recipe. You get the wonderful flavor and texture of homemade bread without all the fuss! I didn't take the trouble to roll it out and cut and shape it, though. I rolled balls of dough between my hands to make rolls. Much easier and much faster and a lot less mess.

I am an avid bread baker.  This is the easiest, best tasting dinner roll I have ever made.  What a great recipe.  There is no kneeding required, so this a gret recipe for those who have never baked any type of bread before.  We have large family dinners at my Dad's house every Sunday....these rolls will be prepared for that dinner from now on.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!!  Give them a try!

It doesn't give me the option of 0 stars so I had to choose 1 star. THe recipe was a waste of money and time. I don't know what everyone is talking about. I might as well pour yeast in my mouth, it was tasted spoiled and the texture is awful!

I had a yeast roll recipe years ago out of one of those "County Cookbooks" comprised of a bunch of homemade recipes. Those rolls were the best ever. Put all the ingredients in a big bowl, stir it until it all comes together. Cover it and let sit overnight on the counter. Next morning, punch the dough down, roll it out, cut pie slices & roll into crescents. Put on a baking sheet & let rise until your ready to bake. I lost that County cookbook years ago and have search for this recipe ever since. THIS IS THE ONE! THIS IS IT! Made these for our Thanksgiving dinner and was not dissapointed! These rolls are so light, so airy, so wonderful, they seem to beg for real creamy butter & honey or preserves! These are fantastic and more! :) I only made one change. I used bread flour (only because I had it). These were heavenly light!

I have only made these once, but I agree with those who said they would taste better with butter brushed on right after baking. Otherwise a very nice dinner roll.

Very good rolls. They do not have a strong taste so will go with many things.  I made three batches for this Thanksgiving. I used my bread machine and they turned out well. I made one batch and baked them that day and I let two batched sit overnight. My family preferred the ones baked that day.  I also increased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  My family enjoyed them very much so we will have them often. Thanks!

Great, easy recipe for rolls-- it has never failed me!  Instead of making them into cresents, I roll the dough into 2 circles and cut each into 8ths, and let the rolls rise as triangles, which is even easier!

I was scared to make it because it because I never made rolls from scratch, but mixing is easy, I had a little trouble rolling the rolls,they were getting stuck to my hand, I let them sit for 10min to rise, and baked them and whola! Everyone loved them, Josephine

My rolls turned out hard and heavy. I think it was the cook and not the recipe because the flavor was great. What I did wrong was I mix it with my Kitchen Aid mixer and I think it mixed it to much. I will make them again and not use the mixer to see if it was the recipe or ME!

I will try again. My yeast couldn't raise the Titanic. Cooked them anyway. Still good but I would expect them to be really fluffy next time. Try, try again.

These were the worst rolls I ever made.  They had a strong yeast flavor and the texture was grainy and cake like.  They looked fantastic, but tasted bad.

I was aprehensive leaving this out overnight with eggs in it.  I read the reviews and nobody mentioned that it was a problem so I tried it and it was great.  Yes, they smell of a strong yeast in the morning but I didn't feel they tasted that way at all.  They were gone before anything else in the meal was.  People asked for more but I was all out of them!  Some people ate 3!  It's worth trying.  I put them in to cook while the turkey was 'resting' and they were ready when the guests sat down and ready to eat.

these couldn't be easier, or better.  I made them for Thanksgiving dinner, and again for Christmas Dinner, 2000.  The leftover rolls are so good the next day with turkey soup (thanksgiving turkey) or split pea soup (christmas ham!)  What a perfect day after a holiday meal.

Big hit on Christmas Eve with my family. Went great with the Beef Tenderloin. This dough was so easy to make! I did not knead it, but was I supposed to? The rolls where very tender and very buttery!

Great and convenient.  Good flavor.  I thought, when I made the dough, that this wouldn't work out.  It wouldn't stick together or smooth out.  However, in the morning, it was a great dough.  The easiest I've ever worked with to roll out.  My kids helped me roll them up.  Definately a keeper!

These rolls turned out wonderfully for me. They reminded my family of the famous Sister Schubert rolls that I have often purchased at the grocery store. It was easy to put the dough together last night, roll them out, and then just let them sit until time to put them into the oven. I didn’t have to worry about them over-rising. This recipe will definitely be added to my list of favorites. Easy and great tasting!

Excellent!!!!!   Easiest roll ever!!   Super sweet and tasty!!!   I made these for Thanksgiving based on the good reviews.  I mixed the dough exactly as directed at around 10:00pm, and rolled the dough out and assembled the rolls exactly as directed around 10:00am.  I did not bake until 11:30am.   They continued to rise on the pan as they rested.   They were huge and light and fluffy.   I will make these often, especially for special occasions!

I liked it.  I reduced the sugar a little and brushed the tops with melted butter before baking.  They were light, tender, tasty and a classic dinner roll.

Got bad result.  I was wishing the bad reviews are wrong but it turned out same to me.  Rolls were very sour and heavy.  I might have killed the yeast at first because I didn't see the difference in the mixture after 30 minutes.  So I added another one to the mix and followed the rest, then left it overnight.  The dough was easy to handle.  They were all right out of the oven but sour taste got worse after half day.

I used a thermometer for my milk and I also used bread machine yeast – because that is all I had. It is 70 degrees here today.  My dough was rising at 8:30am.  I rolled it out at 1:30pm and used half of the dough for butter horn rolls and the second half for cinnamon rolls.  The dough did not smell or taste yeasty to 3 of us. 

I will tell you that it was a dream to work with.  I have a large silicone mat 20 x 30 that I use to roll dough out on.  It requires a minimum amount of extra flour and the mat will not slip making your rolling out job a lot easier. I would not call them a dinner roll…but when warm they are suitable for butter and jam.  

The cinnamon rolls were very easy to make.  I just spread the rolled out rectangle with a stick of softened butter then sprinkled white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  Rolled them up, sliced 1 ½ inches wide and let them rest while the rolls were baking.  After cooling I put a cream cheese frosting on top.

I've used this recipe for many years, and it's always a great success.  Simple to put together, easy to roll out and "voilà!" - light fluffy brioche type rolls.

Super easy to make and convenient when you need a quick bread recipe (my daughter's class was having a soup party today and she was supposed to supply rolls to eat with it).  I put them in the oven then turned it on to preheat so I could get a little rise out of them while the oven was getting up to temperature (I always do this with my cinnamon rolls).  The taste was wonderful, the texture was not.  Perhaps if you made their shapes then let them sit for another couple hours for a rise they would be better?  I might make these again if I'm desperate for something fast and easy, but not for an occasion when I need super yummy food.

These rolls are excellent when served warm but mediocre when served cold.  This recipe definitely made it easier to have fresh baked rolls for Thanksgiving since I could do most of the work the night before.

Loved these!  I really like the fact that most of the work is done the night before.  A quick roll in the morning and then all you have to do is bake when you're ready.  Went very well with our turkey soup.  Lovely, fluffly, light rolls!

These were phenomenal!!!  I made them for Easter for both sides of the family and couldn't get enough wonderful things said about them.  The taste is so close to my Great Grandmothers dinner rolls that she used to make...it was very reminisant.

I made these rolls for Easter.  They were definitely some of the easiest rolls I've made, and they rose very quickly.  I'm giving them four stars because everyone in my family liked them, but I thought they smelled and tasted sour.  Maybe it's just me.

These are the best!  I just make them up like normal rolls and they taste heavenly.  I also put all the ingredients except for the liquid and yeast into ziplocs as my own quick "mix" so I can make these whenever I want.  Thanks so much!

I didn't let these sit out overnight (didn't want to sicken my dinner guests), but maybe that's why I wasn't impressed with the end result. I dunno. The taste was just okay, the dough was very, very sticky. Will not be making again.

YUM!YUM! YUM! The perfect dough to make my pepperoni rolls! I will, however, cut the sugar back to at least 1/4 cup - a bit too sweet for the ppepperoni rolls, but the exact texture and consistancy I was looking for! Thanks!

Nice rolls. I made them with filling of apricot and a little applesauce. Came out great. I liked the idea of overnight rest. Will make those again, Thanks :)

I followed the recipe as stated, but ran into some problems.  First of all, the dough got bigger than expected overnight and busted out of the wax paper onto the counter.  Also, the dough stuck terribly to the wax paper (and counter) and was a pain to remove.  In truth, the bread really didn't taste as good as other rolls I've made.  I would use this recipe again if pushed for time, but would put way more wax paper down and spray it with pam.

Delicious! I have made this dough at least 20 times now for everything from dinner rolls to stromboli to cinnamon rolls to monkey bread. If using for as a sweet dough, it does not need to rise overnight. The yeast flavor becomes a little overwhelming. As a savory application, they don't get any better than this! This is my families new favorite roll, and is requested at all gatherings.

These are good, but I notice that they don't seem to taste very good cold, so if you have leftovers, pop them in the microwave for 15-30 seconds before eating them.

This did not turn out well for me. I am biscuit and roll challenged however.  I will try these again and rerate.  I think I am the problem and not the recipe however.  The taste was great but they were hard.

I had low expectations, especially in the morning.  The dough was a sticky, lumpy mess, but I didn't have a backup plan.  I oiled my hands, rolled the dough into little coils, brushed them with butter, sprinkled with coarse salt, let them rise, slammed 'em in the oven.  Man, oh man, were they good!  The salt and butter really made them though, because they were a good contrast to the sweetness of the roll.  Will definitely make these again and see if lightning strikes twice.

I hate giving bad reviews, especially when there are so many good ones.  Something went wrong for me here, obviously.  We made these for Christmas dinner and they were the only flop.  Everything else was so good and the bread was not!  The dough was sticky and very yeasty smellling.  We went ahead and used it and the resulting rolls were flat and had an odd taste.  Definitely yeasty.  My hubby and mom both said that they tasted like a bad(!) attempt at sourdough.  I don't know what went wrong.

These were great.  I'm a first time roll maker and these turned out perfectly and were really easy.  I added a little extra milk to make the dough hold together better.  I liked the yeasty taste, as did my family, it wasn't too much and that's what makes them taste homemade.

This was a great, easy recipe. I made some dough this morning for dinner, and those rolls were so good, I made two more batches before bed: one for cinnamon rolls in the morning, the other for pigs in blankets for lunch. I took the advice of others and cut the sugar slightly (to a scant 1/3 cup), used only 2 teaspoons of yeast instead of a whole envelope, plus I used a thermometer to make sure the milk was just the right temperature for the yeast. This dough was so easy to make and easy to work with, it will definitely be added to my regular line up. I love the fact that you can make it in advance and NO KNEADING!

These rolls are so great! No kneading required--and you can just let them wait until you're ready to bake them. I have another recipe that I like the taste of better, but when I need something low-maintenance, these are the best!

This recipe has allowed me to easily add homemade rolls to my Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.  The recipe makes a large number (I confess we have had a couple holidays where I have had more than 20 coming so have doubled it!!!)and it is excellent.  Everyone raves and this will always be part of my repetoire.
Thanks for a great holiday staple!

This was an okay roll.  The dough was very easy to work with, although I did have to add a little flour to ease the stickiness. It smelled really, really yeasty, and I got worried, but the flavor was okay. Everyone seemed to like it just fine. Good for first timers!

Not overly impresive. Though it's one of the simpler bread recipes, it's still an hour's worth of work. All that and everyone thought they were store-bought.

Our local bakery recently closed, so I needed to make rolls for Thanksgiving.  I tried these and LOVED them.  They are perfect for holidays as you make them ahead and just pop them in the oven when you need them.   Everyone loved them at our dinner!

Great recipe!  I found this recipe last year and made a double batch for Thanksgiving.  I am making them again this year so the In-Laws don't lynch me!  They loved them and are expecting them again this year.

This was, hands down, the easiest roll recipe I have ever made.  That fact alone makes up for the fact that it wasn't the tastiest roll I have ever eaten.  But... It was still mighty tasty and everyone gobbled them up at my dinner table. I will teach this to a group of Malaysian women who have never baked bread before.  What a great recipe!

These rolls are to die for.  I didn't make them overnight because I never plan that far in advance, I think four hours is plenty of time for the dough to rise.  I also put butter over the top of them right when they come out of the oven and they don't need anything else.  They got snatched right up.

We've made these rolls twice now for family gatherings, and they have gotten numerous compliments.  My husband's side has jokingly hinted that we'll be asked to bring these to every family party now!  The second time I only let them rise for about four hours before I put them into the oven - tasted the same but didn't keep their shape quite as well as the overnight ones.  If you like a yeasty taste, these are good rolls for you.  I gave this four stars instead of five only because anything that requires a rolling pin is too time intensive for me to make regularly.

These rolls are really great.  I also just made them the morning I was going to use them. No yeast taste.  Everyone I have made them for has loved them.  I am a fraternity cook and I will be making them for them, plus I will be making them for a summer camp. Thanks for sharing!
