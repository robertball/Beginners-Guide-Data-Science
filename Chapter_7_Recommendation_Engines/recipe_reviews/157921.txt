I liked these better the first night--we had some leftovers tonight and I really didn't like it warmed up again.  Best when first cooked . . .  Too salty and soyish tasting the second time I guess.  I'd put less tamari in.  I prefer green beans amandine to this recipe, but it's not too bad.  Thanks for the recipe.

Didn't have tamari, so used soy sauce.  It turned out very well, but next time I'll get tamari.

Used two packages of French green beans and added a little olive oil. Perfect with plain white rice.
