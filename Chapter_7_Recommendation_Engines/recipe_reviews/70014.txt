This was indeed very rich. And sweet! I really enjoyd this drink but feel it is best suited as a dessert cocktail. Thanks SB0719!

This was my treat tonight.

Very sweet cocktail. I added just a little half-n-half after tasting it to cut the sweetness. 

This won't be an every night drink but it was very good for an after-dinner treat. imvintage was right when she said it's a dessert cocktail.

Yum! I recommend adding a jigger of vodka and changing the servings to 2. It's a little too sweet as is.

This is wonderful--I like to pour the mix (no ice ) into my coffee. I drink half hot, and "Nurse" the other half poured over ice as Iced Coffee--YUM!

This is an awesome drink...this is what we call a Buttery Nipple when it's served warm in a shot glass. Just mix the schnapps and irish cream, then float the Kahlua on top.
