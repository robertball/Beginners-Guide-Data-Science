Hi I'm Ricardo (Popi1950). 
I wanted to share with people some hints to improve my recipe. The cabbage wedges, you need to remove core and should be broken up into separate leaves. Then scatter them into baking dish. The rest of the assembly is correct. 
Hint regarding my crushed garlic:  I keep it in a jar covered in a good olive oil in the frig. 
Also you NEED to stir it at least once after 15-20mins and adjust seasoning. I find that I have to add water. Oh, Its ok to use garlic power too.  I hope these points improve your dish. 
Enjoy, Ricardo.

Really great recipe.  I was looking for an alternative to coleslaw, and really wanted something warm for winter, this was very flavorful and I loved how simple it was to make.  Definitely make sure to cut the core out as your chopping the cabbage.  I minced the garlic and put it in between the cabbage leaves as best I could and added the optional 1/4 cup of water, it came out moist and garlic not burnt at all.  Loved it.

This was a nice touch to our corned beef.  The flavor was good and it was nice to just put it in the oven and cook it.  Loved the cartelized flavor it got.

Since I am really tryin to keep meat off the table this works out well for me.  Pick a big head of cabbage and quarter it BUT dont core it, if you do it will not hold together.  Also try adding a bit of sugar to the olive oil it will give it the WOW factor.

I liked the cabbage but the garlic burnt pretty fast. Next time I will add it during the second baking period. It dried a little bit and added some water.

This was very good. Next time I would roast the cabbage without the garlic for the first 30 minutes, then add the garlic and finish roasting.  My oven is not reliable so I would roast much longer next time too.

I love this, it has become one of my favorite foods. I wedge or slice the cabbage, stick the garlic between the leaves and on top and drizzle with a little olive oil and roast. The edges may brown a bit, but that’s the best part.

Exceeded expectations. Very important to keep round together, the bits that got loose on mine burned. I made them just under 1/4”, will do full 1/4” next time

This recipe intrigued me so much that I decided to forego the usual colcannon, instead making this and Champ as side dishes with slow-roasted corned beef.  I followed the recipe exactly, layering the cabbage and garlic.  It was delicious but, in spite of roasting an additional 20 minutes, never achieved that golden caramelization that other reviewers posted photos of.   Still head and shoulders above the soggy slow cooker corned Beef and cabbage!

It was our first time to try it.  Nest time will add to the spices.  we liked it and it was different than just plain cabbage.

Super easy and very tasty!  Love the crunchy bits.  My boyfriend likes me to add granulated siriracha to his wedges before cooking and it makes it super spicy!

This was really good. Reminded me of buttered cabbage. The garlic did burn slightly but gave it that little bit of crispiness. I will definitely make this again for company

Perfect for a low carb lunch.  I put in my countertop oven and let it roast while I did some work.  I really like the burnt crunchy ends.

Well, my top layer of cabbage burned so I removed it before taking the picture. Burned as in charred. That might have been my fault though so I am giving this recipe 4 stars based off how the bottom layer turned out. LOVED it and it went great with my corned beef!
