It had too much flax for me. I think it would be better with maybe half almond flour or coconut flour--something like that. Also, adding some banana or blueberries might help. It was a little difficult for me to eat because of the texture. I added some butter and honey, and that helped. I sprayed my mug with oil and mixed everything right in the mug. It cooked perfectly in 60 seconds.
