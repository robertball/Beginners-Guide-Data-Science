This is OK so far as barbeque-esque sauces go but this is NOT Arby's sauce I'm sorry to say. The molasses overwhelms it and mostly I just smell baked bean sauce of some kind. The hot sauce also seems a little excessive--between hot sauce steak sauce Wocestershire and ground pepper be prepared to get a real pepper kick in there. I'm alright with that but again not Arby's sauce. To cut the heavy molasses taste and the sweetness I added more Worcestershire and steak sauce and it ended up an odd sort of BBQ sauce as I said. Totally edible with the pulled brisket I made but not at all what I was expecting.

It was super close but too sweet! So I decreased the molasses to 1 tablespoon and added 1/4 cup of vinegar to add the missing twang to it. It s still not perfect but I m getting closer!
