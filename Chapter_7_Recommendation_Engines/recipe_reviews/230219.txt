We really enjoyed this for something different. I get eggplants in our co op and I have trouble using them as they are not really a favorite of ours. This was quick to prepare and the crunchy topping was great! Smelled lovely as it was cooking and the seasoning was just right. I did not have ground chicken so I used ground pork.....delicious! Hopefully now I will stop letting those eggplants go bad!

Did NOT like the texture at all. Not much flavor either. Will not make again.

Left the cheese sour cream and chicken out for my sister. She really liked it.
