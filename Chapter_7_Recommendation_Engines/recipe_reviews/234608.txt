I did not care for this recipe. It tasted like apple butter cooked down on chicken. No Asian flavor at all.  Very disappointed.

I enjoyed the flavor of this, and it was really quick and easy. The meat was sweeter than I expected, but the jalape√±os and onions balanced it out nicely.

If you don't like Chinese 5 Spice, you won't  like this.  It has a very distinctive taste and we did not care for it.
