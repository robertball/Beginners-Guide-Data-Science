Just made this for a family of 6 with rave reviews. I boiled the pierogies first and skipped the sour cream but added a can of cream of celery. I used fresh crimini mushrooms and olive oil instead of butter. We will be having this again but I might be adding yellow bell peppers to give it more flavor.

This recipe is a great hit.  I had leftover ham from Christmas and came across this recipe and made it for dinner tonight.  My husband and I loved it.  He's glad he even has leftovers for work tomorrow.  I cut the recipe in half since it's only my husband and me.  I looked over the other reviews and tweaked the recipe a little.  I boiled the pierogies and added some dill, yellow bell pepper and topped it off with French Fried onions.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Made this for the kids to use up some of my left over ham in the fridge from Easter.  They loved and ate every bit of it.  I did not bake the pierogies, but boiled instead, only thing I did differently.  Great flavour and very filling.  I paired mine with fresh asparagus, instead of fruit for my preference.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is my 8 year old son's favorite meal believe it or not, he even asked me to make it for his birthday dinner.  It's become an understanding in my house now that when we have ham for any meal during the week we will be using the leftovers to make this later on :)

Heart attack on a plate with all the sour cream. Will try again, but omit the sour cream and salt. Boiling pierogis would reduce fat. Will also use olive oil instead of butter.

Excellent use of leftover Easter ham. Four stars, because the mushrooms seemed an odd addition.

It was 'healthier' after my minor changes, yet still tasty. I bought a lrg. 1 lb. slice of low sodium "Krakus" ham from the deli dept., which I diced.  I used fresh Crimini mushrooms instead of canned, and also used heart healthy soup.  BTW, it's "Pierogi", NOT Pierogies, since the word "Pierogi" is (already) plural.

I myself loved it and will make again..probably went the weather is cooler as it definitely is that homey comfort food (that might make you grow sum bulges). Made it pretty close, except I boiled them first and think I may have added extra diced ham steak. My picky kids were like ehhh...but they did eat it. I ate the rest the next day! Will definitely make much more in the fall and winter...even if it's all just for my greedy self!

This was a very easy dish to make. It was quite tasty. My kids liked it. It was a little too salty for me. I served a fruit salad with it which broke up the salty with sweet.

Very good and inexpensive dinner,when using frozen pierogies, In my opinion is to not bake as they will toughen up as another review mentioned but to add them to melted butter and 1/4 cup of water and put a lid on it. The steam thaws them, remove the lid and fry them as you usually would. Then finish off the rest of this yummy recipe.

I liked how easy this was too prepare. Baking the perogies in the oven made it simple to prepare but I found the perogies to be a bit tough. I think next time I make them I will thaw them for a bit and be sure to spray them very well with the cooking spray. I may not have sprayed them well enough. The sauce was delicious and I used fresh mushrooms as that was what I had on hand. I also put a tbsp or 2 of fresh chopped dill in. Dill on perogies is one of our favourites. I used this as a side dish to serve with our ham but I think it would be great with the ham mixed in as well. This is a recipe I am sure I'll use often. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

We are huge fans of pierogies, and this recipe didn't disappoint.  We are not mushroom fans, so I made a half batch of this recipe using green peppers in place of the mushrooms.  I liked the method of baking the pierogies first and then adding them to the pan.  I used a personal recipe 'Cream of Anything Soup Mix'  from AR to make the soup for the sauce.  I used green peppers in the soup, also.  I had mini size pierogies and they worked perfectly in this recipe and presented nicely. I paired this with fresh cut fruit and we enjoyed a nice dinners with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks anmlnrs, for sharing your version of pierogies.
