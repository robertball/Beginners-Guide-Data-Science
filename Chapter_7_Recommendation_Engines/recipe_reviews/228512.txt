I have never been a fan of pie crust, so I tried this crisp recipe with my fresh cherries.  This is a delicious recipe!  The 'crust' reminds me of an oatmeal cookie, which I love, and that flavor made sense with the cherries.  I did change the extract to almond, since I like almond extract with cherries.  I will try this next with peaches, and then I will use the vanilla, and will add some spices.  This will be my 'pie' recipe this year!

I had frozen (fresh picked)cherries which may have lead to too much liquid.  If I make again I would use only 1/2 the syrup recipe

I am a culinary arts student and was in a pinch to make a dessert.  I whipped this up as-is (using frozen cherries) and it sold out at our school's bistro.  The head of the department even asked for the recipe.  Fantastic!

I used the juice from the thawed cherries and added water to make 1 cup liquid for the cherry filling.

Thank you for excellent recipe. I had just picked the cherries off my tree and was wondering what to make. Your recipe came just in time. Delicious with vanilla ice cream.

Very good. I used my own pitted, tart cherries that I had frozen from last summer. When I made the syrup, I added the cherries right into the pan on the stove and then transferred all of it over the bottom brown sugar/oat layer, and then topped it with the remaining crumbles. It turned out beautiful! I used the full amounts of both the brown and white sugars, and glad I did since my cherries are very tart. I was skeptical about how well the filling would set up so I doubled the cornstarch, and it turned out perfect. I bake a lot and have my own "crisp" recipe that I usually use and this was a pleasant surprise (just a little different than my recipe). Would make this recipe again!

I followed the recipe for this exactly.  Unfortunately the bottom was pretty well stuck to the bottom of the pan (I didn't find anything that said to grease it).  It was pretty watery too even though the syrup had thickened. It tasted very good still!  It would have been better had the syrup been thicker.

I had a pack of fresh cherries that I wanted to make something with, coz we were all a bit bored of eating 'em cherries as is. I asked on the buzz, and Janet Shum suggested this to me. What a superb suggestion, and so easy to make too! I happened to have only 3 cups of pitted cherries on hand, but made no changes to the measurements for the crust/syrup. Although I did cut the sugar for the syrup by half. And when pouring the syrup over the cherries, I spooned the syrup over so that I could gauge whether it was getting too soggy or not. I had about 1/3 cup left of the syrup that I didn't use, for fear of it being too liquidy. I baked this for about 35minutes. The proportions and instructions are perfect and simple to follow. We tend to prefer our desserts a little less sweet so cutting the sugar in the syrup was perfect for us. Next time, I will reduce the brown sugar to half cup too. 
We loved the crust! Such an innovative spin! 
Thank you luvs2cook for this recipe and thank you Janet for suggesting it to me! 
Oh and I must add, we had these without ice cream coz we were out of ice cream. I imagine these would be divine with ice cream!!

We liked it, I made it full sweet but next time I'll do half. When making the syrup I added a tsp of almond extract too.  After reading about the syrup being too runny I used all the oat mixture in the crust and then made more for the topping and I added a touch of nutmeg.

Much too sweet for my liking. I'll try it again with premixed granola and a different kind of cherry, and skip the part with the cup of sugar in a sauce pan. The saving grace was the crumbly topping for crust.

The flavor is amazing. I followed the recipe to a tee with the exception of using the cherry juice instead of water. I have only four stars because there seems to be too much liquid. The liquid had started to thicken before I baked it so maybe next time I would use less?

My family and I loved this. I read a few reviews that said too much liquid so I cut the liquid part down by one-quarter (used 75% of what's stated in recipe) and it was perfect. We didn't have ice cream so ate with whipped cream. It was devoured and I'm already wanting to make another one!

This was the first time making Cherry Crisp for me. I think I have made every other kind of crisp there is, but when a friend gave me a bunch of fresh cherries I had the chance to make this one. We loved it!! The cherries I got were fresh but had been in a bag in the fridge for a few days, so I used the juice in the bag in place of the water and it turned out delightfully sweet and tart. YUM!!

Awesome! Me and my family LOVED it, and some of us don't like cherry, or cherry crisps. I used a cast iron skillet to bake it, and made the breading, but I put all the breading on the bottom. Then I make sure while another Bach of breading for the top, baked it like twenty minutes more, and yum.

I  also tried the crisp recipe with apples instead of cherries.  It tasted delicious. the only thing is you will have to cook the apples before baking it.
