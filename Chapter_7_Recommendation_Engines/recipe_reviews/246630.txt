4.5  There was no indication as to whether white or dark balsamic vinegar be used so I chose the latter.  No matter, it was a lovely change from a regular coleslaw or kale salad.  Should you not be able to procure baby kale, remember to "massage" mature kale to make it softer.  :)  Nice, light, flavourful dressing.
