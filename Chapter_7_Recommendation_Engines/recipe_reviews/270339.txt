I give the cooking method 5 stars! Nestling the chicken between the little bowls of beans and corn with the rice on a trivet above them was a super way to get a complete dinner in one pot! The recipe itself needs a little bit more to give it flavor. I followed the recipe exactly but tweaked it when I reheated leftovers. The rice was great as is. I added more salsa to the chicken plus a few drops of Texas Pete and topped everything with sour cream and cheese when I served it. Another time, I think I'd saut√© the chicken in the butter before adding the salsa.
