Delicious! I used a dried Chipotle chile pepper because it is a smoky sweet pepper similar to the Urfa Biber. Very good subtle spicy after taste, with just the right amount of chocolate. I scaled the recipe down to 1 and it made a very small cup. Next time I will scale to 2 servings and make 1 1/2 cups for me alone.
