Wow, cannot believe I'm the first to review this wonderful sauce!  

What a great way to use the bounty of fresh tomatoes at this time of year.  Followed the recipe exactly until the amount of time for the last simmering.  After step #2, I put the sauce on low and went to the nail salon.  When I returned more than an hour later, I found the house smelling like Italian food heaven!  

This sauce is on the garlic spicy side, but Paul Newman would love it! It tastes like his Sockarooni sauce but oh so much better.

I'm going to make it again soon with more of my tomato bounty, but this time it will be with a tad less garlic and spice and instead some mushrooms and fresh basil.  This recipe is fantastic.  Thanks!

I chose this recipe after reading all the great reviews. I made it exactly as the recipe with two exceptions. I only had a purple onion on hand so I used half of that. I also added 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms cause I love mushrooms in everything.
Unfortunately I did not taste the results before I added the balsamic vinegar. I do not like it with the vinegar. So if you are not crazy about vinegar like me taste the sauce before you add it.

Do not skip the vinegar, it's an essential ingredient in balancing this marinara. I always use brown sugar to taste instead of honey. This really is a winning recipe. My favorite on the whole site. It's that good.

I've made 10 batches (dble batch each time) and the only change is I ran out of honey once and used brown sugar.  It was still good.  I'm making a dble batch a day until I run out of tomatoes.  I'm freezing these so that we will have some all winter long.  One problem, my family loves this sauce so much they refuse to open another canned sauce.  I may have to hire a maid, or run away from home.  Thanks so much for thIs recipe.  IT'S
 GREAT!   Delora

Amazingly good. Well worth the effort to prepare. Would really like cup amount of tomato as my garden has multiple varieties -not all large. Plan on tripling 
next batch for freezing. Just a note: chili pepper does spice it up a bit too much for small children.

This is an easy, delicious sauce that I made for my boyfriend. He said it was the best spaghetti he's ever had! I highly suggest adding some mushrooms in with the onion to add earthiness and roasted red pepper (if you have some extra time) in with the tomatoes.

I've tried several fresh sauce recipes and this one is the best.  Made a few changes -  didn't have fennel; used fresh basil; and added a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste to thicken it slightly. Flavors blended well and I loved the addition of the balsamic vinegar. Wish I had discovered this recipe before using up most of my tomato harvest!

Oh my goodness,this is soooo good!! I just now finished making this sauce and I stuck to the recipe (with exception of marjoram,didn't have any). I also made some meatballs too and am seated with a bowl of delicious sauce and meatballs! This will be my 'go to' ALWAYS. I can see how the one reviewers boyfriend was blown away by this recipe. 
Wanted to say too that the tomatoes were from a friends garden,the onion from another and the garlic from a local family farm. A joint effort,indeed!

What a nice sauce. Great way to use fresh tomatoes. I like that it thickens as it cooks. Don't cover it.  Cook it exactly as recipe calls for.  Adding a little more spices won't hurt too.
 I added jalapenos instead of red pepper, & it was Wonderful !! will make this over & over.   Make this soon, Marcy

Very good & very flavorful!  Wonderful to make homemade marinara from my garden fresh tomatoes.  I followed the recipe as written, although I doubled it.  My sauce was a bit sweet prior to adding the Balsamic Vinegar - so after I added it - the sweetness was tamed.  (Probably a result of sweet tomatoes.)  My sauce ended up a bit watery, so I added a small can (6 oz.) of Tomato Paste to give it a little boost.  Cooked mine for 3 hours.  Will make this again!

Excellent flavor! I did not have fennel seed and it still came out very good. I bet fennel will enhance the flavor even more so will try that next time. The sweetness of the honey, coupled with the tartness of the vinegar, along with the spicyness of the crushed red pepper makes for an awesome result. Oh, I will definitely make this again. This is a keeper recipe.

I had a ton of tomatoes in our garden and wanted a recipe that would use them up.
This marinara is nothing like the traditional recipes, which call only for garlic, olive oil, tomatoes and basil. It looked interesting - and did not disappoint!
I thought some of the ingredients seemed odd, especially the balsamic vinegar, but as usual I made it exactly the way it was written as I do every new recipe.
The complexity of flavor is amazing! The tomatoes cooked down to a nice relatively smooth sauce (I didn't need the tomato paste as others suggested), the abundant garlic was not overpowering, and the herbs and honey lent sweetness and a whole new flavor profile.
This is a keeper for sure! Just don't expect the tomato-dominant marinara of your grandfather. Expect something entirely new - and absolutely delicious!

I made this tonight and we absolutely loved it.  It was a tad spicy for my husband so next time I will cut down on the red pepper flakes, as well as double the recipe to freeze. I used a whole onion as we love the flavor and cut the garlic into thick slices rather than minced.  It becomes sweeter as it melts into the sauce. I did not peel the tomatoes; to me it's a waste of time.  My sauce was so thick that I had to add water to thin it down. I also did not use the Balsamic, because I forgot. Thank you, Kerri, for a delicious recipe!

We made three different tomato sauces this weekend for freezing.  We are trying to find our go to recipe for our garden tomatoes.  This recipe won out!  Hands down best flavor.  We roasted our tomatoes to remove the skins and added the tomatoes and liquid from roasting.  We needed it to reduce a bit longer but the flavors were wonderful.  We will be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly except at the end where I poured the cooled sauce into my blender until slightly chunky. It tastes wonderful and am making homemade manicotta with it today.

Seriously, I just made two batches and I'm scared to death that by morning I'll have eaten all of it right out of the pan.  It is SO good!  I followed directions exactly, then ended up adding a can of tomato paste and letting it cook a lot longer.  I would also use less pepper next time.  Can't wait to serve this... assuming there's any left.  (I live alone, so it's very tempting to just dig in.)

I made this sauce with a large can of San Marzano tomatoes and it still turned out beautifully.  It actually tastes like a sauce from a proper Italian restaurant.  I divided the sauce and added some small slices of left-over ham to serve with bucatini for a twist on all' Amatriciana.  The remainder of the sauce will be perfect for chicken parmigiana.  This is my new go-to marinara!

This sauce states "fresh" tomato sauce and I used beautiful ripe red tomatoes straight out of our garden and it is wonderful.  I did use fresh oregano and basil finely diced. I doubled the recipe and froze to use this winter. When I use this sauce in December it will bring back the warmth and taste of summer tomatoes

I substituted thyme and sage for marjoram and I didn't have any fennel seed. I also added some mild sausage in the beginning with the onion because I was sharing with my 2 year old. Otherwise, I would've used spicy Italian. I also added 2 spoonfuls of tomato paste because I like a really rich sauce. I will make this recipe many more times. My husband was very pleased with the results after very impatiently waiting over my shoulder drooling over the smell demanding tastes.

Delicious! I make quarts and gave to my neighbors for Christmas, I can never eat store bought marinara sauce again. I also made a batch using canned tomatoes and it was good but didn't have the depth of flavor that fresh tomatoes gave to the sauce.

By end of summer, I had lots of garden tomatoes so I tried this recipe.  It was a hit.  The only change I made was to take another reviewers advice to add a little tomato paste near the end to thicken it up a little (about a half of the small can).  I think next time, I will decrease the black pepper, as the flavor of that is a bit strong for me, but still loved it!

This is the best marinara sauce and I've made and had many.  I used various tomatoes plum and others totaling 48 oz.  I blanched the tomatoes for easy peeling then  chopped them in food processor.  I would like to make a bigger batch next time to use more of my garden tomatoes and freeze some sauce for later.

The sauce is very good as written. I used a mix of chopped celery, carrots, and onions because I had some in the fridge. I didn't add the balsamic at the end because I was worried about that it would add too much acidity. And last personal preference, I blended the sauce-not a fan of tomato chunks. I used the sauce to make lasagna and it smells delicious cooking in the oven. This recipe is a keeper and I will be using it in the future!

Delicious sauce! Followed the directions as written, and pureed the sauce a tiny bit at the end with my hand blender to smooth out a couple of chunks of tomato. The amount of red pepper flakes made it a bit too spicey for our taste but thats just our preference. Going to make another triple batch of this with my remaining garden tomatoes and freeze to enjoy all winter! This recipe is a keeper!

This is insanely good. I have some to my garden friends and they both loved it, too!  To peel the tomatoes I used the method where you cut the tomatoes in half and then put the cut side down on a cookie sheet. Put the cookie sheet in oven on high broil about 12 minutes. Pinch off skin.

Wonderful recipe!  So easy, and a real treat.  Fennel was a yummy surprise.  I skipped the pepper flakes and added a small green pepper from my garden.  Used giant Burpee plum tomatoes, also from my garden.  Will make this again!!!

I need to admit that I forgot the balsamic at the end, and because of time,  I added all the spices and wine when I added the tomatoes and simmered for 30 minutes AND still this sauce was incredible I served it over spaghetti squash and it was sooo good. I will be making it again and again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe!  I didn't have fennel so left that out, didn't add the  balsammic vinegar and didn't peel tomatoes.  I also used an infusion mixer in the last minutes as I don't like big chunks.   I will probably put more chili pepper flakes in next time as I like it a little more spicy.  It cooked down and so I didn't have to add tomato paste  from a can.  I will use it again as my tomatos are just coming into their own in my garden and I love to have some frozen for use during the winter.

Best sauce I've ever made. 
My tomatoes were small, so I used 10. And I was out of bay leaf, so I had to skip that. Otherwise, I followed this exactly and it's crazy-good. My husband likes it and our picky 10-year-old asked, "what smells so good?" (She hasn't tried it yet.)
This will definitely be my go-to marinara going forward.

I love this recipe. I have already made 3 batches. The first I made exactly as stated. The second I doubled the batch and added a can of tomato paste to thicken it up. The red pepper flakes are perfect. They add a beautiful heat that doesn't stay on the tongue, it just makes the recipe interesting. I will freeze the first 2 batches. My third I'm canning and putting through a water bath. I'll make it without the red peppers for my folks, they're 74 and not fans of any heat. But this is definitely a keeper. Thank you.

It made 24 ounces. I substituted extra basil (fresh) & oregano for marjoram & fennel seeds. Really like the sauce, although I will use smaller amounts of  spices next time as the flavor is a little intense. I also roasted most of a garlic in oven at 400 for 30 minutes & included that.

I am very happy that I found this recipe! It is fresh and delicious! I followed the recipe as written and it suits my family's taste. I will probably never buy jarred marinara sauce again since this is relatively easy to make and it is absolutely perfect.

Yum!  I rendered it longer than the recipe suggests, to get a thicker consistency. Will definitely make again

Sooooo good! Followed the recipe as written, only variation was I cooked it longer to thicken more, used an immersion blender to take the chunkiness down a bit (but not to smooth), then added a half carrot and simmered an additional 30 mins (then discarded carrot) The depth of flavor is fantastic!

This is a good starting point.  Instead of the fresh tomatos, I used cans of crushed tomatos plus some tomato paste.  To be fair, I need to use the fresh tomatos next time.  I did like the thick, chuncky style.  Also, not a sugar person, so the honey worked fine but less is better; next time I may skip the sweetner.  As for taste, this recipe is a great start and since I like a more robust flavor, I needed to add some rosemary and double the seasonings.  Can't wait to try this one again with some adjustments.

I made this with fresh tomatoes from Tennessee (while visiting my vegetarian niece). I've never made marinara sauce before because I love meat sauce but this was exceptional!

I made this today, without the fennel and marjoram, as I didn't have any on hand.  Absolutely a wonderful sauce.  Will definitely be making again.  Thank you Kerri!

Best marinara I've ever had!  And I didn't even use any fennel seed, marjoram, or vinegar because I didn't have any at home.  I also used about 1/3 cup of fresh basil from my garden. My husband was raving and my 3 year old loved it as well!

After a busy day out with my elderly mother, I came home to my non-cooking husband, more than half way through the prep of this recipe.  He completed the sauce and would not let me even take a peek.  The only changes were to add a bell pepper from the garden and, because there was no honey in the pantry, he used some home made apple/pear jelly.  He used fresh basil and fresh oregano.  I don't care for fennel seed, oregano or vinegar in my cooked food, but these things were in there, and the flavor blend was exceptional.  Definitely  will make this again. --*Six weeks have passed since this review.  We have made this at least 10 times since then, w/ fresh tomatoes, peppers and herbs from the garden.  We have frozen several quarts of it.  We will cry when the frost finally gets the tomatoes. P.S. Because I don't know what " large tomato" means, I just chop 4 cups of tomatoes and pretend I am using 8 large tomatoes.

This was very good. I do grow my own tomatos and this was a perfect way to use them. I made no changes to the recipe but I did double it. I used a huge amount of cherry tomatos and about 11 Roma tomatos. No I did not peel them but I did use my hand blender at the end. I think any mix of tomatos will work peeled or unpeeled. It was just a wonderful way to use and freeze my homegrown tomatoes. We will enjoy during winter. Very good. Thx

This sauce turned out AMAZING....and that is not just the wine talking people!  Followed the recipe but I used fresh basil.  Looking on the net I found that finely chopped fresh basil is substituted 2:1 to dry.  I used the cheapest Merlot I could find cause I don't drink wine, well usually.  I also made a roux to thicken up the sauce after cooking it for an hour to reduce the tomatoes.  I placed it in the crock pot with the hamburger/Italian sausage mix to simmer and meld the flavors.  Wow......I think I may even impress my boyfriend who is an executive chef and owns a restaurant!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was so delicious!! I especially love the flavor that the red wine gives to the sauce. I used tomatoes from the garden. Served it with spaghetti squash also from the garden instead of pasta. Which to my surprise, I liked even better. I then baked it with mozzarella and Parmesan on top. And made meatballs from a recipe I got on here called "meatball nirvana". The meal turned out amazing, and everyone LOVED it. My husband said it is his favorite meal ever.

Wow, I thought I had a half-decent marinara sauce recipe - something I put together, but then I tried this and WOW - so zesty and delicious.  Couldn't buy anything any better if you ask me.  I think it must be the addition of the red wine and honey that makes it taste so rich (I had always added grated carrot to mine for a tad bit of sweetness).  Oh, I forgot to add the BV but also had read that some didn't care for that addition.  Just amazing.

I made this today simply to use up cheap tomatoes bought in my local market.  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar as suggested by some other reviewers.  I like it so much, I intend to go to the market again this weekend and over buy tomatoes just to make a big batch for the freezer.  So good. Thank you, this one is a keeper.

Made twice, let it boil down quite a bit since we like a thicker sauce. Made exactly as written. Also took others advice and let the chopped tomatoes drain in a colander for about 45 minutes. Had a large crop of tomatoes, so tripled the recipe second time.  Very satisfied with the taste and texture, the base recipe, however only yielded 2 pints of sauce (enough for the two of us for 1 meal) but it was worth the effort

Great taste and a great use of my garden tomatoes.  My only suggestion...  I simmered with a lid and it initially came out very liquidy.  I simmered another hour with the lid off an it was perfect.

This is really good, the only changes I made was while sautéing the onions I added the red pepper flakes and garlic(this might have contributed to it being more spicy) and after everything  was done I used an immersion blender to make it a little more saucy because my kids aren't big on chunky marinara. I serveded it over lightly sautéd zucchini and linguine.

I froze mine in ice cube trays then transferred to vacuum sealed bags for portion control  Amazing flavor, and it used up the last of the tomatoes from the fall garden.  Going to enjoy this all winter as dip for breaded mozzarella sticks or garlic bread.  Can add a cube to soups and other sauces too.

I've made many tomato sauces, even got blue ribbon at a fair for my Ketchup! This is by far the best  during this tomato season. Everyone raved about it. used Basil, no fennel growing here.

Great Sauce. I was looking for a recipe to use up  my home grown beefsteak tomatoes and this looked easy and it was.  I did follow the recipe but I think I could have used less garlic.  I love garlic but it overpowered the tomato somewhat.  I will definitely make more whilst the tomatoes last.
Update : have made it twice since reviewed and frozen it  for when my tomato season ends.

Outstanding. Family really liked this sauce.  Made as described, with only 2 changes: eliminated the hot pepper and added 1 tablespoon of tomato paste.   Served it over penne pasta for husband and teens, and over sautéed spiraled zucchini (for me).  Will be making this again with summer tomatoes.   Thank you!

Sorry, I hate to give a bad rating, but I couldn't make this recipe work. I used 2 tablespoons of fresh basil instead of the 2 teaspoons of dried, but otherwise made the recipe as written to start out. The sauce was acidic and didn't have a rich tomato taste (which might have been a function of our homegrown tomatoes?), so I added a teaspoon of sugar and 3 tablespoons of tomato paste ... also a half cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese to mellow the sharpness of the sauce .

This is forgiving. I skipped the honey (i didn't scroll down to see it until after i made it). I used chinese 5-spice, basically, if i was baking it would have been a disaster. It freezes very well, you can use what you have in your house spice-wise and it's amazing!

Alaska and fresh produce do not often meet. So in the summer when we can actually get fresh tomatoes & onions from the farmer’s market, I make this about once a week & freeze it. I use it as a guide at this point and just throw in whatever looks good. Sometimes zucchini, sometimes leeks...always extra onion and I substitute agave nectar for honey. Depending on what tomatoes I’m using, I sometimes let it cook down for awhile before I go to the last step. I’ve also been puréeing half of each batch and adding it back in, as we like a little thicker sauce.
I tried freezing it in single-serving sizes and that teenage human I spawned went through eight cups and two loaves of bread in a week as “snacks”. This recipe is seriously good.

This is the holy grail of homemade marinara sauce for me! The depth and nuance of the flavors is out of this world! Found it yesterday and decided to use the rest of my bumper crop of tomatoes. Made a batch last night and am making a double batch now ( and a third)  for the freezer. I did leave out the honey and did not make a substitution. It is simply marvelous!  Props to you, Original poster.

THIS IS AMAZING!! My first attempt at ever making my own sauce. I did not have any marjoram or red wine on hand, but otherwise, followed the recipe to a "T". I did have to guess at what "8 large tomatoes" translates to for the size of tomatoes I had,,,,,but the family loved it over pasta as well as a heckuva good pizza sauce!!!
A tad on the spicy side, but that's what makes the world go 'round!!

Awesome marinara sauce. I made 1 1/2 batches and added in bell peppers, zucchini & kale. I then added in my penne pasta to cook to al dente. I placed everything in a large baking pan and topped it with cheese. Because everything was precooked I put it under the broiler to brown the top. I wish I would have taken a picture! It was an amazing meal full of flavor! I will make this again!!

This sauce is absolutely delicious. I made the recipe exactly. I wanted to eat the sauce by the spoonful but resisted the temptation. My kids and husband love it. The blend of herbs and wine with this add a really nice dimension to the flavor. Very fresh tasting and makes me want to have this in the winter to brighten up a cold day. I will make this again in large batches to either can or freeze.

This is an excellent recipe - I didn't make any changes to it (other than omitting the balsamic vinegar) and everyone in the family loves it! The only reason I didn't add the balsamic is that we loved the taste so much prior to that step that we didn't think anything else could improve it. Either way, I think the wine, the honey and the red pepper flakes really make this recipe great. I like to let it simmer for a bit longer than the recipe calls for, but it is still very good made as instructed. Have made this several times and it is always a favorite!

I made this twice. the first time I followed the recipe exactly and it came out delicious of a bit watery. the next time I doubled the recipe so I can can some for the winter when fresh tomatoes are harder to come but, but I did not want it as watery as last time. So I removed all the seeds of the tomatoes and cooked it down for a longer period of time (about 2 to 3 hours) and it came out better than the first time. the second time I also diced up some mushrooms and cooked it with the onion. This is an amazing recipe.Hey

Excellent sauce.  Great way to use fresh tomatoes but also works well with canned tomatoes.   I made the recipe as written with the following changes,   oregano and marjoram  together is too much for this family's taste buds.  I just use oregano.  Also, it needs to simmer for at least an hour, especially if your using fresh tomatoes.  I've made several batches and froze in small containers.  Freezes great.

This is an amazing sauce! It was so good I couldn't believe I was capable of making something so good! The wine adds such a great flavor and even though I forgot both times when I made it to put the balsamic vinegar in last (I added it with the other ingredients) it was fantastic! I have to say I wasn't looking forward to all the extra work it takes to make fresh sauce from tomatoes, but I had so many from our garden that they were going to spoil. Now I know I'll make this again and again. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

so good! I freeze in mason jars in a deep freezer and they thaw just as amazing! I always seed my tomatos and drain for a couple hours or overnight for a thicker sauce. Sometimes I still need tomato paste. I also love to add peppers in from my garden, whatever's available.  Makes a perfect easy dinner, quickly unthaws tastes like you worked all day!!

This is a very good base sauce using home grown tomatoes.  I cooked it a bit longer than suggested to insure it cooked down.   It turned out so good that my husband wanted to can another batch from our over producing tomato plants.  So here I am making another double batch.  Thanks!

This is my go-to recipe for a marinara from scratch. Making it right now, actually. I don't like fennel seeds so I skip them. I used them the first time I made this and it was still amazing. Even though I was sure I wouldn't care for the fennel seeds, I gave them a shot regardless because I think they add an authenticity to the recipe.

this was my first attempt at making tomato sauce and it was a slam dunk. It was very easy and fun as well, except for skinning the tomatoes. I should have blanched them just a little longer and had an icier water bath. Otherwise I am so happy with the results!

I've made and canned this sauce twice now and it is the best hands-down.  Try it, you won't be disappointed, I promise!

This is an outstanding recipe.  I made it absolutely as written and it was delicious.  We had some of it with rotisserie chicken and I froze the rest. I have since made a double batch and frozen it so we can enjoy this many times.

This was fantastic!  I made one change only because I did not have red wine, so I used a blush wine instead.  Still came out fantastic.  Will make again and again.  This will now be my go to recipe during the tomato harvest.

It was delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly except for the marjoram - didn't have any. Definitely will make it again and freeze some for the winter. So much better than the store bought one!!!

It was a great pile of lovely spices and flavors. This was only my second try at home made sauce and used our own tomatoes. It was a bit too sweet but think that came from my tomatoe choice- not the recipe.

I found his recipe while trying to lower the sodium in our family's life. It is absolutely fabulous! I like it with Roma tomatoes because they have more flavor and don't get mealy when they cook down. I also like to add fresh mushrooms with the onion. Tonight in trying it without the mushrooms and adding a little extra crushed pepper to use as an enchilada sauce.

Excellent recipe. The first time I made it I thought it was too sweet so the second time I left out the honey and added an additional amount of spices. I used Early Girl tomatoes so I need to simmer it down more. I also left the peels on and used my handheld mixer (the kind for making milkshakes) and blended it all.

Everything in this recipe was great, aside from the amount of garlic.

This for me, was way too much garlic. It overpowered the entire dish and practically ruined the hard work. It was so spicy that I couldn't taste anything but the garlic and this was really too bad as until it was added the sauce was grade-A!

Fantastic recipe! I was looking for one to try that didn't involve "canned" tomatoes/paste.  Next time I make this, I'll probably leave out the crushed red pepper because it was a little spicy (more for the kids than for me) but otherwise, it was great! I used this on the Stuffed Shells III recipe (available on this site) in place of "jar" sauce, and it was great!  Looking forward to trying it again with spaghetti sometime :D

I omitted the wine and used fresh basil, oregano, and rosemary. It simmered for a couple of hours before adding just a small amount of balsamic vinegar. It was very delicious.

This was AWESOME!! Excellent flavor! This recipe drew me since it used fresh tomatoes and I had some that needed to be used. The wine, honey, fennel were all interesting ingredients that oddly complemented each other well. Red pepper adds a kick that even us who crave spice could recognize as a good "kick". A definite keeper!

This was amazing.  I have never made marinara from scratch and this was so easy.  I did use fresh tomatoes but next time I will try canned diced petite tomatoes for saving time and dishes.  I didn't have fennel seeds so I substituted with 1 star anise (next time will try 2 or 3) which worked great.  I love crushed red pepper but will not use as much next time.   I also forget the balsamic vinegar but didn't miss 
it.  This is definitely my go to sauce.

This sauce came out absolutely delicious. My only complaint is that I wish it was a bit thicker. I'm going to make it again today, but I will strain the tomato chunks.
Thanks for the recipe. Sauce in a jar has too much sodium and isn't half as good.

Very flavorful sauce. It would be helpful to have a cup amount of tomatoes since I only had 8 tomatoes and didn't remember to check their size. Also ended up being a little too acidic for my taste so I added baking soda in 1/2 teaspoon amounts and mixing well to taste.

I have used this recipe everytime I make my marinara sauce. The only thing I have changed is the 2 tsp of Balsamic Vinegar. I only use a 1/2 tsp because its to tangy.. I hope you love this as much as I do, then I let it cool and I put it in my seal and vacuum bags. just seal the bags not vacuum.

I used regular beef steak tomatoes for this since that is what the garden was full of!  But of course it meant lots more time boiling it down to a thicker sauce and then stirring in a little potato starch near the end to ensure it didn't have a watery base at the bottom of the plate of spaghetti!  I'm giving this a 4 because I found the spices were a little bland as called for.  It needed more for me to say WOW!  So I doubled the spices, added about 4 tbsp onion powder, 1 tsp celery seed and doubled the wine.  Just my own preference, but I need things to say WOW when people eat it.  I will certainly make again and thank you for sharing!

Followed the recipe, doubled the onion, excluded the balsamic, and let it simmer for an additional 30 minutes - used the time to drink the remaining red wine. The additional simmer time made a difference - resulting in a spicier sauce. Taste it occasionally after it's been simmering for a while. The results are excellent.  Intend to make this several times over the next week or so, planning to freeze some.

It would help to have an estimate of the tomato volume to help avoid putting in too little tomato.  I think extra simmer time would properly flavor the sauce if too much tomato is used.

Made this twice more. Each time I simmered about an hour longer with great results. Noticed that the flavor varied from batch to batch, even using tomatoes from the same vines. Recommend tasting periodically after an hour of simmer and adjusting spices. Only one batch benefited from adding the balsamic vinegar, but it did improve the taste.

This is my second time making this sauce. The first time I didn't have any red wine and it still came out great. Tonight I used the wine and it was amazing!!! I also added two green bell peppers with the onion and I didn't use the fennel either time. Next time I'll try it with mushrooms as other reviewers suggested. It is a thinner sauce but if you prefer a thicker sauce a can of tomato paste will do the trick. Thank you for posting this recipe, I'm done searching for the perfect marinara!

I usually make Salsa with my Roma tomatoes from my garden!  This year my Roma tomatoes are ripening slow, so there wasn't enough to make my Salsa.  
So I gave this recipe a try and it was fantastic!  We ate it over Cheese Ravioli and everyone loved it.  Since then I have made this 4 more times to put in the freezer to eat during the winter months!  I finally was able to make Salsa today and still have enough to make another batch of Marinara Sauce tomorrow.

BEST FLAVOR EVER!A little runny. Next time I will squeeze the juice out of half of the tomatoes and yes there will be a next time & a next time ... This was amazing. Left it simmer a couple of hours to thicken more but it was sooo worth it.

Mine turned out super, super runny. The flavor is good though, so I'm willing to give it another shot. I'll just probably scale back by a tomato or two, or try tossing in something to either help soak up the juice or thicken it up.

This sauce is fantastic - it’s got a nice complexity of flavors, slightly sweet, pleasantly spicy.

Super delicious! I peeled the tomatoes by scoring the bottoms in a cris cross cross and blanched for 30 seconds. Worked perfect! Followed recipe as is and it turned out great. I did blend the sauce to make it smooth. It was the best! Will make it many more times.

Okay, if you see a photo that looks off... well, that’s mine! It’s because I turned it into neat sauce using ground turkey. Otherwise I used the recipe exactly as indicated. I just browned the meat alone as the tomatoes were stewing during the first half hour. Once I added the rest of the ingredients to the recipe, I added a small can of tomato paste, and cooked it a few more minutes till it was all well unified. At that point, I added the entire sauce to the meat and allowed it to cook together for the next 30 minutes before adding the balsamic vinegar as recommended. Impressive! So good!

The hardest part about this recipe was peeling the tomatoes (I'm a novice).  I used this recipe this evening (minus the fennel seeds as the store was out), and my family raved about it.  Never buying store-bought sauce again!

I'm no Italian food expert, but this is really the only marinara recipe I've found that I really enjoyed.  

I didn't have red wine - I used white.
I didn't have honey - I used a little sugar.
I omitted the red pepper flakes.

Very nice!

Oh my. Best sauce I’ve ever made. I doubled the recipe, used 16 cups of fresh tomatoes, substituted brown sugar for the honey, and let it simmer for a few hours. Next time I’m quadrupling, because it’s just that good.

Fabulous sauce. Thanks so much for sharing. So good on everything, including just a simple piece of toasted garlic bread. I use 2 quarts of tomatoes -- fresh, or my home-canned, or store-bought crushed tomatoes (you can make this all year round).

I made the recipe exactly as it’s written using some extra Roma tomatoes I had from my garden and it was so good! It has a nice little kick too from the red pepper flakes, but I’m sure if they are left out this recipe would still be good. Definitely a keeper and one I will use over and over again!

I love this recipe for marinara. No I take that back, my whole family loved this sauce. I was looking for recipes to make to use up my tomatoes from my garden. This was so good. My daughter said have a jarred sauce is no longer a option after having tasted this sauce. I did leave out the balsamic vinegar because I am not a fan of the flavor of that ingredient.

I did not have enough tomatoes, so i used a mixture of summer squashes, about half and half. I forgot the wine and used slightly more of the stated seasoning. I added a half a can of tomato paste to thicken and darken the sauce and I used an immersion blender to puree until mostly smooth. taste delicious. I also used brown sugar instead of honey and forgot the vinegar

Delicious and super easy! I chopped the tomatoes a little to coarse, so I put it through the processor but other than that it was perfect.

Overall, the sauce was tasty but a little on the sweet side- maybe the tomatoes? Worked well with my manicotti.

I made it and doubled the recipe using a mixture of plum tomatoes and regular large slicers. I changed the marjoram to savory  since I didn't have any marjoram, then halved the amount in case I was foolish to do it but it seemed to add a deep flavor.  I also blanched and peeled the skins from the large tomatoes and removed some of the seed pulp.
I cooked it up and then used a food mill to remove the rest of the seeds and the skins. After that I then returned it to the pot and simmered it until it cooked off some of the liquid and then added the balsamic to taste. A tbspn. was just right.  It is delicious and has alot of flavor points and a rich base.

I used tomatoes and  herbs grown in my own garden and I think there wasn't quite enough tomatoes on my end, but it smells fantastic. It was simple and fun to make. Can't wait to try it again.

My only complaint is that it was a bit too spicy hot for me.  I did not have red wine, fennel or marjoram.  I used fresh basil.  I may skip the honey next time, my home grown vine ripe tomatoes were sweet enough.  I only used 1/4 vinegar.  My recommendation to others making this is to taste as you go along.  But very tasty and good otherwise.  I will make this again with no crushed red pepper.

This was great. They only thing I did different was to cool the sauce and then blend it in a blender since I have kids who do not necessarily like to have chunks of tomatoes.

The biggest change I made was to throw everything into a slow cooker for six hours.  I also eliminated most of the vinegar (my wine might have been a bit vinegary) added 1/2 can of tomato paste (the little one) to thicken and blended the sauce before serving (because my guy is not so excited about chunks of tomato).

It was really really good.

I will definitely be using this recipe again. I tripled the recipe to freeze in freezer bags. The only changes I made was I substituted brown sugar for the honey since I did not have enough honey, and I used a little less red pepper to make the spice just a bit more subtle to suit my taste. I'm not always an exact measurer so maybe about half of what is called for. Otherwise this recipe is perfect as written! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for! I am growing herbs as well as tomatoes, so I used fresh herbs  and I also had fresh bay leaves I'd bought. It turned out delicious! I had to play around a bit to get the herb/tomato ratios right since I did have fresh herbs, but even when it wasn't perfectly balanced, it was still amazing. I was tempted to make some changes the first time I tried it, but I would recommend not doing that. Make it exactly as written, then make changes to taste. I loved the addition of the balsamic, but if you don't like it, try another vinegar-- perhaps apple cider, rather than just not using it. I think it's necessary to use it to brighten up the flavors and add a touch of acid, especially if some of your tomatoes are on the sweet side. I have a lot of varieties of tomatoes and used them all. I concur with someone's comment that some type of measurement for tomatoes would be helpful since I used everything from cherry tomatoes to beefsteak. The last time I made it, I cooked the tomatoes first since I do have some heavily seeded varieties, and then used a crank style food mill to remove the seeds and skin. The resulting sauce was very watery, so I cooked it down some before continuing on with the recipe.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The only changes that I would recommend, is to test before adding sugar because not all tomatoes require sweetening. And I took about half of the sauce and puréed it and added it back to the rest of the sauce. That made it a little bit smoother rather than chunky and watery. Also, if you can, use Roma tomatoes. They are meatier and so you won’t end up with a really watery sauce. Truly, the best marinara sauce I have ever had, and I made it from tomatoes from my own garden!

this recipe cans nicely and is wonderful on everything.

I always doctor it a bit. Less of this, more of that. Lots more garlic.  I double the recipe and end up with 5 pints of canned product.

This was a very good recipe . I will make it again but without the red pepper flakes. I think it over powered the other great flavors and seasonings. I added fresh basil at the end of cooking.

This was delicious, the best marina I've ever had.  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden and added cooked ground beef the next day.

Used fresh basil, adding after finished cooking.  Simmered 2 hours as tomatoes were particularly watery.

I love this marina sauce when tomatoes are at their peak. I double the recipe, use an immersion blender  to blend until smooth and freeze for future use.

Whoa Baby!!!  This was divine!  Not too hard after viewing a YouTube on how to peel tomatoes quickly and easily.  The skins almost fell off after blanching for a minute and putting them into ice water after that.  Such a fresh taste and it used up a lot (2.5 lbs) of small tomatoes from the garden.   Like one other reviewer, I added all the ingredients at the same time after sauteing the onions.  Only needed to simmer for 30 minutes that way.  Left out the vinegar because I liked the sweetness of the honey but I may try it next time just to see.  Made enough for my husband and I to get 2 meals out of it.

Super tasty, I had to substitue white wine for the red wine, because I did not have any red.  It was delicious, but next time I will definitely use red, as I'm sure it adds color and depth.

Thought it was excellent!  Followed the recipe pretty closely and didn’t quite double it. I used Chianti for the wine, brown sugar since I didn’t have honey and I didn’t bother peeling the tomatoes. I did cook it for several hours and added one small can of tomato paste to thicken it a bit. Definitely will make it again.

I only ended up using half of the balsamic vinegar and I’m glad I tasted before adding any more. I substituted some of the chopped onion for a clove of shallot because shallots are delicious on everything. I used an immersion blender right into my Dutch oven to get rid of any chunks. Used a mortar and pestle to grind the pepper flakes and fennel seed so the sauce stays smooth. I also did the final simmer for about 3 hours before I was really happy with the result. The additional reduction seems to have smoothed out any rough edges. The end result is pretty amazing.

This is a great recipe. I don't have wine in the house, so I skipped that and the bay leaf and it turned out just great. I used my emulsion blender to get rid of any chunks since my family prefers smoother sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

Last minute decision so I went ahead and made this without the bay leaf, marjoram, fennel seed and crushed red pepper and it still came out heavenly. The scent of it cooking was awesome as well.

I really loved this sauce.  I needed to use up the last of the cherry tomatoes so I used the first steps in the Tomato Harvest Marinara Sauce recipe here then, after reducing the sauce, followed this recipe for the most part with the addition of some Italian pork sausage, which meant that I could rely on that for much of the Italian seasoning in the sauce.  I did put in fresh basil and Oregano.  I like the honey and wine but omitted the vinegar.  This is a great sauce that I will use again.  Thanks .

Wonderful!  This is my new go to sauce.  I used my instant pot for this...  set to manual for 15 minutes, and natural release for another 20 min.. I also doubled the recipe as others have and added Italian sausage, one 6oz can of tomato paste.  It is awesome... i'm letting the rest simmer in the instant pot on keep warm, it just keeps better and better!! :)

I used 6 cups of cut up Roma tomatoes, halved the honey & vinegar, and eliminated the fennel. I used an immersion stick processor to break up chunks after 45 minutes of simmering. Smells & tastes wonderful!

This was my first attempt at making sauce from fresh tomatoes. Trying to eliminate as many canned foods as possible. However, the tomato paste is a must for the correct texture.  Blanched the tomatoes, then cooked them down before adding anything. The sauce was very nice. Added Sweet Italian Sausage and used for lasagna. Will make this again.

Great marinera sauce, the only change I would make is reduce the amount of honey in half and a little less vinegar. Otherwise it's perfect. It taste like too much vinegar immediately after making but taste a lot better the next day. I will make it again soon. Be sure to taste the tomatoes b4 adding all the honey. If your tomatoes are sweet you may not need any honey.

So good! I will definitely make it again. I did not have any fennel or balsamic vinegar so I left the fennel out and used apple cider vinegar instead. I'm not sure I'll ever try the fennel,  but I  look forward to the balsamic next time I make it. I did not use as much red pepper as called for since my kids were going to eat it. I also ended up adding some tomato paste in order to thicken the sauce up a bit.

Wow!  Fantastic!  Hubby usually does not like marinara without meat, but he had 3 servings of this!  I loved it, too.  I didn't have marjoram or fennel seed, and I used brown sugar in place of honey, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I would very highly recommend.  Next time I'll make a double batch.

I made this with some farm fresh tomatoes.  For some reason, even before I added the added the balsamic vinegar, the flavor was very bitter.  It may have been the tomatoes.  However, I doubt I will try this recipe again.

I have made this sauce several times and absolutely love it. The only things I do differently are saute fresh mushrooms (cut into chunks) with the onion, use fresh herbs instead of dry (3x as much of each, since dry herbs are 3x as strong), omit the fennel, and add a small can of tomato paste. I leave the tomato skins on when I cut up the tomatoes  and love what they add to the sauce. This is truly one of my favorite things.

Excellent recipe. I added a carrot and a stalk of celery to the onion at the beginning and did not add the red pepper. It has a wonderful flavor and is particularly good over whole wheat pssta.

My first time making homemade marinara sauce and this recipe was great! I added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste to thicken it a little. Great tasting yummy!!

Great sauces.  I like it thicker so added a cup of celery and two cups of mushrooms.   Used a whole cooking onion and 1/2 tsp of fennel seeds.   Let it simmer for 2 hours with lid on, slightly askew and then simmered for two more hours with lid off so it would reduce and be pretty thick.   Added 2 cups of water to beginning simmering process so it would not reduce too quickly.  I love this stuff.  It is the start for great pasta with prawns, chicken, or ground beef.  I will do lots of batches in the future.

Well, a version of it anyway.  I had a lot of missing ingredients as I decided to make it at the spur of the moment and I didn't want to go to the store.  I had 3 very ripe tomatoes, only dried herbs, no fennel, no marjoram, and no honey (because it didn't sound good) and it came out pretty darn good.  Very clean tasting and light.  Next time I make it, I will use the 8 tomatoes.

Loved this sauce, but it's spicy!  Made the first batch as written & my husband raved!  I made a second batch without the crushed red pepper for family who don't like spicy & it was also delicious. ,

This was delicious and well worth the time.  I used hot house tomatoes; the only thinges was that it seemed a bit thick before the final 30 minutes simmer period. I added a cup of water.  Perfect for spaghetti and meatballs.

Used all fresh tomatoes , ground in my blender.  Used fresh Basil and Oregano, just because I had it.  Probably will use less red pepper flakes, and there is also black ground pepper.

Will use this recipe again, and again.

Had to omit the red wine for my grandma's dietary restrictions. Also, used 2 Roma tomatoes (with skin) for every large tomato and put it in the food processor before cooking. Other than that, made as is. Tasted great but next time I would go easy on the pepper.

Very flavorful sauce. Spices and herbs were just right. Though I found even after letting it reduce for around 3 hours on low heat I still needed to add a small amount of tomato paste to get it to stick to the pasta and not end up being soup.  But adding the paste took nothing away from the overall taste.

This came out so delicious... way better than store bought.  We had quite a few tomatoes from the garden we needed to turn into a sauce and this recipe did our tomatoes justice, I am looking forward to cooking it again.  The only thing we didn't have was the fennel seeds, but we're not huge fans of fennel so that wasn't missed.   Thank you for providing this wonderfully simple but completely delicious recipe!

Came out great, I had to improvise a little since I didn't know how many small roma tomatoes equal a large tomato. Threw in some fresh herbs along with figured why not?
Very tasty sauce! Didn't even peel the tomatoes just hit it with an immersion blender a little.

I always make recipes exactly as written the first time and then make changes as needed. This recipe was perfect the first time! I had fresh tomatoes from my garden. I used it on top of veggies, baked potatoes, and pasta. Wonderful! I'm making another batch to put in the freezer for future use.

Delicious! Used 8 on the vine tomatoes, cut in half, broiled them for 15 minutes and let them cool. Skin peels right off. I didn't have red wine but used a blush and it was still great.

My Italian husband loved this sauce!  It was awesome! I had no fennel, totally omitted the sugar and vinegar.  I will most definitely make this from now on.  Simple and delicious! I will try it with fennel and maybe the vinegar next time just to see what difference they will make. I will miss 'real' tomatoes. Not sure how canned will taste, but willing to try when the summer harvest is gone.

This is a great basic marinara recipe .   I made a few little tweaks to suit our families taste,  I omitted the balsamic vinegar and added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and added some fresh basil.   Definitely a keeper!

Follow close the recipe...skin (hot water to cold) and seed into a small mesh strainer.  Once close to full, I use a spoon to swirl around to get the juice into to bowl below.  I strain again when added to the rest of the tomatoes ( you don't have to seed, but I like it better)
I used brown sugar instead of honey and made many batches without the fennel seed, and it was still delish.   I low simmer for as long as I can - typically 2-3 hours.   Once done, I use my immersion blend to get a smoother consistency.  I also use about 4-6 different varieties of tomatoes (what ever is ripe) and I always throw in a good bunch of cherry as well...

Added only half the balsamic vinegar and I really don't like it.  It seems to take the wonderful "fresh" flavor of the tomatoes away.  But before the vinegar was added, the sauce was wonderful!

This was a delicious sauce! Instead of crushed peppers, I added a fresh jalapeño pepper. It was a bit watery but I just simmered it until it reduced. I will definitely make again!

I made the recipe without changes and found all I could taste was garlic and salt. Those beautiful fresh tomatoes got left behind.  Maybe my garlic was stronger than the author's?

I was out of fennel seed and my husband doesn't like spicy so I left out the red chili and it is a great sauce. Easy to make and wonderful flavor. Definitely worth making.

I used fresh herbs from the garden, and I added a bit of red wine and hot pepper flakes.  The sauce is a bit sweeter because of the fresh tomatoes, but a good, salty , freshly-grated, as a topping balanced it all out.
This was great with homemade meatballs...I used fresh garden herbs, spicy Italian sausage, ground sirloin, and gluten free crumbs. All the leftovers were gone.

Tripling the recipe, I didn't have time to skin the tomatoes, so I cut them in chunks, drained them for several hours,  cooked in a large pot with skins on, and then put the sauce in two crockpots on low with lids off (tea towels on) overnight to thicken it a bit.  Finished it off by using my immersion blender to make the skins disappear and make a  smooth sauce.  I used a combination of Cherokee purple, German stripe, and orange blossom tomatoes.

This was a really good recipe, but I agree with one of the other reviews...it's a little bland. I will make this again, but I will definitely double the spices next time. Definitely add the vinegar..it really makes the sauce a genuine marinara. Yum :)

I made this with fresh basil (3tablespoons) from. y garden vs dried, sauteed the onion but took it out since my family is finicky about the onion texture, added 1/4 tsp onion salt, added 1/4 dried thyme and 1 sprig fresh rosemary then transitioned this to my crock pot to cook all day and added 1.25 pounds cooked ground beef drained of fat and let cook another hour.  This was the best ever!  I loved the fennel seed in the recipe along with the red wine.  Of course I removed the bay leaf and sprig or rosemary before adding ground beef.

This sauce is pretty potent!  It is packed full of flavor so a little goes a long way.  I did a few things differently:
-I roasted the tomatoes first to peel them and make them softer.
-I did not have marjoram or fennel so I used a teaspoon of "Italian Seasonings"  
-I used fresh basil rather than dried 
-and I added about three tablespoons of butter.

My garden had a bounty of tomatoes this year so off to the marinara factory they went. I have probably committed a faux pas, but I did not peel my tomatoes. The whole thing was thrown into the pot and cooked until soft, then I used an emersion blender to give me a lovely texture! I plan to freeze the sauce and bring it out in the dead of winter to reminisce about a really wonderful summer!
