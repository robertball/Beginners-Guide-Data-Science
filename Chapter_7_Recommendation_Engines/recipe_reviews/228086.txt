I really liked this recipe. I did not use, or miss, the habanero peppers.

A simple and very tasty salsa.  I made the mistake of using two particularly hot habeneros once.   A half cup of crushed pineapple took the heat down and added a nice extra flavor. Very good with or without pineapple added.

Outstanding. The habanero puts this salsa over the top.

I don't like spicy stuff so I cut out the hot peppers and substituted zucchini. I also changed the lime juice for lemon juice, simply because that's what I had on hand. Husband liked it on his chips.

Loved this. I made one without the habanero and one with. Both were delicious. Next time, Iâ€™ll seed my tomatoes, it was a bit runny but still super delicious.

I have used this as a base recipe twice and made just a couple adjustments. Added another Jalapeno on top of the existing one and the habanero, also added two small cans of El Pato Tomato Sauce; Mexican Spicy Tomato Sauce.

I'm sorry to say that this has not been the best salsa for me.  I kept right to the recipe except for the habaneros but, I like a thicker salsa.  If I make again I'll just chop and mince and not put in a blender/processor.  The taste was good but  just not the consistency that I like.  I have found the Ex-Girlfriend's Mom's Salsa Fresca on this site is what I like better.  Just me.

What else do you want in a salsa?  I used two serranos instead of the jalapeno and habanero.  I added lots of salt and it's perfectly spicy.

I did a few modifications for this so I could put this in a blender for a few pulses to make it a faster recipe. Reduced onion to 1/4 and used white onion instead to get a sweeter result, reduced the lime to 1/2 a lime and put the fruit (not skin) into the blender, and added salt. Kept the habanero and jalapeno (used small ones), and this turned out great. Put in blender in large cuts (halfed the tomato, large cuts of onion, whole cilantro bunch, etc) and a few pulses an it was a perfect blend.

Instead of the jalapeno and habanero, I substituted some salsa peppers from my garden. Since I had never grown that pepper variety before, I wasnt sure how much to use, and got it way too hot. Added a couple of fresh peaches to it, now I have  a really sweet, yet hot, peach salsa.

Definitely will make again. I did not have any jalepeno peppers and it still came out good. I did add 2 garlic cloves instead of one.
