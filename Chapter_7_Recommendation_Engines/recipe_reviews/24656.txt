Really great as a veggie dip, but I would not use it with crackers or chips.

This dip was awful~!~~ I would not make it again I was so dissapointed with it. The dip had no flavour of peppers, all you can taste is the sour cream.

I made this twice and it is very delicious! I did add extra hot pepper sauce - also added a small can of minced black olives - Yummy. I served it with the blue tortilla chips! LOVED IT!

Good & easy recipe w/ a few minor adjustment - added a bit more hot sauce & a little more red peppers  & let it chill overnight. Was a hit w/ everyone at my office w/ crackers & veggies!
