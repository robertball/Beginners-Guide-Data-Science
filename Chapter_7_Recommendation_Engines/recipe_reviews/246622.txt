I used 1/2 pumpkin/cinnamon flavored chips and the other 1/2 mini chocolate chips. I made regular size muffins at 350 for about 40 minutes (mine were extra full!) Super simple and moist. I want to make a cream cheese frosting to top these next time!

Super quick and easy to make! An easy recipe to make with kids. I like to dust the top of the muffins with light powdered sugar and either roasted cinnamon powder or regular cinnamon powder. Definitely crave these every now and then

11.22.17  Not sure what happened here, but these muffins were a disappointment.  I was expecting more pumpkin flavor, and I did use the pumpkin pie mix, not pumpkin puree.  It certainly was easy to mix together, but recipe says 24 muffins, and I ended up with 36 mini muffins and 4 regular size muffins, so confused about that, too.  Unlike the first photo uploaded on this recipe, the chips melted into the muffin affecting the texture. They weren’t bad, they just weren't that good, a bit bland.  They’ll be eaten, but I won't be making these again.  Sorry for the less than favorable review, but I do want to be honest.

All five of my kids really liked these mini-muffins.  So do I.   The best part is how simple  this recipe is to make.   My 11-year-old made this easily.
