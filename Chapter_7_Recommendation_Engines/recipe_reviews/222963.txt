Good base recipe. I made a number of changes, based on what I had on hand. I used regular Philly cream cheese, added orange and red peppers, garlic and lime juice. Sauteed the onions and peppers in olive oil, cilantro and garlic and then added the cream cheese and lime juice. Then I stirred in the shrimp and cooked for 5 minutes. Served in the tortillas with the coleslaw mix and cheese. Family was very happy!

I did not like this recipe. The cooking Creme was good but not for tacos. It tasted like an Alfredo sauce.  I was thinking more Mexican flavor when I thought tacos.  I would use it again but in a different dish. I think this recipe would have been better using the fish tacos white sauce.

This was not bad. I read the review about it tasting like Alfredo sauce so to help avoid that, I added a couple of tsp of chili powder (taco seasoning would work too) to give it a hint of familiar flavour. I also used a fresh salsa I had made. I used frozen cooked shrimp so didn't bother grilling them. They were the small kind (100/200 per lb) so fit more on a tortilla (flour because I couldn't find corn). It seemed excessively saucy (there was a lot extra after all the shrimp was gone), but I would probably make it again

I wasn't sure how I would feel about this recipe...cream cheesy shrimp tacos? Glad I tried it because it was fantastic! I served it on a tortilla with refried beans.

These were great. I added some old bay seasoning and I didn't grill my shrimp. Just seemed like an unneeded step. Will make again.

Oh my god these r so good. I did add garlic to the onions and taco seasoning to the cream cheese. I also fried the flour tortillas. It tasted so fresh with a little kick, my family loved this I will make it again.
