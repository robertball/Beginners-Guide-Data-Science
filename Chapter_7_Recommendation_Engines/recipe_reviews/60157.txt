A nice alternate from the regular salad, especially if it's the dinner club. Next time though I will use a more tart yellow grapefruit rather than the sweeter red, just to suit my own taste. I added a sprinkle of sunflower seed as well to compliment the arugula.

I changed the recipe a bit by just using orange juice and eliminating the grapefruit juice. It turned out mild and delightful and I plan on making this dressing often from now on. As far as the salad itself, I added the suggested walnuts plus a few little bits of goat cheese which went well with the juicy pear.

This was alright but the dressing was just too light.  I think it would be fine with something a bit heartier.

This is the best salad I have ever had!  I used all grapefruit juice since I was out of oranges and added sunflower seeds, as another poster suggested.  Who knew something so simple could be so delicious?

I just love arugula Jeanette and eat it at least three times a week. You're so right, this light citrus dressing complimented the spicey flavor of the arugula so nicely. Thanks for a great lunch!!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe.  It just seemed kind of bland.  I thought it would be much better, it sounded so good.  I was disappointed but didn't know how to jazz it up.

This was too sweet of a salad for me so I can't rate this based on my personal tastes because I'm so picky when it comes to salads but my mom who likes almost any salad said that it lacked pizazz or flavor.

I made this salad for family and friends.  This was our first time eating arugula and the dressing was superb.  I did not have any grapefruit so I used only orange juice and used apple instead of pears.  We also added cranberries.  This salad was superb.

A great introduction to arugula, whose peppery taste is offset by the sweet and citrusy dressing.  I used bottled juice instead of fresh and it still tastes great.

Arugula is pretty strong and an acquired taste.  I've never liked eating it until I made this recipe.  The dressing and pear balance out the flavors.  Add extra pear if the bitterness of the arugula is still a bit much.  My husband liked it and wants me to make it again since we're trying to increase our consumption of "greens" and are tired of the same old salad combinations.

This was delicious! Fresh and light and perfect for the summer. I added feta cheese and toasted walnuts and was thrilled with the outcome.

My hubby and I loved this salad!  I substituted grapefruit juice for the blood orange juice, added crumbled goat cheese and a handful of both sunflower seeds and dried cranberries.  Arugula is very easy to grow straight from seed in the garden and as a cold weather loving veggie, it can grow almost anywhere anytime.  Fresh from the garden can't be beat; just use scissors to cut a handful at the base of the plants and they grow right back!

This was good. It's a shame my pear was a little under-ripe, but I enjoyed it anyway. Can't wait to make this later in the summer with my own arugula. Thanks, Jeanette!

Very tasty.  Used fresh lemon juice instead of grapefruit and canola oil instead of olive oil.  Tasted great and will make again.

The dressing was bland.  Seeing as that is the key component, I was not impressed.

I worked with what I had. Red bib lettuce and red apple. I sauteed chicken sausage, then added diced onion, thin sliced bell pepper and thin diced red apple to the saute until lightly cooked (soft). I topped this on the lettuce and added the dressing and sliced almonds.  

I will repeat the process, but will use another dressing. One with more zing.

What a great surprise! This was better than anticipated. I needed an Italian salad sans cheese plus had a surplus of arugula. I made 1/3 recipe and used grapefruit vinaigrette, lemon juice, and orange juice.  I'll make this again this week. It goes together in a snap!

I added fresh lemon juice, julienned peppermint leaves and extra olive oil and quite a bit of fresh ground black pepper and walnut pieces. This makes the vinaigrette flavourful and irresistible,.. just one more bite...
