My teenage kids made these yesterday and they loved them. I sent them the email of the recipe and they made them on their own. I suggested soaking the slices in some cold water with lemon to help keep them from browning but make sure you pat them dry with a paper towel first; peanut butter doesn't spread well on a wet apple. They used homemade "granola" using corn flakes, raisins, coconut and jimmies-whatever they could find really. Great recipe for teaching kids to follow a recipe and clean up after themselves. Thank you experimental chef for the idea!
