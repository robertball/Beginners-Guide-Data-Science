The apples are an essential key to removing any "gamey" taste the roast might have had.  We made some alterations for a FANTASTIC pulled roast/stew  recipe....First we rubbed salt, pepper and crushed rosemary onto the roast.  Placed it into slowcooker with additions (onions, apple, loads of extra garlic), and let sit, covered, for about 10hours on low. In the morning, we added a 14oz can of beef broth, 1/2 bottle of Bell's Porter beer and a few chopped carrots and let it simmer until dinner time. NExt time we'll add a few more veggies to make the most DELICIOUS stew ever!  But, as it was, we thoroughly enjoyed it in a bowl served over some cheesy mashed potatoes with gravy (made from the stock).  Yum!

I have made venison roasts in a crockpot several times before, with different recipe variations, but they always came out dry and tasting like they were cooked in a crockpot. My husband LOVED this version; the roast stays moist and the flavor was so good. I will definitely recommend this to all the other hunter's wives I know!

Delicious!  I think the apples take away the gamey taste.  I omitted the oil and used one cup of beef broth in lieu of the hot water and bullion cube.  Simple yet very tastyâ€¦I will make it again but I will probably salt and pepper to the roast before cooking.

This recipe was simple and perfect for our needs. Even tho I tought it smelled funny when I first opened the crockpot, the meat was tender, juicy and tasty. I used one McIntosh apple, however next time I would use 2 of them - I love the apple bite and since they mush up, there is no chunks or need to remove them. I served it along with roasted garlic mashed potato.

This recipe was super simple.  I had a should roast with a small amount of fat on it, decided to add fresh mushrooms so I removed the roast (which was browning nicely) and sauteed mushrooms right in the crock pot.  I didn't even add bouillion, just the water.  I regret not taking a picture, it was very appetizing to look at.  Meat was tender and moist.  I will definitely share this recipe with my son who gave me the venison.

This is a real keeper! I have never like venison before but this recipe changed that.  It was just like having a beed roast.
I did add all of the ingredients at once and put it on low and let it cook for about 8 hours.
Thank you the apple were magical...

This was excellent. My husband is a steak and baked potatoe type of guy when it comes to his venison. He LOVED this though. The longer it cooked the more tender it was, at 6 hours it was still a little tough for my liking. At 8 it was perfect. The gravy was also fab over mashed potatoes! I rubbed the roast down with salt and pepper also before roasting.

This is wonderful!  I have made it several times and it always turns out delicious!  It's sooo easy too!   I usually add chunked carrots, and they are a great addition!  I also always make mashed potatos as a side. MMM!

Great recipe but I must admit I made a few changes.  I added 1C of red wine and 2 apples sliced in 8ths plus salt and pepper and 6 cloves of garlic to the crock pot.  I stirred the add ins every so often to get all of them in the "juice".  When it was done I removed the meat and sliced it but did NOT remove the apple and did not add any bouillon, just 1/2 cup of water.  I then took my Smart Stick and put it right in the crock pot and blended everything.  It made a wonderful gravy!!  Put the meat back in to keep warm until I served it with the garlic mashed potatoes and zucchini.  I cooked my potatoes with garlic in chicken broth and after dumping some of the broth whipped them with the rest.  No cream, no butter.  Really good and a lot less calories!  Can't wait to make this again and neither can my husband!

great recipe!  One point: as long as it is processed quickly and does not contain even a sliver of fat (which is rancid, on a deer), it will never be "gamey."
However, you should not expect it to taste like beef, veal, pork etc. since it does have it's own unique flavor; thanks, again, for a great recipe

This recipe was great. The venison was tender and tasty. I did change it a bit. I coated the venison roast in Montreal seasoning and braised it prior to placing it in the crock pot. Then once the roast was done I strained half of the stock and mixed it with flour, to make a gravy, which turned out to be the hit of our meal. The gravy was great on the meat, mashed potatoes, rolls anything my family could "mop up" with that gravy, they did... Thanks so much for this recipe

This is a keeper- however I have always removed all fat from the venison and found that it doesn't have the GAMEY taste left. I also use apple juice with the roast and stew and just cover the meat with the apple juice...As we have alot of venison each year-it is always nice to get new recipes---Thank-you

This was good, double the beef broth, Cover and I mean cover with apples and onions. I made it with double the broth and I made it with 1 can broth and 2 cups apple juice both ways are really good. If it was dry for you it could be one of two reasons, not enough broth or Deer was too old. The older you get the tougher you are. LOL

It was the best deer roast I have ever made. I used a Granny Smith apple and it made the deer sweet but tart. I will use this recipe again and again.

I just made this,  I waited too long to start in crock pot so I baked in oven,  Stated at 450 for 15 minutes and then turned heat down to 350 for one hour.  This was awesome, had good flavor and tender.  The apples was the secret,  No gamey taste at all.  Thanks for the recipe,  next time I will use slow cooker think it would be much more tender if I had cooked this way.

I made this and was not impressed by the flavor. Thoght the meat was tender it was missing something even more than the salt and pepper I added to the roast.I will try again maybe I will add some grond clove and cidar vinegar.

I had never made deer before, and I loved this recipe.  I did add half a can of beef broth, some fresh mushrooms, and I did two apples instead of one.  I put it over mashed potatoes like someone else said to...and my family loved it.  It was very tender and reminded me so much of beef, but was richer and better :)  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the BOMB! The only things I added were a splash of Balsamic vinegar and some lemon pepper. I too took the roast out and made gravy in a sauce pan for mashed potatoes. Unbelievable.

Didn't care for this recipe.  The roast was dry (not enough juice to cover the roast).  The gravy had a weird taste.  Although I must admit it smelled wonderful as it was cooking...the smell did not match the taste.  Definitely missing something...taste.  It didn't have any flavor.  We eat venison all the time, so I was disappointed this one didn't work out.  Definitely won't be making this one again.  Sorry.

Let me preface my comments by saying that my husband is a HUGE deer hunter and our family LOVES venison--fried, grilled, as sausage . . . you name it.

I gave this recipe 2 stars because it is edible.  However, that's the kindest thing I coan say about it.

Despite the fact that the onion and apple and venison made a lot of juices, the meat was most definitely NOT falling of the bone tender--nor did it have any flavor, notwithstanding the fact that I used an additional apple, Cajun seasoning and balsamic vinegar.

the apples really work to take out the gamey flavor of the venison!  i cooked the roast for about 10 hours.. we have used it for mulitple dishes - over rice with veggies, as taco meat for street tacos, in egg scramble... love this recipe!

This was an exceptional recipe! Only my second time cooking venison with the first time being a flop, I was pretty hesitant. However, without having apples I used about a 1/2 of apple juice. And, it turned out extremely well!!!

A good way to make a venison roast... we are use to the "gamey" taste so it doesn't bother us... this recipe worked well... I served it over noodles... but it was too juicey... next time i will try over mashed potatoes to soak up the juice... the meat tasted good though... next time I will season it with atleast salt and pepper... and it was super super easy to make

I've tried this recipe many times in the original way and also with some of the suggested changes it always comes out well. I love slow cooker venison because I need to find ways to cook the gamey taste out of the meat. And because I don't buy beef its all we have in the freezer. Thanks for sharing.

DEFINATELY COOK ON LOW!!!! My roast was dried out cuz 4 hours on low it looked like it wasn't cooking, so I increased the heat and forgot to lower it again.LOL The flavor was great though. I rubbed the roast with brown sugar, salt,pepper and garlic powder first.  I made the sauce to go over it as directed and didn't need to add any further seasonings.  Will be MUCH better next time.  My husband and kids ate it and had no idea it was deer.  GOOD JOB MOM

My husband thought it was great. "Best venison he had every tasted."  My one year old and three year old loved it too.  defiantly saving this one.  The venison was very tender and wasn't overly gamey.

This is omg amazing! My boyfriend works graveyard, so I had dinner by myself while he was sleeping. I was so tempted to eat the whole roast and leave him just a taste. I only had a 1.5 lb. roast and it still turned out amazing. No gamey taste and very tender. I didn't have any beef bouillon so I just added the water and a little bit of flour to make the gravy. I did salt and pepper my roast, but other than that I followed the recipe.

I didn't use any beef bouillon.  Added a second apple along with twice the garlic and plenty of Rosemary and Thyme(~20 springs and ~10 springs, respectively), and about a tsp. each of garlic powder, chile powder, and crushed chillies. The end result was fantastic, and the drippings made an excellent gravy with some additional salt and thickener (I used arrowroot).

This recipe was easy to prepare. I added salt and pepper to the meat and also a bit of thyme. The sauve turned out really well and had good flavor. It was delicious to eat over egg noodles. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the meat. While it did come out tender and not dry, it was very gamey- to the point that I didn't eat it. I don't think this is a flaw of the recipe, more likely of the meat. (not sure how long it had been in the freezer) I think I'll try this again with a pork roast.

I am stumped as to why this did not turn out for me. I made it exactly as written, but it was as if I had just cooked it with garlic and onion. The apple completely disappeared. Made no difference for the roast at all. For the 'sauce', I added some gravy thickener to the juices instead of bouillon and water, just to make a nice thick gravy.

Very good!  I made this as directed except at the end I made some modifications.  I removed the roast from the slow cooker & shredded it.  I discarded the apples but not the onions.  I whisked one can of cream of mushroom soup into the juices and heated.  I then tossed the meat w/the sauce and it was wonderful!!!  I served it with veggies & baked yams.  It would also be very good on sandwich rolls.  This is definately a keeper!  Thank you!

So delicious!  It didn't taste gamey at all.  I didn't have the beef bouillion, so I strained the juices out of the crock pot.  Fabulous!  I added a little sugar to the juices before serving and it was heaven!  I could barely cut it since it was so tender.  It just fell apart.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours and then low for 1.  My 11 month old ate it up, as did my 7 and 6 year olds, husband and myself.  Definitely a keeper! **Just wanted to add that I made it again the following week with applesauce instead of the apple and it was just as delicious!

Finally I tried this recipe and my husband and I were a little skeptical when we jad our first taste on the meat without the sauce. We changed our minds after adding it. It was simply delicious! I added some apple sauce on top of fresh apples and followed the rest of the instructions. We had great sauce for the roast but next time I will peel the skin off the apple before cooking as it was a little messing when I removed it after cooking, and blend onion and garlic and mix with the apple sauce to make the finish texture smoother. An absolute great recipe especially when you have time constrain and want to prepare a nice, decent meal. Definitely will make it again!

This is awesome.  The only thing you have to watch is not to overcook.  I had a 3 pound roast, including some bone, and I cooked it 6 hours.  I also thickened the juice a little with a flour and water mix.

This review is based on my husbands option as I do not eat venison.  He loved it. I had two small roast, so I put them both in the crockpot.  He said the meat was so tender and had lots of flavor. It did slice up very nicely and held it's shape.  I served this over white rice with the gravy.  I made the gravy on the stove-top rather than the crockpot as I was in a hurry.  I had to add some WondraÂ® to get the gravy to thicken up.  DH liked this a lot and said to save the recipe to use again.

Pretty good recipe.  I am going to add a little soy sauce next time to add a little saltiness. The apple flavor was incredible with the venison.

This was so easy and turned out great.  I ended up cooking my roast a little longer about 8 hours on low but I had doubled the apple and added some extra garlic (my family cannot have too much garlic).  Everyone loved it even my hardest to please!

I had never cooked any game meats, and I had also never used my slow cooker... So I was afraid... very afraid!!!! And fortunately, this was lovely. I wish it had been colder outside because this meal deserved a hot fire and a chick flick! I did the first round overnight, and in the morning I added a bunch of veggies, celery, potatoes, carrots, mushrooms... It was great. We ate it with crusty bread for the rest of the week!

I loved the apples in this! It definately masked the gamey taste that Venison roast usually has! 
I added a cup or two of broth in mine as apposed to the bouillion to keep it moist. I also used garlic powder, steak spice and pepper. Great recipe! Definately cook this one on low :)

Followed the recipe exactly, but substituted moose for venison.  Perhaps that was the problem?  It was okay and we ate it, but I don't think I'll be making this again.  The meat was slightly dry and the flavor was fine, but not fabulous.

Yummy.  Added 2 Cortland Apple slices.  I also added the beef broth right at the beginning too.  I served over baby red smashed potatoes and was delish! Everyone ate it including my 2 year old (4 year old wouldn't touch it).

This was fabulous. I added some corn starch late in the cooking to make the gravy a little thicker.  Served over mashed potatoes, it was a great meal.

This was tasty and a great way to prepare venison. I have others I like slightly better but I'll use this on occasion for a gamier piece of meat.

Excellent way to prepare venison. Normally venison is too gamey for my liking but the apple worked perfectly to mask the  gameyness. Meat turned out extremely tender and the sauce went well with mashed potatoes. I added a bit more apple and rubbed the meat with salt, pepper and rosemary prior to cooking. Next time I plan on adding a bit of maple syrup or apple juice to the roast for a little extra flavor.

This is an excellent recipe for the  venison stored in my freezer!  Loved the idea of the apples.  This roast came out so moist and tasted just like a beef roast.  Left this in the slow cooker for 10hrs on low.  I did rub salt and pepper on the roast and added extra garlic.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for a great recipe.

very, very good and really easy!  my husband is an avid hunter and gave this a big thumbs up, he absolutely loved it and I enjoyed it too. It makes for a great leftover sandwich too.  I used the suggestion of beef broth instead of a boullion cube and water. I will definitely make this again!

Just finished eating this lovely roast.  Definitely needs the gravy (tried it without the sauce and it was dry)I was pleasantly surprised that apple gravy would be so delicious!  We ate it alongside mashed yams and potatos.  Delicious and happy to have a different recipe for our freezer full of venison.

I've never had deer roast so tender.  It was falling apart when I tried to take it out of the cooker.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers.  I cooked the roast, apples, and onions overnite in the crockpot (about 10 hrs) on low.  Then added frozen veggies with broth and cheap regular beer.  Most excellent!

I prepared this recipe and added one little item.  I used steak seasoning peppers and rubbed them into the roast. Added all the other ingredients and placed it in the crock pot with the apples.  Family went crazy over this and so did their bosses...This is the best tasting roast I have had in a long time and I thank you for the idea of the apples.  It made the difference.

Very tasty.  I was worried that the roast would be a little dry but it had a great texture.  I feel that it would be better with a touch of red wine in the crock while cooking.  I made gravy in the crock as well after removing the roast.  Instead of cornstarch of flour I used potatoe flakes as the thickener.

This is awesome, best crockpot venison  roast I ever had, easiest too! Usually I follow a recipe to the T 1st time trying it, but, with this, the sauce was to thin so I omitted the C of water & poured the juice in a sauce pan and made gravy. Excellent!!

The apples and onions removed any trace of gaminess. Everyone loved it! What a great way to have venison without drowning it in soup gravy or having to brine it!

We just moved to an area where wild game is plentiful, and a friend gave us a couple of venison roasts.  I really didn't know what to do with them, but I found this recipe.  Tried it yesterday and it was extraordinarily tender!  Even my finicky seven year old liked it.  Will definitely try it again but will add more salt, and read the other reviews for expert advice.  Thanks!

This recipe is amazing.  I made it for Easter dinner and it was a real success.  I changed it up slightly in that I added a drizzle of balsamic vinegar at the beginning, and I put the cooker on high for the first hour and low for the rest.  I had it in the for a little under 7 hours total.  When I took it out of the crock pot, it didn't look so good, and I was pretty worried - it looked pretty dry and tough.  But when we cut into it it was tender and juicy, and the flavor was fabulous. The gravy made from the cooking juices was crazy good.  I've never been one to sop up the gravy with my bread, but I couldn't help myself this time. I'm extremely pleased with this recipe and will definitely be saving it for the future.

I didn't have any venison roasts, so I ended up using 2 or 3 tenderloins. This recipe took a nice piece of meat and turned it tough. It didn't have any scent while cooking and there was no apple flavor.

This is the best recipe I have found for deer meat.  You must keep in the slowcooker for at least twelve hours for it to become tender.  I never liked deer roast until now, even my four year old granddaughter loved it!

The apple really made a difference in the flavor of the roast, it was very tasty.  I did use twice as much broth, half went in the crockpot with the roast to keep it moist and the other half was used for gravy.

I've been looking for recipes for venison. This was the best so far, but still not wonderful. The loin I used was still tough after cooking in a crockpot on low for 8 hours. The broth it made was very good.

This recipe is wonderful!!  We're not big roast fans as a rule, but my husband is an avid hunter and brought home some this year.  This is a great way to make it - very flavorful, and it smells great while it's cooking!

Needs salt/pepper and additonal bouillon cube.  Not as tasty as I would have liked, but easy dish to prepare.

Made it per the directions.  Meat was tender, so thatâ€™s really what would destroy a roast. But there wasnâ€™t much overall flavor to the whole thing.  Something would need to change if this is going to be made more tasteful.

Decent start, but  could use more. I'll be adding a rosemary and sage rub, and some beer to keep the roast more moist. It wasn't BAD, just a touch plain. Sadly I start it at 6am and was groggy so didn't think to add onto the recipe.

It turned out better than I had expected.  The gravy that it made was great but I did thicken it a little bit.  I also did saute the onions and seared the meat before putting into the slow cooker.  Will definitely make this again and again.

I had never cooked a venison roast before.  Per another suggestion I marinated the roast overnight in tomato juice (which was then discarded) to remove gaminess.  I also added chunked up rutabaga and turnips to the crock pot.  The gravy was absolutely delicious.  I used Better than Bouillon beef concentrate and thickened it with a little xanthan gum.  My family loved all of it even though none of us had ever eaten venison roast, rutabaga or turnips.  While the roast itself was a bit dry, it was extremely tender and the gravy provided plenty of moisture.  Next time I plan to add a cup of water to the pot at the beginning, so that there will be more juice for gravy.

DO NOT MAKE THIS DISH!  This was a total waste of a good venison roast.  It was dry and hard.  The apples added nothing to the dish and adding bouillion to water and drippings do not make a sauce or gravy, which is necessary to make the dish edible. DO NOT MAKE THIS DISH!

I rubbed sea salt, freshly ground pepper and marjoram on the roast before placing it in the olive rubbed crock pot, then followed the recipe as is. I cooked a smaller roast on high for 3 1/2 hours (cook venison to at least 160 degrees).  Venison is a lean meat and will be dryer than beef, so the bullion broth adds moisture to the dinner for serving.

I think our roast was closer to 4 pounds so I used 1.5 granyy smith apples and extra garlic.  Cooked on high for around 4 hours then added carrots to the top.  Cooked 5 more hours or so.  The meat alone was a little dry but no different than past rump venison roasts.  With a little of the sauce over the top it is delicious.  The carrots turned out very tasty (scooped them out before the roast) and had mashed potatoes..... covered the meat, carrots and potatoes in the sauce and it was wonderful.  Not gamey at all, a hint of sweetness from the apple.  Very pleased, thanks!

I used this as a guide to cook a deer tenderloin in the oven.  2 hours at 275â€¢F with a thin layer off apples and onions on the top and bottom of the deer and a bit of beef broth to cover the bottom of the pan.  Covered in foil.  Wow.  This will be the method I use EVERY TIME.  My hubby enjoys hunting but I'm not the biggest deer fan. This is a win - win recipe for us.  It doesn't taste as gamey.  I am actually excited to make it again!

The apples took the "game" taste completely out! Usually I only have a small portion of venison because of the gamey taste but for this dish I went back for seconds (and thirds)! Very pleased with how this turned out.

The only downside was in trying to remove the apples. The apples became mushy and fell apart quickly, so removing all the apple pieces was close to impossible.

My first time to try a venison roast.  I doubled the amount of apples & onions to ensure the entire roast was covered. It was delicious, not a bit dry. My husband bragged about it at work, now sharing the recipe with others, including his boss!

This is delicious! With my husband and step-son hunting venison each year, I've got a freezer full and am always looking for new ideas.
the author is right - the apple does something magical to the taste of the meat.
I didn't thaw the meat. I just took it out of the freezer in the morning and cooked it that way. Super easy.
I used garlic powder and sprinkled it on both sides.
I put half the onion slices on the bottom of the crock pot and then the meat then the apple slices then the remaining onion rings. I let mine go 9-10 hours. I also threw in some baby carrots, just around the edges. DELISH and so tender!! We loved it, and in fact, I have it in the crock pot even as I type.

Venison roast is always a challenge to keep moist, but this recipe works well. My roast was small, a little over 1 pound, so I cut the beef broth in half and cooked only 4 hours (it could have gone longer, but was done). I seared the roast in olive oil before putting it in the crockpot. Made great gravy.

We used a few different cuts of venison and they all came out very tender and delicious. Really easy recipe. Added carrots and when we make it next time I will add potatoes to the mix. Delicious and entire family enjoyed it.

Best venison roast I've ever made.  Flavorful, tender and perfect.  Will make this again.

This was my first foray into venison. It had an odd flavor while also quite bland.

My dad gave me a venison roast and I had no idea what to do with it. This recipe was pretty good--the meat fell off the bone and was tasty.
