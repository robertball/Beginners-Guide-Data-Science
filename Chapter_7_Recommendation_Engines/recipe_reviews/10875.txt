I made these cookies for a Spanish Club party, and all my friends loved them. I thought they kind of tasted like a corn bread cookie. My Spanish teacher thought they tasted the "pan de muertos" or dead bread, the bread traditionally eaten on the day of the dead.  They took a little while to make, but I cut them into stars, which probably took longer.  I would reccommend these cookies.

This is a wonderful recipe to work with.  The dough is a great consistency, rolls well and holds the shape when baked.    I used all shortening instead of margarine.  And when I make my second batch I will use 2 tsp anise and no vanilla, as the flavor was more mild than I expected after smelling/tasting the dough.  Fantastic rolled in sugar/cinnamon.  Baked it has a nice crispy without being crunchy texture.    I also got 96 cookies with one batch, so more than 3 dozen!  I used 2 1/2 inch cookie cutters.
