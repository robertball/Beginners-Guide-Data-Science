I did not make these but I do make taquitos all the time and if you are finding that they shells are breaking try to do them in batches. I heat my corn shells 3-4  at a time with the wet paper towel or in a microwavable dish with a lid and I keep them covered between rolling each shell so they stay warm an moist. I hope this helps anyone having an issue with the shells breaking

I did not make any changes to the recipe and I will definitely make this again.  After baking, I put them in a crock pot to stay warm and took to a party.  Everyone loved them!  In my microwave, it took about 40 seconds for 2 tortillas to become warm enough to wrap without cracking.  I could wrap 2 while 2 were heating...  I used wet but not dripping paper towels under, between and on top.

I would love to give this recipe 5 stars because the flavor is spot on.  The filling tastes similar to the stuff you get in the frozen aisle, except even tastier and a lot more fresh!  I followed the recipe exactly, using shredded rotisserie chicken to save time.  However, I had a problem with the sides of the tortillas splitting.  In my first batch, the sides of every taquito split open, although luckily the contents stayed mostly intact.  I made a second batch and doused them with cooking spray this time, and I still had 80% of them split on the sides during baking.  While they were still tasty, this was a presentation issue, as well as a little bit of a texture issue with the exposed filling becoming a little dry.  Next time I will try flour tortillas to see if that helps.

After reading the reviews, I decided to fry the tortillas in oil to warm them up and soften them. I sautéed diced onion, red and yellow peppers,  and jalapeños and added Ro*tel tomatoes.  I only baked these for 5-6 minutes to melt the cheese. None of the tortillas cracked:) This is s good recipe that you can alter to taste.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This was a very good simple recipe.  I used a rotisserie chicken and shredded it beforehand so I was able to throw this all together in about 20 minutes, and that includes rolling them.  I think Id like to add more cheese next time though.  The tomato chunks were a bit too large for my picky 5 year old but my 2 year old loved them.  Maybe next time ill blend some of the veggies down a bit

I loved this recipe! I added a little more chicken than called for, and I blended the tomatoes and chiles all together since my children won't eat them if they see them. They gobbled these right up! Will be adding this to our staple meals.

This recipe was fantastic! I had to make some modifications due to what was in my pantry. I used black eyed peas instead of black beans, diced jalapeños instead of green chilies and flour tortillas instead of corn. (We don't really enjoy the corn anyways) This recipe was super easy and quick to make. The hardest part was waiting for them to come out of the oven! I topped them with more cheese before they cooled and then served them with sour cream mixed with cumin and chili powder. AAAAAAAMAZING!!!

These were excellent! I did not add the black beans or tomatoes only because my fiancée does not like them. But were still amazing. The only problem I had was the tortillas. Being a novice cook, I did not understand the importance of keeping the tortillas warm, so I did have a few that split as I rolled them. So I do recommend keeping them warm as you roll them. Made a big difference. I will be making these again. We loved dipping them in salsa!

Didn't use any cheese and added bell pepper and I thought it was bland. I think I'm going to try adding enchilada sauce on top and shredded cheese.

I baked half in the oven and they were bland. The second half I fried them in some oil and it was a 100% complete change in taste for the better. I like things spicy so I added a little cayenne pepper. For me, In the future I would just change the Rotel from regular to hot.

Thank you so much!  I have been looking for a quick and easy way to soften the tortillas and your microwave suggestion is amazing!  I use my own chicken mixture because I require a low sodium mix.  I also change it up by making the chicken with sun dried tomatoes or tomato and basil to create a non-Mexican flavor.

Very tasty and full of flavor!! A couple of things that I didn’t use were the black beans and the corn tortillas. Instead I used flour tortilla wraps due to the fact that’s the only thing that I had on hand. I didn’t have any problems with the tortillas splitting. I microwaved my tortillas wrapped in wet paper towels and microwaved them for only 30 seconds. The flour tortillas came out lightly browned and crispy just the way I like them. I will definitely be adding these to my weeknight quick meals to make.

Love this recipe! I didn't  have rotel so I just used a can of diced tomatoes and 2 diced serrano peppers.  We love this much better than the freezer taquitos. We will be making this again and again.

This is a good start. I find the seasoning is lacking. I also find it funny that the basis for the recipe was to have "less processed food" and used proccessed canned items and processed shredded cheese.

I loved that this was dish quick, easy, tasty and healthier than store-bought taquitos.  I don't think I'll purchase taquitos in a box again.  My family and I enjoyed them.  However, I found the corn tortillas difficult to work with.  If they are not moistened, filled and rolled immediately they crack before placing in the oven and even while in the oven; making your presentation not-so-pretty.  We did enjoy the taste of the corn tortilla with this recipe, but I think I will try a flour tortilla next time.

I made this exactly according to your directions with the exception of using flour tortillas because that is what I had on hand. After filling the tortillas I brushed them with olive oil.  They came out crispy and delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

So delicious! Too bad I was in a hurry to cook and didn't read the reviews. I learned the hard way about the tortillas cracking. Will be making these many more times but will make sure the tortillas are microwaved a few at a time so they are hot enough that they won't crack.  I sauteed diced onion in olive oil. Then added the chicken from a leftover rotisserie chicken. I seasoned with cumin, garlic, & cayenne (tiny amt) I didn't have any Rotel so I put a big splash of salsa instead. I used what I had since this was a last minute meal. I also added more cheddar cheese than the recipe called for.  I was amazed at how excellent they turned out.  I think you can substitute many different things and it will be good.

These were a hit. I was concerned about the shells cracking and staying together so I only warmed two at a time under a very wet paper towel. They rolled no problem. Once they were all face down on the pan, I brushed a Mexican spike oil on them. They came out perfect. Not greasy, and not cracked. I followed the recipe pretty closely except we like heat so I added jalapeños. Will freeze a bunch next time for last minute appetizers. Thank you for an excellent recipe.

These were very good, a little dry. I used flour tortilla and had no problems with the filling. I sautéed 1 small diced onion then added the chicken and the remaining ingredients. Next time I am going to add a little more cheese to the filling and sautéed diced peppers. My husband and children (ages 1,  5 & 7) loved this dish!  I served this with sour cream, guacamole, diced tomatoes, diced red onion and corn. Definitely will make these again!! I want to try and freeze them for a quick week night meal.

Severely lacking in flavor, and corn tortillas all fell apart, even with microwaving individually and doing everything I could.  Really disappointing considering the reviews.

Thank you for sharing your recipe! My kids absolutely loved them. I used almost all the ingredients except I didnt have any black beans on hand but used Northern White Chili Beans instead. I think I prefer this over black beans but I would definitely try the black beans next time to see the difference. My picky 12yr old daughter went back for second and thirds! So thank you ????.

These turned out great! Instead of warning the tortillas with the paper towel, I heated them up individually in the microwave and filled them as soon as I pulled them out. I placed the filling on the far side of the tortilla and rolled from there over. Then I sprayed and baked. Very good!

Really tasty! I used mild and my 'it's too spicy' kids went back for seconds. I had one corn tortilla split, guessing wetting the paper towel before heating really helped.
