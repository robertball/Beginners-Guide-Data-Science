Fantastic chili, to my liking it's a wonderful blend of oregano, thyme and bay - very savory.  My wife cant handle spicy so I cut back on the black and cayenne pepper but I don't think really it changed the flavor.  this chili will make a great backyard barbecue side dish.

This was great and full of smoky flavor. The one thing that didn't work was 8 ounces of tomato sauce and 1 cup of water. There just wasn't enough liquid once you drain off all the beans. I ended up using the full bigger size can of tomato sauce and while some like a fork stand in their chili, I grew up with it being more soupy. I probably added more water than most would prefer but even then, it didn't lack in flavor. This was good on its own and didn't even need rice. Great flavor but it just needs more liquid to get everything incorporated.
