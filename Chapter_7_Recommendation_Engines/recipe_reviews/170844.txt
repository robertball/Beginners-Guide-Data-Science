I made this and followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used pepper jack but substituted mexican Cotija cheese for Feta (they are very similar cheeses).

I found the dip to be fairly bland to be honest.  Nothing really that tasty about it at all.  I wouldn't make it again.

Awesome!  Bunco was "mexican themed" last month and couldn't figure out what else to make, so I hit the internet.  (Who needs 5 7-layer mexican dips!!!???)  I typically don't care for white beans, OR bean dip for that matter, so made this hoping others would enjoy it.  The dip was fantastic!  The feta adds a lot.  I took the leftovers to my Dad's birthday cookout a few days later and everyone gobbled it up.  Definitely a different pot-luck recipe for the box!

This dip is great!  I don't have a blender or food processor, so I used a potato masher to mash it all up.  Used an extra 1/2 cup of cheese in the dip, and put a 1/2 cup on top and popped it in the oven for about 20 minutes.  My dip was verrrrrry runny (I don't know if that is because I didn't blend it), so next time I make it, I will probably scale the broth back to 1/4 to 1/3 cup.  I served it with homemade crostini, tomato slices from the garden, baby carrots, and bite-sized celery pieces.  Yummy!
