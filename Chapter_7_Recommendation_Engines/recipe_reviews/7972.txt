This is a really good recipe. It makes a caramel brown icing that is glossy and tastes like sugar babies. Make sure you have a thermometer. You have to work with it really quickly or it will harden up to a point where it will not spread. It does not harder up to the point of being candy. The good thing is that if you get a pot of boiling water beside you and a metal icing spatula, heat the spatula up in boiling water, dry it off before touching the cake with it, go over the lumps lightly and in one direction, you can get it smoothed off. So, get it on there the best you can and then use the previous method to fix any bumps. I definately will make this recipe again.

the taste was good. it was grainy. but the problem I had with it was when I started to put it on my cake, it kept falling off, it was more like molding putty than frosting, it was almost like a rubbery cookie dough

This recipe is just like my mother in law use to make very creamy and delicious. Will definitely make again.
