After reading the recipe over carefully, I knew I was going to have to make a couple of changes. 4 bell peppers to 4 potatoes is way too many bell peppers for our liking. I used half of a red bell and half of a green bell and that was perfect for us. The oil needs scaled back as well. Overall a good recipe with good flavor but I do feel the recipe needs some tweaks.
