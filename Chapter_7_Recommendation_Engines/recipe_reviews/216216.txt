These are fabulous!  I did not use the almonds just based on what my children would eat.  And I used lemon pie filling instead of making lemon curd.  Very refreshing and very easy!  I will definitely be making these for reunions, family events and holidays!  Thank you for sharing!!!

It took me a while to find, and really wasn't all that delicious. It was rather burnt, and a hassle to make.

I just made 2 batches of these for a bridal shower.  I was looking for something pretty to serve, and these were perfect.  I baked them in a slightly smaller pan than a 13x9 (it was a disposable-foil bake pan of about 8.5x12).  The crust was PERFECT, soft, chewy, just firm enough to hold and eat with your hands (these were on a 'finger food' dessert table).  The almond flavor in the crust is delicious with the lemon and raspberry flavors.  The topping is like a light lemon mousse.  Just so good.  I made the recipe exactly as stated, no adjustments needed.  I found pre-made lemon curd by the pie fillings in my grocery store, and it was a great shortcut over making it myself.  I many requests for the recipe, and many more compliments! And it didn't hurt that these bars looked so beautiful with the raspberries on top.  This will be my go-to recipe if I ever need to "wow" with a pretty dessert!

Just a note - I did not make this recipe.  But I did get to try the ones that a coworker made the other day. So while I can't say anything about process, I do know the combination of flavors was incredible.  She pointed me to this recipe and I plan on making it myself soon.
