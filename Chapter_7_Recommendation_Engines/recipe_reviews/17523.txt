This is my recipe and it was altered by the allrecipes staff. What you actually do is cook all these ingredients on the stove top and then add them to sterilized canning jars. Then the easiest way to can is to put these in quart jars, preheat oven at 170 and let cook for 2 hours and then turn off oven and open doors and
let cool naturally. As the jars cool they will pop and seal. Very amazing. Much simpler than a water bath and just as safe. You can only use this for fruit or tomatoes, not meat or vegetables. Remember if the jars don't pop they aren't sealed and you will have to toss that jar. However, I have yet to have this happen. They always seal. Enjoy

This is fantastic!  Wonderful taste!  If you make it in a crock pot though, remember to cut down on the water a little, as mine came out just a little bit runny.  That won't stop us from enjoying this great pie though!  I strained all the canned items before including them.  Once it was cured I baked it in a pie shell for 30 minutes at 350 F.
Don't let the idea of canning scare you away from a good recipe.  All you have to do to sterilize your jars is wash them in the dishwasher, then be sure not to touch the insides with anything that isn't sterile.  There are a lot of good resources on the web that can help you.

This was fabulous!  I made 1 pie right away and can't wait to taste it in a couple of months after it ages.  It was like a combination of cranberry and mincemeat, so I made a crumb topping for the top.  The recipe made 5 full quart sized jars and most of a sixth (which I then used right away).  I will be giving it away as gifts for the Holidays.

The recipe states that it makes 8 quarts, but I only got 6 1/2 quarts. And that is with adding 2 extra cups of gooseberries to the mix. Also, baking it in the oven for 30 minutes does not heat it up that much, so I wonder if I should have heated it in a pot on the stove. I am actually processing the jars right now as I speak. I have yet to taste it, as I plan to let it age 2-3 months for holiday cooking. But with the mix of ingredients that it has in it, it should be quite good.

Made the filling this afternoon.  it was very easy and tasted great.  I went through a half dozen spoons tasting it just while it was cooking, it was so good!  The filling recipe seems like it would be hard to mess up.  I was worried earlier that I was spending a lot of money on dried fruit just to have it come out bad, but thankfully it does not seem to be a concern.  I also agree with other comments - NUTS.COM does have very high quality product and quick delivery.  My only recipe change was replacing water with apple juice.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Linda!

This recipe is delicious! Mine had a lot of extra liquid, so I set it aside and canned it separately to use as a cordial in mixed drinks or mulled wine. I canâ€™t wait for it to age!
