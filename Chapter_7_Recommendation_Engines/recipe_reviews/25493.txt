This is a wonderful recipe. I, like a previous reviewer,
cringe at the idea of putting sugar in a pickled garlic
recipe (or any "pickled" recipe for that matter!). I
added 1 teaspoon mustard seed, 1 teaspoon celery
seed, and increased the red pepper flakes to 1
teaspoon (for extra kick), and it is "to die for!" I've
made this recipe with fresh dill (as the recipe called
for), fresh sage and fresh oregano, and they are all 
soooo delicious! A little tip, if you separate the garlic
into individual cloves, then put them into boiling water
for about 30 seconds, then put them into a bowl of
ice water, they are much easier to peel. Thank you
Delevangal for a wonderful recipe. Highly recommended!

"Died and gone to heaven" ... that's the only way to describe this dilled garlic recipe. Thank you, thank you! I am a great fan of anything pickled, and I am a great fan of garlic, but everything that I tasted in the "pickled garlic" world fell very short of my expectaions. I suppose the problem is that so many recipes call for sugar --- and that's just wrong! I mean sugar ... garlic ... ooooooooohh, no... But this is everything you want: a nice little zing with the cayenne, fresh dill. It's a lovely appetizer, and I can't think how many rave reviews I've had. If I could give you more than 5 stars I would.

Garlic heaven!!!  I made 2 pint jars from this recipe...one to serve at one of our "Beast Feasts" and one to enter in the Alabama National Fair this year.  I used 3 dried red peppers, a whole sprig of fresh dill, cracked black pepper and mustard seed suggested by one reviewer.  Turned out absolutely beautiful (for the Fair) and the guests at the Beast Feast really chowed down on the ones I served them.  I agree...sugar in a pickled recipe seems so wrong...and this one is delicious!!!  Waterbathed the jars for 10 minutes so refrigeration is not needed until after opened.  Update: this entry took 1st place in the dill pickle category!!!

I personally don't care for them, but love the smell!  I made a big jar of these for my Dad for Christmas, and he LOVES them!  He has dubbed them "Dragon's Teeth" since they turned blueish overnight.  (After a mild freak-out, we looked it up online and garlic naturally will turn blue or purple sometimes when exposed to acids.)  I used a teaspoon of Emeril's Essence as well as about half a teaspoon of straight cayenne powder.

Delicious, crunchy and spicy!   FYI to other reviewers, sugar is a preservative, so while it's not necessary, it's helpful.  It also brigns out the flavor of the garlic. I didn't have any cayenne so I put a dried Japanese chili pod in each jar.  Hot and delicious!

Outstanding! 
4 1/2 cups of vinegar was just barely enough for two pounds of garlic...Next time I'll probably use 5 cups.

Several of the reviews mentioned sugar. There's no sugar in this recipe. Those reviews should be moved to Laura's Pickled Garlic.  HOWEVER, I combined both recipes and the garlic lovers in my family really enjoyed them. I used garlic that had been already peeled.  LOL.  Also used whole peppercorns and more dill than called for by either recipe.  Also, I live at an elevation of 7200' so I did the waterbath method of canning for 30 minutes and they were wonderful.  Family didn't wait more than 24 hours before they started eating these pickles.

This is so easy & tasty.  Per the prior suggestions I did boil the garlic for 30 seconds and it was so easy to peal!  My boyfriend said these were great and he liked the bite to them

These are absolutely delicious. I halved the recipe and added three full heads of fresh dill and three little dried red chinese peppers. I've been nibbling on them since I popped them in the fridge three hours ago. By the time they're fully seasoned, I'm afraid I won't have any left to appreciate the true cured flavor. I even cheated and bought already peeled garlic. It doesn't get any easier. That previous reviewer was quite right. It's not a harsh, unpalatable garlic flavor. It does really mellow. Thank you so much!

This was incredible! The garlic remained crunchy, and had just enough kick to keep people satisfied. Whenever I open a jar, they are gone in minutes!

Very good! I made this recipe last summer and forgot to review it. I was actually scared to try the garlic, but the pickling really mellows it out. Thanks! :)

I don't know what I did wrong but I did not care for this recipe. I have no doubt that I somehow screwed it up. I make lots of things from here and love everything. I'm a HUGE garlic fan. I put it in EVERYTHING! Somehow, some of the garlic turned bright blue. Not sure what that was about and the taste was so bad I couldn't swallow it. I eat raw garlic, pealed, as is. I don't understand what I did wrong. Certainly not my favorite recipe.

Definately a hit at the office and the local nationals here in Germany love it.  I do cook the garlic briefly to speed up the process.  Either way, it's good!!!!

delicious flavor, but garlic still comes out mushy in the middle.  I guess I'll have to keep looking for a recipe where the garlic stays crisp.

I love the flavor, but two things happened that I was wondering how to deal with, so if anyone knows the answer, please help.

The garlic is very strong and 2 or so cloves on their own give me a heartburn. Is it seasonal problem (winter garlic) & could it be fixed by blanching garlic before pickling?

By whatever reason there are blue streaks on my garlic. Bright blue. Never remember that happening with my aunt's pickled garlic.

Thank you for this wonderful garlic recipe! I make it every 3 weeks or so and always have a few jars in the fridge.I am prone to colds but since eating garlic raw & pickled I have not gotten sick.I also love eating this recipe with artichoke hearts packed in brine.I also add sliced lemon to the jar to give it a crisp, tangy freshness.Yummy!!
