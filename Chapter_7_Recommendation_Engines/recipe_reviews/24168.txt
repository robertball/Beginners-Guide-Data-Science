This was a great recipe!!! I halved it because I wasn't sure if we would like it.We used our  favorite brand of hotdogs,can't get loose hotdogs here.The celery salt sprinkled over the sandwich is a must----it adds something,it really makes a difference,I didn't think it would LOL Thanks for sharing the recipe

Closest you will get without going down to Olneyville.  Great flavor.  Don't forget to add chopped raw onion, mustard, and celery salt for "one all the way".  Only thing I changed was to add ~ 12 oz of tomato sauce before simmering.

Wow! Just like our favorite Hot Weiner place in North Providence. Didn't change a thing. This is what RI New York System Weiners are s'posed to taste like. Wish I had a coffee cabinet. (Rhodese for coffee milkshake). Simmered on low for about 45 to 60 minutes. Stirred occaisionally. YUM!

These were great!! Def a lot cheaper to make them then to buy them. For those who don't live in RI they cost about $1.50 for a small wiener. My step-daughter said I should open a shack this summer and sell these, lol. The kids ate them just the dog and meat sauce. But my hubby and me ate ours "all the way" mustard, celery salt and onions! It would have been absolutely perfect if I had coffee syrup to make coffee milk. (i know what type of Rhode Islander am I not to have any in my fridge?!?) Wieners and coffee milk go perfect together!! YUMMY!!

I found this too dry to simmer for an hour, so I added a small can of tomato sauce. It made a big difference. I also added some crushed red pepper. We had steak and hot dogs on the grill, and my husband said he would rather have had just hot dogs, because the sauce is so good! We had them the next day, too.

I am not a Rhode Islander but i have eaten at Sam's New York System in N. Providence. Not sure on how to order it i was instructed to eat it "All the Way" which means mustard, onion celery salt and of course the NY System Sauce. I inhaled 4 of these things and even though i was stuffed i still wanted more. The moment i returned to Delaware I did a search on All Recipes and found this recipe. I couldnt tell the differance. Perfect Recipe. Thank you.

Too sweet, after being a Rhode Islander for 30 some odd years, I can taste the difference. I'm going to try a tomato paste rather than katchup in my next batch.

This is as fine a hot dog sauce as you'll find on the internet and I give it an additional 5 stars for ease of cooking. If you want a hot dog sauce that is easy, fast and suits everyone, you've found it! Great job, Nancy -- you bailed me out of a mess (ruined another recipe sauce that took 6 hours and wasn't nearly as good as this one anyway). I realize that this recipe was posted to yield a particular commercial sauce but I'll use this one as a base sauce, make a few changes, just to suit my own tastes in the future. Next time, I'll dice a real onion, use prepared mustard and increase (slightly) the catsup and worcestershire sauce. I'll probably add a diced green pepper too and jump the cooking time to 90 minutes, adding chicken stock as needed to keep it from scorching. Again, thanks so much for sharing you recipe, Nancy -- great stuff. Pat, the old Bone Man.

My entire family enjoyed this coney sauce! The only thing I did differently was cut the recipe in half and 
browned the meat with 1/4 cup of onion and 1/4 green pepper and I did omit the ginger. Terrific to freeze and keep for those "hot dog nights".

This recipe was really good.  I did need to add a small can of tomato sauce to make it a little thinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are great. I followed the recipe exactly, and my whole family devoured them. I will always make this amount, then freeze what's left over. I know that I am repeating what most people who have tryed this have said but DON'T
FORGET TO USE THE CELERY SALT BEFORE SERVING. Thank you Nancy, for a wonderful recipe.

okay...oddly enough I just watched an episode on one of the cooking shows where Guy Fieri went to this place and said they were the best dogs ever. I have never had them but love michigans and all sorts of chilli dogs so I was very interested. It showed them fixing them up the arm and all. I just want to say that this recipes seems diff. in some ways (than what the taping showed) the owner/manager was cooking diced onions in oil to start with, then added the meat and seasoning.....I am not really sure that there was any tomatoe product in the mix at all.  Not really sure but I am so curious about the recipe and the restaurant that I am gonna give it a go this afternoon! I think I will modify if based on what I saw on TV but then follow the rest of this recipe as stated (as in spices and probably the tomatoe product too). I will update later for anyone who cares to read!

I live in Rhode Island and I have enjoyed NY system hot wiener sauce for many years. This recipe uses too much ketchup. If I use it again I will cut the ketchup in half

This was really great coney sauce! I'm trying to replicate my favorite Greek coney sauce from the greek coney island places, and this is on the right track but still something is missing. Nice tangy flavor, not tomatoey. We all thought it needed more spice. I made this and another coney sauce and we had taste tests, we liked both but this was the winner. Thanks, this was great, we enjoyed our coneys!

this is the closet I've ever had to a real hot weiner. It's not a chili or a coney dog!!  Delicious from an Olneyville lover.  Must have onion and celery salt and mustard.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good, I too added a small can of tomato sauce. It was so much for the consitency as it was too lessen the sweetness of the ketchup. It was a rather dry sauce, not much liquid to it, even after adding the tomato sauce but it had great flavor. I would certainly make it again but am still on the hunt for the kind of sauce I've been looking for. And I must say, the additional shake of celery salt on top of the dogs/sauce just before eating them, SUPERB!!

I made this as close as I could with the ingredients I had on hand.  It tasted good.   With only  1 lb. of hamburger.  I  didn't  have celery salt or garlic salt or onion salt .  So I subbed. 1 cup of onions  1teas. Of garlic  some of the spices I didn't want to put in  nutmeg or allspice this sounded like pie spices.    I put in tomato sauce   Not ketchup.    My husband loves to put hot sauce on his hot dogs. So he. Put some in his sauce.    This is a very good hot dog sauce. We will make this again.  Freezes well.   Always a good recipe for. Watching football games. Or a fast dinner.  Thank you.  Nancy    Carla T.

While the final product was great, it took a lot of adjusting to make it so.  I would say the hamburg is out of proportion to the other ingredients - maybe a typo?  As presented, the result does not even come close to the RI sauce.  I'd bet the hamburg should probably be in the 1 to 1/5 lb. range not 3.  Will definitely make it again, but not use 3 pounds of beef.

There wasn't enough liquid to simmer for the 1 hour so I added about 3/4 a cup of hot sauce.  This gave a spicier and thinner sauce.  Not what I remembered from back up in Jersey, but on the right track with the nutmeg and allspice.

I am from R.I. and this is it! The recipe I have been looking for! It makes alot so you can freeze leftovers. Make sure to use weiners not hot dogs and to steam them and the buns! Just like at Kip's from back home! Thanks!

Where I live in the midwest we don't have anything like this. I really liked it. The celery salt does add a great flavor. I did have to add extra ketchup, next time, I think I'll get rid of the ketchup altogether and use some tomato paste and water, help it not be so salty. We all ejoyed it, thanks for the recipe.

This is the best hot dog sauce I've ever made. I sauted some chopped onions with the ground beef, then once it was browned and drained, I put it in the food processor to get a finer texture to the meat. The only thing I skipped was the ginger. I added some extra catsup and a little water or it would have been too dry. The only change I might make next time is to substitute tomato sauce for 1/2 the catsup so it's not quite so sweet.

The only things I did differently was to omit the ginger, and I used prepared English mustard. We thought this was really tasty. Thanks!

Cut the Ketchup to 2 ounces and this tastes almost like Olneyville, add 1 tsp MSG  and 3/4 cup oil...yes a 3/4 cup (you use a slotted spoon to scoop it out after so most oil drips out), and then it tastes just like olneyville. But to get the consistency right just use your stick blender and blend till tiny crumbles. then let it simmer in the oil and grease for 40 minutes and that is it. I watch them make it before and they add that much oil, it is floating in it.  Do not grill your wiener, steam or boil it and only use reg yellow mustard for the true Olneyville experience. Oh and don't forget you must be at least buzzed if not drunk as that is the only way Rhode Islanders will eat these. I have never had one sober.

not that this recipe needs another 5 star rating but WOW is this good! I used ground pork as I always do in place of beef.  Added a chopped onion and used half ketchup and half tomato sauce (as many others did,I increased the tomato sauce slightly)I wonder how this would be as a sloppy joe or maybe a taco meat. I may need to try. Will let you know!

Oh Yum! I've been making this now for several years and can't believe I forgot to rate it. It doesn't matter what's on the menu for the cookout, someone always wants me to throw a few dogs on the grill also. They try to tell me it's for the little kids, but I know it's so they can have a coney. To make it easier on myself, I make batches of this throughout the summer and freeze it in varying amounts so I'm always ready for the next cookout.

This is a terrific wiener sauce.  We used onion/ garlic powder instead of onion/garlic salt and DID need to add a couple of extra ounces of ketchup because we felt the sauce was a little too thick.  We didn't simmer the full hour - maybe 30 minutes.  This recipe makes a very thick topping - which is what we've been looking for.  5 stars for taste and 5 stars for easiness.  Give this recipe a try.  You won't be disappointed!

I'm a happy camper!  I'm originally from RI, but I've been living in TX for 20 years.   I made this last night for a company pot luck today.  Since it was in honor of Memorial Day we were having hot dogs and picnic fixin's.   I  thought this would be great time to try this recipe.

This recipe brought right back to the NY System hot dogs I had in North Providence and Olneyville.   It was like a little mini trip back home.   The only way I changed the recipe was to let it cook and simmer in my slow cooker instead of on the stove.   Since I was going to bring it to work and keep it warm at work was in my slow cooker, I thought I might as well let it simmer in my crock pot.   I cooked it for 4 hours on high.  It took 3 hours on high just to heat it up and then I let it "simmer" for another hour.  It was great!  

BTW!  These poor souls in Texas had never heard of NY System hot dogs.   It was fun to introduce them to it.   They all loved it.   I made 5 pounds of this recipe and there wasn't any left over after lunch.  That about says it all!

I tried to just have one. Oh, I tried. But these are dangerously good. I'm glad I made the full recipe instead of halving it as I'd planned to do. Now I have an excuse to have these again in a few days.

A couple tips for you, cook your beef in 1 cup of water(2 cups for 2lbs, etc.) so you get that nice fine grind on your meat. But first, cook your onions down a bit first because you want the onion to dissolve into the sauce. So make them translucent before adding the beef and water.  Traditionally the beef is cooked in shortening , I don't like the flavor of vegetable shorting in this sauce so I cook everything in a half stick of butter and some avocado oil(DON'T use olive oil. veggi oil is fine if you prefer). after cooking your onions add everything else to the pan(beef, water, seasonings, all of it)Let this all simmer down for 1 hour on low. DO NOT DRAIN ANY FAT FROM THE PAN!. Leave it all! The hotdogs you use are important. Don't use regular everyday hotdogs like ballparks, they don't taste the same. What you want to use is the original dogs, if you can get them, but if not find the skinniest, thinnest "wiener"dogs you can find. Trim off the ends and cook them on low in shortening, if that's what you like or use the butter and oil. Trimming the ends is important because it allows the fat to penetrate the dog making the hotdog kinda mushy in texture(this is what you want). And lastly, Please, PLEASE! For the love of GOD! Don't use soy sauce, ketchup, or Worcester sauce in this sauce! YOU DO NOT NEED THEM!  There are NO tomato products what-so-ever in THIS style sauce, tomato products are used in Coney Island style sauces, NOT this sauce. The rest of the seasonings and spic

3.5.18  Gave a traditional chili dog a different twist today by turning it into a chili dog slider.  Followed the recipe to the letter, and have only one comment.  The chili mixture was dry, so I added a little more ketchup as well as some water.  Admittedly, I’ve never had a hot dog with wiener sauce in either Rhode Island or Massachusetts, but I liked this!  Quite a few ingredients for a chili sauce, but it tasted very good.

Many people here are right -- the original recipe (see below) doesn't include ketchup. Tried it with a mix of the spices here and the directions from Olneyville's NY System site, they were fantastic. Helps that I've lived in RI for over 35 yrs now -- I know what they taste like and can source the actual ingredients they listed. This was one of my dad's favorite local "cuisines". He would eat 12 at a time! Now they're $2 a piece -- so expensive.

 Don't forget to steam the buns! Makes a HUGE difference!

I was born and raised in Rhode Island, l have been living in Florida for the past 10 years and miss my NY System hot weiners. This is the closest to the original. I told my daughter about it (she has never had one, raised in Florida) she thought it sounded interesting and said l should try to make it. She LOVED it! She wanted to eat Weiner's for days until all the sauce was gone. Making it again tonight, l don't expect the sauce to last more than a few days. It has turned my not so crazy about Weiner's daughter into a loving them kind of person. Wish l could have her try the original, but sadly the restaurant isn't down here. Will definitely be making this for years to come. Thank you so much for sharing your receipe.

Delicious.  Very close to the New York System dog I had at the Big E last month.  Was missing the cumin, but will definitely make again!
