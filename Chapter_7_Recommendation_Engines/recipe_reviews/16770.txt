So, I made some changes to the recipe and the pie turned out ok... Taste is pretty good, but the crust didn't work so well (I didn't use enough butter). I added Splenda to the peanut butter mixture, about 2 T.; I also added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. I used the entire block of cc and about 3/4 of the jar of pb. To make the crust, I used my food processor to grind the Triscuts and melted the butter before I added it to the Triscut/pecan mixture. The taste of the filling is nice (with the added Splenda and vanilla), but when I served the pie, the crust fell apart. So it was more like peanut butter mousse with Triscut crumbs. I served with Redi-Whip, which added some sweetness. I think this could be a great pie, but the recipe definitely needs some tweeking. Hope this helps!
