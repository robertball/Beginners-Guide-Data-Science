My husband and I loved them, but I made the recipe into a drink, rather than a shot.  A full jigger of vanilla vodka, a full jigger of irish cream, 4 to 6 oz of rootbeer(I used diet),and lots of ice--soooo good!  We call them rootbeer floats, and its equally good with coke (again we used diet), for a coke float!

Was very good!  Made it for some friends at a party.  Make sure you only do 4oz of root beer because the carbonation makes it hard to chug!  I will definitly be making this again.

Pretty good. I made this as a drink rather than a shot so I didn't measure anything. Good flavor.

It did sort-of, kind-of resemble a root beer float, but the Irish cream didn't quite taste right. Cream or milk would have been better in place of the Irish Cream. Gently stir in the milk or cream based liquor after all the foam has settled.

We made several of these drinks on Christmas Eve. It's one of my new favorites. I agree with the review to keep paper towels handy for the overflow. Another thing I'd suggest is making sure the rootbeer is cold.

These are AWESOME. I recommend using rootbeer schnapps and increasing not only the flavor but the alcohol content.

We're all about getting drunk quick in this house!

Be careful, though. These are very addictive.

These are so much fun to make!  Learn from my mistake, though, and keep some paper towel handy to clean up the rootbeer that shoots out of the tumbler when you drop the shotglass in.  They really do taste like rootbeer floats.  Perfect for summer parties!

I don't think this really tastes like a root beer float -- the vanilla flavor isn't strong enough -- but it IS a yummy drink!  Be sure to use cold root beer!

Oh my goodness....talk about a great drink!!  It was a hit with everyone!  I'll be making this one again and again.  I did use diet root beer to cut down on the sweetness and it was delicious!
