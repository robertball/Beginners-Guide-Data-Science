This was outstanding! I had to make a few substitutions for things I didn't have onhand (I used lemon juice instead of lime juice, and I didn't have fresh basil so I used Emeril's Italian Essence). I made angel hair on the side & spooned some of the tomato mixture on that, too...heavenly! Thank you, Mister Glasser!

I loved this recipe, however, I changed/added to it a bit...

Because I read a complaint about the fish becoming soggy due to sitting in so much butter during cooking, I cooked all the garlic and butter in the same pot and just spooned a small bit of the mixture over the fish prior to cooking.  The fish still absorbed the garlic flavor, but it was not soggy at all.  I also used probably close to 3 tsp of garlic though.

Even though I used larger steaks (both were about 1 inch thick and 8 oz) the cooking time was still long enough.

The "sauce" ended up being WAY too much for just 2 steaks.  I think it probably would have been enough for 4 steaks, however, we ended up eating it all anyway.  I filled some pita bread with feta cheese, sliced olives, and the remaining sauce and it was delicious.  My husband and I both think that my pita bread creations were what really made the meal.

Wow!!! My boyfriend enjoyed this so much he volunteered to do the dishes for the next 2 weeks!  I used a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes instead of the fresh.  I'm headed back to the grocery store tonight to stock up on the Marlin while it's on sale.  This is a definate keeper. Thanks Jim!

I prepared the marlin and cooked it on a health grill for 10 minutes and it was absolutely mouth watering, melt in your mouth. I will definitely cook this again.

DH and I loved this recipe. I pan fried the Marlin first in the butter/garlic mixture, then grilled for the rest of the time. I added sun dried tomatoes and feta to the mix after and let simmer. I served it with greek salad and it was a hit! Thanks!

Awesome Recipe!!!!  Very flavorful and easy to prepare!  I added diced and sliced zucchini and it went very well with the existing ingredients! I served this dish with rice but I think it would go excellent with linguine.  This is the type of meal I would expect in a very nice restaurant.  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone!  As a matter of fact, I already have and her family fought over the last piece of fish!  This one is a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  I would imagine you could use it with pretty much any fish (especially white fishes).  Next time I will add more garlic-but only because I love a strong garlic flavor!

Very good and easy recipe to make with ingredients on hand. I spooned a little of the juice from the tomato/basil mixture over the fish before baking it as well. It made the fish very tender. Next time I think I will add some sugar to the tomatoes as they were a little sour.

YUM!  I used olive oil instead of the butter.  I also added a touch of white wine, scallions, salt and pepper to the tomato sauce.  I used swordfish and it cooked perfectly in about 8 min per side - moist and delicious.

I thought this was quite good. We may have had thicker swordfish steaks than others because we needed to cook ours a little longer before they'd flake easily.  And I have to say, don't waste your time with this if you're not going to serve it with the feta and the kalamata olives because all agreed that they totally made the dish. Otherwise, even with a boatload of fresh garlic and basil, we would have found it lacking.  Oh, and another note. Next time I make this I will simply broil or grill the swordfish and top with the tomato mixture. We didn't think the butter sauce added anything except unnecessary fat. Easy to skip and make this really healthy!!

I marinated the marlin steaks in the garlic/tomatoes/basil/lime juice overnight, and used olive oil instead of butter. The flavor wasn't as intense as I thought it might be, but it was very tasty none-the-less. I grilled them for about 15 mins each side (probably a tad too long). Great recipe! Thanks, Jim!

The recipe itself is quite quick and easy; the marlin was a bit tough; i'd recommend a bit more baking. Or maybe it's just the marlin?

Awesome sauce! I didn't have basil and used cilantro instead. Also, for the health conscience in me, I used olive oil and just a bit of butter. 
I also baked the fish in olive oil instead of butter, maybe thats why there wasn't much flavor in the fish, but the topping made up for it!

I used Swordfish, had 4oz fillets.  I think that spooning the butter mixture ontop of the fillets is a good idea to cut down the soggy consistency.  When you are using the fresh basil, the amount is measured in ounces, but this is not the weight.  If you use the weight versus the cup measurement, you will have way too much fresh basil.  Just an FYI.  Fantastic recipe.  Will make again.  May puree half of the tomato mixture to add to linguine next time.  I put the tomato mixture over linguine, and husband thought that pureeing it would be better for him.  I liked it unpureed on top of the DreamFields pasta.  =)

It's a great combination of flavors.  We were out of lime juice, so we substituted with lemon...  worked great.  We also sprinkled feta over the top after baking.  Delicious.  We used half the butter, which was more than plenty for four servings.  Thanks for this quick and easy recipe!

I tried this with less butter and more garlic (healthy folks are we), and I used the dried basil I had on hand -- my husband loved it over linguine, and it went great with my Greek salad.  Swordfish sometimes tastes too "fishy" to me, but this was delicious -- the lime and tomatoes really add.  Thanks for the great idea!

The sauce was amazing!!!   Don't know if it was my oven or the recipe, but 14 min was not enough cook time.  I will definately make this again, but I will bake for 10 min on each side.

The tomato mixture for the topping on the steaks was really yummy.  We weren't too thrilled with the texture of the steaks though, they got pretty soggy baking in the butter.  I think we might try grilling the steaks next time and then putting the tomato on top of the grilled fish.

Delicious! Never thought of mixing swordfish steaks, olives & feta cheese together - what an incredible recipe! Now I just need to figure out how long to cook the fish so it doesn't get overdone and tough.

Very good! We followed pretty close to the exact directions, except I omitted half the butter - really didn't need it. I also didn't have fresh but dried basil worked fine. Only problem was the cooking time - it took much longer than 14 minutes to bake. Definitely add the feta on top!

Not only was this delicious, but it is fast! We felt like we were eating out at a nice restaurant in the middle of the week. I served it over a blend of wild rices and the sauce really complimented the rice.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to try to cut the butter....It was delicious as is but not really very heart friendly.  But there will definitely be a next time.

Almost passed up this wonderful recipe because I am not a fan of Greek food but this seems more Italian since the feta and olives are not really part of the recipe. I used dried basil because that was all I had but it still came out perfect. Now our favorite topping for all fish steaks.

Absolutely loved it! My husband is the big cook in my family, but I tried this one out and suprised him with supper one night. He has been raving about it ever since! I served mine with steamed veggies and sprinkled the veggies with parmesan cheese. It turned out great with the fish.

We just brought home some marlin steaks from our stay in Cabo.  I wasn't sure about even attempting to cook them.  This recipe is amazing!  The sauce is so good you could eat it on cardboard!  All six of our kids-even the picky eaters loved it!  Thanks Jim.

When our fishmonger recommended trying Marlin ( which he said had more flavour than swordfish, but was more subtle than tuna), I was pleased to find this easy recipe.

To make it even more straight-forward, I melted all of the butter in 1 pot (rather than 2 as suggested), dipped the marlin in the mixture with a slotted spoon & then cooked them on a griddle pan (get the pan nice and hot, but turn the heat down to cook the fish). When it was cooked, I scooped the sauce over the fish to serve.

Thought this was an alright recipe.  I didn't have any tomatoes or even canned diced tomatoes in, so I left this out.  This may have changed the recipe quite a bit, but it was the flavor in the fish that was lacking.  I also used lemon juice, like some others, and otherwise followed the recipe.  I found that I had to cook the swordfish 10 min a side as others suggested, and it came out as somebody else said, a little tough.  It just wasn't as good as the marinade I buy at the store but was out of that day.  I will say, I did take the rest of the garlic, butter, basil, etc mixture, added a small amount of sugar as they would in pasta sauce (it was a bit too bitter) and added it to some pasta that I cooked up.  This was delicious!  Just the right mix of flavors.

I don't think I'm a swordfish person - we tried this recipe with swordfish steaks (as opposed to marlin) and the fish turned out kind of... tough.  Might have just been the fish though, and not the recipe.  or maybe that's just how swordfish is. The topping is REALLY good and smells amazing while you cook it.  I did not use enough fresh basil - I only had about half of what the recipe suggested, but I added about half a teaspoon of dried basil and it was still really good.  My boyfriend (who loves swordfish) absolutely LOVED this recipe and has been harrassing me to keep making it even though I wasn't a huge fan of it - still, it was decently good for me, so I give it 5 stars anyways as it's probably me and not the recipe.

Pretty good. Of course marlin is just good fish, and anything with so much butter in it will be tasty.

I did quite a few variations. I wanted extra sauce for some pasta I was cooking with it (penne Barilla Plus pasta (the stuff with extra protein & fiber added)), so I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes (Drained). I added the fresh basil (from my garden) the garlic & lime juice (eyeballed). Then I put in a dash of balsalmic vinegar. Also 1/4 cup of butter.

I salted the fish and seasoned with garlic powder then coated each side with flour, then milk, then a breading mixture I made of parmigiano reggiano (the real stuff), bread crumbs, and more fresh basil. I pan fried them about 10 minutes on each side in some olive oil. So I completely omitted the garlic/butter sauce part.

Then, after plating, I sprinkled it all with toasted slivered almonds (adds a nice crunch) and some grated parmigiano. Very good. Reasonably healthy. Too bad you can't eat marlin that often because of the mercury. And of course pregnant women not at all.

The recipe refers to both MARLIN and SWORDFISH.  They are different.  I made this with marlin and it was terrific!

I have never cooked fish but when I tried this recipe it came out so delicious. The tomato/basil mixture was great and when served it looked AND tasted like something you'd order from the Olive Garden! Thanks for the recipe!

Suggest using a cast iron skillet for the oven portion so as to brown the fish quickly without overcooking.

I made the recipe  pretty much as printed and it was very tasty. My fish was about 2" thick so I cooked it at 350 for 10 minutes on one side, bumped the heat to 375 for 10 minutes on the other side, then finished with 5 minutes on the first side again until it was done. I used half the amount of butter though and it was enough for us. As others noted, there was just enough butter/garlic mix to drizzle over the fish instead of it sitting in the butter.

Love, love, love this recipe.  Have just come back to find it to cook it again.  Tasty, easy and the whole family loved it.  I placed it on a kale and spinach salad garnished with feta and chopped up olives as suggested.  Sublime.

The sauce was better than expected. I used Italian diced canned tomatoes and the extra seasoning was perfect.  I made rice as well and used the extra sauce over my rice; it was divine. I will make this recipe again.

I used swordfish. This is a great recipe for the heavy white fish.  I think I'll pan sear first next time. We also added a bit of white wine and feta cheese.

My husband and I loved this.  I used fresh marlin, and based on some of the other reviews I served this over fettucine with some warm crusty bread to sop up the juices.  I considered adding capers, but we thought this was wonderful as is. I really wouldn't change a thing.  I might try with other types of fish, since we have a great variety of fresh fish in our area, but why mess with perfection?!

I also made substitutions based on what I had.  I used lemon instead of lime, cilantro instead of basil.  I also made this dish with brown rice and black beans so it was Mexican inspired.  Absolutely to die for!

This was pretty good. I didn't have any problem with it coming out mushy, In fact it Was Nice And Firm. The butter really does add alot flavor. The only thing I did add was some Greek seasoning sprinkled on each side. Thanks For The Recipe.

I made this with swordfish, and was very disappointed.  Maybe marlin would have worked better, a little confusing because the name of the recipe is marlin but the ingredients say swordfish.  Anyway, I used four mefium swordfish steaks, and cut back on the amount of butter used to bake the fish in, but it was still soggy.  Grilling the fish would have been much better.  For the tomato/basil mixture I replaced half of the butter with olive oil, if I tried again I would have used only a bit of olive oil.  There was too much basil for the tomatoes I used, I used three medium sized tomatoes, I think about half of the basil would have been enough.  When the tomato/basil mix starts to boil, instead of reducing the heat, I should have removed the pan from the heat- the basil was overcooked and overpowering.  I gave this three stars because my husband liked it, a good thing because there are lots of leftovers.

Wow, this was a really great way to serve fish! Since making fish is usually my way of trying to eat a little healthier, I made some changes to lower the fat slightly: I didn't make the second round of butter-garlic sauce to top the fish with. Instead, after the fish had cooked, I just spooned the mixture from the pan on top of it to serve. It was still very buttery. I also increased the butter and garlic and added a little black pepper to up the flavor since I was omitting the extra butter and garlic. Finally, I picked tilapia instead of the swordfish because it was what my market had fresh, but the slight sweetness of the tilapia ende up being a nice compliment. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

This was delicious. I used olive oil instead of butter. I didn't measure anything and think I used more garlic and less basil than called for. The tomato goes really good with the swordfish. It also goes great mixed in some brown rice and served on the side.

Delicious, first time trying swordfish and this recipe did it justice, my daughter just loved the topping,I did add a wee bit more garlic than it said, but it was good
