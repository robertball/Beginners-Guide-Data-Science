Overall, this tastes pretty good. I used chicken thighs with skin-on, because that's what I had on hand; and I also halved the recipe. It turned out pretty well that way--tasty, with a juicy interior, and crispy skin on the outside--yum! The only thing that I couldn't taste was the curry. I feel like it could be doubled at the very least, otherwise it gets lost in the honey-mustard flavor. I would also reserve the fresh tarragon for the end of the cooking time instead of putting it in at the beginning. Other than that, we enjoyed this! Thank you for the recipe!

I made a half-recipe, using boneless chicken thighs, cut off all visible fat and most of the skin.    I did brown the chicken before placing in the baking dish, which cut down on the baking time.  I also saved a bit of the sauce to brush on the chicken in the last 10 minutes of baking.  I made the oven-baked brown rice recipe on this site from blueberry_chica.  Since it is the same oven temp, it was all a matter of timing.  Added a salad.  Very happy with the results, DH went back for a second piece of chicken, and he's not a chicken fan.  A bit sweet from the honey, the curry was only a hint , no one ingredient was overwhelming.    Smelled great while baking.   Super simple to make. Will make again.
