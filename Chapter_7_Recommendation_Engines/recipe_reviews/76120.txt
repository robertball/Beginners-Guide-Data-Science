I can't believe in all my years of cooking I never thought to cook radishes.  These are fabulous!  If you like cooked cabbage, you'll love these.  If you don't, this may not win you over.  Like cabbage, radishes have a peppery bite to them, and it's pretty strong in those little red spheres.  But it practically disappears when they're cooked.  I've made this dish twice and here's my changes: halved the butter, halved the garlic (or else you'll miss out on the almost-sweetness that develops) and added about one tsp chicken boullion powder ('cause I like cabbage cooked in chicken broth).  Additionally, I cooked them on the stove on low in a covered skillet, stirring occasionally.  Also, I found that no additional salt or pepper was needed.  Hubby thought they were "just OK" and 6-yr-old wouldn't even look at them, but I know I'll be making these all the time.  How ideal that I can make just enough for me.

Okay, I admit it. I don't like radishes. In fact, when my produce delivery service delivered these this week I cringed inwardly. BUT I'd only had them raw on a salad so off I went looking for a way to cook them... and found... THIS.

I was amazed.. I like radishes now :) The garlic is just great... yum! Even my veggie-scared husband liked them! 

The only thing I did differently is that I didn't have time to do the grill packet thing, so I pan-grilled/fried them on the stove. 

I give it a 4 only because my son didn't like it ;)

These were amazing! I cooked them in a skillet on the stovetop over medium heat for the same 20 minute cooking time, rather than grilling them, due to the weather. I used the same and same amount of ingredients and seasoned with kosher salt and black pepper towards the end. I absolutely loved them and my 2 year old asked for seconds!

Pretty good. I'm giving this a four only because I didn't grill the radishes and it should be rated as the recipe states. Otherwise it would be a three and a half because I sauteed the vegies in a pan instead. No rave reviews from four out of five people, however, our daughter Ashley loved them! Hubby and I are crazy about radishes in the raw and I guess we just missed the bite they give off when not cooked. I have to say, I had no idea that radishes had any natural sugar. Much like onions, they become so amazingly sweet. If you're not a radish fan, I suggest trying this as you'll probably be pleasantly surprised. My "Ash-b-gash" thanks you "Librarylady" for a side she truly enjoyed!

This one gets 5 stars because I HATE radishes, but now I can eat them--and like them--thanks to this recipe. Like many other reviewers, I skipped the foil and cooked them in a pan with butter and garlic. The radishes are still crunchy, but all the bite and bitterness is gone. :)

I don't particularly care for radishes, but we received a bunch on our produce delivery and I was looking for a way to use them.  I never would have thought to cook a radish, but these were excellent!  They have a very mild taste, kind of a cross between a turnip and a potato, but don't have the mealy texture of a potato.  This will become a regular!

I'm a big fan of radishes and I have never tried cooking them before.
This recipe was pretty good. The radishes had a great texture and the tatse was good. 
But I found that it tatses almost exactly like cabbage and I forget I'm eating radishes.
If your not crazy about the spicy taste of radishes then i recommend this. 
But for those who love the flavor of radishes as I do, stick to the salads.

These were a bit weird. They really don't taste like radishes, although it's hard to say what they *do* taste like... Slightly cauliflower-y? Husband didn't like them at all. I ate a few and kind of enjoyed them, but I only finished about half my serving. Thanks anyway.

I was trying to think of something to do with radishes besides eat them raw because I truly dislike the spicy flavor of raw radishes! So I decided to saute them in butter with fresh minced garlic, salt and pepper...this worked PERFECTLY! The spicy flavor was gone! This tasted just like sauteed cauliflower but with the texture of pan fried potatoes! And I love the pretty mauve color! Then I saw this recipe which is almost exactly how I prpared them except I didn't grill them in foil packets and I didn't use any ice. This was less expensive than cauliflower. I'll be making this often! Great side dish for meat or can be served ontop of pasta!

I would never have thought to cook a radish and took a chance on this. My husband raved over this and ate all of them! The flavor was very good, this had a bit of a bite with the radish and the black pepper. I wasn't as impressed as my hubs was but it was a texture thing with me. The flavor was really great. Thanks for a wonderful idea and great recipe!

This was really good.  I would have never thought to grill radishes but with the addition of 2 chopped green onions and 1 tsp of chicken bullion granuals everyone in the family fought over the last slice of redish.  Thank you so much for this great way to use up all the excess radishes that always seem to ripen at the same time.

I loved the cooked radishes but it had too much garlic and I LOVE garlic. Next time I think I will just sprinkle with garlic salt.

Loved these!  Everyone I told this recipe to had no idea radishes could be cooked.  I roasted them in the oven since the oven wrapped inside tin foil with all the ingredients (didn't do the ice cube - forgot).  They came out soooo tender and sweet and garlicky - not sharp and spicy like raw radishes.  I cannot wait for leftovers tomorrow.

I tried this as the recipe is written.  It was super yummy.  It doesn't taste the way you expect it too.  It does taste more like cooked cabbage.  I will be making this again.

This recipe is yummy and something different to enjoy, I had to do it in the oven as I can't grill where I live, but it still was very good, outside of the cooking method, (400 degree oven for 25 mins) I followed the recipe exactly, and even my husband who was a little skeptical about it, said he likes it enough to have it again. Thanks for posting it!

These do take on a quality of cabbage when cooked! I was surprised as I have only ever had them raw on salads. I think I still like them better raw but this is a a really great way to get a variety of veggies in my dinners.   The recipe was REALLY easy and it tasted great. I don't think I could have messed this up if I tried. Thanks for making me think outside the box.

The only thing I would improve upon with this recipe is to maybe serve it topped with either roasted pecans or walnuts and perhaps a little Gruyere cheese to help round out the flavor and texture. Easy enough recipe though!

I'm a believer. Radishes are easy for kids to grow in a backyard garden so once we grew them, I had to find a way to use them. I tried this recipe exactly as-is and even my pickiest child asked for more! I think I'll go plant another few rows in the garden so we can use this recipe again.

WOW, if I could give this more stars I would.  Most of my garden radish crop ends up prepared this way. I don't normally eat that many radishes, but this recipe made me plant more.

I am not a good griller and was alone when I made this, so I made a smaller amount.  Plus, I did it in the microwave.  They were delicious!  They had a very delicate flavor, not a strong radishy flavor. I have never been a fan of radishes and have NEVER bought them before.  I only ate them if somebody else had put them into a salad.  I will definitely make this again!

Since you are putting an ice cube in the packet you're steaming them instead of grilling. Better to cut them in half, marinate and roast or grill directly

I didn't even know you could cook a radish, but after planting my vegetable garden, and being overrun with radishes, I started looking for ways to enjoy them.  This recipe is a winner.  I makes a great little side dish.  I boosted the garlic a tad, but my husband and I like more garlic in most things.  I'll be making this again for sure.  I still have a ton of radishes to harvest!

Reading these reviews is interesting.  People get different flavors from the radishes - I wonder if it's the radishes???  Ours reminded me of turnips,  my husband said "turnips but better."  This is worth trying you will never know otherwise.

Great idea for radishes; I learned I actually like them if I cook them. Like others I tried to make them on the stove. For some reason mine took forever to cook and got crispy/blackened. I didn't really like this and I think doing them on the grill would be better. Or baking them in foil in the oven, which I will try next. I thought the garlic was the perfect amount, since cooking the radishes cuts their 'bite' and the garlic brings it back.

This is a love it or leave it recipe : )  It was NOT bad, but I just didn't care for it.  I'm not a huge fan of radishes, but my husband loves them.  I would definitely give it a try if you have an abundance of radishes that would otherwise go to waste.  If you're lucky you may find a new favorite.  Thanks for sharing

Very good.  I'm surprised how much more mellow flavored they get when cooked.  I bought a bunch of raddishes for a salad and had the rest left over so I made these.  Will do that from now on.  Thanks!

I am giving this 5 stars.  I really dont eat radish but a friend of mines with a garden gave me tons of them so i had to find a way to cook them.  instead of grilling them i used a foil packet in the oven and i sliced some jalapenos inside.  it was very delish.....spicy but worth the try. my kids loved them

I was hesistant at first to try this, so only used a few radishes and adjusted the butter and garlic arccordingly, but still used a whole ice cube.  Turned out FANTASTIC!!  Neat way to use them.  They almost have bit of a baconie taste :)  Who doesn't like bacon

Made per recipe and came out as the comments suggested. I like raw radishes and this took too much flavor out. I will try in a grill basket or use them as part of a potato or mixed vegetable grilled side.

These were OK, and we're still on the fence--do we like radishes at all or not? If you don't care for raw radishes, leave out the black pepper and see how you like it. I did like the garlic and salt with them, but not the pepper. Cooked radishes, at least this way, seems to reduce their strong taste, but not enough for us--maybe it was the addition of the pepper. I'll try again one day I'm sure. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Takes the bite out of oversized radishes. We loved them. Found them to be very rich so I couldn't eat as many as I dished out for myself. I wouldn't change a thing.

Hallelujah, I found a way I enjoy radishes! I've never been a fan of the peppery nature of these round little devils, but I was delighted by how subtle that was once they were grilled. Of course, anything doused in butter and garlic is going to be tasty, but you can bet I'll be using this recipe again to get rid of the radishes in my CSA box!

My husband loves radishes and I was looking for something different to do with them. I used this recipe last night & it was a huge success! He said the same thing other people on here did, He had never thought of cooking them this way and it was fantastic. I didnt change anything  & it was perfect. Thank you .

Gotta say, other than sliced in salads, I never cared for radish. Then I tried this when my home delivered produce included a beautiful bunch of radishes. And...I loved it! The kids loved the 'pink' color the dish ended up with, and it was great alternative to scalloped potatoes or something similar. Amazing! I've sent the recipe to friends who were equally as impressed! Thanks for a great recipe!

Am not a big fan of radishes but after buying some at the farmer's market I was looking for a new way to eat them. Am so glad I found this recipe. After reading the reviews I got inspired to make my version of this: I sauteed the radishes with a big red onion, juice of half a lemon, 5 small cloves of garlic, 1 tbs butter, and 1 tbs olive oil. Also I sauteed some other veggies (sans butter) in batches: sweet corn (off the cob), a red bell pepper, adamame- in the meantime I was making the quinoa on the side. Once the quinoa & veggies were cool, I mixed them in a big bowl. Then I added a vinaigrette (olive oil, salt, black pepper, and oregano). I served them on top of lettuce and on top put some slices of avocado. A complete dinner! My husband and my 22 months old loved it. Next time I'll try the radishes on burgers. Yum, yum. Thanks for the recipe, it was truly inspiring.

This was a pretty unique recipe and we are always looking for new ways to use radishes. I feel like something is missing, but I think this recipe could be incredible. I love garlic, but the garlic was a little overpowering. We will make this again, but need to figure out something to add. Maybe another spice or we thought this might be good mixed with some other vegetables.

Radishes are very unique... if you don't like them raw chances are you're not going to care for them cooked either. My husband loves radishes and thought these were great, whereas I thought they were just okay.

This was surprisingly good. I had never heard of eating cooked radish until I saw this recipe. This is an easy, delicious, recipe and practially no clean up is needed. You definitely should change the salt, butter, and garlic to your liking or else it could be a bit bland to some.

I'm amazed that such a simple recipe is SOOOO good!  I did not have bbq materials on hand, so I sauted it.  Instead of butter, I used "I can't believe it's not butter" spray.  YUM!
