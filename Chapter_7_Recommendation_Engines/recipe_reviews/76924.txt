This was the hit of the desserts at last year's Christmas dinner.  I am back to reprint this wonderful recipe!  The meringue is nice and chewy. The whipped cream and berries is the perfect addition to it!  I had requests to make it again!  I should've made 2 last year!

I used strawberries instead of rasberries because I remember having something similar as a child made with sliced sweetened strawberries. It turned out great, though the juicier strawberries made it pretty messy.

I made this 2 days ago and served it today at our Christmas dinner and it was a HIT! I think it tastes better when it sits at least one day.  I served with a sprig of mint and frozen mixed berries. Looked beautiful and tasted great!

I made this recipe and it went over beautifully!  Added a few drops of red food colouring to turn the meringues pink.  Also made a raspberry coulis to pour over it.  I'll make this again, for sure.

I made this for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best dessert he's ever had!  It almost tasted better the second day.  I drizzled it with some semi-sweet chocolate (warmed up in the microwave) and it looked beautiful and tasted amazing.  I used raspberries and blueberries but next time I'll add strawberries and maybe even bananas.  The meringue was so easy to make, I loved that part!
