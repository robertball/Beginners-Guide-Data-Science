I love fried green tomatoes, and this recipe is great! The only recomendation that I would have would be to try adding some cayenne to the coating - it definately adds a zip to them.  Also, one reviewer mentioned that the coating was "thin" - that is a good thing!! That is how they are suppose to be so that you can taste the tomato! Try dipping these in buttermilk ranch dressing - sooo good - but not diet friendly :(

I have been making and eating fried green tomatoes for over 50 years and the only thing missing was sprinkling with a little sugar when you get through frying them. I takes them up to another level. PS. I am a Kentuckian

I loved this but put my own special twist. I fried a small eggplant along with and then layered the fried vegetables with tomatoe sauce, mozarella, parmesan and a little cottage cheese in my iron skillet then placed it all in the oven on 350 for 30 mins.

After living all of my 53 years in the south, I can honestly say this is the best and ONLY way to cook fried green tomatoes, in bacon grease. It's a southern tradition. These are great, I do add a little cajun seasoning and a dash of sugar, other than that, I don't change a thing. Everyone that I have ever made these for raved over them and during the months when tomatoes are in over abundance, I make these often. This is by far the very best recipe that any cook can make successfully.

Delicious!  My family loves 'em!  This is the kind of fried green tomatoes I was raised on in Virginia.  I agree that the only way to really appreciate this Southern side dish is to use bacon grease.

Loved it. I really like the taste of the tomatoes, so I cut them about a half inch thinck, rather than 1/4 inch.

This recipe is fair.  Nice color and texture but really lacking flavor - yes I used bacon grease.  Needs more kick in the dry coating... salt, paprika, cumin, ???

Having grown up truck patching and raising anywhere from 200 hills to 1500 hills of tomatoes to sale via my grandmother's country store and truck peddling (selling out of the back of a pickup truck), I have eaten my fair share of fired green tomatoes.  This recipe is just like what my mother did when she prepared them, which were delicious.  However, THINNER is the key to success in our family.  A good fried green tomatoe should be almost crispy.  The 1/4" or thicker cuts will result in the tomatoes getting soggy as they rest after cooking, which it a big turn off for us.  Try the 1/8" thickness for the tomatoes, but be careful not to over cook them.  They should turn golden brown and be almost a crispy like a potato chip!  That's how some of us in Western Kentucky do it, anyway.

I customized this great Southern recipe to make it gluten free using gluten free Bisquick instead of all-purpose flour and it worked beautifully! Made flavorful, crispy fried green tomatoes. And yes, I agree you MUST use bacon grease.

Great recipe.  You can stretch the bacon grease with a little lard if you don't have enough.  I always use sugar, sprinkling a bit on before the dredging in the flour.  My dad loved these- he ate them as a child in 1910!  Fond thought s of him when I eat these!

This is the only way to fry green tomatoes! I do however, take it up a notch by using buttermilk in stead of regular milk, and as others have suggested, a dash or two of cayenne with a sprinkle of sugar.

It was hard getting bacon grease so I used coconut oil and this may be why it was hard to get the picture-perfect ones shown. I also used some of the suggestions and it tastes good,(no salt?).

Didn't use cornmeal, just used eggs and flour. Fried them up in bacon grease and added some cajun seasoning for more flavor.

Enjoyed the years first bounty tonight!  I followed the recipe with one exception, I was out of bacon grease, used corn oil.  Next time I will definitely make sure to use the "bad" stuff, can't wait!

Native Alabamian and definitely agreement to fry in Bacon Grease, which every self respecting Southern cook has in a silver can in her fridge. Here are my few changes. I do cut them a wee bit thicker. I soak them in buttermilk. I add  some panko bread crumbs to the coating mix for extra crunch and mix some Red Robin seasoning into the mix or any kind of Seasoning salt mix. Yummo

Phenomenal!! These are even better than the ones we get at a hometown restaurant here in Ky.. The bacon grease really gives them the flavor, and I agree with another reveiwer who suggested sprinkling the sugar on them right after frying. We serve these with cocktail sauce. So glad I found this recipe.. Will use again and again!

Awesome recipe! I changed it up to suit my taste by using breadcrumbs instead of flour and added a bit of sea salt but that's just personal taste. Thanks so much! OH and I'm a Kentucky gal too! =)

So quick and easy to do... definitely a must to try for those who want to try different things but with less fuss. I'm not into tomatoes and yet I loved how this one looked and tasted. I used homegrown tomatoes, freshly harvested off my mom's little garden and I don't know if that made all the difference, but it was really good.

This is the basic recipe, we do a few things differently, we add hot sauce to the milk mixture for a little kick, then we double dip our tomatoes, first in flour to coat, then in the egg mixture, and then dip in the cornmeal and fry it up in bacon grease. Awesome!

As a Kentuckian, any recipe with Kentucky-style catches my eye.  These fgt's are spot-on.  I fried my bacon first, then used the same pan with the same grease to fry the tomatoes...then spread some mayo on bread, put it together and grill the whole thing!  YUM!!!!  I also use almost-red tomatoes, like them as well as green.

This is the same recipe my Kentucky born mom always used. I've added some changes over the years.  I slice my tomatoes quite thin then dip them in Olive Garden's Italian dressing (it's thicker than most) then into a mixture of half flour & half corn meal, sprinkle with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar on each slice. Fry 'em up nice & slow in a cast iron skillet in bacon grease til real crisp. Also, finely chopped onion & pre cooked bacon bits add a nice touch when they are almost done cooking. Scrumptious!

Not bad.  We don't have green tomatoes where I am so I had to make do with ripe tomatoes.  They came out crisp, but quickly softened.  I'm not sure if that's the right effect.  Still good, though slightly bland.

THESE ARE THE BEST!!! Not as good as granddad used to make. I saw a chef on OnDemand make FGT's and it took me back to my childhood and granddads FGT's. I was in the market and low and behold there were about 7 or 8 green tomatoes mixed in with the  red tomatoes on the vine...so I had to get them because fate put them there for me to find so I could re-live a small delicious part of my childhood (heeheehee). I tried this recipe because I didn't have cornmeal...and I realized you really don't need it. I also used bacon grease as others suggested...if you gon do it...you gotta do it right! :=)

I grew the tomatoes but didnt remember the proportions to combine, plus I have trouble gauging the seasoning to use in any frying batter. Good recipe for the dry mix but bland with no salt.  Used Tony's after cooking but it was Too Much - argh!  Pepper alone is definitely not enough seasoning in this recipe.

Like another reviewed said,  1/4" or thicker makes them soggy in oil. 

At first, by mistake, I mixed all ingredients together & got a thick batter.  Added some milk to thin, and the tomatoes I fried were quite good that way! Made a nice cornbread coating, almost a flat hush puppy with green tomato inside!  It was really pretty, moist cornbread. Perfectly golden  brown.  

Dont know which way I preferred, but there's something to be said for just going with a mistake to see where it takes you!

This is a good recipe, but I typically use a tiny sprinkle of salt and buttermilk instead of the regular milk, gives better flavor.

Cooked my first fried green tomatoes the other night using this recipe, and they tasted just like Mom's. I had my oven on 350 so I could keep the first batches warm as I continued to fry. So good!

Very good recipe. Frying in Lard is highly recommended. Also, fried green tomatoes didn't originate in the South. I was born in Charleston SC and raised in Lancaster SC. I grew up eating and cooking them and they have developed into a Southern dish, but they originated in the Northeast and Midwest.

A really good recipe. I love the flavor the bacon grease gives the tomatoes. I did add a few seasoning to my cornmeal/flour mixture that were not listed but overall a great recipe.

I made this recipe, except with zucchini rather than the tomatoes (my boyfriend isn't a fan of any tomato)I made it two ways, the recipe way and an Italian style alternative (The alternative replaced the cornmeal with Italian style Bread crumbs) Both were awesome and the one listed above tasted like a recipe I had at my friends grandma's house in Louisville. Great recipe!

I made this a few months ago when I had a ton of green 'maters in my garden.  I'd never had nor made Fried Green Tomatoes.  We really enjoyed them and I think this recipe probably makes THE best FGT's but it will not be one of our regular things.  Maybe once a year to say we did it.  The green tomato taste was strange to us.

Easy to make, but not much flavor in the breading.  It was also a really really thin breading.  I'm going to attempt this again, but maybe alter the ingredients a bit.

Sorry, just couldn't live up to my expectations AND I tried it twice. Maybe good enough for a novice, but a down home girl wont be impressed.
