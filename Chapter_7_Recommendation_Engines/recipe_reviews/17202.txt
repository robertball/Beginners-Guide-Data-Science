The great thing about this recipe is that it gives you the taste of world cuisine with household ingredients and very easy preparation.  My husband and I both enjoyed this meal and we will make it again.  The only changes I made were using milk instead of half and half, black pepper instead of white (that's what I had on hand) and adding salt to taste since the recipe did not call for any.  I served over rice with some sauteed eggplant.

Make sure your children like spicy dishes because
this one I thought was a bit on the spicy side.

I wish I could make believe I had eaten this.  

I made this last night and my five year old took one bite and said it was disgusting.  He ended up eating a bowl of cereal for dinner.  

My very easy to please husband took his first bite and said it tastes like chicken and tomatoes.  AND I almost doubled the cumin.  (When I asked my husband what he would like for dinner tonight, he said "anything as long as it is not what you made last night.")

I will not make this again.

Very good with basmati rice.  Vegetarian version is use mock chicken recipe using frozen tofu.  Can't say how kids like this since all the pups have left the wolf den many moons ago.  This was a howling success with my mate.  I also used a little more cumin than recipe called for.

I made this recipe for Valentine's, and it turned out to be a man-pleaser. Since my honey and I both have reflux and can't eat tomatoes, I substituted the stewed tomatoes with frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower). I also didn't have allspice, so I used pumpkin pie spice instead, and it worked GREAT! This is definitely something I'd make again.

Something didn't work with this--my cream curdled in the tomatoes.  The flavors were okay, but not a recipe I'd make again, I'm afraid.

This was the perfect recipe to use up some dairy we had in the fridge. It came together quickly and the flavors were a nice change for us, as our standard flavors are Italian or Mexican. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I only added 1/2 the cumin, because it is a little spicy. I also saute green pepper slices in the oil with the chicken. It adds a really good flavor!

After reading all the reviews, decided this sounded good. Following the advice of previous reviews doubled the cumin, nutmeg and allspice. All were fresh.  Result,very bland. Even added garlic and mint. The ingredients are good. Can someone tell me what I did wrong?

Sorry, but this recipes deserves an acquired taste and we just couldn't do it.  Found the flavors did not compliment each other well.  Even with more cumin it was not flavorful enough

Delicious and easy to make.
We garnished it with chopped peanuts.
Basmati rice would compliment it nicely.

Followed the recipe as instructed. I didn't find the flavors overwhelming, but then again I didn't find it to be too flavorful either. There's something missing. I served this both with naan and couscous.

I thought the recipe was pretty good.  The half and half curdled as expected but a bit of corn starch took care of that.  I added two chopped Thai chillies (the little red ones) for a bit of heat and a about a tablespoon of greek oregano for a bit of freshness.

I served this over bulger instead of couscous or white rice - it was great.  It also makes a nice leftover.

I didn't have cream so I just doubled the sour cream (used fat free), mixed the spices in the sour cream and added a can of tomatoes, didn't have stewed tomatoes. I also added some toasted almonds.  I liked it! Very different but really easy.  I will make it again.  Make sure you salt and pepper your chicken.

My family loves this recipe.  I add 1/4 cup golden raisons to add a little sweetness and serve it over toasted pine nut couscous.  It's fabulous and super easy.
