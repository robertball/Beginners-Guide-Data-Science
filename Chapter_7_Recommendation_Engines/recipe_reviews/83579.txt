I made this stew for a family dinner.  My son's girlfriends are both vegetarian and I was having beef stew so I made this so they could eat stew also.  We served the stews in bread bowls.  It was a great hit with the girlfriends and with those of ua who weren't vegetarians!  I made it as the directions said and i
t was just right.  Thank you for the recipe that made me a hit with my sons and their girlfriends!

Obviously, I think this is delicious.  I used olive oil rather than butter.  Not knowing what "bunches" of leeks meant, I used two leeks.  Chinese cabbage is called "Napa" cabbage at my grocery.  I used red potatoes; 1/4 teaspoon cayenne and omitted the bay leaves.  Using a good organic vegetable broth (Pacific or Wolf Gang)will make this more stew-like than soup.

This recipe made so much! I used northern beans instead of black beans, because of what is available in Scandinavia. Otherwise, I followed this recipe closely. I added also some leftover zucchini and bell pepper. The taste got better as time went along. Since my boyfriend did not really like it, I had to eat it all- it took me almost a week.

This stew was absolutely delicious! I'm a vegetarian always looking for new recipes to cook up & this one will be added to my favorites. No changes except cooking it a bit longer to soften veggies a bit more. Great!

My family loves this stew!!!!  My two young boys even love it!  This is a family staple now.  The only changes I have made were to use different cabbages, depending upon organic availability, and to cook this longer (and only because I don't fuss or keep close watch on time!).  It always turns out wonderfully and any of my friends who have tried this have loved it as well.  Even my mother-in-law, who likes almost nothing she doesn't cook, asked me for the recipe!!

I cooked this on high in the crock pot for 6 hours.  Definitely made it a stew this way.  Had to add more liquid it was so thick.  Taste was good as written.  Didn't have any cabbage and used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce.

Really yummy. I substituted extra cabbage and spinach for the potatoes. I also made my first batch with pinto beans, instead of black beans, which was very tasty. Since I didn't have vegetable stock, I used beef broth, which brought out the flavor in the veggies. I dolloped a bit of French Onion light dip on top with cheese and fresh basil. YUM. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was delicious.  It turned out more like soup than a stew, but that's okay.  The seasoning was perfect.  I simmered it for 30 minutes (a bit longer than the recipe suggested).  I didn't have leeks or elephant garlic, so I skipped those and just used 2 (minced) cloves of regular garlic.  My husband had been complaining about me never serving meat, so I skipped the cheese and simply sauteed 8 oz. of sliced knockwurst (my old stand-by) with the onions and garlic at the beginning of the recipe.  Oh, and I used olive oil instead of butter - keeping it kosher. :)  My husband and daughter loved it.  It's very hearty - a great recipe for those crisp autumn days.

The flavor is excellent.  I added flour to thicken it up a bit, a dash of cumin and used organic chicken broth instead of vegetable, since it was what I had handy.  I think that next time I make it I will decrease by a potato, add a carrot, can of kidney beans and a can of corn.

I made this as per the recipe except cooked it a little longer and made bisquick dumplings on top.    Even if you are not a vegetarian, this is an excellent, hearty  dinner on a cold winter night!  Deeeelicious!

This wonderful stew might make a vegetarian out of me yet.  It was absolutely delicious and even though it makes quite a lot, I've had it twice for dinner and numerous lunches.  Loved, loved, loved it.  Will be making it many more times.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This was delicious!  I made it exactly as described, then embellished with some previously cooked pork loin braised in milk.   It didn't need it, mind you, I just had it on hand.  It's like the comfortyest comfort food ever.   I will make this stew forevermore.

This was an awesome stew. I went out of the box & used parsnips instead of potatoes,and used seasoning that I had in the house. Very hearty dish.  Will definitely  make again.

Based on the other reviews I read, I expected this dish to be a lot better. I thought the tomato sauce was overpowering, and it could probably be left out. I also added flour, as others suggested because it was very soupy. It wasn't terrible, my boyfriend enjoyed it, and without the tomato sauce it probably would've been a lot better.

Wow -- this was really good!  I followed some other reviews and used oil instead of butter and zuchinni, but no celery or celery salt.  I also used 1 bag of shredded cabbage (coleslaw mix) and 6 cups of veggie broth.  Very yummy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this on a whim.  I didn't have any of the main ingredients and it still came out WONDERFUL!  Instead of Leeks & Chinese cabbage, I used a frozen block of chopped spinach & used more of the other ingredients. Instead of vegetable broth I used a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix.  I added lots more potatoes.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!  Thank you Wakula!

i really love this stew! it is more like a soup as others have written, but that can be tweaked with a litle bit of flour.
what i love so much about this is that you can do a variety of things with this and come up with many different flavors and recipes. or, make as stated and it's so delicious!
i had just received my farm share and had no idea what i was going to do with it all and then i came across this recipe. it's perfect!

Love this! I'm not a huge fan of the texture of most traditional vegetable soups, so I cooked it as instructed but held off adding the cabbage, beans + bay leaves. I cooled it, then used my blender to process a little more than 1/2 the recipe (making sure to put all of the potatoes in the blender to make it the consistency thicker) and added it back along with the remaining ingredients and cooked for another 10 minutes - it was delicious! I should mention that I also didn't have oregano and celery salt, so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning (which btw does not have meat in it) instead. Definitely a staple in my recipe book.

This dish is amazingly wonderful. I didn't purchase the $5.99 elephant garlic and used regular - also added mushrooms (at the end) and cauliflower. It's a nice mixture of flavor, spice, and vegetable.

I had quite a  bit of Chinese cabbage I needed to use up and came accross this recipe.  My husband and I both loved it.  I simmered for and extra hour and thickened with flour so it had a more stew-like consistency.  I will be making this again!

This was quite good. As others have said, it makes a lot, so prepared to freeze some unless you are feeding an army.  Will make again.  Note: I used spinach instead of cabbage because tha's what I had, but I definitely think the cabbage would have been better as it would have added a differnet texture.  We also doubled all the spices except the bay, which was a good choice for us.  I also added two cans of canary beans to up the protein.  All in all, a good stew to celebrate the autumnal equinox.

This is pretty good for a veggie stew. It did turn out very soupy so next time I will use less vegetable broth. I am a Vegan so I used olive oil instead of butter and left out the cheese.  With all the washing, peeling and chopping prep time was more like 30 minutes and not the 15 stated but it was still a quick and easy stew to make and tasted good too.

I loved this recipe! It was so easy and delicious. The only thing I didn't do was add the cayenne pepper (i didn't have any). But it was still sooo yummy. The perfect thing for a cold rainy fall evening. This will definitely become one of my regulars.

This was like a really hearty minestrone. I omitted the cabbage and celery but threw in a zucchini. A wonderful warming soup for a cold day!

This is really good. I do leave out the celery salt, cayenne and bay leaves though. I've tried it with bok choy and with swiss chard at different times and they are both good. I do tend to use pinto or white kidney beans instead of the black beans because that's what my kids like. Yes, my kids eat this. They don't love it, but they don't complain or refuse to eat it, which is good.

Very tasty.  I didn't have any celery salt and substituted mixed Italian dried herbs for the oregano, but other than that I didn't change a thing.  Very warming, filling, and healthy.

I’ve been making this for years now.  It’s substitution-friendly!  The base flavours are spot on!

This is my go to soup.  The only thing I change is that I add garbanzo beans for protein.

I cut the recipe in half and it still made a lot. Hubby and I had enough for 3 meals! It was delicious and very easy to adjust to what you have or don't have on hand. Thanks!

My vegetarian child and meat-eating family members both liked this stew.  I chose to add a tablespoon of flour dissolved in 2 tablespoons of water to thicken.  I also let my stew cook 20 minutes longer to allow the veggies to soften more.  This recipe makes a lot of stew!

We loved this stew! Excellent flavor!   I added some rice leftover from another dish and used only of the potatoes.  I also used only 1/2 the amount of cabbage.  We will definitely have this as one of our staple soups!

This was great. The cheese was a nice touch to round out a hearty vegetarian meal. I added some turnips to the mix instead of potatoes and it worked great.

Totally delicious.  I did substitute cauliflower for the celery & leeks though and probably gave it a large dose of cheyenne instead of a dash -

I wonder how this would be with seafood?
