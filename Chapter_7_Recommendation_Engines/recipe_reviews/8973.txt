I have to admit that the flavouring was rather bland with skinless boneless chicken breasts.

My husband loved this, and he really dislikes baked pineapples AND baked chicken.  I added some seasoning (garlic, red pepper, and paprika), used thighs and added sweet and sour 5 minutes before cooking time was over.  Definately repeatable.

Very tasty. Just poured the sweet & sour sauce on chicken before adding the pineapple and rum. Added about 25 min. cooking time. Will be cooking this regularly.

The recipie seems incomplete (it doesn't mention the sweet and sour sauce), and just guessing what to do with it and when to add it to the mix didn't work out to well.  This tasted pretty bland.  I don't plan on cooking anything with Al's name on it again.

I found this receipe to be a lot of wasted time!!! I found this receipe to be a waste of GOOD RUM!!!  You can't even taste the RUM, I wanted to tell you that if you are going to make this dish you have to adjust the RUM in this dish!! The whole thing is that you can omit the RUM by putting in Rum flavoring, while you put in the flavoring don't put in too much!!!

thought this was quite good.  I used boneless breasts, cruzan rum, and fresh pineapple.  LUX, calm down hon.  :)  Could use a bit more spice, I added some hot sauce after...

Very bland.  Even with marinating for several hours. 

Would not cook this again.

The chicken had a great taste. As a variation I added crushed garlic and red pepper flakes. This really added to the taste.

Had to cook this about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  The ingredients list sweet and sour sauce, but nowhere in the body of the recipe  is the sauce mentioned. Not a keeper recipe.

Found the Chicken to be under cooked at given times, still pink.
After cooking until done the flavor was bland. All-in-all a waste of good Rum.
I won't be making this one again.

Very tasty! Left off the rum and used chicken legs instead.Took quite a bit longer to cook for some reason. Ended it with broiling for a couple of minutes after spooning sauce on top so that chicken crisped a little. My husband really enjoyed the sauce. Will be adding it to my rotation instead of plain old barbeque chicken all the time.

I was very disappointed by the lack of flavor in this dish. Perhaps this would be better in a slow cooker

This recipe needs more instructions and omits some ingredients in the steps.  I rated it this way only because I made alterations and the basic idea for recipe was used.  I made it with chicken thighs and marinated them in coconut rum for an hour and a half.  When cooking them, I added pineapple chunks and followed the temperature for first part that was covered, after uncovering I added 10 minutes to the time it already calls for.  The sweet and sour sauce I used as a little dip for the meat.  Seeing that it calls out one full can I'm assuming it is meant to be incorporated into beginning marinade or as a basting glaze as it cooks.  I will be making this again and will try the sweet and sour as a basting glaze next time.  I will for sure use coconut rum again since the taste was very prevalent.  Plain rum wouldn't have enough flavor to it if the sweet and sour is being used as a marinade or glaze. I would recommend a flavored rum like pineapple or coconut.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and spiced rum. The flavor of the sauce was very tasty and the chicken was tender and juicy. Will make again!

I tried this recipe tonight, just slightly added a few things and traded pineapples for mandarin oranges instead. I used 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs, marinated them in mango cruzen rum overnight. Then put the chicken and half the rum marinate in a pan with 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper, alittle salt and half the 11oz can of juice from the mandarin oranges covered it and cooked it at 400 degrees for 30 mins, then took the pan out uncovered it and added the other half of rum marinate, plus the rest of juices from mandarin oranges, plus the orane pieces into the pan. I then put it back into the oven uncovered for another 30 mins, and waaalaa..... it looked and smelled and tasted delicious! My sons and i really enjoyed this meal, it's deffinetly a keeper, maybe next time we'll try it with the pineapples!!!
