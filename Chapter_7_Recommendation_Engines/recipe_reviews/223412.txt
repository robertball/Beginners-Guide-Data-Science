Delicious! Only thing I added was 1 tbsp of whole grain Dijon mustard and I used a fresh cabbage/carrot mixture instead of prepared. This will be my go-to slaw recipe!

The slaw came out very, very good.  I had a bag of ranch flavored sunflower seeds and needed to use some up.  The added crunch makes this recipe.  Thank you!

Flavorful and easy! I left out the celery, but added bacon bits.

This is a delicious slaw.  I did change two things.  Since I don't care for celery, I omitted it and I decreased the amount of mayo.  Next time I might add some hearts of palm in place of the celery.  The sunflower seeds were really great.  The crunch adds a surprise that is delightful to the palette.

I liked this coleslaw!  It was the closest to the original I could find, but I did put tiny slices of carrots in instead of celery. I also skipped the green onion, and I would probably decrease further still the White Onion.  My husband said it tastes like White Spot's coleslaw, which means that this was a hit! I loved the sunflower seeds! I will definitely make it again.

Not much flavor. Not doing again.
