My husband has talked about this drink for years since he grew up in St. Croix. I finally tried this and I was surprised how great it is. You could taste all the flavors separately but they blended nicely too. I used Cruzan Estate Diamond Rum and lime from the squeezy bottle. It sounded like a lot of lime juice, but was just right after all. I definitely recommend this! Thanks for the taste of the islands.

New favorite drink. No, really. This was awesome! I made mine a little......different with Coke Zero and Captain Morgan spiced rum. Even my husband liked this. The fresh lime juice is key. Don't chinze out and use bottled--it won't be as good, trust me.

It's just a rum and coke with lime. Can't really go wrong with that.

Pretty good, simple drink. I made this with coke but I'm more of a pepsi fan...will be trying that next time. I also like the extra lime kick in there.

Is this just a rum and coke? Yes and there's no problem with that, it's still a recipe and deserves to be here. I really support the submitter's inclusion of substantial lime juice. It just isn't the same when you order a double and get some skinny lime wisp floating on the top: it's always going to be a great drink but I feel the lime juice sets off the light sweetness of the rum. This is my absolute FAVORITE coctail with Bacardi white rum and diet Coke, made that way it's one of the lowest calorie coctails and most every place can make it for you. Cheers, thanks very much for submitting :)

I was introduced to the Cuba Libre many moons ago. My favorite drink. For a true Cuba Libre it must be Bacardi dark rum, Cola and a lime wedge. I prefer coke.

I was first introduced to this drink while on a cruise of the Mexican Riviera.  They did it a little differently and it was so yummy! They used Rum, Pepsi, lime juice and..... a dash of margarita salt! Just thrown right in the glass! Definitely not to sweet.  I am looking forward to making it myself!

I find this method to be too sweet. A better variation is to use half cola and half club soda. Rub the lime in the run of the glass and go easy on lime juice in the drink. Use plenty of ice.
