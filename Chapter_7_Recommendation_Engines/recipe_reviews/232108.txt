Love this basic recipe. We make a peanut butter popcorn using this. The changes I made were; have all dry ingredients mixed together first, (I added sesame seeds & Craisins), then mix the brown sugar & cinnamon with the honey/peanut butter mix & microwave 30 seconds then add vanilla. Combine the two then bake. Yummy!

This puts boxed chocolate granola to shame. It was especially tasty warm out of the oven. I followed the recipe, although some ingredients weren't super specific. It didn't say if the sunflower seeds were roasted or raw. I had both, and did a majority raw and some of the roasted unsalted I had just bought. It also didn't say if the coconut was sweetened, or not, so I just chose sweetened shredded coconut. For the chocolate I used Nestle dark chocolate chips. In the description it mentions if the chocolate melts add in afterwards. Mine did not melt. However, I keep my chocolate chips in the freezer. So, they went into the batch very cold. I suggest doing that, if that could be an issue. Also, I probably added a smidgen more of the chocolate, than what was called for, due to just wanting to finish what I had in the bag. Either way, I will not lie this is sweet with 4 sugar based ingredients. There was some clumping of the oatmeal, due to the brown sugar and honey, but the sunflower seeds and chocolate mainly stay separate. Though, the small clusters were not super hard like the store bought boxed stuff which I really liked. Note, this granola will almost fill a large sheet pan once everything is added, despite only being 2 cups of oatmeal. This is also quite high in calories, per serving. Although, the store bought seems to be the same. It was interesting to try for a different flavor. I usually stick to maple or vanilla ones.

I make this regularly for my son to take back to college. He shares with friends who all love it. I do find that I need to double or even triple the peanut butter/honey combo if I want big clumps. We prefer a granola that clumps rather than just loose. I have better luck making it clumpy if I make this "flat" on a cookie sheet. I press down firmly and bake about 25 minutes or until nice and brown. I do not stir during cooking and I let cool on the cookie sheet for a few hours before I break up into clumps. I wouldn't exactly call this healthy! Very sweet and loaded with fat but I get rave reviews when I make it!!

Was very simple to prepare and is delicious!  Just enough chocolate to satisfy a sweet tooth.  I add 1/4 cup to my yogurt.

Crunchy and delicious! If you want bigger clumps, use more peanut butter and honey. I made it without chocolate to use it on top of my smoothie bowls.

Wow! I can't stop eating this granola. So easy and so delicious. In the future, I plan to cut down the chocolate chips and sugar to make it healthier so that I don't feel as bad abut eating it all of the time.

I made this for my annual girls ocean get away week end, and, everybody raved about it.  I served it with Greek honey yogurt, and, fresh raspberries.  One woman said it was the bomb.  I will be adding this recipe to my breakfast rotation.
