They made a similar sandwich like this one at the deli where I used to work.  However, it was made with the addition of homemade blue cheese mayo and smoked turkey.  It was one of our most popular specials and so delicious!

The flavor was good but I found the texture to be very dry. Maybe it would be better with some sort of spread.

This is decent in taste, but nothing special like I was expecting.  If you hate blue cheese, this won't have enough "yum" to overcome that.  It's almost bland, to be honest.  Would be better with a spread or sauce or something to tie the flavors together.  I'm a major fan of all these flavors, but having them together didn't make magic like I'd hoped.

These sandwiches are pretty tasty, but I replaced the pear with Fuji apple slices and melted the blue cheese to give it some crisp as well as something to take away the dryness.

Loved this!!!!!!!!!!  I also made a batch with Cambert and it was milder but awsome.  I think any cheese you like would be great.

Okay so I didn't exactly do this recipe as written.  I basicacly used the idea of it.  I used small sour dough sliced cocktail bread, broiled each slice then  flipped it over spread poppy seed dressing on one side. I then added the pear and bacon.  I used feta cheese and mozzarella cheese instead of the blue cheese.  I then broiled them for just a minute or two.  Then and drizzled more poppy seed dressing on top. I made this for a party and could not keep enough of them going.  Every one loved them.  It took a while for people to figure out the flavors.  The pears are very subtle. The poppy seed dressing added a sweet topping.  It was labor intense though.  But sooo worth it.

Recipe Group Selection:  29, September 2012 ~ This was an interesting little sandwich.  We liked the ingredients, just not crazy about them served together.  I made mine with the called for blue cheese and made my husband's with feta cheese.  We felt there needed to be something spread on the bread before adding the toppings, maybe a THIN layer of mayonnaise or possibly broiling the bread with olive oil before adding everything else.  We ate them and took some to the neighbors to try.  I'm glad we tried this as we do enjoy new recipe.

Recipe Group selection of 9/29/12.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have apple juice, so I improvised and I think it worked quite well.  I cooked my bacon and sliced my pear as it cooked.  I removed the bacon and sauteed the pear slices in the drippings.  I assembled my sandwiches on homemade French Bread, but it seemed as if it might need more moisture, so I spread each toasted slice with about a tsp of bleu cheese dressing, then added the pear slices then the bacon and finally the crumbled bleu cheese.  The only complaint brought to my attention was I should have made twice as much.  Thanks, Harleaghsgirl, this is a keeped!

Made this for Recipe Group...YUM! I cheated and used canned pears b/c I already had those on hand, and i figured that once the pears cooked in the apple juice, it would pretty much be the same thing. I also used some homemade Italian bread that I lightly toasted on both sides before topping w/ the pears, bacon and blue cheese. This had a wonderful flavor, and I loved the sweet/savory/tangy combination! This would be a great appetizer on toasted baguette slices, or just alongside a nice salad for light lunch or dinner. I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made for Recipe Group.  This was an interesting combination of flavors.  I loved the sweet & salty thing.  I did not have focaccia bread, and so used one slice of pumpernickel, and one slice of wheat.  Otherwise I stuck close to the recipe.  This was my lunch today, but I'm hungry again, so not too filling.  Mr C & the kids are too picky to try these, but they will be good to bring to a luncheon.
