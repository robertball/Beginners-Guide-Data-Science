For the person who didn't quite care for the dressing and was preferring something creamier--
Stir a small spoonful of mayo or cream into the dressing.  That will give it a creamier consistency.

A pinch of dijon mustard would help too.  (It was the missing flavor component in my taste.)

You can also wisk the dressing to emulsify it.

This recipe was excellent!  I doubled the dressing so that I would have some left for tomorrow night's salad. I always include a salad with our dinner and this was a great change from the same old same old.

The dressing really is as good as the reviews say--and it's so simple! I added black and kalamata olives and pine nuts, and that put this salad over the edge. This is a new favorite!

This recipe was delicious! I followed it exactly being the first time i have ever tried to make dressing myself. It was great, i used it as a side salad. But next time i think i'll make extra and marinade some chicken in it and make a salad as the main dish! Great recipe!

So good and healthy and salty goodness...Although the anchovies in a blender or food processor don't really work (maybe I just don't have hi-tech kitchen gadgets). I recommend just chopping them up very finely and whisking all the ingredients together in a bowl, works better.

I LOVED this dressing!!!  But I love any dressing with anchovy.  I thought it was light and fresh and really different.  Will make again and again since it's so easy too!!

This dressing reminds me of the days when they used to make Caesar salad dressing in a wooden bowl and mashed the garlic to coat the bowl, etc.  The taste is so similar without the eggs and hard work to boot.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Good and simple, and definitely reminiscent of a Caesar salad.  Open to lots of different variations if you want.  Thank you for posting this!

This is a great little salad. I serve it with creamy pasta dishes. It's a wonderful lighter alternative to  Caesar salad.

Very simple, yet delicious dressing.  I use the dressing on all sorts of salads - I like anchovies.  Even if you do not like anchovies, you may like this because they are blended into the dressing.  The acidity of the lemon juice balances the anchovies' saltiness.  I do not always use the Parmesan cheese - in combination with the anchovies, it adds additional salt.  You might try cutting back on both the anchovies and the cheese if you wish to include both.

Wow. The dressing is amazing!! This recipe is easily worthy of 5 stars, but it's even better if you throw in some halved grape tomatoes, some peeled English cucumber, and grate some Parmesan over it all. Thanks so much, Hong!

So I throughly enjoyed this recipe. I love anchovies (especially in salad dressing). The fresh shaved parmesan cheese comleted this dish. Will be making repeatedly.

I just made this and it's very good.  It's quick and easy and tastes like light caesar salad.  I added more garlic and lemon juice to the dressing.  It really improved the taste.  Thank you for the recipe.

AMAZING dressing! I prefer my dressing a little chunkier so I finely chopped my anchovies and didn't blend them. I also used 4 garlic cloves instead of the one. I love garlic!!

i make this all the time now rather then my normal Caesar dressing with mayo (no eggs since i am pregnant) - it also cuts down significant calories!  Shaved parm on top does the trick!  Light fresh and delicious!  !

Okay.  It's missing something, but I can't put my finger on it.  Maybe I just prefer creamier caesar dressings.

This dressing is fantastic!  Confession...used anchovy paste; had on hand rather than the actual “anchovies” and was pleased to determine that after blending with the other ingredients, this shortcut proved to be acceptable in a pinch! I love this salad because it fits the bill as an appetizer and/or salad and can be made in a short time before hand. Delicious and simple, yet fairly elegant in its presentation. Pairs well with poultry, pork and beef, as well as an excellent start to a seafood entree (especially pan seared large scallops!). Can’t go wrong!

This is easy to modify. I used Vietnamese fish sauce (anchovies fermented with salt) instead of whole anchovies and vegan mayonnaise in place of oil, plus I added a dash of kalamata olive juice. That made it a little sharper & creamier. YUM.

This is actually classic Caesar without the coddled egg or homemade croutons.  I make this salad by rubbing crushed garlic over the bottom and sides of the bowl.  Be sure to mince the garlic over the bowl in order to catch the squirts of juice from the cloves.  I then toss the romaine (hearts are best).  It's easier and a pretty presentation if all the romaine leaves are are laid whole, in one direction.  Then, alternate fresh squeezed lemon juice,  and a good quality olive oil, tossing after each addition.  I do this to taste.  If one were to add coddled egg, one would add it at this point - this is how one gets the more creamy consistency.  Add a dash of Worcestershire and toss.  Then, add finely chopped anchovies and finally, the fresh shaved parmigiano-reggiano cheese.  I also usually make homemade croutons and give people a choice to include them or not.  Make this salad as you are going to serve it - it makes for a fun table side presentation. Be sure to bring a pepper mill to the table as well.

Very good simple dressing that is reminiscent of Caesar's dressing.

This was good and different than our other caesar salads we make.  It seemed like an old fashion version.  We thought it was good but we prefer a creamier dressing.
