I've made this recipe at least 6 times since I found it on-line.  I used Venison the first time but now use ground combo Beef/Pork . Wonderful.

I've never liked the taste of vinsion and usually refuse to eat it, but this recipe was to die for! I made a few minor changes: instead of using tomato suace, i used a jar of Ragu traditional spaghetti sauce. I didn't have basil on hand, so i used 1/4 tsp. of oregano instead. I also used 1/4 lb of ground beef mixed in with the venison meat to cut the gamey taste. It was awesome! It went so fast too. Serve with garlic bread and it's a meal fit for a king!

It was OK.  Next time, if I make it again, I'll just mix up the noodles and meat mixture and top it with the cheeses.  I don't understand the layering and it just didn't work for me.  The flavor is OK.  Tastes kind of Italian, which I'm not crazy about.

Quick, easy and inexpensive dish with great flavor!  Next time I would use less noodles and more sauce.  I ended up putting some spaghetti sauce in it to make it a little saucier to suit our tastes and it was great.  My husband wants me to make this for deer camp this year!

We have a freezer full of venison, so I am always looking for new ideas. I used 12 ounces of wheat penne and 1 1/2 cans of tomato sauce.  Even though I used less pasta/more sauce it was still a little dry.

I made this after my dad got a deer. I couldn't detect a gamey taste, and I didn't change anything. I think next time I'll mix it all together instead of layers. Thanks for sharing!

Try changing the spice pallette on this dish. Used cumin and turmeric, also substituted whole wheat rotini, mixed mozzarella, cheddar and swiss cheeses, and added one 15oz can of pinto beans. Instant hit in our house.

i did this exactly according to recipe except i used gluten free pasta. and it seemed to be way lacking in sauce. so I'm wondering, does the gluten free make a difference? maybe only one 8 oz pkg would have been better...
