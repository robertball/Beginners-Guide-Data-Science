Delicious! And, while this bread is great all by itself, the addition of butter, garlic, herbs, and Parmesan cheese really take these over the top. Plus it's very easy and you have garlic bread in no time at all. Perfect accompaniment to any meal!

This was a big hit! Instead of using a fresh garlic, I used 1 tablespoon of store bought minced garlic (in water)  #yummy

This is amazing! Hands-down the best garlic bread I’ve ever had. The parsley freshens it up and gives it a beautifully rounded flavor. I doubled the amount of garlic cloves because we are a garlic-loving family. There wasn’t a single piece of bread left over after dinner!

Since there was none left, my guess is the family loved it. Great recipe!
