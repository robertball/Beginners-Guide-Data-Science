EXCELLENT!  Moist, delicious and quick to make!  I baked my cake in a 9 x 13 pan and it turned out beautifully.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.

This is a wonderful cake! I followed the suggestions made by another reviewer. I substituted an extra 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup oil.  I also used a bundt pan.  I had to cook for 50 minutes, and it probably could have baked a little longer, but it was fine.  It didn't come out of the pan clean, that is my only complaint, otherwise it was DELICIOUS! I didn't use anything to top it, but it would be great with a cream cheese frosting. I will do that next time. My husband took some back to work with him to share with his work buddies.  He absolutely raved about it! It was so easy, I will make this again and again!

This cake was delicious, moist and very easy, I've made it twice and everyone has loved it.  I made this cake in a bundt pan.  I did make a couple of substitutions...  I replaced 1/2 cup of oil with an additional 1/2 cup of applesauce (I always do that to reduce fat), I also added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves for extra spice.  I only needed to cook it for 40 minutes.

I made this exactly to the instructions, used a bundt pan, baked for 50 minutes, and it turned out great. I like that it is not overly sweet.  I eat too many sweets as it is.

Fabulous!!!  Thanks for the suggestions of substituting 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 oil.  I ran out of plain applesauce and used apple/strawberry sauce instead; added just a bit of nutmeg - my boys (19 & 13) absolutely love it.  Can't keep them away from it!!! (lol)   Thanks!!! :)

I am always on the lookout for inexpensive ways to treat my kids without the junk. Fall is a perfect time to crank up the heat and use up those apples. I had some old (we only eat crunchy) apples laying around and I peeled them, cored them and threw them in the crock pot with some spices and OJ for a couple of hours, mashed with potato masher and had applesauce galore. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I always try to cut down on the sugar and the oil. I used half the sugar (raw) and half the oil (coconut), as well as replaced one cup of white flour with whole wheat I found in the freezer. It turned out sweet enough. I made a double batch and 5 kids devoured it. The texture was airy and cake like, moist and absolutely a keeper on anyone's healthy dessert or breakfast menu. Easy to assemble the day before (at least dry ingr) and very forgiving.  Enjoy it!

Cake for BREAKFAST!  My 4 year old LOVES THAT!   (Me too!)
I added the extra 1/2 cup applesauce and only used 3/4 cup oil-I found it too moist using 1 cup.  I also added 1/4 t. each ground nutmeg and ginger.  I have also used 3 t. Chinese 5-spice (w/OUT pepper! read the labels) and it was great!

I read the reviews and all the suggestions and I did the 2.5 cups of applesauce, 1 cup of oil, 3t cinnamon, 2t nutmeg and 1.5t cloves.  The spices made it more of an applesauce spice cake which is what we prefer.  Very moist and in no need of frosting unless you have a super sweet tooth.

Excellent. So moist and dense, a small slice was quite filling. My kids loved it as well and it was an easy recipe for them to help prepare.I also substituted extra applesauce for some of the oil and I baked in bundt pan. Took about 60m. I used cream cheese II frosting. Will definitely make again!

Worked great as recommended...decrease vegetable oil to 3/4 cups and increase applesauce to 2+1/2 cups.  I used it for my daughter's first birthday cake - with cream cheese frosting II and marshmallow fondant.

Great recipe!  I substituted 1/2 cup oil for 1/2 cup applesauce and used self raising flour. The cake turned out perfect except for being a little more moist than I would've liked.  So, for the next time, I would omit the extra applesauce and cook it for a little bit longer.  The cake has a muffin sort of texture and would even be great baked as individual muffins.  I highly recommend this recipe to those who love the apple/cinnamon flavour!

I added 1/2 tsp of cloves and added chopped pecans for texture.  Turned out fine, the only thing i noticed was, you can taste the baking soda.  It's moist and fluffy, I'll make it again.

I do not always have applesauce on hand, in fact I had canned pears last fall and I threw them in the food processor to make sauce. Same effect.  It is all in the spices.  I like spicey cake so I had ginger and cloves along with the cinnamon.  If you have a can of peaches you could probably do the same thing!

Made this severa times and family loves it. This morning I had 7 or 8 fresh pears that i needed to use. I peeled them, made them into a sauce, used them instead of applesauce. Either way, the cake is wonderful and a family favorite!

Great recipe!  I made it in 2 loaf pans, used unsweetened applesauce and added 4 T brown sugar and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Also followed others and substituted 1/2 c oil with 1/2 c applesauce. Will definitely make this again.

4.5 stars!  Easy to make, especially considering the simple ingredients (which I had on hand).  Tasted great in muffin/cupcake form - very fluffy and light and yummy - and my boyfriend decided to throw the batter into the waffle maker to see what happened.  The results were great!  Same light sweetness but with a slightly more crisp outside (definitely not crunchy, just a bit firmer).

I came looking for this recipe today as I had 2 cups of  homemade Gravenstein applesauce in my fridge that I wanted to do something with. We had our first slices while the cake was still a bit warm. We found it very flavorful, moist, and delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again and again. The thick, homemade applesauce probably added something extra for the flavor. I used 1 teaspoon salt,  used 2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon baking soda. I used only 1 cup oil instead of 1 1/2 cups but did not increase the applesauce. I used the cinnamon as called for and liked the balance with the apple flavor. Thank you so much for a luscious and really easy cake recipe. I used a bundt  pan and baked it for 55 minutes. A glaze would have been lovely but we enjoyed it plain.

Very good cake.  I did do the substitution like others did of putting in more applesauce.  As is, it did seem like a lot of oil.  This cake is also a great way to get rid of applesauce.  For moistness it gets a perfect score.  It's probably one of the moistest cakes I've ever made.  I love the cinnamon in there too but good as it is, I think it needs a little something extra.  More apple flavor maybe, a crumb topping or frosting of some sort.  It's not super sweet so it can handle it.  Last thing, my oven is older and it is scorching hot, so the cake was done in only 30 minutes.  Keep an eye on it just in case ;).

Great cake. Made it as a Bundt cake. Cooked for 50-55 min. I used homemade chunky applesauce. I replaced applesauce for 1/2 c of the oil. I only used 3/4 c of oil. The bottom of the bundt had a crunchy/chewy crust because I overcooked it a few minutes but it tasted really good. I put Cream Cheese frosting on it.

This is wonderful!  I had a jar of applesauce that needed used up, so I thought I would try out this recipe.  I took other users' suggestions and substituted 1/2 cup of the vegetable oil for an extra 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves to jazz it up a bit.  Next time I'm going to try it out with dried cranberries!  To top off this wonderful cake, I whipped up a batch of the Caramel Frosting IV (found here) and my hubby and I thought we were tasting a bit of Heaven. Thank you so much!

I'm a novice cook at best, but trying to reach deep within to find some of that domesticity that I know must be in there somewhere.  [I should disclose that my adult-living teacher in high school offered me an A, if I didn't come back to class.  That's how bad it was.  lol]   I appreciate simple, easy-to-follow recipes, that turn out really well and scores me some accolades!  This was one of those recipes.  I made it for my Sunday School class to go with our morning coffee & everyone really raved about it!  Gives me hope to keep working at it!

Moist and wonderful.
I also substituted the oil. And I halved the recipe for a smaller cake. It works! Such an easy recipe to do!! And not as sweet as some other cakes. I added raisins.

I halved the entire recipe and baked in a loaf pan. I also cut the sugar by half and used unsweetened applesauce. I subbed more applesauce for half of the oil and it is plenty sweet and moist. I also added some ginger and cloves. Spices should be added to taste.

This cake was delicious and very moist. I think the next time I make it I will add the extra applesauce and make a cream cheese frosting.

100% whole wheat flour, and this cake was still light and delicious.  I decreased the sugar by a little and I added the nuts and a small amount of icing on top.

This cake is awesome!  I used walnut oil and whole wheat pastry flour. I also added ginger and cloves. I used 2 1/2 cups organic applesauce and 3/4 cups Oil (walnut).  Very good! It taste like Fall!!!!

The cake came out very moist and light, with great aroma. Absolutely delicious with coffee or alone as a snack. 
The cake is not very sweet (I used unsweetened applesauce), maybe next time I will add a bit more sugar and/or try sweetened applesauce. 
I subsituted 1/2 oil for applesauce, like the other reviewers. 
The batter was enough for a bundt cake mold and a small bread loaf mold. Baked both together for 50 minutes and came out just right. Will make again!

I halfed the recipe since it seemed alot for making a first time.  I pretty much followed the recipe except for two slight changes. Like most everyone, I didn't use all the oil it asked for. I just added a little more applesauce.  I also used a homestyle applesauce that had chunks of apples in it.  It came out incredibly moist!  My little ones loved it, even with out the confectioner sugar sprinkled on top.  Not too sweet.  I put it in an 8x8 pan. Next time I'll just make as muffins.  Will definitely be making again.

I have a bunch of honecanned pears and pearsauce so when I found this recipe I decided to interchange the fruit. It came out wonderful! I have made this several times now. Once with only a cup of sugar (I was out) and it was more breadlike, but yummy with butter. And I like to add my special pumpkin pie spice to it. I did cut out 1/4 cup of the oil like many people suggested.  This recipe has been a big hit.  I love how it's versatile. It's amazing with a drizzle of dulce de leche on top.

I followed the recipe (though - like others - replaced 1/2 cup of the oil with 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also baked it in a single angel food pan. The cake took an hour to bake. I turned out very well, was moist and not too sweet. If I put a good caramel topping on it, it will be even better! (I am sure with powdered sugar it will be just fine.) Overall, a very good cake!

I Couldn't find my tube pan (which I never use anyway), so I used a 9X13 Glass pan for this recipe.  I decreased the Oil (used 1 cup) and Increased applesauce (used 1 and 1/2 cups) unsweetened, but followed the other ingredients, time cooked exaclty.  This turned out perfectly.  One thing I want to add though, to my surprise, and is a positive thing, is this cake is not like light and fluffy cake.  It is a heavy, wonderful, dense muffin-like dessert that comes out perfect from the pan, no sticking, slices without sticking to the knife and is just one of the best recipes I have ever come across.   I added some drizzles of simple vanilla glaze on the top to satistfy my youngest because of previous reviews said it wasn't that sweet, but I really don't think it was necessary.  This would have been excellent without the extra sweetness.  It is just sweet enough to satisfy, but hte extra glaze adds a little more for the ones who need to satisfy the sweet craving.  Had this as a dessert for my chili dinner tonite and my kids want this again for breakfast tomorrow! My youngest is a picky eater.  You could even make these as muffins, and they would be the best heaviest muffins EVER!  I will be making this over and over again. Thank you for this recipe.

I made this cake twice! I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it turned out delicious. The second time I added some pears that I had put in my ninja instead of applesauce. I also added some cloves. Best cake recipe ever..it never makes it to the end of the day!

Everyone in my family thought this cake was excellent.  I gave the recipe to my son who is a novice baker.  It turned out wonderfully.  I replaced a 1/2 cup oil with applesauce.  Baked in sheet pan for 50 minutes.  I made a rum-honey glaze.  1 stick butter, 1/2 cup honey, 1/2 cup rum, 1/4 cup apple juice.  Cook over medium heat, bring to boil, cook for two minutes.  Slowly a pour over cake, just a very little bit at a time.

Delicious cake,  not too moist and not too dry.  Good texture and pleasant taste that is not overpowered by a lot of spices.  I made it in a 12 cup bundt pan that worked out perfectly.  Hubs informed me that the recipe was a keeper. Thanks for sharing Coral.

I made this recipe and used a cream-cheese frosting with a touch of lemon juice in it, and it was a big hit! I made it for 10 ladies at a nursing home and they are quick to say they don't like something, but they actually enjoyed this alot. I even caught a worker licking the pan for the cream cheese frosting---the frosting made it so much tastier.

This is a fast & easy recipe that tastes wonderful.  I would like to mention that it does not call for 2 1/2 cups of oil, as someone stated earlier...but 1 1/2 cups of oil.  I baked mine in a bundt pan and it was marvelous!

I made this for my twin nephew's 21st birthday celebration (they love apple cake). I made it in a rectangular bundt pan and I did send up some offerings to the 'cake fairies' so that it would turn out of the pan!  It did!  So satisfying.  All the kids loved it.  The recipe did not state to beat the eggs with the sugar and oil- I did it and it worked!

Added extra applesauce and sprinkled dried apples for topping, and it came out light as a feather and absolutely delicious. Needed an extra 20 minutes cook-time. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and yummy!
I cut the recipe in half and used a bread loaf pan.  And I cut back on the oil (1/2 cup instead of 1 cup) and sugar (1/2 cup instead of 1 cup) and increased the proportion of applesauce (1 1/2 cups instead of 1 cup).  And it was done in 45 minutes.

Great cake and one of the easiest to make! Everyone loved it. I followed someone's suggestion to reduce the oil by half a cup and increase the applesauce by halfa cup. Makes a very moist, fluffy and light cake.

Good!  Made it in a 13 by 9 pan with less oil and more applesauce as well as less sugar.  Sprinkled icing sugar sparingly on the top.  Oh and about 1/4 tsp of cloves.

Perfect cake for the Fall. I followed the advice of other reviewers and I decreased the amount of oil to 1 cup and increased the amount of applesauce to 2 1/2 cups. I also added crushed walnuts to the mixture. 
Even thought this cake has 2 cups of sugar, I didn't find it overly sweet which I'm ok with. It was a hit and will be making again.

All I had were 2 cans of unsweetened applesauce, so I combined some of the other hints. Ended up with a spice cake with a taste of apples.Ended up needing 3 loaf pans (froze 2). 2 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce, 1 c oil, 4 T brown sugar, 3 t cinnamon, 2 t nutmeg,1 1/2 t cloves were my changes.

I made this cake today with the left over homemade applesauce I had in the fridg.  I only had 1 1/2 C's so I did not decrease the oil.  I made 12 cup cakes and one 9 inch round cake for the freezer.  The cakes came out perfectly lite in texture but tasted more like a spice cake. You wouldn't know there was applesauce in it.  I do plan to frost them with butter cream frosting when they are cooled.  I did taste a nibble from the corner of one of the cup cakes and it does taste good.  I will try these again sometime with more applesauce as suggested.

Exactly the recipe I was hoping for. Didn't want raisins or nuts (picky eaters in the house). Halfway into mixing I discovered my applesauce jar only had 1 cup in it.  Fortunately, I had apples on hand and shredded a few up.  Still turned out perfect.

This was very good. My husband liked it very much too. I did as the others recommended and substituted a half cup of oil for a half cup of apple sauce. I also topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting II. The frosting on it was wonderful!

The cake was too bland.  The recipe called for 2 1/2 cups of oil which is way too much oil.  I had to only put maybe 1 cup oil.  A substitution of 1 cup butter or margarine might of suited better.  There was not enough spice in the recipe.  Where is the applesauce? You can't even taste it.  Instead of powdered sugar, I think frosting will suit it much better and maybe add some sugar taste to it since you can't taste it in the cake.

I made a few changes based on what I had.  I cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us.  I used brown sugar (personal taste preference), increased the applesauce amount and decreased the oil amount.  I also added a bit of cloves and nutmeg.  I used an 8x8 pan and baked for about 40 minutes.  Once cooled, I glazed with a vanilla glaze and both me and my husband found the cake very tasty and moist.  Will make again.

This cake was quick and easy to make with what I had on hand.  Very moist and delicious though I also added more spices to my liking as well as  chopped walnuts since I had them.  I also followed the recipe as posted with the cup of oil since I only had the two cups of applesauce on hand and put in a bundt pan.  The cake turned out beautifully and smelled awesome as it was baking.  Very delicious cake, moist and dense.  I will definitely make this again.

One busy morning I decided to make a dessert to bring to a neighborhood luncheon. I didn't have sufficient  time to make this cake and have it cooled enough to bring so I used the recipe to make muffins instead. I used about 1/4 cup batter for each muffin and cooked them about 20-25 minutes at 350. I divided the batter to make 1/2 plain and the second half with walnuts and craisons. After the muffins cooled, I dusted the tops with confectionary sugar. There was enough batter for 24 muffins plus a small loaf cake ! Everyone liked the muffins.

Multi-step process for me; I made applesauce from the apples that I picked from the trees in my yard and used that to bake this awesome cake.  I did as others suggested, I increased applesauce by 1/2 cup and reduced oil by 1/2 cup.  I baked it in a bundt pan for 50 minutes, will try a 9x13 pan sometime soon.  DH requested cream cheese frosting, so . . .

I couldn't find my applesauce cake recipe so I found this one.  The first thing I thought when I looked at the recipe there is no way I'm using 1 1/2 cups of oil!
I used 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup of milk to replace the 1 1/2 cups oil plus I added nutmeg and allspice.  And I cut the sugar in half.
It was ready in 50 minutes and after letting it cool, I drizzled a simple  vanilla glaze.  It was delicious!  The extra spices made a difference, so flavourful.

I had two boys (7 & 10) each mix 'half' the cake. It turned out very good. I doubled the cinnamon though. Next time I make it I will only put in 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon.

Made this cake the other day for my coffee gang. Used a 9x13 & took the suggestions of a couple other reviewers. Used 1 cup of oil and 2 1/2 cups applesauce.  Dusted with powdered sugar. Everyone loved it.

I just baked the cake today. The only changes I made was lessened the sugar by like 1/4 cup and I used white sugar and turbinado sugar. It came out very delicious,moist and so simple to do.Would recommend this cake if you want a fast simple and delicious cake and serve with ice cream or whipped cream,

I made it but the batter bubbled out the top of the pan & dripped heavily onto the bottom of oven creating a smokescreen (even though I had a shallow pan beneath the Bundt pan). My guess is this was because 3 tsp baking powder & 2 tsp baking soda is too much.
...My wife just figured out what went wrong: we're in Montana at 5500ft ...so the 3tspBP+2tspBS was just too much. Cake was delicious even though 30% was in the pizza pan beneath the Bundt pan. Will make it again but reduce both the BP & BS.

The only changes I made was to reduce the sugar to 1 cup as I used my own homemade applesauce which was already sweetened and I used 2-1/2 cups applesauce and only 1 cup of oil.  Turned out perfect and my Bible Study class really enjoyed it.  I did use a maple cream cheese glaze also.  This recipe was so simple, just mix and bake.  Will definitely save to my favorites.

Wonderful recipe. Turned out beautifully. I did use the suggestion from another baker regarding substituting 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil and I added just a dash of nutmeg. Couldn't ask for an easier recipe. I did have to bake mine for almost 70mins. I'm not sure if that was due to the stoneware bundt pan I used or not. In fact, it rose above the rim of the pan. Does not matter. The cake was moist and delicious. I'm still debating on whether to use an icing or not since it is sweet enough without it. I will DEFINITELY be using this recipe again. Thank you!

I used all organic ingredients.  Einkorn Flour from Italy (American wheat makes me sick, but I can eat the Italian organic!)    Turbinado sugar instead of white, apple sauce made from my own tree!  And organic coconut oil.  Yum!   I am about to make a glaze with organic powdered sugar, butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest.  I can hardly wait for the pot luck dinner tonight!   This is the second time making this cake--there will be more of these wonderful bundt cakes in my future.

I adjusted this for our high elevation (8200') by making the following changes:
reduced baking powder to 1 teaspoon
reduced baking soda to 1/4 teaspoon
reduced sugar to 1 3/4 cup
increased eggs to 5
added 2 granny smith apples with skin, chopped
added 1/2 cup raisins
This is delicious.

Excellent recipe! I make homemade sauce with my Red Gravenstein apples here in the Pacific Northwest. The perfect icing for this cake is some softened cream cheese whipped with softened Harvey's hot buttered rum batter. Superb! Stores start selling the batter about the time eggnog comes out. Try it, they're made for each other !

This was an easy and delicious cake. After reading the reviews, I substituted 1/2 cup oil with a 1/2 applesauce. I also added 1/4 tsp. cloves. The cake was moist and wonderful! My family kept coming back for more. We will use this recipe again.

I really liked the way this cake turned out.  Very moist.  I have to say I did not follow the recipe to the letter.  I tweak it.  Instead of using all of the oil, I used 1 cup butter, and 1/2 cup of the oil.  Enjoyed it very much.  Oh and I made my own applesauce.  Thank you for sharing.

This cake recipe was AMAZING, even with the significant changes I made: BLENDED (fresh) STRAWBERRIES in place of applesauce, mixture of melted BUTTER & COCONUT OIL instead of vegetable oil, and I nixed the cinnamon. I had lots of strawberries on hand, and couldn't find a good strawberry cake recipe (most called for strawberry flavoured jello and not real strawberries!), so I had a feeling a recipe that a cake recipe that used applesauce would work just as well.

This is an easy recipe and it absolutely delicious.  The cake is light and moist, I made into loaf tins.  I'm going to make a toffee sauce or frosting to cover the others.  Will definitely make again.

Family ate it up in a 24 hour period! I traded a cup of oil for a cup of applesauce. Oh, and tonight we added three bakers chocolate cubes! Super chocolaty and Super good!

I had a jar of sweetened apple sauce that I wanted to use up, and decided to try this recipe. 
I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and substituted 1/2 cup of oil with 1/2 cup of apple sauce. I also added 1/2 cup of raisins.

It looks very nice, but it took 90 minutes to bake! After 60 minutes it was all raw batter inside.

I used whole wheat flour and I cup of oil with an extra 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I think I could reduce the oil by another 1/2 cup and increase the applesauce.  Made them into muffins, cooked about 25 minutes and it was a bit too long.  Made lots (three muffin tins, don't remember how many in each tin...)

I just got done making this and took the others advice by adding the extra applesauce and cloves. Yummy! I will make this again=) I ended up having to bake it for 55 min. You might have to adjust that time though.

I adapted this recipe for 9 servings and baked in an oblong pan. It was fantastic; very moist and very light.

This cake was lovely and moist, but was not sweet enough for my tastes. Granted, I didn't follow the other reviewers suggestions and didn't add the 1/2 cup of extra applesauce in substitution for 1/2 cup of oil but it tasted rather bland and not very appley. It has great potential and with a few changes could be an excellent cake. I may possibly try it again but I will change a few things and see how it goes.

Excellent recipe.  Very moist and easy to make.  I used a stoneware bundt pan and had to increase cooking time a bit, but it turned out wonderful!
