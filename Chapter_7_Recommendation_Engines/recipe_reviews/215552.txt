I just tried these for the first time and I am a little disappointed.  They are not near as good as my great-grandmother's recipe for icicle pickles.  It was fun to try a new version and do a side by side comparison, but from now on I will stick with our old favorites (which takes longer and has a stronger syrup).  I followed the recipe except that I omitted the food coloring, as I didn't think it was healthy to add the extra dye.

My cucumbers have been very bitter this year and I hated to waste them all to the compost heap so I tried your recipe in the hope of salvaging them.  

Now that they are canned and cooling on the counter, I am prepping for the next batch to which I plan to add some hot peppers for a little zest.

Not only did your recipe eliminate the bitterness, the pickles are yummy! I am a little bummed because all my jars sealed so I won't be putting a dud in the fridge to snack on. 

I need more jars :)

I loved them!  These pickles are well worth the time.  I put more blue than green food colouring to copy the old copper colour!  Who wants to use a copper scrubby or copper sulfate, lol!  Thanks for the great recipe, I looked and looked for one!  These make wonderful little gifts and look great with pared with the Christmas red pickles!
