I made 31 (!) dozen of these cookies for Christmas Cookie exchanges.  They have a wonderful, unusual taste and are so easy to make.  Instead of dipping the cookie in chocolate, I drizzled on melted white chocolate--the contrast between the dark cookie and the light chocolate was lovely.

I've been making these cookies for years and are a favorite in my family.  A couple tips:  the cookies are best if not over-cooked.  Make sure to slice them a generous 1/4" thickness and bake them only until the edges have a slight firmness when touched.  They will then cool to a light softness.  Secondly, if making lots of cookies, you'll want to occasionally rewarm the dipping chocolate.  This keeps the dipped coating from getting too thick and ovewhelming.  I sometimes also dip just an edge in the chocolate, rather than half the cookie.  This makes just a tease of milk chocolate.  Lastly, I put the dipped cookies on wax paper and chill them for a bit before storing them.  This keeps the dip from sticking when stacking cookies.

I think I'd cut down on the shortening in the chocolate mixture - it didn't seem to harden quite enough for easy storage - and I upped both the coffee and cinnamon because the dough seemed a bit bland. They turned out reasonabley tasty in the end, but not phenomenal.

If you like a cookie that is not too sweet, this is a great cookie.  Yes, it looks like a fussy recipe, but it's not too much work.  I usually mix the dough up one day, wrap it, and then bake it in the next few days when I have time. This is the same recipe in the Taste of Home "Best of Country Cookies" cookbook, a cookbook I will never part with, ever.  You can vary the intensity of the coffee flavor by choosing either a dark or light roast instant coffee.  I just made these for a cookie exchange and I used two packets from a box of Folgers Fresh Breaks, Black Silk (dark) single serve packets. The coffee flavor really comes through and will be made even better with a thin coat of chocolate.  If you like a nice mocha, give this one a try!

I thought this recipe was delicious. I had to make a last minute substitution on the instant coffee as I was unknowingly out. I used 2 tbsp. of french vanilla NescafeÂ® iced coffee syrup and a teaspoon of finely crushed regular coffee. The next time I make it I probabably won't dip them in the chocolate - maybe just drizzle some white chocolate on. The chocolate coating overpowers the delicate, yummy cookie for me - I've been eating the chocolate half first so I can savory the plain side last!

A nice change from plain chocolate cookies, I added 1 tsp vanilla and halved the cinnamon, I also used cocoa and butter (1 tbsp butter and 3 tbsps cocoa for 1 square) for the unsweetened squares as it is something I don't usually have around.

These cookies are amazing!  Have made them several times, and they are always great.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla, because I thought they needed a bit more flavor.  They are always a hit, and eaten up as fast as I make them.  You will love these cookies!

Good cookie. I used all margarine for the recipe (instead of shortening/butter) and served with vanilla ice cream. I did not drizzle chocolate on the top but thought they tasted just fine without it.

Delicious.  Added more spices (cinnamon, nutmeg).  Have also made using molasses instead of coffee.

These cookies came out greasy and tasteless. I substituted the chocolate squares with unsweetened cocoa and oil like the side of the can said. Maybe that was the problem. yuk.

My daughter and I made these for grandma and she LOVED them. These were quick and easy to make with my daughter since I did all the prep work the night before. I sliced and she placed them on the sheet,but her favorite part was dunking them in the chocolate.

I make these every Christmas. You have to like coffee flavor but they are easy and the dough can be made ahead and refrigerated or frozen until ready to bake.

Got this recipe years ago in print and after making them every Christmas for decades, I lost the copy I had.  Glad to find it here.  These are so popular in my extended family that this mocha cookie has become my signature cookie. Def use the shortening in the cookie and not all butter...the shortening helps them to hold their shape. Use a good quality chocolate for dipping.  Thanks for saving my holiday baking!

I've made these a number of times and they're always a hit.  Love the fact that you can mix them up one day, slice and bake a second day and even ice them on a third day if needed!

My mom started making these cookies about 20 years ago and it's been a Christmas tradition ever since. We mix up the type of chocolate we dip them in. We dip some in milk chocolate, mint chocolate, white chocolate, peanut butter, and butterscotch. They are always a favorite at holiday events! We always store them in the freezer.

This is definitely a different cookie, just what I needed to round out my traditional christmas cookie lineup. I tried one before I dipped them in chocolate and thought it was just okay. But once it was dipped... it was perfect! A great balance of flavors. I used confectioner's chocolate because it was one step. The only thing keeping this from being a regular in my home is how many steps it has. This is a time consuming cookie to make. I knew this going in so I'm not disappointed. If you want something different, this is it!

This cookie is so easy to make and perfect as is.  Another reviewer suggested drizzling white chocolate on top---that would be mighty tasty!  My whole family told me "Coffee cookies...ew!"  but once they tasted the cookie, they LOVED it!

Mmmm...delicious! Brought these to a party and everyone loved them, even the kids. Crunchy, not too sweet, very good cookie.
