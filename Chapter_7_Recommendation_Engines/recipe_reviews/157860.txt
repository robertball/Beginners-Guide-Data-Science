I didn't have a green pepper so I used fresh mushrooms but green pepper would probably taste good also.  This is what I did:

First of all, I did not use the olive oil.  When I told Grumpy it called for olive oil he told me not to do it, that you should always use butter when cooking venison.  (Yeah, he's my venison "expert" so I have to listen to him!)I sauteed the mushrooms(would have done the same if I had peppers).  When they were cooked down I removed the mushrooms from the pan and sauteed the venison.  I added the mushrooms back to the pan when the venison was cooked, mixed in the soup mix with 3 cups of the water.  I mixed the other 1/2 cup of water with 2 TBSP flour.  I found this was not enough flour to thicken this to gravy, so I added a little less than 2 TBSP more flour with just enough water to make it smooth.  You should always mix the flour with the cold liquid you are going to add to the hot boilng liquid in your pan to prevent lumps.  

Thanks for the recipe!  It is great for a night when you don't have a lot of time!

responding to Kay's review!!   To get rid of the gamey taste just soak meat in water, keep chan ging the water until it runs clear (no blood left) and gamey taste is gone!

I too used the changes made by Grumpy's honeybunch but with one more change. I used Elk instead of Deer.  I could not believe how tender the meat was.  My husband who is also an avid hunter loved it.  I will definitely do this again!

My husband loved this!!!! He said the gravy that it made was the best venison gravy he had ever had. I had to make a few alteration,s due to what I had on hand. I used a package of pepper and onion stirfry mix, so I browned the venison first, then added the stirfry, and I had no onion soup mix, so I added beef base, and added onion and garlic powder. He has been raving all night long about how good it was, and when will I make this again. Thanks so much for the keeper. PS. I have some venison that we canned I think I may try it with that. It is so tender, even before I put it in a pan.

I followed the steps in the review by Grumpy's Honeybunch (thank you, I've never thickened gravy without lumps successfully before now)and also omitted green peppers (yuck) and added fresh mushrooms. Overall this was good but I felt that the gravy was kind of lacking in the flavor department. Otherwise this was enjoyable and most importantly, fast. I will make it again and next time I may try marinating and/or adding different seasoning- something to give it some kick.

My husband and I loved this. However,I did make a change. I didn't have a dry soup mix so I used a can of cream of mushroom soup, two spoonfuls of sour cream and a splash of milk. I also seasoned my meat with garlic, tony's and black pepper. This meal was quick and delicious!

Great, easy recipe, but it can be even easier.  I did this in the crock pot (6-8 hrs. on low)too omitting the oil.  For flavor I added 1 beef bouillion and 3/4 t. or so of winter savory, which helped bolster the flavor nicely. The meat was fall apart tender.  To make the gravy, which there is alot of, just mix water and flour together til smooth and add to hot/boiling liquid.  Great over mashed potatoes or egg noodles (my son hates mashed potatoes.) Thanks for a great easy keeper.

I had large steaks.. about an inch thick (size of both my hands laid flat) and I didn't have the soup it called for. I cut steak into 1/2 inch cubes, cooked with one med red onion and one white onion chopped, and cooked in 1 stick butter with 3 med/lg fresh garlic cloves. added 1 red and 1 yellow pepper roughly chopped and rough chopped thick mushrooms when meat was half done.. covered/simmered low about 10min (stirring a time or two). uncover and added cream of potato soup, cheddar soup, and one can of milk. the only seasoning I aded was about a tsp of fresh cracked pepper. I didn't need the flour since I used canned cream soup. it turned out nice and creamy and not gamey (cut into small pieces for the 'flavors' to go all the way through) We liked this the best of the venison recipes! Thank you for the suggestion :) (I rarely stick directly to a recipe)

I always just use a little oil, a little water for simmering, large onion, salt and pepper to taste and a little butter at the end to brown, but I wanted to try something different...This is a good recipe...however the cook time is way off. Raised in PA I've ate deer meat all my life and cooked it for 30 years...you can NOT get deer steak tender in 15 minutes. I slow fry mine in a non-stick skillet for at least 2 hours and brown it right before serving...so tender you can cut with a fork! Plus for those who said it still tasted "gamey"...use more onion...so yummy!

We enjoyed this very much!  I am new to cooking deer meat, so I was happy this turned out well.  I didn't use quite as much water as called for, and we added mushrooms.  The meat was tender and had great flavor.  It's a keeper!
