These turned out great and were super simple to make. I thought they were going to be a bit bland but there were not in the least. Excellent recipe!

This recipe is good as is! It is very similar to the Greek Chicken Breast from this site. Make the recipe as is and adjust to the desired doneness and golden color of your preference.
