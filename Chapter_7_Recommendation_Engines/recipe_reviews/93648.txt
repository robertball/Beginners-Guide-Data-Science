Excellent tasting and fairly easy.  I only used half the recipe on Christmas.  The next night, I added another half jalapeno to the mixes...a bit more spice.

2007 update - I made these again, but instead of frying them in oil, I baked them for @ 15 minutes at 375. Turned them over and baked for 5 more minutes. Still very yummy, but a bit better for us.

Wow, these were good!  Even my picky 10-year-old loved them!  I made just a couple of minor changes.  I added an overflowing tablespoon of canned cranberry sauce to the mix for a better body and color.  I also baked these at 375 for about 15 minutes in my convection oven, spraying the tops with olive oil spray.  I never fry wontons - too much fat.  They were very crispy and good!  Thanks for a great way to use up both cranberries and jalapenos!

I'm the one who created this recipe, but I've made it a few times since I submitted it here and I would like to note that I've added a little red curry paste (about 2tbsp to the cranberry relish) to it as well and they turned out wonderfully! But don't try this if you don't like your food spicy. I really hope you enjoy!

This is a great recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving, and we loved it. The flavor combination is so interesting. Next time I make this I will add more cranberries, and might bake them in puff pastry instead so they don't have to be served immediately.

I wish I could give this 6 stars! It was a HUGE hit at my annual "fall" coctail party. Also, I made the wonton part first and froze them on a cookie sheet. I made the "relish" part in the morning. I was able to simply fry them up at the party. So So yummy.

My kids aren't fans of spicy things, so I left out the jalapeno and just added a few sprinkles of curry powder.  They turned out great!

I did try baking a few, as another reviewer suggested, to see if we liked the healthier version.  They tasted OK, but the filling flattened out leaving a large air pocket in the wonton skin.  Several wontons also leaked filling all over the cookie sheet.  Healthy or not, the fried wontons looked much better, so if you're concerned with presentation I'd definitely fry them.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was not well received.  I followed the instructions, and it just turned out blah.  I was looking forward to this because I like wontons & spicy food.  I will not be making this again.

I love this little recipe because it gave me the idea to use a raspberry chipotle sauce (bottled from Costco) instead of cranberries to make this. The combination of sweet and spicy is just wonderful.

Wow.  From the ingredients, I knew that I was going to like this, but I didn't expect for my entire party to like them.  I come from a family of picky eaters who don't like to stray from the family usuals, but when I brought these everyone was so intrigued that everyone tried them... AND LIKED THEM.  I've been asked to bring these again and again.  Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe.  I might try adding different stuff to the filling, but I went by the letter on the recipe the first time and it was awesome. *****

Please do NOT try to bake these, you will be utterly disappointed!  I did that and the wonton wrapper turned out chewy and just unedible.  I guess I did save calories because I just threw them all away.  I loved the filling, would even serve it as a dip or relish.  Was fairly easy to assemble once you get into a rhythm.  I will possibly attempt again & will fry them next time.

Wonderful recipe!  Made for the first time and can't wait to do it again.  My parents and neighbors loved it and said "this is a keeper"!  This is not as spicy as I thought, but still held the jalepeno flavor - which makes this recipe nice to serve to a wide variety of people.

FANTASTIC!  My only complaint is that I didn't double the recipe.  All my guests raved.  I pinched mine into "purses" instead of triangles, great presentation.  Thanks!

These turned out so well.  Everyone asked me for the recipe.  I made them without the jalapeno (due to the people eating it, I would have loved that.)  I also put all of the mixture in, rather than saving some for dipping, and used phyllo dough instead of wonton wrappers since I couldn't find them.  I baked them like some of the other reviews suggested.  Overall, these were delicious and I can't wait to make them again!

These were very easy and tasty.  I added 2 more jalepeno's because we like our food spicy.  They were devoured by our friends. A definite keeper.

Ok, but nothing special.  I would recommend seeding the jalapeno though, we didn't & it was very hot.  If my hubby would've wanted to try these again we would seed the pepper.

Fantastic. I'm not a cranberry lover but found these to be delicioua. Loved the jalapeno flavor as well-it was just the right amount of spice. Will definitely be making these again.

These are fantastic!  I was a little hesitant at first, since I'd never heard of this particular combination of foods, but the flavor is delicious!  I once made the recipe with a small can of diced green chilies, since I didn't have a fresh jalapeno, and the puffs did seem spicier than when I used the jalapeno.  Both end results were great, it just depends on how much kick you want in your puff.

These were just okay.  All I could taste was the jalapeno, the cranberries added color, but not much else.  The sugar didn't make it sweet.  I could've just mixed jalapenos with cheddar and cream cheese and left out the other ingredients.  Wouldn't make them again.

I don't like spicy foods too much so I only added 1/2 a jalapeno.  It turned out great and everyone loved them - a nice change from  the crab rangoon that we usually have!

I was unsure of the ingredient combination, but these were WONDERFUL!  I tool them to a party and they were a huge hit. I fried these, but I am going to try and bake them tonight.
UPDATE: Baked is just not as good.

These were great! I like spicy food so I added 1/2 a habanero pepper in addition to the 1 jalapeno. Next time I will add about 1/2 cup more cranberries for a sponger cranberry flavor. Big hit with my friends.

This recipe deserves 5 stars because it is so fun to make and it's delicious. I put in a whole jalapeno in and it was generally felt to be a little on the spicy side but I really enjoyed it. The folding of the wanton wrapers was my favorite part. My roommate and I looked up a video on different shapes to fold the wantons and then we made various creations. We also brushed the wrappers with water to make sure that they stuck and stayed together.

Fantastic! I deseeded the jalapeno to avod making them too spicy for my guests but I'm not sure it needed it. After they were all done, I sifted some powdered sugar on top to add a little visual appeal & an extra touch of sweetness. And I used nuefatchel cheese. These were my favories of all the appetizers I served for Thanksgiving...I think I will repeat them for my family's Christmas get-together. Thansk Raelee's recipes!

Yummy these were good.  I used a jelopeno relish from Harry and Davids for a dipping sauce and used the almost all the mixture instead of half.  Very good thanks!!

These were awesome. Everybody loved them. Just be careful not to overbrown, they cook quickly. Make lots!

These were a huge hit! I thought people might be put off by them with the mix of cranberry and jalapeno, but I made a very large batch and they were gone in minutes! However most people ate them without the cranberry relish.

This receipe was WONDERFUL.  I made this for a holiday gathering last year and I couldn't make them fast enough.  Even the people who don;t like spicey food loved them.  I prepared them ahead of time then fried them as I served them.  They are best when served immediately after frying.  I will be making these again and again and again.

I made these for New Years Eve with my food processor I got for Christmas. I loved them - I seeded the jalepeno so they weren't too spicy  I think next time I'd like them spicier. 

My mom didn't think they'd be very good and she liked them, and my dad and brother LOVED them (I didn't think they would). I said I'd make them next Christmas and he said "No! Don't wait that long!"

I'm not a fan of frying things though, so I think next time I'll use a fry daddy or something like that.

When I returned home from the grocery store with the ingredients for this recipe I must say my husband was rather skeptical about them, but I am pleased to say he ate pretty much half of them.  They reminded me of a nice twist on a jalepeno popper, very good!

i wasn't sure about the cranberry/mayo/jalapeno combination so i went for sweet and left those out and sprinkled a little grated white chocolate before sealing them up.  very nice for the holidays.
