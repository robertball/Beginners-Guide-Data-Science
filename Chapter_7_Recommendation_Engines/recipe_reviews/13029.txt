Its always disappointing when a recipe gets high marks but the reviewers suggestions are what REALLY make the difference. This could have easily been a 5 star recipe had I read through half of the reviews. 

The two key issues I had with this recipe:

Calling for milk. It should just be changed to half and half or cream - because the milk seperates - which is not at all appetizing.

Having the bacon in from the beginning. The result is almost like an uncooked texture by the end. It should be cooked, kept aside and almost added as a granish upon serving. Leaving the bacon fat in at the beginning stage will impart the flavor and not sacrifice the bacon's texture instead.

Granted - I should have instinctively not done both of these things - and will amend if I make this again.

Wow, this was an amazing corn chowder! I did make a couple changes:

I cooked the bacon in the soup pot until it was crispy, then removed the bacon and sauteed the onion and celery in the bacon fat. I crumbled the bacon and added it back at the end to keep it crunchy. I found I didn't need to dirty two pans for cooking the bacon and then simmering the soup. I omitted the butter and definitely didn't miss it! Also I drained the can of whole corn and I peeled the potatoes (it wasn't clear in the recipe if I should).

All in all, the best corn chowder I have ever eaten!!

I used butter in this recipe instead of margerine and I also used homemade chicken broth and evaporated milk instead of regular milk (the reason for using canned milk in this recipe is it doesn't seperate when cooking which regular milk will do). The thickness was spot on. After tasting it, I did add a few spices but there wasn't much adjustment needed. I made Bacon Cheddar Muffins to go with. This was a nice, filling dinner.

some previous reviewers are saying this chowder is bland....here is the way i did it and it was not bland at all...sub half and half for milk, use good quality chicken stock (wolfgang puck makes a decent inexpensive one)I added a splash of low vinager high heat hot sauce and some smoked paprika. also instead of a flour paste(?) I made a cooked roux with the grease from the bacon probably about a quater cup of flour or maybe more for a rich chowder. The way the recipe reads it is very thin. add plenty of salt too. try and see whats up..yum yumm very good base recipe though

I have been trying to find a good corn chowder recipe and I happened to think this one sounded the best.  As it turns out, this soup was absolutely excellent.  I have never made corn chowder before but I have eaten a lot and I would rate this as one of the best I have had.  I did change the recipe a bit by adding garlic in with the onion and celery and using cream instead of milk and omitting the flour.  Also, next time I will brown the bacon all the way before adding the veggies.  However, all in all this recipe was great.  Thank you so much!!!

Yummy!!!  In reading the reviews and then the recipe again, it calls for 4 cups of broth = 2 CANS...  Before catching this, I used 3 cans!  I also used the frozen corn as others stated as well as half & half instead of milk.  I added the flour to the half & half to thicken it too. Next time I will use all yellow frozen corn, the white made it a bit too sweet and I will double the celery.  Usually not fond of cooked celery, but it was excellent in this soup.  Everyone loved it, thanks for the great recipe!

I thought it tasted great. I used crumbled sausage instead of bacon and a can of cream of celery soup instead of celery. Very simple :)

Ok so following many others I did what was suggested. I browned my bacon first, then removed from pot and saved for the end. I then browned my onions and celery also using a few dashes of garlic powder(or fresh if on hand). I then added my stock after about five minutes and then proceeded with the potatoes and carrots and a can of creamed corn, I let this boil for a bit and another burner warmed up about a cup and a half of half n half. Once I added my cream I then added about a cup of frozen corn as I think it has a much better flavour than canned. And to thicken I did not use a roux but instead keep these perfect little portioned packages of dehydrated mashed potatoes(the kind you would add your butter  and milk too...) I find these are a much better thickener and have the yummy taste of potatoes as opposed of a floury taste. I seasoned with some crushed black pepper as it did not need salt. Perfect!!

Thank you for a delicious recipe.  I made it today and I LOVE it.  The only reason I changed anything was to make it vegetarian.  I left out the bacon and used vegetable broth.  I also cut the fat a bit for health reasons by using skim milk and light butter, leaving out the bacon helped with that too.  Nutrition changed to 142 cal, 1.9g fat, 0 cholesterol, 4.82g Protein, 599mg sodium and 2.2g fiber.  The soup came out very creamy, better than most I have had out at restaurants.  Thanks again.  :)

This was a good chowder.  I would suggest to cook the bacon separatley and add it in right before serving, this way it doesn't get too rubbery.  I sauteed the onion and celery first and then added the chicken broth.  Then I added the potatoes and carrots.  I only used 3 small potatoes and threw in a large red bell pepper.  After the veggies were tender, I added the milk, then the flour mixture, then the corn.  I used the canned cream corn and 2 cups of frozen white corn.  I added dill weed and garlic powder.  Served with garlic bread.

This is a great recipe...for all of you "health conscious" chefs, you can heat up your 2 cups of milk and whisk the 3 heaping Tbsps of flour into it before pouring it into your soup and the milk wont separate then and it's SUPER creamy still (I also used about 2 1/2 cups of broth instead of 4).  Also I use ham instead of bacon...again quite a bit healthier.

Good flavors to this soup.  Tastes better after it sits for a few hours.

This chowder was just amazing! I basically followed the recipe, but added a small diced red pepper and a couple cloves minced garlic to the onion/celery saute. I used condensed milk (1 can)in lieu of the milk, added a Tbsp. chopped fresh thyme and garnished with the bacon and some chopped scallions. With only 3 of us eating, we each had 2 nice bowls with dinner and I was more than pleased to still have 3 servings left for the next day's lunch. Thank you Halle Hardin ~ and you to, Gramma Brown!

My gang went nuts over this and when my future son-in-law calls something I make "gangster" I know it's amazing!!  I made a roux instead of the paste by adding the flour to the bacon and vegie mixture.  I also added some cayenne as my family likes things spiced up a bit and because I had it on hand I threw in a couple of cups of shredded cheddar. So delish and thank you!!

This came out quite good, after I changed a few things.  First, I browned the bacon (I used Turkey Bacon - less fat!) in a large Dutch oven.  After removing the bacon with a slotted spoon, I tossed in the onions with a bit of flour for about 2-3 minutes.  I also added a few chilies (We love spicy food).  Then I added carrots, bell peppers, celery and potatoes with the broth, and I also added some thyme and sage with the salt & pepper and simmered it for about 15 min until tender.  Then I added diced ham, the creamed corn, and a can of peaches & cream corn for more extra corn flavour.  As well, instead of milk, I added one can of evaporated milk.  To make it thicker, I used a bit of soup base with cornstarch - works better than flour.  Add the bacon last and heat through.  It came out great!!!

excellent. only changes were that I substituted half of the milk for half and half (don't think both cups need to be half and half) and added an extra can of creamed corn-- as some said it wasn't creamy enough. used some leftover smoked bacon- and let it all sit on low for 3-4 hours after was cooked through, to blend soup. excellent. you could spice it up a bit with some peppers or spice- but I thought it was good as is. will definitely make again.

Used turkey bacon, fried up pretty crisp and added during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  1 1/3 cups cream and 2/3 cup skim milk adds richness and a little extra flour for thickening made it very yummy!

This was simple and easy to make, and tasted great. I cut the recipe in half and used one can of creamed corn and no whole kernel corn. I also left out the celery and just added a little celery salt.

I really liked this recipe.  It definitely allows you to season it up the way you want... was really bland for my family.  I followed a reviewer's advise and used Hot Sauce/Buffalo Wing Sauce for flavoring right into the chowder.
I froze some for later and can't wait for a cold blustery day to pull it out!

And I give reviews 5 stars!!! So the changes in the reviews are absolutely right, sub cream or half and half for milk and never soak bacon for 45 minutes, you'll regret it.  Personally, I leave the bacon out all together and fry the onion and a red pepper in olive oil.  I probably add to many carrots too, but they are good for you :) Great start, just make it your own.

As is this is a 3 star in my book, just okay. I ended up adding a lot of spices and herbs, some cheeze, and an extra can of creamed corn and it was a lot more flavorful. But without these Im afraid its rather bland. With these additions, it is very yummy and will please the company and could be a 5 star.

This chowder is so darn good!! I have been looking for a great chowder and this is it! The bacon adds so much flavor. Like the others suggested I add the bacon crumbles at the end so they get less soft! Wonderful chowder!!

This gets 5 stars although I did not add the bacon (was cooking for a crowd who does not eat pork).  I added a few drops of liquid smoke to the soup to give it some flavor it would miss by not having the bacon in it.  It was AWESOME.  Good recipe and I will make this again and use the bacon!

Excellent recipe!  I only added an extra can of broth (3 instead of 2), probably because I added more potato than what the recipe called for. I also used corn starch w/ the milk, instead of the flour paste (personal preference), and an EXTRA large can of whole kernel corn. Everyone who tasted had rave reviews... Thank you for submitting recipe.

I was amazed at how easy this recipe was to make.  It was the first chowder I've made.  I did make some changes, based on the reviews, though.  I cooked the bacon and then put it aside, to be used as a garnish later.  I used the bacon fat to cook the chowder and keep the flavor.  Then I used half-and-half instead of the milk.  It turned out nice and creamy...perfect for a cold Texas night.

Delicious. I too cooked the bacon and set it aside for later as a garnish and used half cream and half milk instead of all milk. I still used the bacon grease to cook the celery and carrots. I would say it could use another can of corn, or better yet, frozen corn. Another thing I would say it needs is more kick, or spice. I added paprika, garlic salt, chile powder and a bit of season salt.

This was easy to make and quite tasty!  Only small changes I made were to cook bacon first and add back in at the end and I used half and half instead of milk.  Will make again for sure.

This is wonderfully full-flavored!  My husband couldn't believe how much he loved it; I made the recipe exactly as-is, and the two of us finished it off in three days (10 servings!).  A wonderful winter dinner.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I read the reviews of this recipe and the suggestion to set aside the bacon until the end is bang on. I threw in an extra cup of frozen corn, and thought it was great. Even better the next day.

Excellent! I had to use a combination of diced ham and real bacon pieces for the bacon, but it was still flavorful. I also used half evaporated milk and half regular milk, and cornstarch (4 Tb. mixed into some of the milk) in place of flour for my gluten-free daughter. I do recommend using low-sodium corn and holding the salt until the end, because there are a lot of salty ingredients and it is hard to adjust. I am not a fan of celery, but I think the celery in this gives a wonderful taste. And COLBY CHEESE-- not cheddar-- puts it over the top for a rich elegant variation! This will be my new standard chowder.

Great recipe! I changed a couple of minor things. I fried the bacon and removed before sauteing the vegetables. I used the crumbled bacon on top when serving. I also added some cooked diced chicken to "beef" it up a little for the family.

I picked this recipe( never made a corn chowder before) since it seemed like the easiest one that I could play around with. I learned a couple of things while doing so: 1) I love spicy foods so I thought it wouldn't hurt to add a pinch of chilli powder, but I would not recommend it; it overwhelms and doesn't match with the soup. 2)Water was fine in lieu of broth, but if you use the liquid in the cans, cut it down from 4 to 2 c. 30I only had regular corn, no creamed style, and it was still fine. 4)If you do puree it, don't add the carrots; the carrot flavor dominates then. 5)I used milk and it was fine. 6) Omitting the bacon and sauteeing in a little oil is still great 6)Next time, I'll try it without the butter.

We loved this one.  The only change I made was using half and half instead of milk simply because we had it and it had to be used.  It was superb and I would do it the same way again.

Excellent corn chowder. I suggest stir-frying the onion, celery in the margarine while the bacon is cooking and then adding the chopped vegetables, broth and bacon to it. I prefer to fry the bacon and then let it cool on a paper towel to get rid of as much fat as possible. This is a soup that we will be having again. Thank you for the recipe, Halle.

I pretty much follow the recipe for this, it is very good as written!  Over time, I’ve made it my own by putting all ingredients in the crockpot (except the milk) and adding 3-4 boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I set the crockpot on high for 4 hours, then remove and shred the chicken and return it to the pot.  Then I add (I use evaporated)milk and flour mixture.  In place of salt and pepper, I use Morton Season Blend and a Tuscan herb blend.  I like to make this in early fall and freeze the leftovers—it makes a hardy winter meal served with biscuits.

We really enjoyed this soup. I've had a tried and tested corn chowder that I've used for years so I was rluctant to try a new one. I am so pleased that I gave this a try. I tink the secret is to cook the vegetables with the cream corn. At first I thought that was a missprint but it is the secret. We found it thick enough so didn't have to add flour paste. Give this a try , you won't be disappointed.

My family loved this, I followed other suggestions and used evaporated milk and left out the butter.  I also added my own twists and used fresh sweet corn (4 ears) and added 2 small salmon fillets (no skin, cut into chunks), and it added a great layer of flavor.

This recipe is very good. I did make a few changes. I put in 2 cans of cream corn. I had some cooked cobs of corn, so I used the corn off the cobs instead of the cans of kernel corn. I used some salt pork broth instead of the chicken broth just because I had it & I used 2 cans of low-fat canned milk. There was no need to use the butter & flour as the soup was just the right thickness.

Most of the people I served this to LOVED it.  Sadly, my main audience was my daughter who thought it was too sweet. I need a recipe without creamed corn.

Really good. The entire time he ate hubby kept saying how good it was.:) Changes made-fried bacon, crumbled and saved to put on top of the chowder after it was done. Also used lots of black pepper and red pepper flakes to give it a kick.

Loved it! I will make it again. Enjoyed knowing I had the health of some vegetables, some some "man" heartiness with thickness and the bacon (and I added diced chicken). Very filling, didn't need more than one bowl. Followed others suggestions of half and half instead of straight milk (although milk would be the healthier option). Muy bien!

Just made this yesterday and it was very yummy! I read the reviews before making and did remove the crisp bacon and then served on top as garnish. I also substituted half & half for milk. Additionally, I added some shredded rotisserie chicken from the grocery store to make it more of a meal. Chowder came out delicious and I will definitely make this again.

Yum!  Gramma Brown makes a mean chowder!  The only changes I made wre to double the cream corn and use cornstarch instead of flour.  This was very flavorable and tasted yummy with the cheddar bay biscuits from this site!

Just a comment, not a review - 'cuz I haven't made it yet: I think this would be wonderful with diced green chilis instead of celery. (Nothing against celery, just don't think they'd go well together.)

First, to the reviewer who left out the celery and bacon, and complained about seasoning.... you need BOTH in this soup. (AND celery in EVERY soup)  I added a bay leaf, simmered it for much longer than called for here, and it was a great basic recipe. I will probably tweak it a bit next time, but very good!

My family loved this.  I fried the bacon first then kept it out till last.  I also added an extra can of whole kernel corn.  Due to milk sensitivities I used only 3/4 cup of milk but increased the broth and flour to compensate for the liquid.  Great flavor, will definitely make again.

My apologies to everyone who doesn't read the reviews... my rating is definitely based on cooking the bacon first and setting it aside until the rest of the soup is ready.  I too fried the bacon in my pot and left the fat instead of adding butter.  VERY TASTY.

Pretty good after I made some adjustments according to other reviews. I removed the bacon to add as garnish later, subbed half and half for milk and added a few drops of tobasco for extra kick. I also hit it with my immersion blender to get that super smooth texture and added some leftover roasted corn at the very end. It's tasty, but doesn't have as much corn flavor as I would like. Next time, I'll cut down the potatoes and increase the corn.

Good basic recipe. Just used 5 strips bacon and used fat free half and half for the milk.  Mashed up some of the potatoes and because of gluten issues used corn starch to thicken.  Also, used chicken stock, more robust flavor than just using broth.  Added a few red pepper flakes to give it some kick and lots of fresh ground pepper.  Family loved it.

Try looking at food network, there is a simalar recipe on there by Ina Garten. This one is a little lacking in good direction!  I loved the idea of a previous reviewers idea about making a roux instead of the flour slury! The chowder is very good!!!!! DO NOT ADD BACON UNTIL THE END OR IT WILL GET SOGY! I love this site, but trust me, look at the Ina Garten one and compare notes!

Nice soup on a cold, windy day!  I left out the celery and sauted the onion and a few tablespoons of garlic in the bacon drippings.  I added some extra flour/water because I prefer a thicker soup.  It's definitely good though I might try a different chowder recipe next time.

Good corn chowder. After cooking the bacon, remove from pan, crumble and reserve till the end to put it back in the soup. I also added garlic to the onion and celery and used creme instead of milk and omitted flour. I added chopped chicken and a cup of cheddar cheese. Yum!!

This was my first time making any kind of chowder. The recipe was easy to follow and turned out great. I would have found a little more guidance with the flour at the end helpful. We had these dumpling-like things in the chowder from the flour but they were not bad tasting. I just think that I must not have done it all the way right. Oh and, I will save the bacon for the top next time. It lost some the favor and texture that I love about bacon. Other than those two things, the chowder is absolutely delicious and we will be making it again.

I, too, made a roux by adding 1/4 cup of flour to 1/2 of the bacon drippings.  I added 1 tsp. smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp. parsley flakes & 4 slices deli honey ham, diced.  I also drained the bacon after cooking & added it as a garnish to keep it's crunchiness.  After all that it was a really delicious soup!

Very easy - I did add some spices, whatever I had on hand. I made a chicken pot pie with the leftovers. I added some shredded rotisserie chicken and stuck it between two rolled pie crusts. Easy and super yummy!

My son came home on leave and said he wanted me to make corn chowder, he had tasted it at a friends house up in Washington State, I had never made it before, but thought this recipe looked like something our family would like. We LOVED it!!! I made some little changes, I used half and half and I cooked the bacon in the oven, added the crumbled bacon to the soup and as a garnishment. I sprinkled the bacon ontop  of some grated cheddar cheese, right before I served it. With some french bread it was a really great dish.

Awesome!  Don't want extra fat?  You can use skim milk and then a potato - not half and half - to thicken.  Boil one extra potato, puree, add in broth until it creates a slurry.  Add to soup as thickener.  Reserve the bacon for a topping - consider adding chopped green onion for a topping, too.  Kids like to add shredded cheddar cheese as third garnish.  I still use flour and otherwise follow the recipe.  Very wonderful and filling.

I have made a version of this recipe for years using sausage instead of bacon and using cream instead of the rue. My whole family loves it. Also have made a quickie version using frozen O'Brian potatoes with peppers and onions, works great and tastes great.

out of this world fantastic!   I am adding this to my list of soup recipes to consider to serve in my restaurant.   
We love it.  I didn't change it at all, but I wasn't sure about the canned corn so I drained it.  I think that my assumption was right.  
I'm enjoying a bowl of it right now.

This was just okay for me.  My family loved it, but I thought it was rather bland.  I took the advice of others and saved the bacon until the end and used frozen corn rather than canned.  Maybe if I make it again I will add some spices or something, I dunno.  Just 'eh' for me.

My husband loved this chowder. I made a few changes, I used 1 pound of bacon, added a couple cloves of garlic, and seasoned with red pepper flakes and white pepper. I also used corstarch to thicken the stew instead of the flour mixture. All the changes I made were really just for personal preference. I'm sure the chowder would be just as excellent in its original recipe! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Made a few changes. Used turkey bacon, fat free broth, skim milk, and corn starch to cut down on the calories. Added oregano, rosemary, a bay leaf, and lots of pepper while cooking. 
With all the revisions, came out great!

Great soup, but I made a few changes per other user's suggestions:
Used 2 cans regular corn - will try frozen next time.  Added 3 cooked/cubed chicken breasts.  Used half and half instead of milk, but I still thickened it quite a bit with a flour/water mixture and even added 1 can cream of chicken.  With added changes, this is fantastic!  My family gobbled it up and it was the first to go at a soup pot luck.

Good recipe; split this in half and still had more than enough.  As suggested by someone else, drained off the bacon prior to browing the onions.  Sub's I made: didn't have cream-style corn, chicken broth, or milk; added extra frozen corn, used water with leftover roasted chicken, and used a can of cream of chicken soup for the creamy/thicking agent.  Needed quite a bit of pepper, red pepper, no salt, used a little nutritional yeast too.  All in all, with my revisions, really good.

This was really good. I was looking for something quick and easy for a cold Sunday lunch and this hit the spot!! I changed the recipe a small bit, I added smoked sausage instead of bacon because that was what I had and my pot was too full so I couldn't add the milk, but you wouldn't know it should have been there, it was fabulous, oh and I added an extra can of kernel corn. GREAT RECIPE!!!

I thought this soup was wonderful.  I did however make some changes to suit our tastes.  I only used one onion as we are not big onion people.  I added a can of green chiles and 1/2 tsp. of red pepper, didn't think any additional salt was necessary.  I used frozen corn as suggested by previous reviewers and ended up using a little over 2 cups.  I also used 3T. flour to get to desired thickness.  We topped it with a Mexican 4 cheese blend, diced jalapenos, avocado, and cilantro.

This chowder was hearty, but not very flavorful.  It was fairly quick and easy, but I think it could use some spicing up.

So very good!  I did take the advise and used frozen corn instead of canned and I'm glad I did.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out great.  No muss, no fuss.  Easy weeknight meal in no time!  New Family Fav.

Best corn chowder I've ever made. I used equal amounts of carrots celery and onion, probably 1 1/4 cups. Used fresh frozen corn about 2 cups or more (I like corn). Added velveta like others suggested. Took it to work and received comments like "fantastic."  Thanks Halle and Gamma !!

This recipe was very tasty! I will make it again but next time I will cut the bacon into smaller pieces and will probably cut the recipe in half.  It took me longer than I thought to prepare the ingredients and I used a food processor for everything but the potatoes which worked nicely.

I have never had corn chowder before but this was awesome!!! We loved this!!! I followed the recipe to the letter but added 4oz velveeta cheese about 10 min before completion.  I didn't want the cheese to take away from the rest of the soup but THIS WAS GREAT!!  Will make this again!! Very hearty stuff! Thanks Gramma Brown and Halle too!

This was a good recipe. I used velveeta cheese to thicken the soup and give it a little cheesy taste instead of flour.

This was super-easy to make and oh-so-yummy!  I added some stir-fry cuts of chicken breast, which I sauteed with the bacon once the bacon was pretty-much done. That's it.  And now we have meals for the next couple of days!

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except like everyone else, I just cooked the bacon in the soup pot. No need to dirty an extra pan. And I waited to add the bacon back in when the soup was served.

This is really good chowder.  As others suggested, I used half and half, did not leave the bacon in while cooking vegetables but added to top when serving the chowder.  I also sauted the vegetables in the bacon grease, added a really great flavor to the soup.  I also added some chicken to it at the end. I will most definitely make this again! Love it!

I thought this was good, but could have been more flavorful. I followed the instructions exactly except I subbed out the milk/flour mixture for heavy cream (which I don't think would have negatively affected the flavor). I think next time I'll try with more bacon and fewer potatoes to see if that helps.

9/17 Made as is for family dinner and would make again! Hearty!
1/19 Fried the bacon on the bottom of the soup kettle, tonged it out, fried the onion and celery in the bacon grease, left off the butter. The burnt bacon parts incorporated into the soup and gave it a gray tinge. Add the crumbled bacon right before serving. DH had 4ths, everyone loved but E. Sigh. I lied and told her the celery was peppers.

lovely recipe, Ive made a few changes that I think really amp up this corn chowder. I add cubed ham and add over a cup of shredded cheddar cheese :) 

Important that after you make this soup, when reheating you should never bring it back to a boil as it will definitely curdle

Served this over the holidays and it was a big hit!  After reading some of the reviews, I used half and half rather than milk, butter not margarine and yellow potatoes.  Definitely will be part of our standards.

I have a been making this recipe for years, and my entire family loves it! The only adjustment I always make is that I add smoked sausage. There’s never any leftovers we love it so much!?

I also made a roux with flour and milk in the bacon grease, and I kept the bacon to the side and crumbled it on top of each individual serving so it stayed crispy. Even without the bacon though, it was delicious! Thank you for sharing, even my picky son loved the taste-minus the carrots-he has a texture issue (?) Ha! Give this a go, you won't regret it! Happy cooking!

I liked this recipe.  It doesn't say it, but chop the bacon up[ first.  It's easier.  Also, the thickener was way understated.  I don't know of anyone who expects corn chowder to be watery.  Nice flavor.

I really like this soup.  I make it as written except I use 4 Tablespoons of flour to thicken it instead of 2.  The soup needs about 2 teaspoons of salt to give it a nice flavour.  Thanks for a great soup recipe.  I've gotten great compliments on it.

Really like this, just with a few changes. Listened to the comments, and kept bacon out. Used the fat to cook onion and added garlic. Then made a roux instead of adding a flour slurry later. Used half and half instead of milk. Would definitely make this again.

10/18/15 ~ Delicious! I made the recipe using all of the ingredients listed, but I added the bacon before serving. We do not like the texture of wimpy bacon. The soup was very good and the presentation was very pretty served in an 'Italian Bread Bowl', recipe from AR. The next time, I will go a little heavier with the salt and add some pepper. My DH added Tabasco to his dish. Great recipe, worth trying.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves it.  After following the recipe exactly the first time I decided it needed an extra can of whole kernel corn.  I also used thick cut bacon and baby red potatoes.  I haven't tasted anything better out of a can or at a restaurant.

Best corn chowder I've had in awhile. Made 1 change for the better. I used corn starch instead of flour. Flour seemed to clump as it hits the hot liquid, corn starch doesn't.

I added shredded cheddar cheese on top of each bowl for extra little taste.  I also add leek to hide the onion that my husband does not eat (he thinks!!).  Plus a clove or 2 of garlic.

I didn't read the reviews and panicked after my bacon was already bathing in the chicken broth.  I still think it turned out well.  I added a little cream cheese and jalapeño powder for a richer flavor.  If I would do anything again I'd actually add more corn.

This chowder was excellent!  Based on on other reviews I made a few changes.  1) whole pound of bacon!  I cooked this at the beginning but didn't add it in until serving so that it would still have some crunch.  2) Used fat-free evaporated milk to save some fat and avoid the milk separating.  3) I used corn starch instead of flour to thicken.  
I made this for a soup cook-off at work and one first place!

I baked bacon and it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it to be. But very tasty and I plan on making it again.

The recipe was easy to follow.  I use bacon end pieces since these are thicker and I find they have a better flavor.  I added 1/2 in 1/2 since it doesn't separate like milk.  For seasonings I added celery salt and thyme along with the pepper instead of salt, to give it a nice country flavor.

Tried and true recipe, I make it exactly as the recipe calls for except I omit the bacon (it gets all rubbery and gross). Also, definitely use butter.

Thought it was clear, and to the point. I just changed the procedure of cooking. Plus, I added a couple if ingredients to tweak it just a bit. Only thing I would change is how you word the cuts on the ingredients. All the cuts should be uniform, and all should be to the bite. Meaning, you should be able to fit all ingredients on to the spoon. Delicious, and I would use this again. Thanks!

This was very tasty. Like most people I read the reviews before trying it out and took heed to ingredient changes to enhance the soup. First off I used a can of cream style white corn hoping to get the sweet flavor a little. Also a bag of frozen yellow corn. Added two and a half cups broth. Red, yellow, Orange and green peppers along with broccoli and cauliflower went in. For a dark color change I added black beans. Chopped up 5 honey gold potatoes and one full Turkey sausage. Mixed the flower with almost two cups of half and half. Added salt and pepper. Sprinkled shredded cheese and bacon and was good to go. Great recipe. Next time I do believe I'm going to add a spoonful or two of sugar to get a sweeter taste. John also I added Japanese chilli seeds and tomatoes with green chili's. Gave it a spicy kick that warms you up nicely. Will def make this again and soon!!!!!

I omitted the bacon and added garlic and bell pepper with the onion and celery - sauteed in butter instead of bacon grease until onions were clear. I also substituted evaporated milk and two cans of regular corn (not creamed). After it was all cooked, I used my immersion blender to cream it all together. It was delicious and looked beautiful. My picky husband really liked it. Thank you for the recipe!

This was a very good chowder and relatively easy to make.  I agree with another reviewer in which she said to cut up the bacon so there aren't full strips in the chowder.  I put half the bacon in the chowder and used the other half as a topping.  I also topped it with green onions.  Yummy!

Why didn't I cook the bacon and reserve it for a garnish, like I always do?  
As I was going along, I did use the bacon grease and added the flour for a roux. Then added broth and corns.  I pureed half the mixture for extra creaminess and less chunks.  Added the milk at the end...its good, just wish I reserved the bacon like reviewers said.

I made this for dinner tonight. My husband, who is not health-conscious, said it was "so-o-o good!". I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used half and half for the milk and I also sauteed my celery and onion in 2 T. bacon fat and omitted the butter, and saved the crunchy bacon to add in at the end. When it was done, I was surprised at the blandness of the soup after using such savory ingredients, and I thought the corn was way too sweet for the soup.  I tossed in some chopped red bell pepper and added more salt, pepper and paprika, then added a little Velveeta cheese. It helped a little bit, but perhaps I should just try something like a "loaded baked potato soup" recipe, or another kind of chowder that doesn't call for any sweet ingredients.  Just my personal taste I guess, because Hubby just went back for another big bowl. In retrospect, it would have been fine just to use the half and half for part of the milk, as the resulting soup was very rich and fattening. I could easily see children loving this soup for the same reason I didn't care for it. I gave it 4 stars for my husband's reaction; it would have been 2 stars for myself.

Outstanding Corn Chowder!  I added some minced garlic when cooking onions and celery, added some red pepper flakes to chowder, and used evaporated milk.  One of the absolute best soups I've ever made!

This is great soup; very thick and rich. Instead of potatoes, I had some cauliflower I just had to use and it was awesome in it! I also substituted corn starch for the flour and I left out the bacon (not a huge fan). I did use the half and half that was recommended by others, but I think next time I will use just milk with the cornstarch. I think the soup itself is very flexible as far as putting your own twists on it.

This soup was very good, although I did use some of the suggestions made by other members (hence, four  stars).  I substituted bacon grease for the margarine, used frozen corn instead of canned and made a roux instead of a flour paste. I also used a can of evaporated milk & about 1/2 cup of cream (substitute for milk).  In addition, I added some shredded chicken breast meat.  (Didn't notice until I got home from the store that I purchased canned sweet corn instead of creamed corn, so I made my own creamed corn using canned corn & then added it to the soup.) It was tasty!!

I made several key changes--first, I crisped the bacon in the soup pot then removed it and set aside. I used the bacon fat to sauté the celery, onion, celery seed, and some fresh garlic I had. Then I added all the veggies (canned and otherwise) and let them toast for about 10 minutes. I added the flour to the veggies until the flour was toasted and golden (sort of like a roux) and added the liquid. I used evaporated milk and cream instead of milk. Then I added the bacon when it was ready to serve. Everyone loved it and I've made it several times.

Wonderful recipe.  I have made this vegetarian style, omitted the bacon, added leek, used soy milk and almond milk (different occasions) and each time I am asked for the recipe.  I added a dash of Mrs Dash, McCormick seasoning salt and pepper flakes when sauteeing onions, leek, celery in a little butter.  Just a quick reminder that recipes can be followed to the tee or jazzed up to your taste...does not mean it was not a good start.
Better than any restaurant or store bought.

I used half/half instead of milk and doubled the corn and creamed corn. I omited the carrots since I had never seen a corn chowder with carrots, instead I added 2 more potatoes. And ditto what the other reviewer said about adding the bacon as a garnish before serving. It turned out wonderful! I almost doubled the recipe but didnt as this made a huge pot of soup!

Fabulolous soup!  After cooking bacon, set it aside and use some of the bacon fat to saute celery and onion.  I used one cup half and half and one cup skim milk.  The crisp bacon added on top in bowls at serving time works great, with chopped parsley or chives for garnish.  I can see how the basic recipe can be tweeked.  Next time, I'll try all milk, no cream and I'm sure it'll be good.

Honestly could have done without the bacon completely, maybe just using some bacon grease to saute the vegetables instead. I also added some red pepper flakes.

Great meal for a lazy sunday afternoon!  I left out the celery because, well, I always leave out the celery- also left out the bacon.  While this recipe was good, it did need something.  That may be because I left out the bacon, but I felt like it needed some seasoning besides just salt.

This tastes great and makes a great soup for a cold wintery day.  I used three fresh corn on the cob instead of the canned corn. I boiled the corn and then cut if from the cob. I also boiled the potatoes on there own and then mashed them and added them to the broth mixture. Because I mashed the potatoes I did not have to make a paste. The soup was creamy and wonderful tasting. I also used my epicure spices, (bacon, chives and cheese) and chicken bouillon base for extra flavour.

This is an Awesome Chowder.  I modified the recipe slightly by sauteing the onion, carrot and Celery in the bacon grease, and adding minced clove of garlic. All gooking was done in 1 pan - a Dutch Oven. I also used 1 can of condensed milk and topped off with enough regular milk to make the required 2 full cups. Additionally, I made my own chicken stock, and used that. It's a longer overall process, but worth the effort. This version was an instant favorite in our household.

I only gave this four stars because I like chowder to be thicker. Changes I made was made a roux with 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour cooked for 1 min then add 2 cups milk. I also add some shredded carrots.

I have made this AMAZING Corn Chowder a number of times for my partner.  Her childhood favorite as her Granny made it for her.  This absolutely came close to Granny and has become a favorite Good for The Soul Soup.

Thanks!!!

This is real comfort food, my lads all loved it.
 Yes, I made it with half the broth, but found that I needed to add a bit more later on in the cooking. Apart from that the only change I made was to add parsley and Thyme, just because we like them. 
Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe

Good, better with 1/2 teaspoon dried basil, 2 cloves crushed garlic and instant potatoes to thicken instead of the flour rue.  Add some of the bacon grease for flavor, or browned sausage with or instead of the bacon.  Adjust salt accordingly.

This was a really good recipe. My son actually ate it and he's a picky eater. I think next time though I'll just use whole kernel corn instead of creamed corn. Thats a matter of taste though.

really good corn chowder. since i never follow a recipe all the way, i did a few things different. i sauted the carrots with the other veggies in a little bacon grease and used leftover ham instead, and added a little yellow pepper i had left over. i cooked the potatoes in the broth with the other veggies before adding the creamed corn and other ingredients.(makes the potatoes a little more tender.) turned out wonderful. thanks

Excellent chowder. Just a couple of modifications: cut the bacon in half and you'll barely notice a difference, and if you like a milky chowder vs. a thick, creamy chowder, it's great without the flour.

This recipe was simple and hearty, but was tastless.  My boyfriend said he added hot sauce to it and that helped, next time I'll just get my mom's recipe.

Pretty good recipe.  I made it all in one pot...cooked the bacon, removed it to drain....took almost all of the grease out of the pan before adding onion and celery.  I added 1 1/2 teaspoons ground red pepper, did not include the carrots, and doubled the flour/water amount.  Added the bacon to the chowder while it was simmering just ten minutes before serving . My husband loved it...the red pepper was subtle but needed.

Wonderful! I browned the onions and celery in butter at the beginning and added pre-cooked crumbled bacon, a bay leaf, and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper with the milk.

This soup was missing something. It was fair, it just needed a little more flavor. I tried adding cheese to some of the left over, but wasn't enough. It needs seasoning or something to give it a kick. It also has too much of a milky taste, not creamy enough. I also don't think the cooking instructions allow for it to cook thouroughly, I had to cook for at least 45mins to 1hr to get the potatoes to cook all the way through.

This was excellent.  I pretty much followed it exactly except I used Wondra flour to thicken it up a little more.  I also added some fresh parsley.  My family really enjoyed it!

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this  soup!!! As suggested, I made a few changes- 3 cans of broth instead of 4, used half &half instead of milk, added some chopped red bell pepper for color, mashed half the potatoes to add thickness, and its sooo delicious!!!! I also used frozen corn and added some extra. YUMMY!!!

This was really good but it is missing something. Maybe it's me. I work at a restaurant with an excellent executive chef who makes a gorgeous corn chowder. I think I may add a little bell and jalapeno pepper to this next time. We did like it a lot though.

I made this chowder today as a course of our Thanksgiving dinner and it was fantastic.  Everyone was raving, even the picky kids who wouldn't even eat the stuffing!  The mistake, however, was to use it as an appetizer - this should be served as a whole meal.  We didn't have bacon, so we diced some ham and salted and sautéed it to obtain the same sort of flavor.  We also substituted half and half for the milk and left the carrots out.  Be sure to mix your flour paste with enough water to make it soupy.  My first glob boiled into a solid hunk of dumpling, I had to fish it out and try again.  This will definitely become a regular on our menu.

Real good chowder!  The recipe doesn't say anything about the bacon grease, but I drained almost all of it.  Yuck, don't need that much in my soup!  Doubled the whole kernel corn and only used 2 cups of broth (we like our soup THICK).  Mixed 1T of flour with some of the milk for a little thickening.  And, better than flour, lightly mashed the potatos in the pot.  Pepper, parsley, and oregano made good seasoning.  Might add a bay leaf next time.

This recipe is easy to make, and it tastes great. I make it often, and it's always a big hit around the house. 
 
Another plus, the ingredients are cheap: you get a cauldron-o'-yumminess for under 10 bucks.

I added a little cumin, crushed red pepper and red or green bell pepper to give it a more spicy, southwestern flavor. It was good.

Although not the best chowder I've tried, this was still a good recipe, and others enjoyed it as well. I did cut the bacon into pieces before frying it though, and the thickener paste didn't work for me, so I took out a cup of the broth and let it cool, then whisked in 1/4 cup flour and stirred it all back into the soup. Very good!

WOW. Outstanding! I cut up some chicken and sauteed the chicken in butter and lemon juice then added it to the corn chowder. This is probably one of my family's favorite dishes!! Absolutely delicious! THANK YOU!

Excellent recipe!  I have been making this recipe since winter (forgot to rate it) and it is, by far, one of my favorite recipes!  This is a very hearty, flavorful chowder and it's quick and simple to cook.  The only thing I did differently is replaced the canned corn with 1 1/2 cans of frozen corn.  Thank you for a delicious recipe.  I LOVE IT!!!

I've had this recipe for almost a year and we have all liked it every time I've made it.  I have added 4-5 slices of Velveeta and have used red potatoes (with skin).  I also add oregano, rosemary, basil and lots of pepper to this chowder.  Very good.  Oh,I don't thing I've used the bacon, I always forget to buy it.

Very warm and inviting comfort food.  Easy to make, too!  I used cornstarch instead of flour for the thickener.  Goes wonderfully with cornbread.

I made this for a lunch party and it was a great success!  I thickened it a little more than what the recipe called for and I added some diced hard boiled eggs.  I also added an extra can of creamed corn (I love a lot of corn and I like my chowders thick).  This is now a perminant addition to my recipe box.  Thanks!

Fantastic! I omitted the bacon and substituted the flour and milk with some light cream.  It was delicious!  My family and co-workers loved it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

Great taste. Was a little soupy at first but I added more flour. Will make again and add more pepper for a kick.

Very Good.  I omitted the bacon and added a little chicken to the soup.  I also added a little garlic and used white pepper.

What a wonderful soup. I added the 4 ounces of Velveeta others recommended (even though it tasted darned good without it). To compensate a little for that added fat, I cooked the onions and celery in a bit of reserved bacon grease and later added cooked turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. This hearty soup is just as good or better the next day (it does thicken up overnight, which was fine with us).

I have never had corn chowder before and after looking at a lot of recipes, I chose yours.  It is delicious.  I have emailed it to a couple of friends because it is so good.  I made it exactly as you said and will certainly keep this in my family cookbook.  Thank you Halle for submitting this great recipe.
