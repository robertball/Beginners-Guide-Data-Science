So Yummy! Don't pass this one up! The flavor is great. I used 1 bag of milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet squares. Great recipe!

I love the taste of these, very easy, versatile, great snack for when you have a huge sugar/chocolate craving and don't want to eat huge amounts because its very satisfying. But, the amount of sugar in this recipe is ridiculous, I put half the amount in my bowl and tasted it, it was too sweet already. Really do add only half and try it that way, I think you will agree.

I was looking for a quick and easy sweet treat and came across this. It was exactly what I was lookingfor - easy, really yummy and I had everything on hand to make them. I upped the peanut butter to 1.5 cups and used 1 cup of natural of 1/2 cup of regular. I had them made in 5 minutes and they were ready to eat after 20 minutes in the freezer.

These are so incredibly easy and delicious!    I put most of them in the freezer to pull out as needed.  I will make these again.

I had my husband take these to work and they were gone fast. They taste like homemade peanut butter cups! I used choclate chips instead of baking squares which I think is easier because they melt faster and more evenly then broken up squares.

These are really really good!They taste similar to a Reese's cup but I think a Reese's cup is sweeter.It's a keeper.

Pretty darn good - I think they're almost as good as a Reese's! The flavor and texture reminds me of a Buckeye.

What an easy, scruptuous (and RICH) dessert! I used a 12 oz. bag of chocolate chips instead of the chocolate squares -- easier to melt. You definitely need to score the chocolate before completely set -- I forgot, so the chocolate cracked in spots when I cut it. But that didn't affect the wonderful result. My family loved this dessert, and I'll definitely put it in my favorites file.

These were the best! I made them for Christmas and they were a huge hit with my chocolate loving family. The only thing I would differently next time is use a little bit smaller of a pan. We love the chocolate a little thicker. Otherwise they were just like peanut butter cups and they were easy to make. Will make again!!!
