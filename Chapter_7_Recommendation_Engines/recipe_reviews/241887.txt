My Oma used to make these when I was a child, it brought back very fond memories of time spent with her.
I halved the recipe because I wasn't sure my sons would like it, one did and one didn't, I think it was the texture of the filling as he has texture issues.
For the cream cheese I used 1/4 of an 8 ounce block, I have never seen a 3 ounce package in Canada.
For the 1/2 egg yolk I took 1 tbsp egg yolk from the crepe recipe.
I omitted the salt as I used salted butter and I didn't drizzle melted butter over the finished Nalesniki but served with blueberry marmalade I made.
I used the Basic Crepe recipe from Allrecipes which makes 6 crepes with a 1/3 cup measure.
Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Pretty good and not overpowering. I did use Vanilla Crepes and Breakfast Blueberry Sauce off AR. Maybe a different sauce next time.
