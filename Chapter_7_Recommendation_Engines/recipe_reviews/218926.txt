These cookies were delicious! I made two batches in the same day for a Bacon Bake Off at my job. I made some slight changes to the second batch which I thought made them more my style (thinner, larger and crispier). I left all fat on bacon and used about 1/4 cup of the bacon fat mixed into the butter mixture. Doing these two things gave a more balanced taste, as I felt the first was a little too sweet. I also nixed the salt the second time and only used 1T water for the glaze. I also used a heeping tablespoon to portion out cookies and they were large and delicious!!! Pics included :)

Awesome recipe, thanks for sharing!!!

I made these breakfast cookies the other day.  My family has alot of diabetics, so I made these using Splenda and reg. bacon.  The glaze I made using Log Cabin sugar free syrup and they turned out just great.  I found the next morning when I tried one that putting it in the microwave for 10-15 sec. warmed it up just enough to make it really yummy.  For a diabetic I could see having a serving of Egg beater scrambled eggs and some fresh fruit to make a complete breakfast.

These cookies are the BOMB!!  I always try at least one the night before, if it's a new cookie, to make sure I don't need to whip up some chocolate chip cookies instead.  I had to stop myself from eating another and another.....VERY good cookie!  Oh, but I only needed one Tbspn of water in the glaze.  1 1/2 made it too watery.

I thought these were really good!  I baked them for exactly 10 minutes, as I think they remained a little chewier since they were a bit under-done.  I accidentally read the directions wrong and added almost an entire pound of bacon, which I didn't discover until after tasting...though I think I'll do the same thing next time, because I thought they were perfect as they were.  I probably wouldn't feel the need to add the 1/2 tsp of salt, and would use unsalted butter if I were going to include that much bacon again (though I didn't think they tasted too salty, I'm sure the Sodium count was probably fairly high with all of those factors together).  I also added 1/2 tsp maple extract in addition to that amount of vanilla.  I made the glaze, but did not care for it, as I notice is my preference regarding powdered sugar based glazes.  I just brushed a bit of real maple syrup across the tops and they were perfect. :)

Awesome flavor! The bacon added just the right touch of savory to the sweet cookie. I have added raisins for a touch of fruit, as well as mixed fruit bits to make the thing a truly complete breakfast with a glass of milk! Delicious!

Some people have mentioned that their cookies are spreading and coming out thin and crispy. You can avoid this if you cool your dough longer. I usually do it for at least 4 hours.

These are SO easy to make and absolutely delicious!!  I used most a jar of bacon bits because I was being lazy about the bacon.  While the cookies turned out very, very good, in retrospect I think cooking and dicing bacon would lend a far more bacon flavor to the cookies, so I'll do this next time.  And, oh yes, there WILL be a next time!!

I made this recipe as written, minus the glaze.  My cookies tasted amazing, however they spread something terrible.  Will add a cup of flour with next attempt.   A new classic for this family.  Thank you!

These cookies were fantastic! I made a double batch and got around 75 cookies for the size of the balls I made. Like another person suggested I added 1tbsp of maple extract and also brushed a SMALL amount of real maple syrup on top of the cookies before baking them! So yum!

AWESOME!!!
My husband did not want to believe me when I told him it has bacon in it. He took some to work and everybody loved them! 
I sticked exactly with the recipe except I did not form small balls of dough but dropped the dough on the sheet with 2 tablespoons and flattened with a fork. Worked out well. The recipe is definitely a keeper!

I've made these twice. I made these the night before Thanksgiving so everyone would have something filling to snack on before Thanksgiving meal was ready. My fiance and kids love them. The only thing I don't like is the maple glaze is very sweet...almost makes my teeth hurt. I made again on a random day just so my fiance can have a grab and go type of breakfast for the next few days. This is a winner.

Well, at work I am known as "Betty Crocker" for the wonderful baked goodies that I enjoy baking.  These cookies are my co-workers' favorite.  I do add chocolate chips, walnuts and craisins to really make this a great cookie.  Add a little rum (vs. water) to the glaze for an even better surprise !!

Best oatmeal cookie! I add a little extra bacon and cook it crispy so you get that nice flavor and crunch. I do some with and without glaze. I recommend using a bit of butter in the glaze for a better flavor. The main picture on here shows a clear runny glaze, I make sure my cookie is cool and my glaze is thick so there's no run off...its just prettier.

Far exceeded my expectations and was a big hit with the hubby.  The extra half a cup of flour is needed to keep them round.  Otherwise I didn't change a think, except my second batch was doubled!

These were amazing!!! Didnt change a thing with the cookie recipe except that I baked them at 350 instead (my oven tends to run hotter). I made my own version of the glaze however. I used 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tbsp maple syrup, 1 tsp melted butter, and 2 tbsp water. It was a good consistency and had a good flavor balance. Not too sweet. Next time I'll be doubling the recipe!

Just made these for snack between services at church.Everyone loved them. I cut them in half to share better. Made half with the maple glaze and 1/2 with just 1 tsp maple syrup on top. Both were great. I made the glaze with just 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar and the maple syrup. Definitely will make again.

Yummy, but didn't think they were out of this world. Next time may try adding a bit more bacon. I refrigerated my dough overnight and perhaps it was too long--my cookies certainly don't seem to have spread quite as much as other people's did. I baked mine for about 15 mins before they looked done, might have been related. I may try another reviewer's suggestion of brushing maple syrup across the tops instead of the glaze instead--I found the glaze to be too sugary.

However the guests at my brunch devoured these, so clearly it was a crowd-pleaser!

Well, this essentially is a flat muffin. I love bacon, so I suggest frying the bacon and just serve it on the side. While the taste was good, I think I would do just muffins next time.

This was one of the best cookie recipes that I have made. Moist and chewy .  A nice thick cookie with the saltiness of bacon and the sweetness of maple syrup.  Everyone loved them.

I made these for a Halloween party that had a bacon theme (everyone was asked to bring a food item containing bacon to share).  I colored the icing orange and they definitely made a great presentation and conversation piece.  The flavor was great but more like an oatmeal cookie - the bacon was just a hidden ingredient.

So very good aside from what you would think. Even  the skeptics loved them.  I used splenda sugars instead. Brushed tops with maple syrup. Yummy.

sooooooo good! I used turkey bacon, diced, and fried in a pan on the stove top; 100% (white aka lighter grain) whole wheat flour; and 3 parts butter to 1 part canola oil. I had to bake them a little longer than I expected until the edges just started to gently brown, but they are still delic and moist this morning. will be using this recipes again for sure  :)

The hardest part of this recipe is not eating the bacon before it goes into the dough.  I suggest making extra!

do a test batch first, and make sure that the suggested serving size is appropriate for what you're going for. The 1/3 cup suggested service size is a little big for a cookie. The recipe in and of itself is delicious though.

I will not make these again.  I did as instructed and they were good but no one could taste the bacon though I even added some bacon grease to the dough.  So, I think a much healthier alternative would be oatmeal cookies with raisins or cranberries.  I see no reason to add the bacon - certainly no health reason.  (May I say the dough was awesome - ha! - just not a healthy alternative to breakfast.  If I have bacon, I want to taste it. )  Thanks to all.

I  will probably make these again but with some minor tweaks.  They were good but the consistency of the baked cookie was a little off - the bottoms were dark and the middle was undercooked.  I will definitely bake them at 350° instead of 375° and I'll also flatten them a bit more.  By the way, the recipe says 1/3 cup dough per cookie.  That would yield a ginormous cookie and probably only about 6 or 7 cookies.  I'd say that a 1 inch ball is about right.  Overall, good, unique flavor with a sweet/salty combo that I love.

It tastes very nice.  Was a big hit with my sister.  I won't describe it as a breakfast cookie.  It has a lot of sugar in.

While I loved the flavor, I wish I would have known how to check when the cookies were done.  At the timing giving in the recipe the middle of the cookies were VERY gooey still and I baked them longer resulting in overbaking.  Whoops.  The flavor was great, but I also added chopped bacon to the glaze :)

We made these for our employees Christmas gift baskets, and now my girlfriend has a standing request to make them for everyone. They enjoyed them that much.
We made 2 batches, one with bacon and one without.

These are really good!  As I type this review, I'm making my second batch.  I
I'm never hungry in the morning, but take medication which requires I take with food and these - I can definitely handle eating in the morning.  My husband really liked them also and he is totally a bacon, eggs & pancake kinda guy! I was actually a tad miffed when I went to the pantry to get a couple one morning, a few days after I made them, and they were all gone!! LOL

I used thick sliced hickory bacon that I always buy. I think I would use unsmoked bacon next time. We had a bacon party this past weekend where everyone made something with bacon. These cookies were a huge hit! Everyone loved them.

These were awesome!  I left off the glaze because I thought they were sweet enough without it.  I used 6 Tablespoons of softened butter and 2 Tablespoons of bacon grease instead of the 1/2 cup of butter. Other than that, I made them exactly as written. Everyone in the family loves them!

Very easy recipe. The cookies lasted about 20 minutes and everyone was looking for more. I only changed the glaze I like to use heavy cream instead of water or milk with the syrup. Looking forward to more fall cookies. Like anything pumpkin or apple

Everyone loved them! They were way sweeter than expected and I made my bacon extra crispy to bring out the flavor. Next time I’ll use more bacon and may use maple syrup or extract in the cookie itself. I felt like I was over baking only for them to turn out perfectly. The recipe makes a perfect two dozen cookies scooped with a medium cookie scoop. They do spread a bit while baking.

These were easy to make and good, but I kept waiting for the raisins while eating them.  I used Jimmy Dean's Applewood bacon and you really couldn't tell you were eating bacon in the cookies.  My husband asked what the crunchy stuff was in them.

This was awesome! The only thing I did different was I halved the amount of glaze. We don't like super sweet glaze, so I just drizzled a little bit on top of the cookies. I also only got a dozen out of it instead of 1.5. Maybe they were too big? I did 1/3 cup as directed, actually a little less. The only modification I would make next time is to use less salt, the bacon is plenty salty. Thanks!

It was delicious. Loved the taste of bacon with the sweet cookie. My only negative comment is that the cookie came out fairly thin and fragile. I think next time, I would not flatten it as much as I did.

Soooo good. I'd say the icing needs a little extra maple, or some extract in the glaze or cookie. But still a 5 star in my book.

I made these for my bacon loving man and he went crazy for them! Followed the recipe exactly( except for doubling it) and they turned perfect.
