Wow.  This recipe was fantastic!  And I overheard everyone at our brunch commenting on the "amazing bacon." :)  The only change was to 1/2 the amount of dry mustard powder; this gave it a hint of mustard without overpowering the other flavors.  We'll definitely be making this for other get-togethers in the future!     ----- Update:  The leftover rub from this recipe is out-of-this-world on salmon.  Just rub onto salmon filets and then grill til done.  It's our new favorite way to eat salmon!

After cooking this for several years, I have some advice to make it quicker and less messy:
1) Don't worry about twisting the bacon.  Cut your packs of bacon in half, shake them in a bag of the brown sugar mixture, and then lay them very tightly packed onto an aluminum foil covered cookie sheet that has been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  They taste so delicious no one cares if they are twisted or not!
2) Immediately after removing from the oven, put each piece on cookie cooling racks that have been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  Don't let them touch! I also put wax paper beneath the racks because that praline mess will drip.  Let them cool and set.
3) Just add 1 tsp. of allspice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg. The clove adds something extra, just like when you stud ham with whole cloves.
4) Use the cheapest bacon you can find and definitely not thick cut.

Everyone in my community loves this recipe and it has become the dish that is asked for the most when I attend parties.  A friend of mine's son had some serious medical problems lately and he said that Candied Bacon would make him feel better! This bacon cures everything!

I used thick sliced bacon, so 30 minutes didn't get it crispy, but it didn't matter, I thought these were great.  Just the right amount of spice with the cayenne.  I used a big baggy to mix the spices in and then threw the bacon in which made it really easy to coat it.  Yum!  A fun recipe.  Thanks!

We tried this for brunch this weekend and it was a huge hit.  My daughter affectionately renamed this "Candy Bacon".  Best to cook it on a broiling pan so the drippings can drain off.  Next time, I will wrap the almost finished product around shrimp or scallops and finish cooking  on the grill!

I have been using this recipe since 1989 when I worked for a caterer, it's always a hit.  (I do omit the cinnamon). It is a must try if you're looking for something new to bring to a party.  We called it "Candied Bacon" at the Moose's Belly.  Enjoy!

I've made these several times now, and have tweaked a few things to make it easier for me.  I begin by using regular cut bacon, not thick, and I cut the slab in half so I get more appetizers out of each lb of bacon.  I let it come almost to room temp; I've found this makes it easier to twist.  Then I put my brown sugar mix (I only use 1C brown sugar, 1 tsp Allspice, and the 1/4 tsp Cayenne) in an oblong container, long enough for the bacon slices to make coating easier.  I use the same temp and time in the oven, and they come out perfect every time!

I just made these for my in-laws, who loved them, and they've become my husband's favorite hunting snack!

This was outstanding!  I made a mistake and put 1/2 tsp. cayenne instead of 1/4 tsp..  I was so worried that it would be too spicy but it wasn't.  I did not twist mine.  Simply because I overlooked that part of the directions.  We loved them.

I really want to like these, but I guess candied bacon is just too much for us.  Neither bf or I are huge fans, and I don't really taste any of the other spices.  All I really taste is the sugar.  I'd probably like it without the sugar though.  Big points for the baking method--I don't cook bacon much, and I'd forgotten how much grease there is in bacon.  Even after taking the alum foil out of the pan and throwing it away, I still had to wipe down the pan from all of the grease.  However, much less messy and easier to clean up than on the stovetop.  My bacon is fresh from the farm (literally--bf's parents gave us some from their butchering) and it was thicker, so it was a bit hard to twist, but I managed a few.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll try it again without the sugar.  Lesson learned that we don't like that combo!

Quite tasty.  Didn't have mustard in spice form, so I used dijon mustard instead.  It made sort of a paste which I crumbled over the bacon and pressed it into the bacon.  This worked very well.

Wow. Made these for a party at work. A huge hit! Suggestions: 1. Spray the foil and rack with Pam. 2. If you're making more than one batch, either have a second pan all prepared or put a new piece of foil on the pan. Otherwise the sugar on the bottom of pan starts scorching and imparts a burned flavor to the bacon. 3. If you're making these for a crowd, cut the baked twists in half with scissors. Definitely a keeper!

OMG so good!  I thought I had burnt them cause they were a little dark but they tasted great!  I loved the spice/sweetness of these and it made them unique and tasty!  Be careful cause in the oven when I touched them they still didn't feel crisp but they were dark so I took them out and after sitting a minute they crisp up.  So don't over do them!  Delicious and perfect!

I made this at camp for our pancake breakfast. I brought my broiler pan from home,put foil in the bottom and sprayed the grate first.At first they didnt seem to cook but once they started to carmelize they cooked real fast.I only made 1 # andshould have made more.Half of it was gone before I even put it on the table.Next time I will add  more cayenne personal preference.And I put the mixture in a ziplock and coated the bacon that way. Many people asked me for the recipe.

So good, it's bad! I think I'll halve the recipe next time and only make 1/2 pound. These are almost irresistible. Good cold too. Great on salads. Great "garnish" on veggies (broken up) or even London broil. Lip smackin' good!

Delicious!  This was a fun activity for the kids to make with me.  Not the healthiest snack but for a special occasion - they are perfect.  Have no worries about the spice level as they have little to no heat.  I would up the cayenne significantly next time. Definitely a whole teaspoon for our taste level.  I suggest covering your cookie sheet with the heavy duty, wide foil for easier clean up. The cooking time for my convection oven was too short for crispy bacon.  Took every bit of 45 minutes not 30.  They crisp up as they cool.  So good!

Umm, WOW. I made this for Christmas brunch and it went super fast. I always make sugared bacon, but this spiced recipe was a great treat. Since then, I've also made this with sriracha instead of cayenne which turns out even better. And if you're a spice fan,you can up the cayenne is this quite a bit.

I did a double batch, because I thought that it sounded great. 1st taste I thought that it was a  waste of good bacon. Then somewhere on about my 4th slice. I realized these suckers are addictive! I think that I could eat them all, and be happy.

These should be called Holiday Bacon Twists. These were so delicious and they reminded me of the holiday ham with the flavors. Very good but too decadent for everyday, these are probably best for a fancy holiday meal or a party appetizer. Thanks, I enjoyed every bite!!!

This recipe just didn't work out for me very well. My husband loves bacon, so I thought this would be a great treat for him. They were easy enough to put together and get in the oven, but it seemed like they just couldn't cook right. I didn't want to take them out until they could hold their shape, but by the time that got close to happening, they were mostly burnt. They weren't terrible, but they didn't live up to the other reviews I had read. I might just have to head up to that Inn in Atchison to taste their version.

I gave this 3 stars because I haven't tried this yet but I plan to make it for Sibling Friday this weekend.  It sounds great and something different for an appetizer nite with my sisters & brother!  I have do have one question....What the heck is in the first picture of this recipe .....it sure doesn't look like bacon to me; unless the black blob in the middle is supposed to be the bacon?  I would take this picture down as it does not seem correct to me and gives a bad impression of the results, if you don't check out all the rest of the photos!!

My son was helping me make mother
s Day brunch this morning. I made 3 AR recipes. crustless spinach quiche, Mom's Zucchiny Bread(muffins) and this recipe. I went to sit and take a break and son was watching the oven. He said the bacon still looked limp so i said turn it up a lil and 10 min..LOL..that poor petrified bacon. I did get to taste a piece that wasn't too well done. It tasted awesome..so I know this deserves 5 stars. Next time I will replace the pic of the burnt bacon next time I make this..and there will be a next time.

FANTASTIC!  Everyone loved it! Needs double the spices to make a difference - otherwise it's just sweet bacon (tho there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, either).

Had some candied bacon at a Christmas party and just had to have some for New Years. I used thick cut bacon and they came out perfect. My youngest who doesn't like to try new things just loved them. My teen daughter suggested we drizzle them with dark chocolate next time. We will be making them again.

Following the recipe is hard for me....but I did it anyway with this bacon. The end result was...meh.  I made this bacon for Christmas morning and although hubs and I enjoyed it, most everyone else left it on their plate. :(

Wonderful!  I omitted the cinnamon because I wanted a more savory taste.  I do not like nutmeg so I omitted it as well.  I only had a tablespoon of dry mustard powder on hand and used all of it.  I doubled the cayenne pepper, and it was not overly spicy.  I made a lot of alterations based on what I had in the pantry.  My guests loved it!

This is SO good.  I haven't used it as appetizers yet, but do use it often in salads and everyone comments about it. "What is that YUMMY extra crunch in the salad?"

Like the spices.  Takes much longer to crisp up.  If I chose to make it again I would not twist...you lose too much of the spices.

Tried this this morning with my 3 man-cubs and it was an instant hit; made it exactly as directed and the only thing I might change next time is reduce the amount of brown sugar (I had a ton of it left over) one of the nice things with this is that the boys didn't get to it right away and even cold they loved it  This is going in my frequent rotation

This looked like a great recipe and it did not disappoint.  I recruited my 14 year old son, who does not like to cook, into making these.  They were easy and tasted great!  My son liked them them enough to state that he plans to make them again!  We had them at a party and they were a hit!  He made them following the recipe exactly.  We might want to spice them up just a bit next time with a bit more pepper - and I don't really care for overly spicy food.

Followed the recipe exactly the first time.  I over coated the bacon and it was too sweet but the second time I toned it down and they turned out great!

Thanks for the heads up on lining the pan with foil, saved me a lot of clean up!

This has been a Christmas morning tradition in our home for a long time...but the kids beg me to make it more often!  Everyone raves over this and fights over the last piece.  Make plenty and go ahead and indulge every once-in-a-while!  This bacon is outstandingly delicious!!!!  :-)

This is very tasty. Can be used as an appetizer more than breakfast since it is sweet. Too many flavors going on as breakfast.

This was a really successful dish at our family Christmas potluck.  It was gone before dinner was even served.  And, I did 2 lbs of bacon.   Definitely worth trying and I will be making this over and over again.  Everyone raved about it.   Thank you for posting this awesome treat.  :)

This recipe is incredible!  I cut the recipe in half since it was just for my husband and I, and I'm glad I did or we would have eaten the whole pound of bacon in one sitting!  This recipe is a definite keeper, great texture, great taste, and best of all, very easy!

Wow - I made these for my 'goodie' day on Friday and what a hit they were!  I had people in my office all morning raving about the flavor!  Next time I may try them on the barbeque grill to cut down on the mess though (my broiler pan looks like it needed to be thrown away).  EXCELLENT recipe - thanks SO very much!

I just made these, they were a bit thick so 30 minutes wasn't quite enough, however I left them in a bit TOO long. they tasted OK, so I'm sure had I not messed up the timing they'd be delicious! They were also very ugly, I was the only one who ate them.

This is fantastic just as is. I love Bhut Jolokia so I used that instead of cayenne....Yumm. Definately line your pan, or you may have to toss them out. It bakes on pretty solid.

Upped the cinnamon a bit after reading the Carmelized bacon twists recipe, and reduced the dry mustard, but maybe  more importantly used the trick I read about putting water in the bottom of the pan to ease cleaning.  Both bacon and cleaning were 5 stars.

Will make again. I undercooked it by 3 minutes, right when the bacon started to smoke. Has a nice kick to it. It's a keeper!

The bacon works better on on a sheet pan lined with heavy foil topped with a sprayed mesh rack( on both sides).  I put the rack in my dishwasher door so as to keep from spraying the kitchen.  If the bacon is plain I pour the drippings from the foil into a freezer safe container and us as I want.

These are delicious! Made them for my Bible study group. Several people asked for the recipe. I referred them to allrecipes.com and shared my substitutions. After reading reviews, I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. Didn't have dry mustard powder or cayenne pepper so I used 1/2 rounded tsp of cumin. Fantastic! (Also good with 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp paprika which I used in my first trial batch. My 6 year old grandson gave them a thumbs up!)

This is amazingly good! 30 minutes baking time was too long and I should have watched it more closely. some pieces burned, but it got eaten any way.

I would (and I am!!) making this recipe again! It was a huge success at a recent cocktail party and went perfect with craft beers. 
The bacon was delicious, sweet and spicy. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of baking about 10 minutes longer to get it crispy.

This bacon was tasty, but it took forever to cook (over 40 minutes in my high-altitude area), and the bacon was STILL floppy instead of crispy. Yes, it was safely cooked-through, but I really hate floppy bacon. It may have been the type of bacon I used, to be fair...(Bar S Thin Bacon). As I said, the taste is delicious but for me it was too much trouble for too little reward. Sorry

We tweeked this to a dish we had on vacation: 1.25 c brown sugar, 2 T dry mustard, 1 t red pepper, 1 tsp paprika.  Remaining mix after dipping  the bacon was toppedon the baking as well as a light sprinkle of paprika.
Awesome treat with a glass of red wine and Swiss cheese.

Used thick bacon and the recommended changes of a ziploc bag and pumpkin pie spice. Left the bacon flat. Served it at room temperature. Could have been spicier, but overall a big hit.

I have been microwaving bacon for years; flat on a plate sprinkled well with (white) sugar and black pepper.

This was a huge hit. A teen at a recent party said, "Whoever made that bacon is a genius." After I claimed credit, he gave me not one but two hugs! The only extra tips I can offer is to twist it more than you think you need to because it can become untwisted a bit as it cooks; maybe use toothpicks to keep them in place. You can retwist when you remove from the oven, but they are HOT!

This sounded great, but it ended up a blackened mess.  The sugar burned before the bacon cooked, so it looked very unappetizing. The taste wasn't bad, but it was a ton of work and mess for something not worth it.

I had an appetizer at a community function that sounds like this recipe, however, each was wrapped around a thin it Italian breadstick..easy to hold. Thanks for the recipe for the coating, and the tip on baking on a cooling rack.  Will try this with TURKEY BACON for a healthier alternative.  wish me luck!

We really enjoyed!!!  I did put just a dash of cayenne because some of us don't like too much spice.  Surprisingly all that mustard powder wasn't at all nippy.

This was a big hit at a recent office food day. I doubled up on the cayenne pepper for some extra kick and baked a little longer to be crispier. Heated up fairly well for the next morning.
