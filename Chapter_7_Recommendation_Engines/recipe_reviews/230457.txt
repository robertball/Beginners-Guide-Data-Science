ok, so i'm the first to make/ rate it! :) made them Monday for Christmas, next day there weren't any more left! although i'll admit that the first time i only made half of the recipe because i had no idea what to expect! :) and it's amazing! it's so easy to make (i followed the recipe exactly) and the result is such a delicate and melt-in-your-mouth almond goodness, you really have to try them! i don't know if they're really cookies, i'll go more for pastries, but i've put them with the cookies anyway. and i'll try the same dough with different fillings, too - i guess something fruity would work really well, adding a little zing to the flakiness of the pastry. oh, and i used meringue powder instead of the egg white, and i also decorated them with some green and red cookie icing (ready made from wilton), and they were the absolute hit of the cookie platters (and i really wasn't expecting this, there were others a lot more interesting, but...). so go on, try them, they're good! one thing: you might want to cut the slits not too deep, because the marzipan will ooze out and dry out and you'll have to discard that. so thank you Carol for the recipe, it's one of our staples from now on!

I made this recipe for a close German friend. She was very pleased and raved about the recipe stating that her mother used to make a similar recipe. It was very, very good.
