I wanted to rate this with 5 stars. It is a very good recipe, however, the one thing I would caution against is the use of the beer can. Due to many countries importing and exporting metals, and not knowing if lead could exist in the can, I would like to suggest using a container, which is oven safe for the beer. The labeling on the can could also carry toxins in the paint used to decorate or advertise. I have found small oven safe bowls for this purpose, and they do come in handy for other uses as well.

AWESOME!!!!! This is the best chicken ever! You can get the stand for a couple of bucks at the local grocery. I was in a hurry this time and just cooked on a broiler pan in the oven and cooked veggies separately. Came out great. This is a huge hit every time I make it. With the left overs, I take the carcass and boil. Remove bones etc.. it makes a great soup with some added noodles and seasoning. This last time I froze the soup and when the weather cools down it will be an easy dinner to thaw and add some simple dumplings for a hearty Chicken and Dumplings dinner. This is a true winner and can easily be a 2 in 1 meal.

I roast a lot of chicken using a "stand-up" chicken rack (round pan with two metal arches you impale the chicken on). But this is the very best-tasting. While I tried using orange juice instead of oranges, it didn't really work. But the rest of the seasoning was amazing...especially if you use fresh rosemary with the onion slices. I also used poultry seasoning rubbed onto the greased chicken. The smell in the house drove us crazy, it was so good. I will definitely be using this recipe almost weekly.

This recipe is delicious.  I have used it many times.  I use the most awesome vertical chicken roaster from QVC! It has a place to put the beer, juice, wine, etc. in the center and then you can place the veggies all around. You don't have to worry about the chicken falling over. It can be used in the oven, bbq grill, etc. It also has many other uses.  I have three of them.  If you use this recipe a lot, you would love this item.  Thanks for sharing your recipe....it makes me hungry!

Delicious, and so easy! BUT I have one caution. It is NOT safe to use beer cans for cooking. The coloring used on the label is not food grade, and the aluminum can and its plastic interior coating can give off toxic fumes when heated to cooking temperature. There are several reasonably priced "beer can" cookers available.. I use one called the "Poultry Pal". Be safe!

This is good. If you really want to jazz it up buy yourself a bottle of "Herbs de Provence". It is made up of all the herbs the French grow and use. It has rosemary, thyme,summer savory, lavender, marjoram, basil, sage and oregano mixed together in one jar. It is much cheaper to buy it already made up than to make it your self. You can find a million used for herbs de provence. It is killer on lamb with lots of garlic!

I always make my chicken like this only w/o the beer.  I put seasoned ckn broth  in the can.  I do have 2 tips to share. I have a rack for my ckn [walmart $5]. But sometimes I make more than one ckn & I use a 24oz can to avoid the can tipping over and I also place a wad of foil or a small potato over the neck of the ckn to keep the meat nice  & moist.  Enjoy!!  P.S.  That's a 16 oz can not 24 oz.

I made a variation of this recipe last weekend that was just phenomenal.  I used Blue Moon's summer beer, Honey Moon and basted the chicken with butter every 45 minutes or so.  A must try before the summer is out!

This was sooo good.  The chicken was moist and tender and the potatoes had a faint hint of rosemary.  I used russet potatoes as that was all I had.  I also basted the chicken with fresh squeezed orange juice.  When the chicken was done I had a lot of juice in the pan so I added it to chicken stock and mixed in corn starch for a wonderful gravy.  My brother came over later and made a chicken and potato sandwich with havarti cheese and said it was the best sandwich he'd had in years.

Do not do this without the chicken rack.  Mine toppled over on the beer can.  Complete disaster in my oven.  It was still good lying down, but not what I had worked for.

If you are worried about the effects of aluminium and or the paint, why not just use a narrow recycled glass jar, like a tall olive jar. Nothing to worry with that, it doesnt mind the heat..

I didn't add vegetables to mine; I think it may just be our family but this was just ok for us.. We never really get enough flavor with roasted chicken and I always feel a bit let down after all the work that goes in them.   I followed the recipe exactly and it was difficult to get the slipery chicken on top of the beer can without the oranges falling out.  I think I will invest in a roasting rack that allows you to put the beer can in the middle.  Maybe I need to marinade my whole chickens before baking... I don't know!  I can say it was moist!

Great recipe, and so moist!  I just wanted to add one suggestion.  I mixed my seasonings with a little bit of olive oil in a bowl and painted the whole chicken with a bbq brush.  Much easier than trying to sprinkle all over a standing up chicken.  I actually used dried rosemary, salt and garlic, but it was terrific.  I'll start making this all the time, because you can change up the spices to suit your taste.  Maybe even add some carrots to the broth.

To the cook that was asking what to do with half of the beer:  You pour out half or drink half so the can is only half full.  You do not pour it into the pan.

There is NEVER enough of this roasted chicken - I always do 2 at once - just for the valuable leftovers! Yum! Sometimes I do a sweet/hot rub. I don't usually make a sauce/gravy or the roasted vegetable - actually I never thought of it - but it's on my radar now.

Delish!!!! Really juicy and tasty.  I used a spice rub for the skin and put in my BBQ.  Quick and easy to prepare.  Also used more beer in the pan instead of broth, I added  carrots with the potatoes.  will make again with a bigger chicken!! Also went to bed bath and beyond to get the beer can chicken holder, I suggest you invest in one it you want to make this recipe.

Loved this recipe because it was a great starter recipe.  I have two bits of advice.  First, definitely invest in a stand but it does not have to be expensive.  If you are worried about the harsh chemicals on the can that can be transfered to your chicken from the can's decorative labeling, merely cover the can with foil paper.

My second suggestion, place the stand, beer, chicken, and taters in an oven safe skillet (not a baking pan). That way you can use the same cooking vessel to continue cooking your vegetables or finish your gravy.

I followed the recipe with one exception, I used a lemon instead of an orange.  Fantastic! To me, I really liked the potatoes, but they taste exactly like the chicken.  I'd rather make them seperatly with a different seasoning, so the whole plate doesn't taste the same.  They were good, just the same.

This was excellent and so easy to do. We used a flavored beer to bring in more flavor. The chicken was perfect. We didn't use cooking bring though, we used olive oil and spices on the outside which held the moisture perfectly.

This was great! First time trying this cooking method. It's a little trying, because it definitely requires two people, but the chicken was soooo moist I could hardly believe it! I also used a well-greased recycled tall olive jar instead of the beer can because I'm wary of the paint and the metals in the can. Presto! I doubled the rosemary and the oranges under the skin, and roasted it with onions, carrots, sweet potatoes and garlic. Yum!

Fabulous chicken!  I agree with others that a beer can is not the best thing to use - there are many ways to prop up a chicken - one is to set it up on the center of your bundt pan and put the pan in a roasting pan.  Tehn you can pour your liquids and vegetables into the bundt pan and add the drippings from inside the chicken to the liquid after it's done.  Since I didn't need a beer can, I used some wine instead. I had fresh rosemarym but I don't like orange with chicken so I used a barbecue chicken rub to flavor it up a bit.  So I ended up with a different recipe, but it was Debbie's that got me going, and it came out marvellous.  Thanks, Debbie.

Absolutely tasty chicken, the orange and rosemary permeates the meat. Chicken stock and beer in the bottom of the pan to cook the potatoes. Fantastic, juicy, tasty chicken. I wrapped the beer can in aluminium foil. Loved it.

Very Tasty - We are not usually rosemary fans but really good when used in moderation.  Followed the recipe to the T except for not wasting beer by  pouring 1/2 of the beer out but simple poured it into me ...Great recipe Thx Debbie

When taking the chicken out of the oven, be VERY careful not to let the chicken tip over: Huge mess! I don't know why the one "expert cook" was so harsh. I find chicken done this way very moist and tasty. I bought my "ChickCAN Rack" at Home Depot. ($2.98) Good investment!

I've roasted chicken this way many times, experimenting with different seasonings each time.  You can use whatever you have on hand - a can of beer, diet Coke,  ginger ale - it doesn't seem to make a detectable difference in taste - it's the steam that the liquid in the can creates that matters I think.  I also stuff the neck cavity with an onion or potato - something to keep the steam inside the chicken while it's cooking. This is a really good method for roasting a very moist and delicious chicken!

Amazing Results every time!  I have also cooked on the Barbecue as well.  I add red potatoes, green and red peppers, celery and baby carrots around the chicken.

good! worth making again. I didn't have fresh rosemary, but tucked in dried rosemary, and still came away with good results. otherwise followed as stated. 1 1/2 hrs was just perfect timing for me! might squeeze more orange onto chicken next time- kind of missed that flavor.

AWESOME!!! 10 minutes into the oven, the aroma in the house was driving u crazy!!! Made it last night and can't wait for dinner tonight to eat the leftovers. I didn't make any major variations, only used one sour orange instead and dropped a couple of cloves inside the beer. YUMMY!

I try to have something nontraditional to go along with the traditional at our Christmas dinner, and this was it this year. As the oven was already in use I cooked on the grill with indirect heat. I did get a stand for the chicken stood it on a roasting pan. Was a big hit. Thanks for sharing

I have used the orange slices & rosemary, and have roasted the chicken with just beer & spice rub.  It turns out juicy and tasty either way.  A great way to cook a chicken...not to mention quite a presentation when it comes out of the oven!

This came out perfectly!  The only change i made was substituting broth with more beer because i had extra i wanted to be rid of.  I made a gravy with the extra beer and juices from the chicken that were in the pan by simmering it and whisking in flour to thicken it.  

My family loved this and we barely even had any leftovers.  What we did have were gone in a day.  I looj forward to making this again, its now my favorite way of roasting chicken in the oven.

Added a dry rub mixed with lemon & olive oil. Marinated for 2 hours. In beer, added 3 large cloves garlic with small slices in them. Also added 3 sprigs fresh rosemary. USE less stock. Makes it soupy. Last 1/2 hr. increased temp to 400 degrees

So easy and delicious! I recommend adding more potatoes, they were the best potatoes I've had. I make this on a regular basis now, it's cheap, easy, and so good! The only downside is that it's hard to wait for the chicken to be done, it smells so good all through the house.

The flavor was good, but the beer can tipped over in the oven - splattery mess and soggy chicken on one side. Probably won't bother again -- lots of other less tricky-balancing-act recipes for chicken.  Wonder if this didn't work better back when beer cans were sturdier?

Very moist and flavorful. Mine didn't turn out as crispy on the outside as I'd hoped. I have a large family so I bought a larger chicken and the beer can couldn't quite support it in an upright position. It still tasted great though.

Absolutely amazing chicken. Meltingly moist meat, crisp skin and easy to prepare.  I'll never make a chicken another way. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I only had bottles of beer so I poured it into a small coffee mug & put the chicken over that.

OH MY GOD!!! Best chicken I've ever had! All I did different was I added carrots and celery to the dish, and for the rub I had a package of 'beer butt chicken seasoning' from Kroger that was 99 cents. I used Boddington's beer, the large can.

Awesome roasted chicken! Very easy way to make a new family favorite! I had to go to work at 6pm and when I got home, it was GONE! My husband and two daughters didn't leave me a scrap. Good thing I tasted it before leaving. It was yummy, and I really had my hopes up for having a snack, guess I'll have to do it again soon. I am definitely getting one of those racks, that is the only way to make this any easier. Anything that my family devours like that has to get a 5. Next time, though, I'll roast the potatoes separately, we like them a bit less soggy. I threw in some baby carrots also and they were tasty cooked in the stock and onions.(I always use stock, not broth, for the deeper flavor.) thanks so much for this one, it will be a regular with us!

This is too DIE FOR!!  The only change I made was to substitute lemon pepper (Mrs. Dash) for the seasoned salt.  I used kosher salt and 1/4 tsp. coarse ground pepper.  I used a dark boch beer.  MMMMM good!  Finger lickin good!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Beer can chicken does sound more appetizing! LOL!
I do this on indirect heat on the BBQ and rotate the chicken every 15 minutes, during a one hour period and the last 10 minutes or so, over the direct heat before checking the temp. Normally no more than 1 hr 15 minutes--it's always delicious. You can also use wine or orange juice in the can or a combo of both.

Great recipe, but you could use a cheaper and not as good a beer as the Budweiser pictured in the photo..  I would suggest another beer that is not the quality of a Bud.  You can even use a soft drink which would not waste any beer.

Beer can fell down while I was cooking the chicken and spilled the beer.  Decided to just cook the chicken in the beer and chicken stock in the bakin dish.  Still turned out fantastic, chicken is very juicy and tender.

My first attempt at beer can chicken - used beer, followed recipe exactly.  Took about 2 hours to cook through - served up beautifully and was delicious!  The citris flavor was light and just right, love the rosemary flavor as well!  Not something I'd make every weekend but definitely would do again!

I love this recipe and am making it right now.  However I didn't know there were racks for holding the chicken/beer.  I haven't had any problems without it but I am going to look for one to be safe.

Very good chicken! Very juicy. I added carrots and onion quarters to the bottom of the pan with the red potatoes and they all turned out well. After the chicken was picked and the veggies were taken out of the broth I put the carcass and broth into a crock pot with water to make fanstastic chicken stock for another recipe!

Great, easy recipe that makes you look like you cook like a pro. I've made it as written several times.  The only thing I add is my seasonings which include poultry seasoning, sazon, sea salt and pepper.  So good!!

This dish was very easy and went over well with my husband...until the chicken fell over and the left over beer in the can got into all the potatoes and onions.  Make sure the chicken is secured and won't fall over!!  Other than that single mishap, it was great.

We only had three for Thanksgiving so I made this instead of turkey, since my turkey recipe is also orange/rosemary/onion. We liked it better than turkey! Since I was making mashed potatoes, I left the potatoes out and just put onions in the pan and a couple of orange chunks, then strained off the pan juices to make gravy.

Made this to spec except I was out of chicken broth so I used beef broth. It didn't make one bit of difference from what I can tell and the chicken was one of the best I had ever made! Super crispy outside, very moist inside and fresh herbs really make a difference. Love it and will make it a fall/winter staple. Thanks!

FYI----- They also sell a turkey vertical roaster.
We call it Chicken on a Stick.  Would be hard to get a beer can in that type.

This was delicious!   I think the preparation of the chicken was key... and believe it would be just as good without the beer roasted in a cooking bag.

I have never left a review before but for this I had to! This is truly the best chicken I have ever made. Crisp on the outside, juicy inside. Hint of orange and rosemary to boot. What little was left over the next day was made into sandwiches which were fabulous. This recipe will be a mainstay in my household.

This recipe sounds delicious and I intend to try it, but after reading the reviews I would like to comment that you do not need a rack.  You just position the legs to make a tripod effect.  I do my beer can chicken using a rub on the BBQ and It takes only 1 hour and 15 minutes and is delicious.

This was great!  The fresh rosemary and the oranges gave the chicken such a great flavor.  After I carved the bird I juiced some of the orange and chicken broth from the pan on top before serving and loved it.

This was really fabulous!  I roast quite a bit of chicken, and my husband said that this was the best I've ever made.  The only change I made was to use Poultry Magic instead of seasoned salt.  Thanks for such a great recipes...definitely will make over and over again.

This was so delicious!  I put as much orange, onion and rosemary as I could fit under the skin and up the cavity.  And I used a high end IPA (Apocalypse IPA in the green can.)  My husband said it was the best chicken I'd ever made :-)

Instead of just using a beer can, I purchased a proper stand for the chicken so that there is no chance of it falling over . They are available at most stores that sell barbecue equipment.
I also substituted a nice white wine for the beer and cooked it on the barbecue. What's great is that the white wine and herbs are infused into the chicken and the fat from the chicken falls into the tray that holds the can, so the chicken is very tasty and not so fatty.
This is a great recipe and I would encourage changing things around, using different herbs, fruit and liquids to satisfy your own tastes. I will definitely do this again.

I thought this was delicious.  So tender.  I did not use the can to prop the chicken.  I put the beer in a small metal bowl and propped the chicken up on it with some aluminum foil in a cast iron skillet - it worked just fine.  Next time I will peel the orange and put the peel under the skin to create a more intense orange flavor.  I did not add the potatoes and instead paired it with Roasted Butternut Orange Risotto found on this site.  What an amazing meal.

I love this recipe and have used it for many years! One of the things I do differently is I use 1/2 a can of beer and supplement the other half of the can with BBQ sauce. After washing the chicken, I spray the skin with Pam cooking spray and then sprinkle a mesquite seasoning rub from Costco on it. The skin comes out crispy and very yummy. The mesquite rub is a fantastic compliment to the beer/BBQ mix. I highly recommend buying the stand for the can so it doesn't fall over. I used a small baking dish that just fits the stand but is relatively tall, so that juices don't leak and make a mess in the over. Lining the baking dish with foil makes clean up easier as well.

The engineering of this was a disaster! The chicken wouldn't stand up with the beer inside, it kept tipping over. And even when it did stay up, the orange slices, rosemary, and onion slipped out from under the skin. And what's the point of seasoning the outside of the chicken then pouring the broth over it??

I tried this recipe and it was good but I improved on the recipe a little. One thing I think it needed was a good brine before cooking. Also I find the insertions beneath the breast to be unnecessary if the cavity is properly closed. Use butchers twine to hold the wings behind the bird to prevent burning. I also start the oven at 500F on broil to quickly sear the birds skin shut then reduce the heat to 350 until thoroughly cooked.

I put this chicken together as listed, but changed the cooking method.  We were having a lot of people for dinner, so I made one standing beer butt chicken and a pan full of “parts” chicken with all the listed ingredients.  We put in a smoker for 5 hours and finished it on the gas grill to achieve the nice browning effect.  I liked the very hint taste that the orange provided in this chicken.  It was so tender and full of flavor.  This will be a good recipe to make in the winter when it is too cold to smoke or grill.  The potatoes had so many flavors with this cooking method. I served this with ‘Grilled Zucchini II’ from AR.  Nice recipe Debbie, thank you for sharing.

Potatoes were AMAZING!  Chicken was pretty bland.

I've made this several times and it's always excellent.  I make this when I have company. Two or three of these on the table? WOW!!!!  Makes a beautiful presentation.

It was good, skin was awesome, was not dry at all.   I really would love suggestions as how to make gravy from left over juice.  Also did anyone else experience raw potatoes.  My chicken was done at 180 but potatoes where still raw and had to remove chicken and continue to cook.  I sliced them, maybe I have to slice them real thin?  Thank you great recipe.

This was fantastic! I did mine in a shallow pan on the grill. The chicken is soo moist and has a wonderful flavor. Can't wait for sandwiches tomorrow.

Delicious!! To make life a little easier, I bought the beer can chicken stand from my local BBQ shop - it helps keep everything all upright.

Excellent recipe! What a perfect and simple way to do a chicken. BTW, who is "Beer Butt Rosemary" and why does she put up with a moniker like that??

This was the best chicken I have ever eaten!! The meat was so juicy and tender. My fiance and 18 month old couldn't get enough. Thanks for the recipe, Debbie.

I don't know maybe I did something wrong, but I don't think so because I followed this recipe exactly.  It did come out moist and golden but it was very bland.  My mother-in-law ate it so that was embarrassing.
