This was good but not what I had expected.  Im not into "sweet cooking" the cake did not rise it was flat but it did have an ok flavor.

This was my first try at making pound cake and it was very good! I didn't have pecans though, so I used walnuts. It wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be, so I was very pleased. It had a great flavor!

This cake is a waste of pecans.  The pecans were on top not in the cake and the cake was dense and  tasted too much of eggs. Maybe some baking powder would help.

I omitted the butter flavored extract, only because I didn't have any.  Nevertheless, this cake was outstanding.  I will definitely make this again. After tasting it, my friend's husband asked me to make him one. This recipe is a keeper!
