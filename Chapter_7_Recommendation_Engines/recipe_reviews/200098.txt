This would be great for a slumber party for kids.  It's quick to prepare, and I think they're ingred. kids love.  ....SUGAR! lol  However, in our own home ...our KIDS are not accustomed to something so sweet, so did not like it.  Maybe trying a poptart w/o frosting, using low-fat vanilla ice cream, and doing away with whipped cream would help.  ...even adding sprinkles as shown in the picture.  I also like my poptarts microwaved a tad over toasted, so it's more like an ice cream sandwich instead of crunchy.  Brown sugar poptarts with vanilla is a good combination idea too.  Still doesn't replace a good ol' chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich!  Yummmmmm.......

We thought these were really good! I used chocolate vanilla cream Pop Tarts and Strawberry ice cream. I warmed the Pop Tarts first which melted the ice cream just enough. You might want to try it. It was delish!
