Really good.  I did modify the cooking method though.  I sauted 2 cups of dry orzo in a little butter then added 2 1/2 cups water and 1/2 cup white wine.  I totally forgot to add the chicken bouillon.  I brought it to a boil then reduced it to a simmer and cooked for about 8 - 10 minutes until the orzo was done.  This way, all the liquid was absorbed and I didn't need to drain it.  I was hoping to get more of the wine flavor this way.  Then I stirred in more like 1/2 cup of parmesan and then added the roasted veggies.

This is an excellent recipe. I used zucchini, squash, and onions for the vegetables. I followed the recipe otherwise but just cut it down in size. Just keep in mind that an entire box of orzo will feed an army. I used one cup of dry orzo and it made a lot. This is great and I will be making this again in the near future.

This is good. It's a little bland, so plan on being liberal with salt and pepper - and adding more cheese. The amount of water for the pasta isn't specified, but would be helpful since there are measured ingredients flavoring it. I added roasted red peppers because they seemed to belong in this. We enjoyed it, thanks!

I made this to bring to a BBQ and it turned out great! I used two zucchini and 2 squash instead of just one each to balance how much asparagus and mushrooms there were, and increased the amount of oil to compensate, but otherwise followed the recipe and got rave reviews! I'll definitely make this again.

Thanks to all for the great reviews and modification feedback! I too have made some changes since I first posted this recipe. What I like most about it is that it is extremely versatile...use whatever vegetables you like or what's in season, and pick your pasta and protein. I've made it vegetarian, with chicken and with shrimp. When I cook the pasta I either use a couple of bouillon cubes or stock (whatever I have on hand). And I agree that one package of orzo is WAY too much...you should use more like 1/2 a package for 4 servings. When roasting the vegetables I've started subbing the sugar for a T of balsamic vinegar. And last but not least...MORE CHEESE!

This was great! It was super easy to make and extremely yummy. I added a bit of Mozzerella to the pasta. Perfect!

This is a great base recipe.  I roasted pieces of eggplant, zucchini, asparagus and white mushrooms as well as one chicken breast cut into bite size pieces.  I tossed everything into some whole wheat penne pasta and added a handful of fresh basil leaves, crumbled feta cheese and squeezed lemon.  This recipe is definitely very versatile and healthy! Thanks!

Delicious!!!  I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it!  My guests each had 2 or more helpings!  The only thing that I changed was that I added about 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese instead of 2 Tablespoons and I seasoned it liberally with sea salt and pepper.  Otherwise, it is wonderful just as it is!

Awesome recipe sunnybird!  I did sub broccoli IPO aspargus and b/c some people complained about lack of seasoning; I added a pinch more sugar, 1 tsp onion/1 tsp garlic powder over the veggies.  Personally, I like orzo pasta touch but you could also serve these veggies alone without it for your side dish.  Great way to use up the garden's summer squash and zinni's! Thanks again!

This recipe really lends itself to changes based on what you have  on hand and individual preferences. I gave this 4 stars because I felt it needed more spices and the improved method of cooking the orzo thanks to reviewer SAHMCOOK (great idea). I have made it several ways.  My favorite follows.... I saut√©ed 2 c orzo in butter for a few minutes until the orzo was slightly toasted, then added 3 c chicken broth, brought to a boil, then reduced to a simmer.  No draining was needed and the flavor was great.  I also added the juice of two large lemons to the orzo mixture because I didn't have white wine.  This created a small amount of lemon flavored sauce.  I added 1 c. of fresh basil when I added the roasted veggies to the mix because we really like fresh basil.  For my veggies I roasted squash, zucchini, asparagus, onions and peppers (one bell, one jalepeno) because that's what I was harvesting from my garden.  I left the mushrooms out only because I didn't have any.  Again that is what is great about this recipe. Out of parmesan cheese, try feta or goat cheese. No garlic on hand, use balsamic vinegar as Michelle suggested in her review.  Need to turn it into an entre, add a cup of two of chicken.  Thanks Michelle for a tasty, fast, adaptable dish.

I didn't change a thing (except extra parm cheese) and it was delicious.  My boyfriend said how much he liked it a few times and I usually have to beat comments out of him:)

This is really good and a nice accompaniment to any grilled meat! It is very colorful and well presented. I browned 1 cup orzo in 2 T butter for a toastier flavor, added 14oz chicken broth, bring to boil, cover and reduce to simmer 15-20 minutes. So easy to combine everything at the end. Thank you, Michelle!

This is a fabulous recipe! I make this almost every week. It is a delicious way to serve vegetables. I drizzle balsamic vinegar over the veggies instead of using the olive oil/sugar mixture. Once the veggies are roasted, I mix them in with the cooked orzo pasta and add some fresh chopped basil for extra flavor! This goes well with a simple lemon chicken or even a cajun chicken (something with a little spice to compliment the mildness of this dish). This dish looks very "gourmet like" so this is a great recipe if you are making a dinner to impress!

I tried this because someone gave me zucchini, and because I like fresh asparagus, and because I'm always trying to find ways to get my picky kids to eat more vegetables.  I made it as an entree, so they HAD to eat it or fend for themselves.  They were all very surprised, and this recipe has become a staple in our menu rotations.  We often add grilled chicken breasts, either sliced and mixed in or whole on a bed of orzo and drizzled with chicken gravy.

The recipe as a standalone meal or an accompanying side dish was rather bland.  Fortunately it was not meant to be center stage, but to complement the main dish.  But an easy fix is to add more spices which I liberally took advantage of.  Served Zippy Summer Shrimp (also from AR) over the orzo to impart more flavor.  Turned out wonderful and it was a winning combo!  Thanks Michelle for the recipe.

This was very good; I only had zucchini and red onion so that's all I used, but it was still delicious! 
I tried cooking the veggies for a longer time at 350 degrees, because I had a chicken roasting at that temp, but the zucchini got mushy. Next time I'll follow directions for higher temp, or maybe wait and add zucchini later on. It does need some salt at the end, or lots of cheese. Will make again.

This was ok, but lacked in flavor. I think cooking in a smaller amount of liquid, and using broth instead of water, letting it cook until all of the liquid is absorbed, might make for a more satisfying dish.

I really like this recipe. I was concerned that there were far more vegetables than would be needed, but almost the opposite was true (16 oz. of orzo made a lot more than I thought when cooked). Next time, I will increase the herbs and vegetables.

Great! Made as written. It makes A LOT. Could use those veggies with 1/2 the amount of pasta if you wanted to. Will make again before my summer veggies are out of season!

Wonderful recipe, I did make a few changes. Sauted 2 cups of whole wheat orzo in 3tbsp of butter first then, added two 14 oz cans of chicken stock and 1/2 c of white wine- cooked 15 mins or until all liquid was absorbed. Also bulked up on veggies and used white truffle oil instead of olive oil-OMG, so good. Extra pepper, salt and parm too!

This recipe is delicious, with some modifications. If you really want 4 servings, don't cook a pound of orzo, maybe half that amount, and even then it will be a lot. Our protobellos were huge, so we chunked them. I roasted the veggies longer, more like 45 minutes, partly because my oven is on the slow side, and also because we like the caramelization that happens with longer cooking. Used veggie bouillon cubes so we could all eat this and added much more parmesan, maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup, as it goes so well with the rest of the ingredients. Everybody loved it. Thanks!

very good...a little time consuming cutting the veggies, but worth it...need to be careful to not over cook the veggies and the orzo rice is done when the rice is soft not when the liquid is all absorbed I also sauted the rice in butter first...added fresh parsley and crushed basil, very good, Scotty had seconds!

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  Everyone loved this dish.  Not everyone in our family loves all the veggies in this dish but I did not have one complaint.  The only issue i had was the proportion of rice to veggies but admitaly my squash and zucchini seemed a little small.  Just for good measure I think I will double the veggies next time.

Absolutely delicious.  Way too much orzo for 4, used 1 cup, added 1 can of black beans to make a main dish.

Loved it.  I made a huge batch of vegetables (2 trays) and roasted them for about 2 hours.  I used a good tablespoon of sugar to encourage carmelization.  Delicious and nutritious.

I threw something like this together a couple of weeks ago to go with grilled tilapia - did the veggies in a grill pan not the oven.  Wonderful smokey flavor.  Great suggestion of cooking the orzo with the boullion.  As a reminder to folks, - orzo is NOT RICE, IT'S PASTA.  If you try to cook it so the liquid absorbs, it will get gummy.

We loved this!  I used julienned carrots, zucchini, yellow squash and mushrooms. It was DELICIOUS. Don't skip the sugar, the hint of sweetness really makes this dish!

Where has this recipe been all my life?!  This has to be one of the most delicious recipes I have ever made.  It is so simple, yet the flavors are so complex.  I did two things differently (which I don't think changed the outcome), I skipped the wine, because I didn't have any and I roasted the cloves of garlic whole so they didn't burn.  When they were done, I chopped them up and added them to the veggies.  I didn't measure the parmesan, but just sprinkled it on. I can't wait to have the leftovers today.   This will defintely be made quite frequently in my house, especially in the summer with all the fresh veggies from the garden.

I have made this twice now: once exactly as stated in the recipe and once by varying the vegetables.  This is an easy, versatile summer recipe.    Be warned however that the quality and flavor of the recipe will directly depend on the quality of your vegetables and your wine selection.  If you don't use good quality ingredients you are going to have a bland dish.  Also, the appearance of the dish is greatly assisted if you ensure your veggies are dry roasted and don't allow them to sit in their own liquid.  I agree with others that the addition of peppers and and garden fresh basil definitely helps this recipe.

OMG!!! This was soooooo awesome! My hubs didn't care for the squash in this, but he happily picked around it. :) Although tasty as written, I immediately knew that this was in need of a few adjustments. An entire box of orzo would feed an army (my gosh...). Secondly, the amount of water for cooking the pasta is not specified. It would certainly have been helpful to advise how much water to use since there are measured ingredients flavoring it. To remedy these issues, I read both the recipe submitter and SAHMCOOK's reviews and adhered to their advice. As SAHMCOOK did, I too added 2 1/2 c. water / 1/2 c. wine (chardonnay) to my orzo, brought everything to a boil and then simmered on low for 10 minutes. I DID add all four bouillon cubes, however. This worked perfectly - I didn't have to drain anything and was able to lock in all of that GREAT flavor! I also followed recipe submitter Michelle's advice and added more cheese (1/2 cup's worth) and reduced the amount of orzo to 2 c. My final (personal) change was to omit the portobello mushrooms altogether (we hate 'em). With these changes, this was SUPER delicious and the perfect complement to serve alongside our grilled chipotle crusted pork tenderloin (KRAMNODROG)! Thanks SO much for sharing this great recipe with the AR community, Michelle! My hubs and I LOVED it. :-)

Great recipe. I grilled the veggies instead of roasting and used Better Than Boullion instead of cubes to cut down on the salt, but other than the cooking method for the veggies, I made the recipe as is. Very tasty! Easy to change the veggies to your own liking. Thanks for sharing, Michelle.

Great recipe that can be adapted to what veggies you have on hand.  I used a combination of zucchini, yellow squash, peppers and onions.  I decreased the amount of orzo and used 2 cups of orzo to 4 cups of chicken broth.  It definitely needed more cheese to up the flavor quotient but that's my personal taste.

A wonderful, earthy, dish that accommodates the needs of the moment! Sweet red pepper supplanted asparagus tonight and added color and brightness. Parmesana or Pecorino will add a nice accent and some texture.
Would like to pare down the oil a bit and try fresh basil or minced garlic at the end!

Definately an open palette!

Made this per directions, and it was good, but it makes a TON! Fed our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 hungry pre-teens) three meals. I added shredded chicken to it the first night to make it a meal in itself.

I thought this was fabulous!  I have never stirred wine into my pasta water!  I'm a little confused on the last reviewer.  First of all this is a pasta not a rice and will not soak up all the liquid, and after adding the boullion cube it calls for to the pasta waster it does turn into a broth.  The flavor really came through and it was delicious!  So much flavor!  Thanks!

This is my first time making Orzo, but did half the amount since only three of us eating. We roasted  all our veggies on the charcoal grill over direct heat which really added a great smoky flavor, and I did marinate my veggies for about 30 minutes in some light bottled Italian dressing. What a great side dish this was, and we will be doing this one again and again...Thanks Michelle for posting.

Very nice! Made as written, except used white mushrooms (that's what I had), and more of most of the veggies than called for. I only had like a little less than 3/4 of a box of orzo, so I just used that and that was more than enough. IMO, this needs quite a bit more salt and pepper than you would think...and definately more parmesan cheese. I would definately make this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I tried another users suggestion of cooking the orzo with with just enough water and wine so the pasta would absorb the liquid, but it turned gummy.  The flavor was still amazing so I will definitely make again, but this time I will boil the pasta as the recipe indicates so it is cooked perfectly!

Really, REALLY wonderful! I added a red pepper that I needed to use up too. Just incredible. This feeds waaaaay more than 4 tho. Maybe 6-8 as a main dish or 10-12 as a side dish. Makes a ton, which is fine by us....leftovers:)

Very good, colorful and versatile recipe.  I loved the wine.  Added some fresh basil, tomatoes, fresh mozzerella and cilantro because I had it.  Could use a bit more kick.  Will keep playing with it.

This is so fantastic. I can't wait to make it again!

This is what I did: 
I cooked my veggies longer to allow them to caramelize, and omitted the sugar (totally not necessary!). I also added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to them. I held off on roasting the minced garlic because it will burn. 

I only used 1 extra large bouillon cube for the pasta and didn't salt the water before hand. Bouillon is super salty as it is. I omitted the wine because we didn't have any. I'm sure it would have been a nice addition. 

I added chicken to my meal which I had marinated a few hours in Italian dressing. I cut it up and sauteed it until the juices ran clear. Just before it was done cooking I added the minced garlic, and a touch of starchy pasta water to cook the garlic and deglaze the pan. I added all of that to the veggies and orzo. 

The flavors of this were awesome, and the bouillon addition to the pasta water was a nice change! I'll try that again for sure.

I don't write reviews typically but this deserves a commendation for it's light summery taste, simple preparation and relative originality. We've made this a few times now and change a couple things here and there from the recipe but in all honestly, just stick with what it recommends.  Goes great with a white wine and if you're like my husband,  you can throw in a pinch of spice to help kick it up a notch.  Sometimes he just goes hog wild with Sriracha. Excellent pot luck recipe as well.

My boyfriend made this for me and it was absolutely delicious. The orzo was incredibly flavorful thanks to the broth, and the roasted veggies were perfectly cooked. // Made this a second time, using balsamic vinegar in place of the wine because it was what I had on hand. Still delicious! I love to save the broth and spoon some into my bowl so it's more of an orzo soup. Sooo good!

Really loved this recipe. Thank you for sharing! I made it without the asparagus simply because it wasn't on sale, but the dish was still so good. I also didn't want to throw wine down the drain, so I adjusted the cooking method for the orzo. I lightly toasted 1 cup of orzo in 2 tablespoons of butter and then added 1 1/4 cups water with a 1 teaspoon of chicken base and a 1/2 cup Sake. I brought that to a boil. Covered. Reduced the heat and let simmer for 15-20 mins until the liquid was absorbed. Then i added in the veges and the Parmesan. It was delish! I will be making it again and again and can't wait for asparagus to go on sale!

This a keeper, I love this recipe. I saute the red onions half way first as my husband is not a fan of onions with to much crunch. Also added extra garlic, and I always have Knox concentrated chicken broth that I used in cooking orzo pasta. Saved a little to mix with the veggies. I would recommend this to anyone

Completely yummy!! And substantial enough to act as an entree. My teenager made this and it was incredible. Good levels of flavor, though not alot of texture if that's important to you. The wine and chicken broth added to the pasta water is something we will mimic in other dishes. We cooked for 25 minutes but would only do 20 next time as some of the smaller veggies were a little burned. Other than that...absolutely no complaints.

This dish was SOOO good!  I forgot to buy the red onion at the store, so I included all the veggies but that one...although I think that you could really mix and match veggies according to your tastes.  The only thing I really disagreed with was serving size info.  I used the amount of veggies it called for, but I just used 4 servings of orzo according to the box (1 cup), not the entire box.  That was perfect for the amount of veggies, and it was probably still more than 4 servings.  Three of us ate the dish, and there was plenty left over.  But it was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I used a blended brown rice instead of the orzo.  When the veggies were done (I had cut them fairly small, and they cooked faster than 20 min.), I added pre-cooked chicken and the rice and put it back in the oven to warm for a few minutes.  I didn't use the wine or the cheese, but neither was missed.

This recipe was awesome! I toasted the orzo first as I like the color of some white, some tan orzo in the recipe. I used a tablespoon of butter before adding cooking liquid and spices so the calorie content/cholesterol content is higher. It was a big a hit at my family gathering.

Loved it! I made the whole box of Orzo as directed, doubled both squash, added red & orange bell pepper, & more onions. I increased the oil because of the additional veggies used. I added Tbs of butter & approx 6 oz of feta cheese after draining pasta. Further I used salt free broth instead of water, in addition to the bouillion. I added about 8 chopped basil leaves & equal amount of parsley to the oil before tossing the veggies. Everyone loved this dish! Keep in mind, never use cooking wine, it will make any dish taste nasty. Buy wine you drink for cooking.

This was super easy to make, wonderfully fresh, and very tasty.  We paired it with a seasoning-encrusted salmon, grilled on cedar planks, which was a perfect companion to this side dish.  We used a local chardonnay for the dry wine called for in the orzo recipe, and then drank the rest with our meal.  Superb!  We will certainly be making this again for company....and it makes a huge amount of food as written even though it may not seem like it before all of the ingredients are added together.  It could also easily be made into a main dish by adding some chopped prosciutto.  So many options for such a healthy and easy recipe.  Thank you!

I just made this last night, and it was sooooo good!  I did follow "Sahmcook's" advice and let the liquid absorb out of the pasta.  I also added 1/2 cup of the cheese. There are 7 of us in my family so I used a lot of veggies. This made a big bowl, with only a bit leftover. The whole family loved it! If you're debating on making it, go for it! You wont be disappointed.

We like orzo. We like roasted veggies. Strangely, we didn't care for this. That said, the veggies I used were eggplant, zucchini, onion, garlic and mushrooms. I had to leave out the wine because I didn't have any. Everything else remained the same. It was okay, but I won't make it again.

Excellent! At the last minute I realized I didn't have zucchini, so I just omitted it and added in a chopped red pepper I needed to use up.  I did want this to be more vegetable-heavy, so I used less orzo (maybe a scant half box) and I still got four servings out of this for a light meal or side dish.  Only other change was to use homemade vegetable stock in place of the bouillon to reduce the sodium (I used about 2 cups stock, 2 cups water and the wine), and I'm sure I went a little heavy on the parmesan! :)  This was light and savory and just delicious - I will make this dish again and again!

This dish was easy to make and was a great healthy side dish. I roasted red bell pepper and eggplant and de-glaced the roasting pan with a little more of the wine. I also toasted the orzo in just a little butter to get a nice brown color on it. It was delicious and a big crowd pleaser. Will try again.

A good basic recipe. Veggies can be substituted for what you have on hand. A little bland but improved with fresh chopped basil and Mrs. Dash's garlic and herb seasoning.

This is a good base recipe, used what veggies I had on hand (eggplant, asparagus and onions) and didn't bother with the white wine.  I also just roasted the veggies with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Used a lot more Parmesean cheese than was called for and added fresh chopped basil and garlic to all.  Good main dish for vegeterians.

Kind of plain as written. I used balsamic rather than sugar but would have liked it with more balsamic yet. Or even some red pepper flakes. Nice healthy option though.

The veggies are the star here. They tasted so good, I couldn't stop nibbling on them while waiting for the pasta to be ready ! I didn't have any asparagus  so I added some green and red bell peppers and half of a chinese eggplant that needed to be used. 
In order for the veggies to have that delicious roasting flavor, you need to have them in one layer. So, unless you are using a jelly roll pan to roast them, you will need to use 2 big cookie sheets. For the Orzo part, I made it as I usually do, I saut√©ed in some butter and olive oil then added  chicken broth, 1 ratio of orzo to 2 of chicken broth, then boil till tender and the broth is all absorbed, about 15 mn.   
This recipe makes a lot more than 4 servings. It could be 6 if you are having it as you main course or 10  as a side dish.

This was so so good. I added eggplant, and used yellow squash. Be sure to cut the zucchini thinner than the squash or the squash will be mushy and the zucchini too crunchy. I cooked the veggies for about 20 minutes at 400; 450 was way too high for my oven. I don't think the sugar is necessary. I've tried it with and without and it didn't seem to make a difference. I've also made this with vegetable bouillon and without white wine and it was still amazing. This is a great base recipe. I think you could put lots of different seasonal veggies and it would still be delicious. Definitely one of my new faves.

This was delicious! I did make some modifications based on previous comments. I added Balsamic Vinegar and thyme to the veggies. I added three times the amount of Parmesan cheese. Lastly, I saut√©ed the orzo in a bit of butter before adding in the chicken broth.

Excellent base recipe.  I did as other reviewers suggested and sauted the orzo in butter first.  I used gluten free orzo and it worked wonderfully.  I added broccoli and left out mushrooms because I didn't have any.  I seasoned it my own way, with some curry powder along with salt and pepper.  It turned out FANTASTIC!  Great base recipe for doctoring up with your favorite seasonings.

Definitely a great base recipe!  I added roasted corn and tomatoes, which added a little sweetness.  I also cooked simmered the orzo in chicken broth and the wine and let it soak up all the flavor. I added some shredded mozzarella as well to make the dish a little creamier.  Overall, I loved this recipe and would try it again in an instant!

This is a very tasty and satisfying meal. I made a few minor changes. I did not add the cheese. I added a handful of pine nuts to the roasted vegetables, and I used vegetable stock instead of chicken.

This will join the rotation.

Delicious as a side dish and makes a lot! I added sweet Vidalia onions instead of red onion and it gave it a nice sweetness without added sugar that was called for. I used 4 tsp of the jarred chicken base that is better than boullion cubes in my opinion. Nice flavor and great to get lots of veggies into side dish. Will definitely make again and use any veggies I have on hand like I did this time.

This was outstanding! Took other suggestions and cut orzo to 1 cup (about right for 2-3 people). Took submitters suggestion and used 1 T balsamic vinegar in place of sugar. Also, added 1/2 cup of grated Reggiano-Paremsan cheese. Veggies I used were, zuccini, red bell pepper, onion, asparagus, brussel sprouts. No mushrooms (wife does not like). I used 2 tsp. of "Better Than Bouillon" and 1/4 cup white wine in 2/1/2 cups of water for orzo. Will definetly be making this on a regular basis!

Delicious! Will def make again! A few mods: different veggies, only about a TSP of chicken bouillon in the cooking water for orzo, no wine, used a touch of balsamic vinegar (as the author later suggested) plus a few dashes of lemon basalmic, extra salt & pepper, just 1 garlic, and unbelievably...NO cheese!! I cannot believe it, as a cheese-LOVER, that this does not need cheese! The flavors of the roasted veggies really make this so wonderful, there's just no need. :)

This was really tasty. Unfortunately, I followed other members advice of adding two bouillons and it ended up being a bit too salty, so I had to add water to dilute it. I did use vegetable bouillons though, so I don't know if that's the reason why. But the taste was incredible, this is a really good side dish.

SO GOOD!!!!!! I subbed quinoa cooked in veggie broth for orzo and added some bell peppers to the veg mix that I had on hand. Didn't have any wine and sauteed the garlic separately to avoid burning. I was generous with the parmesean and couldn't stop eating it! Totally worth all the chopping.

I left out the mushrooms and used an acorn squash but all of my guests loved it.  My cousin who is a manager at a restaurant that serves pretty good food commented on how good it was.  I will definitely make it again.

This is absolutely delicious. The only change I make is to sometimes add fresh herbs; usualy basil. I love to serve this along with grilled chicken or salmon and pesto (hence the fresh basil in the orzo).

This was the perfect side dish to our BBQ chicken tonight.  I didn't have any asparagus, so I tossed in fresh tomatoes before serving, making it colorful as well.  This could really be done with a variety of vegetables.  I think broccoli would work very well.  Great summer recipe!

I followed one of the suggested changes and it was delicious! I sauteed the orzo in some butter and then added the water, wine, and 2 bullion cubes until it was absorbed. This has now become one of my favorite meals!!

I love roasted vegetables, and this recipe is so easy to make and versatile. I used white mushrooms instead of portabello, chicken broth only to cook the orzo in (I didn't have any white wine) and subbed feta cheese for the parmesan. I also added fresh parsley and fresh lemon juice on top to give it more flavor since other reviews said it was lacking. Overall an easy recipe for a light lunch or dinner!

Very Yummy! And so adaptable! I've made this twice now - first time as written, only subbing chicken broth for boullion and water in orzo.  Last night I made it with some grape tomatoes, and no asparagus.  Also used feta instead of parm.  I add a pinch of red pepper flakes to spice things up.  So fresh and healthy!

Great recipe! You can alter the recipe to vegetables you prefer. (I add more mushrooms and zucchini instead of using asparagus) Cooking the orzo with the chicken bouillon does wonders. I've never added dry white wine and it still tastes great.

A good change from a meat dish. Easy prep.  I didd use double the parmesan and the next time I would add more yellow squash and zucchini.  Yum!

This is a good dish - however, not as flavorful as I expected with the seasonings to the pasta water.  Next time I will try some of the suggestions, which include using red peppers, basil and additional salt/pepper.

The roasted vegetables are amazing. I omitted the sugar, and added a little crushed red pepper. I like a little spice to my food. Instead of pairing with orzo, I mixed the veggies with penne pasta. Delish!

Very good, although I did forget the sugar (oops) and added about a teaspoon or two of fresh thyme from the garden. An excellent way to use fresh garden veggies!

I read the reviews on this one and thought about spicing it up. But I went with the stock recipe. All my friends loved it. I thought it could use a little spice. I gave it 5 stars because everyone loved it and with this type of recipe there‚Äôs a lot of room to tailor it to an individuals taste

Awesome, that's all I have to say!! You can throw in just about any veggie and it tastes great. I use Feta cheese instead of the Parmesan though.

It sounded a little bland so I added some garden herbs to it and used hazelnut oil instead of olive, gave it a lovely flavor. I didn't specifically have the same veggies either so I just used what I had on hand and it was great. Very simple to do, very easy clean up, I recommend it as a healthy meal alternative with easy clean up.  ***Update***Made it with beets, carrots, broccoli and added a white onion. truly versatile recipe! I was out of olive oil but had Hazelnut oil and used that. It was WONDERFUL!! I'm changing from 4 stars to 5.

Delicious! I did add a red bell pepper to the vegetables, definitely a good addition. I didn't have any chicken bouillon, so I just used water and a little wine. Hubby picked all the veggies out, but he said the orzo was good. It went very well with salmon, and even though hubby is hopeless when it comes to vegetables, I'll make this again.

Made this tonight and it was a hit. I did make the following changes: I boiled the orzo until al dente then threw them in a saute pan with all the other ingredients and added a little thyme and chicken stock and white wine. I also put some fresh lemon zest and toasted almonds on top along with a healthy heaping of parmesan. It would have been very bland other wise..def. a good base though. Thank you!!

My husband and I thought this was very good.  It is such an easy recipe, and really versatile.  It would make a good side dish, as well as an entree.  Could be easily converted to a vegetarian dish by simply subbing vegetable bouillon for the chicken.  Thanks for sharing!

Hi, I haven't made this recipe yet but I am making it tomorrow - just wondering why not just use Chicken broth instead of water and adding boullions? I can't see it making much of a difference. I'll let you know how it turns out with the broth. If anyone has any input, please don't hesitate. This recipe sounds yummy!

I loved this. It was easy and delicious. You can add any vegetable you like to the roast. I followed the instructions almost to the letter, except the portabellos, I just used the fresh mushrooms I had in the fridge. I will be making this again. I was generous with the pepper and salt on the vegetables. Thanks for the recipe
