Easy and yummy! I like sun dried tomatoes so I usually use 1/2 cup, but that is the only thing i adjust.

Great base line. I added a bit of minced red onion, and may try with a little red wine vinegar next time.

Salad was a bit bland, and very lemony. I think it would be better with a vinaigrette base.

I made this for a 4th of July potluck and loved it.  I tripled the recipe for a crowd, and
it was the perfect size for the gathering.   There were a couple of servings left  which
I enjoyed over the next couple of days.  The flavor was enhanced by  time.  I highly
recommend this pasta salad and am delighted to have it in my recipe box.

So good!  I used fresh cherry tomatoes instead of sun-dried tomatoes and also added chopped cucumbers.  Perfect spring snack for lunch!

Delicious, easy and fresh.  I doubled this recipe for a large party and there was none left at the end.  The only change I made was with the lemon juice and lemon zest:  1 and 1/2 of amounts specified and the lemon flavor was just right.    A reviewer suggested red onion and that sounds real good, so the next time I make this (lots of times) I will add red onion.

The lemon to olive oil was a bit high... I added extra oil and it balanced out the acidity. I also added some cucumbers, extra feta, and italian seasoning and it REALLY amped up the flavor! As others have said, these are good base ingredients but a few things need to be added so that it isn't bland.

I love this salad.  I made it as printed first.  Then I made it again with minor changes. I added around 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar and some salt (to taste.) Delish!  My 10-year old likes it, too, so thatâ€™s a bonus.

I used the suggestions some earlier reviews had made, such as the kalamata olives.  I also added some balsamic vinegar to the artichoke liquid to spice it up a bit more.  Next time I will add some fresh garlic to enhance the flavors.

Great base recipe.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand, and for extra flavor, but it is very good as is!

I used mint instead of parsley and added grated Parmigiano and garlic.

It was light, refreshing and delicious!  I will definitely make it again :0)

My experience with this recipe is that it needed a lot more water than stated. I also felt this recipe is measured for a side dish. I increased the proportions for more servings and definitely had to use at least 4 times more water than stated here, all while trying to stay ahead of how quickly the water was being soaked up.

Other than that, everyone enjoyed the orzo. Very delicious.

The recipe is OK as is which is why I gave it 3 stars. As another reviewer said, it is a good base recipe and is otherwise kind of bland. I added more sun dried tomatoes, feta, olive oil and 1/4 of a red onion. With the adjustments and after sitting awhile, it was very tasty. Overall, good base recipe but needs some jazzing up.
