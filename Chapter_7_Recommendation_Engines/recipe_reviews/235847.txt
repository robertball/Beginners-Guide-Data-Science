This "cheesecake's" texture was a little off-putting. Not thick like a cheesecake, but definitely silky and creamy. Like others, I also tasted a key lime undertone. It definitely needs the raspberry sauce for the sweetness. I can't say I disliked it, but it wasn't a dessert my family cared for, not even my avocado-loving daughter.

This cheesecake is anything but cheesecake. It is not sweet at all. Think of a bland avocado pudding. The consistency is like gelled avocado. It reminds me of those old cookbooks from the 50's and 60's that have nothing but gelatin recipes. The raspberry sauce is this only saving grace, and that is a serving suggestion not the recipe itself. My family wouldn't touch it. I followed the recipe exactly as written as well. I really wanted to like this, but I just couldn't.

If you like different and unique, this is for you!  It tastes like gently sweetened avocados, and the texture is silky and smooth--the crust is wonderful.  I baked it the night before serving, and in true avocado fashion the top browned a little, so if you want to preserve the color, bake the morning you plan on serving it.  I served it with the Raspberry Sauce recipe from this site (just type Raspberry Sauce and it's the very first one), and it was great.  My kids were hesitant to try it, but this would be neat served for a Cinco de Mayo dessert.

I made this recipe with a homemade strawberry sauce...the sauce is a must to counter the fairly savory taste of the cheesecake.  It had a muted key lime pie taste to it...I used freshly grated lemon zest.  Wasn't a fan of the consistency, but other than that, this would probably make a good pudding, too.

I just made this after finding it in a search for light cheesecakes and buying ingredients on my way home last night.  I modified a little - I forgot to bake a full 20 minutes, but then I have a convection oven so the crust should be fine.  I used one giant avocado, added four packets of Stevia and some fresh squeezed lemon juice, and left the zest in.  In my opinion it is rather delicious, but I will have to see what the ladies think at our church meeting this evening.  I will be making a raspberry sauce to top it off.  I have had good success in the past using my VitaMix to puree raspberries with chia seeds to thicken, and will add some Stevia if necessary.

This was delicious! It was VERY sweet to us! 

I followed the recipe as written, but didn't use any low-fat ingredients as our family only buys whole fat foods. We used organic evaporated cane juice. 

I served it with my homemade chocolate raspberry sauce and raspberries! The whole family nodded in approval with stuffed mouths! 

If I didn't make it, I would never have guessed the green was avocados! Very creative recipe! I'll be making it again!

I was pleasantly surprised how delicious this was!  Consider this to be a very light and guilt-free dessert, especially when topped with a fruit medley.  Hubs, my taste tester, practically licked the plate clean.  Thank you Avocados from Mexico for a fantastic recipe!

Very very good! Sort of like key lime... but better! I skipped the raspberry sauce and sprinkled it with chocolate flakes and fresh raspberries! Definitely will make again and again!
