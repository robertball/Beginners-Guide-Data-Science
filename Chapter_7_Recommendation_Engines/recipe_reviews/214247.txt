this recipe was more of a basis to what i wanted to make. the cream cheese with the pudding was excellent. instead of pound cake i used yellow cake mix (betty crocker/devils food) and just broke them into pieces. after slicing the strawberries i sprinkled sugar on them and let them sit while preparing the cream to give them a nice sweet glaze. i didn't use chocolate to drizzle because i didn't want to take away from the strawberry flavor. i just topped with cool whip. YUM.
