This recipe won out over the other Eggplant Parmesan recipes for me because of the addition of ricotta, which I love, and makes it like a delicious pasta-less lasagna.  I made double the amount and had too much sauce (Best Marinara Sauce Yet, here at AllRecipes), which made it a little sloppy when serving, but nonetheless yummy.  Everyone was happy that there was plenty of sauce to mop up with crusty bread!  And hubby has asked that I make it again at the earliest available opportunity.

Degorging (ie salting) is done only to take away bitterness (not make eggplant tender as some reviewers believe), and it is not necessary when you have wonderful tight-skinned, fresh young eggplants.  Degorging actually might contribute to the greasiness of the dish.  (Drawing moisture from eggplants with salt makes the temperature of the oil drop too much when adding them to the pan, hence they absorb more oil.)  I didn't degorge my eggplants, and used a non-stick pan with a smear of extra-virgin olive oil.  Very little fat, and no bitterness.

My family loved this recipe.  Her's how I made it: peeled the eggplant, sliced  it, and salted it with sea salt.  Let it sit in the colander for 4-6 hours, to sweat it out good.  Rinsed the eggplant in water and dried on paper towels.  Dipped slices in egg then italian bread crumbs then browned in skillet for about 2 minutes each side.  I used Classico Tomato Basil sauce, therefore I didn't add as much basil, like the recipe calls for.  For cheese I used a sm. tub of ricotta (15 oz) and a 8 oz bag mozzerella and a sm. bag parmesean.  My husband loved all of the cheese and told me this one is a keeper.

I became very interested in this dish when I was searching for eggplant recipes. However, I quickly became frustrated when I began to fry the eggplant in olive oil. You see, eggplant mysteriously soaks up olive oil requiring me to add more and more and more and...you get the picture. The recipe should have called for a batter of some type to prevent the oil soaked soggy patties I ended up with.

I cheated. I fried the eggplant after dipping it in milk and breadcrumbs. I coated the eggplant in a large plastic bag as one reviewer suggested, and that sure kept things from getting messy! What makes this a five-star for me was the addition of the ricotta cheese mixture. I spread all of that in a middle layer: Sauce, eggplant, mozzarella, parmesan, repeat, then the ricotta mixture, sauce eggplant, mozzarella, parmesan, repeat. Excellent! Thanks for having my guests declare that my eggplant parmesan was the best they had ever tasted (and I thought I had already conquered this dish)!

This was wonderful and was a big hit.  I made a few changes based on other reviewers suggestions.  I sliced the eggplant about 1/4 inch thick and allowed it to sweat for about 2 hours.  I also cut way down on the oil for frying the eggplant - just a smidge in a non-stick pan.  I used my own homemade sauce.  Although not difficult per se, there are quite a few steps to this recipe and I wanted it to be worth the time, so I made several smallish tins of it and froze them.  They defrost great and are a wonderful and quick work-night treat!  Thanks for sending this in - it will certainly become one of my regular dishes!

Excellent recipe – I breaded the eggplant slices and used cooking spray to brown them.  Next time I’ll try without the breading.  The only other change I made was to leave out the egg from the ricotta mixture, since one person was allergic to eggs.

When assembling, instead of trying to smooth out the ricotta mixture, I just put a dollop on each eggplant round, then put another eggplant round right on top of that, then added another ricotta dollop.  Instead of having an even casserole, I had 12 individual eggplant mounds that were easy and attractive to plate.

The best eggplant parmesan I've ever had. Next time I think I will double the ricotta mix. That will help use up the whole tub and will fill the cheese layers out more. Be sure to allow time for this to cool, as it will be soupy and hard to serve if you try to cut it directly after pulling it out of the oven.

Very good! I also rolled the eggplant pieces in italian breadcrumbs and then fried them. I made it for my family and they loved it. We ate almost the whole pan. It's a keeper!!

This was great!!  When I used one eggplant I only ended up with a bottom layer and a top layer so I put all of the cheese mix in the middle and I added  a little mozzerella on the top.  When in the oven I stopped baking after about a half hour and then broiled it for about 2 minutes (or until the mozz is brown) and it was GREAT!!  Boyfriend said "This is the best meal you've made...and I'm not just saying that to be nice."

I've made this recipe twice with excellent results! The only change I made was in cooking the eggplant.  I spray cookie sheet with olive oil, lay eggplant in single layer, spray eggplant with olive oil and bake in 400 degree oven for 20 minutes or till soft.  I find this much less labour intensive and less calories without too much oil. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe, and my first time for this dish, The Hubster dubbed it best Italian dish I ever cooked! I doubled everything except the basil; my homemade fresh tomato sauce had plenty of fresh basil already in it and I only used one egg. Did not sweat the eggplant, I just parboiled it in salted boiling water for 2 minutes. Rinsed the slices in cold water, pressed them between thick layers of paper towels to completely dry and removed the skins. Made two 8x8 pans and put one in the freezer uncooked, for later. We loved the texture of the eggplant without breading, my slices did not absorb much oil, I doubt I needed the whole 8 Ts. Only change I made that was unusual is Smoked Mozerella from Trader Joes...YUMMY! I froze the cheese before shredding/grating, sure makes it easier. Pre-shredded cheese often has weird ingredients in it to keep it from sticking together, and freshly grated just feels better to me! Thanks to Karen for making me look like a pro...served with homemade yeast garlic rolls and fresh salad greens. Will post a photo tonight! UPDATE: this dish didn't survive long enough to take photos! We tore through this like wild animals!

The ricotta and the fresh basil makes this great. Like another reviewer had suggested, after the sweating process, I too placed them in a 400 degree oven for approx. 20 minutes spraying the bottom of the cookie sheet with olive oil spray at the tops of the eggplant. This eliminated any excess oil being absorbed by the eggplant as well as the extra time of frying.For those of you who have always breaded the eggplant, forget that entire step. The cheese mixture maked this dish excellent. Thank You for Sharing

This turned out the best eggplant parmesan I have ever had.  The cheese filling makes it reminiscent of lasagna, and seemingly very decadent even though a generous serving is well under 200 calories with my changes, I'm pretty sure.  My changes were:  1. After sweating the eggplant slices, I dusted them with flour, dipped them in beaten egg thinned with a little water, then in Italian bread crumbs.  2. Sprayed the breaded eggplant slices with cooking spray and browned in a nonstick skillet.  3. Reduced the mozzarella cheese by 1/2 and didn't miss it.  Also, used part-skim ricotta and an egg white instead of a whole egg to bind the cheese filling.

This is a great recipe! As it is written I give it 4 stars. With a little added ingredients I would give it 5. I could tell right off that the cheese filling would take the eggplant and sauce right to the top and it did! This recipe can stand on it own but I like mushrooms so I added some sauteed crimini mushrooms on top for an added meaty texture. Also, I sided with the egg wash and Italian bread crumbs before browning the eggplant. Oh yea, and I didn't sweat the eggplant as I purchased ripe young plants. The flavors were beautiful!

Another way to prepare the eggplant is to soak it in cold, salted water (6 cups water and 2 TBSP salt for 30 min.  Drain well and pat dry w/ paper towels.

I think this might be the best dish I've ever made! However, I substituted heavily for what I had on-hand:

My eggplant was small, so I also used slices of zucchini and yellow squash.

I had no ricotta and only a little mozzarella, so I placed slices of provolone over the eggplant and squash, then mixed the shredded cheese I had on hand (a little motz, some 5-cheese Italian blend and Parmesan) with the egg. I forgot to put the basil in the mixture, so I just layered it on top.

I only had a half-jar of pasta sauce and used it on the bottom layer. For the top layer, I used 8 oz. tomato sauce with a little water to thin it out, mixed with two cloves of fresh pressed garlic and some dried Italian seasonings spice mix.

I also used fresh chopped tomato on top  before sprinkling with the remaining parm.

OH MY, SOOOO GOOOD.

PS - No need to peel your eggplant, there's lots of fiber in the skin, and it doesn't detract from the taste or texture. 

Also, you can skip the salting, etc. in Step 1 if your eggplant is fresh and firm-skinned.

This was amazing.  Eating dishes like this make it easy to be a vegetarian!  Finding a meal without meat that my family enjoys is such a blessing.  Night after night I make separate dishes for my meat eating family but after finding this, it makes one meal a bit easier.  Even my husband (who is dead SET on eating meat) enjoyed it!  My picky 20 month old ate his whole plate.  It's a satisfying meal when you can enjoy a meatless meal with your family!

*After trying to make this meal a few times, I realized that baking the eggplant wasn't cooking the bread crumbs enough.  They were still somewhat "soggy" so I fried them in Light Olive Oil until brown (as you would when making chicken parmesan), gave it better flavor and a nice crisp breading.  

I recommend this meal to anyone who wants to break the cycle and try something new!

This is so very, very good. As others have said, it's a lot like a pasta-less lasagna, and that's perfectly fine for me. Nothing wrong with pasta, but it's a bit too heavy and best saved for special occasions. This, however, is actually pretty light and can satisfy your hunger without making you feel like you just ate a cinder block made of flour. 

This has made it into my weekly rotation, too. The cheese, depending on how you buy it, can last for two or three preparations which means you only have to buy the eggplant over (don't keep them more than a week. Ew.), so in all it's a very cost-effective meal. It's just my boyfriend and me, too, so for us one prep means a stack of two slices per serving. So one dinner and a bunch of leftovers for lunch to take to work, which brings me to the next great thing about this: it reheats beautifully! 

A couple things, however: I find that sweating the eggplant for an hour instead of half an hour leads to a much better flavor (and if you're new to eggplant, this really is not a step you can skip). When I brown the eggplant, I use A LOT less oil. Maybe a couple tablespoons. To each their own, but eggplant is super absorbant and it's far too easy to get disgusting, greasy slices. Experiment, I guess. Also, I use my own homemade sauce. I imagine using storebought sauce would lead to a much heavier meal as most of those are laden with corn syrup for bulking and preserving. But again, to each their own. I'm sure it's phenomenal, regardless!

I actually peeled and sliced this lengthwise to replace noodles for lasagna feel - it made spreading the cheese much easier.   I also did not fry the eggplant.   I used cottage cheese and egg, parmesan and mozz for the cheese filling.  Layered and baked for 45 minutes.   Broil for 5 minutes to get that nice brown cheese and it was awesome!

I gave this 4 stars but with the changes I made I think it deserves 5 stars.  
*I breaded & fried the eggplant slices (dredge in flour, dip in egg and coat with bread crumbs). 
*I used meat sauce (ground beef fried and added to your favorite sauce). 
*I used parmesan cheese with the ricotta mixture and mozzarella on top.
This rivals the best dishes I've had at Italian restaurants.

This was fantastic after using a lot of the reviewers suggestions.  Served it at a large family gathering and young and old ate heartily.  Used Classico Tomato Basil sauce, didn't measure, used my eye, but used a lot less sauce than the recipe called for, didn't add any extra basil, might do that the next time but good without it, brushed eggplant with oil and fried in a lot less oil, also added sliced garlic cloves to eggplant while frying (excellent taste), lastly peel the eggplant (not in the recipe but I think submitter assumed we knew to do that). I'm a newbie vegetarian (4 months) and I know I will definitely make this again and again.

I will never, ever again bread my eggplant.  This recipe tops all other efforts I have made.  It is without a doubt the best I have made and I have thrown out all past recipes.  This one stays!

This is a great dish...however, I dipped the sliced eggplant in beaten eggs,then coated in panko breadcrumbs & fried in pan of canola oil(I like eggplant parm crispy!!!).  Then baked as per recipe.

Excellent if made by recipe but 2 eggplant are necessary if you want to do the double layer unless you want to slice the eggplant thinner. Also, I used 12 oz of ricotta. This is now a family favorite!

This was outstanding. I salted the eggplant and let them sit for 30 minutes before rinsing them in cold water to get the bitter taste out. I then followed this recipe. It was delicious!

Another modifier here!

Here's exactly what I did: Preheated oven to 350, sliced two eggplant into rings and three medium-sized zucchini lengthwise.  Sprayed both sides of veggies with olive oil via my Misto, placed them on baking sheets and cooked for 10 minutes.  Mixed 15 oz ricotta, 12 oz mozzarella, an egg and basil, and 2 24 oz jars of sauce and layered everything per the recipe.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING RESULTS!  Looked scrumptious, tasted scrumptious, my kids had never eaten eggplant before and loved it served over hot penne tossed with olive oil and parmesan.  I will make this a few times a month from now on!

Useful info from this site regarding prepping eggplant: 

If you choose to salt your eggplant, first slice or cube it, and then salt generously, allowing the fruit to sit in a colander for at least an hour, preferably longer. Salted eggplant can sit purging for hours without harming the taste or texture. 

BUT...before cooking the eggplant, be sure to rinse the salt off well. THEN place the slices between sheets of paper towel and press gently to remove juices and firm the flesh. This is particularly important when frying your eggplant slices or cubes.

My family and I did not like this recipe at all.  I am giving it 2 stars on the basis that we were able to eat it the night I made it.  What a shame to waste the time and money.  Here's what I found wrong:  First off, 1 eggplant was not nearly enough to make more than 1 layer in a 13 x 9 pan.  I used a HUGE eggplant that weighed at least 2-3 pounds and it still only gave me 1-1/2 layers.  Second, as others have pointed out, the eggplant took such a long time to brown (at least 20 minutes for this step alone, which makes the prep time in the recipe off) and soaked up every bit of the olive oil to where I had to add more for each batch to brown (more than the 8 Tbs called for in the recipe).  This in turn made the eggplant goopy and oily.  Gross!  Lastly, there was too much sauce.  The end result was hard to serve, a goopy, saucy mess.

So glad to see a recipe for eggplant parm that is not breaded. This is how I normally make. Growing up in a Sicilian home(parents came from Terrassini) this is how my mother made. I have however brushed eggplant with extra virgin olive oil and bake the it on high heat instead of frying! I give it a 4 because I use Pecorino Romano cheese, also what we had growing up.

I would like to give this more stars. This was tasty, but I had very mushy texture. I think, as another person said, it was the lack of batter before frying, because it's true- eggplant soaks up oil like crazy! It would have been good if not for the mushiness.

Very good--4.5. I let the eggplant sweat for about an hour, breaded it and cooked it in a pan for a few minutes each side, using cooking spray and very little oil. I also mixed some prepared garlic (about 2 cloves) in the cheese mixture. Next time I will use more eggplant and maybe cut it a little thinner.

I cut the eggplant very thinly (about 1/4 in) then "browned" them in a non-stick skillet of medium-high heat for about 3 minutes per side (they don't necessarily brown though...just soften). Then I sauteed two summer squashes with one onion until soft, but not mushy. I added three cloves minced garlic toward the end. Then I layered sauce, eggplant, cheese mixture, squash and onion, sauce... Then topped with lots of mozzarella and parm cheese. It was a hit! My two year old and husband even really enjoyed this 'no pasta lasagna'.

I dream about this dish! I would make it a lot more only whenever I do, my boyfriend and I usually end up eating the whole thing in a day or two! I followed suggestions from other reviewers and recipes and dipped the eggplant in egg and breadcrumbs before browning.

Excellent! I dippled the eggplant in an egg wash first and then into bread crumbs and fried them in olive oil. Made them stay nice and crunchy before going into oven.

my large eggplant only gave me four stacks, 3 layers high. This was fine since it was just my boyfriend eating. I spooned the cheese mixture onto each layer and only used as much as I felt was needed. I also only needed about half the pasta sauce listed. I didn't have fresh basil and used dried instead, which turned out wonderfully. I love this recipe because it is easy and can be adjusted to suit personal tastes.

This is truly an excellent recipe.  It is good both as a stand alone dinner or as a side.  The only change I make is to use only one tablespoon of olive oil.  I use a 12 inch covered frying pan and cook over medium heat, turning every few minutes until the eggplant is tender.  I have also added chicken breast, pounded thin and sauteed, to the layers of eggplant with great results.

Frying the eggplant only makes it soak up the oil.  I had trouble with sticking to the pan and ended up boiling the eggplant which added to the prep time.

Triple the amount of eggplant and make 1.5 times the cheese mixture, and use the same amount of sauce. It will still fit in a 9x13 dish, and it's delicious.   Degorging the eggplants isn't completely necessary, and rather than frying them in olive oil (they soak up loads of oil) I use a non-stick griddle and canola oil spray for a lower-fat version.

I prepared this lovely recipe last night and both of us decided it is a "keeper".  I love that it requires no breading for the eggplant.  I peeled my eggplant and cut into approx. 1/2" slices before "sweating" them.  I also used part skim ricotta and mozzarella to further cut down on fat.  I added 1 large finely minced clove of garlic to the cheese/egg mixture.  The result was awesome!  Using fresh basil is also key.  Served it over Angel Hair pasta and enjoyed a lovely Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon with it. I found this recipe made 4 large servings over pasta.

This was so wonderful - tasted just like the restaurant kind!  Fresh basil is key!!  I used only 1 Tbl. olive oil when sauteeing the eggplant - really didn't need any more.  I reduced the fat in the cheese mixture by using reduced fat ricotta, then adding about 1/2 cup nonfat yogurt to make it more spreadable.  No difference in taste!  I found the final casserole to be a bit on the saucey side (which is better than dry!), so next time I think I'll add another eggplant (or reduce the amount of sauce a bit).  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I've been making eggplant parmesan for many years but mine was not as good as this recipe.  I've been using this one for the past couple years.  The addition of ricotta is a real winner.  I add garlic to the ricotta and when I have it, some fresh oregano.  I never fry eggplant (or squash) for casseroles.  Instead, I spray the slices with Pam and broil until brown on both sides.  And I don't bother with salting the slices if I am using garden-fresh eggplant.  Also, I use homemade marinara sauce.  I always make two casseroles---one for dinner and one to freeze.  Thanks for a delicious and easy dish, Karen.

Wow, I can't believe I just ate two generous helpings of this marvelous dish! After reading comments by other reviewers, I made some changes as suggested and as necessitated by ingredients on hand. First, since I didn't have ricotta cheese in the fridge, I substituted low fat cottage cheese. Also, used Eggbeaters to keep cholesterol down, used dried Mediterranean basil (can't wait to try it with fresh); and to satisfy my need for additional protein, I browned and drained ground lamb and garlic and added to spaghetti sauce; and topping cheese was parmesan reggiano. After salting and rinsing medium sized eggplant, I dried eggplant slices with paper towel before browning. Sprayed pan with butter flavored Pam and only needed a tablespoon of olive oil for each batch, thus cutting down on fat. I'll make this often and appreciate both the submitter of the recipe as well as reviewers. Delicious!

The BEST eggplant!  I used the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site with it (simmer awhile if you don't want a strong wine flavoring).  It did take a LOT of eggplant - about 3 for one 9 x 13 dish...Maybe because I SQUEEZED out all the brown juices after they were salted and sat for 30 minutes.  
I ended up with a little more than the total 4 cups sauce called for. I added the extra which was a little too runny for dish I served right away, but fine for the one served later that evening.
Even though I'm contemplating DOUBLING the moz / ricotta mixture next time, I must say my guests ALL loved this...was told the best some had EVER had!! (and no breading!) Thanks.

This recipe was very good.  The second time I made it, I browned some ground beef with onions and mushroom and mixed them with the canned marinara sauce.  I also didn't fry the eggplant the second time and it still came out great.

We really enjoyed this dish. An easier and lower fat / calorie way to precook the eggplant is to spray it with oil or brush a little on, then put it under the broiler until it browns. Turn the slices and repeat oiling and broiling. I've never found it necessary to rub with salt first. I also substitute cottage cheese, whizzed in the food processor for the ricotta.

This is a great recipe. However there were a few big changes I needed to make.  1) unless you get an unusually large eggplant, you will likely need to have 3 eggplant or slice MUCH thinner than 3/4-inch. You won't have 2 layers unless you do this. Plus, I can't imagine feeding 8 people on one eggplant. 2) eggplant soaks up oil when it is fried, so you will need A LOT more than 8 Tbs. 3) peel the eggplant. The skin on an eggplant is kind of tough. 4) I added 2 cloves of garlic. It just seemed like basil wasn't enough. That change is optional, but the first three aren't.

this is a really great simple classic eggplant parmesan - that is not breaded and then fried or baked.   When executed with fresh home made marinara and some added garlic (i like more garlic, and also lots of cracked pepper), and really fresh for the basil and all the cheeses.... it is sublime and perfect with garlic bread and salad!

Flavor is great but +1 on being too soupy. I'm going to use the left overs as a sauce on some Rotini pasta.
I added some grilled onion and garlic. Would have added some oregano but couldn't find it, added salt and pepper instead.

Very good. This was my first time making eggplant parmesan. I'm trying to explore new avenues for plant-based vegetarian foods. This was very good. MY husband liked it very much, and my 2 yr. old devoured it. My 3, 6, and 8 year olds weren't as receptive, but I think they'd eat it again since all of it was eaten. I cut down on the sauce since my eggplant was small, and omitted the basil. Would definitely make this again. Thanks!

I too would not have rated this recipe highly based on the original version.  I used far more eggplant; once breading it and once parboiling, drying, and frying in non-stick spray.  The second time I used provalone cheese on the top, along with the remaining parmesan.  Once the dish was cooked I moved the rack up and bubbled the cheese by broiling it a couple of minutes.

Sorry but I still like my own recipe much better.  I'm more of a just plain mozzarella kind of a guy.  Never did care for ricotta.  The only thing I got out of this to make my own recipe better was to use the fresh chopped basil.

I first want to say that it tastes really good. That being said, it's all sauce! I feel like I made a creamy spaghetti sauce and stirred a little eggplant in. I actually cooked some pasta so I could use up all the excess sauce. I only used 3 cups of sauce and I probably could have used half of that and it would have been fine.  If I make this again, I think I will add lasagna noodles to the pan, or at least double the eggplant.

Great recipe!  I'm not fond of eggplant, but this was really good & made even better using my homemade tomato sauce.  Liked that the eggplant wasn't breaded and then fried before layering into the casserole.

The taste was really good. The fresh basil was really nice. You need to use a big eggplant cut into big pieces. I think next time, I will use a little less sauce, but it really tasted great. Thanks!!

Using one eggplant, of average size, was definitely too little.  I should have used 2 or 3, and I would bread it next time, as well.  I also added more sauce and doubled the mozzarella, as my family can never get enough.  I may have to add pasta to this dish because it will, otherwise, be too sparse.  Otherwise, it was great and will serve as my base.

This is my first time cooking or making an egg plant dish. It was really good and easy to make. One thing I did forget to do was mix the mozzarella cheese with the ricotta so I ended up, cooking the dish for 25 min and adding the mozzarella on top and cooked until bubbly. I think it was better this way. I also did what other reviews suggested and dipped the egg plant into bread crumbs and then cooked in the pan and baked. I would have used 15 oz of ricotta also. My husband loved the dish and I will definitely be making it again.

I followed some advice by others and just roasted the eggplant slices after spraying both sides with cooking spray, for about 20 mins. at 400 degrees. It worked great, and I liked not having to fry them in oil and also kept the dish healthier. I would definitely recommend slicing the eggplant in thick slices as called for. However, I found in doing so that I needed more eggplant, as I had too much sauce. Next time, the only other change I would make is using 2 eggplant instead of one. Thanks for the fabulous recipe....it was perfect for my vegetarian night!

I ran into the same issue with the eggplant soaking up the olive oil, so instead of wasting an entire eggplant trying to fry them, I went ahead and dipped the eggplant into an egg wash and into some bread crumbs. I also used tomato + basil pasta sauce instead of adding fresh basil. It was delicious. I didn't add any salt because there was plenty in the pasta sauce. It was quick and my fiance really enjoyed it.

I made this over the week-end for my 34 year old daughter's birthday dinner. It was a huge success. She liked it better than what she gets when she goes to an Italian restaurant in Richmond, Maggiano's and that was a GREAT compliment. I will be making this again many times.

This dish didn't go over well with us at all. The sauce and cheese mixture was good but the eggplant was very mushy & watery & fell apart. Also, even though the sauce was good there was far too much of it. Overall this dish required far too much effort for not enough return.

This recipe got rave reviews from my father-in-law and mother-in-law. I made a few adjustments due to lack of ingredients.  First, I put a layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan, followed by a layer of fresh tomatoes sprinkled with fresh garden chives. Next, I didn't have ricotta so I used a roasted garlic feta cheese for the cheese mixture with about 3 tablespoons of cottage cheese.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was fabulous.

When I made this recipe there where several who had never tried eggplant. They loved it,I know because they ate plenty. I just made some linquine noodles to lay the eggplant on, so the sauce amount was just fine.Thanks for a really good recipe.

I love using this recipe as a jumping off point.  I use 3 eggplants, brush them liberally with olive oil and bake about 20 minutes until tender.  I do he same with 4 zuccini thinly sliced longwise.  Then I saute 10 oz of sliced mushrooms and throw in 10 oz fresh spinach in the last minute of cooking.  I layer the vegetables with pasta sauce and the cheese mixture and top with mozarella and parmesan and cook according to the recipe.  It's a little time consuming, but totally worth it.

I loved this recipe - but had to change it to make it work for me.  I used very little sauce - maybe a cup - and instead added layers of fresh tomatoes.  I also layered with fresh spinach leaves and mushrooms and baked it all together.  It turned out great!  There were only three of us, but there weren't any leftovers!

This was INCREDIBLE with these changes:  I used 2 boxes of Trader Joe's breaded eggplant slices ('cause each box is like 1 sliced eggplant and previous reviewers stated 1 sliced eggplant isn't enough) and 3 cups spaghetti sauce-everything else I left the same.  I baked per recipe's instructions and it was rich and delicious!  Easily fed 5 people with salad and garlic toast.  This is a fantastic recipe-the fact that it is vegetarian is a real bonus!

Hmmm...I don't know how others have happily made this recipe with only one eggplant!  Thankfully I had a spare in the fridge.  In a 9x13 pan, there is no way I could have gotten more than one layer without the second eggplant... and it would have been WAY too much cheese otherwise.  I baked the eggplants instead of frying them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Not bad...very rich...but I doubt I will do it again.

The major problem with this recipe, is that it was very little eggplant to sauce and cheese. I felt like I was just eating sauce and cheese, with an occasional taste of eggplant. I used one pretty good-sized eggplant too.

I've made this dish before I saw it here, but with the following differences: I of course make my own secret marinara sauce. I do not salt the eggplant, but do coat with egg & seasoned bread crumbs and fry. In the ricotta goes: 1 beaten egg, 1/4cup milk, 1/4cup of fresh chopped basil-also a pinch of each of the following: salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, dried  oregano, & sugar. This makes the ricotta aliitle more creamy and abit tastier. Also I do not add Mozzerlla & parmesan, they are for topping only. I put down one layer of sauce then one of eggplant, more sauce, then fill with cheese mixture. Add another layer of sauce, then one of eggplant. Then one more layer of sauce and finally mozzerlla & parmesan cheese. bake for 45 minutes on 325. This should really be called Eggplant Lasagna!! Great meatless dish!!

This was my first time both eating and making Eggplant Parmesan.  I omitted the salt sweating process and simply fried the unpeeled eggplant in peanut oil and proceeded with the recipe.  It was absolutely delicious.  I didn't know what I'd been missing, and if you are a food combiner, this is perfect for your diet.

This is wonderful! Although the recipe does not say, I peel the eggplant first. I still bread and fry it to make it really tender. Definately a keeper!

1 inch slices of eggplant were too thick!  I breaded and fried them and then cooked it in the casserole for over 45 minutes and the eggplant still wasn't done.  I will try it again and see if thin slices works better.  Anyone else have this problem?  I had never cooked with eggplant before and thought maybe it would cook down in the oven........

Really, really good.  The only thing that I did differently is that I dipped the eggplant in egg and flour and dipped in Italian bread crumbs.

As someone that's never had eggplant before, I figured I'd give this a shot. My only concern is that I have a ton of sauce and I feel like it's a bit of a waste because my eggplant slices are kind of drowning. I think next time I'll lighten up on that aspect and try again. It's very delicious otherwise.

I followed the general concept of this recipe, but breaded the eggplant before frying it.  Turned out amazing.  My daughter couldn't get enough and I felt it was better than my regular lasagna I make with pasta.

I can only give this 4 stars because the recipe itself is tastey but comes out a little soupy and kind of a mess. I changed it to fit my needs by doing adding crumbed sausage, using 16oz cottage cheese with 3 eggs, and adding to it fresh garlic, parsely, basil, a small amount of bread crumbs and olives. This made it solidify and be more lazagna-like.

I can't get enough of this dish! Hearty but not heavy. Last time I made it was when my parents were in town and my dad acted like it was the best thing he's eaten since I left home over 10 years ago. I agree that it's a great side or main dish. I eat it plain or served over a bed of pasta. My only improvement is I throw in cottage cheese if I have any but it is still great without it. Would be good with spinach, broccoli, or grated carrots added.

I've tried lots of recipes from this web site and this might be the very, very best.  Certainly the best of the eggplant parmesan recipes.  I live in Moscow and don't have access to ricotta - cottage cheese actually worked just fine.  We will have this again and again!

I make this with fresh eggplant every year- my roommates look forward to it and ask when I am going to make it!  I bread and fry the eggplant so it has some crisp to it- but the ricotta cheese makes it taste so decadent!

I ate something similar at a restaurant, and wanted to try this approach to eggplant. To make it more lasagna-like, I sliced the eggplant more like 1/4" thick, and only briefly sauteed the slices before putting them in the pan. It was fabulous, and the proportions of cheese, sauce, and eggplant listed here were pretty much perfect.

This was my first try at an eggplant parm and it was delicious! My only suggestion would be to amp up the flavors a bit with some garlic and pepper.  I actually had no ricotta and substituted with small-curd cottage cheese and it came out great.

This was WAY better than I thought it would be. For some reason I thought I would need to double the recipe for just the 4 of us and it was WAY too much. But still very delicious. I did follow the other reviews and breaded the eggplant before frying it. And I didn't notice the fresh basil when I went shopping so I just used a little basil seasoning. I also think we used a little too much sauce on ours.

This was very good. Even my husband who doesn't like eggplant ate this and said it was good. I did use a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar cheese because I did not have enough mozzarella and it turned out great. Also added some fresh garlic and onion powder to the eggplant while browning in the oil.

This was great! The whole family loved it, including my 15mo! After reading several reviews, I decided to drop the eggs from the cheese mixture, bread the eggplants before frying, and bake in separate portions (only 2 layers). I also made side olive oil spaghetti, on which I lay the eggplant portions. Turned out excellent!

This was so good! I'm 39 weeks pregnant and was doing this as a last resort and had resigned myself to the idea that it would be gross. Took another reviewers idea and coated the eggplant in milk and used breadcrumbs first. Then followed the recipe. Yummy!

I made this last night and it was fantastic! I didn't have any ricotta cheese hanging around, which was sad, but the recipe did well without it. For extra flavor and texture I used mushrooms stir fried with garlic in olive oil--the flavour of this addition was wonderful. I imagine that using a good marinara is key, I used a canned pasta sauce that my household likes.

Delicious. The only change I made was that I breaded the eggplant slices before putting them on the stove. I dipped them in flour then egg then breadcrumbs and followed all teh other steps exactly. Everyone enjoyed it!

This recipe enlightened me on how to make Eggplant Parmesan. I however changed it up a bit. I sliced 1/4 thick, used flour that I added basil, oregano, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, & onion powder. I dipped the eggplant in milk then into flour mixture, then I fried in olive oil & when browning began I drizzled milk over the eggplant while frying. I layered eggplant, sauce, mozzarella, Monterrey jack, ricotta, & cottage cheese. Then on top I used the same frying process w/ a zucchini & topped the dish w/ fried zucchini. It was amazing. My husband, 5 yr old, & almost 1yr old loved it. Thanks!

This recipe is great with a few additions. Maybe try it baked right onto a slice of garlic bread

This is the way I make my eggplant parmigiana all the time, with the exception of frying the eggplant in vegetable oil instead of the olive oil, I usually use my deep fryer. This particular time I did omit the ricotta, only because I didn't have any. That does make a wonderful addition, and puts this over the top. I do prefer to use 2 eggplants, we prefer thicker layers. Just play around with this recipe, depending on the size of the eggplants being used, you may need more than one to fill a 9x13 pan. This is one of my favorite dishes and I serve this over linguine with a side of garlic bread. You could easily add more mozzarella also, just "eyeball" to suit your tastes. :)

This was a great recipe, but I would use less sauce and make sure the eggplant slices are no less than the reccommendation.

It's simple and quick. I baked my eggplant, and used a little less cheese. I gave 5 stars because it was delicious  and it is a no fuss, very easy recipe, even my kids ate it!

This was ok, but for some reason the eggplant's skin was tougher than I thought it would be.  My niece and sister loved it so I might try it again.

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the recipe pretty much as written.  The only changes made were:  1) sliced the eggplant thinner, more like ¼ inch slices  2) made sure to press the extra water out of the eggplant slices with paper towel after sweating them  3) cut a lot of calories by using Pam to fry the eggplant slices.   Will definitely make this again!

This was my first time making anything with eggplant and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! The recipe was easy to follow and had only a few ingredients which I love! I decided to add dried basil and a garlic powder to the cheese mixture for a little extra flavor, and I opted to use a premade jarred sauce that was a little spicy for extra kick! Instead of baking it all in one pan, I made two "trays" out of heavy aluminum foil and filled each with one layered stack of eggplant slices and cheese mixture and covered each with the sauce and lots of parmesan! I placed each "tray" in the larger pan to catch any spills. My boyfriend and I each had a nice looking plate and the clean up was a snap! I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone wanting to give Eggplant Parmesan a try!

I had never made eggplant before but the kids, home from college were asking for it..so I tried this. EVERYONE came back for seconds, loved it. I cured it with iodized salt, not sea salt as I had none at home. I also spread the ricotta very thin and had a little lfet over, a family preference to have just a bit of ricotta.  I also made my own tomatoe sauce..it was a meat sauce. This is a KEEPER, will definately try it again.

We liked this but made some changes. Did place the salted slices in paper towels to drain all the liquids. Rinsed the slices and covered them with a kitchen cloth for a couple of minutes, in order to drain any remaining juice of the eggplant. Also floured the slices before frying them. Used light cottage cheese instead of ricotta (for personal preference) and mixed in some frozen spinach (thawed and drained, of course). Next time I'm going to top it with bechamel sauce. Thank you!

I was hunting a parmesan recipe and found this one.  It is actually more of an eggplant lasagna.  Delicious!!!  This will become a staple at my house since we have to fix low-carb meals.

...Wow..was I ever disappointed in this recipe. I followed the ingredients and directions with NO changes. It took over 45 minutes to prepare and when it was done? Was like this soupy tomatoe/cheese  SAUCE. I wanted to try it because the eggplant was not egg-dipped then fried with breadcrumbs. Definitely not worth the time, nor the money for ingredients. Gonna stick with my favorite eggplant parm' recipe from now on. Sorry.

Really good recipe. I used part skim ricotta and 2% Italian blend shredded cheese. Served with whole wheat baguette bread and made "Simple Tiramisu" for dessert. Turned out great. I think I'll peel the eggplant next time or maybe use zuchinni in its place.

Had something very similar to this in Italy! It is delicious, although I prefer the fried eggplant myself. I guess it doesn't make much of a difference as I still enjoyed it...best served with Garlic bread.

Absolutely wonderful! I was looking for a recipe for my garden eggplant and tried this. My husband and I both loved it. I used fat free cottage cheese(only because that was in my fridge) in place of the ricotta and it was great. I was a little skeptical at first because most recipes call for breaded eggplant but this is so much better---and healthier!!

I quite enjoyed this dish, but I did change the directions and ingredients. I did not pan brown the eggplant slices, baking them instead with their bread crumb coating ( I used Italian crumbs)for 10 minutes. Rather than topping with chesse and basil, I also added italian seasoning, parsley flakes, and oregano for more flavor. These spices, combined with the ricotta made this a delicious meal. I would like to experiment with spinach ricotta next time.

Loved It!  I must have gotten a really small eggplant -- I only had one layer, but I put a dollop of the ricotta mixture on each slice and covered with sauce & parmesan.  It was fantastic.

Tastewise, this recipe is worth a 4 stars rating: not the best eggplant parmesan I've tried but still a very good one. The problem is you can't do anything with only one eggplant!

This recipe was very satisfying. Be sure to use a red sauce that is more tart than sweet or cornstarchy, so that it counterbalances the creaminess of the cheese filling.

This was delicious and very easy. It took a while to make, but I was able to do laundry, iron and read while waiting on the eggplant to drain and then cook (so, didn't mind the length). The olive oil gave the eggplant a great flavor and made the dish very tasty! I used Classico Tomato Basil sauce and had to use dry basil because I didn't have fresh. Still very good!

Delicious and very easy to make.  My husband and I loved it - our kids ran at the mere mention of "eggplant" so they didn't really give it a fair shake.  I made it a second time and because I forgot to buy ricotta cheese, had to substitute cottage cheese instead and we agreed we liked it even better that way.  Reheats well.

Delicious recipe!  I made it for my boyfriend and he had 2 helpings at dinner and then took the rest for lunch the next day....I cooked it again later that week and it was just as yummy.  I used Barilla lasagna and casserole sauce.  I suggest using a nonstick pan to cook the eggplant and add oil a little at a time because the eggplant soaks up oil fast and if you put it all in at once then the first batch of eggplant will soak it all up.

I won't make it again. It is more like a lasagne, using egglplant for noodles.
 Also, I couldn't get all the salt off. I rinsed, but obviously not well enough. For someone who seldom salts food, this was way too salty.

Delicious. If you actually cut the eggplant in 3/4" slices as instructed, you'd be lucky to cover the bottom of the 9x13 pan and definitely wouldn't have enough for a second layer. I cut mine in ~1/2" slices, and had just over one layer. Next time I will get two medium eggplants. Why not make it a little healthier by adding more vegetables relative to cheese?

I rarely look forward to leftovers but I did with this dish.  It was wonderful!  I didn't have ricotta, but I just substituted sour cream.  A note about the olive oil, don't keep adding more.  The amount for the recipe is sufficient.  If you keep adding more you are going to end up with very oily eggplant.  Mine was fine, but I know from prior experience.

I will definitely try this recipe again. As it was a last minute decision I did not have the cheese on hand and substituted with goat cheese and cheddar. Also the pasta sauce contained basil but I didn't have fresh basil on hand.  However it was still delicious so I imagine next time with the correct ingredients will be even better. Also as per some comments I also dipped the eggplant in egg and then breadcrumbs.  Only negative is that that it uses alot of oil for frying

I thought the recipe was delicious, however next time I would add more eggplant, I felt that it got lost in all the sauce and cheese.  I also breaded the eggplant in Italian breadcrumbs to add some flavor and some crunch which turned out well. I was worried that the dish wouldn't have enough substance to it because it looked like there wasn't enough eggplant so at the last minute I decided to boil some spaghetti and I served the eggplant parmesan over it and it was delicious.

LOVED this.  Even though it's a lot of work, it's fantastic for when eggplant is finally in season.  Watch out for spatters when you're frying it up!

Delicious delicious! This was very easy and my friends loved it. I didn't have ricotta cheese at hand so I substituted with extra soft tofu and no one realized until I said anything. I wish I had leftovers.

This was awesome! I have never cooked eggplant before and was very nervous cooking this for my Italian husband (who cooks very well) lol ... But this was a hit! I am totally making this hopefully one a week. The only thing I did differently, was I added more ricotta & mozzarella cheese than stated. (We are cheese lovers here) Thankyou!

I come from a very traditional, food-loving Italian family and this recipe went over very well at my grandfather's birthday party.  In order to prevent the eggplant from soaking up the olive oil, I skipped the sweating step and instead soaked the eggplant slices in a bowl of water for about 20 minutes.  We love ricotta cheese, so the incorporation of that into this recipe won it many points.  I also like that this recipe doesn't call for a batter of any kind.

Heavenly! My hubby and I adore this dish. The only thing I do different is to omit the ricotta and add more mozzarella instead, but that's just a personal preference for me. This has become a regular recipe made in my house.

This  is an outstanding recipe.  I doubled it though and still cooked it in a 13 x 9 pan for 40 minutes.  Every flavor is distinct and absolutely compliment one another.  I kept the measurements exact and would not add a thing.  I used bottled classico marinara with burgundy.

I made this tonight for my family. Even though I like eggplant, I didn't care for the way this dish came together. My husband and I said it was okay. Our kids were a definite no. I love the cheese mixture and will use the cheese mixture in other dishes. All in all, I will make this again and try different other reviewers ideas. Thank you for posting.

I have to say, there are a couple of problems with this recipe as is. First off, I ended up using four eggplants, intead of one. I would have only been able to complete one, maybe two layers with one eggplant. Next, the recipe calls for WAY to much basil. I used 1/4 of what was called for, and I still felt like it was too much. Finally, I left the eggplant "sweat" for more than 3 hours, and I still think it could have used longer. The end result was fair, and it did take a rather long time to brown the eggplant, and assemble the dish.

I love this recipe.  FAR better than breaded and fried eggplant.  And so much easier.  The fresh basil is great, but I'm sure it would be delish with dried basil, too.  My eggplant made one layer and I used sliced mushrooms for a second layer.  I only needed 24 oz of pasta sauce.

My husband is used to authentic Italian cooking via my mother in law. This was perfect comfort food since his family lives so far away from us. I didn't like the eggplant baked fresh from the oven...like some reviewers did...but once it is baked, you can't tell the difference from fried. Completely delicious! Thanks for posting!

i've been wanting to make this for my girlfriend and we talked about it after the first few bites - too much basil.  I also breaded the eggplant before I pan fried it.  The mixture had organic breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper and a bit of dried basil.  The cheese mixture was awesome other than all the basil!  Gonna do half of that next time and add a few other spices in there.

1 Eggplant was  not enough so 2-8in long by 5in round at bottom should be enough for at least 2 layers. Other than that it was good! Thank you for sharing.

Wasn't the best - but okay.  Lots of sauce.  Not enough eggplant.

I thought this was delicious!  But I have to agree with the other reviewers that thought that this was more like an eggplant lasagna than eggplant parmesan.  You really loose out on the "parmesan" part when you don't bread and fry the eggplant, but this method is a little healthier.  I also thought that you needed to double the amount of eggplant or lessen the amount of cheese.  We did make this and then serve it over spaghetti noodles, and make our sauce with italian sausage.  Delish!

Too cheesy!  The cheese mixture overtook the eggplant.  This recipe is more like eggplant lasagna.  Not at all what I was looking for.

Thank you for this wonderful  and easy recipe, we LOVED it!  The only things that could have made it better is if 1) More eggplant since I used an entire 14 oz tub of ricotta cheese 2) my homemade marina sauce.  Leftovers were great and we wished we'd had more.

Very good recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to bread the eggplant slices, and I put a little extra shredded mozzarella on the top.  This was my first attempt at eggplant parmesan, and I would definitely make it again.

eazy to make. Taste good. I used fresh basil leaves from my plant. Peel the eggplant it's less tough. Also the smaller the eggplant the less seeds.

It was a great experience creating this dish for the first time.  The only thing I did different was to dip in egg and coat with Italian bread crumbs then layered in dish.  Great!

I thought this was a very good recipe but I chose to dip the eggplant in egg then bread crumbs then fry it. I used non stick spray and a just a bit of olive oil because eggplant sucks up the oil rather quickly. I would definitely make this again.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe. Instead of sweating the eggplants I fried them: first I seasoned flour, placed the eggplants in the flour, tapped off excess flour off, placed the eggplants in eggs, and dredged the eggplant in seasoned bread crumbs and the fried them and then followed the rest of the recipe.

This was an excellent basic recipe.  I did the dip in milk and then flour thing before frying the eggplant slices and think that added to the texture without masking the flavor of the eggplant. I agree with other reviewers that the ricotta was a winning touch!  Thanks for such a simple recipe. Some eggplant parmesan recipes are rather intimidating.

Fantastic recipe. I used homemade marinara sauce and had to use Turkish cheese substitutes as follows: kasar/mozzarella, lor/ricotta, and mahilic/parm since I'm currently living overseas. My husband doesn't like eggplant at all so it was huge when he declared that he LOVED it! Will make this over and over again. Thank you for the recipe!

I used cottage cheese instead of Ricotta - that is what I had on hand. I roasted the sliced eggplant in the oven to save the extra fat and calories from frying it. This was OK but I prefer the traditional eggplant parmesan. This one tasted like an eggplant lasagna....

I used fat free ricotta and a diet mozzarella.  I sauteed the eggplant in a non stick skillet.  I'm not sure how much that dropped the caloric content given how much cheese is in it, but it didn't affect the flavor at all.  This was delicious!

First of all, fun and relatively easy eggplant recipe, very delicious. I didn't catch the part about *shredded* mozarella and instead cut a block of moz into little chunks, which to my surprise made the dish more interesting and delicious. A homemade sauce makes this dish doubly good, a simple crushed blanched roma tomatoes basil sugar salt and sauteed onions and garlic worked for me, Recipes are so fun! Big hit with the family, my dog liked the leftover eggplant (I bought two). Very much recommended!

I like this recipe because you don't bread the eggplant before you fry it. I used a jar of chunky mushroom sauce and added a little more than the recipe called for. This way I had more sauce when I served it over spaghetti. So Good!

Although I think the basic concept of this recipe is good, there are some flaws with the measurements.  I made this tonight, and made some adjustments based on some of the reviews I read, so maybe that was part of the problem, though I don't think so.  I baked the eggplant rather than fried it because I didn't want a lot of extra calories from the absorbed oil. The recipe called for one eggplant, but since the ones I had were small, I used two.  Then there wasn't enough to make 2 complete layers in a 9"X13" pan, so I had just a partial layer.  The ricotta/cheese filling is delicious, particularly with fresh basil from our garden.  I baked it 30 minutes and wasn't able to cut through the eggplant; cooked it another 10 and it still didn't seem right so I took off the top layer and cooked it yet another 10.  It was edible and flavorful, but not destined to become a tried-and-true staple of my household.  It was too problematic. I want a more reliable recipe that I don't have to troubleshoot but can instead gently adjust and perfect each time.

I tried this last night as a "test run" dish for my Bunco group get together.  One of us is vegetarian, one of us is not eating white flour and sugar, etc...  Anyway, this recipe was very good and will fit the criteria for most diets and eating plans.  I will make it again and again.

This was a very good recipe.  The only change I made was to use less sauce.  I only used about 1 cup of sauce total.  I can't imagine using 4 cups of sauce for this recipe.  It just seems like it would be too much.  My husband and I don't like a lot of sauce though so it's really just our personal preference.  We will be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good flavor and very easy to make. Like that it is lower carb due to not breading or flouring the eggplant, but something was missing although I cannot put my finger on exactly what it is.

I'm not sure I should rate this recipe since I made so many changes...  To make this healthier, I used fat free cottage cheese, fat free mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 less fat Parmesan cheese.  You'd never even know that it was low fat.  I also added spinach and mushrooms.  Yum!

This was quite good. I prefer a firmer eggplant so I did not salt and bleed beforehand. I ended up needing 2 large eggs not just one. Next time I plan egg the eggplant before browning :) but my family and I truly prefer this no bread style, it was a yummy pasta free eggplant lasangna :)

My first attempt at this dish was a success!  I added a packet of Boboli pizza sauce to the a small jar of Prego and omitted the ricotta (I'm not a fan).  I left the tops without sauce and it was crispy on the edges and tender on the inside.  Yum!

Very good! I loved how the eggplant and cheese took on a lasagna form. I did bread and fry my eggplant first and I think I would skip the breading next time because it came out a bit greasy. I also salted the eggplant slices and let them sit for 30 mins to sweat. There was no bitterness after. I served this with salad, pasta and meatballs. Great comfort-food recipe!

I was so nervous to make this as I have never attempted a dish quite like this one. So, I kind of made it up as I went along. While I was preparing other ingredients I simply stacked in one layer the eggplant slices between layers of paper towels. Then when it came time to cook them I dipped them in egg and coated with Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and cooked in a lot of olive oil and again sandwiched them between paper towels. I needed more sauce then what was called for but then again I was kind of making it up as I went along. This was a surprise dinner for my dad and he and the whole family included loved it, not bad for my first time! Thanks so much for making this scary dish sooo easy!!! DO serve with garlic bread and a salad..

I thought the cheese mixture was fantastic, but the proportions on the recipe were a bit off - way too much sauce and not enough eggplant.

I really like this recipe, although I do not follow the measurements at all. As I am just cooking for my husband and myself, I just use one eggplant, and I do salt the eggplant before baking it. Then let it soak for about 10 minutes, as suggested by other users. When its ready to bake in the sauce, I pour a about one can of sauce in the bottom of my 9x13, and dump a load of cheese on it. I really only bake until the cheese is melted. The first time I made it I let it go the full half hour and burnt the cheese.
I serve with angel hair pasta topped with the Easy Alfredo Sauce recipe. Really rich, really good.

My husband and I had this for dinner this evening and found this meal only "okay".  The reviews made me excited to try this out and I took the advice of some and increased the cheese mixture by 1.5.  We thought this was too much cheese. I will probably go back to the traditional eggplant parmasean.  Thank you for those suggesting to use non-stick cooking spray to cook the eggplant.

This was great.  I started off doubling the ingredients because I had extra eggplant and ricotta to make 2 casseroles  but come to find that I needed both eggplants for 2 layers in a 9x13 pan.  I used all ingredients and topped it off with 4 no cook lasagne noodles covered in sauce.Covered and baked for over an hour to get the center to temp.  But it tasted great! I also broiled the eggplant slices sprayed with a little oil.

This recipe has a good base idea however it certainly needs a few tweeks. The eggplant slices need to be increased (I used two mid sized eggplant) and  breaded before frying. I will also either incorperate laz noodles or serve over some type of pasta!

The cheese mixture is great, as the others said you could add more eggplant and take out a bit of sauce.  Eventhough i prefer no breading, this recipe felt like it would have been great breaded but just mediocre not breaded...

I really enjoyed this recipe. Delicious. The only thing I would change about it is it has way too much basil. I really thought that wasn't possible, since I adore basil, but it really was in this case. Maybe because I grow my own basil and it has a better, stronger flavour? I don't know. It overpowers the delicate flavor of the eggplant. 1/2 cup sure is a lot and I had to cut nice size stalks of several plants. I didn't have ricotta so used cottage cheese. Also WAY too much olive oil for the calorie concsious. Instead of adding to the pan, I only used about 2-3 tablespoons, and instead brushed the oil on both sides of the eggplant, then fried it. Perfect!

This was terrific! I cooked the eggplant until tender in a non-stick frying pan with no oil; just added some water occasionally for almost a sautee' effect and used reduced fat mozarella and 1% fat ricotta cheese. You couldn't tell the difference!  I made my own sauce using Homemade Tomato Sauce II from this website and modified a little, using less water and adding some red wine and crushed red pepper.  I was VERY happy with the way this turned out and will definitely make it again. (Also, I made the sauce the night ahead so it would be more flavorful the next day, and layered the dish and refrigerated it in the morning so that all I had to do was bake it 45 minutes before dinner that night.)

This was so awesome. I added extra of all 3 of the cheeses. I also added some chopped garlic in the skillet when browning the eggplant to add a garliky flavor. My stomach growls just thinking about it! Tastes even better the next day!

This was delicious, much like a vegetarian lasagna. I followed FOXYLOXY's advice and used the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe from this site (another great recipe!) and used freshly picked young eggplant, so I didn't salt the slices before cooking. It was excellent, and I didn't miss the breading; in fact, it seemed much lighter without it. Great recipe!

Overall this was pretty good.  I browned the eggplant slices (unpeeled, and skipped the salt step) in a tiny bit of olive oil in a non-stick pan.   Next time I'll make the slices thinner and lightly coat in bread crumbs before browning.  This is better the second day.  Thanks.

Great! My first time eating, or making Eggplant Parmesan and it turned out wonderful. Like the recipe says, it's a great meal with some garlic bread and a salad. Even apprehensive Eggplant avoiders will give it a try, since it looks, and smells so wonderful.

This is the best eggplant parmesan recipe I've ever followed. I used Five Brothers Mushroom and Garlic sauce - yummy!  I sliced the eggplant approximately 1/4" - 1/2" thick, but next time I think I will cut the slices in half -- makes it easier to serve that way.  The ricotta was great, but if you're not a big cheese lover, you may find it a bit too heavy.  Also, I think next time I will mix a little bit of sauce in with the cheese mixture to make speading easier.  I like my eggplant piled high, so I used a 8"x8" baking dish.  Overall, it's a great recipe!

This was the best eggplant parmesan I have ever eaten.  The egg added to the cheeses gives it a very light texture.  I use 'Five Brothers' toasted garlic and onion spaghetti sauce.  I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs on the eggplant slices before frying them.  Most excellent!!!!

We loved it!!  We put italian bread crumbs on it before we fried
 it and it turned out wonderful!  We made two dishes, 
one with the tomato sauce and another with
olive oil and garlic.  Both were excellent!!!

This recipe was good.  I made a few changes and it turned out even better! (I breaded the eggplant slices with italian breadcrumbs before frying them and it turned out excellent!)

Delicious! My only complaint is the recipe should've put how many cups instead of ounces. Its 2 cups of Mozzarella and 3/4 of a cup of Ricotta. However, since I've never liked Ricotta I borrowed from another reviewer and used Cottage Cheese. Also from another reviewer I put the slices in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes after first spraying the tray and then the slices, instead of frying. I also left out the egg, I didn't feel like I needed it. It turned out great and I served it with garlic bread.

Good basic recipe. My daughters are not fans of ricotta cheese, but they do like eggplant. I followed recipe, leaving out salting step, and ricotta/egg mixture. Using a mandarin, I sliced 1/2 inch slices of eggplant and sautéed in olive oil (4 minutes on both sides). I layered according to directions using only sauce, eggplant, and cheese. I baked for 20 mins. to melt cheese. Casserole was moist and tasty! I served with Chicken parmesan. Very tasty!

Love this recipe, but I don't really get the name. Its more like Eggplant Lasagna. I skipped the pan fry step and just assembled with the sliced eggplant after rinsing away the salt. Simply add about 15-20 minutes more bake time if skipping the frying step. It turned out wonderful as part of our Thanksgiving meal.

The dish was flavorful but next time I’ll only leave the salted eggplant for 30 min as the recipe calls for. After letting  it soak for 2 hours and rinsing, the dish was good but a lot more saltier than we’re use to.

Best eggplant parm I have ever had and I don't usually like eggplant parm.  I added 3 whole cherry tomatoes to the top of each stack as a garnish and for a taste of fresh tomatoes.  in addition I added more parm and mozzarella then called for to make it extra cheesy.  My wife liked it because eggplant is not breaded before frying and is lighter on the stomach.

After reading a few other reviews decided to add that I browned my eggplant in a well heated cast iron skillet at a little over medium high.  Only had one slice absorb much oil and that was the first piece I put in the skillet before the oil reach maximum temp.  After the oil got hot oil absorption was not a problem and got a nice sear on all the other pieces.

This was way too runny with sauce & cheese.  I used two eggplants and it probably needed at least two more to make up for the other ingredients.  I will look for another recipe.

Have used this recipe many times. The  only adaptation I make is the addition of mozzarella to the parmesan topping (packages in Canada are measured in grams. I used all 320g on top which is about 12 oz)

Made this for a family dinner. Everyone thought it was delicious. It is so easy to make. The first time I made it I did not cook the eggplant on the stovetop so it took a little longer in the oven. The second time I did. Both ways taste great.

Followed everything except I used the oven method rather than frying.  I sprayed an aluminum lined cookie sheet with Pam Olive Oil on bottom of pan, then sprayed very lightly tops of sliced eggplant.  Then baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.

The only change I made was to bake instead of fry the eggplant. I laid it out on a cookie sheet and sprayed it with cooking spray, turned it over and did the same. Popped it into a 425 oven and baked until soft. Otherwise followed the recipe. My husband and I love it and will be eating it again!

Have made this several times.  I like many reviewers find it easier to bake the egg plant slices in the oven.  I prefer 425 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes and I flip them midway.  Also I almost double the cheese mixture.  I can't imagine covering two layers with mixture as it is written.  Maybe I just love cheese too much.  LOL  I serve it up with homemade meatballs, and garlic bread, and a side salad...Yum!

This was my first time making this or doing anything with eggplant. The sauce was amazing, but it turned out I had picked some over-ripe eggplant and it kinda ruined it. I pulled all the eggplant out and will use the sauce for a spaghetti casserole.

I made it per the recipe.  It was pretty good although the ricotta and cheese mixture left the taste and consistency more like lasagna, really  overwhelmed the eggplant.  Next time I'll leave out the ricotta and a little less of the marinara.

This is less an eggplant parmesan and more an eggplant lasagna. Unless you're using monster eggplant you need to use two. I also had to double the cheese recipe because just doing the single batch barely covered one layer. I added garlic powder, dried oregano, and had to use dried basil as I didn't have fresh when I mixed it all in with the cheese. We didn't care for the texture of the eggplant after having fried it in olive oil because of how the eggplant sucked up the oil. I cooked it for 35 minutes in my convection oven, but it could probably have used a little longer. Overall it was an okay recipe, and I'll probably make it again, but I'll either bread the eggplant or I'll forgo the oil to keep the eggplant from becoming too soggy and slimy.

I preferred this over other eggplant parmigiana recipes because you slice and bake instead of breaking and frying the eggplant slices. The prep is easier and faster. I brushed the eggplant with garlic infused olive oil because I had it and sprinkled it with garlic powder. I used store bought garlic and herb red sauce. My daughter and I loved better than any we've had.

2016.11.17 - Changes:  Peeled eggplant, cut eggplant to only 1/2 inch slices, did not sweat eggplant, added salt and pepper while frying eggplant, ended up with only one layer of eggplant.  Used marinara sauce.  Just put a little sauce on top, as there was only one eggplant layer.  Only needed to bake 30 minutes cook time. 
DBF loved it!  I liked it!  The eggplant didn't seem thoroughly cooked, though, so I think that next time I will cut it thinner and fry it until it is a little darker.   Definitely have two jars of marinara sauce ready.  We ate this with radiator pasta.

I had to substitute cottage cheese for ricotta because I didn't have any.  It turned out great!  I will definitely make this again.

It wasn't bad.  It would have been better if the eggplant had been breaded - but overall fairly average.  I think I'll try the rollatini recipes next time where the eggplant is rolled around the ricotta mixture - I think it would work better.

Added in some cheddar and mozzarella cheeses along with the ricotta and parmesan for my cheese lovers, made a homemade sauce versus the jar of spaghetti sauce,and they loved it! Will definitely be making this again in the future. :)

It was good but mushy.  I think I will try one of the recipes that bread and fry the eggplant or even the one that bakes it first, next time, just to give it a little more firmness.

I most definitely will make again!! I used fresh mozzarella pearls instead of grated mozzarella and mixed with the ricotta (I used 15 oz ricotta) I found an amazing Eggplant and Artichoke Marinara made by Classico that I used and really made the dish special!  I was pleasantly surprised that the eggplant wasn't breaded. I have never eaten or cooked eggplant...and that changes thanks to this yummy recipe!

Good dish but the ingredient qua ties are off.  It calls for one eggplant cut into 3/4" slices fried until browned.  You then make a layer in a 9" X 13" baking dish.  One layer uses up the large eggplant so the whole layering concept is down the drain.  If I ever make it again I'll either double the eggplant or use a smaller dish.  FYI

I certainly will make it again. Expect to use more oil than the recipe calls for when frying the eggplant, although this can be greatly reduced with the use of a non-stick pan. I think the ricotta gives this recipe the classic flavor of Parmesan. In addition to the Parmesan cheese of course.

The end result was good, but the prep took forever & frying the eggplant was SO frustrating. I let my eggplant dry out for well over 3 hours. I really don't understand frying in olive oil. It has such a low smoke point that it smoked up my whole house. The eggplant soaked up all the oil (I had breaded mine). I doubt I'll ever make this again since its so time consuming & while the end result is good, it's not so stellar to justify the frustration.

Made recipe as original with the addition of breadcrumbs before frying eggplant.  Tasted fantastic. I had a little trouble spreading the cheese mixture.  It was sort of cookie-dough texture and not so easy to work with.  Also raised baking temperature to 400 last 10 minutes to soften eggplant.  Combination of flavors was A+!

I enjoyed this recipe. It also works if you lightly spray the eggplant slices after preparing as directed and grill them until tender. Then prepare and bake as directed.
 This is  healthier and tastes great! I also have used  half part skim ricotta  and half low fat or non-fat cottage cheese .
You won't miss the fat and it tastes wonderful! Use part skim mozzarella as well!

I followed the recipe except for a couple of minor changes.I didn't have any basil  so I  used a little bit of oregano.  Also, I mixed a little bit of Italian bread crumbs in with the cheese.

Good if you are watching carbs, but I think I prefer it with breading, especially as it adds seasoning.  I tried frying them without doing the salt step, as the top comment recommended. They still soaked up all the oil, so I'm not sure that advice helps any.

Made it a couple of times now and I must say it is by far better than any other recipe. I feel the ricotta cheese is the difference in my tastes. Mmmmm it's so good!!!

We loved this, maybe next time I'll cut back on the ricotta just a bit. I breaded the eggplant in seasoned bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese before layering everything together.

I changed it up a little.  Didn't fry the eggplant and didn't use regatta.  It was wonderful!

I thought this tasted great and wasn't too difficult to prepare - I coated the eggplant with panko breadcrumbs because I wanted to! :)

My family loved this recipe! I did make a couple of changes, I roasted the eggplant in the oven at 400°F for 20 minutes as someone else suggested to make a bit healthier, just sprayed each side with olive oil cooking spray.  I added some mozarella cheese along with the parmesan on top, because we all love cheese.  We didn't have a bit of leftover, just guys complaining that they ate way too much! ;)

A delicious way to use the abundant summer eggplant!  This recipe seems to be pretty flexible with amounts and substitutions of everything.  I think I used more eggplant than called for, used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, colby jack instead of mozzarella, and added an additional egg.  Substitutions were because of what I had on hand.

Yummy!  I roasted the eggplant in the oven, as previous reviewers suggested.  I used on jar of pasta sauce, and added just a little more ricotta cheese and mozzarella.  The fresh basil gives it a wonderful flavor.  It is definitely more like lasagna, but who cares when it is this good?

We planted eggplant this year and I wondered what to do with them. This recipe has become a family favorite. My husband (the vegetarian) raved about it and my daughter (the picky one) even had seconds!

My husband and I made this dish tonight and followed the recipe almost exactly. The only changes we made were to buy more than one eggplant (good decision one would have not been enough) and to use more than 8 0z of Ricotta. When we spread it in the dish it did not cover enough. However, if I was to do this recipe again I might try a few different things as I didn't think this was the best I have ever had or anything. We tried to be healthy and not bread fry the eggplant but I think next time we would.  Also next time I might try using half ricotta and half cottage cheese. All and all a good recipe but I think I might try these suggestions I have made or maybe find a different recipe next time.

I thought this recipe was YUMMY! I baked the eggplant instead of frying it and added sliced vine ripened tomatoes as an additional layer. I also didn't add the egg to the cheese mixture and dolloped the mixture as someone else had suggested. I sprinkled the top with more mozz and parm and cooked until it was brown and bubbly!

I am not much of an eggplant eater.  My husband thought this was good.  A friend gave me a few from her garden and I did not want them to go to waste.  The eggplants were small (3).  I did do the sweating process then I roasted the slice eggplants as others suggested.  I did not have enough eggplant to layer as the directions stated. If I  make this again I will make sure I have enough Eggplants.

Loved this recipe!!  I used homemade sauce with red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I also added balsamic vinegar while browning the eggplant in the oil.  Lastly I did not have ricotta cheese, so I just left it out... The meal still tasted great!!  This was my new years dinner for my husband!

Made the recipe almost exactly per the printed recipe, and everyone loved it. Very nice way to enjoy eggplant parmesan with a lot less fat (from breading, etc.)  Careful with the pre-frying of the eggplant -- it will soak up olive oil like a sponge!  Overall, very good!

I just finished eating, this recipe is extremely good.  The only complaint is that the eggplant does suck up a lot of oil when browning it.  The reason why I chose this recipe over the over one is that its not breaded and fried but this ended up using a lot of oil either way.  I will definitely attempt this again, maybe with Pam spray next time to lower calories.

My family loved this (and that includes a 4 year old picky eater!).  The only thing I did differently was fried the eggplant in the skillet sprayed with Olive Oil Pam instead of straight olive oil.  It turned out great! Will definitely make this again!

Excellent! The ricotta is what actually won we over and made me make it. My neighbor had graciously given me a bunch of eggplants from her garden and I couldn't let them go to waste. This is my first time making eggplant parm and it was a great success. Everyone loved it, my neighbor included, last night she asked if I wanted more eggplants to take. The only thing I did differently was that I added bread crumbs to the cheese mixture which makes it nice and clumpy which melts gooey and delicious in the oven. I also used two different flavors of sauces and of course fresh basil was definitely key. Thanks for sharing! :)

Excellent.  It was a success with my family and friends.  Tasted like lasagna. Used one large eggplant and fresh basil.  Also used my own tomato sauce instead of jar sauce.  My friend wanted recipe, but said it was my own sauce that made it special.  It was superb.  Will make it again and again.  A must keep recipe.

I do not eat cheese so I used this recipe as a base for how to make eggplant and WOW! It was great. I have made this twice already in the last two weeks. Thank you!

Wonderful recipe, my first experience with cooking eggplant.  I did slice the eggplant a little thinner, thought 3/4 of a inch was just too thick and replace the ricotta with cottage cheese.  My mother-in-law asked for recipe because it was better than hers and she's old country Italiano.

My Husband tries to eat Low Carb when possible, so this was perfect for him! He loved it! I let the eggplant sweat for 3hours. I also added turkey sausage to the sauce. I will be making this again!

I make this one so often I have it memorized. It's a special treat for us, and the recipe is perfect as written. If you realize you are out of egg, substitute baking powder and water.

Good basic starter recipe for people to add or delete to their tastes. Used cottage cheese, don't care for the texture of ricotta. Added cooked linguine noodles, layered on top of sauce, a little more sauce then eggplant.
I dipped eggplant in egg then Italian bread crumbs. Tried baking them, decided frying them in olive oil is the better way. So, 1/2 were baked 1/2 were fried.

Messy but delicious!  Was looking for a good vegetarian recipe to bring to Ronald McDonald house, and this was a real hit!  Like a lasagna without the pasta.  It didn't look pretty, but the taste more than made up for it!

I added fried chicken cutlets on the bottom and them had two layers of eggplants slices.  I also used fresh basil, mozzarella, parmesan and skim ricotta.  Added oregano, a tad of garlic and some dried Italian parsley.   

It is a good basic recipe that allows one to play with the ingredients to taste.  I did sweat the eggplant and used PAM spray olive oil to fry it until very brown.

I love this recipe; it's probably my very favorite from this site. I have not yet had an eggplant parmesan at a restaurant that could beat this. The only change I make is to use a little extra mozzarella. Fantastic!

This was great all my roommates and friends loved it. I had to sub. Montery Jack instead of Mozzerella but Im sure the taste would be very similar. I also forgoed the eggplant sweating part. I found it best just to VERY LIGHTLY brown the eggplant. They also turned a beautiful color of green with the olive oil. Great recipe, I doubled the recipe as well.

Delicious, filling and rich. I used feta and a splash of milk instead of ricotta as for some reason I could not find it in the shops. I also added a layer of lightly fried spinach and fresh tomatoes in chilli flakes. This is a brilliant recipe to make for my veggie friends.

This recipe is not what I expected. I think the ricotta mixture ruined it and baking the eggplant instead of pan-frying them made it chewy. Next time I think I'll stick with the classic recipes instead.

This was my first time making eggplant parmesan, and it went pretty well.  I played kind of fast and loose with the measurements and added some garlic to the cheese mixture.  I served it over angel hair pasta tossed with pesto.  It wasn't the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was definitetly tasty and we're looking forward to having the leftovers this week. I'd make it again.

This was sooo yummy! Followed recipe as directed, except I added 3 provolone slices to the top of the casserole and then sprinkled the romano/parmesan on top to make it extra cheesy. Some Italian seasoning also added a little extra flavor. Thank you Karen for this wonderful recipe!

A++++++++  I loved this recipe.  Everytime I cooked eggplant in the past, it always turned out underdone and the dish was watery. This came out perfect.  I didn't use oil for browning the eggplant, I just used pam.  And in the ricotta mixture I followed another reviewers advice and didn't add the other cheeses in with it, added garlic and basil.  I used egg beaters, 33% less fat cheese and made my own pasta sauce.  I also used lots of fresh garlic.  This was the best. My family raved, and said it tasted a lot like lasanga. I will make this again!!!

Well, I don't know what to say....I made it for dinner one night and neither my boyfriend or I liked it. However, it was my first time working with eggplant at home, so I might have just done something wrong! I'll probably keep looking for another recipe.

YUM!!! My husband is a VERY picky eater and wasn't thrilled when I told him this was what we were having for dinner; However, after taking his first bite, he quickly took back his words, as he was very impressed with the outcome of this recipe. The only change that I would make to it, would be to add more eggplant, because I felt it didn't have enough and therefore had way too much sauce.

Wow,
My husband made this dish as we are doing modified low-carb as a lifestyle change and are losing inches and weight.  The eggplant is such a beautiful veggie but I think we were scared of it.  We had never tried it before (we like Italian) and decided to use this wonderful recipe.  It was delicious.  Thank you.  Debbie

I followed this recipe pretty much to the letter except for a couple of changes I made based on reading other reviews. 1) I peeled the eggplant first., 2) I dipped the eggplant in egg and dredged in seasoned bread crumbs and then deep fried them in my fryer for about 2-3 minutes. 

This was my first attempt at eating eggplant and I was pleasantly surprised because I didnt think I would like it at all. 

It wasn't awesome, it isn't something I'd want to eat weekly but it was good. Granted I changed the recipe some so I think next time I will leave out the breading and see what happens. 

Personally I like zucchini lasagna better than eggplant though. (I just recently tried zucchini for the first time and liked it).

I've never had success with Eggplant Parmesan until this one!  Just as tasty and filling as I remember eating in a little Italian restaurant over 40 years ago in Nashville, TN.  It's gone now but the taste and memory linger!  Thank you.

WOW!!!  Easy to make,easy to love! This was the first time I've ever prepared eggplant. I dipped the eggplant slices in egg and then in bread crumbs, and it turned out great.  I served this with Chicken Parmesan (which I make often) and it was a wonderful change.

yummy.  thought i didn't like eggplant, guess i was wrong.  i used a mister to mist olive oil into my skillet.  i don't think that my eggplant was too greasy because of that.  overall this was a hit with my family and will definetly be repeated.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I'm not a vegetarian, but am trying to cut down on meat so I thought I'd give this one a try.  It takes some time, but it's really easy to make.  This one's definitely a keeper!

My first attempt at making eggplant and it was very tasty.  Next time I will leave out the ricotta cheese.  Although I love ricotta cheese, I think it made this dish too heavy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Thanks Karen for this wonderful recipe.  For the sauce I used the recipe "Best Marinara Sauce Yet," that I found in the pasta section.  A bit more work, but well worth the effort.  Also one of the things that I liked about this recipe was that it did not use bread crumbs on the eggplant.  So very fresh and delicious!
