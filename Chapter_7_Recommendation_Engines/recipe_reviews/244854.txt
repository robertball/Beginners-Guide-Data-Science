My family went crazy over this recipe even the finicky eaters! Cutting the oil ans butter in half did not affect the taste at all just the amount of fat and carbs This has become a family favorite!

Very easy and tasty with a few changes. First I need to mention this recipe isn't enough for 4 servings it is enough for 2. I added Italian seasoning since another reviewer mentioned it needed more flavor. I cooked the chicken while cooking the garlic mushrooms in a different pan. I added a drained can of diced garlic basil oregano tomatoes and included the spinach last. My husband's plate had the chicken mine was without.

Perfect for those busy nights this recipe is fast and easy and fresh tasting and healthy. The only change I would make is to add more spinach the next time.
