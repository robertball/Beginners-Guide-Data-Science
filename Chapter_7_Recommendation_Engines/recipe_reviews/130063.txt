I have made a parmesan chicken for many years, this was a very  very good recipe and an easy sauce (something I never thought to add before).  Family of 8 loved this and have already begged for this again soon.

This chicken turned out AWESOME. My boyfriend loved it, I loved it. I didnt' end up making the sauce though. But really the chicken didn't even need it. I served it w/homemade 5 cheese mac & cheese. It was a delicious meal, and I will definately make chicken this way again.

For taste, 5 out of 5 for sure!  I'm not a great cook [yet, haha] so the directions were a bit ambiguous for me. I like recipes to hold my hand. :) I also noticed that when I flipped the chicken in the pan a bit of the breading came off, so I used more oil [I used vegetable oil, by the way- something it never specifically mentioned].  One thing that I couldn't get to work was the sauce- for some reason my sauce was quite runny [and a little lumpy as the 'cream cheese' didn't want to melt or mix. Either way- runny or not it was absolutely delicious flavor.  My husband adored everything about this chicken and I cannot wait to cook it again for him!

Ate this up!  The sauce is so easy and makes it divine.  How can it be bad with cream cheese?

wonderful flavor. I was short on the sauce. I would double the ingredients making it 2/3 green onion cream cheese and 6-8 oz. chicken broth.
