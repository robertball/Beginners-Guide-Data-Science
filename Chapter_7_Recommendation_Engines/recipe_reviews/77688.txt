I'm not sure I'd call this delicious. Sauteing the carrots led to a more fibrous consistency than perhaps steaming or boiling them would have. The soy milk, maple syrup and 5-spice powder made for an odd sweetness that I found myself eating but not sure how much I was enjoying. Maybe it would be better with curry powder instead of 5-spice.

A wonderful spread for sandwiches. I did end up switching the 5 spice for curry powder the second time I made it, though.

Delicious! Don't let the kitchen sink approach scare you off, this is a great recipe. I follow it exactly and even those who seemed unsure given the ingredients loved it once they tried it. I like to serve it in a bread bowl
