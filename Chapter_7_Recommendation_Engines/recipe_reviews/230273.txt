Great recipe, very inventive to butterfly the pork loin and stuff with stuffing, I used Stovetop stuffing and wrapped in bacon and roasted it in the oven, a little dry, but I think next time I will cook a little less than 21/2 hours, thanks!

This recipe is a winner. I substituted the bread stuffing for brown rice and it was delicious.

This is a super simple recipe that presents beautifully.  I, too, used boxed stuffing mix for pork along with the veggies in the recipe. Because I had a larger, whole pork loin I added slightly less water than stuffing called for and used a package of frozen, thawed spinach (squeezed dry) for added color/texture/bulk.

In my experience, it's good to butterfly or split the roast on the "fat" side and after tying it with kitchen twine cook it with the fat side up.  This infuses the roast with its own flavor/juices and there's no need to wrap in bacon to have a tender, moist roast.  If your loin is very lean without natural fat the bacon may help, but decrease the salt you'd normally use.

Great recipe. I used boxed stuffing. I also changed the temperature. I cooked it for 15 min. at 450 and then turned down the temperature to 350 for about an hour, checking the temperature with a thermometer. Mine had a nice layer of fat on one side which kept it nice and moist.

It was delicious! For a bit of moisture, I added about 1/2 can of beer to the roasting pan. Made nice juice for topping each serving. 
Remind yourself to get some kite string or kitchen twine to tie up the roast. I forgot and used a doubled string of white cotton quilting thread which worked but was a bit more difficult than using proper string. worked!

Smells heavenly cooking & tastes just a good. I have made this recipe several times and it is such a winner that I had to give it a review.  I, also, put a few strips of bacon on the loin before putting it in the oven.
Tip:  watch your thermometer closely, cooking time can be less than 2 1/2 hours!!

Great recipe. I  wanted to wrap mine in bacon but ended up just adding bacon bits to the stuffing. Still delicious!

Very good.  Moist and tender.  Stuff with whatever you like but don't forget to add the complimentary herbs and/or spices to the outside before cooking.

It was great!  Used boxed stuffing, added 5 links of pre- fried sausage that I cut into chunks and added to stuffing mix which I had made with chicken broth.  Cooked until 160 F.  It was perfectly moist.

Wonderful recipe. Would make again. I made a balsamic glaze to top it with and my son and husband loved it. Also paired well with a mushroom risotto I made with the left over mushrooms.

It was simple, but lacks a lot of flavor. This could benefit from some chorizo or something to up the flavor and complexity of the stuffing. I'm trying another pork loin today so will use this as a base.

Good recipe although a bit dry, maybe because I used one-half a pork loin roast. I'll try it again and check the temperature at 2 hours.

This had a nice flavor and my family really enjoyed it.  The pork was moist.  Good for 3 big hungry men in our house!
