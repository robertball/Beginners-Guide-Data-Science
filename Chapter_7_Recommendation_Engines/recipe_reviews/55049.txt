There was a mistake with this recipe. It should've read Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. This was submitted correctly, so it was NOT the fault of mine.

I had cut the recipe down to fit a 10x10 square pan.  I found it only took 25 minutes to bake then.  This tasted drier then I expected it to be, so first I put catsup on to eat it, didn't like that, so used maple syrup and that made it better.  I would not make it again.  Way too much fat in this recipe.

A little dry but great flavor- i added tomatoes and mushrooms and had to also add an egg with an extra 1/2 c. of "baking mix" to make enough mixture to cover the top.

I add at least 1 cup whipping cream for richness and moisture.

This is the best egg-bake I have ever made! It was so light and fluffy when it came out of the oven! The only thing I changed was I added 2 more cups of crushed corn flakes, with 3/4 cup melted butter, it just gave it a little more crunch on top!!  It was a huge hit with my family!

This is pretty good, and pretty easy, but I have to agree with the comments that there is a bit too little liquid.  I adjusted this to make it more like a quiche because I didn't have all the meat and cheese called for--just had crumbled bacon and American Cheese, so I wouldn't have had enough to do this as written with the mix poured on top.  However, having said that, I think it would work well with sliced cooked bacon lining the dish as well--I might try that next time, as that is something I'm more likely to have in the house as opposed to all those meats and cheeses.  I added another egg and about a 1/2 cup water, then mixed everything together.  I did add frozen chopped spinach to the mixture and it baked up well--needed about 10 extra minutes to cook totally.  It was eaten at a breakfast I brought it to, but it did take longer to disappear than the other casserole I brought.  To be fair, we did have a lot of other food and maybe I scared people with the spinach.  ;)  Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely missing a liquid ingredient--egg/bisquick mix doesn't pour; it's too thick so just sits on top of the other ingredients, and yes, you do need a smaller pan if you want the unexpected biscuit topping to cover all

I tried this and thought it was too dry. I wonder if one of the liquid ingredients was left out.
It also cooked in about 25 minutes.
