Fantastic and easy.  Here's how I pulled off a fantastic white wine sauce using this recipe (my first white wine sauce and huge hit with my hubby):  When the butter was melted, I added one XL clove of garlic, minced, and as soon as the first bit started to turn golden, I added 12oz, of fresh mushrooms, quartered (instead of the jarred/canned kind).  I skipped the salt altogether, as well as the flour.  I made 3/4 cup of broth with 1/2 a veggie bullion cube (this was weak broth, according to the bullion cube's directions) and combined that with a whole cup of white wine (double what the recipe calls for - and I added even more later).  I added the broth/wine mix to the butter/shrooms/garlic mix and kept heating it until it almost simmered.  Then came 1/2 can of evaporated milk (instead of the heavy cream, which is expensive).  I added a boatload of basil, parsley, and cracked black pepper, too, and two shakes of onion powder (instead of "Italian seasoning").  Then I took OUT about 1/2 cup of the liquid and set it aside in a small bowl.  Into that bowl I added almost 2tbsp. of cornstarch, and 
I mixed it in until there were no lumps.  Then of course the contents of that bowl went back into the sauce, and at this point I added a little sea salt to taste (certainly not a whole teaspoon!), more pepper, and a whole other cup of wine (what's the point of wine sauce if you can't taste the wine because you've cooked it all out?!).  I omitted the egg altogether (because many reviewers

Really good!  Left out the egg and shrooms; made it w/lowfat marg. and evap. milk and added 1T of lemon juice after it had simmered.  Am going to make this for a cooking demo using the full fat ingredients.  Served this with boneless; skinless chicken cooked first; and then I made the sauce in the same pan.  YUM!

I made this yesterday and it is a very good tasting sauce, easy and quick too. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and a small can of black olives for my daughter that loves olives. My daughter that doesn't like mushrooms or olives picked hers out (she does that with everything) but she really liked the flavor of the sauce.  I served it mixed in with fusilli pasta and garnished with fresh chopped seeded tomato and fresh chopped basil for eye appeal. One thing I didn't like was the egg mixed in, it didn't taste bad or anything, I just didn't like the way the egg white looked in the sauce, but you couldn't see it once the sauce was mixed with the pasta.  Next time I plan to omit the egg and add a little extra flour instead. I also think this sauce would be excellent with capers instead of or in addition to the mushrooms.   There were no left overs, thanks for the recipe.

My only complaint is that no one warned me I should make a double recipe!  We cleaned the pan with a rubber spatula trying to satisfy our appetite for this delicious sauce!!!  I can't communicate how tasty this was!  Make it tonight, you won't be disappointed!  
Note: I omitted the egg.  No need for the egg, anyway, I can't imagine this tasting any more delectible than it did without it.  I served poured over a bed of linguine with chicken breasts.

This was delicious!  I made it with breaded chicken breasts and it turned out great.  I used fresh mushrooms and added garlic powder and a little extra salt and pepper.  Everyone who tried it reqested the recipe. Thanks!

I left out the egg and most of the butter, and used sour cream instead of heavy cream. Extremely yummy!  This is a very flexible recipe.

Mmmm, delicious! I didn't put the egg in since it didn't look like it was needed based on the other reviews. I found this sauce delicious! All of the ingredients combined together to make a great flavor. I will definitely make this again. It was very easy to make. I added it to chicken and rice and loved that the rice soaked it up. I highly recommend it!

I have been looking for a good sauce recipe and almost gave up! I LOVED this sauce and so did my husband. It was really really good. I only put 1/4 cup of white wine because we don't like our food to have such a wine taste. and it was really good. Thank you! I will make this a lot!

This was just ok. I would keep it as an absolute emergency recipe, with a few changes: add 1 tsp. garlic powder, omit the salt and egg, increase the cream and use less wine. It was quite salty with the chicken broth. :o(

This is a really yummy sauce.  I made it as is, except for doubling the sauce (because I'm an extra sauce person), adding some minced fresh garlic (because I really like garlic, and who doesn't?) and using whole milk instead of heavy cream (because that's what I had).  I'm sure the cream would have given the sauce a much more decadent thickness and flavor.  I ended up boiling the sauce, against recipe advice, because it didn't thicken up enough, which I'm sure was my fault in using whole milk instead of cream.  It worked out great though, by constantly stiring with a wire whisk.  And, I didn't end up with scrambled eggs! I served with shrimp and pasta and was very happy with the result.  This is a keeper!

Use FRESH mushrooms. Such a better flavor. People who avoid mushrooms probably had a bad experience with the jello-like vinegary consistency of jarred mushrooms.... give them a treat to fresh and see if they change their mind!!! It ends up tasting like an excellent winey cream of mushroom- but again so much better than any heated up canned soup mix.

This worked out great.  I did use milk (since that's all that I had) and no egg because I was afraid I wasn't talented enough to avoid the scrambled egg effect.  I added garlic -- as one review suggested -- and nothing else different.  It was terrific over pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this a 5 star because it had simple great ingredients.  I used fresh mushrooms, 1/2tsp of salt, and whole milk.  I did mixed the egg at the end.  The milk and egg give it a creamy taste that helps balances the whole recipe.  Just be very carefull that the heat in really low when adding the egg at the end because it will curd up and that's not what you want.  So just keep mixing and take it off the heat.  I really loved it with some plain pasta.  I will be making this again.  My son who is three just loved it.

I really 'lightened' up this recipe (I'm LIT and can't do any milk products).  I sauteed garlic and onion in a little margarine and olive oil then added parsley and black pepper, 1 cup chicken stock and 2/3 cup wine.  Simmered for about 5 minutes, then added a water/flour combo to thicken.  Poured it over bowtie pasta and fresh steamed broccoli.  The result was two kids asking for thirds and a very happy hubby.  Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe. It's super easy and quick. I have also made it without the egg and it's good that way, too. I add chicken to the sauce while sauteeing the mushrooms and it's always delicious!

This is a quick and easy sauce that I used to put on baked chicken. I made a couple of changes. I left out the salt and did not have any eggs so I made it without it and used fresh mushrooms and I used half and half I didn't have the cream.It tasted great. The next time I won't put in the flour we like it on the thinner side I had to add more cream to thin it. I will be putting this on my rotation of meals. Thanks for such a great recipe.

It was definitely salty. I recommend not using the 1 tsp of salt and cutting back on the broth. Maybe 3/4 cup of broth or find a low sodium broth. Other than it being salty, i would also leave out the egg, nless you are quick at making this. This recipe is very time sensitive. If your not quick about adding the egg and watching it on a very low heat, the egg will scramble. The taste is great, just a little too salty.

Absolutely delicious!  I cannot eat wheat gluten and in restaurants that means a lot of sauces are off limits.  I substituted the wheat flour for Bob's Red Mill all purpose gluten free flour and it came out beautifully!  I used fresh portobellos and added diced onions.  Since the egg is added to the cream before cooking there was no hint of an issue with scrambling the egg (kept it on very low heat though to be sure).  Super easy nice recipe!!!

Great sauce.  Didn't add the cream or egg only because this sauce tasted so great before I got to that step, I just left it out.  I sauteed fresh crimini mushrooms in butter and garlic and then mixed the rest of the ingredients together and served over angel hair pasta with some pan roasted chicken thighs.  My husband told me to remember exactly what I did 'cause he wants this again.

I made this with portabello mushroom slices and some cooked spinach in the sauce, and it was great! My only complaint was the egg didn't mix as well as I expected; so I had small bits of cooked egg in the sauce. Next time I'll temper the egg.

I tried adding 3/4 cup frozen peas to add some additional flavor & color.  I also served this over rice, instead of pasta.  This tasted great this way!

I gave it four stars because as a base its really good, but with adding garlic (about 5 cloves if double recipe like I do) its fantastic!  I have also made this by adding Hormel bacon bits as well.  I also ditch the egg like other reviewers.  I don't think its necessary.  Excellent sauce!

I have used this a few times and usually add grilled chicken to the sauce and serve with seasoned rice.  I'm only rating a four because I have to dress it up a tad to get it the way I like it-it's been a while since I last made this to think of what I do-but is a great base/recipe for what I do with it. Thanks

This is a delicious recipe, I've used it before months ago* and I have it at least once a week  now, it reminds me of that sauce on that pasta at OutBack! It's simply delicious!

Really good...but was surprised at how gravy-like it is. If you used tarragon instead of Italian seasoning, it would be my Chicken Tarragon sauce!

Absolutely delicious.  I'm sure it would have been fine on it's own, but I did NOT add the egg and I did add 2 cloves of garlic to the butter & mushroom mixture.  I'm assuming no egg made it difficult to thicken, so I ended up adding an additional teaspoon of flour.  I served this over a full box of bowtie pasta, with crumbled chicken sausage & wilted spinach.  I used fat free half & half, and you'd never know (probably because of the stick of butter!).  I'd add more mushrooms (fresh, of course),  but everything was completely delicious!!

This was a very good sauce. I did as the others had suggested and omitted the egg. I do not think it would have made a huge difference. The sauce did not thinken as much as I thought. I warmed it the next day and it was much better. I used frest button mushrooms, sauted in butter. I sliced 4 medium mushrooms, but will use more next time. I like the mushrooms in this dish. I also added half of a shallot to the mushrooms as they were sauting. I poured over fettucini and sprinkled parmesan over the top. Will make this recipe again

I love this recipe.  Not only is it easy, but it results in a great tasting sauce.  It is really easy to modify, too.  I tend to cook very low fat, so I subbed the butter with equal parts promise butter, doubled the mushrooms, used whole wheat flour, water (sub for broth), salt substitute, and Greek Seasoning.  I added 4 chicken breasts (diced) before I mixed in the egg and milk (subbed fat free milk for heavy cream).  Once the chicken was cooked thru and the egg mixture was added, I poured over Whole Wheat/Spinach spaghetti.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This is the sauce I was looking for! Totally perfect for a random dish I thought to make with angel hair pasta and lemon herb chicken, which I found on all recipes as well: Simple Lemon Herb Chicken, recipe by Carolyn Stilwell. I left out the mushrooms in the sauce as a personal preference and it was still fantastic. Bowl-licking good, literally.

So happy to find this recipe and the reviews and suggestions.  I used the recipe and did what I always do...take a few suggestions plus add my own twist.  Dinner was oven roasted Italian chicken with tortellini on a bed of wilted fresh spinach with green onions and crispy pancetta.  For the sauce, I added some fresh onion and garlic (chopped) into the butter until translucent, added sliced portabella mushrooms and the capers.  I then let them sauté a bit before adding in the flour, making sure it was well mixed and cooked for a couple of minutes.  I then added pepper and chicken stock.  The wine came next.  I let all this cook together while the wine reduced.  After the wine was reduced almost half, I turned the fire to low and gradually added the cream and egg mixture.  Oh my, this was awesome.

Very good! I didn't use the egg, or mushrooms and it turned out great. We used a sauvignon blanc wine, and it really made it taste fantastic. The longer it sat, the thicker it got, even after I added chicken and some pasta noodles. Going to be adding to my collection.

I made this for a large group half of them kids. I was not sure the kids would like it since my experience with kids, they can be very picky. I was afraid I would have a lot of leftovers. Boy was I wrong. I was so pleased everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I didn't change anything. It was great the way it was. I keep this in my favorite recipes.

I thought this was great. I added a half a onion and garlic when I added the mushrooms I used a fresh mushroom mix. I also did not add the egg. My husband, who is not a mushroom pasta fan said it was good, but I could tell he didnt think it was great. I loved it though. I served it over penne pasta and steamed peas on the side. also I baked some chicken peices coated in italian breadcrumbs at 350 for 15 min and they were great on top.

I didn't have mushrooms but I used this sauce to serve over shrimp and steamed rice.  It's a great sauce with a couple of modifications.  I only used about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and it was still too salty.  I think the chicken broth I used was the problem, but nevertheless, I recommend holding the salt and adding it to taste at the end.  I will also probably cut back the Italian seasoning to 1-1 1/2 teaspoons rather than 2.  I did use the egg with the cream and I liked the consistency.  Will definitely make this again!

Yummy! I used fresh mushrooms and omitted the egg. Doesn't sound like it needed it. It was lovely as is. I didn't have Italian Seasoning so I used Herbes de Provence and it was delicious. I served it with grilled chicken breast and coloured spaghetti. My boyfriend and daughter both gave it a ten and cleaned their plates!

THIS TURNED OUT TO BE A REALLY GOOD RECIPE.  I didn't have any white wine in the house, so I had so improvise.  I used homemade chicken stock, fresh sauted mushrooms, and deglazed the pan after cooking the chicken.  The whole whole family loved dinner tonight.  I even caught my hubby licking the spoon as he cleaned up the dishes from the stove!  We will definately be making this one again!

Very yummy receipe, I have made it twice & my family loves it!.  Once used mushrooms & once substituted garlic & onion minced. Also used milk one time & did not notice much difference.  Added 2 tsp. chicken base instead of salt for extra flavor - great over mushroom ravioli & glass of Pinot Grigio.

As other reviewers I omitted the egg. I also used a touch less butter and a heavy hand with the Italian Seasoning. I used less mushrooms because I was splitting them up with a second dish. I used this in a baked ziti dish with sauteed chicken breast.   It turned out okay, but my boyfriend let it stay in the oven a bit too long, bringing it to a boiling point and thus separating the fat away. It was delicious before that. And still okay after that so I had to give it 5 stars. If you bake it make SURE you don't allow it to boil. I had intended only on browning a bit of sprinkled cheese on top.

Really good - my husband and I don't like a lot of herb taste so I reduced the Italian seasoning to less than a teaspoon. Also used sour cream instead of heavy cream since I didn't have any! Great sauce for a variety of meals!!

This recipe is amazing.  It's easy and is total indulgence.  I've made it twice now -- the first time as written, it was great but a little salty.  I speculated that the chicken broth "plus" the added salt may have been the culprit(s).  The second time I used sodium free chicken broth and a little less "added" salt than called for and liked it even better.  Additionally, the second time, after reading other reviews, I omitted the m'rooms, only used half the pasta but steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  I added the steamed veggies to the cooked pasta and sauce.  My husband loved it.

Great recipe. I omitted the mushrooms because my husband and I don't like them, but otherwise left it the same. It is very easy and has great flavor!

Thought this was a really great suace that can be modified very easily.  I used fresh mushrooms, used light cream and used basil instead of italian seasoning.  I served it with whole wheat fettucini and added broiled salmon to the sauce.  I'll definately be making this one again!

We didn't enjoy this one at all.  The sauce was watery and didn't thicken (even after sitting for about 5 min.) into the texture I expected.  It was also very bland, and I added more than double seasonings.

I thought this was pretty good. I made a few changes. First, I doubled the recipe and added 2t of minced jar garlic to the butter and sauteed flour-dusted chicken in the butter before the mushrooms (I used fresh.) I left out the egg. I had to add a bit of 1% milk at the end b/c it was too thick. I could have added more milk, it still seemed a bit thick, but the flavor was great. My guests (4 adults and 3 kids under age 7) really liked it. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was great!  The only change that I made was adding a little garlic to the butter to cook the mushrooms!  The secret to not having a egg mess is to make sure that the skillet it not too hot!  I will definatly make this again!

this was crazy good. I made it without the mushrooms because I didn't have any and it was still incredibly delicious. I served with chicken and angel hair pasta. I think this was better than our pricey italian restaurant up the street.

This was pretty good.  No changes made.  I did use it on a bag of Tortellini (10 oz or 13 oz?) and it was a lot of sauce for that.  Probably good for 12 - 16 oz of Spaghetti.  Thanks for the recipe.
