I did a couple of things differently... I used bowtie pasta and cooked in chicken broth to give it that extra chickeny flavor.  I added about a tsp of garlic powder.  Once I mixed it all up, I put it in a 350 degree oven for about 20 mins to really blend the flavors together.  Great recipe and oh-so-easy to make!

I increased the liquid ratio by adding chicken stock.  Added in some garlic and onion powders and frozen broccoli florettes.  I dumped it into a casserole dish and baked at 350 for 30 minutes Recieved 8 thumbs up from the family.  Great for a "what am I doing to do for dinner tonight" thought!

I thought this was simple & good. I added at least twice the amount of pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/2 a medium onion chopped. Definately will make again when im in a rush.

This was a great quick supper!  I use canned chicken and I would have increased the noodles!  Overall a quick weeknight meal!  The cheese adds a great flavor!

For what this recipe is- a pantry ingredient recipe- we thought it was great. Next time will try some extra spices too, as it was a little bland. But it was perfect for what I needed.

This was super easy to make and very tasty.  We added in some extra herbs just for some additional flavor, however that was just personal preference! Thanks for sharing!

Just so-so. Not great, but not horrible either. Husband said "it's filling." Not exactly the rave review I seek.

I love the versatility of Campbell's recipes!  You can interchange some of the basic ingredients and still have a great recipe!  I didn't have dried egg noodles so I used Rames brand frozen egg noodles.  I added some thyme and boiled my egg noodles in chicken broth.  So good on a cold winter day!

wow, guess my taste buds are shot, I had some left over rotisserie chicken and just cubed it up.  I didn't care for this, but my four boys actually said "Hey, this is good". even my 6 year old fuss bucket said "I Love this"  and shoveled it in.  i did add onion pwdr and garlic pwdr as stated in others reviews.  Guess I'll make it again for them.

Very, very good recipe! I just made it for dinner tonight and my kids really enjoyed. Used a little bit more of pepper, a pinch of salt and quite a few of the fresh parsley. Mmmmm, good!!!  Thanks for sharing such an easy, quick and yummy recipe. Thanks, Monica

I would give it 5 stars, but I think it needs just a little more flavor.  But it's a great 'base' for using leftover turkey, and adding whatever spices or herbs one would like.

This recipe turned out really good!!! The only thing I did different was add a little bit more milk, konriko seasoning, garlic powder and a LOT more cheese both parmesean and also some mozzerela too! And put it in the oven after you mix everything together for about 15 minutes. Good Luck!

I tried this recipe and it was great...however, I did add a few more ingredients.  I added a little bit of chopped onion and garlic while icooked my chicken in a pan.  I added a little bit of ocrushed red pepper for a little zing.  This was a quick and easy recipe that I will definitelyy make again.  My husbandis not what I would call a picky eater. But he LOVED it and so did I..  I only gave it four stars because I had to add a few ingredients to make it less bland.

I have used this recipe for years, except we use 2 cups of shredded Mozzarella cheese, using 1 1/2 cups mixed in and then we put the remainder sprinkled on top when it's about 10 mintues before we take it out.   It's fantastic!

This was a bit bland for us as is. I prepared the noodles on the stove, the chicken in a crockpot, then mixed it altogether in the crockout and let it sit til we were ready to eat. I added a half block of velveeta cheese and a 1/4c bacon alfredo to moisten it up some (and to help me clean out my fridge.) With those additions, I'd give it 5 stars, simply because my kids and husband devoured it!
