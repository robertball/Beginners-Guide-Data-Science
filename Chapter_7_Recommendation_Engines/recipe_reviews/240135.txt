Very good!! Made this for dinner and followed the recipe exactly. Turned out great and on the rolls (from part 1) it was a great meal. I typically don't like cooking a roast on a stovetop but it worked out very well and if you have time constraints this is the way to go. Make sure to dip your sandwich in the au jus because it mixes so well with the beef, bread and horseradish!! Definitely will be made again!!

This was delicious! I made it for a nice Valentine's dinner and my husband loved it. We are from Western New York and I think with a little practice (on my part, I'm no chef!) these sandwiches would be just as good as any Beef on Weck we could get locally.
I also liked the video, it was very helpful and Chef John made it fun to make.

Oh my gosh!  This was amazing!  My husband did most of the cooking and it turned out great!  We set out to make no changes but we could not find the right cut of meat.  We did find a top round roast that he cut in half (longways) and trimmed the fat.  It worked just fine.  The meat was very tender.  That was the only thing we changed.  We served it with mashed potatoes and used the broth as gravy and for dipping our sandwich.  I wish we had taken a picture but it smelled so good we couldn't wait to eat!

These rolls are delicious. We really like caraway so I added a teaspoonful to the dough.
Thanks, Chef John

Also we spread mayonnaise with olive oil and stone ground spicy mustard on the slightly warmed rolls. We added fresh minced garlic and served with horseradish. Instead of the meats that were suggested we cut up NY strip (hey it was on sale!) cooked medium rare.
