sooo good! especially when you first take them out of the oven, they're just like air. I added 1/2 Teaspoon of vanilla extract. To keep the jam from spreading all over the cookie, just make small thumbprints!  I am only 12 so i may not be that much help...but my whole family loved them and asked me to make more!

INCREDIBLE!  This is my kind of cookie...I made them for a cookie swap, but decided not to take them...they were too yummy!  I tried 3 different kinds of jam: rasp., boysenberry and blueberry.  Raspberry won hands down around here. 
The dough is very sticky, so I refridgerated it for a while to make it easier to work with.  I used a small 1" stainless steel scoop to make the cookies, and then the back of a round stainless 1/4 teaspoon to make the prints.  I dipped the jam with the same 1/4 t. so it fit perfectly into the holes.  I only got 3-3 1/2 dz cookies from this recipe as opposed to the 72 servings listed.  Bake until JUST starting to lightly brown around the edges.  These cookies spread out to 2" while baking, but the final product was delicate and buttery with a sweet and tart rasperry center.  FAB!

For several years, this has been my go-to cookie recipe when I need something fast and fabulous.  The only difference is the presentation; I don't make thumbprint cookies.  Instead, I reserve 3/4 c of the batter and the remainder is pressed into the bottom of a 13"x9" baking pan, with a slight "lip" at the outside edge to hold in the preserves.  The preserves (apricot or raspberry is the best in my humble estimation) are spread over that, and lastly the reserved batter is  crumbled over the top of the preserves. Bake as directed.  Cut into squares when cooled.  Everyone I've offered these to LOVE these and many have asked for the recipe and are amazed at its sweet simplicity.

Proof positive that the simplest recipes are almost always the best. How can four ingredients come together to taste so darned lovely? Easiest way to mix is to pulse in your food processor. Like almost everyone else, I found the number of cookies promised to be almost double the number it actually made. 31 exactly. Keep a tiny bit of confectioners sugar around for dipping whatever implement you use to make the indentations (handle of a wooden spoon, your thumb, measuring tsp, etc) so that it doesn't stick to the dough. Remember that the key to making them look picture perfect is to avoid the temptation to put more than a small dab of jam in the indentation. This avoids "oven boil over" and the consequent mess. A+ for a superb recipe that is not only simple to make, it bakes up looking like it belongs on the cover of Bon Appetit and tastes so wonderful, it's the stuff dreams are made of! Note: for ehuber and others who had trouble with the dough spreading when baked and tasting inedibly greasy, that's indicative of an inadequate measure of flour. Knead in more flour, 1-2 Tb at a time, until incorporated. When the dough stays together and doesn't cling to your hands, but is not crumbly, you've added enough. If it's  sticky, add another Tb of flour. Allow to rest 20 minutes or more after you finish kneading in the flour to relax the gluten so that the finished product will not be tough. It just takes a little practice to develop the feel for dough with the proper consistency.

I was born in Sweden and my mom always made these cookies! If you substitute about 1/4 cup of the flour for potato flour, the texture and flavor becomes even better!

Nice, pretty looking little thubmprint type cookies. The dough is very easy to work with... I added about 1/4 tsp of vanilla and a splash of almond extract - gave it a wonderful delicate flavor. I used raspberrry jam, and they turned out great... the trick is to use very little jam (about 1/6 of a tsp) - enough to not quite fill the depression in the cookie, and keep an eye on them near the end of the baking time - once the jam starts to bubble, it may 'boil over' and run out of the imprint. About 13 minutes was the right baking time for me. Also, this recipie did NOT make anywhere near 72 cookies for me... closer to 40. But, still tasty, and a very easy, simple cookie to make.

I love these cookies! They're so easy to make and the end results are just fantastic. They make your whole kitchen smell like sweet, buttery heaven! My only change to this recipe was adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the dough, which yielded very tasty cookies. I used both apricot and raspberry preserves to fill in the thumbprints. I must say I do like the raspberry best! These little cookies are very pretty too, looking like precious jewel-topped cream-colored morsels. I have already made a few batches, and I will be making these again and again. Thanks for the recipe, Crandall!

Very good! My swedish grandma used to make these all the time! I put them in the oven for 10 minutes instead of 15-20.  But overall, excellent and very easy to make!

Delicious and so very easy to make.  I made a half batch, but mistakenly added the same amount of sugar as a full batch.  To my surprise, it tasted pretty good.  To make it more presentable, I pressed rounds of dough into a small muffin pan and spooned the jam inside the crevices.  A recipe I'll definitely keep!

Definitely important to follow the directions exactly on this one. The flour is 2 cups sifted then measured (not measured then sifted). It is written that way, but very important to note. I also found that jam or jelly works better than chunkier preserves. Also make sure the butter is softened and that you cream the butter and sugar for awhile before adding the flour. Again, all things written in the recipe, but if you tend to not follow recipes exactly (like me!) it could get you in trouble on this one!

we were making our wild plum jelly and I got online to see what I could make with it I decided on this recipe. It was great! My grandma said it was superb and I agree. It turned out to be crisp and fragile (yum!) I added 1\2 tbs of vanilla. the dough was fine and I toke it out of the oven at 10 min.

I baked these for my work family. Made as directed and perfect cookies. Delicious! For fun factor, you can flavor and fill with anything. If you just indent and bake then indent again when they come out of the oven. My favorite was when cooled fill with nutella and dip in melted chocolate and top with hazelnuts. Another hit was using almond extract and when cooled  top with shredded coconut and a marchiano cherry and then drizzle with white chocolate. I had the men begging me to make more for money. I have my new go to cookie!

I followed the recipe exactly but ended up with extremely flat, *very* buttery cookies.  They were similar to Irish lace cookies in texture and flavor (minus the oats and with jam on top).  I think next time I'll halve the butter and see if it holds up better to baking.  The flavor is pretty good, though a little too buttery.

These cookies are phenomenal!!! So simple and, yet, perfect! The cookies taste like buttery sugar air. I couldn't help myself from adding vanilla extract, but I'm betting it's unnecessary. I tend to pay attention to reviews, so I used raspberry jam to fill half of my cookies because the vast majority proclaimed raspberry the filling front-runner! I'm here to tell you, at least in my case, the vast majority is WRONG!! I filled the other half of my cookies with lemon curd, and they FLEW off the plate!! During our Easter celebration, I actually heard my husband say, "Aww!! Raspberry is dumb!! Where'd all the lemon go?" This from a man who usually spurns anything without chocolate. Lemon curd for the win!!

Amazingly simple and quick!!!!  Tastes great and everyone will think you put a lot more work into these cookies than you really did ;) One tip:  when you shape your dough balls, make them very very small because they do spread out quite a bit during baking.  Like other reviewers stated, keeping them in the oven for 10 minutes is just perfect (not longer).

This is a classic, perfect recipe, imperfectly transcribed.  The reason that some of us used too little flour is because the recipe calls for 2 cups "sifted" flour.  Since most flour sold these days is pre-sifted, the inclusion of this term indicates you actually need to sift flour.  Turns out, you don't, and if you do you'll throw the whole thing off.  Otherwise, with just a hint (1/4 tsp) of almond extract and raspberry jam, wonderful!  oh and definitely add a pinch of salt if you use unsalted butter

PERFECT cookie! I wasn't sure if I needed salted or unsalted butter so I used a stick of each. I'd say either do that or use all salted, in my opinion. I added about 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla with the butter/sugar mix. Did it need it? Probably not. I think it would have been perfect without it too. They took 12 minutes for me. I used raspberry preserves and apricot preserves. Delicious and SO simple. I didn't have to refrigerate the dough, it was perfect to make the balls right away. I got 51 cookies out of the dough.

The cookies came out tasting a little off. It tasted like I was eating flour and sugar and butter, but I think a good cookie should taste like a cookie. Not its ingredients.

Great for a cookie swap as these Swedish creations don't contain the cream cheese of Polish kolaches!  I added an extra cup of sifted flour as I didn't like the original consistency (too fluffy and spread out too much when baked). Buttery. fruity, moist and delicious! I dusted powdered sugar atop to aid in separating cookies after being stacked on display platter.

There's a reason why this cookie has so many 5's!  For my taste, it's the classic Christmas cookie - but besides having magnificent taste, it's one of the easiest doughs you'll ever work with - and with it, you can make 100s+ of different cookies.  This is it, folks - Look no further!

These cookies were awesome!  I read the recipe about an hour ago, and just had to go try them out. The only variation I made was to add 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. almond extract.  Be sure to sift the flour before measuring!  I used a 1" cookie scoop and the back of a round 1/2 tsp. measuring spoon to make the indentations.  I dipped the measuring spoon in powdered sugar each time so it wouldn't stick.  Then, I rinsed off the measuring spoon and used it to measure in the jam.  I only baked mine 10 minutes and they were perfect.  Be sure not to make the indentations too deep or they will tear on the bottom when you take them up.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and had nothing but problems. First the dough was so dry it was just in crumbles, then after kneading it I finally got to the point where I could roll it into balls to bake. After being in the oven for not even half the recommended baking time the cookies were as flat as a pancake and half burnt.

Delicious!! And amazingly easy. Also, I love how you can make this anytime because these are ingredients that are usually on hand. Just a note though: this recipe does NOT make 72 cookies. I cut the recipe in half and it resulted in 14 cookies.

Delicious cookie. A few disagreements with recipe directions and comments. My dough needed 2 cups measured then sifted of flour, otherwise it was too sticky (on a humid day it would need more flour). Recipe didn't say whether to use greased or ungreased pan so I used parchment. It worked okay, but I didn't get the smooth edges that many of the pictures show. I baked them at 350 for 13 minutes and this seemed to work well - slightly brown on edges. BUT, this DUD NOT give me close to 72 cookies! I measured the balls to be sure they were 1" diameter, but only got 42 cookies.  Will definitely make these again, but will double the recipe next time.

I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the dough and used strawberry preserves. I used a tablespoon to scoop then the back of a 1/4 tsp to imprint the dough and fill in with the preserves.  These kind of melt in your mouth when fresh out of the oven since the center is warm and sweet and the cookie is light and buttery.  Had to take these in to share with everyone because they would not have lasted very long in the house!

This is probably my mistake, but this was a disaster! Like a few other reviewers, I followed the recipe closely and ended up with flat, burned, shapeless cookies. They were also so full of butter that they were almost inedibly greasy. I had the first batch of cookies in the oven for 15 minutes and they came out burned. Second batch for 8 minutes and they are underdone; both batches soaking with butter.

Does anyone have any advice about what might have gone wrong? I have never made thumbprint cookies before so I probably messed it up somehow.

SPECTACULAR! Did not need to cook as long as the receipe states nor at such a high temperature. Cooked for about 14 minutes at 325. But the cookies are HEAVENLY!

Just based on the flavor and texture of the cookie, I'd give it a 5.  However, here's what I experienced that brought it down to a 3.  First of all, I just barely made it to 3 1/4 dozen, not the 6 dozen the recipe says.  I measured the dough balls evenly with a 1-inch cookie scoop and made the indentations with a round 1/2-teaspoon measuring spoon dipped in flour (the dough is rather sticky).  For the first batch I put in a heaping 1/2 teaspoon (measuring spoon) of the jam like it said.  Way too much.  1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon, level or slightly rounded is fine.  Also, let the cookies cool on the sheets 1-2 minutes before taking them off.  They'll fall apart on you otherwise.  Other than the problems above, these cookies are really good.

Great recipe, minimal ingredients, tasty. Not sure it makes 6 dozen as noted, I doubled it for Christmas and got maybe 5 dozen. Maybe I made my cookies too big. Followed the exact recipe, would add vanilla next time around.  Anyway a great option for those that have an egg allergy, which was my main reason for making.

I love these cookies!  They were my favorite as a kid.  Simple, easy and an inexpensive cookie to make.  I did add a dash of salt to the dough for flavor and some vanilla powdered extract.  Love these; I am going to try different jelly centers.

Very good and so easy.  As soon as I saw how much dough there was I knew I wasn't going to get 72 cookies- only ended up with 28 although I would/should have gone smaller on the first tray and probably would have gotten another 6 that way.  So yummy I will double next time.  The dough was slightly dry (I will add a little vanilla next time) but when they cracked a little with the thumbprint they were very easy to reshape.  Used strawberry all-fruit jelly.  Next time (which will be very soon because I always have these ingredients on hand- who doesn't?) I will try apricot and raspberry...Can't go wrong with these.

I added 1 tsp vanilla as suggested by another reviewer, and really liked the flavor. Definitely make sure you cream the butter and sugar extremely well! I was making mine while also holding a fussy 8-month-old, so didn't notice until I was forming the balls that there were chunks of butter still in mine. So a few of mine spread out too much and the dough cracked when I tried to push in the thumbprint. Used raspberry preserves and the flavors were so yummy even if the cookies weren't so pretty thanks to my errors.

I need to make these again.  I thought they were just okay but I'm willing to try them one more time to see if I like them better next time.  Found that they got a little dry after being in the fridge for a while and were hard to press the hole in them without them falling apart.  This was not the case with the first batch I baked but by the time I went to make the remaining dough this is what happened.

Delicious and easy to make!  Use real butter if you want a flaky pastry.  I made this recipe with Becel margarine on one occasion and it was fine, but definitely not as rich.  The kids enjoy making these, too!

I have no idea what happened, I followed the recipe exactly and mine were flat as pancakes and running off the sheet . I only had them in the oven for 10 min then took them out for fear they would run all over the oven. I have made thumprints before and this has never happened.

These were a lite flavored cookie with just enough sweetness from the seedless red raspberry jam I used in thise recipe. 1st cookie tray I made got a little crisper then I wanted, so the 2nd tray I put in for 10-12 minutes. I think I also didn't make the thumbprint big enough, some of my jam runth over. But hubby gave me a 4 star his thought in the over all taste of the cookie. I'd make this one again. And try my homemade pineapple jam in it.

These cookies just came out of the oven, and everyone is loving them. I added pure almond extract to the batter, and didn't measure the flour - I added sifted flour till the dough was tacky but not sticky. I used a cookie scoop to measure the dough and instead of my thumb I poked down in the center with my index finger. Then I used a 1/4 tsp to drop in the "jam". I didn't use jam or jelly, I used wild lingonberries stirred with sugar. These cooked up golden and soft. I will be making a LOT more.

These have been a family favorite for years. The only difference is we use almond extract/flavoring in place of the vanilla, which adds an even better taste. Only use jam or preserves, as jelly will   run over and will be very messy & unattractive with presentation.

Have just taken the cookies out of the oven and WOW ,they are much better than expected!
I added the vanilla extract and almond as another reviewer suggested , used half the amount whole wheat flour and the ore white flour, and used 200 grams of butter instead of 225.
I made them pretty big so only about 30 - I think next time I will make them just a bit smaller.
I added the jam slightly lower than the edge which is very important.
Will definitely make them again!,

very nice and simple cookie, great they have no eggs too! added 1 tsp vanilla, chilled for about 30 minutes, used my 1 tbsp scoop and got 37 cookies, baked 12 minutes on silpat lined sheets, used apricot and blueberry jam.
I made again using toffee bits, added 4 ounces, filled with melted chocolate, made 40 cookies using 1 tbsp scoop, really good!

what a nice recipe...4 ingredients - and it's delicious.  I only got 24 cookies, next time I'll make the balls smaller and try different jams.  A great go-to recipe since ingredients are so readily available.  Thank you for sharing...

Fabulously delicious and easy! The only issue I had was, when I indented them with my thumb print, they cracked on the sides. But I love how few ingredients are needed. I also added some vanilla as other reviewers suggested.

I have used this recipe for years & it is so easy & perfect for things like baby or wedding showers! So pretty & customizable. The only thing that I do differently is use powdered sugar instead of white sugar. I'm not sure how much of a difference this makes but next time I'll try it w/ the white sugar to see.

Can't believe I haven't rated this recipe- I've made these many times and everyone loves them. I don't add extract; I love the traditional flavor of these, and prefer to make them as written. I usually bake mine on a baking stone, and 20 minutes seems to be perfect. I always use various flavors of an "all fruit" spread. They're rarely quite as perfect as the picture, but still pretty and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. :-)

I took these to a cookie exchange party and had someone tell me how good they were compared to the store bought ones! Its a very simple and easy recipe though it will not yield 72 cookies. I think I got 40 or 45 something like that. I used 1 tsp vanilla and black raspberry jam. Also rolled them in crushed walnuts as another reviewer.  12 min was perfect for my oven. Any longer made them too brown and toasty.

This is the easiest cookie to make ever, and with so few ingredients! I love this recipe and make it all the time. You can also make this for Valentine's Day, just shape the dough into a heart shape, then press flat with knuckles to get a heart-shaped well to put the jam/preserves in. And I use sugar-free Smucker's preserves to make myself feel a little better about devouring them!

I made these for Easter dessert. I made one change, however. Rather than baking them like a cookie, I put the dough into muffin cups. I filled them with lingonberry jam and bake about 5 minutes longer than the given time. The were crunchy, crumbly and delicious! A definate keeper!

These are so good!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and they came out perfect.  I'm not sure why some people have had such problems, maybe not enough flour, or possibly incorrect oven temp?  I put several different kinds of jam in mine, you only need like 1/2 teaspoon in each cookie, they didn't bubble over at all.  I made some of mine a bit bigger and those held more jam.  Either way they were super easy and fabulous!

Love this cookie. My mum used to make them when I was a kid.

I made 43 cookies with this recipe, and baked them for 8-9 minutes. 

I used red currant jelly and apple jelly. I made the indents with an 1/8 teaspoon measuring spoon, and filled the cookies with about that much jelly.

If you get cracks when making the indents, smooth them out with your fingers. If you don't, your jelly might make a lava flow out onto the pan!

The cookies taste great, but Im curious why no one else is having trouble with the dough like I am! I dont know if kneading is necessary but the dough comes out too crumbly to form into a ball. when i do get it into a ball it bakes out flat. I dont know if i am using to much butter or flour but whatever it is it isnt working for me.  [Edit] There was too much butter. I cut out some and tried the recipe again and it worked out great! these are now some of my favorite cookies :)

This is identical to a recipe I have used for a few years now. It says to make the cookies the size of an olive and it has a yield of 60 cookies. My husband and I doubled the recipe and ended up with 116 cookies. We could've had 120, but we didn't want to put in a new cookie sheet for just 4 cookies. Besides, our three dogs were sitting at our feet begging for dough, and since there aren't any eggs, we all ate those four cookies raw!!!

I use the back of my Pampered Chef tomato corer to make the indentation in the top. It makes it nice and smooth.

I use red current jelly, which I put into a pastry bag and fill the cookies that way. It's a lot less messy than trying to use a spoon to fill them. 

My only comment is that you have to be very vigilant about watching the cookies at the end. It's easy to go just a tad bit too long and have the jelly boil over.

I don't understand what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies weren't even in the oven 10 minutes and they were black on the bottom and yet not cooked through.  I thought maybe I wrote down the wrong temperature but I hadn't.  Not too pleased, I loved these cookies when I was a kid but I never had the recipe.  I'll keep looking I guess.

I tried these cookies with another Swedish tradition - Lingonberry jam.  They were pretty good, but unfortunately lingonberry jam baked isn't all that great, too tart.  The jam is great on toast or pancakes though. I also tried a few of these cookies without the jam and they were delicious, light, and were gone in 30 minutes.  I will definitely make these again, probably with raspberry or orange marmalade.

Made these exactly as recipe instructed and they turned out great. Used the food processor for most of the blending & mixing so it was zippy fast. Cooked them for 15 minutes and they were perfect. They are so buttery and almost melt in your mouth... it's hard to stop eating them! Thank you for this recipe.

Very yummy!!! Fast and easy recipe. The only problem I had was that the dough was very crumbly so I added a little milk until the dough kept together when kneeded.

These were excellent! I served them to the "ladies" and got rave reviews. I was pretty nervous because these were British women that weren't used to this kind of cookie. They gobbled them right up. All of them. A definite keeper!

Yummy. :) I wanted some jam-filled thumbprint-type cookies, and these were excellent. I used margarine instead of butter, and they were still extra-tasty (although I know butter would be AWESOME!). They only took maybe 11 minutes to cook, and my oven usually runs cool, so keep an eye on the cookies! Thanks so much for sharing!

These were easy to make, and better than I thought they would be, at first bite. They had a bitter after taste, that made my stomach hurt. After three, I didn't need any more.  By the next day any that hadn't been eaten were thrown away.

These were very, VERY good.  Watch them carefully, because they overbake quickly.
I did one batch with seedless blackberry and one with red current, which were my favorite. :)

These are now my husband's favorite Christmas cookie! The dough is so light to the taste buds. They're a little time-consuming to make because of how you indent the center and add the filling but well worth the effort in the end. I used raspberry jam that is used for the Fischer Scones at the Puyallup Fair here in Washington. YUM!!! These were so good that I'm going to make another batch tomorrow!
I had to come back and edit my review. These were the favorites on Christmas Day and they have been renamed at my house. They are now called "THE Cookie" Maybe mine didn't come out as puffy as the photos depict but the flavor is so incredibly simply good.

With only four ingredients, I wasn't sure how much I was going to like these. They are delicious. I used a 1.5 Tbs scoop rather than making 1 inch balls, so I only got around 20 cookies out of the batch. Next time I'll use a smaller scoop. Also, didn't have any jam in the house, so I used strawberry preserves.

I made them as written, and they were an excellent cookie.  Everyone who tasted them fell in love.  And they're a pretty cookie to boot.  I took the suggestion to make the thumbprint with a 1/2 tsp measuring spoon, and that really helped to keep the jam from spreading out too much.  Remember not to overdo the jam.

I made these for a cookie party and they were a huge hit. One of the attendees requested I make them for our Christmas cookie exchange and another attendee called me on the phone later on to rave about them. 
After reading lots of comments and reviews, I altered the recipe slightly...I added a little almond extract to the cookie dough and I also added about 1/8 cup extra sugar. I also did one tray where I rolled the dough in finely chopped pistachios. I used triple berry preserves and I baked the cookies 11 minutes. 
I will say that the cookies rolled in the pistachios were everyone's favorite. 
I've saved and bookmarked the recipe and will be making them again for sure!

Wonderful! I added a pinch of salt but otherwise followed the recipe precisely, including sifting the flour before measuring it. I like the pure, simple flavors of a soft butter cookie; no extracts needed. Watch the time - mine were browning by 10 minutes and I think 15 would have been too much.

I made these cookies following the original recipe ALMOST exactly.  They were a big hit with my family.  I did not sift my flour (King Arthur AP), and did not refrigerate my dough.  I found that the 1" balls made rather large cookies,  which I found to be too large for a jam-filled thumbprint.  So,  I split each 1" ball of dough in half for my second batch,  and that made the perfect sized cookie, with just the right jam to cookie ratio.  It also yielded around 48 cookies, which was great as I want to use this recioe for my cookie exchange.  Now I only have to make the recipe twice for that!  The smaller cookies baked for 9 minutes.

Followed the recipe to a t and yet the dough was so crumbly, I found it impossible to shape into balls or make a thumbprint. Thankfully I managed to salvage it  and make shortbread. If you're looking to make thumbprint cookies, look elsewhere.

Something is seriously wrong with this recipe. After 2 attempts to get the dough to come together even a little bit, I gave up and went on to a more thorough recipe. There is absolutely no binding agent within the ingredients (butter is technically a fat agent not a binding agent), so those that said this was a success  for them must have added something to the recipe. Won't recommend this nor try again.

I made these for a cookie exchange and they were my boyfriend's favorite out of everything he tried. I did have to make one change though. The 1-inch balls were too large to work with so I halved their size (which resulted in more cookies so that was fine with me!) Also, I found that even with mounding the jam up above the level of the cookie it cooked down a good deal so make sure to really pile the jam up. Making the indentation in the middle is best done by repeatedly poking it with your index finger to the desired depth; this helps prevent the cookie dough cracking when shaped.

These turned out nothing like the photo.   The recipe did not work for me.  The recipe needs more flour or less butter and a shorter cooking time.

Very easy recipe. However, it needs some more flour; around 1/3 cup more so the dough stops sticking in my hands and can be easily shaped into tiny balls. I also added 1 large egg, 1 tsp banana essence to the butter and sugar mixture, and 1/2 tsp baking powder to the flour. After shaping each ball, I roll it in some white sugar before placing in baking sheet and indenting it for half inch and filling with strawberry jam. It turns out so yummy especially with the flavor of banana and strawberry together. My sister-in-law loves it much and my kids and niece too. They eat it with gourmet. Bottom line, it's delicious easy and fast made.

So good! Easy to work with the dough. This is fast and easy. My daughter was very happy to help! I was so surprised at how good they were for the few ingredients it has. Next time, after I roll them into a ball, I will roll them in coconut flakes and then process as the recipe states

Fabulous recipe! I always had a problem of the cookies cracking or all of the jam boiling over in my old thumbprint cookie recipe, but these are perfect. I did roll the balls in crushed walnuts before making an indentation in them. This gives them a little more flavor. Overall is amazing!

Actually quite good in its simplicity.  I made 1 inch balls for the first batch. Just too big for what I wanted. Had the next pan ready and rolled up, but then ended dividing the rest in half for a nice small more bite size cookie.  12/25/14-update.  Taste even better than before.  Better at room temp.( Had them in cooler)

One of the best cookie recipes I have ever had.  Very simple to make, I did add about a cap full of vanilla but it's your preference, this cookie is soooo delicious.  Very buttery but delicate.  I used raspberry jam.   I also took another reviewers advice about using the 1/4th tsp to make the "thumb print" and then used it to fill the thumb prints with the jam.

The "dough" didn't hold together and the cookies themselves didn't taste like anything! There are more in-depth recipes for this type of cookie, I'll look to those next time.

Baked at 375 degrees for 10 minutes, my cookies were ruined - burnt to a black crisp on the bottom. Baked at 325 degrees for 10-13 minutes, they were delicate  morsels from heaven. So. Watch your oven temp and keep a close eye on these as they bake. I got 8 good cookies and 35 bad ones on my first try. Really good with raspberry preserves.

I made these mostly as directed with elderberry jelly, and my husband gave then five stars. Based on conflicting comments about the flour, I didn't sift it. The cookies were a tad try and cracked when I made the imprints, but they still tasted great. Next time I will sift to see if that prevents the cracking and makes a prettier cookie. I did not have problems with the cookies spreading too much or being greasy.

After reading the reviews that said that the recipe didn't make as many cookies as stated, I chose to make them smaller to get a higher yield. I scooped the dough out in level half tablespoons before rolling into balls and got 60 cookies. The cookies were bite-sized but could have been better with more jelly. Next time I will make them slightly bigger so that they hold more filling.

This is the first time I've made these. They stood out to me immediately as they seemed simple to make, but still looked delicious. I was right in what I thought as it was unimaginably easy, and of course they were delicious! The 'Rossenmunnar' are just the right size in my opinion, they kind of fit into the "One bite and they're gone" category. I used half quantity as this was just a test run, I also shared them out between family and friends and they all seemed to love it and some thought "Like jam tarts, but in biscuit form" They are perfect with a cup of tea/coffee, or even as a scrumptious bite-sized treat! If I had to pick one downside, hence why I only gave it 4 stars, they went a little dry and hard after a couple of days so they need to be eaten while fresh. Overall, this is a wonderful recipe that I would recommend to anybody, including myself - yes I will be making these again!

TUMME! (which is yummy in Swedish)  These are the best cookies ever!!!  I made them exactly like the recipe states.  So easy to make.  My butter was not quite room temperature so I had a little trouble rolling into balls so I waited 15 minutes and then the batter was perfect.  I used raspberry jam and it was delicious.  I agree that this only makes half the amount 36 instead of 72.  I used a 1 inch melon baller to scoop them out so that they were uniform in size when I rolled them.  LOL My son just came and gave me a thumbs up on the cookies he just ate.  Enjoy and thanks for the great recipe!

This cookie is a big hit with my family. Between three of us these cookies are usually gone in a couple of days. It's really easy to make as well. The only tricky part was figuring out exactly how long it needs to stay in the oven. The first time I ended up letting them cook a couple of minutes too long and they were a little dry. For me, the perfect time is 14 minutes, but everyone's oven is a little different.

These were very easy to make and based on a previous review I put the dough in the fridge for a while and when I got it out it was too hard to work with so I just gave it a few minutes and voila!  I used Red Raspberry Jam.  Not only was the taste divine but the red was great for Christmas!  The only thing I may try next time is to make the dough a little sweeter and maybe put 1/4 tsp. of vanilla as well.

Excellent.  I followed some of the reviewers'  advice and subbed in 1/4 cup potato flour, and added vanilla and almond extracts.  In addition, I would suggest adding a pinch of salt to the dough if using unsalted butter.  Very pretty cookie.  I used some of my red and green hot pepper jellies.

Cookies were great, but I did make some changes.
First, I had the oven set to 350 and watched the cookies, mine took about 7-8 minutes any longer then the bottom would be kinda burnt.
Second, Mine did not spread out, I flattened them to how thick I wanted them and left enough thickness to press the center and add the jam. 
Lastly, I added a little bit of vanilla.
I used raspberry and it was YUM!

They weren't bad, but they definitely only needed to be in the oven for about 10-12 minutes (first batch ended up way too dark), and I found them to be a bit greasy. If I were to make thumbprints again, I'd try using less butter, and maybe adding some milk & vanilla.

These were super simple.  Why they weren't as good as they should have been, I didn't factor this into my rating.  The reason being was I used olive based margarine which is something I will never do again in any form of baking whatsoever.

Even despite that, these were delicious!

I loved this cookie.  I used Raspberry as suggested I will also try lemon curd.  Remember to use a good quality seedless Raspberry jam.  I used Irish Butter.
This cookie melts in your mouth.

When you make the thumbprints, keep a small bowl of icing sugar nearby so you can dip your thumbprint tool into it between each press. That way, the thumbprint tool won't stick and ruin the shape of the cookie as you struggle to remove it! ^^  Also, I put my jam in a zip top bag and snip a tiny hole to make the jam filing easier! I make these cookies every Christmas, so simple and yummy!

Absolutely lovely! These were easy, though time-consuming, to make, and the results were wonderful - a shortbread-like cookie with the perfect texture. Just be certain to use a strongly-flavored jam - a tart one would work especially well. I used blueberry preserves, which had a comparatively mild flavor, and the flavor of the jam was somewhat lost under the flavor of the cookie.

These were just like bakery cookies.  I made it with two different jams and they didn't spread out. 2nd Time:  I made in a 13x9 greased pan as a reviewer suggested. Set aside 3/4 cup dough and pat rest into bottom of pan as a crust. Spread jam on top and sprinkle reserved dough over all.  Bake as instructed and cut into squares.

These are very much like a shortbread cookie.  I really like the addition of the jam.  Very nice for a Christmas tray and keep well in fridge. They will be a regular Christmas cookie for me.  I used the end of a wooden spoon to make the indent and cupped the dough in my palm.  I found that worked very well.

I've made this recipe several times - I love it!  A huge bonus is that it has so few ingredients and looks great without much effort.  The only trick I've found is to watch them and make sure they aren't too golden- too overdone and they just don't have the right taste.

The taste was there, but you could never serve these to anyone.  They flattened out and were extremely crumbly.  I will never make them again.

Really nice recipe. I found it delicious. However, my dough was a little odd to work with, it got pretty sticky. Later on, my cookies were quite dry as well. I might have to work with a little less flour next time. They were delicious though.

I was looking for a linzer-type recipe and decided to make these with my Christmas assortment last year. They were by far the favorite!  Used Raspberry jam and added 1/2 tsp vanilla to batter.  So simple and delicious.  I had to make a second batch to take home to the family - the first batch was devoured quickly! I'm planning on taking these to my cookie exchange this year. Enjoy!

Not too sweet - just right.  Did find another jam filled recipes with almond extract that added a little bit more to the dough (which I prefer).  I chilled the dough for 20 min prior to shaping into balls.  I used a mango pineapple jam - which worked great.  I put the jam in a ziploc bag and snipped the corner and squeezed it into the hole.  I baked it at 350 for 14 min and turned out great.

SO GOOD.  I'll admit, they're not really that pretty, but that doesn't take away from the taste!  I think the trick to making sure that the middle doesn't run is to use preserves rather than jam, but it really doesn't matter much.  Also, this recipe only makes 3 dozen.  I'm not sure HOW you could manage to get 72 out of it!  The cookies would be the size of dimes.  Love this recipe though!  It's GREAT.

This cookie surprised me, bc of the taste you get from only using butter,flour and sugar. Dough is easy to handle. I like the center, and the fact that when you use a different kind of jam, the taste will change too.  One dissapointment: they look ugly! I am determined to find a way to make them prettier...

These cookies turned out pretty yummy! In my first batch, i think i made the cookies too big, so there was too much cookie and not enough jam. But i made the cookies a bit smaller and they turned out great. i used a floured 1/2 tsp spoon to make the indents and filled them with raspberry jam. good cookies, and real easy to make!

Easy to make and really good! I took them to a cookie exchange and they were a big hit with everyone. I used strawberry filling.   Also FYI, I definitely don't know how this recipe could make 72 cookies, I ended up with about half that many.  And for you beginning bakers out there, make sure to use UNSALTED butter! :)

Normally, I don't like dry cookies.  I like mine on the chewier side, but these were fantastic!  I couldn't quite figure out how to put the "thumbprint" in the dough without cracking the edge around it.  (If anyone has any hints, they would be appreciated as I'm not a baker.)  But they tasted soooooo good and melted in my mouth.  Will make again, if I can figure out how to thumbprint without cracking the dough.  =)

I followed the recipe to a T, but as just a few others have said, I'm sad to say it came out a disaster. I don't know if I did something wrong, but I think the dough was too sandy and when I worked the dough into the little balls, they were very delicate. In the oven I watched as they bubbled up with holes, spread out like a pancake mess. I took them out at 10 minutes and they were already ruined. They're very greasy, too, though. Is there a better recipe, or tips on how to make this come out better? I even refrigerated the dough and used cool cookie sheets.

Delicious, however I found that roughly 13 minutes @ 345 F was just fine. Also, I would suggest using wax paper under the cookies in case the jam bubbles off the cookie a bit.

Five stars for simplicity and tastiness!  Do not soften the butter or the batter becomes sticky; it's so much easier to work with when the butter is cold (or the batter is chilled).  My batch yielded 4 1/2 dozen, even with judicious use of a 1 inch melon baller.  Blackberry jam rocks, as does raspberry.  I also found that making the indentation at the same time as rolling it into a ball eliminates any cracking in the round sides. I used my index finger--again, easy.

It got a little weird when I added the flour (like when I mix pie dough in my food processor) but it was SOOOO good!  And buttery!  So buttery!  I really recommend it.  It doesn't take too long to make and my mom loved them!  I made them with prune jelly (eww...) so they'd be like my mom' mom's kolackys.

A very yummy simple cookie. I didnt't sift the flour as I had no sifter in the kitchen I was in, but they turned out just fine.  As to the crumblyness of the dough...i found if you roll the cookies with closed hands, almost like you are applying hand lotion, they don't crack. 14 minutes was fine.

I have always been a fan of raspberry cookies and this is my first time making it at home. They turned out wonderful. We also used mango jam because i like mango and it goes really well with it. 
I followed exactly what the recipe said and it turned out very well.

I made these after finding them on AllRecipes' International Christmas Cookie site, which is a brilliant idea by the way. Everyone that tried these loved them and, for the first time ever, I had immediate requests for the recipe. There is nothing to change about these cookies, they are perfection! These will become a Christmas tradition :)

Having made similar cookies before ("crown jewels", thumbprint cookies, etc), this is by far the easiest, and involves fewer ingredients to hassel with. I was unwilling to try jelly, but I did use boysenberry preserves, and it tastes great. I used my pinky for the indentations, and tried not to overflow the preserves in them (and succeeded). I'm trying to leave a few for my husband when he gets home, but I'm not sure I'll be able to, as they're very tasty.

Holy cow! These are so good! They actually saved my job, (funny story but that's for another day) if you can believe that! Two little side notes:
1) I used my homemade yellow plum jam
2) I put them in the oven first BEFORE I put the thumb print or the jam on them for about 3 minutes. Pulled them out, they were PERFECT to work with (thumb print and then the jam) /no spillage! That (burnt jam) can ruin a cookie. Then I returned them to the oven for 10 minutes. Perfecto! Oh, real quick, keep the dough cold and use the TBSP to get perfect, consistent amounts of dough for each cookie. Voila!

Very tender and buttery. I made them with raspberry jam and they were delicious! They make closer to 2 dozen cookies though, which in my case is great, because I don't need to eat that many cookies!

Wow, these were gobbled up in no time.  The recipe made 32 cookies.  Think I'll double the recipe next time.  Besides being such a pretty cookie, they were absolutely a cinch to make.  So thankful for this recipe!

I'm not sure what I did wrong. I was skeptical of no eggs or baking powder but I followed the recipe exactly as directed and ended up with VERY flat cookies. They still pretty good. Also I only got about 30 cookies from this recipe.  I made the balls exactly one inch in diameter.  I'd like to know what I did wrong because this has so many good reviews, I'll probably try it again.  My house was not humid at all, if anything it's extremely dry so I don't think that is the problem.

Absolutely lovely!!I'm working on my cookie platter and trying to finalize the cookies that ought to go on the platter...and this one's definitely going on the platter!!
Oh and raspberry preserve won hands down!
I made one batch as is, and a second batch with a pinch of salt and half a teaspoon of vanilla in it! I preferred the second batch.
It took me about 25 minutes to get it golden brown...as against the 15 minutes mentioned.
Oh and I do think orange preserve would go wonderfully with this...simply to add a bit of tang!!
UPDATE:19/12/2009:I made these with bonne mamman four fruits of the forest preserve, also a really could combination for these. These are going on my christmas platter this year too!

These are good, but the first time I made these they were really buttery, but every time after that they haven't tasted as good. I'm not sure why. They are very pretty though.

WOW! These are fantastic cookies! My son and I made a half-batch before dinner tonight, and by bedtime they were all gone. We added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and, since the dough was rather crumbly, 1/8 cup milk. We used blackberry jelly. We baked them for 15 minutes, until they just began to turn golden on the edges.  Absolute perfection, and so simple, and they don't require any unusual ingredients so we can make them anytime.  Yum!

By the way, a half-batch yielded about 18 cookies.

These were amazing and got rave reviews from everyone who tried them.  I used strawberry preserves as the filling with smashing results.  Just be sure your butter is very soft.  Mine was still a little chilled and my first batch of cookies didn't hold the thumbprint very well; however, the batch I made with very soft butter came out perfectly.  They're my new favorite late night snack, paired with a glass of milk!

Very good cookie recipe. What I really like about it is how quick and easy it is to prepare and bake.  This is a great recipe if you need something quick.  I took them to work, and they were a big hit.

My mom made these all the time for Christas growing up...so I thought they would be great, but indeed this is not the same recipe!!  The batter when baked tastes too flour-y...the only savior was my strawberry rhubarb preserves and some icing made from confectioner's sugar and water...I'm sorry.  I hate leaving bad reviews, but this turned out to be a big flop and I will never make them again.  Oh yea, and as far as making 72 cookies??  No way...I ended up with 28 and I followed the batter recipe to a T and even used a 1-inch diameter scooper to shape cookies.  An obvious error.

Loved them, fast and simple, great for potlucks, parties, gifts, anything really. Will be sure to use these all year round. I may cut back just a little on the flour next time, dough was a little too flaky, but after kneading a while it came together quite nicely. Also added a little bit of vanilla after reading the reviews.
Thanks!

Super easy to make and bake!  I cooked mine for about 10-12 minutes and they were perfect.  I used just a tad less unsifted flour and added some vanilla and the flavor is great!  I also used homemade triple berry jam on them.  I used a stone to cook them on and the Pampered Chef melon baller to size them.  Then I made the thumb print with a baby spoon.  Each cookie received about 1/4 t jam and very few had spills.  I got about 36 cookies from the recipe.

I could not believe how good these turned out!  The only thing I changes was adding a bit of vanilla.  Next time I will use a little less flour because the dough ended up too crumbly.  They were still amazing and I will make these over and over!!

What an excellent tasty cookie, and attractive too!  Smells wonderful!  I am SO happy I found this recipe.  After destroying a cookie batter earlier today, I found this simple recipe on this site and gave it a try.  It's so easy and fool-proof I am amazed!  I used Polander raspberry seedless spread and I barely put 1/3 tsp in every cookie.  I did a half recipe and it made exactly 25 cookies, only 2 of those cookies had jam runoff.  THANK YOU so much for this recipe because A) it's simple B) it doesn't have eggs of which my husband is deathly allergic, C) it's Swedish (which my husband will love being part Swedish) and D) now I have a perfect recipe for Christmas dessert! :)

Excellent. Easy recipe, makes lots of cookies. The texture is flaky and buttery. My daughter isn't crazy about jam, I think you could just leave it out or press a nut in the middle instead.

Delicious shortbread cookie with jelly. Mine spread out a little more than I would've liked, which caused jelly to ooze out of well in some of the cookies, but they were very good cookies just the same.

I made these with King Arthur gluten free flour. They are fantastic. Followed others suggestions to us a 1/4 teaspoon of jam per cookie. Found that was the perfect ratio for raspberry jam, but too little when using cherry jam. the only change I may try is either a little less butter or a little more flour or maybe some xanthan gum. I found they spread out more than I was expecting probably because of the lack of gluten to hold it together.

I make these every Christmas, and I've been using this particular recipe for at least 3-4 years now. They're one of my personal favorites. They're so buttery and the topper of jam completes them flavor wise and also looks pretty. Try them warm out of the oven. They'll keep and they're delicious at room temp, but they're amazing when warm.
One last thing - these are also ridiculously easy. Anyone at any baking level can make these

I made several batches last week - no substitutions - no changes.  Perfect.  I just made another batch because I found another jam I wanted to use and they spread out, and are basically lace cookies with a plum jam smear in the middle!  I do not know what happened?!!  Anyone have this experience, know what might have gone wrong?

I made it exactly as written  I sifted the flour and then measured.  2 cups didn't quite bring the dough together so I added a bit more, maybe a tablespoon.  It was still slightly less total than 2 unsifted cups.  The only thing I varied, was setting the ready-to-bake cookies on the porch, it was 30 degrees out today, while I waited for the oven to preheat.  They chilled, but didn't freeze in that time.  They baked perfectly and look exactly like the picture.  Very simple to make, I had all ingredients on hand.

Made these today (with the addition of a pinch of cinnamon and a little strawberry extract)! They came out perfect, and didn't spread like other thumbprint cookies tend to. They aren't overly sweet, and can even work as a more savory butter cookie if you aren't feeling like adding jam.

I have made these more times than I can count, as an addition to  Christmas cookie tins or for just any occasion - they are perfect nearly every time, with any variety of jam.  They are very easy to put together and, as long as you don't go overboard on the jam, come out pretty nice looking.  They are buttery and delicious - if "buttery" equals delicious in your book.  Highly recommend these as they are really tasty and simple to make.

These are kind of addictive. It doesn't help if you make them each the size of a toonie. Additionally, pretty much anything goes well as the topping. I often fill them with custard. As these are time sensitive, it pays to know the nature of your oven. Mine is usually 25 degrees hotter than it states, for example :/

Add a dash of vanilla extract for more flavor. Ligonberry jam is fairly traditional, but difficult to find in the US. It's almost like a milder cranberry flavor, and the tartness cuts the sweetness nicely.

Very good, but  felt it needed the tsp vanilla recommended by another reviewer. Used a heaping 1/4 tsp preserves per cookie - that's what makes these so good!  Made 40 cookies, baked for 13 minutes.  Also, I tried both with and without rolling in walnuts, and preferred them without.

Best thumbprint cookies I ever made. I lost my previous recipe and was reluctant to try this one because it only had 3 ingredients. Wow , I was pleasantly surprised!! However, I like putting the preserves/jelly on AFTER the cookie is made.  I think baking it dulls the taste of it. Try this, you won't be disappointed.

Best thumbprint ever. I only had grape jelly, so I made apricot filling from dried apricots for half of them. The dough held together well, I didn’t sift, just spooned and leveled the flour. The perfect tasting cookie as far as I’m concerned.

I made it and it was delicious 
  When I  was a child in the Berwyn  Illinois  neighborhood  my  aunt and her mother of Bohemian  Czech descent would make this with my mum and myself
This was a Czech  version of kolaches.    We would use creme cheese, poppyseed and other fillings in the center of the thumbprint.  Then lightly  dust with powdered sugar.     We couldn't  make or eat enough..
 Such a  special treat for all of us.  Yummy.Yummy

These are amazing! They are super light and buttery. I used raspberry jam and they were delicious. To make the thumbprints, I used the back of a teaspoon measure and that way they were all even. They turned out great,  none of the jam spilled over.

Drizzled white or semi-chocolate stripes on top for extra flavour profile. A lot of compliments.

Don’t overwork dough or you will activate gluten resulting in a tough cookie. Crumble mixture with fingers, creating pea sized pieces. Roll expeditiously using heat of hand.  There’s never too much jam - make deep well with floured fowl tool.

Bake on parchment paper. If the butter is escaping when baking leaving flat cookies, roll dough ball in flour before adding jam, then baking. Keeps shape and height.

Love this cookie! So easy to make and tastes so delicate. A great cookie to make with kids because there aren't too many steps and they get a kick out of making the indent with their thumb. Dip the thumb (or whatever you use to make the indent) into powdered sugar to prevent sticking. 

I used a half tablespoon to measure out the dough before rolling and ended up with 50 cookies. The jelly was 1/4 tsp into every indent. I did add a splash of vanilla as others have suggested. I didn't have any almond extract but I think 1/2 to 1 tsp almond extract would also be a welcome addition. 

Baked for 10 minutes. After the first batch, I sort of flattened the cookies a bit with a drinking glass bottom dipped in powdered sugar before filling. The first batch I did not flatten and they looked bit like lumps -- delicious lumps but still lumps.

super easy for light, buttery goodness.  I added some vanilla. the cookies do spread, so next time, i'll make a bigger "thumbprint" for more jam.

Yum! The shortbread has good flavor- I added a quarter teaspoon of vanilla because I saw a few reviews that said the flavor was a little off. Turned out great! This makes a heck of a cookie!!

I liked them but though the cookie needed a little flavor, should have maybe used flavored extract as some others had. I used blackberry spread and I think would have been a little better with jam. Overall a good cookie.

Wow ! This is one of the most delicious bars, or for that matter, any kind of dessert I’ve ever had, or made. Honestly. I followed the recommendations to increase the flour in the base and double the caramel. I used milk chocolate chips, which made it amazing but semisweet would also be incredible. With the milk chocolate chips the bars taste like Heath bars. I left out the pecans because we have but allergies in the family. I will be adding these to my Christmas cookie trays. Thanks !

Yes,  I will make these delicious gems again.  Maybe next time I will make them as 2 inch balls rather than the 1 inch.  I am sure the Swedes won't mind.   I used Strawberry and Blackberry jams as the filling and found that the Blackberrry  consistency held together better than the Strawberry.  In the future I will try Apricot jam.  The dough seems to hold together better after resting a few minutes and that made better looking cookies.
My yield was about 72 cookies at the 1 inch measure.

For a  simple, 4 ingredient recipe, these cookies are unbelievably scrumptious!!!  Some reviewers say they added vanilla extract but you do not need anything other than the butter, flour, sugar and jam!!!  With those ingredients the flavor is awesome!  I used organic, unbleached flour , unsalted butter, sugar and for the filling I used my favorite organic strawberry fruit spread which is a jam texture.   I used a bottle stopper (reusable cork) with a round,  flat, smooth plastic  bottom on the stopper and it made the perfectly sized, uniform indentations to place the jam into.  Just don't overfill so they don't bubble over in the oven and make a messy looking cookie.   Keep an eye on the cookies while in the oven as you only want them lightly browned around the edges and not over-browned/overdone.  Mine were done in under 14 minutes. They melt in your mouth with a burst of deliciousness. My DH says this is his new favorite cookie!  They are so simple to make and  just so delicious!!!

Absolutely delicious. Made only half of what was said. Added 1 teaspoon of the Vanilla.
Made these a second time and instead of jam, I added mini chocolate chips to the dough, formed those into balls and cooked for same time and temp. They were delicious!!

Beautifully simple recipe. Made it as written, but added a splash of almond extract. I made these for Valentine's Day, so I used a small candy heart to make the indentations. Done to perfection in 12-13 minutes.

Made the cookies yesterday and they were a huge hit. This morning my husband told me never to make them again because they were too delicious. Recipe made about 30 cookies. I did add 1 tsp. of vanilla extract per some of the other reviewers suggestions.  Contrary to my husband's wishes, I will make them again. I may just have to hide them from him ;) Thank you for a delicious recipe!

These were amazing! I made them for Christmas and they were a big hit. I used seedless raspberry jam because it had the brightest color.  They came out beautifully.  I followed the recipe exactly,   totally delicious and buttery.

I will definitely make these again. I used raspberry and strawberry preserves, that I also removed the seeds from. I followed the recipe to almost a T, but I did incorporate 3/4 tsp of vanilla extract into the dough mix, which I feel may not have even been needed. These coookies are light, fluffy and are plenty sweet enough. My only recommendation for the cooks that complained the cookies were flat, the butter can't be completely room temp, or the dough needs to be refrigerated for a bit. Any cookie that has butter in it, you need to keep th dough on the chiller side. Well done recipe with such little ingredients!!!

One of my most favourite cookies ever! This recipe is amazing, and they go especially well with a cup of tea. Mine didn't turn out as neat as the picture, probably because I got a little greedy  with the dollop of jam. But they taste wonderful all the same!

*Sounds like sifting the flour on these really makes the difference, so be sure to do so!

Incredibly simple and so delicious. These are melt in your mouth. The trick seems to be small cookies with deep wells, and refrigerate dough between batches. Very little issues with spreading. Tender, buttery, melt in your mouth bites. Yumm

This is one of the most convenient cookie recipes I've ever found. It's made with with 4 ingredients that are household staples and, I think, are usually on hand. I did add some vanilla extra and a little bit of cinnamon to mine. A tip that I think may help others is to know that you need to use a mixer to fluff the butter and sugar but you then mix the flour in with your hands, not the mixer!!!
I love this recipe. It will definitely be used again soon!

I made my cookies too small and with too much jam, but  they are so easy to make and delicious too. Delicate and crispy and light shortbread cookies, with just enough sweet (I used apricot). I know now to make 'deeper' thumbprints, so the next batch will not only taste great but they'll look great too. EDIT: I made a small batch of these for a diabetic: used Splenda for sugar and no-sugar-added jams for the filling. It was a hit!

I tried this out tonight to see if I should make it part of a cookie assortment I'm planning for Christmas.
It made the list!
I didn't make too much of a change but after reading reviews here's what I did.
First, I only made half the recipe so my husband and I couldn't go crazy eating cookies. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla.
As for the sift/no sift before/after question, I decided to sift and then measure even though my flour was probably already pre-sifted (I no longer have the bag). I added  it in gradually so I could have more control and actually ended up using all of it.
I chilled the dough for about 20 - 30 minutes.
I used what other reviewers suggested, a Tbsp for the cookie dough and 1/4 tsp for the indentation & filling.
I used strawberry fruit spread.
I got 13 cookies  for 1/2 recipe.
I baked at the temperature in the recipe, checked after 10 minutes, and then gave it another 5.
Perfect! I'm making these for Christmas!

As a new baker, I found this recipe to be easy.  I started baking to ensure my daughter, who has nut allergies, could eat the things her brother can eat.   Others have commented not to put too much jelly and I would recommend that as well.  The jelly will boil over and create a mess.  I used strawberry and apricot for this recipe and both turned out great.

I adjusted for altitude by adding 1/4 cup of flour. I also used the idea of a measuring spoon to make the bowl (1/2 tsp), and filled with 1/4 tsp of blue berry and lingonberry jams. The cookies didn't run, and they taste great, but were too well done at 12 minutes. ( I also added a splash of vanilla and some almond extract. I rolled the balls in a course sugar for an extra festive look) I'll make them again, but will try baking at a lower temperature for less time.

Delicious!  My family's favorite cookie.  Thank you for the perfect recipe.  
The trick to get the light and puffy cookie is to really whip the heck out of the butter and sugar before you add the flour.

Amazing. I tried making them with gluten free flour and they are amazing! The are very tasty with tea and have a slightly "dusty" texture. Will definitely be making these again soon.

Nice and easy! And delicious! I made these for a Swedish crayfish party here in MN, and they were a hit and got eaten all up. I am originally from the South, so naturally I replaced 2 TBS of softened butter with softened bacon grease. Oh lordy, so, so good. I also didn't have any jam so made a quick jam using approximately 1 qt puréed strawberries, 1/2 c. sugar and 2 TBS lime juice. I will be making these buttery beauty again.

I read many of the reviews and added almost 2 tsp of almond extract when I felt the dough was too dry, and tried one batch rolling the balls in crushed/finely chopped walnuts before dimpling and adding preserves. They came out perfect both ways, everyone loves them and it's hard to stop eating them. This recipe is a keeper.

This is a really good cookie and I loved it! It was a little hard to make because it has to be compact into little balls and I didn't make it as compact as it should have been so the cookies just fell apart in the oven, but the still tasted amazing!

Love this cookie!!  I made this on a whim one night and it came out perfect.  The only substitution I did was using vanilla extract instead of almond (because I didn't have almond at the time).  I also, sprinkled on powdered sugar once the cookies cooled, but it was more for presentation, then for taste.  Keeping this one in the box.

Really really great! I was home, craving something sweet to eat, and found out that I'm out of eggs. So I thought I was out of luck, but then I came across this recipe. I used my Knotts's seedless raspberry and strawberry jam. I also tried Nutella in the middle of a couple of them. Saving this recipe for sure!

These were excellent and easy to make. The cookie stays light and buttery and puts canned imitators to shame. I made a batch and tried different fillings. Strawberry preserves and ginger peach were two that came out really good.

Added the vanilla (much needed), chilled the dough for 1/2 hour, used a measured 1 Tbl and used red raspberry jam.Didn't have any trouble with spreading 'coz of the chill, I think. 10 min. bake time was too little 12 came out great. Came out very nice but only got 27 cookies. The powdered sugar suggestion was a great one. These aren't as short as I thought they'd be.

SO good.  I made by cookie hole big, thinking that the more jam the better.  That was the wrong thing to do  because they  spread a bit, which wasn't a problem other than I didn't put enough jam in (so I added jam AFTER they  came out of the oven and nobody knew the difference!).   Nevertheless, the dough was DELISH and I will SO make these again.   Super easy recipe.

This cookie was so easy to make, but pretty to look at.  Tasted so good.  I agree with other reviewers that the apricot and raspberry were the best filling.

I don't know how you could possibly get 72 servings out of this recipe, as stated. Other than that, this recipe is perfect in every way. These are my favorite cookies! My daughter brought them to a cookie exchange and, of course, the other mothers wanted the recipe. I was a little embarrassed to admit how easy they were to make and how few ingredients were needed. So many people dismiss recipes, because they think they need to be more complicated. These cookies TASTE incredible! That's all that matters.

Such a great cookie! I wanted to try something new this year. I am so glad I doubled the recipe as I ate half befor I could give them away. So simple to make. I used a 4 berry jam that was perfict for these. I will be making these a lot as so many people asking for them now. I did add just a pinch of salt and a lil vanilla makes them perfict. Not sure if it was the size I made them or just my oven I had to bake them just a little longer. 17 min was just right.

I'm used to making the thumbprint cookies that you roll in crushed walnuts but these are good too.  They are much lighter than the traditional thumbprint cookies.  They are airy and make a great Christmas cookie. I did add a small amount of vanilla for extra flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

It taste so good! It was my first time making it and it was a success. But next time, I would put less sugar because the Jam filling I used was already sweet. I put 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla extract for flavour.

These are delicious!  We made them with lingonberry preserves from ikea and, with the buttery cookie flavory, it combines wonderfully.

this cookie is DELICIOUS..I did, however, add the 1/2tsp of vanilla. Mine didn't look all pretty and puffed up like the pic? But, I'm pretty sure it's something to do with how much you handle the dough.. because the balls that I fussed with a lot are flat vs the ones I just rolled into shape look fine. Also, MAKE THEM 1" BALLS. Scrimping on the dough will also make for flatter cookies, more like the lace cookies. These taste very much like the Danish cookies in a tin (Probably not Danish, I know) but this is the best way I can describe. I used Triple Berry Preserves, used a baby spoon to put a tiny bit in the thumb hole and then a little bit more when they got out..and my parents won't stop eating them. I'll TOTALLY be making these again!!

I replaced ¼ cup of butter with vegetable shortening, and added 1 tbsp. of water while whipping, plus 1 tsp. of almond extract and the vanilla from 1 fresh vanilla bean. I used home made blackberry jam. Delicious results! Oh, almost forgot... dusted with icing sugar while cooling on baking trays.

Yum! Love it with a tsp of almond extract and apricot jam. Great with a cup of tea.

Had a last minute need for cookies, and had the ingredients for these in the pantry.  Made as written other than adding a teaspoon of vanilla.  Perhaps my concept of a 1 inch ball is different from the authors, but I only got 23 out of the recipe.  I used a teaspoon to make the thumbprint and filled it with a scant 1/2 teaspoon of jam.  Used Smuckers triple berry with honey jam.  Turned out absolutely delicious.  I would have no qualms making these again - I'm hoping we can stop eating them long enough to take to the party!

Gluten Free and really good. I halfed the recipe to try out GF for my daughter and I. I used brown sugar (cause I love brown sugar) and Namaste prefect flour blend. I also followed other post advice about sifted flour, I sifted my flour into a measuring cup until filled, not the other way around. I also used a tablespoon for my cookie size and a 1/4 tsp. to make the dimple. hope this helps.

Delicious! So quick and easy to make. I put too much preserves in the middle so they did spread. Will put less next time. These are moist, airy, not too sweet, not dry, all over an awesome cookie!

I love these cookies!! But every time I make them I get 20 cookies not 72. I must be making them too big. It says to roll the dough into 1 inch balls. So I do but never makes anywhere near 72 cookies.

These cookies are a dream.  They only have 3 ingredients and make a ton, what more could you ask for?   Just be sure to put only a small amount of jam....almost what you would think is not enough....and that will keep it from spilling over when baked.  I have used Apricot jam, Strawberry jam, and Raspberry jam.  I have to say I think the Raspberry is my favorite.  Follow this recipe exactly and you will get perfect cookies.

I put all the ingredients in the food processor for a minute and the dough was perfect, not too crumbly or sticky. I did not sift the floor. I used a melon baller to measure dough and got around 60 cookies. For something different I topped 1/2 the recipe with small pieces of chocolate peppermint bark when they came out of the oven (instead of putting jam).... Both are a melt in your mouth wonder!! ;-)

Awesome cookies,  super easy, nice and light.  Loses 1 star because the recipe says it makes 72 cookies.  I had to make 2 batches to get 72 cookies.

Great, very simple recipe. Fine as-is if you want to show off your jam, but I prefer to add a pinch of sea salt and a package of fancy toasted coconut, then use pineapple jam. People LOVED it both times. I also made this as bar cookies in a 9x13 pan once when pressed for time, and they turned out very well. Press into a lightly greased pan and spread with jam if you're feeling lazy!

Well I did and they turned out beautiful, I did add the vanilla, My jam was a surprise, I didn't have any . You those cranberries you get from the food bank. A big 30oz bag, I set them in a quart pot and let them soak until they pulped out. Then I put 2  cups sugar , made sure the pot was filled with water and did a high boil on them , 2Tbs sifted cornstarch, and 1cup of molasses, 1tbs of lemon juice to preserve color and the jam.  After it was a thick consistency ,like jam. The cranberries were big, so I put it all in a blender on  pulse Just thick enough. Some I put in the cookies and some I jarred ok, Beautiful and good, You'll see them on my Facebook page Donna R Agnew, Christlandhouse Bountiful Living. Creativity

Wow! Amazing! I added 1/4 more sugar as I have a sweet tooth. Also, my oven is probably warmer than most, so this next batch I'm putting them in for 15-17min. Enjoy!

The cookies are really lite and buttery, and the simplest you can think of. While  shaping , the cookies were craking on the edges, may be i messed up a bit with the dough's  consitancy. Also it is prone to get burnt if you keep it ny longer than 12-13 mins. The cookies were all gone before i could grab some more! Doesn't evn need the jam!:-D

The recipe is awesome as written. The second time I added vanilla and they were even better! I made these for Christmas gifts and everyone loved them. My one complaint is, like others, I didn't get anywhere near 6 dozen cookies out of this. I got almost 3 dozen. I found the secret to keeping it light and airy was to make sure to cream the sugar and butter really well before adding other ingredients. My daughter made a batch and didn't flatten them. When they were still warm she rolled them in powdered sugar. YUM!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to cut the cooking time down to about 13 minutes or the bottoms got too brown. I loaded each with cherry Solo pastry filling. Yummy!

I am so happy i found this recipe. I stopped making these cookies when i lost the recipe. Now i can bake these again this coming Chinese New Year. I called these cookies " Bright-eyed Susan". I usually coat the balls with chopped nuts( of your choice) before making the indentations in the centre. And i put the jam after i took them out from the oven. They were the favourites of my family and guests. Thank you for the recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, however my dough was very crumbly, not sticky like other reviewers have stated.  I would form it into a ball, place it on the cookie sheet, and it would crumble to pieces.  I tried to refridgerate the dough for a bit, but that didn't help.  After many attempts I was able to keep the dough in ball shape (had to make indentation while dough was still in my hand), fill and bake the cookies.  After baking they did hold their shape, and the flavor was very good.  My husband really enjoyed them.  I think if I make this recipe again, I will follow another reviewers suggestion and press 3/4 of the dough into a fluted tart pan, spread with preserves, and crumble the remaining 1/4 of the dough on top and bake.

Easy & good.  I even overcooked a bit, but just put more jam in the center after they were baked.  Perfect!

Worked perfectly... My family couldn't stop eating them.  I did add some extra flour to make the dough more stable and slow down the spreading issue.  I also made bars by covering the baking dish (13x9)with dough and then spreading globs of raspberry jam over it.  I sprinkled dots of remaining dough on the top and baked it for 25 mins.  The cookies  came out prettier when I made them really big ( about a lg choc chip cookie size) but I will make bars instead in the future...much easier.  Great recipe!

These are awesome!!! My hubby doesn't like many sweets but he loves these & I've been searching for the "right" recipe for a long time. These are good as-is, but personally I'm adding about 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the batter, makes them extra yummy! For added sweetness/decorative flair, make a drizzle out of 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp of almond & enough milk for drizzling consistency. Pretty AND super tasty. Very easy recipe. Oh, another poster's advice to make easy thumbprints is the best: use a teaspoon to make the dents, then use level teaspoons of jam to fill - you come out with the perfect amount & if your "thumbprints" are evenly done, you won't have any jam spillage. LOVE THESE!!!

KEEPER! Simple and delish, of all the Christmas cookies I made this year we liked these best. Like some of the other commenters here I found that the recipe didn't yield 6 dozen.  I got almost 3 doz. I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract. Will make these again and again.

This is one of my go to recipes if I need cookies in a pinch.  I follow the recipe exactly, as this is the traditional Rosenmunnar- no need to alter.  I have used strawberry and raspberry jams. I have learned that making these cookies on a stoneware pan equals greater success then the traditional cookie sheet.  Also, do not over fill the thumb hole or it will boil over and make a messy cookie.  You will not get the 6 dozen it calls for, I am not sure if that is a mistake or wishful thinking- I usually get 28-31 cookies.

First time making these and they are fun and delicious. Especially using my homemade summertime jams (Strawberry Rhubarb and Mint). I did follow Baricat's advice and let the dough rest 20 minutes before use. They came out perfectly round and light. Thank you for this recipe.

This is a new family favorite. I love that's only 3 simple ingredients plus the jam. The only criticism I have is that I don't think it makes 6 dozen. I got 3. Be careful not to put too much jam or it will run over the cookie.

I made a batch and a half of these. After these cooled and sat for a bit they were DELICIOUS!  Not a cookie you want to eat straight out of the oven.  I used apricot preserves, but next time will use something with a stronger flavor.

I did not sift my flour.  I don't know if that's what made the difference, but my dough was crumbles.  Even with 1/2 teaspoon vanilla all I tasted was butter and flour.  I tried to save my ingredients by adding onto it to make sugar cookies.

Delicious and easy.  I'm noticing a lot of reviews making suggestions about the amount of jam and size of imprint to avoid having the jam run over while baking.  I have found that different brands of jam work better than others.  To avoid the run-over problem I use Smucker's blackraspberry jam, it's consistant about staying where you put it and it's delicious!

Tasty and even easier than they look! I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the dough; it was very easy to work with, not too sticky, greasy or crumbly. I used low-sugar strawberry jam (not the kind with artificial sweeteners, just a lower sugar version). I used 1/4 teaspoon jam per cookie and got a total of 3 dozen cookies. That's half the number of cookies that the recipe states and less than half of the recommended amount of jam, but next time I think I'll make the reservoirs bigger (maybe 1/2 teaspoon if it's not too big) to get the proper ratio. They also only need 12-13 minutes in the oven, and would be seriously overdone if you made 72 and baked them for 20 minutes. Other than that, the recipe is pretty good.

These are an alright cookie, but they are very buttery. I made a 1/2 recipe expecting 3 dozen for a party, but only got 15 cookies. I used a cookie scoop too. So, the yield is kind of off. I used strawberry jam and dusted them lightly with powdered sugar after they cooled slightly. They looked festive, but I probably wouldn't make them again. Mainly because, I have had more flavorful shortbread like cookies.

I love these cookies!!!  I used to buy the cheap version of these at the store, had no idea how easy they would be to make.  These will become a staple in my cookie repertoire.  I did like others suggested and added 1 tsp of vanilla...either way, great, easy cookie.

THESE ARE THE BEST COOKIES EVER! I thought how could these be good? They only have 4 ingredients? Anyways I made them.I cut the recipe in half because i was still a little bit skeptical. I wanted a variety so i filled them with apple butter, apricot preserves, strawberry jelly, and grape jelly.I baked them for 14 minutes and  they were perfect! Hands down the ones with apple butter were the best. My grandpa tried one and instantly fell in love with them. Same thing with my grandma. She even asked me to make more of them for he coworkers as christmas presents. Everyone else in my family wants them as christmas presents also!

This recipe, to me, is fun to make! I had great success rolling the dough and then using either a 1/4 teaspoon or a 1/2 teaspoon metal measuring spoon dipped in sugar to make the indentations. (The larger equals more filling, obviously, and is my preference.) When I doubled this recipe and forgot to double the flour, I started adding flour blindly and ended up with a very firm dough. I made it again the following day and used the exact metric weight of flour. Out of the two, I think I preferred the recipe where I probably used around 2.5 cups of flour. Uncooked, the dough was crumbly but formed well and ended up holding it's shape a lot better. 

I ended up getting 40 cookies from a single batch using a 1 tablespoon scoop. I tried multiple jams, including seedless raspberry, cherry almond preserves, homemade concord grape, and cherry apple butter. The apple butter didn't set up as thick as the jams did, but it was the one that received the most compliments!

These came out perfect and my family loved them. I was worried at first that the dough wasn't going to hold, but it did perfectly. Thanks for sharing!

These cookies were so easy and simple to make, just be sure to make them very small because they will expand a lot while baking. If you make them to big, they will fall apart later on. Other than that, great recipe.

Wonderful! I added a touch of almond extract and used cranberry sauce, raspberry jam and pear jelly as fillings.

This is a great recipe to make. You can replace the jam with any type of jam. Do not use preservatives as they "melt out". My first time baking and it turned out awesome!

This is the third year I have been making them. This year I have 3 yo hands helping.  Perfect recipe to make with kids! As you read-you can't mess it up. And its the perfect way to use your home made jams and jellies ; }

Yummy!  Beware these are addicting.  They're light and crispy.  I also put 1 tsp vanilla in my dough.  I only got 32 cookies out of the recipe.  Maybe next time I'll roll small balls.

These are great! I've been looking for a plain (but delicious) thumbprint cookie. This is it. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 egg yolk, and an extra 1/4 c. sugar. Next time, I will cut back the sugar to the specified 1/2 c. I let the dough firm up for 30 minutes in the frige. No problems with spreading or overflowing. Done in 15 minutes. Yield: 28

What's better than 4 ingredients? + 1/2 tsp vanilla. Could tell from all the photos it is tricky to make the cookies look good. Mine were so-so but the yummy taste made up for that!

I was looking for a basic jam thumbprint recipe to compliment my homemade blueberry jam, and this is it!  So easy, yet so classic and delicious.  Also, love that this is a Swedish recipe as I'm making these for a coworker who is Swedish.  Funny coincidence.  Great, easy, delicious recipe.  Can't go wrong.

These were a HUGE hit at my house and so easy to make! Instead of using jam, I used (apricot, cherry, raspberry, and poppy seed) Solo brand pie filling.   The second time I made these (two days after the first batch) I used seedless raspberry jam for the filling. I must have filled the indentation too full because the jam ran out of nearly every cookie. I was disappointed because I had planned to give them away as a gift. I ate 'em instead - they were still delicious!

EXCELLENT!!!!! These cookies were easy and amazing! I saw that a couple people mentioned that the dough was really sticky, but I refrigerated it for a little over an hour and had no issue with it being sticky at all.  The only thing is that the recipe says it makes 72 servings, but it really only made about 40...double the recipe if you want more...I wish I had! These cookies are very yummy and I can't wait to serve them with my pumpkin rolls! Terrific recipe!!! Thank you!!!

My dough was crumbly, and the cookies didn't look nearly as pretty as the picture. When I put them in the oven, I figured they'd be duds. I halved the recipe and only got 9 cookies. Anyway, I took them out, and one bite had me hooked! I made them for an elderly friend, but now I'm not sure if he's going to get any!

These are so easy and delicious, and I will definitely make these again!  I used unsalted butter (as I usually do when I'm baking), but I think the next time I make these, I will use salted.  I think a hint of salt would be a nice addition.

The easiest, most foolproof cookies ever.  Simple and inexpensive to make in great abundance, and you don't even need the jam.  Just shape them into ovals, mark them with a fork and you've got leaves!  Everyone loves them!

This was delicous!  I couldn't believe it tasted so good with such small ingredients, but all I added was some vanalla, and I made it with all kinds of jams, I brought them to work, and they were gone in minutes!  Thank you!

These cookies are extremely easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I made them last Christmas along with a bunch of other favorites and these were the hands down favorite of everyone. Ironic since they were also the easiest to make.

Yummy! I rarely bake, but with such a simple recipe using just a few ingredients I will definitely keep these around.  My beater decided not to function halfway through the creaming of the butter, so they weren't as light as they probably should've been, but they were still delicious.

My family renamed these "Oh my god!" cookies. Absolutely delicious. I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top and they looked just perfect. They're quick, easy, and disappear like that!

A traditional cookie that is an instant hit.  I have been asked to make this cookie for school, church, and family alike with even the pickiest eaters coming back for seconds.  I make these nice and small and take them out of the oven the moment they start turning golden brown.  My daughter's favorite filling is the strawberry but i have tried numerous jams with high praise.

I used whole wheat flour and probably shouldn't have. Also, I added an egg.  I think my s/o liked these more than I did since he practically ate them all in one sitting.  I used a European berry mix preserve that suited the recipe really well.

I love these cookies. I look through every recipe and often question 5 star ratings. BUT this is one 5 star that deserves a plus! It's easy, buttery and good. Perfect for the holidays. Since you can adjust the topping/filling, you can personalize then cookies to your taste. Will make again and again. Amazingly easy.

SO good.  I made these cookies for a friend on her birthday.  I am not what you would call a "baker,"  so the simplicity of this recipe appealed to me.  Super easy, buttery and delicious!  I used raspberry preserves in mine.  There were none left at the end of the night.

Sinful-- really-- that much butter must be illegal :) If some of you are having trouble with the flour, you MUST remember to sift the flour. The first time I made these, they came out like hockey pucks because I didn't sift the flour. Also, I find that the thumbprint turns out best when you roll the dough in to little balls, still your index and middle fingers in the top, and then fill the holes with jam. I have made these cookies several times not, and I found that NOT flattening them makes a better round cookies and a near perfect thumbprint. Enjoy :)

Such a lovely cookie.  I made them a little too big and was a little too generous with the jam, Homemade stuff, spewed over the sides.  Added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. YUM.  Great recipe thanks very much :)

Fabulous recipe. Couldn't be any simpler! I made these multiple times over the holidays with rave reviews from family & friends. The texture of these cookies is incredible - seems light and airy at the first bite, but they really do have a richness to them. My mom kept asking if they had cream cheese in them-- "Are you SURE you didn't use cream cheese?" It's amazing that the only ingredients are flour, sugar, and butter. I've used strawberry, raspberry, and apricot jams-- raspberry is definitely the winner. I find that using the end of a wooden spoon handle is the best for making the indentations, and I thank the reviewer who suggested using the ziplock bag technique for piping the jam.

I LOVED this recipe! It was so simple and fast.  I will be making these when I want to serve a special and beautiful treat.  They are such a pretty cookie.  You can be very versatile with flavors which is great.  I did learn the hard way that adding too much jam does not make a better filling --it makes a mess. These are great with milk or morning coffee too. Stick to the resicpe and you will have wonderful results!!

These cookies ROCK.  They are perfect- simple as can be and yet truly impressive, both visually and flavor-wise. I've tried this any number of ways, I love blackberry jam as well as raspberry jam.  I took another reviewers advice and used a small measuring spoon to both indent the cookies and then fill the spaces.  For this version I usually add a dash of both almond and vanilla extracts.  I also made a batch for Christmas using brown sugar instead of white and Nutella instead of fruit- A+++!!  Give it a try!

These are one of the easiest and best cookies I have ever made! With raspberry jam in the center, they were the perfect addition to the other holiday cookies I made. I did add a nice amount of jam in the center of the cookie and it worked out perfectly. Will definitely add this to my baking this no matter what time of year!

Just make them a little smaller than 1 inch in diameter, as they rise quite a bit. Also, make sure you really put a hole in the middle, otherwise, when it rises, it's cover itself up.

I just made this tonight and it was very tasty!  Very buttery and just right.  But the recipe says it makes 72 servings... That can't be right???  Did anyone else find that to be incorrect?  Other than that, I would definitely make this one again.

I'm only rating 3 stars because to me they tasted so buttery and that's not usually a complaint but for some reason I just don't think they have much other flavor.  They did spread but I can probably crumble off the brown edges.  For that much butter and fat I'd hope to get more cookies, but only 40 tiny cookies.  Next time I'll make something more interesting, but at least this recipe is very easy!

If I was given the option it would be 4.5 just because I added 1tsp of almond extract. Other then that they were very yummy! I used a tbsp to scoop up and roll them into balls and it gave me a total of 38 perfect little cookies. I pressed the hole really deep so the jam doesn't spill out. I also used a baby spoon to put the jam in, worked great cause its so small like the holes. I know I will have to make more of these little cookies real soon as I am giving away 3/4 of them to my husbands staff. Next time I might try skors pieces or even a chocolate mint in the hole.

Out of all my cookies that I had to make for Christmas, this was the easiest and a delightful treat!  Just make sure you watch them in the oven so you don't "burn" the jam and have the jam run over the sides of the cookies.

This may be my new favorite cookie.  These were delicous...so much so that I probably need to make another batch before Christmas.  A couple of things, though, just to warn people.  I did not get anywhere near 6 dozen cookies with this recipe.  My cookies were not large at all, but the recipe still only yielded about 3.5 dozen for me.  Also, I had chilled this dough before working with it, and I actually had to let it sit out for a bit and soften to be able to roll it.  I made some of the cookies with strawberry jam and some with citron jam (yuzu fruit spread from Trader Joes) and both were wonderful!

Edited to add:  I made these a second time, with lemon curd for the filling.  Wonderful!  I think in the future, I"ll make half of the cookies raspberry and half lemon.  They were great!

This is such an easy recipe.  And so good!! Everyone loves it.  I was able to easily double the recipe.  I also added "sugar in the raw" to the outside to make the cookies especially crunchy.

So delicious! I added some vanilla and used an assortment of jams and jellies - the jams work much better. The best one that I used was probably blackberry - SO GOOD!

These were so simple, fast and yummy!  Definitely does NOT make the amount stated, I doubled this recipe and still did not get any more than 3 dozen at the most.  My cookies spread out a lot, but they taste great.  They are the best when fresh out of the oven!  Loved them, Thanks!

I doubled the recipe and used 1 tsp vanilla. I also tend to make the cookies a little larger, so I ended up with 48 1.5-2" diameter cookies when I was done (with the recipe doubled). Because it was really humid here, I measured then sifted the flour. Also, because it didn't mention greased or ungreased pan, I used parchment paper, which was fine. I used the "simply fruit" smuckers red raspberry, heated in the microwave for 10 seconds to make it easier to spoon into the imprints. My 2 year old had a fun time pressing her thumb in each cookie (which I then had to make a little larger, otherwise it wouldn't hold much jam!), and she really enjoyed eating them when they came out of the oven. 

This is a new favorite recipe at my house, so quick and easy to make, and so pretty, even if they're not perfect! I'm sure my neighbors will enjoy these when we take them around this evening.

Great taste and so simple to make.  Made these with my 5 years olds.  We got about 40 cookies out of this recipe, and rolled 1/2 in crushed walnuts and left the other 1/2 plain.  We definitely preferred the plain half.  Sometimes less is more.  : )  I followed some of the earlier reviewers advice of using a clean chapstick cap for making the indents.  I also put raspberry preserves into a sandwich bag, snipped the end and piped in a small amount to the indent - worked perfectly and the kids loved doing this part.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll look forward to making these with the kids again next Christmas.  : )

This recipe was one of the easiest recipes I have ever made. Its a great addition to cookie plates because of its ease and colorful presentation. Not only are these easy and beautiful though, they taste great! I used homemade strawberry preserves and combined with the not too sweet buttery taste of the cookie they were awesome! The texture was very good too. The bottoms were nice and crispy but the jam kept the middles soft and chewy. Great cookie, thanks for the recipe; I know I will get tons of compliments on these and asked for the recipe!

I'm a big fan of baking for the fun of baking and giving all my goodies away (Lord knows they don't need to go to my waistline!) but when I made these cookies to give away for Christmas, I thought again!  They're too good!  I used raspberry jelly and refrigerated the dough for an hour or so before baking.

I really did enjoy making these with my 6 year old and 3 year old.  I probably should have thought twice about using the 3 year old's thumbprint...but he enjoyed it!!  I also added a tsp of vanilla and the cookies came out great!!

Thanks!

Great Recipe but only makes 3 dozen. You have to make the cookies very small or they spread too much. I also heated the raspberry jam in the microwave for 10 seconds, then was able to pour it into the imprints using a teaspoon. Worked perfectly!

Good cookie....and very easy and attractive.  Made them for myself yesterday, and then made 7 dozen today for a cookie exchange.  I would say that one batch makes about 40 (not the stated 72 servings).  Used seedless red raspberry jam.  Will add to my yearly christmas cookie list!

I made two batches of this for Christmas this year; the first batch didn't turn out so well, but I think the butter wasn't quite soft enough (the dough was really crumbly and didn't come together), the second batch was perfect. Both batches tasted fantastic; I made one batch with raspberry, strawberry and apricot jam (about 60 cookies), and the other batch I added rum extract and used butter-tart filling instead of jam. Great recipe, going in the recipe box and sure to become an annual favourite!

Delicious! I made these last night based on the few ingredients I had in the house. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. This will be replacing my mom's similar, but more difficult, recipe.

The only thing is that I got about 32 cookies, not 72.

These are UNBELIEVABLE cookies.  Really pretty idiot proof too.  Light, fluffy, delicious.  The key is in the "creaming" I think - make sure to get it nice and fluffy.  My hubby just said "I think those are my favorite cookies ever."  ONLY complaint is that they don't make 72 cookies and the cook time is off.  13 minutes was perfect.  And we got about 50 cookies and I had to make them pretty small.  Oh well just means I need to start a new batch!!!

Very tasty cookies.  I had a problem making them all pretty and round (they kept cracking around the edges!).  Even though they don't look as great as the pictures... I've made them several times already and they disappear in moments.

Great recipe, I made the mistake of bringing them into work and now I'm getting frequent requests for more. I also tried adding a bit of cocoa powder (and some extra butter) to change it up a bit, it worked quite well with the raspberry jam.

My daughters and I made these cookies tonight and they were a hit! They loved pushing their thumbs into the dough. We used the "jam in plastic bag" trick and I think it helped to keep the mess down. We used raspberry jam and only cooked for 13 minutes. I am giving only 4 stars because the yield of servings was only half of what this was supposed to make. We used a tablespoon for each cookie and only yielded 38 cookies. We will make these again and maybe roll them in coconut or crushed nuts for some extra flavour and prettiness :-)

Awesome cookies.  I made a half batch, which made twenty cookies, and used raspberry jam.  They turned out amazing.  My husband and kids loved them, which is amazing being how there was no chocolate in them.  I made two changes: I used margarine instead of butter and I added a half teaspoon of vanilla.  Definitely a cookie recipe to keep taped to the inside of the baking cupboard.

These cookies were a pleasant surprise!  Light and delicious with any kind of fruit preserve, jam or jelly.  I used both Strawberry and black current preserves. My fiance who hates cookies with any kind of fruit jam loved them.  I can't wait to give them as gifts :)

This is one of the most simple recipes that I have ever made, plus VERY good.  This will be a keeper in my recipe collection.  My kids love them because they can choose their favorite jam/jelly to place in the middle.  YUMMY!!!

These cookies are so good but for some reason, my cookies all had cracked. =( Don't know what I did. I used a Sweet Orange Marmalade (VERY GOOD) and homemade elderberry jam from my mother-in-law. Will have to try again later in hopes that cookie won't crack.

I love the Pepperidge Farm cookies and never found the recipe until now.  Excellent.  Changed nothing; used homemade plum jam.  Raves, nothing but raves.

This is one of my husband's favorite cookie recipes.  I always make them with seedless raspberry preserves or jam.  You can also use apricot jam.  These are so addictive!   Be sure to follow the directions and these will turn out excellent.  Do watch them carefully in the oven because once they start to brown, they can burn very easily on the bottom.

The reason I only gave this was a four was because I like a recipe that puts out what it says it does.  I only got 31 cookies out of this, which is about half of what it said you should.  I don't really think I made them too large, either.  In fact, I feel they are on the small side for a cookie.  The taste is wonderful and the kitchen smells great!

I made these cookies last year for my fiances family (who are Swedish) and they loved them. I used raspberry and strawberry jams and they turned out wonderfully. It is a simple, straightforward recipe that result in moist, tender and delicious cookies.

This recipe was fantastic, I really enjoyed it. It's cheap, quick and easy to make (not to mention yummy); what's not to love?

My favorite out of the jams I tried was apricot, and I imagine marmalade would be great for this recipe as well. I would definitely not recommend using blackberry, it makes the cookies way too sweet.

Delicious little cookies, and easy enough to make on a whim, as I did!  I added about a teaspoon of almond extract, and maybe another tablespoon of butter (accident-don't ask!) which may have helped avoid crumbly dough.  I used peach preserves and blackberry jam.  The peach preserves didn't have a lot of flavor, so you get more of the cookie-ness which was fine by me!  I also used a 1/4 tsp. measuring spoon to make the thumbprints and used that same spoon to measure out 1/4 t. or slightly less of jam and used a bamboo skewer to scrape the jam into the cookies, which worked well. I got about 48 cookies out of the recipe, and cooked them for 10 minutes.

Loved them!! I had just ruined a batch of peanut butter cookies I was planning to bring to a women's bible group. I used evap. Milk instead of sweetened condensed milk. It was 11:00 at night. What was I gona do now. so...... I went right up to the computer and found this easy wonderful recipe and I had all the ingredients. I made them and let me tell you I will keep this recipe for years to come. I used Orange, raspberry and blueberry jam so there is a nice selection. Can't wait to bring them this morning. I know there will be many compliments because they are delicious. Thanks for saving the day!!

I followed the recipe and baked the cookies for 15 minutes. It was perfect for my oven. I really like them, a very nice cookie. I used strawberry jam and made the well in the cookie using the end of a wooden spoon. I will save this recipe to make again.

My sister needed a Swedish recipe for a class project, so she made these and everyone loved them.  I've made them since then with great results also.  However, the cookies are pretty hard, which is my only gripe.  Maybe if I cut down on the sugar they'd be softer.  Besides, with jam on them, no one would be able to tell that I cut out the sugar.  Other than that they're delicious!

Quick, easy, and very yummy!  I didn't cook the full time either.  10-12 minutes is plenty of time.
