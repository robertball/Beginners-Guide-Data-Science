This was wonderful!  The salsa I used made it real soupy so I will drain the salsa next time.  I was out of taco mix and used fajita mix instead.  It was so good I don't plan on ever trying the taco mix!

My family thoroughly enjoyed this.  I followed Jen's suggestion and used thighs instead of breasts.  Also followed another Reviewer's suggestion and used Fajita seasoning with excellent results.  Definitely needs 45 mins not 30 to thoroughly cook the potatoes.  And definitely drain the salsa but don't eliminate as this provides necessary moisture to steam the chicken to complete tenderness.

My picky husband and 3yr old liked it and said it was a keeper. I didn't do the sliced potatoes because I wanted baked potatoe that night, but next time I will try it with the sliced, and I just placed the chicken in a baking pan and covered tightly with foil instead of individually wrapping each one and it came out great.

Good basic place to start. Instead of individual foil packets, I layered it in a casserole dish. I sliced the potatoes as thinly as I could, but they were still not cooked all the way through after 60 minutes. Kind of like waiting for the scalloped potatoes! Same thing! I'd suggest poking them and microwaving them to give them a head start, then perhaps slicing them and continuing on with the recipe. Will probably make this again. :)

This is a winner with my family! We just make white rice instead of using the potatoes though, and then use the juices in the foil pack as a sauce for the rice. It's delicious! Even my picky three year old loves it!

This is a tasty dinner, good for weeknights since it is quick and easy.  My only complaint is that some of my potatoes didn't cook all the way. I tried to arrange them like in the picture, and the ones under the chicken were nice and done but the ones that were kind of on the sides were not.

Good for a quick fix dinner.  I used canned potatoes to make it even quicker to prep and had no problems.  I liked the salsa and taco seasoning on the potatoes as well.  Be carefull when unfoiling, the salsa creates a lot of liquid.

I made a few changes I think make it better. I did away with the tinfoil and potatoes. Instead I layered the bottom of a casserole dish with corn tortillas and I threw in some sliced yellow onion and it turned out awesome.

This was an easy twist on a recipe I make all the time. While I appreciated the quick/no clean-up for the baking pan, I wasn't wild about all the salsa juice on my dinner plate that had to be mopped up before serving. Give n' take, I guess.

Delicious and very easy to make! I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used boneless chicken thighs instead.  I didn't make it with the potatoes because my husband wanted french fries instead, so I can't comment on other people's bad potato results.

these were pretty good and very easy to make. the  things I did different after reading other reviews was to boil the sliced potatos for about 10 min. i also drained the salsa and made smaller chunks of chicken out of the full breasts & put 3-4 pieces on each pack. I poked 2 small holes on top of packs for steam to escape.after doing so I thought maybe they wouldnt cook right, but they did just perfect. I plan on making these when we go camping but cook them on the BBQ.

The family loved it! I took note of the potato's not cooking and fried them for 3-4 minutes before putting them in the foil. Worked out great. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good. We left the skiins on the red potatoes. Next time I might try diced potatoes or wrapping the chicken in tortillas.

Yummy! It took longer than expected to cook - I did a half hour on 400 then another half hour on convection bake.  I also didn't use the taco mix and I used low fat cheese and  omitted the sour cream to reduce fat.   The chicken came out great though!!

Not bad for such a quick fix! Next time I will lightly oil the foil first, as the potatoes and the cheese were stuck to it. 30 minutes is barely enough to cook it through, but 45 min was almost too much... Also, I will use a more spicy salsa, it came out too bland for my taste with the mild one, which was the only thing I had on hand. What I really like about this recipe is that I believe you can probably expand it and put lots of other things in you like, will try adding onions and sweetcorn next time, or maybe some jalapenos...

This is absolutely delicious! All I changed was adding seasoning to the bottom of the tinfoil and on top of the potatoes too. Such an easy recipe and the chicken turned out so juicy and the potatoes were perfect. This will definitely be a staple in our house.

It's such a simple recipe, but yet so incredibly delicious. I saw this recipe and I really like how you can make it your own. I used pepper jack cheese, some of the ranch dry packets, & smothered it in cheese. It's just a very fun and easy week night recipe! I hope you enjoy!

This recipe was wonderful. I made it almost exactly as written. I added peppers, onion and olives. I recommend cooking for a minimum of 45 minutes. Next time I'm going to try thighs instead of breasts as others have suggested. I made a special one for my pickiest eater who is 11. I didn't put the taco seasoning or peppers on hers. I used mild salsa, a little olive oil, salt and pepper and put on plenty of cheese. I only had sharp Tillamook cheddar on hand. This turned out so beautifully. I plan on making it again very soon.

The chicken was moist and flavorful, but the potatoes were a little on the bland side.  Next time I will season them more.  They were perfectly cooked though; maybe other reviewers didn't slice them thin enough. I sprayed the foil with Pam first to prevent sticking.  I also added a couple of slices of yellow onion under the chicken.  35 minutes at 400, perfect.

I make this all the time. I parboil the potatoes until they're just barely tender and then layer in a pan and cover with foil.

Very good and VERY easy for a quick weeknight dinner. I read a lot of people having trouble with the potatoes not being done so i took the chicken out of the oven 1/2 way through and just mixed the potatoes a little around the edges. It seemed to work because all my potatoes were cooked perfectly.
