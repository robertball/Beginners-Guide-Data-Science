These were absolutely excellent!  I will definitely make again.  I used leaf lettuce, and may try romaine next time - something a bit sturdier.  I also wonder how Belgium endive would work...

I have two vegetarians, and two meat eaters in the  family, so these were heaven.  Can make the filling with the veggies for one set, and with ground pork for the others, relish.
