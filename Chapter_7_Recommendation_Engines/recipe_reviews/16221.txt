This had a good flavor and was super simple...very good for busy weeknights.  For that I give it a 4 star! I took it a little further though by jazzing it up a little (aka... made it totally unhealthy/fattening but really tasty - eat in moderation!) by giving it a pinch or two of garlic powder, draining the juices and adding them to cream of chicken soup, a little milk, ground black pepper, adding it back to the penne in a casserole dish, put a mild, white grated cheese on top with a little bit of grated sharp cheddar to give it color... baked it until melted and bubbly. Yum. That made it a FIVE star.

This was a pretty good simple recipe that my family enjoyed (including my 2 year old).  I used smoked sausage instead of bacon, and added peas.  Both were tasty.  It could use a little more flavor, however.  I will probably add some garlic with the onion next time.  My husband liked it with parmesan cheese, too.

This was really good. I added small white beans. Spinach would be good also.
Quick and healthy-(use your own home-made chicken broth of course)

This was pretty bland but okay. Add some zing and it'd be way better.

I enjoyed the flavor of this pasta...but the bacon lost all of its crispness and became very limp after simmering in the broth.   Perhaps cutting the bacon into smaller pieces and only using half in the pasta - the other half as a garnish on top when serving would add to the texture and pleasing appearance of the dish.

Super easy and tasted good. Family liked it. Not a stellar, serve it for company kind of dish but a good basic easy weeknight dinner. I will certainly make it again.

Added cut up chicken breast to skillet with onion, and two cloves of minced garlic. After adding broth I added cut up zucchini. Another reviewer recommended spinach, which sound great but unfortunately I didn't have any. Husband loved it.

This was bland. The bacon got mushy.
