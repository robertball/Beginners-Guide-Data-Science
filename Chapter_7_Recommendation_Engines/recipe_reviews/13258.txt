Great starter! I didn’t have a veal knuckle so I omitted it. 
For a clear broth you must start with COLD water, if not your broth will be cloudy. Throw in a few cloves of garlic and some peppercorns. 
To control the sodium intake in a recipe wait on the salt until you are using the broth in a recipe. I have made broth in the crockpot overnight – makes for a wonderful, very clear broth.
