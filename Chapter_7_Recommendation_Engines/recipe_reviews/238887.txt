I'm giving this 5 stars because I believe as directed this will be awesome! I had to make some adjustments due to not having item in the ingredients. I used Dijon mustard for honey mustard and onions for the sweet peppers. All the rest was as directed. It was amazing!! I love it!

I completely changed the recipe and added a ton of other veggies to this. The sauce (sriracha, mayoe, & honey mustard) is what makes the salad. Basically it's a good sauce that could be added to various salads for that extra kick.

Easy, quick and great as a snack with crackers! I made with left over chicken I needed to get rid of, added more sriracha (Yes!!) and a little salt and pepper....yum!

A great refreshing salad. The perfect solution to a different tuna salad. This would go good on sandwiches or crackers. As a hot sauce lover I wouldn't go overboard with the Sriracha because it will overpower the brilliant flavors. Thank you alfons1313 for a keeper.

This is very good as written (though I did use bottled pepperoncini instead of "sweet peppers").  With the addition of some dried cranberries and some chopped cashews, it is even better.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was surprised at how much I liked this. I was very skeptical at how much sriracha was in the sauce (I'm not a big sriracha fan), but all the flavors worked well together. The taste was kind of addicting. I didn't have any mini peppers, so I replaced those with some diced red onion. I enjoyed the eggs in this salad too. Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly as written. It was really good, but had to add quite a bit less of the hot sauce as I can't handle much of that kind of thing.
