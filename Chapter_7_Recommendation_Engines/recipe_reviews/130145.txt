Made this for an office party and it was a HIT!  I made the first batch exactly as the recipe says.  I decided I needed to make more, but was out of Baker's chocolates so I opted to use Almond Bark (alternate brand of melting chocolate).  I think it turned out ten times better because it was more like bark and not so much like a candy bar.  Still used 6 vanilla:8 chocolate squares AND I put the peanut butter in with the chocolate so the white still looked white.

This recipe is really easy and well liked (even by those "I don't like white chocolate" people).  

I leave out the peanutbutter and use Trader Joe's peppermint Joe Joe's (their version of Oreos) for a minty flavor that's really great at holiday parties.

Very easy recipe to follow. I think that next time I will try it with the peppermint cookies or add some peppemint extract to the chocolates. I did leave out the peanut butter in this batch because I'm not sure everyone would like it. I'm planning to bring it to work so my co-workers can enjoy some homemade treats for the holidays.

Good recipie for those in a hurry and need a gourmet snack dessert- I like the idea that one user posted of using a mint oreo- definately would add some zing to this.  One caution when making these- make absolutely certain you use a microwave safe bowl- mine said "microwave warming only" and it resulted in an exploding bowl.  The chocolate gets way too hot in there.  Next time, I'll stove melt it.

Rich great taste! Would probably double the recipe as I didn't seem to get it very thin, but easy to make.

This was excellent. I loved the added PB and next time might use PB oreos with it. I also might try it with mint extract, tint it a little green and add mint oreos. Great!

We switched the semi-sweet chocolate for the unsweetened chocolate on accident. But, it turned out to be really good.

I make candy and take to my doctor's office for the holidays and his nurse always asks if I brought this candy.  It is great and so easy to make.  I do not measure the peanut butter, you can tell (after you have made it a couple times) by the color of the white chocolate if you have enough.

I made this for a cookie exchange at work and everyone loved it.  Next time I'm going to try it with only half of the peanut butter.
