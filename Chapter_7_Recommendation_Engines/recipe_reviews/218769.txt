Excellent!  A delicious, easy, healthy, and budget friendly one-dish meal.  I made it as written.  The flavors blended nicely and it smelled wonderful while it was cooking.   I cooked it on high for just under 4 hours and stirred it initially and then stirred one about half way through to blend everything and distribute liquid and had no problem with the chicken breasts drying out.   UPDATE:   I made this again and added red and green bell peppers and broccoli slaw to increase the vegetables and I doubled the spices except salt.  Since I increased the vegetables I decided to add another can of diced tomatoes and that was a mistake because then it added too much liquid.  I recommend not adding additional liquid even though it may look dry in the beginning because it makes its own sauce as it cooks.  Also, this time it seemed the additional liquid diluted the spices as it was not as flavorful as the first time even though I doubled the spices this time.   Next time I will add the additional vegetables but stick to 1 can of tomatoes and double the spices.   It is a delicious recipe.   If trying it for the first time I recommend following the recipe as written.  UPDATE II:  While eating leftovers of this recipe my husband declared this was the best dish I have made.  So it is a winner.

A very flavorful and healthy meal that's ridculously easy to put together. Next time will cut up the sweet potatoes a little smaller so they cook at the same rate as the remaining ingredients.

Great balance of flavor. This is one of the only ways I like sweet potatoes. The only change I would suggest is switching to boneless skinless chicken thighs. Simmering breast meat for long periods of time makes the chicken dry. I get that this is a stew but if you make the recipe with thigh meat you will notice a major difference in the texture and flavor of the stew.

This was an easy to make, very tasty, one-pot meal and my 'meat and potatoes' guys loved it..I didn't have fresh sweet potatoes, so I used canned, draining the syrup off first; no garbanzo beans, but we found great northern worked well..I added a pinch of  ground red pepper for zing and it worked perfectly. I just made it this evening, in fact, we just left the table 20 mins ago! Very good recipe! Thank you for sharing!

I made this today & it was delicious. I only had black beans & they worked well. I used 1/2 boneless skinless chicken & 1/2 skinless chicken drums but next time I will use all drums or thighs as the dark meat is so much more flavorful. I also added a cup of chicken broth.
A definite keeper...thanks for the recipe !

Slow Cooker Chicken Marrakesh Haiku: "In minority. This did not blow us away. Had to toss the rest." Unlike other reviews, we didn't really care for this dish at all. Easy enough to prepare (although I halved it for 2 adults and a child), but not well received at dinnertime. My daughter and husband picked out the chicken reluctantly, and while I ate a full serving, I found myself burping the flavors of it the rest of the evening, much to my stomach's dismay. Something about that particular combo of spices and ingredients just didn't sit right w/ us. Fun to try new things though!

I really enjoyed this quick and simple chicken stew.  I just threw the ingredients into the slow cooker last night, refridgerated, and had hubs turn on about 9:00 am this morning.  Slow cooked for about 8 hours before turning off and serving over rice.  I only used 1 lb boneless, skinless tenderloins, and did add some chicken broth when I got home as this was a tad on the dry side after that cooking time.  Loved the spices, I would definitely double them when making next time.  I just added them to the tomatoes and juice, mixed, and poured over the stew.  I also subbed black beans for garbonzos, just personal preference.  thanks for sharing this, KCOOPER!

This recipe was delicious! I made it as directed, except I put my chicken breasts into the slow cooker frozen (I think that helped keep them from drying out), and shredded them in the last half hour of cooking. Next time I'll double the spices, because it wasn't quite as flavorful as I was hoping for, omit the carrots, because it already has enough sweetness going on in the recipe, and add some fresh cilantro and a handful of raisins for extra flavor and texture.

Made this recipe as written, but also threw in some cilantro, since that appears in a lot of Moroccan dishes, and it was delicious. Be careful when serving though, because the sweet potatoes get crumbly and mushy. Served it with couscous, and they went well together. Even my boyfriend who doesn't generally like sweet potatoes enjoyed it!

My parents were going out for dinner tonight so I decided to make this for me and my brother.  I followed the tips that I read from other comments.  I doubled the spices, added half a cup of chicken broth, and used chicken thighs instead.  I served everything over whole grain brown rice.  Delicious!

I think that this might even make a really good soup!  just add a bit more chicken broth and you have yourself a flavorful soup that would be perfect for any chilly fall/winter night!

Why this is only a 4 star recipe I will never know. DH & I are floored! Absolutly wonderful mix of flavors. I did not have chicken breasts and used 4 thigh / leg quarters with the bone in and skin on. Cooked it for longer n the crock pot and WOW!!! Next time I will add more cinnamon and sweet potatoes. Other than that I would not change a thing.

I found this recipe to be bland. I substituted turmeric for curry. I also cut the recipe in half which was plenty for two. I added a little chicken broth to the crock-pot cause it appeared dry. I served it over white  rice.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was awesome. Like some others have said, I doubled the seasoning and added chopped cilantro. Served it over white rice with a side of fried plantains, and it was delicious! Definitely will make this recipe again.

This was very easy to make and tasted delicious. I served it with couscous, which was a nice addition on a cold autumn day. only change: I doubled the spices.

This is SUPERB.  I agree that is using chicken breasts, poach first and add during last 30-min.  Also, if you're using dried spices my crockpot recommends adding them toward the end.  I also add a handful of raisins.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Hope my suggestion regarding spices helps.

I adjusted this to make it vegetarian by simply leaving out the chicken and adding about 1/2 cup water.  I also leave out the salt since the canned tomatoes have plenty, and add a generou amount of red pepper flakes.  With a spinach salad, this is one my favorite things to make for a week of lunches.

This was so yummy and super easy to prepare. I was a little apprehensive because I have never cooked a Morrocan-style dish, but this is a great one to start with. I served it over couscous and my hubby raved about it! Also, it's even better the second day after the spices have really had a chance to blend together.

I followed this recipe exactly & did not enjoy the end result at all.  My hubby  (who eats almost anything) was kind enough to finish his serving, but my son (who also eats almost anything) reluctantly ate only the chicken, which was so very, very DRY.  Overall, the flavor was mild and yet really strange.  We love Moraccan, Indian & Middle Eastern foods -- food with unique & bold flavors -- but this just didn't cut it.  Total disappointment.

Very good! I used yams instead of sweet potatoes, added a dried Japanese pepper to the crockpot for heat, and garnished with chopped cilantro. It cooked for about 5 hours and seemed dry during most of that process, but eventually produced plenty of liquid and tender veggies. It makes a large quantity, and servings are generous for the calorie count. I might increase the spices slightly next time, but the recipe is pretty tasty as-is. I will prepare this again.

This was very good!  It could have used just a bit more zing.  I may try a little bit of chili powder next time.

After 3 1/2 hrs. the sweet potatoes were still hard as a rock.  Also, this recipe is very dry.  I had to add more liquid because the chicken was drying out.  Finished it in the oven.  After we all had our taste test, we concluded it wasn't worth the effort.  Sorry

Only just had enough room in the crock pot for this! A very easy recipe to prepare and leave. Smelt really good whilst cooking although the spices smelt pretty strong but I was surpised to find that it didn't taste overtly spicy (if anything it could have done with more spice). I found the chicken was a little bit too dry. Went back for seconds last night though and looking forward to left overs this week.

I made it for my pot luck party this past weekend. It was a hit!!! I made Goya spanish rice to go with it. They definitely go well together. Great flavor!! This dish was so easy to make! I couldn't fit all the sweet potatoes in the slow cooker, so I had to take some out  >

Very good! I probably would cook it on high for only 4 hours next time (5 hrs. dried out the chicken some). I used more cumin, turmeric and cinnamon than the it calls for as we like the taste of all these spices.

I followed advise from other reviewers such doubling the spices, adding chicken broth, and cooking on low 8 hours. This recipe did not blow me away. The consistency was fine, but the taste was lackluster even after doubling up on the spices. Probably won't make this again. Too much chopping for a 3 star recipe.

I tried this recipe today and really like it.  I added one tablespoon of garam masala to add a bit more flavor and it turned out really good.  I agree with the other people, it is a bit dry but still very tasty!  Also, I just cooked it on the stove top as I don't have a slow cooker.  I will definitely make it again.  Very good recipe.

this was very good.  I liked the flavors of the seasoning.  I think next time I will leave out the carrots. The sweet potatoes provided more than enough flavor

This was a delicious dish. I doubled all spices except salt per other reviewers suggestion and added about half teaspoon of garam masala. Used a can of Rotel as it was on hand. I used chicken breast with rib bones as they were considerably cheaper, and shredded at the end. This could easily be done with a whole chicken in a bigger pot. Also added about a cup or so of vegetable stock and thickened with corn starch. Added a big handful of chopped fresh parsley at the end instead of the dried. Served over basmati rice and garnished with chopped green onions. Cilantro old be wonderful with this instead of parsley. Definitely saved the recipe and plan to modify for vegetarian friends soon. The sweet potatoes did kind of fall apart. Would shorten the cooking time just a bit. I cooked on high for 4 hrs. Would check it at 3 next time.

Thank you KCOOPER78, and thank you Occasional Cooker. I did make changes as OC had, 1/2 red pepper, broccoli slaw, and doubled spices. Do not add more salt.
  I put a 13 oz can of Sams MEMBERS MARK Chicken breast, and 3 Italian sausages as my meats.
IT WAS DELICIOUS.....I added the sausages bec I had 3 left from pkg yesterday and needed to cook them soon. As it is, the meal was fabulous.
  Our family rated 1-10, this one is a keeper at 10.

I lived in Morocco for several years, and this recipe was reminiscent of stuff I had there.  As written, it was too bland.  I'd recommend doubling or tripling the spices, and adding more salt.  Good idea, though!

Easy and healthy dish to spice up chicken.  I've never had a Moroccan inspired dish, so I was skeptical as to whether or not I would like the flavors. I was pleasantly surprised. The only change I made, based on other reviews, was I added green pepper and I added about a 1/4 more spices than what the recipe calls for. I also served it with a side of Quinoa! As expected the chicken was dry, but I broke apart the larger chunks with a fork to give it a shredded quality which allowed the sauce to soak into it, making it seem less dry. LOVE the fact the recipe calls for Garbanzo beans and sweet potatoes, which are both very good for you. Also tumeric is said to have cancer fighting properties. Cooked it for 8 hours on low, next time if I can I'll try it for 4 hours on high like the recipe calls for.

I made this exactly as the recipe reads, except I substitute thighs for breasts, as I often do in slow cooker recipes. (breasts often come out too dry and tough).  I thought it was just okay.  I thought it would be more flavorful, but I found it kind of bland.  It also had too many "orange" root veggies.  If I were to try it again, I would use just one sweet potato, more tomatoes, and up the amount of spice.

I would have taken a photo of this dish, but it was GONE in a flash!  Helpful hints:  DO double the spices, and add a shake of cayenne if you are so inclined.  I omitted the carrots, but kept everything else the same...OK, except for adding some (1/2 cup) of chicken stock about halfway through.  The flavors were amazing!

This recipe wasn't bad but it was quite bland, which surprised me. I added some garam masala and coconut milk at the end to add more flavor and I added red pepper flakes to my individual bowl and served over rice. In the future I will sprinkle additional spices directly onto the chicken as it cooks.

I found this tasty and easy, and readily adaptable to a vegetarian version. Instead of chicken, I used 3 cups of texturized soy protein chunks, hydrating them with 3 cups of hot water and a packet of tamarind soup base. I used more garlic, turmeric, cumin and black pepper than the recipe called for, aiming for a bolder taste. Served on a bed of couscous, it was quite good. I can easily imagine adding artichokes or broccoli or cauliflower, and brightening with lemon yoghurt at the end (IOW, this is pretty tasty as it is, but also suggests itself as a starting point for interesting variations).

This was fantastic -- my husband and I both loved it, and even the 2-year-old ate a bowl! (The 4-year-old didn't, but he's like Mikey -- he hates everything.) I didn't need to add any additional liquid, though next time I may increase the spices a bit.

This recipe is perfect as it is written. It seems like the chicken version of a vegetarian African stew. Next time for company I will serve this with an assortment of Indian condiments along with brown rice.

This recipe was delicious!  I love to use my crock pot and this is a recipe that I will certainly use again and again.  My husband loved it and has "shot gunned" the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Only suggestion for improvement is to add a half cup of water in beginning and 2 tbsp of diluted cornstarch at end to make it a thicker sauce.   So good!

This was a solid 4.5. I have to mark down a bit because there weren't enough spices; next time I will double them. The chicken was tender and juicy. The tomatoes fit with the sweet potatoes. If your slow cooker is big enough, add more veggies. I did leave out the beans because my husband doesn't like them. Thanks Kcooper78

This was delish and I had almost everything required on hand, so it was so easy to make.  The only thing I didn't have was carrots; I used zucchini instead.  I also just used two chicken breasts.  My roommate loved it.  I was looking forward to the leftovers, but they were gone early the next day.

I don't like sweet potatoes but am trying to eat healthier so I was looking for recipes that included them as an ingredient.
This meal was fabulous, the blend of flavors was just perfect, nothing jumped out as being over the top. I made exactly as the recipe said and will do it again.  Because of this recipe I am seeking more recipes for sweet potatoes as they are an amazingly healthy vegetable.

Amazing!  I used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh to cut down prep time.  I also added a dash of red pepper flakes for a little kick.  We paired it with onion naan and rice from our favorite Indian Restaurant.  Usually we spend about $40 on a similar dinner for 2 people.  We have leftovers for 4 more servings.

Loved it! I added a few more sweet potatoes and I added about double the spices. At the end I also added some chicken broth and cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I served it over Couscous. My husband and I thought it was wonderful and healthy!

Great meal! Really simple to prepare and the sweet potato is such a nice touch! I added some cilantro and it was an excellent addition. Served this meal with a bottle of viognier and it was perfect!

I thought this recipe was kind of bland.  I normally love all kinds of ethnic food, but this just didn't appeal to me or my husband.  The garbanzos were still crunchy after 5 hours in the crock pot on HIGH.  Added 1 cup of chicken broth, as per other reviews, but the chicken still came out kind of dry.

Didn't care for it.  I felt it lacked flavor.  I won't make again.

Quick, easy, hearty and filling. Could have done with a little more flavor, though.

On the Keeper List but needs a little kick.  After reading reviews I cut the sweet potatoes into smaller chunks (tablespoon size) and added more garlic. Also used 1 can reduced sodium chicken broth and 1 1/2 cans water (again after reading reviews).  Didn't have tomatos so made it without (son doesn't like them anyway).  
Will make again - maybe adding a little cayanne or possibly a jalapeno in adobo sauce.

I've made this twice now, but last time I forgot to make any kind of notes or anything... I just remember that I ended up with a REALLY full slow cooker (big oval one too) because I used too many chicken thighs :P So this time I was more accurate to the proportions given in the recipe. I must say this is awesome to the point I wish I had a dinner party to bring it to, because people would be impressed! I think it's important to keep in mind the size of your slow cooker when determining how large your 'two carrots' etc should be, and chop the vegetables smaller if you'd like it to cook faster. The chicken doesn't take nearly as long. I only had about two, three hours to wait, so I made the carrots thinner and the potato pieces smaller (probably a little too small as I personally love the tender bites of potato, though they went happily into delicious sauce, so it's okay). I did double the spices because I felt it was just not enough given the amount of food. Total perfection. I made it with Quinoa Side Dish from this site, so the dinner was a little onion-y overall, but that is so all right in this house. Threw in about six boneless, skinless thigh filets from the store, shredded about 2.5 hours in, then let it hang out in cooker while making the quinoa. Food heaven. Will make again for sure. It's also INCREDIBLY cheap if you use chicken thighs. I'd be wary of letting it cook 4 hours though, at least on high.

This dish is so perfect for a winter day! what a great flavor. My boy friend who is very 'American food only' even liked it. Brought a little left over to work with me and ended up handing out recipes!

This was good. A little bland. I could have added more salt probably. I didn't even add quite the teaspoon this recipe called for. It seemed like a lot at the time, but this recipe makes a ton of food, so next time I will add the whole teaspoon of salt. I also cooked some brown rice and mixed it into this recipe. That was a good choice.

My house smells like heaven right now. What a simple and delicious dish! I used a mixture of boneless/skinless chicken thigh and breast meat (the boyfriend prefers dark meat for flavor; I'd rather eat then leanest cut of meat). Added red pepper flakes for heat and served over brown rice. I will be making this again and again.

I doubled the spices and added curry powder & cayenne. (Instead of cinnamon, I used garam masala). Salt was omitted. Very nice blend of flavors. My guy loved it, too.

I made this exactly as described, aside from only using 1 LB chicken, as that was all I had on hand. Very good and pleasantly different! Next time, however I shall BAM! the spices another notch, as I'm used to eating spicey foods. Excellent dish- my regards to the chef!

just got finished eating this and it was very good. followed previous reader suggestions and doubled all the spices. I also used chicken thighs which broke apart so nicely after spending about 4 hours on high (then warm for another hour). I forgot to add chicken broth, however, and the chicken was a tad on the dry side. I served it over plain couscous - even my husband liked it and he doesn't care for sweet potatoes - he even asked that I add celery the "next time I make it".

Maybe this is really a 4.5 star recipe, but it's better than just 4. Good flavor, smells GREAT. Authentic look, taste and feel to this dish.  I doubled all of the spices, except for the cumin; also added a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper cuz I just can't help myself! My wife really, really enjoyed it - even more than I did.

I doubled the spices as suggested, and am glad I did.  I also used a mix of chicken breast and chicken thighs, since I thought just using breasts might be too dry.  Near the end I added a splash of white wine - some for the dish, some for the cook!  I love this recipe - thanks for sharing.

Made this recipe, minus beans because hubby doesn't care for them, and really liked it. Because of personal taste next time would like trying to add some chili pepper for a little kick.  Also think it would be fantastic with lamb.

First reviewed in 2011. Everyone in my house liked this.  I think I would adjust the spices a little next time, but great and very easy. Leftovers were even better.
Update-
Still a family favorite. I have made some adjustments, I use a pound of carrots, double the garbanzos and tomatoes and 1.5-2 times the spices.  Make the full recipe and freeze the leftovers in portions for quick meals and lunches at work.

I made this recipe with some substitutions and will likely substitute further if I make it again.  I used cannellini beans and chicken thighs and added some stock to make the recipe more of a stew.  I doubled the spices and then some, except for the salt and cinnamon.  The sweet potatoes and cinnamon made the dish a bit too sweet for my taste and the sweet potatoes/carrots combination did not make for eye appeal.  Next time I will either use Irish potatoes or use another vegetable, such as eggplant.  The recipe lends itself to variation and the prior suggestions for substitutions, such as using garam masala, sound good.

One of the best dishes I've ever tried. I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so I substituted cannellini beans for chickpeas, and organic tomato soup for diced tomatoes. Also, we don't like onions, so I left those out. It was delicious! I look forward to making it again with the ingredients in the original recipe (except onions).

This was great, very easy to make and all natural. I changed the beans and substituted celery instead because my kids are not huge fans of beans, we all loved the delicate flavours and how they work together.

Thank you for sharing this.

After reading several reviews, I doubled all spices, except salt, used black beans (personal choice), added cilantro and used thigh meat instead of chicken breast. I thought it might be too spicy, but it was perfect. After 4-1/2 hours on high, the sweet potatoes were almost too soft, carrots and meat were perfect. It was just ok. Glad I tried it, not sure I will do so again.

My son and husband loved this, I didn't have tumeric so instead of cumin and tumeric I used garam marsala, added a bit more cinnamon and the parsley, salt and pepper.  Like others have suggested I am going to use thighs next time as I felt the ckn. breast was just a bit dry.  Otherwise we really like this easy delicious meal.

I left it in the crockpot for five hours as recommended, and when I came home it was total mush...really - the carrots and sweet potatoes had turned to mush. It really needs more spices than was recommended as well.

Absolutely amazing!  Loved the rich flavor of the spices (used double) and cooked in the crock pot on low for 10 hours (due to work).  The *only* problem was there wasn't enough for leftovers.  I will defiantly make this again, doubling all the ingredients this time!

Trust in the slow-cooker! 
This dish was too bland because I listened to everyone who said they added extra broth in the last hour. I even doubled the spices when I did it, but it was already too watered down.  I had to toss sriracha all over it to get some flavor in there. I would like to try this again without (1) adding the extra broth and (2) freaking out about the sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes were hard all the way up to the 4-hour mark, at which point they turned out perfectly. I panicked the last 30 minutes thinking it would be a flop with hard potatoes, but they softened up nicely just before the finish line.

Easy and delicious ... with a few alterations:  As many of the previous reviews have noted, the recipe needs additional seasoning.  I quadrupled the spices (not the salt) and added dried fruit (raisins and chopped apricot) - which is traditionally part of a marrakesh. Near the very end (1/2 hr before serving), added diced zucchini (delish + plus the green adds eye appeal). To serve, topped with lots of chopped fresh coriander and chopped roasted almonds, accompanied by couscous with currants. Served this for a dinner party - was a hit.

This was wonderful.  Like many other reviewers I used boneless/skinless thighs instead of breasts and doubled the spices.  I also substituted the tumeric with 1/2 teaspoon each (since I doubled spices) curry and garam masala. Finally, I added 1/2 cup of golden raisins.  Served with couscous.  I will make it again.

As a vegetarian, I omitted chicken from this recipe. I also added red lentils. After letting it cook, I used a potato masher to mash about about a third of the contents in the pot. Also I felt it very much needed a squirt of lemon juice to bring out the flavor. I really like the flavor of sweet potatoes in this.

4 Stars, as written...5 Stars with the following amendments:  Use 2 lbs chicken quarters (thighs and drumsticks) instead of chicken breasts; add 1/2 cup chopped cilantro 5 minutes before end of cooking time.  I've never had luck with slow-cooked chicken breasts, as they always turn out dry.  The cilantro adds an authenticity to this meal--Excellent with these changes!  Served with rice and pita bread.

I LOVED this dish.  Next time I will add more sweet potatoes.  I doubled the spices but will add even more cinnamon.  I also added raisins to the leftovers and ate it for breakfast.  Was AWESOME! And very HEALTHY !!

DELICIOUS! So tasty and wonderful. I toasted pine nuts and added them on the top at the end, served over cous cous. There was a perfect amount of liquid, I didn't need to add any chicken stock as previous posters have suggested. This is going to be something I make often! SO good!

This recipe inspired me. It thought the sauce sounded terrific and I made it with boneless loin pork chops, because that is what I had on hand. I also added a handful of frozen okra about 30 minutes prior to serving.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and the result was nothing short of out-of-this-world! I served it over a bed of couscous and my husband raved about it. By the way, I found that I needed a bit more cooking liquid that what was called for, but that's a minor point.

I liked this recipe --very good--but I too thought a bit bland so added 1/8 to 1/4 tsp curry to taste with all the other spices--made a HUGE difference! Try it!

As is this is a two star recipe but if you triple the spices it is awesome.  There are only 2 of us so this provides plenty of leftovers.

Incredibly easy to put together and was delicious! I served it over basmati rice. I took some to my elderly mother, who always claims to not like anything savory with cinnamon as an ingredient. Didn't tell her, and she said I need to make this one again! (I did confess it had a touch of cin. and she laughed.)

I originally gave this 3 stars but I made it again and I think it really deserves 4 stars. I added some hot sauce to the recipe and it really seemed to step it up a notch. It is a great healthy recipe especially if you want to start adding more vegetables in your diet. Very simple as well.

This was a great new chicken dish for our house.  I made it with lentils because I didn't have the garbanzo beans but it was fine.  Easy to make and go on a work day.  Lots of flavour.

I did as others suggested and doubled the spices, except salt. I also added an extra can of Garbanzo beans, and extra meat. Instead of breasts, i used Leg quarters. I seasoned everything and cooked it for 3 hours. After 3 hours, i took the quarters out, cut off the meat and put it back in the pot for another hour for a total cook time of about 4.5 hours. This dish was super easy and VERY tasty. I will definitely make this again. I love flavorful slow cooker recipe. I even brought some to my workout buddy and she LOVED it. Also, the low calorie aspect makes this an all-around winner.

I found this a little bland (will up the spices next time), but it was comforting and enjoyable nonetheless. As with so many slow-cooker stews, it tasted twice as good the next day. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts, at the advice of another reviewer.

This is one of my favorite things to prepare in the slow cooker.  Coming home at the end of the day to the smell is worth it alone!  It's simple, healthful and a great option for those watching their weight.  I love this!

Made this last night and it was wonderful. I doubled the spices and adds a bit more sweet potato and carrot and it was great. Husband, who never comments on anything unless asked, volunteered that he liked it.  I used half thighs and half breast meat.  Next time I will only use thighs.  The breast was a bit dry, even after cooking for only about 3.5 hours.  Served with brown rice.

This recipe was amazing and deserves every single star in my book.  My husband is from Morocco and not only did he clean his plate he had seconds.  I followed the recipe exactly and just as mentioned in other comments it looks very dry at first but gradually releases liquid.

I made this and as recommended by several I added about 1/2 cup chicken broth and doubled the spices.  The flavors were great but my sweet potatoes were almost mush.  I think next time i will either cut them bigger or else I will consider layering differently so that the chicken is in the broth more than the potatoes...  But overall it was a hit and I will make it again with a few tweaks.

I'm a big fan of Moroccan foods and this one is easy and delicious. I use Tyson grilled (frozen) chicken strips for convenience and saves $ too. I serve with coconut basmati rice and it is so good that I can eat it until I am immobile. Don't change a thing, everything is perfect just as stated.

This is a keeper! I gave this to my "burn jello" fiance to make for our dinner when I went to work. I told him to use boneless thighs and reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp and use salt-free tomatoes. It came out heavenly. I was going to add more spices when I got home but it smelled so good when I got home that we ate it right away. I made broccoli slaw with it and it was a nice cool compliment to the warm chicken.

A solid four as written, 4.5 with changes.  Added coconut milk, handful of cilantro, hot pepper, chicken stock, and curry powder midway through for more flavor.  Still feel something could make this a 5-maybe more tomatoes?  Also added celery, green pepper, and squash for more color/health. Used chicken breast meat and turned out moist-done at 5 hour mark cooking at high.  Thanks for sharing recipe-will be making again!

I increased the spices except for salt by ~25-30% but otherwise cooked as written.  It is a great slow-cooker recipe.  I find most slow-cooker recipes to be fairly blah but this was great and was enjoyed by my whole family.

The recipe is just a guideline and then you are supposed to adjust it accordingly in terms of spice, salt, heat, etc.  As someone who likes strongly flavored food, I did triple the spices and make it with chicken thighs.  We loved it and I would make it again.

Very good and easy!  Used boneless thighs as they tend to be moister and subbed canned lentils for garbanzo beans. No slow cooker, but cooked in low oven (225) for 3 hours.  Savory and a very unique taste.   Actually tasted better on DAY 2 when the flavours had blended.

This was delicious.  Make sure you cut the sweet potato into small enough chunks.  I overcooked it a bit and it was still great.  You can't go wrong with all of these spices.

I was really looking forward to this dish.. I expected a plethera of distinct flavors. I was pretty let down, I found it to be very bland, like it was missing something that I just couldnt pinpoint... I added curry thinking that was it and while it helped it wasn't what the dish needed. Its to bad too because i think if I could figure it out it would be an amazing dish.

I like this because it is a hearty meal that is still healthy.  I served it with a little bit of brown rice, but it was not really necessary, the stew itself is very filling.  My husband did not care for the sweet potatoes in this recipe, although I enjoyed them.  Next time I may try using plain white potatoes.

This is one of my favourite dishes. So easy to make and so flavourful! I use my Instant Pot. Put everything in, adding tomatoes last. I shred both the carrots and sweet potato and cook on high pressure 15 minutes, NPR for 10 minutes. The chicken falls apart as we stir after it is done. We skip the rice to keep it low carb.

This is a really good recipe! It was very simple to make, very little prep time and only takes 4 hours or so on high. I added in some pre-cooked brown rice at the end and that paired nicely with the flavors and texture. I also used a little bit more pepper and a small amount of additional salt. 

I will say that we do enjoy sweet potatoes, garbanzo beans, chicken and onions, so the flavors were right up our alley.

super easy to make but the call for large sweet potatoes maybe lessened to 1 large or 2 small / medium so it all fits in the slow cooker. smells great and tastes even better.

This is definitely one of my favorites; it's good, healthy, different, and pretty low cal/high protein. I've made it 2 or 3 times and it's come out really well every time. It's got a very unique flavor profile. The only alterations I would make to this recipe are cooking it for 5 hours or so and using 1lb chicken breast and 1lb sausage (instead of 2 lbs chicken breast). The sweet potatoes are difficult to get right and, despite the meal overall being exceptional, were a bit crunchy; in addition to cooking it for longer I think cutting them into smaller (.5 inch x .5 inch) would help them cook better. 

Plus, if you have the option to get pre-peeled/diced sweet potatoes I would definitely do it because they require a lot of work.

Tasty but spices were not strong enough for our tastes. Doubled the cinnamon and cumin and used smoky jalapeno (about 19 drops) from tabasco to provide a bit of bite with the smoky flavour

Cooked it exactly as written. I really enjoyed this recipe! I love the nutrition of the sweet potato and the chickpeas, for this pregnant lady it's great for me! 

Maybe for the next time I might tweak it after I look at the other reviews, see what they suggest.

I do a great deal of ethnic cooking and have the spices to do so.  We enjoy North African dishes, along with a lot of Middle Eastern and Indian dishes.  I made this tonight, sounded really good, we like all the ingredients, and it was easy to do.  I made it just like the recipe said (which is a bit unusual for me).   My husband ate most of his, I ate some of it, and we threw the rest away.  I had to start adding to the spices as it was extremely bland, and my stomach did NOT like it either.  We had invited a friend but she was unable to come...and I am very glad, as I would be been embarrassed to serve her the meal.  Even adding additional amounts of the seasoning did not help, and even adding more salt, and we are NOT 'salters' did nothing for the recipe.  
The one thing I did take away from teh recipe, is that the use of the sweet potato in the crockpot gives me options I really hadn't tumbled to..This is one of the first recipes I have been truly disappointed in.

Fantastic!  Followed the recipe and it came out great!  At first I thought  it was going to be too dry, but after it cooks a while it becomes juicy.  I would not make any changes to the recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and this was bland and unappealing.  I'm from Minnesota where we're not known for our spicy food, so that's saying something!  It also came out quite watery.  I'll finish it up because I hate to waste food, but I doubt I'll make it again.

We love this recipe and have made it several times. I substitute regular potatoes and double the spices, also adding a bit of coconut milk helps make the sauce a bit creamier. I like to garnish with cilantro and serve over rice. YUM!!!!

We eliminated the caned tomato and added 1/2 can coconut milk 1 cup Pinot noir 1 cup chicken broth 1 large leek, handful of cilantro and twice as much garlic and it was the perfect winter meal served with basmati and a Russian river Pinot - you'd never know comfort food could be this healthy

I made this last night and my girlfriend and I both loved it!  It's very flavorful but not spicy.  I made it exactly as the recipe said.  Maybe next time I'll try some variations, but we both thought it was fantastic the way it was.  Can't wait to make it again.

I made the following changes: used 6 chicken drumsticks instead of breasts, doubled the spices, and used rotel instead of just canned tomatoes. It seemed a little dry at first, so I added maybe 1/3 cup of chicken broth. I let it cook on low for 5 hours until the potatoes were really soft and the chickpeas were tender. My family really liked it. I think it'll go nicely on top of rice with some cilantro on top.

Absolutely Delicious !  I made this recipe today and it came out so good.  The only changes I made is to double the spices like several other reviewers did.  I  substituted a box of frozen peas for the carrots to add more color (which I added at the very end).  I also used a 2lb pkg of boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  The chicken was very tender & shredded very easily.  Didn't add any chicken broth as some other people did, and there was still plenty of sauce when it was done.   I cooked it on High for 3 hours and it came out perfect.  Healthy and Wonderful = thanks for the recipe !

Like the other reviewers suggested, I double the spices, and added 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp red chilly powder (Indian, not American chili powder! Think cayenne pepper) and 5 bay leaves.  Turned out great, and my boyfriend loved it.  Thanks for the lovely recipe!

Very easy to make and it tasted delicious. This was a big hit with all the family, even my ultra picky teenager. Will definitely be making this again.

To make this dish vegetarian, I substituted one package of drained, diced tofu for the chicken.  It only takes about 2 hours on high heat without the meat.  I doubled the spices as the other reviewers had suggested and added some more salt and some cayenne when done cooking.  Turned out great!  My husband gave it an A+

Absolutely loved this recipe! I double the tomatoes and the seasonings and added a little more sweet potato than the recipe called for. I also cooked this on low for 8 hrs instead of cooking on high. It turned out perfect!

This has become a staple for me. I omitted the garbanzo beans and I do not use a slow cooker, because I don't have one. I just cook it on a stove top and mix frequently. Very tasty

You can cook the chicken in advance, drain off the fat, the add the other ingredients.  This takes longer, but is well worth it!  You may also need to add some water to make it moist enough.

I made this really expecting something very flavorful and was a little let down. First things first, I used a food processor to cut my veggies so everything was cut evenly and cooked just right. I used a pound of thigh meat and a pound of breast which was a good mix as well. I also only have a 4qt. crockpot and had to take out some of the veggies because they wouldn't all fit. I thought the flavor was somewhat bland. Having said this, I will admit that I cook with cumin and turmeric a lot and also cook a lot of eastern-flavored dishes. If you are not used to these types of spices you would probably consider this very flavorful and a delight to your taste buds. I guess I was just looking for something more - so I doubled the spices! I also thought it needed something to bring all of the flavors together so I added some heavy whipping cream (about 1/4 - 1/2 c). I added all of this after the 4 hours and simply left it on warm for another two. It is a good dish and also very healthy (sans cream) and I think you could defiantly add more veggies to make it extra healthy. Just keep in mind how sensitive you are to the spices called for and use your best judgement for your tastes.

Pretty darn good! I would give this 5 stars if it didn't need so many adjustments from written form. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts (far less dry), added some paprika and extra garlic and cumin for flavor (doubling the cinnamon seemed like overkill, it comes across just fine in the given amount), and added a splash of vegetable broth. I also used Rotel for the canned tomatoes (with the juice), and I feel this added some kick to it that may be lacking in the recipes original form. Also, I cooked this on 8ish hours on Low, instead of 3-4 on High. As a stew the mushy-ness didn't bother me, but maybe cooking on high would reduce this? I don't have enough slow cooker experience yet to tell.

This one is a keeper! It wins the elite position of joining my regular rotation. It's delicious. I did follow the advice of other reviewers by doubling all the spices (except salt- I used 1 1/2 tsp). That change is the only reason I did not give the recipe 5 stars. I liked the thick consistency of the stew, but if you want it a little soupier then you'll want to add a little chicken broth.

I also dumped the skinless boneless chicken breasts in whole and frozen, since I was in a hurry and hadn't planned ahead. Of course the cooking time was longer, but it still worked surprisingly well! I cut the chicken with kitchen shears right in the stew just before serving. I recommend following the recipe by thawing and cutting the chicken first (because the vegetables won't get so mushy), but if you slack off like I did, know that you'll still have a yummy stew for dinner. :)

I'm gonna have to be the minority here with this recipe. I just don't like it. It seems to lack enough spice for me. And the flavors just seem off for my taste. I'm glad I tried it, though, but it's not for me. I gave it two stars vs. one, since it was edible. Just not yummy for me.

This was good, and I'll make it again. I doubled the spices at the recommendation of several other reviewers, and that turned out to be too much, esp for the turmeric. If your spices are fresh, be careful! I used a mix of boneless chicken thighs and breasts, and the meat is tender. This is one of those dishes that's almost better the second day. Has anyone added eggplant to this? I was thinking that might be good, too .

This dish is excellent and I will make it again. I modified the recipe as others have and in the following ways; I used a mixture of dark and white meat chicken and left the skin and bone in the dark meat. I doubled the spices and added paprika as well. I added abt 1/4 cup of chicken broth and a bit of corn starch to thicken the broth. I added sliced green olives.  Next time I may cut back on the cinnamon a little. Really excellent dish. Give it a try!

Tastes great and was so easy! I was going to add more vegetables, but it made a pretty full crockpot. I just added some greens to give it some Superfood power. I used *almost* doubled the spices and used chicken things instead of breasts. There was plenty of liquid, so I froze half of it! This was really quite good! We ate it with quinoa and brown rice, although it would be fine alone.

Fantastic!  I made this dish just as written (only I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts) and it filled my crock-pot to the lid.  I didn't touch it for 4 hours and it was perfect!  Served over basmati rice, with a nice Black IPA to drink. YUM!

This was an absolutely amazing dish for the simple fact that my 7-year-old son INHALED it!  It was absolutely delicious. I made it without the tumeric because I didn't have any on hand.  I cooked the chicken, and then made it in my pressure cooker and cooked it on high for 6 minutes.  Turned out perfectly.  I served it with rice.  It was a huge hit with my family.  Will definitely make again!

I make this regularly - really easy, very tasty, great for leftovers. I usually skip the parsley, use a little more spice than it calls for (plus cayenne b/c we like things spicy), and add fresh cilantro towards the end. It's in the cooker right now, and this time I added a little lemon to give it some tang.

Pretty good!  I wished I hadn't added the extra water that the other reviewers had recommended -- it wasn't needed and made it too soupy.  Otherwise, it is an excellent recipe.  I did up the amount of spices and added a little ras el hanout I had (which is a Moroccan spice... basically a mix of maybe 12 different spices, including the ones listed), and a couple regular potatoes I had laying around.  

My husband said he liked it, but called it 'different,' which concerned me, but he promised me it wasn't bad.  :)

This has a really nice, authentic flavor.  I did double the cinnamon, and added extra carrots and an extra pound of chicken to suit our eating plan.  If you add the extra chicken & carrots, I would up the spices by another 1/4 tsp. each.  Will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic! I used boneless thighs instead of breasts and added about 1/4 cup of water to start. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Very good!

I made this for myself and my boyfriend, and while it was easy enough to prepare, we both found it to be extremely bland. 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1 teaspoon of salt for all these ingredients? You would need a tablespoon at least of each spice to get a good flavor going for the amount of stuff that's in here. We both had to add a lot of salt and pepper to our plates. If I made this again, I would triple the spices, at least. I also agree with what some said about the breast meat getting dry. I may try the suggestion about chicken thighs. I don't know. This recipe was a real let down.

We love this recipe. I made no changes to it except I used canned carrots instead of fresh. We don't put it over rice as the picture shows, but we eat it out of bowls as is.

Thank you "Occasional Cooker" for your tip. I tasted the broth after it had been cooking for a couple of hours and it was just ok. So I took your advice and added another batch of the seasonings except for the salt. I did that by grabbing my chicken base and making a broth, mixed in the seasonings and added that to the slow cooker. It turned out fabulous. The flavor is wonderful. I used chicken thighs because it's what I had on hand. Nice to find a recipe that I can happily add to my collection. It certainly was a nice change of pace too.

This was good, I increased the spices when I got everything into the crockpot and saw how much was there.  That said, I really don’t see how this serves 8.

Was looking for healthy tasty recipes for my new slow cooker. This one fits the bill -- conforms to the Mediterranean diet standards for the most part.  And delicious!!!! What's not to like?

Didn't change much ... used 28 oz of crushed tomatoes and half the salt (1/2 teaspoon).   Kudos!!!!

We just made it tonight and WoW! It's  great. for our family's  preferences, we'd  omit the carrots and add more sweet potatoes  and chickpeas. We used a can of tomatoes  with  green chiles.

I followed the recipe except substituted zucchini for sweet potatoes as suggested by the submitter. I loved it, my husband has a more traditional American palate, and he ate it without complaining, but his heart wasn’t in it. Unfortunately for him, we have way too many squash and zucchini plants for him to not see this again!

I made this recipe as it was submitted. It seemed to me, that for all the ingredients, the spices were not nearly enough. That’s how I turned out to be. It was extremely bland. In order to save the leftovers I sprinkled cinnamon and turmeric heavily over the rest and added water  because it was so dry.  It helped but I will not be making this again.

Changes: added a yellow pepper cut into bite sized chunks, just one medium sweet potato and added a medium zucchini. Substituted two 12.5 oz cans of chicken breast. 
Interesting flavors.
Yes, I would make it again but neither one of us would wake up in the middle of the night cryin’ for it.

Weirdly sweet for an entree. I did sub oregano for 1/2 of the cumin, used boneless skinless thighs and we served it over brown rice.  My husband likes Moroccan flavors so I might try this again but maybe sub cauliflower for the sweet potato to get rid of the weird sweetness.

We've made this twice now, and we love it!  The flavors are complex, it goes into the pot easy (if you are cut veggies, we didn't bother to cut the meat the second time around), it seems like comfort food, but isn't high fat. Good with naan, italia n bread, rice or pasta, if you want a carb on the side. 

 To be fiar, we can't get the 4 yr old to eat it, but she's missing out!

On Monday night, this was a fantastic and mildly spicy chicken dish to make. I never had it before and was so glad to try it. I forgot to add the ground turmeric--it tasted great without it--and passed on the rice. I'll add it next time I make it. Great recipe.

We loved it! I followed some advice from other reviews. I used dark meat (boneless thighs) and they were very tender. I doubled the vegetables (but notthe beansand tomatoes), subbed zucchini for carrots and added a can of chicken broth. Great flavor but not spicy

I made it in the oven in a pyrex baking dish.  I baked it at 375 degrees covered for 45 minutes, then uncovered for another 30 minutes.  It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

This was pretty good — I substituted chicken thighs per others’ suggestion, doubled the garlic and used regular potatos instead of sweet. If I make it again, I would add a little more salt and play with increasing spices further.

No. I won’t make it again. While it was filling, it had almost no flavor. I was thinking about adding a little salsa but didn’t. It is filling though. Follow the recipe as far as salt. I only added 1/2 tsp. Instead of 1 tsp. Add the 1tsp.

Looks good but the flavors did not blend well for us. I have  10 & 13 year old grandson's that eat everything I usually serve but they were not impressed.  We only ate one serving,  sorry.

Want to give it 3 1/2 stars but...
Easy to make but I would kick up the spices a notch as it's kind of bland. When put over rice it was even less flavorful. I would guess the potatoes are absorbing too much spice. Liked it and will make it again but will modify the veggies and seasonings.

Delicious - with some modifications. Due to a lack of turmeric, I did extra cumin and cinnamon. I omitted the carrots because I didn't feel like peeling and cutting them. The big negative from my crowd - "I don't like the beans", so next time I will probably omit them. And I will definitely put turmeric on my grocery list to try this more accurately!

I used this recipe to test my Google Home Mini and how well it took commands/I knew how to use it. Seriously, I asked it for unique chicken stew recipes with sweet potatoes and here we go.  I stuck to the ingredients, leaving out the tinned tomatoes because the stew was close to perfect without them. I added a pinch of fresh ginger at the end to liven it up a touch.  I added a few chopped tomatoes to the first bowl, and my hunch was right. Tomatoes muddied the earthy flavor, almost overpowering it. I served it over basmati rice. Would defo make again and again and again.

I made the recipe as it was written and it can out great!  I have been looking for more slow cooker recipes and this one is a keeper.  It was really easy to make and cooked perfectly with the short time requirement.  It smelled awesome too!

Made as written and we loved the flavour.  Next time I’ll add some raisins and switch out some/all of the chicken breast for dark meat.  Thanks for the recipe

This is my very first review, and it is not a good one. Unfortunately, I did not read any reviews prior to making the recipe which is something I usually always do. As others have stated, this recipe was lacking in flavor and it was very dry. I followed the directions to a t; using the exact ingredients ask for and cooked for the time stated. I noticed the very last part of the directions says cook until the sauce is thickened. I believe something is left out as there is no sauce to be thickened. The only type of liquid came from the can of diced tomatoes, and when combined with the food items placed in the slow cooker this barely even left liquid at the bottom. I am new to cooking and I did not know I would need a lot more liquid to cook everything in the slow cooker. At the end of the 4 hours on high the chicken was already cooked through and the vegetables were raw. Completely hard and uncooked. I panicked and left it for another hour and still nothing. My mom and I had to buy drive-thru as that was our dinner after she returned home from work and she explained that it was just too dry to do anything with and that she would have to buy chicken broth to possibly rescue the dish the next day (it was midnight). I am currently heating it on the stove in chicken broth and I am hoping for better results.

I substituted ginger for the turmeric. This turned out very good! It is NOT spicy and a good way to get lots of veggies in a meal.

It was easy to make, used things you are likely to have on hand and seems very healthy.  I'm cooking for 2 so I froze the leftovers in individual containers for easy lunches.

This is a good recipe.  My husband loved it.  My son, not so much. He's not a fan of sweet potatoes or chick peas. I thought it had great flavor.  I added Kalamata olives and some of the juice.  I doubled the spices, actually a little more than double.  My mistake was adding too much cinnamon.  There was a strong cinnamon flavor. My fault, not the recipe's.  Next time, and there will be a next time, i will add less cinnamon.  I also added to my serving, some garlic hot sauce, which tempered the cinnamon flavor, gave a nice heat, and made the dish darn near perfect!  Great recipe, and sooo healthy!  Oh, i used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut in chunks.  Chicken surprisingly, was a bit dry.  Next time I will leave them whole.

Easy and tasty, especially the next day.  I was able to buy the sweet potato already cubed which made it even easier.  I used chicken thighs that were partially thawed so I started cooking it on low in the morning then finished off on high for the last 1-2 hours so the sweet potato cooked through.  Will make again.  Caution:  recipe is high in sodium.  Will to adjust it so not quite so high.

This was an easy, tasty recipe.  I used skinless, boneless thighs.  I doubled the cumin, turmeric and cinnamon. I omitted the dried parsley as it's not in my pantry.  I added fresh cilantro at the end, because that's our preferred flavor profile.  Fresh parsley would have worked instead of cilantro.  The next time, I will cook on low for 5 to 6 hours and cut the sweet potatoes in bigger pieces, as they got too soft.  I served over brown rice and froze the leftovers in individual servings.

I made this tonight.  I doubled the spices per previous posts.  I left the chicken breasts whole initially and cut them up late in the day so I could potentially avoid the dryness that others complained of.  I also put some  olive oil on the chicken  before putting them in.  I put lemon slices on the chicken also.  I added chicken broth because it was clear this would be too dry as made.  After all this, I have made myself a dish to take for lunch tomorrow so I won't feel bad about throwing the rest of it out.  This got "mehs" all around from my family even with all the tweaks.  I don't think there's salvation to be had here, unfortunately.  I hope the turmeric will at least ward off the flu!!

After looking for a good chicken slow cooker recipe, I settled on this because of good reviews. I made this essentially as written, and I’m glad I did. We added a pinch of salt at the table, since I had reduced the recipe’s salt a bit initially. My family really enjoyed the flavors, which were milder than some other Morrocan recipes I’d tried which were a little overpowering. This is recipe we will certainly make often.

Easy and healthy recipe. A lot of people complained about chicken being to dry. The suggested cooking time is a guideline. I didn’t have breast on hand and used thighs instead but I have used both and always comes out delicious. As for the spices a lot of people doubled them. I think it’s just a preference. I was happy with the way it turned out.

I have made this several times. I have fed it to picky friends, friends that hate veggies, and friends who only eat healthy foods. Everyone has went back for more! 

I use large sweet carrots from a local vegetable stand, rather than the smaller blander carrots you normally find in the grocery. I usually only use 1-1.5 because they are huge. Just depending on how much room is in my Crock-Pot.

I made this last night. My son and i enjoyed the spices. I did add curry and substituted white beans because thats what I had. This dish would also be very nice with some chili pepper added. All in all enjoyable with low calories and high protein.

The flavor was good in this, but it wasn't amazing.  It also made a ton of food.  I think my family only ate it for one meal, and wouldn't eat it as left overs.

It all came out pretty bland. Had we not added another 28.4 oz can of tomatoes, it would have been really dry. I don't know if I've been spoiled by flavorful food. Maybe I'm just a bougie scumbag. However, when I want to taste something, I want something to have taste. If you follow these directions, expect to hear the lamentations of the women.

I doubled the spices and used chicken thighs.  Enjoyed it but was not wowed. Pleasant flavor. i actually liked it better left over- flavors seemed to mellow and come together a bit over night.

Easy and very tasty as is.  In my slow cooker the chicken breasts and veggies were perfect in just 3+ hours (meat very tender).   Added 2nd can of beans (we like beans).

Nice flavor in this dish but found the cooking time way too long and the sweet potato ended up being mushy. Had some the first time around but leftovers ended up in the garbage.

This dish was just ok...I had to double the spices, salt, and pepper (except the cinammon), and used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, based on other reviews.

No changes made; the spices blended so perfectly to flavor the chicken, and the aroma filling my kitchen was so enticing it was difficult to wait out the cooking time! I will definitely make this again!

Doubled the spices except the salt. I used fresh parsley.  Served over brown rice.  The rest I portion sized and put it in the freezer to take to work for lunches.  Easy meal.

I found this very bland but I've given it 4 stars because its so healthy and because I think it has a lot of potential with a few additions. Will start with doubling the spices as suggested by the other reviewers and perhaps add a few more interesting veggies.

I followed the advise of the other reviewers and doubled the spices in the recipe however, neither my husband or myself liked this dish.  It may just be personal taste because the recipe sounds terrific in theory.  I will not be making this again.

Lacks flavor. Use skinless bone-in chicken thighs. Triple tumeric and cumin. double cinnamon and parsley. two and 1/2 times salt and pepper. At least 4 cloves of garlic. We served it with pita bread instead of rice. Oh my god.... Amazing.

I really enjoyed this super easy slow cooker recipe! 
It is spicy flavourful, and not spicy hot!
I did follow a few reviewers suggestions and it turned out scrumptious: I used chicken thighs, cubed; doubled the spices; and used a 28-ounce can of diced tomatoes. I enjoyed it as is and the leftovers which seemed even more flavourful, were served over Basmati rice!

definitely needs more seasoning : 1/2 t of each is insufficient. I did more like 1T of each ... and then my wife added more I wasn't aware of later while it was sitting cooking while I was at work.

Also added smoked hungarian paprika... not sure if that added much.

Used Zucchini and some squash mix because that's what was contained in my clearance kroger vegetable pack which inspired me to make this: though that hadn't enough Sweet potato so I chopped my only one up anyhow. diced the onion instead and added more garlic.

Added chicken stock cube and two cups water.

I made this so you can look at my picture of it.

Very good and very healthy.  My husband and I both liked this.  I doubled the spices, and used 3 cloves of garlic (we like our middle eastern food flavorful!), and substituted yukon gold potatoes for the sweet potatoes, as we neither one like them.

We added about a tsp of cumin,  1/2 tsp of garlic powder because we are obsessed, and doubled the turmeric and black pepper...since I doubled the tomatoes by accident. It turned out great though and we will definitely be making it again.

I will definitely make this again! We loved it! I used one (very big) sweet potato, but no carrots, it would have been way too sweet. I added green cabbage and used black beans instead of chickpeas, I also added some white wine. It was really delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

This is one of the handful of chicken recipes my husband really enjoys.

I agree with reviewer Occasional Cooker - the flavors blend beautifully, and it really perfumes the air with a cozy aroma!

To make it quicker to prep, I use frozen chicken breasts, the "steam in bag" diced sweet potatoes from Target, and canned carrots.

Very good. I added a few ingredients from a different Moroccan chicken recipe I usually make. I omitted the garbanzo beans (chickpeas), and added a diced green pepper, about a cup of dried apricots and a 1/2 cup of raisins. There were too many ingredients for my round slow cooker, so I put everything in a covered pot at 225 F for a little more than 4 hours. and the four chicken thighs were fully cooked through.

Wonderful flavor, easy, very healthy. Made it for a family gathering and it was very much a hit. In fact, I was asked for the recipe before my company left. That says it all. It will definitely go in our regular rotation of meals.

Enjoyed this very much. Used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I would double the amount of spices next time. White raisins would be a good addition as well. Served over white rice.

I had no garbanzo beans so substituted a can of black beans and one white northern beans, both drained and rinsed. I peeled and diced one granny smith apple and added a can of low sodium chicken broth and 1 tablespoon garlic. . All the spices are just right. Even without the substitutions it was 5 star. I just made it 6 star.

I made it as written except that I used boneless thighs.  I think the 2 large sweet potatoes I used were REALLY large, but didn't overwhelm the blend of flavors and everyone liked it.  I served it over couscous made with chicken broth.  There were plenty of leftovers which were welcomed the next day.

Followed the recipe but found the cook time was way too long.  The veggies were too soft (like mush).  It would be much better cooked on low or on high for much shorter time.  Over the years I have found that slow cooker chicken is not the best way to cook it.  So I cooked the chicken ahead and added it just long enough to heat it through.

Outstanding! Minimal changes. Like some other reviewers, went heavier on spices - almost double each one. Omitted garlic. Again like some others, added 1/2 cup of chicken broth with the rest of ingredients, 1/2 cup of raisins toward the end, and used boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Would be a super  vegetarian dish too. Cooked on high 4 hours then added 15 minutes since opened the slow cooker a couple times; nothing was mushy.  
NOTE! The next day sweet potatoes did break down and get mushy to some extent when spooning out and reheating. Next time will not DICE - will cut into larger pieces. They cooked through faster than the carrots so shouldn’t be a problem.

No changes.  Except we used thighs. 
We gave it a try even though we were not used to several of the spices. 
It is now a favorite.

This recipe requires a lot of changes to make it good (chicken thighs which need to be shredded after cooking, fresh parsley and cilantro), and it requires a lot of chopping even without those changes.  It's not a "throw in ingredients and have dinner waiting for you after work" kind of slow cooker recipe, which means it's not a recipe I need.

Great recipe!  Simple and healthy.  Only change I made was to add a can of chicken broth, then thicken a little with cornstarch at the end.  Used chicken breast...didn't dry out  at all.  Will definitely make again.

We did not like this. Found it quite bland and we tossed the rest.

Loved the dish. Followed the recipe but used 2 boneless/ skinless breasts & 2 boneless/skinless thighs, & added about a cup unsweetened coconut milk to the crockpot, & topped my dish with lemon zest. My family loved it!

Flavorful.  I used a 4 lb. bag of frozen chicken wings (on sale) which I let thaw for 2.5 hrs and twice the amount of chickpeas.  I also added 3/4 tsp. of Allspice.  I cooked it on high for 5hrs and it was perfect. Gave it a stir and turned it to warm, made a salad, poured a glass of red wine and dished it up.  Great meal for a cold snowy night.

I used chicken thighs instead of breast and cut back on amounts since there are only two of us. It still made enough for a second meal. It's a keeper.

I love this.  I've made it often.  Lots of interesting flavors. I use Rotel tomatoes and always add some green and red bell peppers.  Cilantro is a good addition as well.  BLSL chicken thighs are best.  I always get rave reviews.

4.5 stars.  Quite good, family liked it.  The sweet potatoes are wonderful with this blend of spices.  I may skip the carrots and add more sweet potatoes next time.

I did everything per the recipe.  It tasted pretty good, but there was definitely something missing.  Realized celery salt was a good choice.  Added 1/8 tsp after we had 2 servings, Blended in well, while cutting the sweetness a bit.

I had to make adjustments based on what I had at home. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, a 32 oz can of crushed tomatoes and only one sweet potato. I doubled the spices as everyone suggested and added 3 dashes of cayenne pepper for a little kick. I'm glad I did this. However, I did not use double the salt and I should have. I ended up having to add more at the end so I would suggest doubling that too. Some other people mentioned that this would be good eaten as soup. I did that and also ate it over rice. Great recipe even with all the changes I had to make.

Made this last night and out great! Followed the recipe to a "t" although I only used two chicken breasts which was likely less than the recipe called for. It definitely took 5 hours for the sweet potatoes to soften. Really delicious and easy recipe to prepare!

Liked how simple it was to make and the healthy ingredients. Only downside was it had more good smell than flavor. A little bland, maybe a little more spice needed.

As other commenters suggested, I doubled the spices (I may have even tripled the cumin, turmeric and cinnamon), and added some chopped cilantro to the pot to let it cook through. I also used chicken thigh meat and cooked for only four hours, and the meat turned out juicy and tender. But still I thought, it's missing something... And then it hit me. This recipe uses the same ingredients as a fabulous lamb pastilla I've made. If you want this to go from good to amazing, replace the chicken altogether with lamb stew meat. It will add a velvety richness and flavor that is the perfect complement to these spices. If you do replace with lamb (trust me, do it!!!), also add some fresh ground nutmeg to the slow cooker (about half a nut. if you don't have fresh nutmeg then i'd say a teaspoon of allspice!), and serve with some raisins sprinkled on top.

Thanks goodness for great slow cooker recipes! And the flavors in this were amazing. My husband really loved it and usually he is not a fan of sweet potatoes. I didn't have garbanzo beans so substituted a can of mixed beans (kidney, pinto, black). I also added extra spices. I think I doubled them which is just a preference we have.

Substituted the chick peas with black beans. This dish made a substantial amount. Loved all of the flavors, and the vegetables remained firm. Loved it. Will make it again, and freeze some since it makes so much.

this is a go to for me in the winter, I double the spices except the salt and don't add any additional liquid.  this is better a day or 2 after you make it so I recommend making this at least one day before your going to serve it.  I also add more veggies, usually red ad green peppers.

As per my policy, I made this recipe exactly as directed. It's not bad, but it's no "wow" either. Very simple to put together and I put it on for about 5 hours - maybe a little under. Everyone seemed to like it and it was well-received. The next time out, though, I plan to use way more seasoning. The seasoning was very mild. It's good enough that I plan to double it next time - my family pretty-much inhaled it. I also plan to serve it over rice or couscous next time.

This is a great all in one meal.  My husband and two young boys loved it!  We will be making this again! However I made mine with actual sweet potatoes like the recipe calls for, but after really looking at the picture I think the original cook used yams.  A lot of people get those confused but honestly I think it would be great with either one.

I'm very impressed with this recipe. I swapped out turmeric for curry powder since that's what we had on hand. Even my husband who hates sweet potatoes liked this dish. He personally added some sriracha to his bowl.

Like previous reviewers have mentioned, you really have to have a taste for the flavors involved in this recipe. I doubled the amount of spices, because I was worried it would be bland, however, before long, my entire house smelled strongly of spices. However, when you eat the actual meal, the flavor is perfect (if you have the taste for it). 

Overall, I give this recipe four stars because it does have quite a unique flavor that I wouldn't do for everyday. I do recommend it though, if you're looking to make something a little different from the usual.

Not crazy about the sweet potato. I served this over couscous and I wasn't crazy about that either. Next time I would serve it with rice.

I found this dish lacking in flavor. The only substitution I used was fresh parsley for dried so I tripled the amount. I ended up adding a lot more salt, 1/2 cup of butter, and some red curry. It ended up becoming a popular stew in my house.

I have made this recipe many many times because it's so easy and delicious! I prefer to use chicken thighs over breasts and just a dash of salt rather than the recommended amount. Recently I have played around with doubling the spices (everything except the salt) which I think improves the recipe and really gets it to the 5 star rating. This is a recipe that everyone loves, especially if you serve it with naan bread. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is amazing and will soon be a staple in my house. The only change I made was to double the seasonings and cook on low for 8 hours. My kids chose this over pizza!

Have been making this dish for years and its still a staple in our house.  The only changes I have made is that I double the herbs as I have always found it to bland.  I also start with partially frozen cubed chicken as I cook it longer and have added mushrooms to it and it was good and not dry.  Its an easy to make dish especially for cold dreary days.  Thanks for this easy and tasty recipe.

This was good, I made it exactly as written.  But I think the sweet potatoes should be added in the last hour as they get a bit mushy.  And you definitely need to double the spices.  The flavor was nice, but it needed more...

Inexpensive, easy, and good.  After reading reviews, I made a few alterations.  I cut the sweet potatoes a bit small and doubled all spice except cinnamon.  I tripled the black pepper, used fresh parsley, and added a bit of cayenne pepper to counter the fragrant sweetness of the dish.  I also added 2 tablespoons of olive oil, extra chicken, beans, and tomato for lots of leftovers. I added half the spice in the beginning and the rest half way thru with 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  MOST important - I only cooked it for 3 hours.  I served it over couscous with chopped scallions, peanuts, and raisins as condiments.

Really good!  Four stars as written because it really does need the spices doubled. I used chicken thighs and added a bell pepper and a handful or raisins. Might also benefit from a handful of chopped cashews? I served it with fresh warm bread instead of rice. Yum!

I doubled the spices. Used a green pepper instead of carrots. Used 2 cans of garbanzo and 3 lbs of skinless boneless chicken thighs. Used Cilantro instead of parsley.  Made it for a birthday party.  I also made it in the pressure cooker instead of slow cooker. And that changed a lot of the negatives I read in other reviews.  Chicken was not dry at all. The only negatives are 1. The sweet potatoes got more mushy than I wanted. Next time I will cook them seperate. 2. Even adding NO extra liquid there was a LOT of liquid left. So I tried to cook it down but stirring was disintegrating the taters so I used some Arrowroot and thickened it. Which made this incredible gravy that it was in. I had brown rice so served that with it. It was really good as the base for the dish.

I will definitely make this again with only changing the handling of the sweet potato.

Tasted great! I doubled the recipe. Cooked on high for 5 hours on the slow cooker. The taste was wonderful,but a little watery.    Next time I will only cook for 4 hours.

Made this with the following changes: one pound of chicken, a couple more carrots, forgot the turmeric and eyeballed the spices. It was amazing. I did add a little turmeric to my second helping and that made it way better so I don't recommend leaving it out. I'm making it again 2 days later because I had leftover ingredients and I'm looking forward to it.

Nutritious and delicious!  I added some diced red peppers and used baby carrots instead of full carrots.  I might double the spices next time (and possibly add cayenne pepper?), but this was great!

I did not use a crock pot.  I sauteed the onions and garlic then added the rest.  I pan fried the chicken in a separate pan until it was golden brown then added that too.  I also added spinach for color and put spoonfuls over Quinoi pasta...Yum...only took about 20 mins!

I do like it!  It is always nice to use what you have in the house, so this worked for me.  I used boneless chicken thighs, uncut, about 2 1/2 pounds.  I cut a large sweet potato into big chunks, used whole baby carrots under the chicken, and a can of diced tomatoes with onions.  No beans.  Used all the spices. Put it in the crock at about 10:30 in the morning, one hour on high, then turned to low and it was done by 4:30. Smells yummy. Keeping the potato in chunks was best for the cooking time to avoid mushing.  I also kept the potatoes on top and stirred them in the last hour. Very juicy. Will make this again, adding more potatoes, trying the beans and more onion, and cilantro.

Wow, a big hit for my family.  Followed the recipe pretty closely.  Followed the lead of another reviewer and chopped the sweet potato quite small.  I add Nando's Peri Peri sauce to my individual portions before reheating to give it a bit more heat.  We will make it again for sure.

This dish was just so bland. I tasted it part way through cooking and found it to be lacking in flavor so I added more turmeric and cumin but it was still extremely bland. We had made enough for leftovers but couldn't face it nights in a row so added some curry sauce which made it better. Wouldn't make again.

This is a very decent recipe. I normally make a variation of this dish with bone in thighs and legs, browned first. But this was well worth making in the crockpot. I used whole frozen breasts, about 5 or 6 of them, and then took some pieces out at the end to shred but left some whole for storing in the fridge.

I saw after I had it cooking that others suggested increasing the spice, so I added a little more salt, tumeric, and cumin near the end of cooking. I would also use boneless skinless thighs instead of boneless skinless breasts as the dark meat tend to hold up better in the crock pot. I'd make it again and serve with couscous to make it more "authentic".

left chicken breasts whole, seasoned with the spice mix (I tripled the amount) and pan seared first.  I added a turnip too.  After 4 hours, removed chicken, cut up and shredded and added back and mixed all up. Put away and we had it the next evening after reheated back in crock with some more spices and chopped scallions and juice from a lemon to freshen it up.  It was good but next time I will put some tomato paste to increase the richness, more spices - especially some hot stuff - we like a little zing, double the onion and I will cut the sweet potatoes up bigger to keep from getting too mushy. I used purple ones and they disappeared.

I made this last night and it's VERY flavorful! I will note that I had a few differences: 1.5 lbs of chicken breasts and .5 lbs of chicken thighs and I doubled the amount of the spices because it just didn't look like it would be enough. Also, next time I  do this recipe, I'm going to cut down on the length of time it was on High because everything was cooked and falling apart (or being squished in the case of the sweet potatoes) by the time it should've been just "tender". I'm probably going to double the amount of diced tomatoes (just not the juice from the can) because they got entire lost in there. Overall the flavor was excellent and I served it over toasted pine nut couscous and the flavors were AMAZING together!

Loved this recipe. Have made it several times. I've made it with breasts and thighs and my preference is to use thighs. Also, be sure to cut the sweet potato into smaller chunks so they turn out tender and help thicken the sauce. Excellent recipe!

This was truly excellent.  I ended up doubling the vegetables (including tomatoes) and tripling the spices, but leaving the chicken amount the same; I only did this so we would eat more veggies.  (Oh, and I used thighs, as someone else suggested.)  It was delicious!  We just had leftovers for lunch and both agreed that this was a keeper.  I served it over a little bit of rice (about 2:1 ratio) with a dollop of sour cream on top, which was excellent.  I've made very similar dishes before, but this one was the winner for sure!

The veggies were good and had a nice tenderness to them, but the chicken was dry and flavorless. I think if it cooked on low (eight hours) and was whole breasts, that might help.

I enjoyed it! Simple, healthy, and delicious. However, I would maintain the same quantity of chicken but double everything else. I'd also leave a bit of water from the can of diced tomatoes to make everything more moist.

I added a half cup of lentils and a cup of water instead of the garbanzos. Could use 1.5-2x all the spices mentioned because it was a bit bland. But came out great once I spiced it up.

I doubled the spices as I found it a bit bland when I tested it. Would also be great meatless. I ran out of sweet potatoes so substituted yellow potatoes plus 1/4 c brown sugar. Worked fine except I should have par cooked the potatoes first; I forgot they take longer to cook than sweet potatoes. Next time I will par cook the chickpeas first as they were still a tad firm after 12hrs on low plus a next day reheat stovetop. Will definitely make this again!

I pre cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes before adding (make sure to puncture with a fork).  I also doubled the spices and put it directly on the chicken as a sort of rub and didn't stir the mixture for the first 2 hours.

I used 3lbs of boneless skinless thighs & I cut off all the fat, otherwise, I made as written. The flavor was fantastic! I served it over couscous. Next time I'll make it with boneless chicken breasts to save time.

The only thing I changed was adding more sweet potatoes and a little more chicken. Make sure when you do make it, you cut the sweet potatoes larger as they have a tendency to get mushy if they are cut too small. Make sure you cut the carrots small as they don't cook as quick as the sweet potatoes. I've made the recipe several times now and every time my family loves it! It is such a wonderful combination of flavors and smells just as wonderful cooking. A recommendation, don't cook it on low with your crock pot as it does better on high. Does good if you double it, too. A perfect "feel better" recipe. A friend wasn't feeling well and it was only one of the things she could eat without bothering her. Enjoy!

Very simple and delicious.  Instead of garbanzo beans I used black eyed peas and lentils (working it out to the same amount). I also added Garam Masala to the spice mix. The next time I make it; Ill be adding a little heat to it. While I'm not big on spice, I felt it could use a slight kick.

I had high hopes for this because it sounded delish but it just wasn't for us. More just personal preference I think. I did cook this on low for 8 hrs because that just works better time wise but chicken ended up dry so I wouldn't recommend that.

My family and I just finished eating this for an early dinner. I doubled the spices as other reviewers suggested and I'm glad I did. It was flavorful and hearty. I used quarter legs and thighs with the bones in and cooked for 4 hrs on high.  Meat was very tender and delicious. Only thing I would do different next time is swap the beans for a different vegetable. I am a fan.

So delicious!  Kid and husband approved.  I pretty much followed the directions, but did not have a can of diced tomatoes on hand so I used a little bit of fresh salsa, chopped up one tomato and added an 8oz can of tomato sauce and it came out perfectly! Love it and will definitely make again.

It's pretty yummy.  Interesting. I almost feel like my taste buds don't know what to focus on, but that could be because I am not used to the Moroccan flavors.  I added a pinch of salt to my bowl and liked it better.  Stir a couple of times while cooking and the chicken will not dry at all.  It's healthy and pretty tasty.  I will be making this again, I am sure.

I made this recipe for me and my family, and it was wonderful.  The spices made it very authentic!  The things I did differently were using one giant sweet potato and lots of baby carrots.  I'm so glad I found this African recipe!

Yummy!  I added red and green bell peppers as another reviewer suggested, and used thighs rather than breasts. It was popular at a church potluck.  We will make this again.

I made it exactly as instructed, and it came out mushy, dry, and flavorless. Will NOT be making again! I did  add cheese to make it more edible.

I just read over all of the reviewer tips, and just put this together: 2 1/3 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs, skipped the carrots, put all the veg plus a chopped green and yellow bell pepper and chicken in the crockpot, in a bowl mixed the can of tomatoes with the juice, added the spices from the recipe plus: 1/2 Cup raisins, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1 tablespoon Cilantro I have in my fridge in a tube, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, and poured this mix over the top of the ingredients in the crockpot. I reserved an equal portion of all of these spices to put in later, as a reviewer recommended. I just checked it at 4 hours, and it is done!  Lots of liquid! It's a darn good thing I didn't double the spices, with the addition of cayenne and red pepper flakes it was too "hot" for me, so I added a cup of unsweetened coconut milk and the result was heavenly. Next time I will leave in the carrots, too. Thanks for the inspiration!

The dish is good, but I think I just don't have a taste for savory cinnamon dishes. Or maybe it was the turmeric. I might just not be a very exotic eater!

I have made this twice and family loved it.  1st time I made it just like the recipe said except I doubled the spices and it was over the top. The 2nd time I substituted butternut squash for the sweet potatoes.  My son in law doesn't like sweet potatoes.  It was just as good.  I know this will be a regular at our house.

Made this recipe last night for first time.  Made it just as written but last minute, I decided to not halve chick peas or tomatoes and it worked out just fine. Served with salad.  Both my husband and myself thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was easy to make and healthy.  I used "chili tomatoes" which added extra flavour, I believe.  Wouldn't hesitate to serve to company also.

This was a wonderful meal! I was somewhat iffy about the sweet potatoes because I do not like main dishes that are too sweet. But the end result turned out fantastic. I did not even have a large portion but this over rice brings the kind of quality healthy fulfillment to my stomach.  Some good lunches are coming thanks to this dish.

It was good, followed recipe exactly. Not very exciting, but healthy. Didn't need to cook on high for 4 hours, but maybe my slow cooker is a little on the hot side. Probably won't make again.

My husband is a great cook and does most of the cooking...and is very picky. He likes about half of the things I make, and is even hesitant to try if he knows something is 'low fat' or 'low carb' - and my goal is always making healthy meals, so long story long, he isn't always the biggest fan.

Having said that, he LOVED this. I mean literally was raving about it. I count that as a huge success :) I did tweak some things based on his taste, my taste, and ingredients on hand...

-No carrots
-Used 2 frozen natural boneless skinless chicken breasts
-Replaced sweet potatoes with 1 large white potato (kept peel on)
-Only used 1/2 an onion
-Added a dash more of every seasoning (other users were right, it needed more)
-Used pre-minced garlic in water (the kind you buy in a jar)
-Replaced cinnamon with 1/4 tsp Garam Masala (plus some, because of note above)
-Added about 1 tsp (maybe more?) red pepper flakes
-Cooked on high 2 hours...chicken was nearly cooked through and potatoes were almost soft, so then reduced to low for another 2 hours
-Added another dash of salt
-Added about 1/2 cup frozen peas and cooked another 30 min on low

The fact that this was so easy, healthy, and the picky 'chef' husband loved it...makes this recipe a winner!

Overall pretty good. Needs a little something, some heat maybe. Next time will probably add a small pinch of cayanne. Served over brown rice. Even my friend's picky teenage sister liked it.

It wasn't bad, but for my palette I felt it was missing something to make it much better. I may try again and vary the spices a bit.

Very good, will be making this again.  I did add cilantro and really I didn't measure anything, its one of those recipes that you can just throw stuff in.  I would however add some cubed mango at the end, its lovely!

This was really good.  It was quick, easy and healthy too!  My husband also liked it and he does not like to try new foods.  I used all the ingredients as specified but perhaps a little more garlic and a little more chicken.  This is a keeper recipe.  Thank you Kcooper78...

I was nervous since there was no liquid mentioned in the recipe. Just the juice from the can of tomatoes. My chicken was semi-thawed.  Anyway, it turned out fine.  But next time I make it, I will increased the amount of spices.  It was very mild.  Instead of 1/2t, I will change it to 3/4t.

Just made this tonight & it came out great! I did a few things different because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used one sweet potato & one white potato. I didn't have any canned garbanzo beans so I used dried instead (just added more water). Also, used chicken drumsticks that I took the skin off of. This is definitely a recipe I'll be using again.

Actually, I loved it but varied the recipe out of necessity and others' suggestions. I doubled the spices, used 1-1.5 lbs boneless/skinless chicken thighs (not fully defrosted either), 1 white potato (all I had), 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes (crushed all the tomatoes with my hands, left about 1/3 of the juice left in the can - it looked dry at first but I held back using it all because reviews said it would get liquefied), and a few dashes of crushed red chili flakes. After cooking for 2 hours on high, I stirred everything up again. After another 2 hours on high, I loosely shredded the chicken and switched to warm until we were ready to eat (another 20 minutes). Consistency and liquid were perfect for a stew. We ate it alone. Oh, even though I diced the potatoes small they were still slightly al dente. However I wouldn't cook longer as the chicken would probably get dry. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow that was good. I had to make substitutions and I didn't have everything needed. Fresh onion and garlic became powdered versions. Large carrot became frozen mixed veggies. Sweet potato became yellow potato and tumeric became ground mustard.  Because I used regular potatoes rather than sweet I added in tarragon.  I'm sure once I cook this the regular way it'll be just as yummy too. :)

This recipe was delicious. I would highly recommend it. The only thing I did different was I used regular potatoes because I didn't have any sweet potatoes on hand. We really enjoyed the exotic spice blend. Even my picky son said it was pretty good and ate it up.

I followed the recipe verbatim and was skeptical with the amount of seasoning called for.  It just didn't seem like enough.  I saw another recommendation to use thighs instead of breasts with which I wholeheartedly concur.  Wasting $10 for 2lbs of chicken breasts that ended up dry and unappetizing was so disappointing.  I will be eating the leftovers but will be happy when they are gone.  We won't be fixing this one again.  Easy, yes.  Nutritious, yes.

Crazy simple and delicious!! The sweet potatoes cooked down and made a nice thickener. The flavor was outstanding, not too "exotic" for my husband. Will make it again.

Pretty solid recipe thank you! As suggested I added bell peppers and broccoli slaw. I also added smoked sausage, extra garlic, and curry powder, and a little cream to the mixture. Overall I added more seasonings than in the recipe

The spice mixture in this dish is wonderful! Really liked the flavor. Low fat as well and pretty adaptable. When I went to get my sweet potatoes I discovered they had gone bad and substituted plain white potatoes instead. I hope to make this again, perhaps substituting the chicken with little meat balls made with the same spice mixture.

This is very delicious and hearty. The spices are perfect - not overpowering. I used white potatoes instead of sweet potatoes because my kids are not fans, but next time I will try both kinds of potatoes. I made couscous to serve with the stew. How can something this delicious and satisfying be so easy?!?!

I thought Cinnamon and Chicken was a unique combination...but one I really enjoyed.  My husband and I loved the recipe, my kids felt it had too many spices.  I would definitely make it again.  I think it would be great over rice.

This is an excellent dish to feed a crowd. I followed the other reviewers, Double Spices. I lightly seasoned my chicken prior to adding to the cooker. This is my second time making the dish & I added green peppers. I think this addition adds more flavor as well as color to this dish. I serve it over flavored couscous (Parmesan). My family loves this dish but I personally feel its for a more mature palate. Young kids probably won't enjoy this dish very much. 4 hours on high was long enough & I stirred 1/2 way into cooking. You don't want to over cook veggies.

My husband and I loved this! Sometimes I find myself in a cooking rut where a lot of the food we eat has similar ingredients and spices, especially if it comes from the crock pot. This recipe breaks that cycle. I pretty much made it true to the recipe except that I really don't measure things out so I probably put more spices in than it called for.

Hooray for a recipe that's supposed to be easy and actually is! I just wish I'd made more; made it on Saturday and had to make my husband ration it so I'd have at least some to take to work.

Did not have any turmeric so did without.  Also Substituted one of the sweet potatoes for a regular one.  Overall pretty good meal.  My husband who is a picky eater, and not one to try many new things, liked it.

Very easy slow cooker recipe but so delicious. This was the first CrockPot meal I have ever made. It smelled so good. I doubled the spices and used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. It is a very cheap recipe as well. It was a little overdone at four hours, I think it would have been ready at three. Highly suggest this recipe to impress your guests and not spend too much effort doing it!

I'm pretty picky with my recipes, and this was by far one of the best recipes I've made! It had a WONDERFUL combination of spices that just made the dish. On top of all of that, it is a really healthy meal, which is very important to us. Definitely putting this in our permanent recipe box.

Delicious and easy slow-cooker recipe.  I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts just because I like them better.  Forgot the carrots at the store but used some baby carrots we had in the fridge which worked just as well.  I also peeled and cubed the sweet potatoes and they became "fall apart" tender, just how I like them.

A-Mazing! I took other's advice and doubled the spices. Except for the pepper. (Maybe even a bit more than double) I also used chicken thighs instead of breast. Mine was definitely NOT too dry.  Plenty of soupy-ness to have over rice. Thank you for a new family favorite!

I loved this recipe.  I used off-the bone chicken thighs and liked how moist the chicken was.  The sweet potatoes were a really lovely addition.  I cooked on the stove-top, and it turned out great.   Definitely will make this again

We really liked this! I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, and also added a cup of chicken broth, although it didn't really need it. Next time, I will mix the diced tomatoes with the spices, and then pour them both in together. I served it over rice, and my 2 year old daughter and I both enjoyed it.

Amazing flavor! As suggested by others, I doubled the spices - definitely had a lot of flavor, wasn't bland at all. The chicken was a tad dry, but there was a lot of liquid in the pot, so I don't think I needed to add in chicken stock like others did, I think I just should have stopped it at 3.5 hours on high instead of 4. Also the potatoes I think would be a bit less mushy. Speaking of potatoes, I had no idea what "large' meant, so I diced and measured about 1 lb 10 oz and it seemed to be a perfect amount. Hope this helps you.

I have made this a few times now, and LOVE it.  I like to use skinless chicken thighs.  I put them in whole, and after cooking the meat falls off the bone!  I have served this for guests, and they loved it too.  My Mom requested it for her birthday meal.  I suggest serving it with the couscous with pine nuts by Ina Garten (Barefoot Contessa).  The recipe is on foodnetwork.com.

I made this tonight according to the recipe.  Many reviewers said that it was great as is, some said it was too sweet, and some said it was too bland.  Initially I think it tasted rather bland but the more I ate the more I could taste the spices so I am glad I did not add more that the recipe called for.  My boyfriend said that it was too sweet and did not care for it but I did not think it was to sweet at all so I think this has a lot to do with personal preference.  I am not quite sure what it is about this dish but it does feel like its missing something like other reviewers have said.

Great flavor and super easy! I used chicken thighs and doubled the spices, and, since I didn't have chicken broth, I added a few dashes of salt that really helped bring out the taste.

Tasted rather bland and the chicken was dry. I used chicken breasts - so that could have been it.

This was great! I added fresh figs in the last hour of cooking and served over couscous. I only used 1 pound of chicken breast because that is all I had and it still turned out very good.
