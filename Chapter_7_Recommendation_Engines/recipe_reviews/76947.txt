Simple and delicious. I used a special bread with cheese ribbons and onions in it -- delicious! I would highly recommend using a bread with zip. For a no-cleaning option, wrap cookie tray in foil before cooking and discard after. I made Eileen's Artichoke and Roasted Red Pepper Dip as a topping and it was a hit!

I make these ALL the time! Depending on what I'm serving them with, sometimes I'll sprinkle them w/ different herbs or spices before baking. Also, if I'm in a hurry, I'll just toast them under the broiler...same result, just a lot faster! I always use a sheet pan, so I turn them 1/2 way through. These are great!!!! :)

This is a great alternative to cracers when serving dips, spreads or bruschetta.
