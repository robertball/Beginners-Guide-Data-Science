this had a great ratio of ingredients!  a good tip that i have about cooking sushi rice perfectly if you have a rice cooker is after rinsing your rice, put your hand flat on top of the rice and allow the water to fill until it just covers your hand.  a japanese friend taught me that, and it has turned out perfectly every time, even when my husband does it, and he has much larger hands than I do!

This recipe has a good ratio of ingredients - I like my rice a bit on the vinegary side, I guess. The only changes I made were to cut out the oil and to add everything to the water in the beginning in stead of cooking the sugar/vinegar mixture seperately. This allows the flavors to really sink in, and it makes the whole process easier, too.

This is a great recipe for sushi rice. Instead of boiling the vinegar/sugar/ salt, I just put it in the microwave for about 1 minute. It comes out the same!

The rice was cooked well, but it was way too sweet and vinegary for my taste. I could eat sushi rice for a meal, so I was pretty disappointed. I may try it again, but with much less vinegar and sugar. Other recipes that I've tried use a fraction of what this one calls for...

This is really good!! 
I always use this rice recipe in my sushi rolls, and everyone raves about them I HIGHLY recommend this recipe if you are making sushi! (I just bought short-grain rice from my grocery store- they didn't have sushi rice, but I think it is pretty much the same thing.  It worked out perfect for me.)

Good recipe.
I used a rice cooker as well and I use 1 cup rice for 1 1/4 cup liquid ratio.
If you use Kokuho Rose sushi rice you do not have to rinse before cooking.

A few tips- if you're making a larger batch, omit the vegetable oil, and add some slices of orange and lemon, including the rind, to the vinegar mixture.  You'll also want to add a piece of kelp, if you can find it (try an asian grocery store).   Let that sit overnight so that the flavors can come out.    A good grade of rice is medium grain California extra fancy sushi rice.    When you mix the rice and vinegar mixture together, do it in a wooden bowl (unsealed) with a wooden rice paddle or wide spoon- this helps keep the moisture level in the rice perfect.  If you're very into making sushi, there are traditional bowls made specifically for this, they look like the bottom part of a wooden barrel and have a metal band going around the side.  You'll also want to pour the vinegar mixture over a spoon into the cooked rice so that it's sprinkled evenly, otherwise you'll end up with clumps of plain rice and this can make it difficult to spread the finished rice onto the nori (sushi seaweed).

I used the suggestion of reviewer JamieS. She was right, it did turn out perfectly. I reduced the sugar and vinegar by a smidge, and cooked rice in a rice cooker.

This was great. I agree it would have been to much vinegar. I did reduce the Vinegar to 1/3 cup and I tasted the rice as I was mixing in the liquid and stopped when it had the right flavor (I didnt use it all). Half of cooking is tasting as you go and this turned out beautifuly for me.

Thanks Lucy!
This is a perfect starting point for anyone making sushi!  Your taste may vary (despite other commenters, I like the sugar right where it is!) and I find every time I try a new brand of rice wine vinegar, I need to adjust the amount.  My local market has a dozen brands!  Some brands HAVE SUGAR in them - especially if they say "sushi vinegar" so check the ingredients - you might be doubling up on the sugar.
I add the salt to the rice water.
I microwave the vinegar and sugar together for 30 seconds instead of using a kettle.
I don't use oil but you must cut, toss, or spread out the rice as you drizzle the vinegar mixture into it.

I lost my own recipe for sushi rice, and was a bit worried about the vegetable oil part, but it was very very good- thank you! Will definitely use again!

It really is perfect, and I wouldn't change a thing.  I read that one reviewer omitted the oil.  I might do that next time, just to cut the fat.  The only tip I have is to handle the rice with wet hands, which silly me only found out about halfway through handling.

Just as Jamie said, put your hand in the water of the rice cooker. Been doing this for 15 years. 
As for the recipe, I just add it all to the warm rice. No need to boil. Just cut the sugar a little.

I was looking for a simple sushi recipe to start off with and this one is excellent. Great flavor and after a few times making it the only thing I added was 1tbl spoon of red wine when I mix the sugar and vinegar(doesn't change rice color in case you were wondering).

I have tried this recipe five times now and my rice turns out starchy and smeary every time despite rinsing the rice until water is clear/following all directions. I have investigated other sushi rice recipes on the internet and it seems the cooking time is too long with this recipe. In the other recipes there is no oil. I will not make this one again and would not recommend it.

I had never made sushi before, and I used this for that first recipe. It turned out amazing! If I wouldn't have found this recipe, I don't think it would have been half as good!

This recipe complimented my sushi very nicely.  I took another reviewers suggestion and slowly added each ingredient (sugar and vinegar) tasting the rice along the way till I got it were I liked it.  I winded up only using small amounts of both the vinegar and sugar.  For some whose rice turns out to vinegary they might want to look at the quality of vinegar they are buying that may have a very big effect on how they're rice taste in the end.  My only complaint is that I didn't make more because I had a good amount of yummy fish left over.

Great! Not having rice vinegar, I replaced it with 3 parts plain white vinegar and 1 part water with a dash of apple cider vinegar. Also: no matter how many times I rinsed the rice before cooking, the water wasn't totally clear. Despite this, my rice turned out magnifique.

I have never reviewed a recipe...but must say, this is the best sushi rice I have tried. I only use 1/3 cup rice vinegar, with a pinch of sugar, pinch of salt and TBS of oil. Perfect every time!

Wow, I was surprised at all the high marks for this recipe. Maybe I did something wrong, but I felt like that rice was so saturated with vinegar that I couldn't even taste the other ingredients in my roll. But like I said, I might've done something wrong. The rice was also too soggy. Next time I make sushi rice I am going to half the vinegar and take the water down a cup.

We didn't like this at all. It was very vinigery, and its strong taste didn't let the flavor of the fillings emerge. It didn't compliment our fish at all. We won't make it again.

This recipie was good, just make sure you adjust the ingredients to the amount of servings you need. I cooked my rice with my rice cooker's sushi setting and it came out perfect. When I added the rest of the ingredients, the rice tasted too vinegary. I didn't notice that this recipe made 5 cups of sushi vinegar and I only cooked 2 cups of rice. Next time, I will decrease the rice vinegar and vegetable oil and hopefully it will turn out perfect.

i was out of two essential ingredients for this one: i only had basmati rice and where i come from, rice vinegar isn't widely available. so i made it with basmati and red balsamic - i cut down on the sugar and vinegar, because balsamic was too strong on both. yet it turned out great, works with both salmon and tuna.

Worked great for my 1st time making Sushi! Will use slightly less vinegar and sugar as it was a little too moist. Flavour was excellent.

Way too sweet and vinegary!  I will not use this recipe again, or will cut down on the sugar and vinegar significantly.

This was the best sushi rice I've ever made.  :o)  However, I did make a few modifications after reading some of the other reviews.  I made three cups of short grain rice using a rice cooker, used plain vinegar instead of rice (didn't have any on hand), and cut down the vinegar to a little over 1/3 c.  It was so good that 3 of us finished all three cups of it.  Yummy!

This recipe worked perfectly, it tasted just like the rice at our favorite sushi bar. The store only carried bulk quantities of sushi rice, the ingredient list on the package said medium grain. I decided to just buy medium grain rice, and it worked out just fine.

It was pretty vinegary for us, but it worked well for sushi. Made enough for 4 big rolls; it was too much for the 2 of us. Saved a roll for brunch the next day though! Vinegar taste toned down a little in the morning after roll. Next time we will be slashing the vinegar amount dramatically.

I don't know whether something's up with the conversions, but scaling this recipe to metric for 500g of dry sushi rice the proportions are WAY out. I found this rice to be far too sweet, far too vinegary, and way overcooked. I've experimented, and have below shown the correct quantities for good sushi rice. The original (wrong) quantities are shown in brackets:-

Rice: 500g (495g); 
Water: 950ml (900ml); 
Rice vinegar: 90ml (160ml); 
Vegetable oil: 0ml (20ml); 
White sugar: 30g (65g); 
Salt: 7g (8g). 

Instead of cooking on low for 20 mins, bring to the boil, cook on low for ten minutes, turn off the heat and stand with the lid on for another 10 mins.

This sushi rice recipe was great! It is now my go-to recipe for sushi rice :) The only problem I had with it was that it was a little too vinegary for my husband and I. Next time, I will probably cut the rice vinegar down to 1/4 c.

GREAT sticky rice for making sushi.  This was our first attempt at making sushi, and according to everything we read, getting the rice sticky enough was the hardest part.  We don't have a steamer, and didn't want to invest in one yet, with this recipe, a rice steamer is not needed.  We rolled PERFECT sushi rolls the first time!  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to cut the sugar.  The sweetness of the mixture over-powered the taste of the ingredients.  Other than that, PERFECT sticky rice!

This had too much vinegar for my taste.  I ended up adding 5 Tbsp instead of 8 Tbsp and that was more than plenty.  There was also too much water in the rice.  Next time I will try a 1:1 ratio of rice to water.

This is a great recipe. I used Mirin instead of Rice Vinegar, and because Mirin is so sweet, I only used a tablespoon of sugar. 
This is also perfect as written. 
Thanks for the posting!

I have to agree with others. Too sweet, too much vinegar. However, it was the consistency I like. I served this plain with some sesame seeds sprinkled on, pickled ginger (homemade from this site) and a little bit of soy sauce. Will make again but will decrease both sugar and vinegar. BTW, I did boil it all together like a previous reviewer suggested.

WAY TO MUCH RICE VINEGAR. It was the dominating flavor of the rice i ended up with and that made for way to sweet and vinegary rice. In the end good in thought but add a tablespoon at a time until you like the taste!!!

Way too sweet! I would reduce the amount of sugar to 1 and 1/2 tablespoons and increase the amount of salt to 1/2 tablespoon.

Great way to make sushi rice! I'm not sure if it made a difference that I just added everything at once, because it came out fantastically.  Also, I used unrefined coconut oil instead of veg oil - was a nice touch.

truly perfect. when I first tasted the rice on its own I thought it was too sweet and vinegary but then in the sushi maki it was perfect. this is my first time making sushi and it turned out really good. I used about 9 sheets of nori with this (I would have used 10 or 11 if I hadn't burned some of my rice, careful there, I cooked it with the lid on and without much stirring so I have to watch it more carefully next time). but it still made me about 72 sushis, that's a lot of money if I had to buy it all the time.

for the salmon sushis, I used les than one package (4 pieces) of smoked salmon, half a package of philadelphia cream cheese, and either cucumber or avocado. 

for the tuna, 1 can + 1 heaping tsp of mayonnaise, some lemon juice, and cucumber or avocado.

for the vegetarian: cucumber, tomato, onion, lemon juice and fresh mint leaves. (this was a hit).

for the lump fish eggs, I just used that or with cucumber.

next time i'll try crab meat, mayonnaise, lemon juice and cucumber

This recipe is really good. I did make a couple of changes. I didn't use the oil, I used white vinager, and instead of sugar I used Splenda (tastes just as good!). I've only recently gotten into eatting sushi, so hopefully I will be making this more often! Can't wait to show this to my brothers since they love sushi.

This rice has an incredible flavor and texture.  I had General Tso's chicken from Sam's and made this rice to go with it.  It was delicious and added the right flavor to go with the chicken.  Much better than plain white rice.  I have even used it for a base for my sauted chicken and white wine sauce.  Great!

This tasted like it was from the reasturants. I fan the rice to cool it and stir very little. I think thats the traditional way to do it. It takes a bit of time but it sure works well. Yum!

The ingredients list says "glutinous" rice which is definitely not the rice you use in sushi. Glutinous rice is used in desert recipes and is way too sticky for sushi as you will find out if you're like me and follow this recipe. Go get (if in US or Canada) some Calrose style rice which is the type you want other than authentic Uruchimai/Koshihikari from Japan. Most good Calrose will say "for sushi" on the bag.

After perusing many "sushi rice" recipes on this site and others, I have determined that "sushi rice" is basically just white rice with  some amount of seasoned vinegar added afterwards. This recipe is certified pretty good by me. There are probably more elaborate involved recipes out there, but this one is just fine.

Yes, it was too much vinegar and sugar, but I adjusted it to my taste without adding all of it. Note: Glutinous white rice is NOT the same as sushi rice. The former is more opaque (almost cream coloured) and longer (or bigger grained) while the latter is more translucent white and shorter (or smaller grained).

I used about half of the vinegar, sugar and salt - and it was just perfect for us.  By far the best sushi rice that we've made so far.  I will use this recipe again when making sushi at home!  Thanks for the recipe!

My sister and I decided to have a Sushi fest and this was the rice for our sushi rolls. My sis brought over a rice cooker, so we added the sushi rice, water, and rice vinegar. We did omit the oil, sugar and salt which we did not miss. Very good rice, very sticky and perfect for our rolls. Will definately use again. Thanks!

I don't use quite as much rice vinegar, and I use a lil more sugar, but this is the real deal for those who are new to making sushi at home.

Absolutely perfect just the way it is written! Don't try to change the recipe, just follow it and you will love this sushi rice. Perfect sticky rice to roll with, this is the only recipe I use for our homemade sushi.

great sushi rice recipe,the only thig I changed was the vinegar not the amount but I used falvored rice vinegar,the roasted garlic one for added flavor and everyone that has tried it loves it,even the ones that said they don't like sushi esp. my husband who at once said he didn't think sushi had much flavor (when he tried it when I ordered it out)but with the flavored rice vinegar he loves it and even comes home from work asking for it!

I can never cook rice, but this turned out absolutely perfect. My In-Laws were simply floored by the meal we prepared, and commented specifically on the rice.  I also used Jasmine rice the second time I made this, and it still worked beautifully.

This sushi rice really is perfect. I always follow this when I'm making sushi rolls for my family. The only thing I do differently is reduce the salt down to 1/4 tsp. I do this primarily because we dip our sushi in soy sauce and that gives us plenty of salt. It still tastes delicious with the salt reduced. Great recipe.

Wonderful!  Reduced vinegar to 1/3 cup, reduced sugar to 3 Tbsp. Used short grain brown rice and a bit more water as a result (used the covering-your-hand trick, and filled it up to my wrist bone for the brown rice). The short grain brown rice was plenty sticky enough to use for sushi and much more nutritious!

I did exactly as the recipe was, and the rice was nasty. There was just too much vinegar. I decided to try again, but with less vinegar. Unfortunately still no good, there was just too much sugar. I will not be using this again

I've been using this recipe a while and have been very happy with the results.  Basically, it's easy and holds well.  However, this time I was a bit short on rice vinegar and the flavor was even better than usual.

Perfect mixture of liquids in terms of taste. However, you will not need to use all of the liquid if you only made 2 cups of rice. I used 3/4 of the liquid and wished I used 1/2 of it. It was a little too wet.

Great recipe! My daughter used this as a 4-H Fair entry and won Grand Champion. Only addition/change she made was to use Sesame Oil for the vegetable oil. We even have a local restaurant changing their rice recipe with the sesame oil. YUM!

Today I was so excited to make sushi, and I was looking for a good rice recipe, and boy did I pick the wrong one. The rice turned out horribly! It was wet and sticky and  it made the seaweed extremely soggy. "Keep stirring and the rice will dry as it cools"...How untrue is this? I'm sorry, but this just was not a good recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I used it for my first time making sushi, and the consistency was just right.  The only thing I think I will change next time is reducing the amount of sugar, as the recipe was just a little sweet for my taste.  Other than that, this one is a keeper!

When making this dish, watch the amount of vinger you are adding the rice, I found the recipe calls for way to much vinger.

Okay, I tried this a second time and it seemed to turn out better. It may need tweaking according to your personal taste to sugar or vinegar.

This recipe was too sweet for me. If I used it again, I would cut the sugar by at least half. My friend recommended using only 2 Tablespoons next time.

Not sure what pp's are saying that this is too sweet, it's not nearly sweet enough. Way too vinegary. next time I'm cutting back on the vinegar and upping the sugar. Depends on your tastes I guess. Other than that, the texture came out just right.

Very good rice...minus that it was a little water. So, if using a rice cooker, I suggest only using two cups of water versus 3 cups.

I used jasmine rice with 1:2 Rice to water. It was delicious you could use less sugar and still would be good. I added the salt to the water instead of to the sauce.

This works perfectly.  just make sure that after you wash the rice, you leave it in the strainer and let any excess water out.

This rice tasted great, but was a little on the sweet side. I'm not sure if it needed less sugar or just more salt to balance. Also, because I was making simple avocado rolls, I may not have had enough balance in my actual filling. Will make again!

Easy, good results, tasty.  I used Agave syrup instead of sugar, just a little less than I would the sugar.  It was lightly sweet, just tangy enough from the vinegar.  I didn't need all 15 servings so first time I cut the recipe to 5, but I think that was too far.  Better results with 10 servings this time. Quantities and time were in better harmony. 

One important tip (via unnecessary trial and error) is to NOT be nervous the rice will stick to the bottom when it gets into the last 5-10 minutes.  Keep it on low, keep it covered and wait until the end.  The rice dried out enough, steam helped, fluffed (for sushi rice) and was not gummy.  And I didn't end up with a ruined pan bottom. First time I added more water and kept cooking it b/c I hadn't kept the lid on and turned it low enough, so the water kept disappearing.  Second time's a charm!

Rice turned out perfectly BUT it was way too sweet for me and my husband (and we eat a lot of sushi out).  We're going to try again without the sugar.

The only thing I would amend with this recipe is to add the seasoning to taste.  It will be a bit strong when you first add it, then mellow as it soaks in.  I also make it in half batches since I'm the only sushi eater in my house.

Let me start off by saying I LOVE sushi and I love sushi rice as a snack with some salted nori.
This recipe was a disaster. I followed the directions to the letter, and ended up with an inedible mass of rice that was far too sweet. I'd give it zero stars if I could.

This rice was awesome! Just like you get when you order sushi in a restaurant. I had to go to an oriental market to get the rice and it took alot of rinsing before the water was clear. I reduced the vinegar and by half and the sugar just a tad. I fixed the rice in my rice cooker and used another poster's trick of putting my hand on top of the rice and adding water until my hand was covered. It was the perfect amount of liquid. Wetting hands when mixing the cooled rice and liquid is essential. Use this rice when any recipe calls for rice balls of any kind!

Excellent mix of ingredients! The vegetable oil certainly helped to keep the rice moist so it is easier to spread the rice on the seaweed.

I used this recipe for making sushi for the first time and it was pretty delicious! I tried to make it exactly like the recipe but I did lower the amount of vinegar. For my personal preference I would add even less vinegar. Overall this is a great go to recipe!

i would rate this 5 stars but i made a few (slight) changes. I cooked the rice with the vinegar/rice/salt. Why not? And unless you want really sour rice, reduce both the vinegar/sugar by roughly half [feel free to add more vinegar though]

Pretty delicious!  I wasn't sure about the sugar and thought the rice alone was too sweet. Once my sushi rolls were made the recipe was excellent!  Thanks!

Tonight was my first attempt at making sushi. I spend way too much money at lunch!  Overall, the rice was nice and sticky, great consistency, however, next time I will cut back on the vinegar by half.   My rolls turned out good, but I need practice. I am starting to see what an art rolling is.

I tried this recipe for 1 cup of rice, obviously halving every ingredient. I made it in the saucepan as the recipe says..i didnt have any problems there. First i poured a spoon of the mixture over the rice and moved it around; took a taste and noticed: this is waaaaay to vinegar-y for my taste. I could not eat this rice by itself, too much vinegar and sugar. I will not use this recipe again unfortunately. I only made it better with a mixture i found in the back of my pantry specifically for sushi rice.

This is perfect sushi rice.  I just watch the vinegar to sugar and add slowly I dont want to over flavor the rice.  I make the rice up a day or two ahead of time or keep it on hand and it it's still great.  I added sesame seeds to the rice prior to rolling.

Very good! I had to add some extra water near the end of the cooking time, as the amount called for in the recipe was basically all absorbed, but the rice was not yet cooked through. Other than that. it was delicious. Sticky and made great sushi rolls. Will use this recipe again.

This recipe uses too much vinegar. Once you add the seaweed and dip it in soya sauce, it becomes too salty to taste and enjoy.

WAY too much vinegar for my taste.  Checked another recipe by Alton Brown for the same amount of rice and he only uses 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar.    I reduced the amount of vinegar and cut out the vegetable oil and it came out much better.

I had never made sushi before but this was great. I tasted the rice before I put together the sushi and thought it tasted way too much like vinegar.  Once it was all put together, it was great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very happy with the way this turned out for my first time making it. I used regular white rice but next time I will definetly get some sushi rice to use. I would reccommend using a rice cooker for sure because I find it gives a better texture to the rice which I find much tastier!!

I followed the recipe exactly and hated it. The rice ended up way too sweet and vinegary. The flavor completely drowned out everything else that was in the sushi. I will definitely not make this again.

Wow, it was too sweet for me. My husband thought it was fine, but on the sweet side. The vinegar amount seemed fine. Maybe cut it a little. If we use this recipe again, we'll cut the sugar in half.

You should not stir sushi rice too much, just fold it once gently and let the seasonings soak into the rice.  Do not use too much vinegar or your rice will be sour!

I've made sushi for years and this is the rice recipe I use. I always make a double batch of the rice. It can be rolled into balls and served as a dipper for peanut sauce. Yum, Yum!

No clue why people are giving this five stars. There is WAY too much sugar in this. It tasted like candy and would be far more suitable for a dessert. Stay far away from this recipe when making sushi. We had to start all over from the beginning because this was so bad.

Turned out fantastic for my first ever sushi rolls. Best rice I've ever made! I made this before with the amount stated of rice vinegar and it was a little much. So I halved it and it's perfect for me.

It was good, but needs a few adjustments. For example, regular sushi rice uses half that rice vinegar and half that sugar. Also some people add salt. Remember- DONT TAKE THE COVER OFF THE POT. I forgot, and I let all the steam out. Just leave it for 20 minutes, but keep an eye on it so it doesn’t foam up and get everywhere. Good luck!

This was not a good recipe for sushi rice! It was way too sweet, whether that be the sugar or the vinegar’s fault! If you’re tastebuds enjoy this, that’s fine, but this was waaaay too sweet! We couldn’t eat it.

Excellent Recipe! Perfect in every way. Don’t add anything or take anything away. People make suggestions and it it’s not the same recipe so my advice to them is to stop posting your changes to recipes because no one cares . Tell people if you like it or don’t like it and end it.

Waaaay too much vinegar! I couldn’t taste the sushi ingredients due to the over powering vinegar flavor. However, the texture was perfect. I did have to cut the cooking time bc it took so long for my pot to go from boil to simmer. Only took 11 min to cook! Definitely watch it.

I followed the recipe exactly. Cut this recipe in 1/2 to make 3 sushi rolls.  The sugar ruined the flavor of the rice.  A better alternative is to use a tablespoon of Mirin rice flavoring. This recipe was also too moist.  A better ratio of water to rice would be 1 and 1/4 cup of water to 1 cup of rice.

I never heard of putting oil in sushi rice before so I didn't. I don't know why you would put oil in it. You want sushi rice sticky don't you? Maybe someone can answer the question as to why I'd like to know. Without the oil the rice is great. I've used two other recipes and both of those were way too salty this one has the right balance for my taste. I find that a lot in chinese cooking as well as Japanese, some recipes for the same thing vary by the amount of salty to sweet. I prefer it more on the sweet side. You can fix too sweet easier than you can fix too salty. I gave the rating a 4 because I don't understand why you need the oil.

Absolutely terrible. I used about half of the vinegar mixture in my sushi rice and is was WAY too sweet. Also, adding oil to sushi rice is a bad idea. I knew it would be a bad idea and figured I’d try it anyway. Sushi rice is supposed to be very sticky and adding any oil to it completely diminishes the stickiness.

This was a quick prep recipe that was AWESOME!! Tweak the vinegar a little more for stronger acidity or add a little more sugar for extra sweetness; whatever you like. Remember to chill rice before rolling!

I probably will not use this recipe again. all the steps were great until you had to make the sauce with the vinegar, salt, sugar and oil. it made the rice really sweet and tangy. also the rice seemed too wet.

This recipe is excellent. I've used it half a dozen times with just a pot on the stove and it works great every time. 

I did make one change which for me, was a game changer. Instead of using vegetable oil in the flavor mix, I use 1 teaspoon of TOASTED sesame oil. All I can say is WOW!.

If you do try it just be mindful of nut allergies. But I'm telling you it's worth even making a separate batch!

Enjoy!

Made rice for sushi numerous times with other recipes and it was always to chewy. The steps of this recipe did the trick!  Soft, sticky enough, and great eating texture.

Flavor is good. Only thing is that the bottom of the rice burns if left for 20 mins (even burnt after 18 mins) need to cook for less. Other than that, great!

I cooked the rice like I usually do but followed the second step word for word. The smell of vinegar discouraged me at first but once everything was stirred in and cooled it tasted amazing.

Hadn't been shopping yet so I didn't have any rice vinegar, substituted apple cider vinegar instead and it worked well. I also added 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil, which really made it extra delicious!

For my first time making sushi it went okay! I think I might’ve missed something  cause aincould smell and taste the vinegar. I’ll be using less when I try again. But this was a great recipe!!

I would recommend cutting the vinegar by at least in half. Add the ingredients slowly and taste it as you go. Be careful to not add too much water to the rice. I will try the hand method next time.

This is the first time I try something new without looking at more than one recipe and I guess it was a good lesson because this came out way too sweet and vinegary it seriously ruined my sushi and I threw out the rest of the rice batch after I made sushi rolls (which were pretty bad because of this rice and no amount of added sauce could salvage it) 
I do not recommend this recipe at all

Followed the recipe exactly and was not happy at all with the results. It was much too sweet. even after completely cooling. No amount of fillings/seaweed masked the sweetness.

This is dope - four stars indeed

Let me first say that I'm familiar with making sticky rice, but I was using this as a refresher on what seasonings to put in.

Rice vinegar is ideal if you can get it, but regular vinegar works fine. Also, medium grain rice works fine but don't go any longer.

Also, instead of preparing the vinegar separate, I just took a half cup of water from the recipe and put half cup of vinegar as well as the other ingredients right in the rice cooker.

This stuff came out great, made awesome sushi, nigiri and onigiri and stuck to EVERYTHING. 

The key is to rinse your rice folks. Don't skimp on it! The next thing is liquid ratio. Too little and it'll be crunchy, too much and you get disgusting mush. 1:1.5 always. Or 2:3 whatever :)

the vinegar sauce is too much. i just sprinkled 5-7 tbs and that was enough for me. cooking time varies depending on pot size. mine took 15 minutes. i will use this recipe regularly.

Great recipe! But my advice is to add the liquid to the rice to taste. I only end up using about half as much in the rice, but I keep the rest in the fridge for the next batch. It's a great ratio of ingredients.

Warning!! Do not make this recipe. It's completely disgusting. Unlike anything I've ever tasted at any sushi restaurant. To say it has too much vinegar and sugar is a complete understatement.

I really loved this recipe. When I added the sugar and everything to the rice I panicked thinking it tasted too sweet, but then the rice absorbed it and the flavour became more subtle like it was meant to be. I've actually made it a few times because I think it's such a refreshing meal and it's so fun to make with family and friends as a relaxed fun evening. Everyone else loved it too, so I will have to put this at 5 stars. I've even started to experiment and love putting sesame seeds in and replacing the vegetable oil for roasted sesame seed oil. But this isn't because I feel this recipe is inadequate, but because I just like to experiment.

Also, just as a side note. If you plan on just eating these, typically 2-3 of the original roll (before you cut them up) is typically when one adult gets full. So just be careful. My eyes were bigger than my stomach initially.

Very good! MashaAllah   I did change a little bit, of course ;), I substituted sugar for raw sugar and I also used bio Apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar. And Himalayan salt, of course. And it turned out so well that my husband wants sushi at least twice a month if not more!  :)

This recipe is great! My sushi rice turns our perfect each time. I do only use half of the vinegar mixture otherwise the rice comes out extremely sour. I think using half of the mixture makes it taste just like the rice from the sushi place by my house.

I made the rice for sushi rolls and it was perfectly cooked. Too vinegary for my taste but I will definitely remake this using a fraction of the vinegar.

Given my lack of cooking experience, I followed the recipe to the letter. It did seem like it came out a bit vinegary tasting, so I might adjust it in the future now that I have something for comparison.

On that note: everyone liked the sushi I made with it, so I’ll call it a successful first attempt!

As some other people mentioned it was a bit too much of vinegar and sugar for me. So I didn't add the whole portion of that vinegar-sugar but jast used 3 tb sp of it, the rest I lef for the next time. That way it was delicious.

Perfect for sushi making at your house. Weather it’s in a roll or just with a piece of fresh raw fish over a ball of rice. Even just eating with some soy sauce and wasabi mixture. This recipe makes a lot so we had to adjust it to our family size. It’s pretty easy to make also. I was skeptic at first but it was a great tasting sushi rice and so easy our kids could make it. Didn’t change a thing. Thank you for a great recipe.

Put in less sugar and taste the rice about half way through adding the syrup. This completely saturates the rice in the vinegar. It's a bit much.

The rice came out more like porridge than rice. Too much water and too long cooking time.  After researching the web, it should be 2 cups of rice and about 2 cups to 2.5 cups of water NOT 3 cups of water and it should be 15 minutes of cooking time and NOT 20 minutes.

This was horrible when followed to the T. When people rate a recipe, they really should rate the ORIGINAL recipe, not the review tips. It was so sweet and mushy. Way too much sugar, not enough salt, and too much water during the cooking process. This was disgusting.

This Sushi rice recipe is way to strong with vinegar! I also could not get my rice to dry with so much liguid, and I have been making Sushi off and on for 30 years! Just lost  my recipe for Sushi Rice! 
Through trial and error I found the best flavor with half the sauce ingredients, except for 1 T. Of Sesame Oil, if you like it, and 1 T. Of Fresh toasted Sesame seeds if you like them, I like the little crunch they bring.

I usually use about half or a little more of the seasonings for the rice.  One cup of rice makes about 3 rolls.  TIPS!!  During the boiling stage, stir rice to prevent sticking to the bottom of the pot!  Turn fire ALL THE WAY DOWN.  After 20 minutes, turn off fire and DO NOT LIFT LID for 10 more minutes!  Turn rice carefully into a  wide shallow bowl.  USE A WOODEN SPOON to carefully stir in vinegar solution slowly - a little at a time using a "sawing" motion with the spoon!

A great sushi rice recipe. If you're making sushi rolls with it, the ingredients are spot on. If you're just making rice balls or sticky rice, I recommend cutting the vinegar and sugar.

I love this exactly as written.  I didn't use it for sushi but under a caramalized pork recipe and it was the best combination of flavors.

I used the vinegar sugar ratio as written. RAVE reviews for my Teriyaki Salmon sushi bowls. EXCEPT - No vegetable oil (didn't have any) - didn't cook the vinegar/sugar mixture, just stirred til it melted (added a little water) - added the mixture to the rice when I turned the heat down. - turn heat OFF when the rice starts sticking to the pan, let the remaining heat of the pan evaporate excess liquid.

I think this was a good start, but like others I thought it was too sweet. I had cut the sugar and vinegar as others suggested, however ended up adding more vinegar to cut the sweetness.
Next time I think I'll only add 1 tbsp sugar, if at all. Then add the vinegar slowly until I get the flavor I'm looking for. 
I think sesame oil would add a nice flavor instead of veg. oil.
Other than that the rice worked well for sushi rolls.

Delicious! I did reduce the vinegar to 1/4 cup, and mixed the sugar/vinegar mixture into the rice while it was still hot, so it would absorb, which was great. Worked perfectly~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good. I made rice in rice cooker as usual. Made the sauce as listed. I didn't wait for the rice to cool and combined rice and sauce in a pan. Put in freezer to cool and came out delicious.

It's all in the brand of rice you get.  For me I only use CalRose Brand rice as it will cook up being sticky (to be eaten with chopsticks).  Also being used for "Sushi", made to form with vegetables or "Sashimi" raw fish.  Other brands of generic rice taste like cardboard to me as I do like eating plain white rice.

Try substituting Sesame oil instead of vegetable oil to give it a little flavor.  When using this recipe, keep in mind that you want to have a little flavor of vinegar so that you can taste what ever else you mix or serve with rice.

I doubled this, using 4 cups rice and 4 1/2 cups water. I soak the rice all day in water. Drain, then add measured water. I cooked mine in a rice cooker.  Once the rice cooks, I warmed 4 Tbsp rice vinegar and 4 Tbsp sugar in the microwave for 45 secs and mixed that into the rice. This is wonderful for musubis!

A few tweaks made this much better for me. First, instead of sushi rice ALONE I added in a tablespoon of red wine vinegar and I HALVED the amount of sushi vinegar. I also tried it with regular vinegar and a tablespoon of redwine vinegar. Both worked nicely, except my honey says it is too sweet with red wine vinegar. I also amped up the sugar to 1/3 of a cup. It made it much better for me. Sooooo half the vinegar and use 1/3 cup of white sugar. AND USE A TABLESPOON instead of Teaspoon of salt. I know I'm making it sound unhealthy as lard but it was much better to me.

I made this identical to the written recipe INCLUDING the full amount of vinegar.  Although, when it was all mixed and ready, it smelled very vinegary, it did not taste that way.  Excellent recipe just the way it is.

I found that 1/2 a cup of rice vinegar was way too much for 2 cups of rice.  The perfect ratio for sushi rice for me is 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of salt, no oil.

This recipe is great for making sushi rolls. I have found that home made sushi is typically lousy and have always suspected that it is the rice which is lacking. This rice makes your sushi rolls taste restaurant quality and is absolutely terrific.

I thought this was great.  I didn't use the oil.  It could have used a bit more salt.  I used it to make "Chirashi Sushi" (scatter sushi) and it was a big hit.  My 12 year old daughter called it "her new favorite".  Current wife didn't like the looks of it, then ate two whole plates (which she rarely does).

I honestly didn't care much for this combination. Too vinegary and too sweet at the same time. I prepared it as directed and after tasting the rice once it cooled down I decided to make a new batch.

I use seasoned rice vinegar, so I didn't need to add the sugar or salt. The ratio of rice to water is perfect. The vegetable oil made the rice easier to spread onto the nori (seaweed). This sushi rice really is perfect.

This Sushi Rice was great! I did half the vinegar to 1/4 a cup as some of the other reviews had mentioned.   This is defiantly my go to Sushi Rice recipe.

Way too much rice vinegar in my opinion. Next time I will reduce the rice vinegar to maybe 1/3 cup. Reduce the amount of rice vinegar and  think this will be better.

I tried to make it. Everything turn out okay but it was too vinegary and salty. Even my nephew said so and he loves sushi. I was disappointed and kept trying to make it to turn out good. So instead of using rice vinegary or salt. I use my stepmom's sweet sticky rice recipe ingredient. Now it taste better.

This rice came out perfect. I use a rice cooker to cook the rice. Then followed the directions from step 2. I didn't need to adjust the recipe ratios at all.

The recipe was great.  I was a little worried about the amount of liquids added, but it came out perfect.  After reading one of the reviews I cut the sugar in half, but then ended up adding about a tablespoon more because the rice had too strong of a vinegar flavor.  It probably would have been just fine with the full amount of sugar.  I have saved this recipe and will definitely refer to it again.
Thanks for sharing!

I had to make some california rolls for my son's field trip today, and this rice came out PERFECT!!! I used brown rice using pressurized cooker, and of course it came out great. I personally recommend brown rice if you have pressurized rice cooker. Then in replace of veggie oil, I substituted with sesame oil. And I also added some dashi for more flavor. This was FANTASTIC!!!!! My 7 year old son loved it so much that we ate the leftover for snack and dinner!!! Thank you for the recipe!

This is great, I'm going to use it every time I make sushi. I didn't add the oil because I only noticed it now, but it worked fine so I'll leave it out next time too. At first I thought the rice was too sweet, but it works perfectly in the sushi.

I live in an isolated town where there are no sushi restaurants, so I have to make my own whenever I crave it. I always use this recipe, the rice turns out perfect every time and my sushi is always a hit at dinner parties.

Amazing ratio of ingredients! Fantastic! After one bite, my tongue tingled just like when my friends dared me to drink a bottle of vinegar as a kid. Few recipes invoke such nostalgia! I was really torn between tossing it instantly down the garberator (we call it 'Oscar'), or saving it til I had some baking soda to do one of those cool grade-school science project volcanoes. Eventually decided on the former, and Oscar is now super well-lubed from all the oil!  Its been running good as new ever since.  All thanks to this wonderful recipe.  Bon appetit!

I cooked the rice in a rice cooker and then added the liquid.  It worked well; although I'd probably use a tiny bit less of the liquid.  We made spicy crab and shrimp rolls, and they were yummy.

Very reliable ratio of sugar to vinegar. I make my rice in a rice cooker and I never bother with the oil, I don't think it adds anything but fat. I don't add the salt either, the nori and soy sauce for dipping give plenty of that!

I generally do the rice in a rice steamer but this ratio works with the rice done that way as well! I have not used vegetable oil in the past but may give it a try next time to see if noticable difference.

Love love love this recipe.  I don't cook the vinegar mixture in the saucepan but just in the microwave for 1 min and it does the trick.  Tip to anyone thinking they can substitute the rice for a different kind....it's just not the same.

This rice tasted a little strange on its own. Maybe a little too sweet?  It was really great once I rolled it though and there was some wasabi added to it. Great with albacore or cucumber.   I went to a sushi restaurant and ordered sashimi to go. One order of sashimi resulted in about 5 very long rolls. It was totally worth it since I don't know any stores that sell sushi grade fish.

Perfect! Now if I can just improve my roll :) I cooked the rice in a rice cooker and added the mixture to the warm rice. I even ate half of it plain. Great recipe, thanks!

This recipe was perfect for making sushi rice! I used a little less than 1/2 cup of rice vinegar and the taste of it came out wonderfully! Now to make rolls that will actually stay together... :-/

NOT so perfect. But before I started, I reduced the vinegar and sugar in half to make it perfect. Really good.

There was a little too much sugar and vinegar for my taste.  Next time I will cut those measurements in half.

I made the rice in a rice cooker, I followed the rest of the recipe to the ‘T’,  The vinegar mixture was just a tad too strong but overall my rice turned out very good, Four Stars…

Great recipe, however i used less sugar like other people who reviewed this said to do, and i still felt it was to much. I think 1/8 cup sugar and a tiny bit less vinegar would be perfect. but it still tasted great, thanks for posting!

A little too much sugar, and very wet even when cooking longer than the required time, but good non the less.
