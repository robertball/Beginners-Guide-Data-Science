This was easy to make, I added dried basil and oregano on the top, cooked it longer, and only used 1.5 jars of marinara, and extra mozzarella for the top. Delish!

I made this recipe for second night of seder as an alternative to Salmon which I also served.  It was so easy to make.  I stir fried some mixed peppers and added to the layers.  I only used 2 jars of marinara sauce, which was enough.  Next time I may add spinach to the ricotta which I think would also be very nice.  My guests absolutely loved it, you would never have known it was made with matzo.
