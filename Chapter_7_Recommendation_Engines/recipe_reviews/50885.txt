These were so delicious! I made them for my family's Xmas celebration and to my surprise, even my finicky grandmother liked them! A few people were even dipping them in Natalie L's Easy Fruit Dip that I had made. The next time I have these I think I might try them with a spicy dijon mustard but for the most part, they are perfect alone. I will also use much smaller spoonfuls to make smaller fritters - maybe a little less than a tablespoon instead of a heaping tablespoon.

THESE WERE REALLY GOOD!I USED MY LEFT OVER COOKED PUMPKIN AND TO MY SURPRISE I COOKED THEM TWICE IN ONE WEEK! I SUGGEST YOU MAKE THEM SMALLER, AS THE FIRST BATCH I MADE WERE TABLESPOON SIZE AND I THOUGH THEY WERE TO BIG AND TO MOIST INSIDE, SO THE SECOND TIME I DID THEM HALF THE SIZE AND I LIKED THEM BETTER.

Holy Cow!! These were so good, they disappeared way too fast!  I did add a little cayenne and garlic powder and upped the curry. I used whole wheat flour so they were a LITTLE healthier... *Note these are TOTALLY WORTH the deep fried guilt*  I used a cup and 1/2 sour cream, mixed in a tbsp of dill and a little garlic powder for a dipping sauce. TOTALLY MADE IT. ;D  Thank you for such an Awesome Recipe!!

My boyfriend and I both thought these were phenomenal.  I did double the curry b/c the blend I have is fairly mild and we like things spicy.  We didn't think they needed a dipping sauce at all; perfect as is.  Keep in mind that the blend of curry you use will have a lot to do with the outcome.  Curry is not a spice unto itself, it is a blend of several different spices and the flavor and strength varies widely.  I tasted the batter before frying to make sure the spice level was correct.

In regards to bad reviews b/c these were "bland" or "unhealthy" -- they were bland b/c the amount of curry needed depends on the blend you use, and if you don't want to eat something unhealthy, WHY are you making a FRITTER (which basically means FRIED BATTER) recipe?  

Anyhow, after trying these with the original recipe and reading the reviews, I feel inspired to make a batch for Thanksgiving but omit salt and add brown sugar instead, omit curry powder and use pumpkin pie spices instead, then dust with powdered sugar when they're done frying.  

Thanks for a fantastic & versatile recipe!

I increased the curry and added minced dry onion to add the extra needed spice. I like the suggestion of using sour cream to top them off because I was acutully thinking of using a cucumber yogurt sauce next time. Another idea was using pumpkin pie spice and sweeting these fritters. But overall they were good and we even reheated the leftovers in a toaster oven the next day to enjoy.

Fabulous recipe! I made these to pair with an Epcot Food & Wine recipe for Durban-spiced Chicken with Spicy Honey-Mustard Sauce. The fritters were a perfect match. Very tasty and very easy to make. I did fry them in olive oil instead of vegetable oil, but left the rest of the recipe the same as written. I drained them on paper towels before serving which soaked up a lot of the oil. Also, by making them small and having the oil at the correct temperature, they don't absorb a lot of oil. The addition of the curry is wonderful giving the fritters a nice taste without them being overpowering. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for the keeper recipe!

These were amazing. Even my family who despise curry loved them. I used half cup flour like others said and they were devoured. Yum thank you! So easy and quick too.

These are pretty bland. Too much flour dilutes the pumpkin flavor. And they need a good sauce with them. Not too mention all that oil makes them really unhealthy.

A three for being different.  We used the honey mustard sauce from the Aussie Chicken recipe to dip in. It was good, but still not a knock out.

Not bad! They're soft and plump like the description says. I think a bit of cinnamon would do well...or you could make them sugary.

I wanted to try these as dessert,so I omitted the curry, changed it to 3/4 cup of flour and added 1/2 cup of sugar, 2 rounded tsp. of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger.  When cool, I dusted them with confectioner's sugar.  I received rave reviews, and it's so easy to make, I can even do them on short notice.

Love these! I have made this 3 times now- all from the same extra large pumpkin I bought. I cut the pumpkin into chunks sprinkle olive oil, curry powder, black pepper, cumin, ginger, fennel seeds and coriander and bake it in the oven for 40 min. Then I stick it in the blender with all the seasoning (make sure to de-glaze the pan and put in blender) Then I have great pumpkin puree to start with! I add chopped onion and frozen peas to the mix and continue to follow the recipe.   It is fabulous every time- tastes great with honey mustard mixed with natural rice vinegar for a dipping sauce.

These are good, albeit slightly plain. I used 1/2 c flour, rather than the full 1 c, so that the pumpkin flavor was more pronounced and it worked splendidly. I also found that a bit of sour cream as a topping gives the fritters a finished and complete taste.

These were super easy to make and didn't taste bad, but they were a little on the bland side for Curry. I think I will try them again but add some ginger, mustard, and a dash of cyan like I would in a chicken curry recipe to add some bite.  The resident 5 year old like them dipped in honey.  As is, you could easily turn them into a spicy doughnut rolled in powder sugar, maybe add some cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice if you are going that direction?  As is these would be a good dumpling on the side of a saucy Indian dish, but just as a snack, they really kind of lack.

I wasn't crazy about how these turned out. I didn't taste much of the pumpkin and then I added a little too much extra salt. And then something happened when I cooked then because when I served them, half of them were just batter on the inside. I'll try them again soon.

Excellent flavor, perfect texture, but really needs a dipping sauce to go with it (BBQ sauce or ranch in a pinch, dill/sourcream would be excellent). I added some chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder and was very pleased with the result.

I grew up having a similar version of these Pumpkin Fritters, except they are sweet.  It is actually a typical food for us (Puerto Ricans).  We call them "Tortitas de Calabaza" or "Barriga de Vieja".   You can sprinkle them with sugar if you like, but they are sweet enough without.  Enjoy while still warm.

I customized these since I didnt have curry (and honestly not too fond of it).  I added another half a can of pumpkin bc it tasted like everyone said... floury. 1 cup white sugar; 2 teaspoons of pumpkin spice 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. And when frying them I made them acorn sized and when I took them out I put them on a papertowel and placed another over them to absorb that extra grease every spoke about.  So my end result?... Pumpkin Pie Fritters =)

These were so yummy!!! I just had to try them and they didn't last very long. Thumbs up, nothing needs to be changed (I didn't have curry powder so I used half turmeric and half garam masala)! The flavours were so complementary to one another, and nothing was overpowering. I'm already getting requests to make more! I bet this would be good with squash or even sweet potato: I'll have to give it a try!

Mixed reviews. Daughter and I loved these, though I'd like to use less flour next time..., just a tad - as these were more cake-like than I had hoped.  One son enjoyed these fritters after he asked me to add ham to some of them (daughter and I liked these that way too, but I'd recommend cutting the salt if you are going to add ham).  My dh said he could put up with these fritters if he had something to dip them in (we had soup, and that was good enough). In the past, he really despised pumpkin, but we've found some common ground on pumpkin (I think he's putting up with me..... he's kinda cute, ya know?).  Well, there are some pumpkin things he simply will not eat, so it is saying *something* that he'll eat these.  I'm just glad that he will, 'cuz i really do like these - but I shouldn't eat them all....., or even half of them!

Absolutely delicious! I seasoned to taste with the curry powder and salt, and started with 1/2 cup flour. It was still a little too thin, so I added another 1/4 cup flour to end at about 3/4 cup. I also did not submerge them. I put just a little oil at the bottom of the pan and flattened them like little pancakes. They do soak up a lot of oil, and using this method prevents so much oil from being used. I made a simple dip of sour cream, dill weed, and garlic salt. I thought they were amazing, but if you don't like curry you will not like these. I took it to work and it was hit or miss. It could easily be altered to be a sweeter/dessert dish using the same cooking method.

this is an excellent appetizer recipe I did change it a bit: I added 2 t curry, cut the flour to 1/2 cup, added garlic salt, nutmeg and cinnamon.  I tried them fried, but found the oil overwhelming the pumpkin.  I fried them in a bit of butter and oil in a fry pan, like a blini (little pancake). I topped them with a dot of sour cream mixed with Major Grey chutney...awesome!!

We made this last night and really enjoyed  them.The curry is not the best spice for this, in my opinion. Next time, I would try more of a cinnamon or something like an allspice. Would help if they had a dusting of powdered sugar as well. 

First time making fritters and the directions were spot on.

They are very fluffy. I made them to the recipe but instead of curry I did pumpkin pie spice. I also put powder sugar on them before setting them out. They went really fast. Really good- I have to find the curry powder to try the real thing.

Not bad, but I usually prefer pumpkin stuff to be a little sweeter.  Wound up dusting these with powdered sugar.  Made them again without the curry (I think my curry powder is a bit on the strong side), and used pumpkin pie spice and dusted with powdered sugar.  Wonderful!!!  My kids gobbled them up and keep asking me to make them again!

very quick and easy preparation, great for an appetizer. it was more savory not sweet so I  tossed them in cinnamon sugar and a bit more curry and ginger and served with yogurt cream cheese dip.

As other reviewers suggested, I added garlic and some other seasonings to it. My whole family loved these, even my son with sensory processing disorder who has super serious food issues!
  I have a new favorite (and easy!!!) pumpkin recipe. I used a white pumpkin and cut it up and baked it until it was soft enough for my blender to puree, which I did along with the egg and seasonings. Then I stirred in the flour and plopped little spoonfuls into the hot oil. I totally forgot about the baking powder, and they were still great.
 I rarely fry things. But this really was so good I will likely do this a few times every year when pumpkins are in season!

Very tasty! I agree that you need to halve the size of the fritters or they can stay doughy in the middles, but some people like them that way. I tried the recipe as is first (yum!) just adjusting the size the first time around. Next time I left out the curry and did 2 tbsp sugar and about 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and then dusted them with powdered sugar and a hint of pie spice...it was like little bite sized gourmet funnel cakes!

I just made these and, while they weren't to my tastes, my 3 yr. old daughter liked them sprinkled with a little powdered sugar.  I think if I were to attempt this again I would alter a funnel cake recipe with pumpkin puree as these were a bit heavy.

Make a double batch because you are going to love these. I don't go for really spicy so I didn't put in all the curry, but I think I will next time because they were quite mild. I also added a little garlic. THey were delicious and even my finicky kids liked them. I also made a sweet batch by adding sugar, cinnamon, and cloves, instead of the curry. I think the sugar made them soak up more oil so maybe a little extra flour. Not sure on the proportions but they were pretty good too, just not quite as good as the original savory version.

easy, quick, light and yummy.  cut the flour as suggested in other reviews, added a touch more curry and a few dashes of garlic powder.  sprinkled them with coarse salt while still warm. served with cucumber raita.

I made these, but didn't have curry so I used allspice and nutmeg. I think they might be better if I'd had curry,but oh well.The are still gone, but I liked dipping them in molasses. my husband loves pumpkin so I made them for him.

I really enjoyed these, however next time I would reduce the flour, I felt like i could taste more flour than I wanted to, but it was still very yummy.  I dipped them in maple syrup and it was delicious!

very quick and easy idea for leftover pumpkin, we even made our own curry powder since we didnt have any. yummy. smaller spoonfuls is better.
