I liked the recipe, I did not add green onion cause I was out at the time but I will try it next time. I did add 3 garlic cloves and red pepper flakes.It was really good!

This recipe was super fast to make. I changed up the recipe just a bit. Used real crushed garlic and white onion instead of the green. Added a little vegetable stock to add some more flavor as well as a tablespoon more of white wine. Fresh grated Parmesan atop of a bed of garlic white rice. Pretty tasty!! I will defiantly make this again. :)

Today will be my 2nd time making this and I am going to add some scallops as well.  I hope it turns out as good as it did the first time.

I love the ease and speed in making this, but it could use extra  sauce for the pasta or rice you'll be using.
