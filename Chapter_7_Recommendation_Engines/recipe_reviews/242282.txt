This one is a keeper! I made it exactly as written, and the flavors were perfect! I did bake it a bit longer, more like 45 minutes, until the crust was nicely browned. Served this warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum!

I have made this twice now at the community senior center I cook for. They all love it. Only comment I have is to make sure to roll the crust real thin. Thinner than pie crust.
I will definitely use this again

I liked this and will make it again.  I mixed apples and pears in equal portions.  The apples overshadowed the pears a bit.  I would add a green apple next time; I added a little lemon juice to increase the acidity.  I used a store bought crust for time, but next time I will make the crust from scratch.

The only hard part in making this is blending the flour/butter/cream cheese.  Takes some arm muscle.  Other than that, this is super easy and really yummy.  I use whatever fruit I have on hand.  This time I threw in blueberries too.  Love this and so does everyone I serve it to as well. Thank you!!

Delicious, beautiful. Mine came out a little dry... might either cut out the flour, or add more sugar next time? Also, I'll roll the crust a little thinner. But overall, gorgeous presentation and delicious. I used Jonagold apples, and only had dried cranberries.

I had homemade pie dough in the freezer so I used that instead of making the cream cheese pastry in this recipe. Red delicious apples cooked down and paired with the cranberries to have a nice sweet-tart balance. Since I had no walnuts on hand I used pecans and it turned out delicious! As other reviewers noted it did take longer to bake than listed in the recipe (50 minutes to bake in my counter-top oven). 

I will be making this again and might even throw a whole cup of cranberries in to give it a bit of added tartness.

Every year we look for something special to made for the holidays.Made this with my daughters today. It came out perfectly, even the crust. I also found that it needed about 45 minutes to bake . Other than that  I believe we have our winner.

Tasted just wonderful but the crust fell apart on me.    Probably my fault.
