I loved it!  I made it with 4 packs of noddles and only added 2 packs of the seasoning.  It was still tasty and feed all 4 of us and more.  I sure will make this again!

If you take this for what it is, a Ramen Noodle based faux Chinese, it's really good!  Despite everything in me wanting to saute the shrimp and veg in a little EVOO and garlic, I stuck to the recipe since I'm the primary reviewer.  I followed everything to a "T", though I did have to sub frozen broccoli for frozen mixed veggies when I realized we were out.  This came together in NO time (less than 10 minutes, for real) and used freezer/pantry staples.  Four servings is definately a stretch, though.  It served two of us and I could have eaten some more. THANKS for the recipe, Nugyar!

Quick and easy!  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and broccoli was the only vegetable. My 15 year old loved it. Nice to do something different with ramen noodles. ??

Sorry, I really wanted to like this one, I love lo mein, I love ramen noodles, but this one didn't taste like lo mein, and the noodles would have been good for one person, not the 4 listed as servings. I was embarrassed serving this to just my hubby, so glad I didn't try it for company!

This is absolutely delicious and easy to make! I made it for "Chinese dinner" one night on vacation for my sister-in-law, brother-in-law, my husband and myself, and it was a big hit!

It's on the "regular" rotation" and is wonderful on Meatless Monday!

I made this dish exactly as stated except I used Teriyaki Sauce instead of soy sauce.  I thought it was good, easy to make, and not to expensive depending on the amount and type of shrimp used.  I will definitely make it again.  I will say though it will only feed 2-3 people. I used a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables which made it more authentic.

I used chopped veggies I had instead of mixed veggies.  Also, added some water and cornstarch to the mix for a bit of sauce.

Really great for the low-effort required. I used pork (with pork ramen flavor), fresh ginger and threw in some fresh snow peas.

I think this is a great quick way to use extra ingredients. Sure it tastes like amped up Ramen, but it has Ramen noodle packets as an ingredient what are you expecting.
