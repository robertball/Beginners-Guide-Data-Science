Very easy recipe. Followed the recipe as stated but baked at 375. I change the vegetable in this with what I have in the frig (spinach/mushrooms/peppers/etc.) Use ham or sausage or bacon or seafood. This is just a nice basic recipe. I never use 3/4 c. of onions though. Little too much onion flavor over the eggs.

Very very good! I made it exactly as written except for omitting the ham. It would be very easy to substitute various veggies and meats but it was great with just the swiss cheese and asparagus. It did take a bit longer to bake, but was super easy and I'm glad it made a large pan so I have leftovers!

As much as I dislike when people change up recipes and then rate them, I did change this up, just because I didn't have asparagus. I added spinach instead, and half cup finely chopped red onion instead of the green onion. I could see a lot of variations with this as a base.

I put crab and green onions and cheddar in one pie plate and broccoli, red bell pepper, green onions and cheddar in the other.  Another time I might add a drop of sriracha to the broccoli one.  Ham and asparagus sounds good too!  Serve with sour cream!

Pretty good.  The family ate almost the entire dish. Would definitely make this one again.  Liked the asparagus in it too.

Did not like ..... I made it b/c it WAS easy to throw together but just not my kind'a ham-n-egg pie. I realized after I made it, no salt was in the ingredients. Yes, added some to the finished product. But won't make this again.

I happened to have all the ingredients and was looking for something new to make out of my leftover easter ham.  This hit the spot and unexpected guests raved over it and had seconds.  Like the other reviewers, I can see many variations of this with different veggies and meats.

Was searching for a vegetarian dish containing protein. Used this basic recipe with just sautéed vegetables. I used mushrooms, onions, red bell pepper and spinach. Everyone liked it, including the 2 vegetarians among us. Served 5 adults with a bit left over.
There was a similar recipe on the side of the Bisquik box years ago.

I found the outside (top, bottom, sides) were overdone before the center was cooked for the minimum time. I used clear Pyrex dishes. With 10 minutes to go the top was already brown so I reduced heat to 375 and checked at 30 minutes- not cooked internally, so left another 5 minutes. I made 2 pies. The first I found too bland for me, ( I was using old cheddar- would probably be fine with Swiss cheese) so I added lots of ground pepper, chives, garlic, and Worcester sauce to the second one. That was better.  Next time I think I’ll try a lower heat and see if it comes out more tender.  The inside was nice and fluffy with great taste and texture. The asparagus was perfectly cooked. Will definitely be making this dish again.

This was so simple to make and went together in minutes. ( I had the ham chopped already in the freezer.)  I made it with gluten free baking mix and the texture was perfect. I also sprinkled  cheddar cheese in top for some color.

I left out the asparagus and served a vegetable on the side instead.  I will probably add spinach or broccoli into the casserole next time.

I've been using this recipe for ages, and it's awesome!  It's a great way to use up leftovers.  I save back grilled or roasted asparagus, broccoli, peppers, squash, etc.  from meals during the week.  Toss them in this pie with leftover ham or chicken, throw in a little spinach if I have any, and voila!  Even my picky husband wolfs it down.  I like to add a little cayenne to the batter, and I top it with whole cherry tomatoes or tomato slices (salt and lay on paper towels to lose some of the liquid).

After reading reviews, adjusted accordingly.   Sautéed half cooked asparagus with scallions, garlic & shallots in butter. Added plenty of fresh ground black pepper and seasoned salt to veg & egg mixture.  Used 1 cup each shredded Swiss & cheddar. This is the best thing you can make with a cut up ham steak by far.   My new favy !!

Great receipe, I'm a vegetarian so instead of ham I added spinach and red bell pepper with the green onion and asparagus.

I love impossible pies and never had this combo before. Very good idea! I did saute the vegetables and the ham first. Also added salt and pepper. Served with a salad. Watch the cooking time. Mine was done in 35 minutes. One could use cheddar or another cheese if you didn't have swiss on hand. Or use prosciutto or salami if you didn't have ham.

It was more like a biscuit with egg and ham in it. It doesn't have a lot of flavor. Next time I want a quiche, I will make one with a real crust.  It's not terrible, it just wasn't what I was looking for.

Very nice basic recipe, as well as inexpensive. The bisquick gives it a nice texture. You can make this with nearly any meat or veggies you have on hand, and any type of cheese works well. A go to recipe for feeding a crowd on a budget.

Delicious. Very easy to make. I substituted mushrooms for the ham. Any vegetables will work well for this recipe. Instead of a baking dish I used a muffin pan. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Big hit and so easy and cheap. Everyone had seconds. Made this tonight for the first time. We loved the bisguity fluffiness that adding all purpose bisquik* gave the dish. I did make some variations. I did not have green onions so left those out. I added artichoke hearts because I had those to use up in the fridge and I thought it might need more veggies. I also added grated parmesean cheese to the top because I like the way that browns. I am not sure it needed the cheese inside the dish. It almost reminded me of eggs benedict without the hollandaise sauce, but family said it was perfect the way it was. It did seem a bit dry when I pulled it out of the oven so I buttered the top. Also I cooked it at 425 so it would brown.  It was fully cooked once the top was brown at 20 minutes. And yes lots of possible variations! Will defintely add this to the family menu rotation. *gluten free bisquik
