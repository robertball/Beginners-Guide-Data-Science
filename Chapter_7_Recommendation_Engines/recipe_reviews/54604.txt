A winner -- literally! I'm a college student and my dorm sponsored a cooking contest for dishes using fresh pumpkin, so I entered this one, and I won 1st prize, a mini iPod! I roasted baby pumpkin halves and served the risotto in them, which made for a great presentation. Delicious (though time-consuming).

This took me somewhat longer than the specified time, but the finished dish was well worth it.  I appreciate the simple flavors, and how easy it was to cook the rice.  When I've made risotto before it has always been difficult.  A couple of suggestions:  1) mine took an extra quarter cup or so of broth; 2) I let the corners brown on my feta cheese, because it intensifies the flavor.  The cheese fit on a toaster oven-size sheet, and I used a 3 qt. saut√© pan for the rice, which fit everything perfectly.  I will make  this recipe again.

Wow! This was absolutely delicious and so beautiful to present as well. (I served it in a pumpkin half I had hollowed out). It was a very unexpected combination. I added sauteed red bell peppers to add even more taste and color.

I gave this recipe full rating, because I believe in it, but I had a horrible time. It was my first risotto, plus I doubled the recipe for 8.  I couldn't find fresh pumpkin, so I used butternut squash and a can of pumpkin. I cubed the squash, steamed it (too long), and then baked as suggested.  I cooked the risotto as directed.  Toward the end, I added a large can of pumpkin (3.5 cups).  In a sudden, the dish went bland. I then added more salt, but it was boring, so I added some garam masala. Everything was great again.  I stirred in cubed butternut squash, spinach, and garnished with feta and remaining squash. The presentation was beautiful, the taste excellent - but when it came time to serving this dish (5 hours later) it was very mushy.  The aram masala was slightly overbearing.  The dish was no longer great. I suspect it was too much canned pumpkin w/o benefit of salt/pepper/olive oil baked in the oven.  Possibly a small can of pumpkin would be better, but I would only add to taste (I'm not yet convinced canned pumpkin will work). I would make sure the cubes are firm as recommended, because I think this added to the overall mush. Keep garam masal, to a sprinkle and then add to taste (it was truly delightful).  I have since been told risotto must be served fresh.  Is it true?  As a dedicated pumpkin and risotto enthusiast, I will definitely try this again.

Mmmm, the pumpkin in this is so delicious despite the hassle it is to cut up (wonder if it's sold frozen?)  I also did not bother to peel it.  I would suggest using 6 cups broth since my rice was not done cooking by the time the liquid had evaporated (one of my cookbooks recommends 1 part Arborio rice to 3 parts liquid).  Would definitely make this again!

We loved this recipe!  The sweetness of the pumpkin mixed with the tanginess of the feta are a wonderful combination.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Also, it was the wrong time of year for fresh pumpkin, so I used a little bit of canned pumpkin instead.  I'd definitely make this again.

This recipe was delicious!  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable, and used 6 cups instead of 4.  The fresh pumpkin was kind of a pain to work with, but worth it!!

Very good flavor and presentation too.  The mashed pumpkin added to the rice makes the dish.  I tasted it before adding the pumpkin and it was kind of bland, but afterwards, what a difference!

Very very good, especially the second time I made it. Both times I used most of a 29oz can of pumpkin in place of the fresh, and 10oz frozen spinach (defrosted, drained well)-altho I LOVE spinach so try 5oz if you're not a huge fan. I did not cook the feta separately, just added crumbles at the end. Adding parmesan was also a nice touch. The second time I made it, I added some curry powder (maybe ~1tsp, although I didnt measure), which gave it the flavor it needed the first time.  For an easier version, I actually used Trader Joe's Harvest Grain Blend (cooked per pkg directions in broth with minced garlic and onion powder), then added the spinach, pumpkin, feta, parmesan, curry powder, s&p when it was ready. Delicious! Saved a ton of time. (1.5 cups grains, ~15oz pumpkin)

Fabulous!  But I have to add the caveat that I modified this to fit local ingredients by using kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) and Thai rice.  I loved how the sweet mellowness of the pumpkin contrasted with the saltiness of the feta.  Since I knew I would have leftovers, I only stirred together the portion I was planning on eating.  When warming the leftovers, I reheated the rice and pumpkin separately and then stirred them together with the spinach... no problems with mushiness.  That could be because of the different type of rice, but it seems worth a shot to store your leftover ingredients separately.

Excellent, my toddlers loved it. I wanted them to move beyond pumpkin pie and this recipe made it. I used a mix of pumpin and squash, frozen spinach, no salt and peppar and a light broth to adapt to baby taste. It should be tagged kid-friendly recipe.

This was amazing.  I gave it only 4 stars because I ended up adding gorgonzola to deepen the flavor since without it was a little bland.  Super presentation, delicious, and reheated very well!  Will definitely make again!

My boyfriend and I are both big fans of risotto and so I decided to make this for him the other night.  I followed this recipe exactly but I must say, we were very disappointed.  We both found the risotto to be a one note dish with no depth of flavour at all.  Can't recommend this one, sorry.

This is an amazing recipe.  However, I cook the pumpkin, then scoop it out and mix it in with the risotto.

I didn't have pumpkin, so I tried this recipe with Acorn Squash. It was fabulous, so I tried it another day with the pumpkin, but my family didn't like it nearly as much!

I absolutely LOVE THIS.  I had some pumpkins leftover from Halloween decorations and I didn't want them to go to waste.  I found this recipe, realized I had all the ingredients, and went to town.  What I should have done would be to roast the pumpkin IN the pumpkin shell and scoop it out later.  What I did was "peel" the pumpkin with a vegetable peeler (I have no idea if this is how you're supposed to do it or not.  It's very difficult!) and chop it into chunks for the steaming and then the roasting.  Next time I'll skip the arm workout and do it the easy way.  The roasted feta really pops after being in the oven and the spinach gives it great flavor and color.  I probably added double the spinach just because I needed to use it before it went bad, and it was great.  I also probably added close to 6 cups of vegetable broth, also, but I wasn't keeping count.  I just stirred and tasted til it was right in my book ;) Gorgeous and can't WAIT for the leftovers at lunch.

Pretty good and a nice way to change up basic rice. I added a dash of garam masala (not very much!).

Very good! I was skeptical about the combination of ingredients but they're delish together. I used brown rice, pumpkin puree, frozen chopped spinach & didn't have feta so nixed the cheese. Easy, delicious and nutritious!

I loved this! Spinach, pumpkin & feta a winning combination (also delicious in a fritatta). I used brown rice and increased pumpkin (looks alot when you first put it in, but decreases in size when baked, same goes for spinach) and spinach.... Will make again and again....

I was very excited about this recipe.  The mix of flavors sounded delicious--delicious enough to spend the money on the ingredients, which weren't cheap, and delicious enough to spend the time to prepare this, which with fresh roast pumpkin and risotto, was quite time-consuming.  I incorporated changes suggested by some reviewers, and this was still bland and had a terrible, mushy consistency. PAP.

I didn't find this to be all that tasty.  The time it took was not really worth the result.  I served this at a big family meal and people liked it, but didn't LOVE it....so if you just want something different then try it, but don't expect it to be out of this world.

Delicious vegetarian dish! Had a pumpkin I didn't know what to do with and this was perfect. Followed the directions exactly (although I did add 1/2 tsp of curry at the end). I will make this again and I want try it with a baking squash (when pumpkins are out of season). Thanks!

This was a little bland for my taste. I even added extra salt and pepper and dried cranberries.  If I didn't add the cranberries I think this dish would have been way too boring and bland.  Next time I'll try adding some more cheese and seasoning. Just okay in my book.

Y-U-M--YUM!!! So tasty. We made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Didn't have pumpkin so we used butternut squash and it was delish! Would also be good with some sage. Definitely making this one again!

Didn't try the fresh pumpkin, which would have been better, I'm sure, but this is still an excellent risotto.  My wife and her girlfriends devoured it.

Good, but not good enough for the amount of work involved. I probably won't make it again.

I didn't have any pumpkin, so used butternut squash instead, regardless, the recipe was fantastic.  The combination of the feta and the roasted butternut was amazing.  I left the feta in the oven until the edges started to go brown and roasted the squash with some dried sage.  Absolutely delicious adn we will definitely be making this again.

This was a disaster.  The instructions are not clear on just how to go from a cooked pumpkin to how much to add to the rice.  My pumpkin turned out to be too old, so I cooked it just to use as a server and substituted canned pumpkin, which I baked in the oven with olive oil and salt and pepper.
When I mixed it all, I added the entire 28 oz. can - may have been too much.  It was very bland.  I had plenty of chicken broth, so it was fine there.  So, I kept adding salt and pepper to help, but it didn't taste right.  We decided to add brown sugar, which we thought was tasting good.  But, by the time we got it to the table, most of the family couldn't finish it because it was too rich, too bland, too sweet - you name it.  I really wanted to like this!  Maybe if I had used a fresh cooking pumpkin or squash it would have worked, but as it is, none of the family is willing to try this one again.
And, asking us to stir in the liquid a half cup at a time was extremely messy and time-consuming!  When we make Spanish rice, we just brown the rice and add the whole amount of liquid, cover, and check on it for 20-minutes to add water if necessary.  I won't do it the way the recipe says again.
Ruined some very good feta.
Wish I could try it again - but its a bad memory now.

I loved the end result of this, but I altered the recipe a lot.  I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin because it was in season, 6 cans of veg and chicken broth like some of the reviews had suggested, a whole clove of garlic, and 10 oz of goat cheese instead of 6 feta because I prefer it.  I added a package of shredded parmesan cheese, chicken, and crushed basil.  I did not bake the cheese before adding, or peel the squash.  I mashed half of it before adding like the directions said, but I wish I wouldn't have because with the squash being so tender, it just fell apart anyways and I didn't get any good chunks or color.  I had a few days worth of leftovers and loved eating this every time!

Absolutely delicious meal!  The only changes I made were to use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and to increase the broth by 50%.  It came out creamy and flavorful.  My husband was gushing, which made it well worth the time it took to make.

This was quite good - serves more than four.  I would make again; however, it was a bit time consuming to prepare the pumpkin.  It would definitely make a good "company" dish.

The pumpkin got a little burnt in the oven, so I am going to try again at a lower oven temp. Turned out great most of the family loved it, but my mum didn't like the sharpness of the feta.

This recipe is wonderful, yet know that it isn't kind to short cuts.   This recipe results in rich, deep flavor.     It's a pretty dish, and very satisfying just as it is.    Don't make this if you intend to substitute canned pumpkin for the fresh!!   It just won't work.      Don't add loads of spices without trying the completed dish first.     Know that risotto takes time and attention.  Working with fresh pumpkin is going to take a little time, too.     My advice is to have a glass of wine, turn on some music, and enjoy the process of making this dish.

I used a butternut squash because my grocery store didn't have any fresh pumpkin, but this was AMAZING. I needed a bit more broth to get it the right consistency, but otherwise, made no changes.

This is just wonderful!  I had a similar recipe in a Portland restaurant that used winter squash, gorgonzola, and arugula, which inspired me to make this.  It is absolutely worth the time and lead to a very happy husband.  I sprinkled mine with pine nuts.

I agree that you should count on adding more broth, as I had no more than 4 c. on hand and mine came out a little too dry and a tad too al dente for my taste but this is soooo yummy.  The more feta the better.  I'll be making this one again very soon.  It made a tasty vegetarian main dish.

Just made this for Halloween dinner and it was a huge hit.  I mashed all of the pumpkin and put it in instead of using it as a topping.  It was delicious!

After reading all the reviews, we were really disappointed with this risotto.  We are big risotto eaters in this house because it is usually such a flavorful dish.  This one was just so bland, and the pumpkin flavor was overpowered by the feta flavor.

this recipe was amazing!  but i made a few subtle changes as i felt they would be received better by my skeptical husband who kept saying 'you are making pumpkin what?  isn't pumpkin supposed to be for pie?'...  i pureed all of the pumpkin, added some celery salt, a bit more garlic than the recipe called for, added an extra cube of vegetable stock and mixed all of the feta into the mixture rather than serving it on top as described.  it was delicious (and still is)...

Very good--used butternut squash instead of pumpkin because it was out of season.  Flavors were really good!
