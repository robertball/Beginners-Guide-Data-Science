I've noticed a few comments that it is too 'hot".... please read the recipe... it calls for ONE - finely chopped canned chipotle...... NOT one entire can of them!  LOL.... thanks for the giggle! If you follow the recipe you will end up with a very nice mole!

This is a perfect mole sauce that is so easy! I added one small can of stewed tomatoes because I wanted more sauce, and since I didn't have corriander I used cilantro.  Next time I will omit the sugar because the rasins and peanut butter add enough sweetness.  Half of an adobe chipotle will add the heat to please tender palettes.  I never thought I would make a homemade mole sauce but this was very easy!

I absolutely love mole but am also VERY picky about the quality. This was the closest thing to authentic mole that I have been able to find! Delicious! 
I added 2 circles of mexican chocolate though in place of the other chocolate it calls for and I added some extra peanut butter. This was so easy and tastes FANTASTIC! I had leftover mole for a couple of days and it was still great!

this was so delicious i could not believe i made this !!
i followed the recepipe to a T however i diced up 2 chipotle peppers & used 1 whole "abuelita" chocolate disk (mexican hot chocolate found in the ethnic aisle of youre local grocer)..
ps , if youre debating the peanut butter part, dont hesitate..  my mexican grandmother also used p.b in her mole..
i actually used chicken boneless thighs ( breasts dry out )& threw in 2 drumsticks & the meat fell off the bone sparkling clean...
i served this w/frijoles, white rice & avocado & cilantro garnish....
i will use this recipe forever!

I was so surprised at the tastiness and simplicity of this mole. It really is comparable to other chicken mole dishes that I have enjoyed at authentic mexican restaurants. It was so easy too! We don't have canned chipotle's here, so I added in a fresh jalapeno and some chipotle seasoning and it worked out perfectly. Served with brown rice, plain yogurt (sub for sour cream) and fresh cilantro. Highly recommend this one! We will definitely make again! Thank you!

Very tasty!  Something to consider is that there is no salt in this recipe other than what's contributed by the canned tomatoes, peanut butter, and chipotles.  I used natural peanut butter (as in, one ingredient - peanuts) and low-sodium tomatoes, so added some salt at the end too.  Also, it seemed slightly bitter (probably due to the lack of added sugar in the natural peanut butter), so I stirred in about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, which instantly solved the problem.  Will definitely be making this one again!

Meets ALL criteria!
This was super easy, very filling, economical, and not a calorie-blow. It is one that I will go back to again and again.

One thing I will do differently: saute the onions before putting in the slow cooker. They seemed a little undercooked. Otherwise, it was great!

As close to my favorite Mexican restaurant's recipe as I've found!  A couple of changes for my own preference: I removed the chicken, pureed the sauce with an immersion blender and then added shredded chicken back in.  Next time, I'll use a little chicken broth to thin the sauce to desired consistency.  A great start and extremely easy to make.  I skipped the raisins because I don't like them and used whipped peanut butter (so I did add an extra dash of sugar in the end).  Quite yummy!

This was really tasty! I love mole sauce when we go out for Mexican food. This recipe was just as good as what I order. I shredded the chicken and served it with sour cream and tortilla chips. Delicious! 
NOTE: Dont skip the raisins, they plumped up and gave a nice sweet balance to the spice of the sauce. 
NOTE 2: Dont use the entire car of chipotle chilis. The recipe calls for one and that was enough to give a nice kick but it was not too spicy.

I would give this recipe a 3.5.  I like the level of heat but the other ingredients dont seem to come through. This recipe has excellent potential to be something great but next time I will increase the amount of nutmeg, coriander, and cinnamon.  Hopefully that would give it a greater depth of flavor. In summary, recipe is okay as is could be great with a few adjustments.

Very good! You could spend all day in the kitchen roasting and grinding peppers and spices, simmering, stewing and blending or you could take a few minutes to put these ingredients in the crock pot and get results almost as good.

I made only one change - I had some Mexican chocolate and tossed that in rather than the unsweetened cocoa and sugar. I doubt it really changed the taste.

This is a keeper.

eta: (1) I made this later using cocoa powder instead of Mexican chocolate and, although it was good, it was better with the Mexican chocolate. (2) Don't skip the raisins, they add depth to the flavor. (3) I do prefer to blend it with a hand blender to get a smooth sauce. This also helps if you don't like the texture of the raisins. (4) This is a lot of sauce for the meat. I prefer to cook and add the meat separately - otherwise too much of this yummy sauce would go to waste.  (5) Finally, there is a lot of variation in chili powders and different ones will give different results. They are a mix of  chilies and spices. The right chili powder makes a lot of difference. The last time I made this I had a local chili powder I purchased in Hatch, New Mexico and this was the best yet.

Nice flavour, but very hot.  This was after I removed the chipotle chilis from the adobo sauce as it was very hot on it's own.  We couldn't taste the cocoa and I believe it's supposed to have a chocolate flavour to it?  Nice just the same but I recommend severely reducing the peppers (can size isn't listed in recipe) and increasing cocoa.

we thought this was great--very tasty, healthy and easy.  i love mole, and although this isn't exactly what you get in a good restaurant, we still loved it. i did saute the onions prior to throwing in the crock pot, and added a tablespoon of the adobo sauce for a bit more spice and flavor, and slightly more cinnamon, cumin, coriander, and nutmeg. also added a bit of salt and fresh ground pepper. will definitely be making this again.

I can't believe someone said this tasted like dog food!  I thought it was a fabulous recipe and we are "foodies"!  I usually alter recipes to my liking but I pretty much followed this one closely. Here are my very minor modifications... I don't like things too spicy so I didn't use a chopped pepper.  I just put a tablespoon or two of the adobo sauce in.  ....and it was still plenty spicy!!  I don't think I could have handled it any spicier than it was with just the adobo sauce (unfortunately, my kids couldn't eat it because of the spice). I finely chopped the raisins before I put them in, omitted the sugar and used a natural, unsweetened peanut butter.  I don't think I'd use a Jiff (or sweetened PB in this).  It'd be too sweet!  We served it in corn and flour tortillas.  This will become a staple in our household (esp. in the winter).  I just love delicious crock pot meals!

Yum!  I love mole, and this met my craving.  It was a little more tomato-ey than other moles that I've had, but still really yummy.  I added 2 squared of Mexican chocolate, as a reviewer recommended, and used fresh cilantro instead of coriander because that's all I had.  You can't beat a recipe that you just throw together in a slow cooker and forget about until dinner time!

The flavor is sensational. My crockpot runs hot, so I removed the chicken early, cut it up, and returned it to the mole just to warm before serving. Also, I processed the sauce to make it smoother. This was my first attempt at making mole since I live in Mexico and have many prepared varieties available. I'll make it again during the winter season.

It could use a little more flavoring but was quite good for such an easy recipe. 
I made a paste of all ingredients in the food processor. 
I cooked it on high which might have burnt the chocolate to make it bitter. After reading a helpful review I added 2 tbsps of apple cider vinegar - the bitterness was reduced substantially the next day.  Next time I would lightly fry the onions because the smelled a little raw to me.

Delicious!  I do think that some of the other reviewers are more sensitive to spice than I: I used two chipotle chiles, and plan to use at least 4 next time for a decent level of heat.  I pureed the raisins and chiles in a food processor because I don't love the texture of whole raisins.  I used a bit of the tomato to add liquid.  I specifically used sweetened peanut butter, and did not add sugar, which gave me the perfect sweetness.  Overall, delicious.  I can't wait to make it again!

I made this for Cinco de Mayo work potluck.  I doubled the recipe.  I didn't have any raisins or sesame seeds, but the dish was amazing.  I thought it tasted just like restaurant quality.  Will definitely make this again with probably not as many chipotle chiles.  It was a bit spicy for my boys.

Really easy meal to prepare and really tasty. I cut out the raisins which I don't think effected the flavor at all. The only thing I would note is not to cook this any longer than 5 hours. I left it in the cooker on the lowest setting for almost 6 hours and I thought the chicken was slightly drier than intended.

I don't get the raisins, unless they are just for authenticity. They are a distraction in the dish and make it too sweet. Checking around the web I do find one other chicken mole recipe that uses (just 1/4 cup) raisins. I will leave them out next time. Doubled the chipotele pepper and the heat is just right for most around here. Could go hotter. Next time I will omit the raisins, and pehaps add a tblsp brown sugar.

Very good, though not that similar to other moles I've had. The raisins and spices also made it feel a little South Asian-influenced in a good way. I cut down the peanut butter to 1 TBS, fearing it might dominate. I used a bit more of the adobo sauce for depth of flavor but just one chile and it wasn't too hot. I used a square of baker's chocolate and partway through tasted and added a little cocoa (stronger bite). I sprinkled with sesame seeds and chopped cilantro to serve. Thanks to the original poster--this will go into our regular options.

1 out of 3 tasters was willing to eat more sauce. I am glad I did not put the chicken back into it as it was overwhelming.

Update: I froze individual portions of this with some brown rice for lunches and have found I really like it.  Perhaps the freezing / microwaving intensified the flavours? 

Followed the recipe mostly to a T, but didn't suit my taste buds right when cooked, which I attribute more to just not liking mole all that much.  If I were to try it again, I would add more Chicken - as written it would have been too sloppy for a taco in my opinion.

Super delicious and simple! I wouldn't quite say it tastes restaurant-style (at least not like the restaurants I've had it at), but it's definitely a tasty meal. I used fire-roasted canned tomatoes and it helped bring out the smoky flavor I'm used to in mole, although I didn't use coriander because I wasn't able to find it at my grocery store, for some reason. Still, it turned out fantastic, and I regretted making only half the recipe!

This was really different. My husband and friend really liked it.  It's still up in the air for me.  I served it as a filling for taco shells and soft tortillas heated. We treated it as a filling for those and added sour cream, avacado, ch. onions and grated cheese.  I didn't add the chipotle because I was too lazy to go to the store just for that.  But I did add chipotle seasoning and a little chili pepper.

Five stars for simplicity. Three stars for overall flavor made as directed. Flavors were a bit bitter and lacked the sweetness of the mole I am accustomed to. After sampling the mole, I added a couple more tablespoons of peanut butter and sugar and a half teaspoon more of the cinnamon and it helped immensely. I also pureed the sauce in my food processor because I did not care for the chunky texture. My crockpot cooks pretty fast so this was done in 4 hours. Any longer and the chicken would have turned to dust. I will try this one again with my changes. BTW his made alot of mole sauce so I think you could either cut it in half or double the amount of chicken to use up the sauce. I froze the leftover mole to use in the future. Thanks for sharing!

swapped the meat for quorn and lowered the heat to match those eating it. also left out the sugar as another review suggested.
It went down really well, this will be made again, hopefully with a higher chilli level. >
made this again, this time to the original recipe , still 5 stars :)

Tried it last night without altering the recipe (didn't have any raisins though)
I think I would make it again but with the following changes:
-no breast meat. Too dry, needs to b thigh or drumstick
- less peanut butter or maybe peanut sauce instead, I thought it added a tacky mouth feel that added to the dryness
-add some salt
-add an acidic agent, lime juice or vinegar.

Overall the flavors were nice and the heat level was good (with just one adobe pepper)

Used one and a half discs of Mexican chocolate from Oaxaca and used an immersion blender to make sauce smooth. It was pretty good, but just seems to need a little something, maybe different peppers or more nuts. Overall, it is definitely worth trying.

We enjoyed this recipe very much. In the middle of a busy day, I threw it together and we were so impressed we could hardly wait for dinner. We paired it with Mexican rice and I cooked up some Chayote squash as a side veggie. Will definitely cook again --even for guests. I used thigh meat,  3 packets of Splenda for the sugar, and added !/2 teas. instant coffee (cause I've seen other recipes with coffee). I cut the meat up into bite-sized pieces. This recipe makes plenty of sauce, so the sauce-to-chicken ratio is generous. Next time I will process the raisins before adding.

Super easy and tasty. Made with pork instead of chicken, which added an extra sweetness, so I left the sugar out. I was confused by the raisins and didn't put them in- if I'm missing something huge, somebody please share! Thank you for a recipe that tastes... like Mole I would get in an American restaurant!

I had just purchased a turkey breast when I came across this recipe.  My husband and I really enjoyed the complexity of flavors.  I did substitute honey for the sugar, used Mexican chocolate instead of the cocoa and added 2 chipotles for extra spiciness.  Thanks for a delicious and easy mole recipe.

This turned out sweeter than I was expecting and I followed the recipe to a T. (But don't get me wrong, it still turned out pretty tasty.) However, I did take out half the seeds from the chipotle, but I wound up not tasting the chipotle at all. Next time I'll probably add two half seeded chipotle peppers, a mexican chocolate disk instead of coco powder, and maybe a pinch of black pepper.

I love this recipe! The only thing different I do is nuke the raisins with 1/2 cup of the tomatoes for 4 minutes to soften them. Then put that I the blender with the chilies and purée before I put it in the crock. It make a smother sauce as I don't care to eat the whole raisin, but like the flavor it ads! I also add 1/4 cup semi sweet choc chips for the sweetness instead of the sugar, it ads to the richness!

Super easy but very hot as i misread the chili peppers instructions (tho what am i going to do with the rest of the can?). I'm backing down to 1 tbsp of chili powder next time too and maybe up the cocoa powder. looking forward to another go at it! 

(i see folks noting the discrepancy on the chili peppers. it's easy to misunderstand and apparently even easier to be mean about the misunderstanding. lighten up!)

Not good, but based on the other reviews, I must have messed something up.  The unsweetened cocoa flavor was overwhelming.  So much so that the after taste was horrible.  Probably will not try again.

That description about the one chili out of a can was written poorly, as I can see by the comments.  I love spicy food, and put the entire 7 oz. can in. It was smoking hot, but has good flavor.  I made soft tacos with it and dampened the spice with rice, Greek yogurt (sub for sour cream) and a little cheese.  Shred lettuce and then the spice level was really good.  I also shredded the 2 whole chicken breasts on a cutting board, so it wasn't overloaded with hot sauce.  It made a ton of sauce.  I am going to make this again, next time starting with 2 peppers out of the can, and use about 3 whole chicken breasts in the slow cooker.

Very good recipe. A lot of flavors. 
I've put 1/4 of the chili powder hoping my 2 years old could eat it and was still to spicy for her (and perfect for me)

Great mole recipe but I feel like it needed a bit more bite and a bit more sweetness. Next time I will try another user's suggestion to use real chocolate instead of cocoa powder (I'm picturing chili-infused dark chocolate, yum) and add a couple more chipotle peppers. But we like our food spicy, so if you don't, one pepper is probably fine for you.

Didn't change a thing and it was really good. I love chicken mole so it was nice to be able to make it from scratch. Next time I think the only change I would make is to take the advice of some others her and process the sauce with a hand blender to make it smoother.

no nutmeg... has potential but I think the flavor would be better stove top. The onions stayed crunchy and it didn't get the dark rich mole color. I actually added 2 more teaspoons of sugar to try and get the chocolate to come through. Sauce to meat ratio is way off. Could easily double the meat. I ended up throwing in some left-over rotisserie chicken in the end because there was just too much sauce that was going to go to waste. I think it could also go with two chipotle peppers.

I also mistakenly added the whole can of chipotles the first time I made it, and then decided to use juste one quarter of the chili powder, for I felt it was going to be too much... It still came out hot, but good!  Second time I did it the right way (1 chipotle and complete amount of the chili powder) and it came out better!  Still both times my family and I loved the recipe, it is the simplest, easiest recipe for an authentic taste mole that I've ever tried!

This is awfully good for being a simple slow cooker recipe.  It makes a LOT of sauce, so you could use substantially more chicken if you wanted.  I needed to add extra cocoa powder, chipotle and salt to make it zing.  I also rehydrated a dried ancho pepper and threw it into the mix.  This made it feel more authentic.   After close to 4 hours simmering on low, I took the chicken out and used an immersion blender to mix things better.  One last thing: I used boneless chicken thighs so that they wouldn't dry out.  They came out SO tender.  Yum!

This was awesome! I used pork instead of chicken. I shredded the pork about 3/4 of the way through cooking.  A little spicy for me but maybe that's because I added the rest of the adobo sauce from the one (and only) pepper. I served it with tortillas and basically made burritos.

Smelled amazing, but the flavor was flat, like there was something missing. I added a bunch of salt which helped a little bit, but I still had to put salsa and raw onions on top to liven it up. Would not make again

This was  such a simple yet delicious mole!  If you can find the Mexican chocolate it will definitely enhance the flavor!  Just pop all ingredients into the slow cocker and 5 hours later you are ready to eat a delicious meal!  The only change I made was I didn't add the sesame seeds since I didn't have them in the house.  If you song like heat cut back on the chipotle pepper...use half instead of a whole one.  Will definety make this again.

I don't understand how anyone could think this was sweet, it didn't have any chocolate taste to it. Maybe I'm use to the mole I get here in Phoenix, but I added Mexican chocolate. I also ended up adding one more chipotle chile, and I'm a whimp when it comes to heat.
Next time I will put all the ingred. (except the chicken) into the blender, so it more resembles the mole I am use to eating.

At the time I made this (a) there were very limited places to go for these peppers (b) it was my first slow-cooker meal

Now I know where to go and I am going to redo the recipe correctly! 

It was good but I think if I followed the recipe, it would be perfect!

tasty and only used 1/2 of one chipotle in the can.  My preschoolers liked it very much with yogurt and guacamole.

My husband and I didn't really like this. I am sure it is not the recipe just the combination of flavors. I think that you have to have the right taste buds for this.

I'm very sorry... but this was TERRIBLE! My husband and I could barely eat it and we threw away the left overs. It was extremely bitter, overly spicy, and had way too much of a tomato flavor for mole. It lacks the complexity of good mole which I suppose shouldn't be suprising since it is a simple recipe. I was really looking forward to being able to make mole at home, too.

A pretty decent mole recipe.  It could use more cocoa or some dark chocolate, but the taste overall is pretty close to the real thing.  Great job!

It is common to put raisins and sesame seeds in mole.  Every mole cook does theirs differently.  Some even put in burnt toast. I don't think 3 tbs. of cocoa is too much because there is a lot of tomato added.  However, we never use tomato.  I recommend Better Than Bouillon Chicken Broth paste with water.  (no MSG).  Unless you are brought up with mole , it may be difficult to get it right the first time.  The sauce should cook for at least 30 minutes on the stove top unless you are using a slow cooker.  I would recommend to saute the onions in a little oil then add all the spices at once to make a roux, then add the broth.  You might want to add more broth, a little at a time.  Don't give up.  Try again until you find out how to make it to your taste.  I like mine sweet unlike my hubby so I squirt a little agave onto mine after it is served up and leave out the raisins.

I love mole and make it all the time.  This recipe had me curious -- raisins and sesame seeds seemed so odd, so curiosity got the best of me.  I made exactly as written and it was terrible -- tastes nothing like mole should.  Bland, flavorless and the raisins -- well, my initial reaction to that in here was spot on.  The other thing that made it not mole was the overpowering tomatoes.  Needed much more spice.  Like other reviewers, I was glad I made the sauce separately and did not ruin my chicken.  The sauce was not salvageable.  No, I will not be making this recipe again -- it needs so much adjusting just start with a new recipe folks.

The only reason I gave it one less star is because I didn't find it hot enough - not at all, not anywhere close.  

I will be adding the entire can of chipotle and I will add a decent amount of red chile powder (only NM red, of course).  Mole should have a kick.  I can't even tell you the amount I've laughed at those who thought it was "too hot".....uh....

I read another recipe and combined these two and the other one said to add the whole can---too spicy! My husband was skeptical about mole because its too chocolatey, but now he is a believer! Great recipe overall! 
P.S. don't forget to blend up the sauce components if you want a silky smooth sauce.

This was absolutely outstanding. I did not add a can of Chipotle as I found the instructions quite clear but did up the space a little with Jalapenos (no Chipotle here in Cambodia). As others, I also shredded the chicken and put it back in the sauce for a few minutes.

My Cambodian family loved it and they want to eat it again this weekend.....

This recipe is very easy and has great flavor. I didn't add the raisins so I added a little extra (a pinch) of sugar. I also used Mexican chocolate instead of cocoa powder. Served it with fresh tortillas and some cilantro rice. Family loved it.

It came out pretty good. It's missing a bit of salt for balance - I used old fashioned unsalted pb so maybe that's the reason it came out bland? The recipe didn't indicate if salted pb was ok or not so I used unsalted...Also even though I had doubled the recipe (3lbs of chicken!) it cooked in under 4hrs. Slow cookers vary I guess...its best to check if meat's internal temperature reached 165F. Mine came out a bit dry because by the time I checked it was 185F.

I'll be making this again! The only change I made was to use the whole can of chiles in adobo as I like things spicy. It was not too spicy. The chicken was so tender and flavorful. I'm glad I made the whole recipe so I have leftovers to enjoy over the next couple of days. It also made my house smell so good!

Great recipe!  

I added another teaspoon of sugar and 1 more chipotle chile  to achieve the sweet and spicy flavour I wanted for my mole sauce. I also shredded the chicken breast and served it as filling for tacos. It was a huge hit!

I'm a mole fan, and this recipe is definitely a keeper. Knowing my family's taste, doubled the chili powder an added a little ancho chili,  cut back a bit on the tomatoes. Was about perfect quantity for eight meaty thighs, and still not very spicy. Very similar to the mole at my favorite (authentic) Mexican restaurant.

I made this according to the recipe except for the sesame seeds (I didn't have any).  The flavor was very good.  We had it in tortillas.  The only thing I would change next time is to add a little more cocoa powder for that chocolate flavor.  Other than that, we enjoyed it very much.

I have tasted many different kinds of mole and this one isn't the best but it is flavorful.  I added two peppers and about two tablespoons of the sauce from the can.  The mole isn't as rich as I am used to and I think it would benefit from using a disk of mexican chocolate instead of unsweetened chocolate. I also suggest blending the mole sauce until smooth. Traditional mole is not chunky.  I will make it again and I think it would be great as enchilada sauce too. Thanks for the recipe.

Chicken mole has always been one of my favorites although I have never made it.  I made this recipe exactly as written and it was amazing. Lots of compliments. Looking forward to the leftovers.  This recipe is a keeper.

You have got to make this!!!! This was so good, and probably perfect as written, but I used skinless-boneless chicken thighs for a richer chicken flavor and because we like a bit more pizzazz I added 3 chipotle  peppers in all of their lovely sauce.  I also removed the thighs when they were cooked through, blended all of the sauce's ingredients to help smooth out the sauce, then shredded the chicken and placed back in with the Mole sauce.  This recipe will be my go to Chix and Mole from here on out.

This was delicious. Next time I will precook the onions in the microwave, either in a bit of water or with a bit of oil and salt (about 5 minutes) I thought they were a bit crunchy and undercooked.

I loved this and my 11 year old daughter loved it, too.  I used two chiles from the can - the first one seemed kind of small - and it wasn't too hot. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  I used 4 chicken breasts (my scale is being used in a science project so it was unavailable).  We got 3 dinners out of it!  Can't wait to make it again :)

I have made this recipe several times because it has great flavor and is super easy. The only thing I try differently each time is the amount of chipolte peppers because the first time I did like others and used the whole can which made it very hot, I found that using half the can with the sauce gives it just the right amount of heat/spice. This recipe has become a staple, thank yoU!!

really like this version, very easy way to make mole at home.  I skipped sugar and raisins since I used another reviewer's suggestion to use mexican chocolate disks.  I had them in cupboard and they were sweet enough to add the flavor.  I did use a little cocoa powder too, I personally like the extra chocolate flavor.  I actually just made the sauce, cooked chicken separate and made enchiladas, very tasty!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy but too spicy for me. I think the three teaspoons of chilli powder is just as likely a culprit. Obviously it depends what kind of chilli powder you use. I added two (heaped) teaspoons and wish I'd only added one. I'd recommend other people just start off with one teaspoon and then add extra chilli at the end to taste. I also added a few squares of chocolate and was heavy-handed with the cocoa powder to give it a stronger chocolatey taste.

I was trying this out for the first time yesterday.  I happened to be making a double batch so I could freeze half for another meal, which worked out well because I ended up with unexpected company for dinner (my mom/stepdad and my brother/SIL).  

We had more that enough with the extra, but with three big men, three mamas, and couple of kids, a single batch would not have fed everyone.  True there is a lot of extra mole sauce, but I saved it and will use over grilled chicken breasts or something like that.
 
Anyway, everyone raved about the dinner and my SIL wants the recipe.  

Changes I made:
-Used half boneless chicken breast, half boneless chicken thighs
-Used chunky peanut butter (it is what we had on hand)
-Used half regular chili powder/half ancho chili powder (already had it in the cupboard and figured it was a good a time as any to use some up)
-Took out the chicken and mixed the mole with an immersion blender about an hour before completion (then added the chicken back in to finish cooking)
-Shredded the chicken for serving

We had this with small corn tortillas, queso blanco, avocado, yellow rice, and sour cream.  Also a nice green salad on the side.

Delicious dinner that the hole family really liked.  I used two big chicken breasts, shredded them, and served the whole thing over rice.  I'm always looking for good slow-cooker recipes and this one is a keeper.  I also like that its a shorter cooking time, too.

This recipe made good foundation for making my mole.  I used a bar of dark chocolate, a rotesserie chicken, the whole can of chiles, and probably three times the other spices to get it to tasete right to me.  But then we loved it!

My family really loved it, but I didn't prefer it (this is weird since I'm the one who loves everything).  It was good, just not my favorite.  I felt like it could use a little something, just didn't know what. This was my firs time making a mole though.  I will certainly try again.

I had to leave the chipotle out of this for my preschooler, so it was a bit bland - not the recipe's fault!  I think I would decrease the tomatoes; the sauce wasn't as rich as I was hoping for. Still, pretty good. We ate it in tacos and I think we'll freeze the leftovers to use in enchiladas. Probably won't make again, though. Thanks anyway!

I doubled this recipe for a big group tonight and got rave reviews. The flavor is strong and rich as written, and there was lots of extra sauce, which was nice and thick, making it all great over rice.  Next time I make it I plan to increase the peanut butter and chocolate/cocoa to counter the slightly tart flavor that I assume comes from the tomatoes.  Thanks for a delicious and easy crockpot recipe!

Great recipe!  I noticed the comments about spiciness, so I used just one chipotle pepper for my first time.  I think I'll use 2 next time and see how spicy it is.  But the flavor is wonderful!  Thank you!

Absolutely wonderful recipe. Husband loved it. I doubled the  Chipotle chili peppers and also the cocoa. Added the chicken breasts partially frozen and cooked on low for 8 hours instead of 5. Will make this again when we have guests!!!

I found the taste to be kind of bland. 
I used natural peanut butter and unsalted tomatoes, and so I added 1 tsp of salt, but maybe more would have helped. 
My husband and I will use up the leftovers, but I won't be making it again.

Loved this recipe!  Followed the ingredients exactly (using just ONE chipotle chile, not the whole can, LOL).  At the 4-hour mark, pulled out the chicken, shredded it with 2 forks, and used an immersion blender on the sauce to make it smooth.  Returned the shredded chicken to the sauce for the last hour.   The recipe had a small amount of heat which was just right for me - others might want to increase the number of chipotle chiles used.  Definitely a keeper!

I blended everything for the sauce instead of mixing it in as directed, and it turned out really well.

The recipe mentions eating it with tortillas and that's what we did, but it would have gone better with beans and rice.

I would make it again but use more cocoa and very little if any of the canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. This recipe looks like it calls for the whole can (its a small can) So I used that, no other hotness added. I could tell this had great flavor but I could hardly enjoy it because it was so hot I could hardly eat it, and I like spicy. So there will be a next time and will omit the chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.

I made this  jan 6 for my mole freak friends and me. It was so good!! We all went NUTS. I doubled the recipe so there would be leftovers.  We are all glad I did..we ate mole chicken all week. I am going to make more sauce to have handy and give to my friends!

It smells like mole sauce, but didn’t really taste like it to me. I also decided to use a stick blender after it was cooked (after removing the chicken) because chunks of onion and raisins doesn’t say “mole” to me.

I didn't use the sesame seeds but did opt for a disk of Mexican chocolate instead of the coco powder. The BF forgot to turn off the cooker so it ran on low for about nine hours...it didn't seem to hurt it. I shredded the breasts because even sliced I think they would have been a bit dry. It was a little bitter alone, but salt helped. I think once you put it in a tortilla or on a chip with lime or avocado the flavor will mellow. I only used one chipotle but could have easily put in more.  Thank you!

This turned out pretty good; but I did have to add a few things just for our personal preferences. I made it exactly as written, and then sampled it after it had cooked. I ended up adding in some molasses, extra peanut butter, and upped the spices. I also think blending the sauce would be better than leaving it chunky (again, that's just personal preference). For the ease of throwing it in the crock pot and forgetting about though, it deserves at least 4 stars. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exactly as written and it was absolutely phenomenal. After cooking, I did choose to add about 1/2, maybe almost 1 tsp of kosher salt. Other than that, my only changes for next time will be to dice the onion smaller and run the raisins through a quick dice, too, they plumped back up during the cooking process which made for a (to me) weird consistency experience. Also, since I like spicy, I always keep a bag of canned chipotle w/adobo sauce in the freezer that I've run through a food processor. Next time, I might add a little more. I shredded my chicken before adding back into the sauce for an hour or so. This amount of sauce can easily support 2 lbs chicken. I will definitely be making this often, it's hard to find a decent mole where I am and this was so easy and tasted incredibly authentic! I served in tortillas enchilada-style with sliced avocados on top. Yum!

This is a fantastic recipe! My husband lived in Mexico for several years & loves real Mexican food, mole being one of his absolute favorites. I, on the other hand, could not figure out what in the world he was so enchanted by with mole. I didn’t like it at all until now!

My partner liked it but I will definitely be changing some of the recipe: no Dutch cocoa but real chocolate,  increase peanut butter, less cinnamon,  and using roasted chilies.

I will make it again.  Didn't have the sesames seeds, so left them out.  I used a can of chopped green chilies instead of the chipotle and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs rather than chicken breasts.  It was very good, but will try to use the chipotle chile to add more heat next time.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it was delicious, and even my mole aficionado husband thought it was great and authentic.  Next time I will more than likely cut the recipe in half because I had so much mole left over.  However, the mole did freeze really well and I have used it with some shredded left over chicken and it worked really well.

I am cooking it. I stopped to read the reviews after I had put everything on the crockpot. I read the ingredient for chipotle. I read it three or four times. I wasn't sure it meant one whole can or one piece. I put in the whole can. Now, I am going to have really SPICY mole. I think it would clear if it said one piece of chipotle pepper from the can. 
Any suggestions, to lessen the spicyness?

Pretty good - I wimped out and only used 1/2 of a chipotle pepper for fear of over-spicing the kids, but it could really have used the whole pepper as it needed both a bit more spice and a bit more flavor.  Served with cilantro-lime rice, tortillas, and avocados for a DIY bowl/taco/plate night.  Family-approved!

This was my first experience of mole sauce and it was delicious. Very interesting. The only change was I didn't have the pepper, so just omitted it. I prefer mild heat anyway and the chili powder was plenty.

I was looking for something different to do with chicken in my slow cooker and this turned out great!  The only change I made was to use 2 teaspoons of cocoa/chili powder blend instead of 4 tablespoons of chili powder, because my daughter was visiting and she doesn't like her food very spicy.   I did also use the plain cocoa powder as directed.  I shredded the chicken and served it with soft corn tortillas.  The next day I ate some of the leftovers over plain white rice.  While my version was not at all spicy, the flavors were still so rich and satisfying!  The next time I make it (and there will definitely be a next time) I plan on upping the heat factor by using the full amount of chili powder.

This was an amazing  dish. Served on warm tortillas with lettuce, tomato, salsa, avocado slices, hot sauce and sour cream. Mexican style rice on the side. Really amazing depth of flavor. So many things going on that work well together. This recipe is saved!

I can eat just about anything but i couldnt eat this. I followed the recipe but this was not good. Maybe its just not my taste but i recommend that if you were born and rased in the south, you skip this one. I dont think bacon would even fix this recipe.

I didn't make any changes it was a huge hit and a bonus it that it freezes well.   I used fresh corn tortillas and added fresh chopped cilantro, green onion, fresh squeezed lime, chopped avocado and a little cheese.  Yum!

I made the recipe with chicken thighs because that's my preference.  I cooked it for 4 hours and they came out perfectly.  I'm a hot head and used 3 chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and added some of the sauce.  The heat level was slight higher than medium and I could have added more. The mole was dark with good seasoning but too sweet for me.  I love sweet and savory but this was not a pleasant sweet.  The raisins seemed to overpower the dish.  Next time, I'll leave those out.  For some reason, the onions were under cooked, maybe because I only cooked the dish for 4 hours.  Overall, it's a keeper.

I also substituted a can of jalapeños with extra chipotle chili seasoning,  I also used craisins instead of raisins (didn’t want to go to the store).  It’s delicious - but don’t overdo the chili powder.  It was a bit spicy for my taste but others liked it.  Easily fixed next time.  Thanks for an easy but different recipe!

Delicious and simple recipe.  I added a little chicken broth to stretch it. I made  it twice in one week, the 2nd time to take to a potluck dinner.  I will be making this easy dish often.

Simply put, this recipe was extremely simple to make and very tasty. The whole family loved it. Shredded the chicken and served street taco style on corn tortillas. I'll be making this again.

This has wonderful flavor.  For those who don't like raisins-this recipe really needs them for a layer of fruitiness that gives extra depth to this sauce as well as making it authentic. I used an immersion blender to give it a smooth texture and I didn't notice the raisins but did notice that rich flavor.  I didn't have sesame seeds handy and wasn't sure what they would add flavor-wise but just in case, I added a teaspoon of tahini (sesame seed paste). I had some Mexican chocolate on hand so I used that and didn't add any sugar.  I also didn't add any chicken but just made a big ol' pot of sauce and cooked the chicken separately. So far I have made mole soft tacos and chicken mole enchiladas and still had enough sauce left over to freeze for a future yummy dish.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper! (Oh, and please note-the recipe only calls for ONE chili in adobo sauce, not a whole can.  This was just right for me but if you like hot you might want to use 2)

This was pretty good! I left out the single chili, because we're spice wimps, but I suspect we could have handled it and I may put it in next time just to see. I sauteed the onion first, because I generally prefer that in recipes, and am often dissatisfied with the results of tossing unsauteed onion into the pot. Used bone-in leg quarters and served it with rice. I agree with the folks advising not to skip the raisins, they add a nice bit to the flavor. Will make again, possibly add a bit more of the various spices.

There is a very similar recipe in ATK's "Slow Cooker Revolution."  I had both in front of me; mostly followed this, but did combine the onions, chili powder, cocoa, a bit of oil and microwaved for 5 min as in "SCR."  This started things off hot, useful since I had only four hours!  Used thin cut breasts for that reason, shredded them.  I used 2 chipotles and would use more next time.  Hubby says best mole I've ever made.

I would not call this authentic mole sauce but my authentic mexican wife loved it. I feel it could use something extra to get it closer to authentic but the family loved this one.  It is a good alternative to making homemade mole how they do it Mexico. A good greengo recipe.

This was one of the best slow cooker recipes I have made.  The sauce is unreal.  Others have said that they thought it was too spicy, but we like it that way.  I even added an extra chipotle pepper -- keep in mind that they are at least 6 in a can so don't use the whole can if you don't want it hot!  I used 2 1/2 peppers in my batch.  I served it over rice, with some fresh sliced avocado and squeezed a little fresh lime juice on it.  Will definitely be making this one again.

This was a very quick and easy recipe to throw together.  I've never had chicken mole before, so didn't know what to expect.  The peanut butter and cocoa powder in the recipe sounded intriguing.   I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I would add 1 more chipotle pepper, or use a larger one, and double the garlic.  This fit perfectly into my 4 quart slow cooker.

Really good and so authentic.  Such a great easy recipe for a very complex dish.  I did shred the chicken during last hour of cooking as was suggested.  And used tortillas as the delivery system.  Also snuck in one extra chili from the adobe sauce.....

Original mole call for  ancho, mulato, pasilla, and chiplote peppers.  You oversimplify  a traditional, very old, and complex mexican recipe.

This turned out so great! I put this all together in a gallon ziplock bag the night before cooking this so all I had to do was throw it in the slow cooker during a busy day. Changes I made: I didn’t measure the peanut butter, just three in a big spoonful and it may have been on the short side. Also, shortened the cocoa powder by 1/2 teaspoon or so. Lastly, instead of the chipotle pepper, I used chipotle powder - 1/2 teaspoon is the equivalent. This was really great with a tortilla, refried beans, and cilantro lime rice.

Excellent Recipe
To get it spicy and sweet i used 2 cans of chipotle peppers, 2 cans of tomatoes and more raisins. I also used unsweetened dark chocolate powder a whole garlic and enough spices to get the desired flavor and loved it.

Really good, really easy.  Made pretty much exactly as directed, except  maybe I was a little heavy-handed with the cocoa, as it was a little bitter until I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar.  Very tasty.

I love mole but could never find the right recipe to make because it was too complex.  This recipe is perfect and it is as authentic as Mole Poblano without the complexity of making it.  It wasn't too hot for me since I am used to eating most foods with spice.  Will make it again and again.

I was disappointed by this recipe.  I made it exactly as written and after 5 hours of slow cooking, it had a bitter taste like a few other reviewers had mentioned.  I was hoping that with all the spices and other ingredients, the flavor would really transform and develop- it did not.  I will keep looking for a quality mole recipe!

Thought this dish had great flavor.  We didn't have all of the ingredients so had to make do with others (substituted unsweetened bakers chocolate for the cocoa powder and diced tomatoes for crushed).  If you do have to use diced tomatoes rather than crushed, recommend you remove the chicken breasts after cooking and blend the cooked down sauce, then add the chicken back in and shred.  We didn't and wish we would have.  But the taste was still wonderful anyway.

Tasted ok but needed more heat. I only used one chili. And it needed salt. If I make it again I will use less onion, more chipotle, and more cocoa.

Too much peanut butter flavor and odd mix of spices. Hoping it's better on day 2 but won't be making it again :( shucks

While not as good as mole I have had in restaurants, this is very good.  I wish it was a little bit spicier.

Great base for mole. I doubled the spice and added green chiles. Very easy and delicious over rice.

This was my first time making chicken mole,and I must say THANK YOU so much for sharing this wonderful recipe! I did add a bit more PB, Chipotle peppers and shredded the chicken (my family loves spicy foods)but other than those few tweaks,  I followed the recipe to the T. Super Delicious :)

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I've had mole at a restaurant before and enjoyed it, but I did not care for this. I followed the recipe except I skipped the chile as I can't handle the heat. It was however a good texture and consistency, I used chicken stirfry meat and it broke up and mixed well with the sauce.
