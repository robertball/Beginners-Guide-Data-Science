I have to be careful when I cook because of Hubs' sensitive innnards. When I put together tonight's menu around this chicken I was less than enthusiastic, expecting something dull and nondescript.  Not.  This was wonderful - tender, moist (I just cooked it a straight 25 minutes at 425 degrees) and exploding with flavor.  A perfect meal, complemented with "Lemon Fried Rice," and "Almond Broccoli Stir Fry," also from this site. Just another recipe as proof that you don't need to mask the flavor of your original ingredient with spices to make it darn delicious, just on its own, with nothing more, really, than a little butter, salt and pepper and lemon juice.  I'll hang on to this one.

This was a different and delicious way to fix chicken!  The only change I made was to cut the chicken into smaller pieces to make it stretch for last minute guests and added a few more sesame seeds, since we really like them.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks!

I found a recipe in a church cookbook that was very close to this one.  The only difference was to add more garlic and tarragon to the butter mixture and use more sesame seeds and no parmesan.  So, I did those changes and it was wonderful.  I'm sure this recipe would be equally as good.  I'm saving it to my recipe file.  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent, easy & quick!  I pound chicken breasts prior to cooking & marinating it in buttermilk always yields a juicy tender baked chicken when using a coating.  Sometimes I find that a bit extra salt is needed in the breading when using a buttermilk soak.  A knife definitely was not needed. I did enjoy the lemon/garlic/butter/sesame flavor but could not taste the Parmesan. Watch timing with the seeds when browning.  The butter mixture can also burn if flows off the chicken with any extra breading.  Will definitely use this recipe again but will likely add more garlic, lemon and sesame seeds.  This is a keeper.

I marinated the chicken breasts for several hours then baked it and the results were fantastic! The chicken was moist, tender and flavorful. The chicken was so delicious, very soft and practically melted in my mouth. The buttermilk is obviously the reason why the chicken turned out so moist. The zing of lemon in the chicken breading was a pleasant surprise. The breading is light and slightly crispy-perfect! While I could taste the garlic, lemon, parmesan cheese flavors, it was not overpowering at all. This is just a couple of simple easy ingredients for such a fresh and scrumptious dish. This was a pleasant surprise compared to plain baked chicken breasts. I served this entrée with, “Lemon Fried Rice,” and “Asian-Style Zucchini,” also from All Recipes website.

I so wanted to like this recipe.  I made it exactly as stated except I cut the chicken into strips before marinating.  I thought it was bland.  A bit of sesame flavor come out, but also slightly chewy exterior from the sesame seeds.  Chicken was juicy, but I can marinate chicken in buttermilk, dry it, sprinkle sesame seeds on it and get the same thing I would think without all of the other work, ingredients, dishes and cost.

This is a 5 star chicken.  I didn't change a thing.  I took Naples advice and let the natural flavors come through.  The chicken breasts I picked up today were huge!  I soaked them in buttermilk for 4 hours as recommended and the results were the moistest chicken breast ever.  The only thing I did different is I broiled them for a few minutes to brown them up a bit more before serving.  Delicious!

Decent easy dish...  Would half the breadcrumbs and double the sesame seeds for more flavor, add taragon, triple the garlic and double the lemon and cheese. : ) Yummy

Tasted good, but it is very dry. If I ever will make it again, I will make small chicken pieces as appetizer...

I love this sesame chicken!  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I followed the suggestions of other recipes and added more garlic and more sesame seeds.

I am giving this 5 stars because we really enjoyed this.  I even messed it up and it came out amazing.  I would add some extra garlic and use chicken tenders instead.  Actually I am thawing out 2 packages of tenders right now because I am making it again.  Great way to use up left over buttermilk.  Definte keeper in our book!  I think this would make a great appetizer as well.

Thanks to the buttermilk, the chicken was certainly tender. There was a lot of buttery drippings after it was done baking; a guilty pleasure. But for some reason, my experience was different than the other reviewers: we found the chicken pretty bland. Nothing to rave about.

Very nice!  I used powdered buttermilk & water, and let it soak overnight.  Substituted panko for breadcrumbs (I think I might have to toss the dried breadcrumbs in my cupboard for panko all the time - the difference is amazing!).  After drizzling the remaining butter over the chicken, I sprinkled the remaining crumb mixture over.  Baked on a rack over a foil covered pan at 400* (convection) for 20 minutes.  Chicken was juicy and the topping was wonderfully light & crispy.  I used toasted sesame seeds for part of the measured amount - I think toasting all of the sesame seeds would bring the flavor out even more.  Definite keeper!

So...  needed a direction for oven baked chicken (breasts on the bone) and this one was perfect.  I didn't have the buttermilk in my fridge (wish i did) so i skipped that step and had to bake for closer to 45 minutes due to not using boneless breasts.  The only thing I'd do different is leave it in the oven at 400 for maybe an extra 5 minutes to get it slightly brown on top, then turn down the oven to 350.  It was VERY tasty and don't forget to drizzle the extra butter on top.. that part makes it even more yummy.

Great recipe! Didn't have buttermilk on hand so skipped that step but the results were still delicious! Also added more garlic, sesame seeds and some basil just because we love basil.

This was delicious!  I used chicken tenders, because that's what was in the frige - and only had to cook them the 10 min. plust 5 min at the lower temp.  I didn't marinate the chicken more than 10 min. due to time constraints.  But it was so delicious!  Even my very reluctant 11 year old said they were good -  the other 6 people in the house said they were great and my 8 year old wants the recipe!  These flavors blend well but nothing is overpowering.  I think the pieces would go well with a salad of spring greens, mandarine oranges, and a light dressing.  The only problem I had was I didn't make enough.

I have been searching for a good recipe for chicken breasts for years. Usually, the breast meat is too dry for my liking so I stick to dark meat, which is less healthy. However, I served this last night and my family loved it...and so did I! I followed the directions exactly. The buttermilk marinade made the white meat moist and the sesame seeds in the coating added a really nice flavor. This is a keeper. Thanks Anne!

Very tasty.  The sesame seeds give a little different slant on chicken cutlets.  I had cut the chicken breasts horizontally to obtain the maximum flavor from the buttermilk and bread crumbs.  Although we liked this very much, I would slightly decrease the amount of bread crumbs the next time.

Delicious and my husband agreed! I used 8 chicken cutlets (thin sliced chicken breast equaling 4 breast halves) with no other changes. The hint of lemon behind the sesame breading was pleasant. This dish is simple in taste and doesn't need to be "jazzed" up. It's great as is. I placed the cutlets on foil on a cookie sheet and the bottoms did stick somewhat. Next time I will use releasing foil. Will be making this dish again without a doubt. I believe soaking them in the buttermilk helped to make them tender as well as moist.

I really enjoyed this chicken dish because it has nice flavor with each bite! I didn't have buttermilk so I used heavy cream and replaced the butter/margarine with olive oil. I'll tweak anything I can just to improve the health quality of the dish. I used Bolthouse Farms Caesar Parmigiano Dressing (yogurt based - found in the refrigerated veggie section) as a dip for the chicken. Next time, I will cut the chicken into pieces and toss inside a wrap with lettuce, tomatoes and dressing. You can't taste the sesame seeds so I suggest doubling if you prefer the flavor. It will seem like far too many, but trust me you'll need that amount to get the flavor. Either way you prepare this dish, it's a hit!

Tasty and very easy to make.  Didn't change a thing.  Will make again.
