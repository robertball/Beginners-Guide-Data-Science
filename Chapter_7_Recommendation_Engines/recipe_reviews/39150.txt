The top layer did not set up.  It was also too sweet.  Would not make it again.

When I first read this recipe, I wasn't sure about trying it.  Parts of the recipe seemed odd.  Then, when we did try it, it was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving!  The varying textures of the crust and topping went well together, as did the flavors of butterscotch and pumpkin (to my surprise).  The cookies are also appealing to the eye and would be great for giving away.  Try them!  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.  (However, I put walnuts in the crust and sprinkled on top but omitted them from the topping itself.)

Really yummy recipe, but too rich for my taste.  I also thought the butterscotch flavor WAY overpowered the pumpkin -- you couldn't even taste it.  Also, my "topping" never really thickened up properly. . . it ended up sort of oozing over the edges of the bars after they were cut.  Everybody said they tasted great anyway, but I will probably not make these again.

I had a pumpkin party at my house and most of my guests really liked this. I thought that it was kind of rich, but, still good.
