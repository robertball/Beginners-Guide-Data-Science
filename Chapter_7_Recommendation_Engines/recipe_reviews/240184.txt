The flavor was good but I had to let this sit for over 3 days in my fridge for it to even set up.  Kids didn't mind eating it with a spoon prior to that but definitely wasn't what I was expecting when I made it.  Will be trying again to see if it was something I did or the recipe needs tweaking.

I was happy with the taste ( I used strawberry gelatin and fresh strawberry slices)--reminded me a little of strawberry Starburst candy. Where I was disappointed was in the texture, which leaned more towards gelatin. I was looking for a fluffier, so next time I'll try adjusting with more whipped topping and use an electric mixer instead of a hand whisk.

It didn't set up and ended up more of a jello soup.
