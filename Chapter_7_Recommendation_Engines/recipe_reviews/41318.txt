I tried this recipe for a change from roasted chicken breast.  Instead of microwaving, I baked for 40-45 minutes, then put the toppings on and baked til golden.  Super easy.  It came out of the oven beautiful ... and delicious !! Everyone loved it.

This was a quick and delicious recipe but I don't like to cook with a microwave, so I changed a few things:  I used my own home-made tomato sauce, cooked with seasonings.  Then, place the crumb-coated chicken in a lightly greased 9X13 dish.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes.  Then put the sauce and plenty of mozzarella cheese on top, and bake for another 10 minutes.  It was great.

This tasted great! Very quick and easy. I used store-bought tomato sauce to save extra time on this one.

I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes since I was out, and it was just as good.   Also cooked it in the oven at 375 instead of microwave.

This recipe was quick, easy, and great!!!  Everyone really liked it.  I did bump up the ingredients in the crumb mixture for a little extra because the breasts that I used were very large and I baked it in the oven at 375 degrees for around 35-45 minutes.  No changes other than that and everyone loved it.  It is a definite cook again!!!

I'm not much of a microwave cooker but I had the ingredients and thought I'd try it!  My husband loved it and so did my kids (even my picky daughter).  I will definately do this one again!

Like another reviewer,I didn't have cornflakes so I used breadcrumbs.  I baked half of the breasts in the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes and the other half in the microwave as suggested in the recipe (my boyfriend was starving and couldn't wait).  Of course, the oven version was a lot better.  I give the microwave version 3 stars and the oven version 4 stars.  The microwave chicken is a little rubbery.  Anyway, I'll make this again because it's easy and that's important after a long day at work.

This was pretty good considering how easy and quick it was to make.  Cooking it in the microwave may have made it a little dry, but the cooking speed certainly made up for that.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this, even my fussy kids. The tomato sauce didn't appeal to me; it was a bit thin. Next time maybe I'll try spaghetti sauce instead. I baked mine in the oven too, as suggested by others. A keeper, will make again.

This was delicious!  I also baked the chicken breasts for 40 minutes at 350; then added the sauce and cheese topping and baked for an additional ten.  Because I didn't have mozzarella cheese, I had to use "taco cheese"--a combination of Colby, monterey Jack, etc.  It added an interesting zing.  My husband, who is not one to be enthusiastic about things, said I should "definitely" put this on our family menu.

This recipe was O.K. I tried to make this in the microwave but I found that it would have turned out better in the oven.  The coating was tasty but it really missed that baked in the oven flavor.  I found that the chicken dried out in the microwave.  I will try this again however.

My husband was shocked to learn that the entree he was bragging on was prepared in a microwave.  It was fast, easy and really good, it's a repeater for us!

This is not Chicken Cacciatore.  Chicken Cacciatore, or Hunter's Chicken, is traditionally made with diced tomatoes, peppers, onion, mushrooms, and garlic - using sauteed chicken.  This recipe is more like a version of Chicken Parmesan.  My favorite Chicken Cacciatore recipe on this website is Mom's Chicken Cacciatore.

LOVED this recipe!  It was so easy and my kids adored it as well.  They ate it outside on our picnic table and gave nibbles to their neighborhood friends who raved about it to their parents.  My husband liked it also. Yum Yum!
