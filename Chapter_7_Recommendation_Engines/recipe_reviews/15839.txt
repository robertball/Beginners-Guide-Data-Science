This recipe turned out pretty well overall.  I cooked the fish in a regular non-stick pan, cut out most of the butter (I used the olive oil instead), and added a splash of fresh lemon juice to the fish as it was cooking.  Because I'd read the reviews before making the recipe, I cooked the fish on medium (covered, five minutes on each side), and didn't have any problems with it burning or smoking.

This was really  great....a bit spicy but we love spicy.  I rubbed the seasoning on the fish and let it marinade in the refrigerator for an hour then I baked it in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes (lightly grease baking pan).  Served over broccoli/cheese rice with a side of spinach.  YUMMY!

Tastes great, but a word to the wise: keep that stove on medium! Our skillet got a little too hot and we ended up with crispy cajun red snapper. The spices are great on it, just make sure the skillet doesn't get too hot!

I'm not much of a fish person but I really liked this. I followed the recipe exactly as directed and liked it, however I did take the advice of another reviewer and I chose to bake it at 350 for 20 minutes instead of using the stove. Turned out wonderfully. I will definitely have this again!

After preparing the spices/herbs I realized that I didn't have snapper on hand like I thought. We had cajun cod instead.  I highly recommend this recipe for any type of white fish.

Oh my, this was good.  The only thing I added were buttered parmesan breadcrumbs on top to make a crunchy coating.  The spiciness was fantastic with the fish.  I actually made this twice in one week.  Such an easy recipe because almost everyone has these ingredients in their pantry.

The best I have had. My husband and I do not eat much fish, but with this recipe we will be eating more red snapper. We both loved this recipe. I actually made up 8 times the spice recipe so I will have it on hand. Great taste.

We thought it would do slightly better with a little less herbs, and a little less ceyenne.

This is a tasy dish, the cajun flavors are very prominent. That's good if, like me, you're wary of fish in general. If your kids like spicy stuff they'll probably eat this without a problem! The only drawback is that collecting and measuring all the spices is a bit time consuming. But all in all, a good dish! Yummy with couscous and a salad.

My husband used this recipe when I found fresh snapper at a fish market.  He followed the directions exactly and found that all we tasted was pepper.  I give it two stars only because our dislike may have more to do with personal taste. It was totally unedible to us.

This was good. I needed something quick and it was. Two things I recommended, use a non-stick skillet and double/maybe even triple the recipe to get a nice even coats on the snapper.

FANTASTIC! My first attempt at red snapper and we loved it.  I omitted the butter completely, and rubbed the filets with olive oil.  I then cooked them in a small amount of olive oil. I also sprinkled with some cracked red pepper for a little more heat.  Yum - thanks for the great recipe!!!

This is very tasty.  I soaked mine in a half/half mixture of lemon and lime juice to allow the fish to cure.  The citrus of the lemons and limes is a great complement to the spices.

This was an amazing dish.  We bought Red Snapper without knowing what to do with it.  This cooked the snapper perfect and had a truly amazing seasoning.  I can't wait to find out what else I can put this seasoning on.  Be warned, there is a cook kick from the cayenne pepper.  If you don't like spicy, consider cutting back on it, but then it's not as cajun.

This seasoning was very good and had just the right amount of spicy. I made the mistake of dredging my fish rather than just sprinking the fish with the herb mix. Still turned out yummy!

My husband works at a fish market so I am always looking for new ways to cook fish.  I found this to be tasty! I just adore white fish of just about any kind and I adore spice/spicy, so fabulous combo in my book! Thanks for the recipe!

This was really quick and tasty.  My only quibble was I didn't have quite enough rub to coat my chicken well.  I'll be more generous with the spice blend next time.

Great flavor in the seasoning, just enough heat in the taste but not overpowering..  The combination of butter and olive oil prevented the fish from sticking in the iron skillet.. I used grouper.

I fixed this for friends of ours one evening and they absolutely loved it.  It smoked the heck out of my kitchen, but other than that it was great.  I didn't change a thing.  I will definately fix again.

This was not the best Cajun Red Snapper I have ever had.  My husband liked it, however it gave me heartburn in the worst way.  I was up all night.  The flavor was great.  But to many herbs mixed with the spices.

I used cod since that is what I had.  I am a sissy, so I added less cayenne and black pepper than what the recipe called for.  I didn't measure the ingredients, I just eye-balled the amounts.  I melted the butter with the olive oil in the microwave.  Seasoned with salt and lemon juice at the table and my husband and I thought it was great.

I liked this but for a much simpler version I used cajun spice off the supermarket shelf and if you can't get red snapper, red talapia works just as well.

Very good.  The spices were a good mix of flavors.  I didn't think they overpowered the fish at all.  Hubby really liked.  Will make again, thanks!

Pretty good recipe, I didn't have a couple of the spices but I added white pepper (which is often used in Cajun recipes).  I also cut down on the butter and used canola oil. Great recipe.

This was delicious! I omitted the cayenne pepper because I didn't have any, but it was still full of flavor. Next time I may add some fresh lemon juice. I baked it at 400 degrees instead of pan-frying.

good, but next time I would go easy on the amount I put on the fish---it overwhelmed the fish flavor. I think some of the herbs could be decreased too. Will definitely try it again!

Hmm...this recipe was ok.  The seasoning was very good, HOWEVER red snapper is a pretty mild fish and the spices completely overpowered the fish.  I couldn't taste the fish at all actually, which was a real shame because it was incredibly fresh and would have been delightful with a little lemon, garlic and soy.  If you're going to make this, use a fish that can hold up to the strong seasoning.

I don't want to say that this wasn't good, but wow, was it every peppery (as other reviews commented).  Hubby and I both really enjoy spicy food, him way more than me, but this one was just plain 'hot'...not sure if this is traditional 'cajun' flavouring or not, but it is very peppery.  Would not make again for that reason, but thanks for sharing.

Good recipe.  You can just melt the butter in the microwave rather than having to do it on a skillet.  This is pretty spicy, so use the spices sparingly if you want it milder.

yummy. will make again. Good recipe that doesn't drown your fish with a lot of stuff. My husband and 8yr old both liked - who are somewhat hesitant to fish. The only issues were that butter mix didn't really 'drizzle' on very well. And i seemed to lack some spice mix for coating the fish. I did need some drops of lemon on mine (i love lemon-fish taste), my hubby did not.

This is the best recipe for fish I have ever made!  I didn't bother mixing up the cajun seasoning as I have a purchased one that I like already.  I also used walleye instead of red snapper - I think it would be great with any of that type of fish.   I do not own a cast iron pan and it still turned out great.  It's the only time my husband has eaten fish without tartar sauce!!

Excellent rub/seasoning. The high heat did cause a lot of smoke so next time I'm taking the cast iron skillet out to the grill! There WILL BE a next time. It was delicious.  I didn't use all that butter -half would probably work. Saved some of the rub for next time, there was plenty.

We used the exact amount of spice and it was yummy. We like it spicy though.

Although good and followed recipe, it had much to much pepper. Would try again . Simple weeknight fast meal.

I used this with a couple of 3/4" redfish filets, adjusted the cooking time, broiled for 7 min @500 degrees, baked for 15 min @400 degrees, then (because I like it "blackened") broiled another 5 min @500. Totally moist, flaky, flavorful, and pretty spicy. Next time I will increase the cayenne just a hair, the rest of the flavors were spot-ON! Thank you!

I didn't have dried garlic, used fresh. Wasn't quite done in the middle when done searing, put in the toaster oven for a few minutes. Super tasty and will make again!

I'm looking to lower my fat intake, so I used a brushing of olive oil before the spices and a very minimal brushing of melted butter after adding the spices and  before frying in a pan just brushed with olive oil.  The result: absolutely delicious.  Marbelet nailed the spices on this one.  Never had better.  My daughter thought it was "way too hot" for her but toughed it out and kept asking for more.

I had NEVER cooked red snapper before, but my husband always orders it in restaurants so I decided to give it a try at home. I followed the recipe (almost) exactly: I used less of everything since I was only serving 2 instead of 6, and I also followed the advice of previous raters and lowered the cooking temp to medium. IT. WAS. PHENOMENAL. Moist. Succulent. Spicy. I could have easily paid $15-20 for this dish at a restaurant and not felt cheated at all.

This is excellent.  I prefer to cook fish on the grill, but otherwise, I did everything exactly as the recipe says.  The spice mix makes lots.  I saved the extra in a spice container.  Now it's ready to go any time I want to make this dish.  I've tried it both with snapper and amberjack and both are wonderful.  The key is being quite generous with the seasoning.

Very good, though it didn't have all the flavor I was expecting.  I cooked the fish with onions, garlic and cauliflower and served over pasta.  My family really liked it, but I would probably up the spices if I served it this way again.

This was quick and easy and good, a nice change for your fish.  I had snapper from a deep sea fishing trip but I think it would work on any light fish to spice it up.

This is a great recipe!  It was fast and easy to put together because all the spices are those you keep on hand.    The fish was spicy and delicious, and I even omitted the salt completely. The fish was so flavorful, we didn't even notice!  We are trying to eat less sodium, so that is a huge plus!

This was good, but I guess I am just not used to cajun seasoning. It seemed like the spices overpowered the fish so much that I couldn't really taste the fish.

This was really good but it was too spicy for me (perfect for my hubby). I added bread crumbs to the seasoning mix. I'm going to try this again but with a different fish.

This is a great recipe! I had a premade Cajun seasoning with the spices the recipe lists, so I used that on the snapper. I do not have a cast iron skillet, so I baked them on a broiler pan in the oven with plenty of butter and some lemon juice. I baked the fish at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. I will definitely make this again and again!

Yum!!! Excellent! I hate fish and this makes fish great! All the spices are so healthy and get rid of the fishy disaster I usually put on the dinner table. I'm not a good fish cooker, but this recipe made me seem professional. My husbands smiles now when he sees Red Snapper on the dinner table.

One of our favorite fish, and a great recipe for the spicy cajun lover.  I substituted grape seed oil for the butter as it has a much hotter splatter point so foods tend not to scortch on the outside while not cooking in the middle, (a lot more healthy than butter or even olive oil too).

The combination of these spices is great!  Based on other reviews, I used a little less black pepper and cayenne.  I didn't have any red spapper, so I used tilapia instead...can't wait to try it with red snapper!

HOLY SMOKE!  I cooked this in a stainless steel pan, and it smoked the house up pretty good.  Wouldn't recommend if you can't ventilate.  Otherwise, I cooked it as written, and it was a wonderful blackened fish.  I always have all these ingredients on hand, and will be making this again and again.  Thanks!

This is a very tasty and easily prepared fish.  I used two 6 ounce fillets but 1/2 the recipe and ended up using a little extra oil and butter before turning the snapper.  The spices are very easy to prepare in advance; in fact, this recipe would be wonderful on a camping trip.  Excellent color and presentation.  Thanks!

Turned out great! My husband (not a fish lover) really liked it.  I used less cayenne and pepper and added a tbsp. of flour.  I would mix a larger portion than suggested because I nearly ran out of the mix and I had a smaller quantity of fish than the recipe called for.

It was pretty good, but next time I might omit some [or all] of the black pepper, 'cause it was just too peppery.  I could not taste most of the other spices [& I love spicy good!] because of the overarching pepper taste.  Other than that, it was pretty good!

Too hot for the wife, but I like it.  Didn't use a cast iron skillet so cook time was half suggested.

We cooked this in foil packets on the grill.  It was great, but really spicy!

Very good and full of flavor.  I had to add a little more olive oil -- overall it was great!

fairly bland, but maybe that's just the type of fish? It was good, but not delicious. My boyfriend who doesn't care for fish was able to eat it.
