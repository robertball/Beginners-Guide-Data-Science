YUM! I made my own thousand island dressing from scratch and instead of prepared coleslaw I used a cup of drained sauerkraut. Both my husband and I really liked these. Very good--great way to use up tortillas in the fridge and a new favorite "wrap" for lunch!

While there's nothing quite like a "Real Rebuen" this definitely makes for a quick and easy alternative.  Plus it's a lot less messy held together in a wrap! Instead of prepared coleslaw I used a bag of coleslaw mix which provided a nice crunch and didn't get things "soggy".  It mixed well with "Russian Style Creamy Salad Dressing" from this site. I also used sliced corned beef and sliced Swiss cheese vs. shredded. Very good!

I used green tortillas and served at my St. Patty's Day Party. I made a few significant changes to make them more Irish and they were gone by the end of the night. I use 8 oz of cream cheese blended with oregano salt and pepper. Sprinkled with 8 oz cheddar cheese and about 1/4 c. horseradish. I omitted the saurkraut and Russian Dressing.

My husband LOVES these! I premade them and put them in the freezer so he could grab them on the go for lunch. So easy and inexpensive!

I made this recipe as written but my family didn't really care for it. They didn't like the coleslaw or the russian dressing. Maybe if it was made with sauerkraut and thousand island?

Didn't like this recipe at all. Something about the cole slaw and the dressing didn't mix. Will be deleting this recipe.

I didn't think this tasted like a real Reuben but didn't expectit to. I only made one wrap using a low-carb green onion tortilla. I used Thousand Island dressing instead of Russian and cut it back to about two teaspoons. I used much less slaw as well...there was no way all that was going to fit in one wrap! I thought it was tasty and will make a great lunch wrap.

Served these on a snack tray New Year's Eve and they were just okay. I did omit the coleslaw and don't feel like adding it would have upped my rating. Used sliced beef and cheese from the deli rolled the tortillas and sliced into bite-size servings.

I made just one of these for lunch. I left out the coleslaw because I didn't have any. I had to use roast beef inplace of the corned beef ( I got the wrong thing at the store) and I used deli sliced swiss cheese.

This was delicious. It does not taste exactly like a regular reuben but I didn't expect it to based on the description. I'm a lot more likely to have coleslaw on hand than sauerkraut so I think this makes great use of leftovers. Thanks for sharing!
