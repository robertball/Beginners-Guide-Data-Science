I have been making these for a long time. People are always impressed.  However, I too use the milk chocolate chips.  I also add 2-3Tbs. of confection sugar to the peanut butter.  It makes the PB filling taste more like the store version and less like a clump of peanut butter.

I've made a variation of this for years. I add a little peanut butter to the chocolate--more like Hershey's. Also, I use powdered sugar, graham cracker crumbs, and peanut butter for the filling.  More like the real thing and not as rich.  if you eat a Reese Cup, you'll notice there's 'some grit' to it--the graham cracker crumbs are perfect for this.

I found this recipe to be good but it is easier if you pipe the chocolate and peanut butter into the muffin cups (paper lined is easiest) with either a pastry bag, or my favorite, plastic bags.  I let each layer harden in frige before adding the next. I preferred the flavor of milk chocolate to the semi-sweet, having tried both.  Also, don't add too much peanut butter or it is like eating a huge tablespoon of peanut butter.  I make buckeye balls every year and actually prefer the filling of those but the ease of these.  I think I will be combining the two methods instead! Maybe just a softer, creamier version of the buckeye filling! Great idea though!  Never even thought of it after 15 years of rolling and dipping buckeye balls!!!

I think "Acurlytop" has this recipe down and I followed her/his advice by adding the confectioners sugar and the graham crackers. My daughter has a peanut allergy, so I used her soy nut butter. Because it's Easter, I made the filling into egg shapes and simply dipped them into the chocolate. So much easier than having to make the cups. I had my older daughter test taste them and she said they were delicious and tasted very much like Reeses. Thank you so much Pam for a great start to a wonderful treat that I know Ty will be so appreciative of tomorrow morning!

These were delicious. I added some powdered sugar and graham cracker crumbs to the peanut butter to make it a little more like Reese's. They were excellent (if a little messy to make) and very addictive.

I made these as a treat at a pot luck sort of thing and they were a big hit. I also used milk chocolate instead of semi sweet. I mixed three tablespoons of confectioners sugar into the peanut butter as well. They turned out great, but I would recomend leaving them in the fridge for about an hour instead of a half hour, or even putting them in the freezer. Mine turned out a little soft and sticky, but were still great-tasting. Thanks Pam!

These are so Delicious! The only thing I did different was to chill each layer prior to adding the next. I also used non-stick mini paper toffee pans. I couldn't believe how easy these were to make (and cheap) as trying to by them is Australia, they are rare and costly. Well done!

This recipe was by far the easiest and quickest I've found.  I loved these, but prefer to use milk choc chips to give a sweeter taste.

These were so pretty and we ate them all!  But there was not enough peanut butter and I would do it different next time by using chunky peanut butter  and letting the first layer cool before adding peanut butter and so on.  Fun to make.

They were really easy to make, but there wasn't enough chocolate, so I made about 50% more. They tasted absolutley delicious, and they really were gone in minutes!

This was a good, quick, easy recipe to follow. I will say one thing, I advise that you use a teaspoon for the chocolate. I ran out. I also ran out of peanut butter. If you're a peanut butter lover like me, you'll have to heat more.  Also, when I ran out of chocolate and was microwaving more, I forgot the butter and vegetable oil. It wound up becoming like those Betty Crocker microwaveable cakes. I recommend using the double boil system with a heat resistant bowl over a pot of hot water. I'm adding a customized version of this if anyone is interested.

Awesome!! :) I used the 'Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting' recipe as the middle filling, just made it more creamy than it calls for by adding extra milk! DELICIOUS! Also I suggest using REAL peanut butter if you want it to taste more like the Reeses! The real peanut butter has the grittyness to it without needing to add the graham cracker crumbs! :) :) Thanks for the recipe!! :)

I substituted SoyNut butter for the peanut butter due to my son's nut allergy.  Verrrry easy to make!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  Now, my boys can have a safe alternative to Reeses.  :)  They loved them!!!

I used Hershey's milk chocolate chips and with the butter and oil, the chocolate seemed very greasy and oily and did not taste good. Next time I will cut down on the butter and oil.  Do as the other reviewer suggested and chill each layer before you add the next.  It will be much easier and turn out better.

This recipe sounded good at first, but came out really bad. I think you meant to say to use milk chocolate chips, because the semisweet didn't come out very good.

SOO EASY!  My 4 year old and I can whip these up in a jiffy.  They are so tasty and will disappear fast.  They do melt in your hands while you eat them.  I might lower the amount of butter to see if that will help.

These are good, but for the cost of ingredients and amount of effort I think we will just buy them premade...just my family's opinion.

Very yummy and easy. I mixed confectioner's sugar and butter with the peanut butter to make it more creamy and easy to pour. Skip the oil altogether. And instead of chocolate chips, I used candy coating from the store, the ones you use to make chocolate candy. Perfect.

This was good idea. They were really easy to make. I used 1/2 cup semisweet and 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips. And 1/2 cup peanut  butter 1/4 cup powder sugar. I didn't use any oil or butter and they were great. I also used plastic bags to pipe the chocolate and peanut butter into the cups. I filled the mini papers full, so they were nice and big candies. Next time I won't worry about getting the chocolate up the sides with a spoon because piping the peanut butter with a bag creates a nice way to make the peanut butter blob in the very center and leaves room for the chocolate to fill in around all the sides.

I loved these!  Did use 1/2 milk chocolate chips and 1/2 semi-sweet chips.  Only problem is waiting for them to 'set up' before savoring them!

I used a mixture of semi sweet and milk chocolate.  It was perfect for us.  Thank you for a post that was easy and exactly what we wanted.

These did not turn out like I expected at all. The semi-sweet chocolate chips are not right for this, and the peanut butter needs something--maybe powdered sugar, like in buckeyes? This is a good, quick idea, but it didn't work out for us at all.

These were soooo good! I've made them quite a few times already, and I can't stop eating them all up before I even give them out! I made the chocolate on the stove, and the peanut butter in the microwave, and added a tbsp. of butter to the peanut butter. They're very sweet, and even better than Hershey's! Just make sure to let them fully refridgerate. They're a little hard to remove from the muffin tins, I used a knife and cut around the sides.

These were just so-so.  The semi-sweet chocolate didn't taste right.  If this was supposed to be a clone recipe, it missed the mark.  Next time I will use milk chocolate.

Nice.  I used fresh ground almond butter and it made the filling very much like a reeses texture.  I agree on the no vegetable oil and cooling between layers.  quite yummy, quick and simple....=dangerous

These were very good and simple to make. I didn't bother with the oil and added a bit of brown sugar to the melted peanut butter.

These are so so yummy. After reading reviews I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semi sweet.
So glad I doubled this..we cant keep our hands off them!

I loved this recipe!!  I will definitely use again but next time I'll make more of the peanut butter filling and chocolate.  Definitely need to triple the recipe!!  I loved the semi sweet chocolate with this it was a big hit with my husband who doesn't like chocolate that much!

These are great for a quick chocolate fix.  I do see why people might use milk chocolate, but I happen to be a fan of the semisweet chips.  I used paper liners in my pan, plopped in the chocolate/peanut butter/chocolate, and threw them in the freezer for a half hour, it worked great.

This recipe is great when your in the mood for a quick sweet snack & it is very easy to make! I to used milk chocolate and added a little confectioner's sugar to the peanut butter to cut down on the peanut butter flavor & add sweetness. My whole family loves them! Thank you Pam!!!!!

No changes, will make again with changes. I used paper liners in my mini pans and found the tablespoon of chocolate was too much. The peanut butter spilled out when the other layer went on. They  looked nothing like the photo. There taste was delicious.

Yup I made changes, I made changes to adjust to my family's tastes.  Most people already know if they like semi sweet , dark or milk chocolate. so ok, make changes, but if you make changes ( butterscotch or white chocolate in particular), and then the recipes doesnt work, not the recipes fault. If they do work, thats great! all that said, my changes are Milk chocolate, and confectioners sugar in the peanut butter.  dont forget a a little cooking spray in the mini muffin cups,   this is a great easy base recipe

I have been making these for years. At Christmas I make fudge, lots of fudge and chocolates. These are the favourites. I, like many, use milk chocolate and I was surprised to see that the peanut butter is melted. I have always used a creamy peanut butter and just spooned some in over the bottom chocolate and it settles in nicely. I was intrigued to see in some of the comments that graham wafer crumbs and confectioners sugar are added to the peanut butter and I think I will give that a try this year. Also, I have never used the oil or butter and I don't think I will. All in all, it is a great recipe and they will disappear very quickly.

Used milk chocolate like others suggested and they were so tasty. I found the chocolate chewy, but I think that was my fault for over-cooking.
