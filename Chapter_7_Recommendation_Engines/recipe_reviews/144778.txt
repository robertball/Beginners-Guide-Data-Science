Oh My Gosh!  This was so good!  I did not want to buy the choc vodka so I substituted Godiva liquor and Vodka.  Will make these again as the Christmas Eve crowd loved them!!

Because I did not have chocolate OR cherry vodka, I used a little more (homemade sugar free) chocolate syrup and grenadine. I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka. This is VERY sweet but one of the best martini drinks I've ever made. Quite decadent.

Best martini I've ever had.  Made it exactly as written except for the maraschino cherry and chocolate kiss.  Definitely a keeper.

This was good.  Not sure it tasted like a chocolate covered cherry though.  I made both ways.  As recipe stated and then substituting the chocolate vodka with Godiva white chocolate liqueur.  The vodka made it more like a martini and the liqueur made it more like a mixed cream drink.  Both were good.

Just tried it very good! Used a frozen martini glass and rolled the rim with magic shell chocolate. Shook ingredients until ice cold poured in glass then drizzled a little more magic shell chocolate as I whipped it with a stir stick! Was very good !!!

Dipping the rim in chocolate was the best I could do, as I could not get the pick through a Hershey’s Kiss to save my life!  Never-the-less, this is an awesome dessert drink and tastes just like a chocolate covered cherry.  Let me clarify, a brandy soaked chocolate covered cherry.  lol!  It’s a little strong, but tolerable when slowly sipped.

Delicious and decadent. Used Godiva in place of the vodka, maraschino juice in lieu of grenadine, and lined the glass with the syrup instead of mixing it in. It tastes so much like a chocolate covered cherry that I'm deliciously happy. Thank you for a wonderful concoction.

Loved it! I could not find chocolate vodka, so I used Godiva chocolate  liqueur. Absolutely delicious! Definite on to keep on hand. I added a photo, but I had already drank some (couldn’t wait haha)!

Awesome! I didn't have the cherry or the chocolate kiss, but this was still delicious. I'm feeling a little tipsy. Thank you PunkyB.
