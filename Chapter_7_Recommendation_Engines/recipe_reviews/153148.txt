My 19 yo DD is eating this for breakfast!  We love spinach dip and I wanted to try this with the jicama. I went to the store and found 1! very small jicama, I snagged it and put it in the FP. Perfect texture, I wasn't sure if the jicama would get soggy as it sat, Nope, Still plenty of Crunch! I also added a handful of chopped cilantro to add a bit of pizazz and it was Perfect! We have a new version of an old favorite at my house thanks to Turbo01 and this gem!  BTW, I usually put this dip in a bread bowl. I hollow out the bread bowl and slather the inside cavity with EVOO and bake it till it gets all crispy and golden, Then put the dip in it. That way, the bowl holds up and has even More flavor! The bread from inside can be toasted at the same time and used at a dipper.

This was very good!  I liked the idea of using jicama instead of waterchestnuts, and the addition of the red bellpepper.  It had great flavor & crunch.  The only thing I changed was to add a second package of chopped spinach.  With only 1 pkg it is VERY light on the spinach and in my opinion 2 was just right :)  I will definitely make this again!

Yummy! it was exactly what I was looking for.  I did do some alterations from the original recipe though.  I used a medium to large jicama, 3 teaspoons of fresh cracked pepper, 4 stalks of green onions, and 2 packages of frozen spinach.

I couldn't find the leek mix, so I used only veggie.  I increased spinach to about an extra half-pkg.  Two whole packages would have been realllly spinachy.  This recipe offered a deeper flavor than other spinach dips I've tried, and the jicama has a more pleasing texture than water chestnuts, which can feel like styrofoam, in my opinion!  This is a keeper.  Served with pita chips, but we've been spreading the leftovers (recipe makes a ton) on slices of bread.

Very tasty! Instead of leek soup mix we used french onion soup mix. We left out the vegetable soup mix. Everything else was kept the same.

Seriously LOVED IT! so did the kids. I couldn't find Leek dry soup mix so i used 2 Knorr veggie soup mix. I also used the suggestion of another rate that recommended putting the bread in the oven with a little olive oil. Made the bread nice a crispy to tear off and enjoy. Also i didn't have bread available so i used a 1/2 cup of crushed up saltine crackers and soaked them in the cream. NOTE: crush them well.
The Jicama is so much better than the water chestnuts!!!
