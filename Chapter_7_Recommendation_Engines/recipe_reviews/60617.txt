We absolutely loved the flavors in these wings!!  The only things I changed about this recipe were additions:  we like a little heat, so I added some Vietnamese chili sauce, and a little sesame oil.  Marinated them for about 8 hours, and they were great.  Update:  I have now made these a dozen times, and each time they receive RAVE reviews from my guests.  They are also excellent grilled.

Wow. Is this GOOD! And so flavorful.

I had some chicken legs to use up so I used those instead of chicken wings. I didn't marinate it overnight like the recipe called for. I broiled the legs for about 20 minutes on each side, then tossed them in the sauce. Cooked up nice and crisp. I didn't change much to the sauce, other than cutting back on the chili sauce, which I only used a tablespoon of. I also doubled the recipe.
This turned out great. I used the drippings from the chicken in The Day Before Payday Fried Rice. Great meal!

It started out kind of bland so I added more of the sweet chili sauce and it turned out great!! I also used Chicken breasts instead of the wings, and grilled it on the George Forman. My family loved it!!

The Flavor was Sensational.  I placed Chicken Legs in a Large Resealable Bag and added the marinade and let soak overnight.  Wow - Excellent Flavor.  This would be great on the BBQ too I'm Sure.  I will make this again.

Wow! My husband and I were looking for some different wing recipes that were baked and these were fantastic! For an Asian recipe, it is really low in sugar, too. My husband suggested using some red pepper flakes next time to spice it up a bit. Overall, amazing recipe.

Delicious! I used quarter legs and grilled them. Had to sub sweet and sour with some chili flakes for the sweet chili sauce. Worked great. Served with onion rice and steamed broccoli and radishes

I doubled the marinade for 8 bone in breasts. I subbed lime juice for the fish sauce because of allergies. Very good taste, loved by everyone. Grilled the breasts and the smelled fantastic!

This recipe was yummy, but I did add cilantro to it to give it that tang since I love cilantro so much. I marinated for the chicken wings for about three hours and it was great. Afterwards, I added a little oil to the pan and baked for about 45 mins, but I also saved the sause and brush it as if I was BBQing it and it gave much more flavor; therefore, it wasn'try. My family ate the whole thing. Literally! I will definitly use this recipe again and it would be great for BBQ!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe! YumOOO!!

These were good, but not our favorite.  The cooking time is for whole wings - if you are doing wingettes/drumettes, it takes less time.  I set our timer for less, but they still got a little crispy.

These were delicious. Cooked perfectly. The only mistake I made was to get whole wings. Would be better with the drumettes. Am keeping this recipe for sure.

Very good - just make sure to give it enough time to marinate so the full flavors of the 5-spice can soak in.

These wings were pretty good. The only thing I did differently was I added cilantro. I thought the next time I make these I may add some orange marmalade instead of the sugar. I may have to go and get some more wings sooner than I thought!

Great flavor combination. Doubling the amount of fish sauce would effectively cut down marinating time to only a few hours.

I used chicken tenders as well as drumettes. Both turned out very moist. I only did 30 min @ 425, not the 45 min.
Upon reading the recipe, it did not look like enough quantity to cover all the chicken I had, however, once you make it - it is more than enough.
I gave it three stars because overall I just didn't like it.  It wasn't bad, it had potential. I did not use the fish sauce (couldn't find it in the store - not something I would ever use). Although I have never used them before, for me the combo of the sweet chili sauce and the Chinese five-spice was overwhelming. I am willing to try them again separately .

This one carries a whopping 5 stars on my recipe list!  It's an awesome recipe that also is great by subbing in Sriracha Chile sauce for the Sweet Chile sauce for more spice.

The chinese five spice is not something I was very familiar with, but it was tasty. I used chicken breasts and we grilled them. The fish sauce was a little too prominent for us so next time I'll cut it back a touch. The recipe is a nice change of pace with asian flavors.

Since this was the first time I followed the recipe pretty close.  Soaked the Drummies in salted ice water for half an hour before marinating them in a zip lock bag for 8 hours.  Really enjoyed the flavor but will tweek it a bit next time to make them a bit spicier.  The only thing was, I couldn't get them crispy. Tried dropping a couple in a fryer after they were cooked and that seemed to help a bit.  Using the Drummies it only took about a half hour to get them up to temperature inside.

I made this to specs, except for the following. I marinated for 24 hours in a sealed bag refrigerated. I placed the wings and drumettes on a raised rack in a cookie sheet lined in foil and sprayed with oil. This solved the "un-crispness" issued in other views. Cooked at 425 for 50 minutes without turning. Then broiled for 5 more minutes. Nice and crispy but NOT dry. I served these up over julienned cabbage to keep them crispy and appealing. Will make these again soon.

Yum, yum.  I doubled the marinade recipe with more finely chopped garlic (used a whole bud), 1/2 regular onion (no green onion available), and lime juice up front, then let the marinade work on the drums, wings and drumettes overnight and during the next day.  I cooked for 60+ total minutes, turning at 20 and 40 minutes, then pouring off all liquid so they "dried" in the last 20. Made a veggie stir fry in coconut oil and added a little plum sauce at the end.  DELISH FLAVOURS!  Highly recommended.

I guess I'm not really a huge fan of Chinese 5 spice, mostly because it tastes so much like licorice (it has star anise, fennel, and licorice root in it). However, we didnt have time to marinate these and we made some BBQ wings at the same time, and these came out much more tender and flavorful than the BBQ ones, and the seasonings penetrated into the chicken for some really tasty wings. 
We didnt have sweet chili sauce so I substituted a tablespoon of hoisin and a tablespoon of crisp chili oil. I doubt it made much of a difference, honestly.

In the words of my critic (my 6th grader), "It's hecka good!" and I agree with her. Followed the recipe as is. I did modify the cooking time. I poked the chicken after the recommended 45 minutes and blood was still oozing. So I diluted the remaining marinade with water placed it in the pan, covered with foil and cooked for another 15 minutes. It turned out fully cooked yet juicy inside. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were wonderful! Can't wait to make for next gathering.  I followed recipe to the letter and marinated the wings overnight.  These were really good; not sure they had to be in a 425 for 45 minutes tho.   I tossed thin sliced cabbage with a little sesame oil, rice vinegar and chopped peanuts and that was the "bed" for our plates for dinner!  Great flavor!

Excellent flavor.  I doubled the sauce and used with chicken drumsticks.  I'm not a huge fan of 5 spice seasoning but my hubby gave this a 9 on 10.  Thanks for sharing!
