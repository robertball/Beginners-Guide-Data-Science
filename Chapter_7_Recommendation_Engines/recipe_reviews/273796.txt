These are delicious!  I would recommend using very large shrimp and small jalape√±os as I had shrimp left over and I only started with a pound.  I think very large shrimp would have made this recipe perfect!

Great flavor combo! I only used a pound of shrimp and was able to fit two in each jalapeno half and still had shrimp leftover. The one thing I did not care for is that the shrimp get overcooked in the time it takes to brown the bacon. I recommend pre-cooking the bacon a bit first to eliminate the overcooking of the shrimp. Overall good recipe and one that would be a hit at your next cookout.
