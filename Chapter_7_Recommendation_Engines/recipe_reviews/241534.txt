This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I used all boneless chicken breasts and followed directions exactly.  The flavor was amazing and chicken was moist and tender.  I cooked on low for about 4 1/2 hours.  Served with corn tortillas, chopped red onion and cilantro.  Added some black beans and rice and dinner was great.  Looking forward to left overs tonight!

Only did 1 tsp of cumin. Beyond that followed to the letter and it was amazing!!!!!!! I ate mine over shredded cabbage for a super healthy and tasty Baja bowl. Squeezed some extra lime over the top and was in heaven :)

We didn't have actual cilantro, so we just used some dried cilantro (and used an entire jalapeño pepper) and it was glorious!! My family loved it and our friends thought it was he best chicken taco they have ever had. Definitely making again!

A little sweet because I omitted jalapeno but well rounded once the jalapeno and cilantro were added  to the adult portions.  For the kids, I made quesadillas and just added diced tomatoes and cheese and they loved them.

I followed it as closely as I do anything ... but did add a tablespoon or maybe two of maple syrup.  It smelled amazing while cooking and I expected it to be good, but it was even better than my expectations!  This will be my go-to for boneless skinless chicken thighs.

Bland. Followed recipe exactly. Did add more cumin and salt pepper at the end to try and give it more flavor. Just ok. However, I did use the leftovers in a casserole by adding sour cream, rotel and mexican rice. That was delicious

This is a really good recipe! My kids gave their approval as well-which says a lot from my picky daughter. I wasn't sure about the orange juice, but it added great flavor. Very tender and full of flavor!

Yummy, easy recipe! We all loved it. I followed the directions except used garlic powder instead of cloves. I will definitely use this recipe again! Great with avocado, cilantro, and onion.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family! I would have preferred it be a bit spicier maybe next time I will add another jalapeño or some sort of chilli powder. I needed a bit more liquid so I added more juice and I should have added water to cut down on the sweetness instead. All in all with a few tweaks this will be added to the line up of family dinners!

Made exactly as directed except my cooking time ended up being only 3 hours on LOW.   Very good flavor and aromas. Would be a good shredded chicken for enchiladas too.

Delicious! Very juicy tacos. I used all chicken thighs, as that is what I had on hand. I will note I fed myself and two guys and it was all gone. That was with more chicken than the recipe listed. Next time I'll make more, according to how many I'm feeding. And I'll probably add a dollop of sour cream next time, too!

Fairly easy, 2 out of 4 of us loved it.  I thought it was pretty good, but lacking flavor, like it was missing something.  Youngest didn’t like it at all.  I made it as written ... I will consider making it again, but maybe adding something like chili powder.

I think our favorite slow cooker chicken taco recipe-  used breasts and cooked on low 4-5 hours, high 2-3.  Delish!

Doubled and used thighs, took around 4-5 hours on high.  KIds love this as well

Followed directions exactly and the family loved it! (My husband insisted I make it twice in one week!) the second time I made it I added a little more jalapeño to give it some more heat. We served it on corn tortillas topped with cabbage and fresh salsa. Love a delicious and easy meal!

I doubled the recipe as it is and it was a total crowd pleaser. Personally I thought it was bland but I was definitely the only one. Everyone else at the party loved it and came back for seconds and sometimes thirds! Don't skip the jalapeño, it makes the dish!

I made this only instead of chicken I used pork shoulder. it was absolutely amazing. I served then with corn and flour tortillas. topping was shredded leafy green lettuce, chopped red onion, fresh cilantro, salt, pepper, and the juice of 1 lime. I mixed all the ingredients together and let the flavors melt together. everyone had seconds and thirds.

Delicious! I made the chicken and used the shredded meat for enchiladas. Since I'd made a double batch, there was enough for homemade chicken orzo soup. Everyone loved both meals and the soup had a tasty kick. A new easy favorite!

The flavors blended beautifully!  We only had frozen, pre-cooked, pre-chopped chicken, so we heated it in a slow cooker with all of the flavorings, .... with less water.  We used OJ concentrate without the added water, and that was plenty of fluid.  We also used 'tamed' jalapenos.  Yum!

The taste was amazing! I omitted jalapeno and cilantro because I did not have them, and we don't like spicy meals. However, I think cilantro would have completed the flavor! I also baked it in the oven and just covered it for the first half to keep the flavors and juices with the chicken. I will definitely make this again.

We liked it! I omitted the jalapeno for my toddler's sake and used chicken broth instead of OJ (it just sounded too sweet). The meat was tender and juicy. I also added a few more spices to my liking (paprika, cayenne, oregano) but I'm sure it  would have been great without them too.

This excellent. I do not like spicy foods but I like flavor and this chicken is moist & flavorful. I did NOT add any jalapeno. I doubled the recipe but did not double the OJ as per other reviews. I used all thighs and red onion. Do not skip the fresh cilantro, its cheap and keeps for a week in a glass of water on the countertop and adds fantastic flavor.

I made this with all the ingredients but it seemed so bland to me and my family. The chicken was tender but needed more heat. It smelled divine in the slow cooker but was a bit disappointed in the end. (And normally I am not on this app)

This recipe is amazing! I used chicken breast instead of thighs but everything else I followed exactly to the letter. I cooked on low for three hours in the crockpot and my chicken was tender and juicy. I topped with some homemade guacamole for a finish!! This recipe is a must!

I used this chicken recipe to make green enchiladas! I just added some of the juice in with the enchilada sauce and chopped the jalapeño up to add in with the chicken. It turned out amazing! Great recipe!

This was easy to make and was very good. I followed the recipe exactly except I used boneless skinless thighs. We all liked it, but we agreed it could use more flavor. I was surprised because as I was adding the cumin and and garlic, it seemed like it was going to be too much.  We all agreed I should make it again, but that I should increase the spices next time.  I will probably double the cumin, garlic, onion and jalapeños.  Might even add some cayenne.

The chicken smelled fantastic but I found it to be a little bland. I used plenty of cumin, salt and pepper too.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used all breast meat as that's what I had.  I think it would've been more flavorful with thighs.  This turned out very bland.  The citrus did not cut through the meat to flavor it.  It didn't even taste better the next day.  It'll do for sandwiches or tacos if you're adding salsa, sour cream, etc for additional flavor but I won't use this recipe again.

Loved this recipe!  So easy, moist, and tasty!  I didn't have a jalapeno, so I used crushed red pepper flakes.  And I also didn't have any cilantro (sadly), but it still had a good flavor.  I imagine it would have been even better if I'd had some.  I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe is delicious!  I didn't have OJ, so I used grapefruit juice (freshly squeezed).  I added a little more soy sauce, cumin & some garlic powder and served it with black beans & cilantro lime brown rice in chilled romaine lettuce wraps.  I added fresh tomatoes & squeezed a little more grapefruit juice on each wrap.  My boyfriend & I really enjoyed the healthy but filling option!

The first time I made this I thought it was very bland. I made the following adjustments the second time I made it and turned out more to our liking - added 1 T orange zest  to brighten it up and green salsa to taste. I also spread the chicken out on a sheet pan and broiled it just until it started to caramelize.  I did not use a jalapeno to the cooking fluid but saved it to go on the actual tacos so people to adjust the heat to their liking.

I was looking for a change for chicken tacos. The citrus in this recipe intrigued me. I followed the recipe and tasted it. As written it has a bright fresh flavor! People should keep in mind that not all Mexican food is spicy! I know my family would like a bit more heat so I added a small can of mild green chilies to add a little kick. This will go into my keepers. Thanks for a refreshing take on chicken tacos.

For the taco seasoning, I substituted homemade seasoning made with Alton Brown's recipe from the Food Network.  My husband and grandson both ate more than one serving (so did I)!

Very good... the entire family really liked it.  Browned the chicken before puttng in slow cooker. Mixed the other ingredients, used them to quickly deglaze the frying pan and poured over over chicken. Cooked on high for 3 hours.

This recipe was right on the money. Easy to make and great flavors. Great summer meal. Goes well with a Dos Equis Amber with a lime. Only thing I did not add was the jalapeño. I forgot to buy but I’m don’t like things too spicy so it was ok for me.

These seemed like they were missing something. There just wasn't any pop to the flavor. Otherwise, they were easy to make  and went well topped with red onions, lime juice, and tomatoes.

Good recipe for using chicken thighs which I cooked with bone and no skin. I didn't have orange juice but did use some orange extract. I shredded the double batch of chicken for some chili too. I served chicken with some guacamole that I made. I definitely will do this again.
