I used vanilla greek yogurt and threw in a tad more raisins. The boys LOVED this salad. They ate their portion and asked for the rest.

Some things can be made healthy with substitutions. In this case it didn't work out well. I love the original carrot raisin salad and I'll try this again doing it 1/2 and 1/2 with mayo/yogurt.

Healthy yet still creamy, and perfectly sweetened with the pineapple in its juice.  Simple to make-will be a staple salad for me and my family.

This was a healthy and refreshing dish that my daughters and I all loved!  I used plain greek yogurt and found it plenty sweet.  Next time I will strain the crushed pineapple so the mixture is creamier and less juicy.

I also used vanilla greek yogurt and added more raisins. I added some cinnamon to it and it tastes like a dessert!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I added more crushed pineapple and raisins. I wanted the raisins plump so before adding the raisins to the salad, I poured hot water over them and let them sit for 10 minutes.  I drained the water and added the raisins.  Yum.  Definitely making again.

This is a great recipe.  Very flavorful with only 4 simple ingredients.  Not a fan of the name, however.  "Wabbit" is cute when a two-year-old says it, but when adults use baby words it's just annoying!

Delicious!  I made it just as stated!  I used baby carrots and put them in my blender on chop!  I plumped the raisins in hot water as another reviewer recommended, so they were nice and soft and not hard and chewy!  And I only had pineapple chunks and also put them in the blender on chop for a few seconds!  Delicious blend of flavors and so very healthy!

Would have been better with vanilla yogurt instead of plain.

Great, easy recipe! This was good with plain yogurt; I thought about using vanilla yogurt, but with the juice from the pineapple and the raisins, it had enough sweetness.
