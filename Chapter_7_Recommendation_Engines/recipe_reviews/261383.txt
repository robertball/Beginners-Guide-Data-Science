This turned out really good. The ancho chile was a nice touch and the bouillon cube added a lot of flavor. I did make two minor changes (one in an ingredient and one in preparation). Hubby is not near as picky as he used to be so I do change things up some for his benefit. He is weird about tomatoes and stewed are a big no in his book. He only tolerates smaller ones with more texture so I used petite diced. He will eat a completely cooked bell pepper but I know that he prefers and actually enjoys them when they still have a nice crunch to them. I added them in the last 10 minutes of cook time and that was perfect. I did end up having to add another 1/2 water but other than that this worked as written.
