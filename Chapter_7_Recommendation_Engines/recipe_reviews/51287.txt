Wonderful, easy recipe. I omitted the chicken broth and oyster sauce because we're vegetarians, and added a little extra garlic and tons of soy sauce instead. I served them over mei fun noodles...yum. Just as good the next day, too!

*hint for the tofu* this is so much better if you can get the tofu as dry as possible.  Try pressing it between two plates. Put the tofu on one plate then put another plate on top of it w/something heavy like some books or a watermelon top of it, then just dump the extra water out.  I do it for an hour or so because I like the texture of the tofu to be dry! Great recipe!!! (not usually a tofu lover either!)

Fast, easy, and delicious.  I would recommend getting the firmest tofu you can and stir-frying it a few minutes before you add the garlic so it takes on a firmer, more "fried" texture and is not too squishy.  Also, I found that after I cooked the frozen veggies, I had quite a bit of liquid left over, so I added some cornstarch water and let it set a few minutes after I turned off the heat.  This made a delicious sauce when it thickened up a bit.  I also used a little more oyster sauce.

Fried the tofu first and set aside. I added fresh asparagus , onion and yellow bell pepper (no frozen veggies). I also added a teaspoon of black bean sauce instead of fish sauce , turend out great . Served over jasmine rice.

This recipe is great as is.  I also tried a variation.  I first sauteed one onion and a few fresh mushrooms, then added the tofu, garlic and oyster sauce.  I didn't set the mixture aside.  Instead, I continued cooking and added one bag of fresh organic spinach instead of the frozen vegetables.  I finished cooking with the chicken broth and oyster sauce.  This is great over brown rice.

My boyfriend and I devoured the whole thing last night, it was that good.  I added 10 cloves of garlic (I love garlic), but I still didn't find it that garlicy...I think the oyster sauce cancels out some of the garlic.  I added fresh bok choy, carrots, a bit of fresh grated ginger, and 1/2 onion.  Amazing!  I will be eating this one regularly.

Very good. Next time, fry the tofu in oil first, then proceed with the recipe. Otherwise the tofu is slimy and mushy.

Good flavour. Used fresh gai lan and red pepper instead of frozen veggies, which made the broth a bit watery, so corrected with corn starch.
Vegetarians can find sauce substitute (oyster-flavoured mushroom sauce) at asian groceries.

mmmm sooo yummy and easy! I didn't want to use frozen veggies, so I used whatever I had on hand (I already had 1/2 roasted cauliflower that I threw in), as well as one onion, 2 carrots, and a bell pepper.  It was good and would be good with whatever veggies you have on hand. I could see using mushrooms, snow peas, broccoli, or whatever you would like.  Cooked the tofu and set aside and then sauteed the veggies w/ the chicken broth and covered, letting them cook, then when they were almost done added the oyster sauce.

This was simply excellent.  Do not skip the oyster sauce.  You might as well not make it if you don't have oyster sauce!

Nice! My family loves garlic so this went over well. I used a tablespoon of arrowroot powder to thicken the sauce. Very good.

If you like tofu, this is a great dish to try because it has great flavor!  Try and use the firmest tofu that you can get,is my advice.  Also, I minced my garlic (all 6 cloves - wonderful!)

Even if you don't like tofu (I just learned that I don't, lol) this is a really good recipe to use as a stir-fry. I was nervous, but I made it mostly as written (added fresh carrots and mushrooms, subbed in vegetable broth and "oyster-flavored" sauce) and it impressed me greatly. Will make again.

Amazing, def use firm tofu and use paper towels to dry it out before you cook.  Oyster sauce only has 15 cals per tablesppon- healthiest meal ever!

Substituted fish sauce for oyster sauce, and cut garlic in half (big mistake, by the way!). Great way to use up frozen vegetables, and quick to whip up. I added a bit of sriracha chili sauce to give it some heat, but I still felt like it was missing something.

I followed the recipe exactly, using light tofu. It turned out pretty good, except next time I will try draining the tofu all day to make it less squishy. The oyster sauce really adds a nice flavor. Overall, this is a very healthy, tasty dish!

This is wonderful.  My 3 and 4 yr olds loved the "square eggs" as they called it.  And my 13 yr old tried tofu for the first time when I made this dish and he says he doesn't mind eating vegetarian meals like this! Great recipe, thanks for sharing it with us.

This was a great recipe.  The garlic flavour infused throughout the rest of the vegetables and tofu and I could make a low-carb meal by eating it alone without rice/pasta.

I'm surprised that more comments are not made about the 6 cloves of garlic.  If I make this again I will use half that much!  I love garlic, but that was all I could taste in this dish!  The only change I made was using fresh veggies instead of frozen.

This was my first attempt at cooking with tofu, and let me tell you....it was good! I was really surprised how tasty it came out considering I'm not a fan of tofu! My husband liked it (and he is strictly carnivorous!)and even my picky 1 1/2 yr old & 5 yr old liked it! Felt good seeing then easy healthy, and enjoying it!

Added some water chestnuts, bean sprouts, noodles and served this over brown rice with the tiniest bit of teriyaki sauce over top. My husband didn't even care that it was tofu! he loved it! Very healthy. =)

Very easy. Next time, I think I will add some onion with the tofu. I also want a kick of flavor so I might add chili or chili sauce.

I used a prewashed bag of baby carrots, broccoli and cauliflower florets and roasted w/ olive oil at 375 degrees for 30 min.  I used soy instead of oyster sauce.  This is one of the best things I've made in a while.

Great recipe! I pressed the tofu before stir-frying  I used fresh veggies and steamed them a little before adding them to the stir-fry, so I did not use any chicken broth to cook them. I served this with brown rice. I will definitely make it again.

I really don't like trashing recipes, but I followed the instruction and this was just plain bad. It may have been me, as I am really not too experienced of a cook, it may have been the combo of broccoli and cauliflower that made it too much for me, but I just didn't like it.

Really great and filling in a light way. That said, I stuck to lite soy sauce in place of oyster sauce (kosher old me) and used a chicken consomme in place of the broth. I also used a bag of mixed frozen broccoli, carrots, water chestnut (best. crunch. ever), snap peas and I threw in shitake mushrooms. Served it over brown rice - it came together quickly and easily, my man liked it and I'm looking forward to leftovers.

I thought this was a great recipe and my mom liked it too.  My 13-year-old brother ate a little and made a face, but I guess that's not surprising given his age.  I did make a few modifications: I used fresh rather than frozen carrots and broccoli and left out the cauliflower because my pan wasn't big enough for everything.  I also substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth and soy sauce for oyster sauce as I am a vegetarian, and used safflower oil rather than olive because that was what I had on hand.  Overall, I thought this was an excellent recipe.

This is one of my all-time favorites, and it has a special place in my heart as it was the recipe that introduced me to cooking tofu and helped led me onto the pescatarian track.

I like to use fresh veggies as well, and omit the chicken broth. Asparagus and baby corn both work well.

Blah flavor, OK presentation, but overall boring dish.  The only punch of flavor was garlic and salt - nice that it is fast and easy, but that's not enough to make it a good dish.

Brown the drained and pressed tofu alone in the oil a little first, to give more toasty flavor.  And add more garlic for a truly "wicked" experience!

So this is the start of my "one meatless meal a week of summer"  I picked this one because we like stir fry and tofu.  So here is the deal.  It was really, really good, but I made some changes/additions.  I stir fried the garlic and added 1/2 of jalopeno seeded and chopped fine and 3 T of fresh ginger peeled and chopped fine.  I than added the tofu along with the oyster sauce and let it cook.  Removed the tofu and added fresh carrots and fresh brocolli and stir fried until crisp tender than added the chicken stock and the rest of the oyster sauce and put a lid on it.  It was so tastey and we all liked.  I served with sesame noodles (my own recipe)  I will make this again my husband even said it was really good.  Now on to the next meatless meal!

It's definitely a very easy and healthy recipe. Instead of frozen veggies, I used fresh mushroom, carrots and snap peas.  I also added onion.  I did sauteed the garlic first before adding the tofu as other recommended which is a good call. Will definitely make this again.

This is a favorite stir-fry of our house. I used some frozen tofu that I had already drained and cubed and it made the recipe that much faster. I minced the garlic as others suggested and the scents were mouthwatering. I forgot to add the second half of the oyster sauce to the veggies so I dabbled a bit in when I added the tofu and it seemed to work fine.

Quick and excellent. I followed the other readers' suggestion and substituted chicken broth for water and I only used half the garlic. Thank's for sharing.

This is a nice recipe, but I found myself wondering where the "wicked" was, unless that comes from biting into a whole clove of garlic (which I intentionally avoid).  I had difficulty finding the garlic flavor, so I think if I make it again I will mince the garlic, and use less, since the flavor will come through better. I felt there was too much liquid after cooking the vegetables, so I would use less.  I do appreciate how quick & easy it was to make, especially on a day when I had very little energy for cooking.

I did not care for this at all and I love tofu, garlic and veggies.  Definitely wouldn't use frozen veggies again as the were mushy.  Didn't care for flavors.  Wouldn't make again - threw it out!

Great recipe.  I used fresh broccoli and carrots instead of the frozen veges, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and we gobbled it all up.  I found it slightly bland, so salt and peppered mine and that perked it up to my liking.  My husband and son liked it just as it was without further seasoning.  Next time I might add a pinch of red pepper flakes, but really, nothing is needed to make this a keeper of a recipe.

Fast. Easy and Tasty.  I used fresh broccoli and carrots in my recipe so i didn't need the broth, but if u want a little bit of a saucier dish for the rice or quinoa to soak up, then add a splash to the pan!  Make it!!!

I've never used oyster sauce before and I don't eat fish.  I smelled the sauce when i first opened it and almost didn't use it.  I cooked the tofu as directed, then cooked a chopped onion and a bag of frozen broccoli in a cup of chicken broth and the oyster sauce. I'd hoped to have enough sauce left over to thicken up, but there wasn't much.  When I served it, the oyster sauce was a little to strong for us.  I added a splash of soy sauce and it was perfect.  Next time I'll use more chicken broth and add the soy sauce up front, and thicken the sauce with cornstarch.  I will make it again.  Served over white rice.

This was awesome. I changed it though. The first time I made it as directed and would give it 4 stars. The next time I altered it.  I stir fried the tofu and garlic but I used 8-9 cloves of garlic. Then I removed the tofu and put an chopped onion in the pan. When it was somewhat softened I added 16 oz of fresh mushrooms. When they were soft I added vegetable broth and some hot sauce. I served it over jasmin rice the first time and saffron rice the second time. It makes a great mushroom and tofu dish!

This is tasty, but I *did* tweak it quite a bit.  After initially cooking the tofu, with half of the oyster sauce and the garlic, i thought it tasted gross (fishy), so I did NOT add any more oyster sauce to the dish.  I cooked fresh broccoli/carrot/cauliflower in some chicken broth (used the broth to add some additional flavor, since i didn't like the initial taste of oyster sauce in the tofu).  After re-tasting veggies & tofu mixed, it tasted much better.  I added Hot Sauce, and I felt that really did add some additional flavor and heat, i also added a little black pepper (we like our food spicy).  Also to note, I used 8 garlic cloves.  The end result is very tasty, so I give it a 5, for sending me in the right direction.  I do believe you need to watch carefully how much oyster sauce you're putting in, add extra garlic, and add the hot sauce.  Fresh veggies (as opposed to frozen) I imagine also probably made it tastier.

such a tasty dish! i dried the tofu overnight so it was nice and firm.  Instead of frozen, I used fresh 16 oz white mushrooms, 2 red bell peppers cut into strips then 1/2d and  one bunch of green onions cute into chunks. I added a bit extra oyster sauce, and it turned out SOOO tasty! i served it over buckwheat udon noodles. healthy and tasty! my hubby even got the last of the sauce and whiped it with a piece of bread. will make again!

I have never cooked with oyster sauce before and was a bit hesitant about it. I didn't have the vegetables called for in the recipe so I just used what I had in the house. I'm eating it right now and it's quite tasty, though next time I will try to get all the correct ingredients to really get a feel for it. Personally, I think more garlic would be great; the oyster sauce has a very pleasant, mild taste. I'm not disappointed.

Simple and very good! Only thing I would change next time is use a tsp less oyster sauce or add more vegetables, since it was more salty than I like (but not too bad when paired with rice). I used fresh veggies instead of frozen.

This was a pretty good recipe. Very simple but also pretty tasty. 
I always keep a pack of tofu in the fridge for those days when I don't the foresight or time to thaw out some meat, so this was great.
I only used 3 cloves of garlic (I love garlic, but am not to fond of the taste of it when cooked in liquid), and baked the tofu a little first to firm it up.
For the veggies, I used frozen asparagus with fresh zucchini and baby bella mushrooms. Came out really well.

A good addition, which I didn't think of until afterward, would be some fresh ginger and some spicy peppers. Will have to try it next time.

Really good one! Easy and yummy.  I'm a vegetarian so I substituted the Chicken Broth with Vegetable Broth and the Oyster Sauce with a Vegetarian version.  It's called Vegetarian Stir Fry Sauce (Mushroom Flavored) No idea if it actually tastes like Oyster Sauce but the man in the shop said it was the closest and it was yummy nonetheless.  

My eyes are still a bit watery from cooking the garlic, I may do a clove or so less next time but the taste was really nice.  I usually douse my stirfrys in sauce but this one seemed to have a more subtle taste that was just right.  For my veg I used frozen carrots, brocolli, cauliflower and corn.  Yum!

This recipe was only ok.  I don't know how people rated it so high.  I used even more oyster sauce then what was in the recipe, and it still lacked flavor.  I ended up adding some chili garlic sauce to add some kick to it.  I was suprised, because I LOVE tofu.  Too bad...

I give this 5 stars because what you get out of it for very little work is impressive. I followed the recipe except for using fresh (pre-bagged broccoli, carrot and snow peas), not frozen. I actually through them into the wok with the tofu (after 5 mins of tofu, garlic and oyster sauce saute) and put a lid on it instead of removing the sauted stuff. They steamed up nicely. We all used tangy hot sauce which was extra delicious.

Went with 10 cloves. Could have gone higher. Oyster sauce is necessary for this dish. Don't omit! 
Broth was unnecessary due to the moisture from frozen veggies. 
Excellent meal!

I'm really trying hard to eat healthy - but I hate starving myself.  I can eat almost as much of this as I want!!  I used a little less oyster sauce than recommended (had not used it before...it's potent!) and added about a teaspoon of red chili sauce. YUM! Ate it with out rice and was still satisfied.

I couldn't really taste the garlic, and the oyster sauce just gave it a kinda gross taste.

Loved this. My family usually complains about tofu being flavorless, but no such complaints this time. I used black bean sauce instead of the oyster sauce like another reviewer suggested. I also doubled the amount of garlic. Used vegetarian stock. I used fresh veggies, orange pepper, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. Served this with basmati rice. Will make this again, will try it with vegetarian oyster sauce next.

This was really good!  The only change I would make next time is to use fresh veggies.  THe frozen were lacking something.

This is now my favorite tofu recipe!  First, I steamed a crown of fresh broccoli, and a cup of fresh chopped carrots, and set them aside.  Then I fried a chopped, small onion and a pint of fresh sliced mushrooms, and mixed them with the carrots and broccoli.  Then I did Step 1 of the recipe directions.  After Step 1, I left everything in the pan, added the rest of the veggies I already cooked, and the oyster sauce (and a shot or two extra due to all of the veggies), and served the dish over brown rice.  I thought it was full of flavor, and my tofu-hating family absolutely loved it!

Very good but could have been more flavorful.  I couldn't taste the garlic and I added a lot more than called for.  Next time I will saute the garlic alone and add to the veggies.  Definately going to make it again though! So fast and easy!

The flavor was okay, kind of bland.  Not my favorite tofu recipe. Probably wouldn't try again.

very easy and tasty. but definitely NOT garlic-y. the recipe called for 6 cloves. i used 10 and still couldnt taste the garlic. i used all fresh vegetables (broccoli, carrots, onions, mushrooms) and water instead of chicken broth.  And it wasn't watery like others said. oyster sauce is essential. will make again for a quick meal.

This was very tasty!  I served it with plain white rice and there was enough sauce to moisten the rice nicely.  When cooking the vegetables, I would not drain the vegetables like the package directions indicate, unless you want very little sauce.  I did not drain the vegetables and the amount of sauce and consistency was perfect.

We were a bit unsure about this recipe since we weren't familiar w/ oyster sauce, but it was delicious. Next time we will definitely serve it over rice and add some more veggies.

This is so yummy, it doesn't taste healthy. We love it and have it as a meal with brown rice often.

I am somewhat new to cooking with tofu and I found this recipe to be one of my favorites so far!  I will definately be making it again soon!  I also minced the garlic.

This was absolutely delicious! I used just water, instead of chicken broth, to cut back on the saltiness. I used frozen broccoli, peas and carrots, since they were out of the broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mix. And, like suggested, I minced the garlic. It turned out great! It's a definite winner in my house!
