Wow what a surprise, Excellent.  Everyone loved this cake.  Next time I will add less raisins but, that is the only change.  A winner in our house and among our friends.

I have found I switch up white vinegar in recipes for cider vinegar.   I also grind my raisins in the blender first too, the flavor is throughout the whole pie.
I love to switch recipes to a blender recipe with all ingredients so will try that with this. Top with a few chopped raisins.  Mix the light and dark raisins would look nice!

My mother is from Norway and has NEVER heard of sour cream raisin pie, but maybe it's a regional thing (she's from the southeast coast).  Regardless, it sounded intriguing and I had some raisins to use up.  

I made it exactly to recipe, using half golden and half dark raisins.  Admittedly it wasn't the prettiest pie I've ever seen come out of the oven, and we were unsure how to tell if it was done.  But we let it bake 50 minutes, cool on a rack for about 10 mins, then popped it in the fridge for about an hour.  It was VERY good, and the perfect dessert to follow the really spicy dinner we had (Sausage & Chicken Etouffee) -- it cooled off our palates nicely.  :)  The pie was not nearly as sweet as I was worried it may be after reading a few reviews, and I have no idea how folks are getting a dry texture as mine was very moist (almost runny, but not in an unappetizing way).  And I loved how flaky the crust came out, I had figured with such a wet filling, it may be soggy, but it wasn't at all!  

We'll definitely make this one again!

My friends and I had a night in when we made 1 pie recipe each, and I decided to do something unusual. It definitely does have an interesting taste. We were all 50/50 about it--kind of like black licorice. You either don't care for it or absolutely love it. I can easily say I love this pie enough to make it for Thanksgiving!

The texture was very much like the restaurant I was trying to emulate, the flavor was exceptional and the cooking times were exactly right as it was not over nor under cooked. Highly recommend!

I thought this pie had way too much spice and so did my husband.The pie turned out fine as far as consistency and baked in exactly the time stated on the recipe.  I won't make this one again, but if I did I would add only the cinnamon and omit the cloves and nutmeg completely, and maybe add a little vanilla.  Some reviewers mention they would chop the raisins, I think that would be good also.

Flavor was very good but must've missed something as the texture was not custard-like in the slightest and wasn't smooth as it should be.

GREAT pie!! Im not sure how it could be dry.... I dont add the full cup of sugar, I think a little sweet. I like to add a little more raisins, golden & dark raisins. A MUST try. VERY easy to make too.

Delicious pie! Had to try it out. What part of Norway is this from? My wife and I live in Oslo and have never heard of this...assuming it is an old school recipe that hasn't held popularity in Norway today or regional.

This was great! Good complex flavor!  I did make some very minor changes.  (a) I used slightly fewer raisins, (b) I chopped raisins a little, (c) used a gluten-free crust (d) put slightly less of each spice except the cinnamon, which I kept the same. My wife and I both loved the grown-up flavors this pie created. This flavor should go well with a Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner. I would actually give this 4.5 stars as it was a little hard to know when the pie was done and really would be even better with some whipped cream topping. Also, I had to cook for about 60 min. I will plan to make again.

Made it just as the recipe said except for trying to chop the raisins a bit.  I made two pies for an auction today.  Looks plenty moist and came out just right.  I will not be the judge of it  tastes good or not but I bet they will like it.

My mother was Norwegian and this recipe is the closest  I've found to hers. I prepared this exactly as written and it was terrific. Even my husband liked it and he's a picky guy. He said it reminded him of his grandmother's Butter Tarts. I think it's our new favorite pie.

I am not sure what I did wrong but both me and my husband did not care for this at all. It was too dry.
