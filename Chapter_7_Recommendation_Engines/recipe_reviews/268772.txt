I never would have thought  adding black pepper to a drink would make it so good. We absolutely loved this and wouldn't change a thing. It's perfection just as written!

This one is a winner, not too sweet and not too much alcohol.  It would also be easy to make a larger batch for a crowd.

This was fabulous and a perfect drink for the Holidays! I didn't change a thing except omitting the pepper on top as per my guests request. A great warm up for winter! Will be making again!

This was really tasty. I'm usually not a fan of Chai but with white chocolate and Baileys? You bet it was so good. My daughter also enjoyed this drink minus the Baileys. So with or without it's a great warm and cozy drink.

Great recipe Baileyâ€™s!!! I loved the peeper, it works great with the drink. The chai flavor is not overpowering and works well with the white chocolate and the liquor.  A great drink to share with friends and family during the holidays.

This is my favorite of all the Baileys recipes!  If you have a sweet tooth like I do, you are going to love this drink!  I am not a tea drinker, but the chai tea infused into this drink was luscious!  I did use the marshmallows on top, but I think I'd prefer a barely sweetened whip cream instead.  Very nice recipe!  Thank you so much, Baileys!

This was delicious. I was skeptical on the pepper but it blended perfectly with the drink. It wasn't overly sweet and was very rich. Definitely a great drink to enjoy on a cold night by the fire!
