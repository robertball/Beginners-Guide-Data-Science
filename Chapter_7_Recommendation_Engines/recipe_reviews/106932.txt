These are good but I disagree about the process. The original must be dipped in sweetened condensed milk then dipped into the coconut flakes. Toast over the coals of the fire carefully just as you would brown a marshmellow. The flavors meld together which they do not do if you toast the bread only. Big difference in taste!

gotta watch that the kids don't dip first and then toast....unless you enjoy the flame burnt taste that is! Thanks for a nice change for campfire desserts. And easy to pack ingredients too.

The components were good together but failed at execution. Tried dipping the cake squares in condensed milk and then coconut to get the toasted coconut finish but the milk and coconut coating kept dripping off the cake and into the fire.

This treat was a big hit at our annual bonfire! Everyone who tried it loved it. I added mini chocolate chips and multi color sprinkles as options in addition to the coconut. This will definitely be on the menu next year!

We used to make this at Girl Scout camp! It's been probably forty years since then but we made it with bread. For someone that didn't care for coconut we dipped the bread in the condensed milk and toasted that on a marshmallow fork until it was brown and crusty... A drizzle of chocolate syrup made it like a warm candy bar. That was sooo good.... and obviously a best memory of Girl Scout camp. I did this with my own kids when we went camping too.

I agree with @wildduck this is supposed to be toasted AFTER it is dredged in the sweetened condensed milk and coconut. When we were kids we made this in foil pouches... spray the foil with cooking spray first and then it wont fall apart on you!

I made these for a fun family night treat and broiled them (turning to toast on each side) in the oven on parchment paper. I served them with ice cream and they were a huge hit! But the ice cream definitely wasn t necessary - they re a great finger food!! The next time I made them I heated the sweetened condensed milk in a small glass container in the microwave (so it wasn t as thick and I could therefore make more) before rolling them in the coconut flakes.:-D YUM!! A friend also suggested trying 1 slices since I m broiling them instead of trying to keep them on a skewer. I think I ll try that next time if I m in a hurry.:-) Thanks for a fabulous recipe!
