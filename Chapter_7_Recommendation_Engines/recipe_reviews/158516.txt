Okay, I very rarely review recipes, but I had to on this one. My non-english speaking Vietnamese girlfriends mom gave me a thumbs up for this dish.
I did of course make changes: 
Used 8 cups of shrimp stock(4 shrimp boullion cubes in 8 cups of water), 3-10 oz cans of straw mushrooms drained, 1-8 oz can of sliced Bamboo Shoots drained, 1 brick of firm Tofu sliced into 3/4 inch cubes, 3 Roma tomatoes seeded and chopped into 1 inch pieces, Fish sauce to taste about 6 Tbls, 1 Tbls White pepper and 2 pounds of frozen Cocktail Shrimp .
Served with Lime wedges, Cilantro, blanched Bean Sprouts, Hot Chili oil, Pho noodles and Rice prestaged on the dinner table so individuals could adjust hot and sour to their own taste, and choose to eat plain or with noodles or rice. Hope this helps. Stu

Just what I needed to use up some limes. Easy preparation, quick and delicious meal. I used large shrimp--made the shrimp broth with the shells, then proceeded with the recipe.

OMG!!! Anytime I make shrimp, either grilled, bbq, or just boiled, I take the shells and cook down a stock with a small amount of water with the leftover shells. I had 8 cups sitting in my freezer and made this...to die for! After doubling the recipe, I added a large can of bean sprouts, some yellow miso paste, rice noodles and sriracha for spice since I didn't have red chile peppers. This is a great recipe. A definite keeper!

I am going to rate this a 5 because my family LOVED it. I was looking for a totally different hot and sour soup, so it didn't satisfy me. It was not hot at all, even in the least bit. it was alright, I wasn't expecting it to taste so shrimpy though. I do recommend you try it though, since my family absolutely raved about it.

My BF  and I made this this weekend. He wanted a soup that reminded him of one he used to get from a Thai woman at a restaurant when he wasn't feeling good. We made a stock with the shrimp shells (used big, rather than salad sized, which we think was the right choice...at least for us) and added some clam juice and fish stock concentrate to the liquid. In the soup he wanted lemon grass like he was used to in the one from the restaurant. We used the canned mushrooms and also added some fresh shitake. We used a whole tube of Gourmet Garden's finely chopped red chilies because we couldn't find fresh. We like things HOT. This was nowhere near hot enough for us so we kept adding until it reached our desired heat level. We also doubled the cilantro because we love that flavor as well. Many of these ingredients are very salty. I was worried that our stock was not salty enough and a bit too bland, but when everything was added it was PLENTY salty, so I suggest not adding extra salt until the end. We loved this and he said it was just like the one from the restaurant. We had a blast making this together. I would have rated this a four but my BF was so happy with it that it gets a five:)  Thank you so much!++++Just made this again and added some mussels and used oyster sauce because we couldn't find our fish sauce. Added lots of heat and-again- this was a great soup. Easy to get down when my stomach was upset.

Absolutely Loved IT!  It's superb, but a milder and easier version of the Thai soup~Tom Yum Goong.  I added red curry paste and tamarind sauce; tripled the mushrooms~oyster and button.  Finish off with bean sprouts.  Definitely a repeat!

This soup was super hot and sour just as it claimed and I wouldn't change a thing except for maybe using some bean sprouts for garnish next time. Thanks for sharing!

Didn't see scrimp stock in the store so we used Fish Stock instead. Was not a great idea.  Tasted like fish vomit.  Fish stock sounded like a replacement for scrimp stock but there must be reason not to substitute between these.

This soup was very easy and turned out great.  I used bigger shrimp that I cooked in the broth, and I served it with thin rice noodles.  Very tasty.

Love the base. Surprised at how complex the flavors are. I personally like my soup to eat like a meal so I added bean sprouts, carrots, celery and 7oz rice noodles. Since I added so much extra I also added 8 more cups of water/lobster stock.

Great soup.  Easy to make but I did make modifications.  4 cups of broth is not enough for my soup loving family.  I used chicken broth.  Roughly 8 cups broth, 2 cups water.  I might have added one additional Tbls of cilantro but you might want to taste before adding.  One small jalapeno and three scallions was just right for 10 cups broth.  I used fresh mushrooms and added sliced water chestnuts.  I tried a cup without lime juice and one with.  I preferred without lime juice.  Do the zest, just no extra juice.  Simple and tasty.

i was worried at first bc of the amount of liquid, but it came out really good.. didn't have shrimp stock so i used some bullion instead, used fresh slice mushrooms, used large shrimp that i sauteed with a bit of lemon pepper seasoning salt, used soy instead of fish sauce and reduced it about a third, used jalapeno instead of the red chile pepper and kept most of the seeds/vein in.. me and bf totally enjoyed this.. ty for the recipe

I liked the soup and the direction it was going. I did as another reviewer did and finely chopped up a stalk of lemongrass. I also had on hand spinach and portobello mushrooms so those also went in. I added more thai chilis as i

Just made this tonight to match another Asian dish and it was wonderful!  At first, I thought there was too much lime/sour taste, but I couldn't stop eating it.  Family gave the thumbs up to repeat!

fish sauce is hard to find if you live in a less Urban area. I found mine to be a bit too spicy, but was a very good soup, might tone it down next time.
