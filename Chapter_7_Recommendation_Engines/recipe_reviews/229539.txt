This "Marinated Chicken with Maille Dijon Originale Mustard" is the perfect recipe for working people: very delicious and so fast and easy to make! I can imagine that I would love a "hot chicken salad" made with this chicken and that the chicken would also be an excellent base for a cold chicken sandwich. My seasonal vegetables (beets parsnips celeriac yams carrots and onions) took 1.5 hours to roast in the oven (4 stars for my veggies). I will definitely be making the chicken part of this recipe again many many more times. Thank you Maille for sharing your recipe.

I added mustard powder to make it extra mustardy. It was very good!
