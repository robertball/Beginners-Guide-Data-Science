This has been a hit at our local peach festival for 2 years now.  It's actually requested for donation.  I love it. It is very easy and it has a lovely flavor.  You can also use a graham cracker crust if you like.  The only thing is that it does get runny if it sits too long so only add the preserves right before serving. It's light and perfect for summertime.

I almost didn't rate b/c I did need to change it up some.  I added a pkg . of vanilla pudding and about 3/4 cup of milk to help it set up quickly.  I used a graham crust as suggested by another reviewer, too.  Fresh peaches and berries on top that I tossed in some homemade strawberry jam.  Very pretty & nice for a summer day when you would rather leave your oven off.

This is really good and quick to make.  I added more sugar and almond extract to the cream cheese mixture and omitted the preserves.  It was definitely a hit!

This was a fantastic summer pie, very refreshing.  Next time I think I'll layer slightly differently.  Perhaps half the cream cheese, then half the peaches then raspberry sauce.  Repeat.  Also, I'd use more peaches and raspberry sauce and put chopped mint mixed into the preserves and lemon juice.  Thanks for the idea!

You created an amazing base recipe!  I made this like so many others with pudding/milk and the graham cracker I recipe from this site with cinnamon, nutmeg and clove in the crust as well as the peach mixture.  I also added about 2 Tbsp of key lime juice to the cream cheese base to give it that fresh summery kick.  WOW!  Thanks for an amazing idea (recipes like this that are great no matter how they are done are my favorite!!!!)

Absolutely delicious. First pie I ever made, and I cannot get enough of it! I made this with a French Pastry Crust ( recipe on this site)  that was sweet and rich with flavor, and it only made the Peach Surprise that more amazing. Highly recommended on both recipes that love flavorful food.

This was nice for a simple dessert. However, I found the cream cheese layer heavy in texture and flavor - it needs something to break up the taste of the cheese and lighten up the texture. I actually like the suggestion from the reviewer who added the vanilla pudding and milk. I would try that. I also tried out the French Pastry crust recipe from this site (another great reviewer suggestion) which was wonderful, but I actually think this recipe is more suited to a vanilla cookie or graham crumb crust.

I read through the review's carefully before I made this pie. I did choose to make a graham crust for this pie instead of using a pastry pie crust. Though the filling was nice, I think it was a little heavy when paired with the peaches and raspberry drizzle. I think I might play with this recipe a bit, then re-review.

Made 2- one with graham cracker crust and one pastry- Graham cracker was by far better and a bigger hit!  I used homemade raspberry-peach jam for the preserves.  I think next time I'll add some lime juice/lime zest to make it pop.  I did as other reviewers on adding 1 small vanilla pudding & 3/4 cup milk to the cream cheese.  Also, I used fresh peaches and added it right before serving.

Kinda tart. Definitely not enough sugar in the cream cheese.

Easy breezy!!!!!! I didn't have any raspberry perseveres so I used strawberry preserves. The cream cheese filling isn't really sweet so when I serve I will sprinkle confectioners sugars on the slices.

Substituted half the cream cheese for sour cream because of what we had on hand, replaced sugar with honey, and added 2T lime juice like someone else mentioned. Skipped the raspberry topping. All ages LOVED it! One of the best cheese pies I have had (I've had many). I don't think the cheese pie would work without the fruit topping. It's not overly sweet like many pies are. Next time we'll try a different fruit. This is a keeper.
