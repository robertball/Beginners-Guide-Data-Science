Wonderful!  It's hard to believe it's a quick bread instead of a yeast bread.  Versatile enough for almost any dish.  I used nonfat buttermilk and I couldn't imagine how it could have tasted better.

I took this soda bread to a St Patrick's Day party - it got rave reviews, and several people asked for the recipe.

Very good bread.  So sweet and moist. I served it with a German meal of dumplings and Sauerbraten for my Grandmother and other relatives and everyone raved about it.

Very good bread.  Smoother crumb than I usually find in soda breads, so it's a nice change of pace.  I think it got a little dry by the next day, so eat it right out of the oven for best results.  Loved the sweetness.

Seriously amazing, and seriously easy to make.  I love the flavour of fennel - but even if you don't particularly like fennel, it's subtle and adds a nice punch to the bread.  Almost everyone I've served this to has asked for the recipe!

Oh yum!  We loved this recipe!  I reduced the sugar just a smidge and cooked this in my cast iron pan.  I did not have buttermilk, so I added a teaspoon or two of white vinegar to regular 2% milk and let it sit about ten minutes before using it.  The recipe certainly didn't seem to suffer because it came out fantastic.  I served this hot out of the oven with corned beef and veggies.  The loaf was huge, so we ate it for days as breakfast and with the leftover corned beef.  If I can find a small cast iron pan, I'd like to try halving the recipe since there are only two of us.  Thanks for helping this Irish girl make her first Irish meal.

Delicious bread! My husband thought it was too sweet, so next time I might reduce the amount of sugar. Nice hot out of the oven or toasted the next day.

How can something that is so easy to make taste so good???  This soda bread was the star of my dinner.  Tasty, easy to make - the whole family loved it.  We had it with chicken in a hot and sweet sauce but it would also be great with any dinner that has lots of gravy.  Next time I might experiment with reducing the sugar but it was great just as it is. Yum!

This is a wonderful variation on soda bread.  I wound up using 1 cup bread flour, 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup AP because I needed to shop and it still came out just wonderful.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and I think that is just enough.  We prefer savory to sweet.  I also baked it in a 8" square pan because I don't have a 10" cake pan and kept my fingers crossed that it would not over flow.  Thank you for a terrific recipe.

I give this recipe five stars because it's so unusual! I'm not a big fan of fennel, but felt like I needed to try this recipe anyway. I really like it! It wasn't a huge hit with everyone who ate it, but it's definitely a conversation piece. I'll probably make it again, but it would be for a large crowd as it makes a lot of bread for a family of 2.5!

I made this for a fennel-themed party, and it was a huge hit!  I didn't change a thing, and I will make this often in the future.  It was very moist and perfectly sweet - I served it hot as an appetizer, but it could be served with tea and coffee as a light dessert as well.  It's still soft the next day.

Had to give this bread 5 stars, to make sure I didn't hurt it's rating.  Mine didn't turn out because I only had an 8-inch cake pan (which shouldn't hurt your rating, just my pride, lol).  But, the part that stayed in the pan and did cook was really yummy.  Fennel is good for tummy troubles so I was looking for a way to get it into my diet.  This was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good, but be warned, it is very cake-like in texture! I reduced the sugar by half because I wanted a more savory sort of bread, and it was still sweet and delicious. Once the leftovers get too tough to eat, try making French toast with it--it's surprisingly yummy for that!

I just made this tonight for Halloween and loved it! I was skeptical about the fennel but it was subtle and scrumptious.

When I saw the fennel in this I was intrigued and decided to make half the recipe in an 8" cake pan.  This baked up beautifully.  The taste was good, the fennel was subtle and I liked it the first day.  The second day the crust had lost some of it's crispness and wasn't nearly as good.  To salvage it, I decided to toast it which did improve it somewhat.  I doubt that I'll be making this one again, but it was fun to try.

Wonderful 5-STAR recipe! Make sure you eat it while it's warm (you'll find it hard to stop at just one slice!). Goes great with Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup!

Loved it just as written.  I should have cooked it the whole hour but it seemed done before then. It wasn't, even tho' it tested clean with a knife.  I used a 9" springform pan which probably contributed to the 'rawness'.  This was delicious!!!

Incredible! This was the best soda bread recipe I've tried. I'd compare the sweetness to cornbread. The amount of fennel seed was perfect. It was great on its own, in an open-faced sausage sandwich, and in French toast.

Wow, yummy. Had no buttermilk, so I did half 0% fat greek yogurt and half soured milk. Figured my fennel seeds had been around a few years, so I first placed them within some wax paper and whacked them with the metal mallett to release flavor. Fun project for adult son and I to easily make on St. Pat's Day, and everyone loved the aroma, and taste. I used a 10" diameter pie plate.

This is really very good and so, so easy.  I had to bake mine in a rectangular pan, but it turned out great.  The fennel taste is there, but it's not overpowering.  I served it with Cheeseburger Vegetable Soup made with Johnsonville Italian Sausage instead of ground beef, and the fennel in the sausage was a wonderful compliment to this delicious bread.  Definitely will be making this one again.  Thanks!!!

Made recipe as written. Was orginally made to go with sausage and beans but was so good, we finished the bread and put the sausage and beans in the fridge for leftovers. There was no leftover bread!!!

I've made this recipe for years and my family loves it. I do add a tablespoon of dill, I felt like it needed something with the fennel and the addition was perfect. Even my pickiest eater loves this bread. I've also used it as a topping for Shepard's Pot Pie. Thank you for the recipe!!

Very delicious. I had some fennel seeds from my garden that were nice and plump green colored and they were perfect. I did make a half recipe as there were only 3 of us, and paired the bread with salmon. I didn't have buttermilk and used whole  milk plus 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar. I did put less sugar as we prefer less sweet (if it were a whole recipe, would have been a scant half cup). I cooked it as directed in a 9x5 bread pan on the bottom shelf of the oven and it was done in about 30 min. I would make this again.

Even though I cut the sugar by half it was still too sweet. And the amount of fennel seed really made it taste like licorice. Not what I expected in a soda bread :-(

This recipe is amazing!! I am a big fan of fennel seeds anyway, but the taste and texture of this bread blew us away. I would probably, like some other reviewers, reduce the sugar next time but I can see a whole lot of this bread in our future. ??

I added close to 3 cups of white raisins and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Excellent

Really good - not too sweet or fennel tasting. My first time making soda bread and am surprised how moist & high it is. I served it at room temperature spread with butter and will try it toasted today...will make again, as well as try other flavors!

This is simple, quick and one of the best textures I have seen.   I substituted half whole wheat flour and added some crushed flax seeds for extra nourishment.   Truly a keeper!
