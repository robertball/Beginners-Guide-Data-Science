Didn't have any cream cheese to make the glaze, but was looking for a good buttermilk waffle recipe.  First time, made the recipe as listed (minus the red food color).  A bit too much salt and the vinegar was weird.  It may be perfect with the glaze?  Second batch, 1/2 tsp salt and no vinegar.  Perfect!  Super crispy and delicious!  The batter is perfect for the waffle maker.

Great recipe, didn't make any changes and just as it is. Fluffy batter and great fluffy end result! Easy peasy for a sunday morning. I skipped the glaze though... Ok maybe a little change.

Not my favorite. I followed the recipe exactly. The waffles turned out OK. The recipe for the glaze was WAY too much. I feel like I could have made 1/2 the amount and it still would have been more than plenty. I could have saved myself some money on that one. Probably won't make this recipe again.
