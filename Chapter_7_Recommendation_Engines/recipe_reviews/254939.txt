Very simple and subtly delicious! Followed the recipe but I just sprinkled a little pepper on the drumsticks. Recommend covering the pan during the second half of cooking time.

It was very bland even after I doubled the honey, mustard and used minced jarred garlic in addition to extra powdered garlic and let it sit for a few hours.  It's good for people who aren't big fans of seasoning.  The sauce  tasted good on my rice but the chicken was very eh.  I would definitely add a lot more seasoning to this chicken.  You could barely taste the orange.  Maybe some zest would have helped or a real orange.  I'm going to reheat tomorrow after it sits in the sauce and see if the flavor sinks in.

I have to agree with another reviewer quite bland. I marinated all day and flavor hardly existed

It was edible, but bland.  I did not marinade it, but have tasted chicken with salt and pepper that had more flavor.  I squeezed a clementine instead of the orange juice, and used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon.  Maybe that ruined it.

I love it! I used Amino Liquid instead of soy sauce. This is now one of my favs!

Easy Honey Garlic Chicken Haiku: "Not bad, but not wow. Marinated all day long, flavor didn't pop." I used 6 drumsticks and halved the recipe, using it as a marinade as mentioned in cook's notes. Baking time was right on, and the drumsticks (skinless for ours) were sticky, but not particularly flavorful at all. Doubling the sauce, marinating AND basting would've resulted in a tastier chicken methinks.
