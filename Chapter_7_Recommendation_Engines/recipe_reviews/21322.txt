This salmon was delicious-- browned on the outside, moist on the inside, and surprisingly flavorful. I don't think I'd call it "spicy" with bell peppers (I could imagine that hot peppers could be substituted for some fire) but I liked it as it is. I made some changes: I cooked my salmon and peppers in the same skillet (first the salmon, then the peppers) and the same olive oil-- this helped the flavors mingle. I also sprinkled kosher salt and fresh ground pepper on the salmon before searing it. Finally, I crushed three cloves of garlic and put them right into the olive oil. I really liked the flavor this lent. The best thing about this recipe was how quick it was: the salmon took about 5 minutes to cook, and was very flavorful without ever marinating!

Very nice.  But two skillets?  You can easily put in the peppers, oil, garlic and lemon while the salmon is frying... I did.  And it wanted a quater cup of heavy cream for a smoother, less oily sauce.

First I have to say that this was my first time to have salmon.  I didn't like it, but my husband did.  We skipped the bell peppers.  The lemon/garlic sauce is a must for flavor.  It is NOT spicy as the description states though.

My fiance made these and they had a very good flavor. He overcooked them a little bit but was still good. We served them with AllRecipes Bella's Rosemary Red Potatoes, green beans, and italian bread.

I only had salmon patties from Trader Joes on hand and applied it to this recipe.  Used other suggestions of using on pan and all I can say is YUMMMM!!!!  My 5 yr old helped out and ate 1/2 of my patty.  I served it on a bun with the peppers topping the patty.  YUM, YUM....

Excellent flavor combo!  This was easy and fast to prepare and was very good.  I substituted olive oil, garlic powder, and lemon juice so I wouldn't have to run out to the store, but it was very good.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Made recipe almost as written, but lightly seasoned the fillets with the basics -- salt and pepper, which I think saved this dish a little. Something was missing. The cooking directions are off, but it could be a personal preference. Please do not pour raw garlic + lemon over finished salmon. I don't know anyone who cares for raw garlic and would add the garlic to the oil just before adding the salmon to let it infuse with the butter (or oil if you sub), or add the garlic with the bell peppers in step two. Then, add lemon juice towards the end of cooking salmon or just before serving. Otherwise, the fish was bland for us and in need of something more. I will have to play with the 2 leftover fillets tonight to fix seasoning while trying to avoid drying them out.

I made this all in one pan.  I like garlic so I quickly sautéed garlic before putting the salmon in to pan fry.  The peppers, garlic and lemon were added and all cooked along with the salmon.  The flavors mixed well and it was all good.  I served sautéed jalapeño peppers with lemon wedges for those who wanted a bit of a kick.  My guests loved it!

Recipe lacked some direction, but overall good substance. Turned out great. I added some salt and pepper while pan searing. As well as a bed of brown rice to lay it on. Added as a side dish asparagus and cherry tomatoes with Parmesan cheese.
