Made recipe exactly as called for but used a springform pan on a trivet .  AMAZING!  Kids loved it!  (I would make extra sauce to serve with it next time)
***I also cooked it with a bunch of halved potatoes and 1 cup chicken broth + 1/2 stick butter + 1/4 cup Parmesan in the bottom, which I then blended.  So we got yummy mashed potatoes and meatloaf out of one 25 minute Instapot meal! (If you do this, skip the water in the pot called for in the recipe)***

the only change I made was to use about 1/4 cup freshly chopped onion.  The potatoes were way overdone, but the meatloaf was cooked properly.  I did not put it under the broiler to finish; it was finished just fine.  I think if I do this again, I will set the timer for only 18 minutes, and then finish the loaf under the broiler.  I also was not a big fan of the balsamic in the glaze.  I think it would have been better with about 1/2 of the vinegar and adding 2-3 Tbls. of brown sugar....which is what I will use next time.

This was my first use of an Instant Pot.  Meatloaf is a favorite of my. wife.  I made recipe exactly as described and we both thought this was very good.  Next time may make more sauce to serve at table side:  2 lb of ground beef make a large amount of meatloaf.  Will be looking for more instant pot recipes, hopefully as good as this one.  Thanks for sharing with the community.

Will make it again; halved it this time.  Will make the full batch next time.  1 lb. beef made 2 mini-loaves and just fit in the Instant Pot.  Cooked it on Hi Pressure for 15 minutes + 10 min natural release to hit 160 degrees.  Will not broil it next time.  Just top with glaze and pop in oven for a few minutes.  Was just a bit over done with the broiling and didn't need it for color once the glaze was on.  Apples were great and not too sweet.  I chose the recipe because I had an extra apple that I needed to use.  Glad I did.  Thx Cybergy.

Pretty good taste. Would like to know which size pot the author used, wondering if it made a difference. My meat came out done on the ends and sides, middle was extremely rare. meat thermometer read 110 when we took it out of the broiler. Rather than wait for the pot to build up pressure, we put it in the oven at 350 until the internal temperature said 160, about 25 more minutes! 

Unlike another person who said there's wasn't done due to his/her total meat weight being 2.25 instead of the 2lbs called for, mine was exactly two pounds (I've noticed at Wally Mart the 1lb packages are marked exactly one pound, the two lb packages are marked 2.25...not sure about other stores). 

Would also like to know what fat ratio the author used, to see if that makes a difference. My beef was 97/3. 

I was surprised at how good it tasted after it was done. I've never put apples in my meatloaf before. Other than the apples and the topping, it was identical to what we usually make (we only use ketchup on the top...not a fan of BBQ sauce on meatloaf, which is what ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar give you). 

I'd give this five stars for taste, and three for not enough information, so four it is! :-)

I loved it.  Made a couple of changes.  No apples (didn't have one)  Italian bread crumbs not plain and added one egg.  Didn't make the topping and used what I had...last of the ketchup and Sweet Baby Ray barbeque sauce.  mixed the two and brushed on.  Preheated oven to 400 and set timer for 15 minutes.  Perfect.  I looked in the pot before taking out and saw the grease in the foil so I took a knife and poked a hole and drained it into the water before transferring to a pan.

This was fantastic, and will definitely make again! I was a little worried about the meat being underdone based on a couple other reviews, so I cooked it for 30 minutes instead of 25. It came out right at 160º, and was delicious! I added an egg because the meat mixture was a little crumbly, and hot paprika because I put it in everything, and it was perfect. I loved the apples, they added a lot of moisture and nice texture, but not too much sweetness. The sauce on top was tasty, too. Great recipe!

I used a slightly different recipe.  Ok a lot different.  25 minutes didn't fully cook the  2.25 lb loaf.  8 minutes in the microwave to finish it up. I just used Lipton onion soup mix, 1 egg, 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs.  Mix the wet with the soup mix, add the bread crumbs, mix well, add meat, mix well, cook.  It's delicious.

Horrible. Pressure cooker wouldn’t pressurize. I cooked in the oven. It was just plain ground beef , ketchup and mustard. I felt I was eating a hamburger

This came out delicious! However, I found that 1/2 cup of water in the bottom was not enough and I got a Burn message. I had to stop and add a whole cup and start again.

Husband approved. 
I like the apple in it. I used a package of onion soup mix instead of chopped onion and added 1/4 cup of Steak sauce. 
I cooked the meatloaf for 30 minutes, then quick release. I didn’t put it under the broiler before I glazed it. I glazed it, then put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. 
I put some baby white potatoes at the bottom of the pot, used 1 cup beef broth. The potatoes were perfect.

FINALLY!  I halved this recipe since I live alone and followed it to the letter (as I do with any new recipe......I can always tweak it next time).
This was AMAZING.......I have a small, high side pan that came with my air fryer and I used that in my 3 qt. Instant Pot and set it for 40 minutes and put 2 red skin potato's in with and let it go.
When it was done I released the pressure, took my potato's out for mashing and drained the "liquid" in my meatloaf pan.  I mixed the sauce for the top but added a bit more sweet for me and put it in my oven and let the top "dry out" and put the sauce over it and let it set.  Sliced, plated and ate and I loved it.  I was shocked about the apples but I could not detect any apple flavor and I made my own breadcrumbs from crusty bread.  Basically, this is the first "GOOD" meatloaf I have made in a long time and I am making this AGAIN!  THANK YOU for posting this.  
OH!  I put foil over the meatloaf in my IP and placed the taters on top if that helps anyone.

I used 2.25 lbs of 85/15 ground beef plus 1 lb of 96/4 ground beef (that's what I had on hand). I adjusted the quantities of everything up slightly. I made two meatloafs out of this -- one for now and one to freeze. I put the sauce on before cooking. I also added an egg to make it bind together better. I also add worcestshire sauce to the meat mixture. There were no leftovers!

This meat loaf blew me away. I thought it was weird at first putting apples in it, but it totally works. The only change I would make for next time is adding less mustard to the sauce, but that's a personal preference. Otherwise, SSOOOOOOO good!!!

Excellent recipe!  Only change I made was to use 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork sausage. The sausage gives meatloaf much needed flavor. It held together nicely and tasted great. The topping sauce was a little too tangy for our taste.  Will cut mustard quantity in half next time I make this.  I cooked it with the halved potatoes and Parmesan under the meatloaf as another reviewer recommended. The mashed potatoes were amazing too!

Yes, I would make it again.

I've made this twice and loved it.  I changed some of the ingredients a little and left out the apple.  I browned it on the stove top in my cast iron skillet before I put it in the instant pot.  I reduced the cook time 5 minutes because of the browning time.  Carrots, small potatoes on the bottom, with seasonings and a can of chicken broth.

Tasted delicious but could not cut the loaf. It instantly fell apart into a pile of meat. Maybe 1/4 cup of water next time.

It was meatloaf. It tastes fine but not special, and the recipe was too big for our Instant Pot so the meatloaf was not even halfway cooked with the time in the recipe (because the meatloaf was thicker than it would have been in a bigger instant pot). Next time I'll double the time to see if that helps. I don't think this was any better than making a regular meatloaf, though it saves a little bit of time if you can get the minutes on the instant pot right for your meatloaf and your instant pot.

I loved it. I didn't have any salt or black pepper in home so I used paprika and Noodles seasoning. Fortunately it came out great. It makes lots of extra sauce so I used the extra to put on the slices.

I think this was the best meatloaf I have ever made. It was very easy and I made mashed potatoes with it too.
