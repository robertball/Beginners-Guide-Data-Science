I love this one.  I do not add the lime zest and I always use extra lemon juice (I juice a whole lemon which is 1/3 of a cup).  I think this recipie is the best.  I add chicken to it or sliced sauteed mushrooms, it's a restaurant quality recipie and is very easy to make.  It does not reheat for leftovers though.

This was a FANTASTIC idea! Granted, I modified a bit. I used half-n-half, and added artichokes, asparagus, fresh tomatoes, and mushrooms to the sauce. But I love the idea of a lemon-cream base. Thank you Holly, my guests were so pleased, and so was I!

This recipe was fabulous! I do not think that the zest is neccesary though. I used 4 tablespoons of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of lime juice instead of the lemon and lime zest. I also added chicken and broccoli and used chicken broth instead of beef broth. Overall, this was a great recipe and I will definately use it again! I would not suggest this recipe to people who do not like tart food, but for those who do, this is one you must try!

Absolutely wonderful!We had it over fettuccine, asparagus and lemon pepper chicken and it was devine. I used chicken broth instead of beef. Please note that reducing sauce takes time.To achieve a thicker sauce Have Patience! It will definately be worth it.I will use this recipe again and again.

Wonderful recipe.  I didn't have Heavy cream so I used 2% milk and then added just a touch of Corn starch as a thickening agent.  Worked wonderful.

Very nice basic sauce with a twist (of citrus). Would be a perfect side to go with any seafood or poultry entree, or a great main course by tossing seafood/poultry right in. I used chicken broth, and made a main dish out of it by adding a little garlic, toasted pine nuts and steamed broccoli florets, and am eager to try it again with asparagus. The possibilities are endless. We sprinkled on parmesan at the table. Passed the picky kid test, too. Keeper!!

Great sauce, Holly.  I used fat-free "half & half" (will use cream next time as there was an odd coagulation going on with the fat-free 1/2 & 1/2) and also added 1 tsp. black pepper.  Based on other reviews, I added about 2 cloves minced garlic with the butter.  It was a little bit salty & the appearance was somewhat similar to gravy so I think that I'll omit the broth next time and gently simmer the sauce, covered, so that it doesn't reduce (unsalted butter would help w/the saltiness, as well).  I topped each serving with some grated pecorino romano and toasted hazel nuts.  Thanks for the submission!

I thought this was awesome.  I added lot's of garlic and about 1 lb. of shrimp.  It's so versatile, just about anything would work!  The lemon and lime zest really make it light and refreshing seeing there's so much butter and cream...oh well, guess my diet starts tommorrow! :)

I was anxious to try this after reading the reviews..and yes this was fairly quick to put together, but I wasn't too excited about the taste.  I used chicken broth in lieu of the beef and added some sauteed red bell peppers, yellow squash and fresh spinach, which I cut into match-strips.  I only used the lemon juice and a little bit of the rind..which gave it plenty of tartness. I sprinkled a hefty dose of parmesan cheese on each serving and paired this with a focaccia bread found on this site. Not sure if I'll attempt this one again, but it was a nice alternative to the tomato based sauces that are so common at my place.  Thanks.

Great flavour!  I let this reduce by half and it was still quite thin to use as a pasta sauce but it was delicious on broccoli, potatoes and a lemon-parmesan chicken!  Thicker would have been better, but I will make it again.

I used 3 tbsp. butter and 1 tbsp. EVOO, fat-free half-n-half, omitted the lime zest (I didn't have any), and used low-sodium organic chicken broth. For the noodles, I used half the amount of noodles and used Hungry Girl's shirataki noodles (tofu noodles) and sauteed garlic, onion, zucchini and red pepper in the butter/EVOO in place of the other half of pasta I didn't use before adding the remaining ingredients. I also added 1/2 c. fresh parmesan right before serving. My kids and I thought this was fabulous but my husband didn't care for the noodles. If you aren't watching your calorie/carb intake, using a good whole wheat pasta would be excellent in this. He remarked on that the sauce was really good, just didn't care for the noodles. At the last minute, I folded my broccoli into my portion of pasta/sauce/noodles and was glad I did. Gosh, it was SO good. NOTE: If you use the shirataki noodles, make sure to rinse them really well before using them in this dish.

Good basic sauce. Sauce was on the thin side, even after reducing for a period of time.

The finished product of the written recipe was too bland for me, so I did some tweaking. This sauce will only be as good as your broth, so I'd recommend using chicken or beef stock. I made the recipe as written but used chicken stock instead of beef broth and all lemon zest. It was good, but was very mild in flavor and not enough lemon taste. I increased the zest and juice to taste and next time will probably thicken it slightly. I really like the idea though and will definitely be making this again with more "tweaks". :)

I have been to an expensive local restaurant and have had a very similar dish a few times so I thought I would try to recreate it.  I was pretty sure he used cream, broth, butter and lemon juice so did an ingredient search on Allrecipes and found this!  It is pretty much exactly what I was looking for: creamy, rich, tart, delicious!  I made this with some fresh basil & parsley from the garden along with red, orange and yellow peppers, artichoke hearts, red and spanish onions and carrots.  I reduced it down and it was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe, I'm going to keep tweaking this one.

Very good. I omit the zest and use chicken broth instead of beef. I also like to add artichokes and capers with the pasta.

This recipe was fabulous. I used half and half instead of the cream, and lemon pepper because I didn't have any lemon juice on hand. I also added parmesan cheese with some cooked carrots and broccoli. My boyfriend LOVED it!

This was AWESOME! Naturally I made a few changes based on what I had on hand...I used low fat milk instead of cream...I made a roux to thicken (melted the butter, then added 4T flour, cooked few minutes, then added milk,etc)  I used chicken broth instead of beef.   This was so easy and quick to make, so I recommend starting your noodles first, I forgot and the sauce was cold by the time the noodles were done.  I thought the lemon taste was great, very light, would be good with more lemon juice too! This would go great with seafood and chicken! Thanks for the recipe! This is the best sauce from scratch I've ever made! Can't wait to make it again!

I made a few minor changes to this recipe, but all-in-all it was excellent.  I used chicken broth, and doubled the lemon zest in place of the lime zest (I didn't have a lime).  We had it over pasta with chickn, and red and yellow peppers.  It was very good!

Really good! I did make a few sustitutions. I used low-fat margarine instead of butter, fat-free evaporated milk (didn't have heavy cream), and vegetable broth instead of beef. It turned out really yummy!

Very good, but I made some changes. First, I sauted 1 small minced yellow onion with about 1/4 cup of white wine, and a few tblsp butter. I added the remaining ingredients (excluding the lime. Didn't have one) Finally, I put 2 chicken breast in a casserole dish, and I poured the sauce over the top. I toped it with some grated monteray jack cheese, and baked it at 350 for about 25-30 mins. I served it over some fettucini noodles tossed with butter and lemon pepper. Soooo good! My boyfried LOVED it. So did I actually :)

This was really yummy!  I made half the recipe and only used lemon zest.  I'll save off lime zest the next time I have a lime just for this recipe!  Loved it!

I have this sauce on the stove as I type this.  I didn't want to use the lemon juice, as my mom taught me when I first started cooking that if you don't have buttermilk on hand to just add lemon juice to your cream or milk...so with that being said, I didn't want a "buttermilk" sauce on my pasta, so what I did was I melted my butter on med-low, added 2 Tablespoons of lemon grass herb blend (you can find the tubes next to the fresh herbs at your local produce section of the grocery store), and about 1 tsp lemon pepper, and I added a chicken bouillon cube to my cream.  Came out PERFECT, nice, subtle lemon taste.

I melted the 4T butter then added 1/4 C flour and made a roux to which I added 1 C skim milk.  Once it had thickened I added 1 C Chicken broth, 3 T Lemon Juice and about 1 t lemon zest.  I let it cook down for about 30 min.  So good!

DE-LISH! Although I used chicken broth instead and added some cooked chicken cubes to it. My family also likes a "little kick" to our dinner so i added some red pepper flakes to it the sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes before adding the chicken and tossing the pasta.

YUMMY! I was in love with it. I made the mistake of adding a bit of flour to cream to thicken it up, but I regretted doing it. Next time I make this Ill be following the directions EXACTLY. NOTHING needs to be changed. I made this recipe with angel hair pasta with grilled chicken and topped of with bacon crumbles and it was delicious! So glad I found this recipe!

Super yummy and perfect with the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan recipe! The only thing I did different is I left out the heavy whipping cream and used Evaporated Milk to make it a little healthier. I did have to add some cornstarch to make the sauce thicker (make sure to mix the cornstarch with cold water)  I also left out the lime zest. I topped with capers. It was so yummy and we will definantly make this again!

This is a WONDERFUL sauce!! I made it for Trader Joe's Lemon and Pepper Pappardelle and it was great! I didn't have beef broth so I substituted it with chicken broth.  I also added chopped asparagus that I marinated in lemon juice and then roasted in the oven for a bit with some olive oil. Great meal that  my family asks for again and again! Thank you!

Wow!  This is just so unexpectedly delicious and versatile!  I used it with lemon chicken pasta purses, along with crab cakes one time, and another time with breaded tilapia and the same pasta.  Just let the sauce cool a bit before adding the lemon juice, or it gets a little clumpy looking.  Also, I didn't have a lime, but just doubled up on the lemon juice and it was still awesome! This is a keeper!

Very good simple recipe, a nice change from our normal macaroni & cheese or alfredo side dish recipes we use for our picky kids. Used chicken broth instead of beef, added more lemon juice to compensate for the lemon and lime zest that we did not have on hand. Also added parmesan just at the end to thicken up a bit. Thanks for sharing, Holly!

Found this not to our liking with beef broth. Substituted chicken broth and it was phenomenal. We serve it with tortellini and it's great. Sometimes needs thickening with some whisked-in cornstarch.

Very very good sauce. My husband is greek and loves lemon as do I. I added lots more lemon juice and zest. I did not have the beef broth so I used chicken instead. I think we have a winner. Thanks Holly

This recipe was terrific.  I was looking for a pasta dish to serve with some lemon tarragon chicken breasts I had bought and this really came in as a winner.  We added a touch of garlic, some parsley, green pepper, mushrooms and some parmesean cheese along with the chicken and it made quite a meal.  The lemon sauce alone was pretty tasty.  (We sampled in between additions!)  Thanks for a good recipe!

I liked it, but I found it to be not lemony enough.  I did not include the lime (I thought that might be weird), but I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice.  Will keep, but will adjust the amount of lemon in the future.

I did not like this sauce at all. There was WAY too much butter in it. It never thickened and got creamy, just greasy and runny. I tried to reduce the sauce enough to at least make it a little thicker and it made it worse; it was pretty much 1/2 butter 1/2 cream/broth with a lemony flavor. Bleh. I followed the instructions exactly except I used lemon zest instead of lime, but that wouldn't change the consistency, just the flavor. I fear for trying it again but who knows.

Great sauce, although next time I'll have to measure the lemon juice because it could have used more.  (I just squeezed a lemon, but it may not have been enough)  I also added mushrooms, asparagus, salt and pepper.  Everyone ate it up!

This recipe was amazing! I added a little corn starch and water to thicken it a little bit and it turned our grate. I put it over lemon chicken and pasta, not only did it make our taste buds dance but it actually made my boyfriend dance.

This was a good recipe but I had to tweek it a bit.  The sauce needed more zip for us, so I added 4 tbls. of lemon juice instead of 2. It was too thin to cling to the pasta so I added 1 tsp. of corn starch.  Like others I used the chicken broth.  The second time I made it I added large cooked shrimp and 3 cups of fresh spinach leaves and then turned of the heat.  I let it sit long enough for the spinach and shrimp to warm through and wow, what a hit!  My family loved the tart flavor it gave the shrimp and spinach.  It's a great base recipe. Thanks

I think this recipe is AWESOME. I did not use the zest and the lemon taste was great. I added a little more lemon cause I like the taste but just keep trying the sauce while cooking and get it to however strong you like it. I also add Lemon Pepper to this and everyone in this house always LOVES it!!!

To those who rated this recipe so low.. I think a lot of people do not taste their dish as they are cooking. You need to continue to taste it and correct it wherever necessary.

ENJOY! and thanks for this recipe!!!!!

Good recipe.  A touch on the rich side but was still enjoyed by everyone. I too added salad shrimp, chopped red and green bell peppers and some fresh, sliced mushrooms.  I also omitted both lemon/lime zest since the lemon juice did the trick for me. Beware, one bowl of this dish could easily wreck your diet! Thanks Holly.

This tasted great!  Everyone loved it.  My husband said he thinks this is the best thing I've ever made!  The sauce was pretty thin so I mixed some milk and corn starch/flour and added that to help thicken it.  It still never got very thick but coated the pasta good enough.  I used chicken broth and put chunks of chicken in it.  I also just doubled the lemon zest because I didn't have a lime and added extra lemon juice.  I will make this again!

This recipe was delicious.  A creamy-fresh tasting sauce that paired great with fettuccine.  I also prepared Royal Red Shrimp--peeled, deveined, and seasoned with Old Bay seasoning and a Texan seasoning blend named Chupacabra.   Probably any Cajun type seasoned salt will work.   In a cast iron skillet, I added a tablespoon of oil and two tablespoons of butter, heated and added shrimp.  Cooked shrimp on one side until lightly caramelized and flipped...turned heat off and let the shrimp finish cooking until desired doneness.  

This was a wonderful meal which deserves permanent status in our meal rotation.  Nice enough for company, yet easy enough for a quick-unplanned dinner.

good base to have as is or get creative with. I didn't have lime but had everything else. I added garlic powder to the cream sauce and sauteed an orange bell pepper, zucchini, garlic, frozen cauliflower, and a parsnip. S/p, lemon juice/zest and it was a hit !Thanks for the recipe!

Finally made this after having it saved for months.  This was so simple to make and was yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added several chopped cloves of garlic and used 1/2 of the cream and 1/2 skim milk.  I did let it simmer and reduce but it doesn't get thick, that is the only draw back (of course it may be bc i used skim milk with the cream.  The zest is really important as it adds a POP of citrus flavor.  Added shrimp and served over linguine!

I like this recipe to use with pasta as a side dish.  I just use some lemon juice (no zest) and some garlic since I have those on hand all the time.

Yummm! We made this sauce to go with a pasta & broccoli side dish that accompanied our Valentine's meal of scallops and crab legs. The lemon flavor complemented the seafood SO well and it went great with the Beringer Chenin Blanc we had with dinner. The sauce was pretty runny, but after reading reviews, I now know that I did not let it simmer long enough (I'm still a beginner cook and have never made this kind of sauce before!). But it tasted great and that's all that mattered.  Can't wait to make this again, next time with chicken!

The BF and I loved this. I paired it with Garlic Lemon Doubled Stuffed Chicken also on this site. They worked wonderful together. Not so healthy, but oh so good. I used chicken broth instead of beef.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I added was a teaspoon or so of sugar. I teamed this with the "Garlic-Lemon Double Stuffed Chicken" recipe also from this site. I nested the chicken on the pasta topped with the sauce and plated it with steamed broccoli/carrot vegi combo. It looked great and tasted better!

I was not impressed. Made to the recipe I didn't like it at all, though my husband thought that it had "potential". We added 2 tbsp of flour (because it was too runny) and some milk to reduce the overpowering lemon. I then added some mushrooms and tomatos and simmered for about 20 minutes. It was eatable and my husband and father in law thought it was good. We will add garlic and some other spices to make it better next time. It is a good base, but not a finished product at all.

The flavor of this sauce was quite good, although I doubled the amount of lemon. I was not happy with the consistency. It had the thickness of water. Maybe melting the butter first and making a roux before adding anything else would give it a nice thickness.

Made this without the lemon or lime zest, and with chicken stock instead of beef stock. Easy and very good.

I tried this recipe after having something similar at a restaurant.  It became an immediate favorite of ours and so easy too.  I used more juice than what is called for.  I used the juice of a whole lemon and some juice from the lime.  To go with the pasta, we fried some fish dipped in flour and salt then put a little of the sauce on the fish.  The lemon/lime taste goes great with fish.  We also sprinkled some capers on the pasta which adds some color and the taste of the capers goes great with this sauce.

This was pretty good, but not great. If I were to make it again, I'd sub. chicken stock for the beef broth. The beef was just too strong of a flavor with the lemon.

This sauce is FABULICIOUS! My sister and I are both pregnant and we couldn't decide on a shared dinner idea. I am so glad we stumbled across this recipe. Both of our families LOVED it. We served this with baked lemon pepper chicken and topped each serving with mozzarella, diced tomatoes, green onions and a lemon slice.

This sauce is lovely. Tossed it with grilled chicken, brocolli, and penne pasta. Only change I made is I added more lemon zest because I didn't have a lime handy.

I loved the aroma of this sauce while it was simmering.  I imagined it to be much thicker but was pleasantly surprised how great it tasted with the spinach/ricotta tortellini I cooked.  I didn't have lime so ommitted that, but it was still fantastic!

This sauce was GREAT!  I made some modifications.  I added mushrooms and capers after the butter and waited until they were cooked, then I added whipped cream and broth.  It turned out DELICIOUS!  If you like the lemony butter flavor, this recipe is for you.  I served it with chicken piccata.  I had no left overs!

We liked it, but didn't love it. Tasted better when we added a little lemon pepper. As the pasta cooled, the sauce tasted more and more creamy, until it was a little too overwhelming.

Wonderful!  I love the lemony flavor.  I had to change some things only because I didn't have everything on hand.  No heavy cream; instead I used 1/2 & 1/2 and chicken instead of beef broth.(Not sure if I would have liked it as well with the beef broth.)My lemon & lime zest was past their prime so I used extra lemon juice & lime juice.  As another suggested, threw in some lemonpepper also.  Will make again.

Made this form my mom and sister.  Mom loved it, sister liked it but, said it was a little to lemony for here taste.  The basic sauce minus lemon is a great starter to add a million other things to.  I wondered about the beef broth over-powering the taste but, it didn't.

I tried this recipe as is and was very disappointed.  There was only a hint of lemon flavor which could have been achieved by adding just lemon juice in with the cooked pasta.  There are plenty of better recipies out there that are a lot healthier.

I usually do not like to exaggerate, but this was so good, words can hardly describe it. I thought the combination of lemon and cream would be tasting weird, but I was pleasantly surprised. I steamed some broccoli and tossed with the pasta as was suggested by another reviewer and it was absolutely devine. There is only one alteration that I would make, and that is: you can leave out the butter and just simmer the cream and the broth. It is absolutely delicious. When I wanted to log on to read the recipe the system was down so I had to remember the recipe from the top of my head and I only remembered the cream and the broth and the lemon juice and zest. So leave out the butter, otherwise it might be too greasy. Otherwise it was simply perfect. Don't forget the broccoli!

I love this!  I use this recipe all of the time. I will sometimes add a couple crushed cloves of garlic to the original simmer.  I also like to mix some capers and roma tomatoes into the pasta at serving. (Bacon and mushrooms are also nice.)

Very very good.  I was skeptical that beef broth would taste right, but it's really very good.  Don't be afraid to use it, because it doesn't overpower the flavor.  I agree that a whole lemon (zest and juice) works well, and I even used lemon pepper to pep up the flavor.  Marinated artichoke hearts complemented the lemon sauce very well.

I left out the lime zest because I was feeling especially lazy.  THIS WAS DELICIOUS !! Go to the store now,  get your ingredients, add some broccoli to make yourself feel less guilty about all the fat and MAKE THIS DISH !

This is a great base recipe.  I made some changes and will make more changes next time I make it.  I used white wine instead of broth.  Didn't use any lime, just plenty of lemon.  For us it needs a little something more.  I will use some garlic and parmesan next time.  This went well with salmon and I will be making it again with the changes.  Thanks!

I really loved the flavor of this sauce but I did have a hard time getting it to thicken, or reduce. I guess I'll just have to be a bit more patient next time! I did change the recipe by using chicken broth instead of beef broth. Also, I did not use lime zest (just lemon), and I did add in about half a cup of grated romano cheese to the sauce about 3 minutes before I took it off the stove. I served this sauce over tri-color rotini tossed with fresh steamed broccoli. It had a great lemon flavor.

This is a quick and easy meal, however not something I would make on a regular basis because it is way fattening and tastes very rich. Definitely way more creamy than citrusy. I felt a little sick after eating it. A little bit definitely goes a long was with this dish!

This is delicious, but a little bland.  Great with strong meat flavors.  I served it with the Basil Shrimp from this site, and it was perfect, because the shrimp had a very strong flavor.

I substituted vegetable broth instead of beef broth and also added about 3x's the amount of lemon juice and zest.  I omitted the lime.

I think this would go GREAT with some steamed broccoli either separately or added to the pasta (preferably fettucini).

This was okay, but it needed a lot of doctoring. I ended up adding lots of extra things, such as extra lemon, pepper, parsley, parmesan cheese, and garlic to make it more flavorful. I also started with a roux based on other reviews stating it was too runny even after reducing it. It turned out decent however, it took a lot to make it taste like anything other than cream.

Served the noodles with meatballs - my husband said the meatballs saved the dish. I did use milk with cornstarch, since I did not have half and half, as someone else suggested. Perhaps I'll try it with half and half next time.

This is by far the best lemon pasta sauce I have found. It can e easily modified to suit the style of meal, or as is, and is still great. I've used it many times, and is a family favorite.

I made this tonight and used it with fresh fettucini pasta and zucchini "pasta" which I made with a peeler. I modified the sauce- didn't use any broth at all or lime. I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup skim milk (bc I ran out of heavy cream only reason! lol) and a whole stick of butter, plus caramelized onions and fresh garlic and green onions. I used the zest and juice from one whole lemon. The sauce wasn't very thick but just thick enough, I was happy with it but if I had the whole cup of HC I would use it. and over shrimp too, and with cut up roma tomatoes (I didn't have any). The lemon flavor was perfect- you could taste it but not tart at all nor too overpowering. Baby bear!!!

This was easy and so yummy!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written and at the first bite my husband and I were a bit overwhelmed by the citrus flavor but as the bites went on it was delicious.  I will try this again and try to lighten it up with more broth, half and half and and less butter.  It is great as written!

I really love this recipe, I use chicken broth instead of beef broth and I add extra lemon (but make sure whoever is going to eat it really loves lemon).  I serve this over broccoli OR I make basil fettucini, spoon the lemon pasta sauce over it, and top with the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan (made per the recipe on allrecipes except I use herbs de provence instead of the other spices)

Nice subtle flavor, family loved it. I did add one more Tbs lemon juice. Served as a main dish with  diced grilled chicken and capers and fresh grated romano cheese.

This tasted like it should belong in a dessert, not a pasta dish. It is also really fatty.

This was delicious. I sauted chicken breast chunks with fresh mushrooms in a little olive oil and added it to the sauce (after draining it really good). I also stirred in 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese to thicken it a little more. Delicious!

Uh, sorry but I don't know what all the rave was about for this recipe...I was not that impressed. It tasted bland and just not what I expected...maybe I did it wrong. I didn't use the zest, but the other reviews said it was un-necessary. Oh well, moving on...

Excellent recipe! I used chicken bouillon instead of the beef broth and didn't add the lemon or lime rinds and everybody loved it at home. Even my hard-to-please 14 year old liked it.

I chose this sauce because I wanted a white sauce without cheese.  I avoid cheese because it is a migraine trigger.  This was easy to make.  Very runny, though.  I like to cook one day and eat leftovers the next.  I appreciated the review that said the leftovers didn't reheat well.  I just made the sauce two days in a row and appreciated its simplicity.  For taste it was ok.  Not a whole lot of flavor.  My husband said he really liked it.  I served it with Al Dente brand spinach pasta and broccoli flowerets.

I have to say I first read the ingredients and was a little iffy about the taste, but made it anyway. My whole family loved it, even my 4 year old. Will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was okay but definitely not great.  Way too rich and not worth all the fat in my opinion.  Plus, I had to add alot of herbs and seasonings to bring out more flavor.  Wont make again.

Very good, lighter pasta dish. I added 2 Tbsp. capers to the sauce. Sauteed shrimp with butter and garlic and added to the pasta. If you let the sauce sit for a while after cooking, it will thicken up. Will definately make again.

I liked the flavor, but it was far too thin and watery.  This is probably my fault, as I did not use the proper vegan substitute for the whipping cream; I just used soymilk.  Silly me.  I will probably make again using a different subtitution.  I also added mushrooms, which made it a meal for me.

Very good!  I made it with the whipping cream but next time I would try light half & half to cut down on the fat.  I added grilled turkey fillets and peas.  Makes quite a bit of sauce.

I didn't measure the lemon juice or zest or the lime zest. I just grated as much zest as I could off of each and squeezed the juice from half the lemon. I was so apprehensive about the combination of the beef with the citrus, but was so intrigued, I decided to give it a go. So glad I did! This was very good and went well with baked parmesan chicken.  Everyone liked it very much.

Very good recipe! I had a similar sauce in a nice Italian restaurant & have been wanting to duplicate it, but this one surpassed it! I also added a few extras to make it more of a main dish, poached chicken, steamed asparagus & some sun dried tomatoes, but I did not adjust anything in the original recipe.  This ones a winner! Thanks, Holly!

I'm a real citrus addict, and I was a little skeptical of this recipe having enough "zing" for my tastebuds... but it did!  Light and refreshing taste, but still creamy and soothing.  I used linguine and served it with a green salad.  The only adjustment I made was to add a couple grinds of black pepper and 1/4 tsp of dried thyme.  It took it right to the next level, wonderful!

OKAY-this sauce was pretty easy to make and tasted pretty good, it doesn't mix well so you kind of have a top layer of oil and a bottom layer of sauce. other then that it was okay

I have been looking for a white cream sauce with great flavor.  I love the hint of lemon and lime.  Wonderful on pasta and chicken, this one hits the spot!  Thanks for sharing.
