Tops!  The cream and Swiss cheeses and the cayenne really add flavor to these.  I put the cream cheese in the bottom of a mixing bowl, mixed together the eggs, salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper and about 2T Louisiana Hot Sauce and beat this into the cream cheese.  Tossed the grated potatoes (2.5 Large, grated on large holes in box grater and soaked up moisture with paper towels) with the Swiss cheese and 1/2 medium very thinly sliced onion, sprinkling on the flour as I tossed the whole mixture.  Made a judgement call on the margarine and oil and fried them in batches approx 3 min/side.  Served them with a dollop of sour cream, green salad and wine chorizo that had been simmering in dark ale.  Hello!  Will definitely do this again.

Awesome, even my kids love these.  I usually double the cheese.  You can shred the potatoes in advance and keep them in a bowl of water in the fridge until you are ready.  To get all the water out of the potatoes I run them through the salad spinner!

These were great! I did do half swiss and half cheddar instead of all swiss, but still fantastic. Would have been super with a little sour cream and dill too. I would suggest cutting down on the amout of butter and oild they are fried in - too much.

Good pancakes, for 16 people. 8 1/2 cups of potato. 4 eggs.1/4 cup of  flour. But, had I no Swiss cheese. So I  used 2 slices  of cheddar cheese, saute mushrooms & onions  in butter,finely chopped.About  half cup. Minced  garlic about 2 table spoons. Used red & white onions mixed~ 1/4 cup. Salt & pepper to taste. I Fallowed  the  rest of the recipe.  Froze  half of them  for a later date.

These were very tasty, although I did adjust the recipe just a tad, based on what I had on hand. I used chive and onion cream cheese and cheddar instead of swiss. I just eyeballed the onion and cheese, so I probably ended up using double of each. I made a sauce of sour cream, blue cheese dressing, and horseradish to serve on top, which complimented them nicely.

These were OK. I'll use more onion if I make this again. On their own they're a little bland, but if you serve them with herbed and spiced sour cream they are good.

This was awesome. I didn't have swiss, so I used colby cheese. Great flavor.

It's the last day of Hanukkah. I've made traditional potato pancakes (latkes) twice, and I was looking for something a bit different for lunch. These are the perfect latkes with a twist. I added more cheese, doubled the spices, and fried only in oil, not butter. Wow!!

These turned out really good. I love the cream cheese idea in the mix. That really makes a difference in the texture and taste. I will make this again. Next time I will add more seasonings. Only because I like over seasoned food, especially fried foods.

These were tasty, though I was hoping for a bit more in the flavor department. I halved the recipe just to try them and used refrigerated hash browns in place of fresh. I couldn't taste the swiss as much as I wanted to, and I used more than called for. I think I would still make these again, but adjust for more spice, add more cheese and onion. They were very nice and crispy, just wish they were more flavorful. Thanks for sharing. :)

Wonderful recipe!!  Used smoked gouda instead of the swiss because my family loves it.  But would be great with the swiss or most any other cheese

I don't see how this recipe could rate a 5 star.  It wasn't awful, it just wasn't great, either.  Sort of ho-hum, somewhere in the middle.  I cut the recipe in half and followed the instructions exactly except I added a dash of garlic powder.  It was hard to turn them because they were pretty gooey and so I let them crisp up well before turning them.  Hubby said they were okay but didn't have much flavor.  We couldn't even tell there was cream cheese or swiss cheese in it.  I was going to be generous and give it a 3 star but Hubby said he wouldn't give it more than a 2 - so that's how I came up with the 2 stars.  Probably won't be making these again.

Wonderful!  I had leftover Boursin cheese from Christmas, so I subbed that for cream cheese but otherwise followed the recipe (oh, except used jack cheese instead of swiss).  turned out lovely.  Be sure to use a slotted spoon and let your potatoes "drain" a bit before putting in frying pan.  If you like them crispy be sure to spread them out in the pan cook at least 3 minutes a side.  I fried an egg and topped the pancake with that and a lovely cream reduction sauce, some cubed ham and green onions.  HUGE hit at the breakfast table this morning!

This was the second half of my St. Patrick's Day meal - along with the Reuben Sandwich II from this website.  We really liked this recipe.  I had never had nor made potato pancakes before.  This is very easy to put together and we really enjoyed the flavors.  I had purple onion so that is what I used.  When I make these again, I will go a little heavier on the cayenne pepper.  I cooked on the griddle so I could make them all at once.  These also warmed up nicely the next day for lunch.  Thanks Ferne for sharing this recipe.

Made these with a salad of greens and it was a super quick weeknight meal.
