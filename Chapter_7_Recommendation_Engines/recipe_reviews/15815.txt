I chose this pie because I was trying to duplicate the one from Furr's. Nope- nothing like it. I wanted a butter chess pie, so this looked like it might work. It's not bad, just not what I was looking for. Too sticky sweet for me. But if that's what YOU are looking for, go for it!

Exactly what I expected, easy to make, and insanely yummy.  I used "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" from this site under it, and the combination is perfect.

It was super easy to make and it had a good taste but was a little heavy on the egg taste. Might try to make it with one less egg the next time.

I added a ripe banana to the egg mixture.   Different and delicious.

I tried this recipe, it was great!  I am from Tennesseee, chess pie is a traditional thing for our family.  I made a few for our men's ministry christmas dinner.  The next thing I knew the pastor was announcing how good they were to the whole congregation.  Lol
