I found by placing the eggs, sugar, cream cheese, sour cream and cottage cheese in the blender and blending it all together, then pouring it on the cooked noodles and adding pineapple chunks, and topping with the buttter and crumbs, it came out very creamy and easier to make.

Updated 9-30-2011:  Re topping modification below: Didn't have cornflakes so used NOT crushed rice crispies instead.  Wonderful and the topping looked interesting!!!!! See my photo.  Soaked 3/4 cup golden raisins for 20 min in warm 1/2 triple sec and 1/2 apple juice (liquids mixed and heated on 30 seconds in microwave) THEN made the pudding processed sugar free using 1/4 cup splenda and 1/4 cup Agave Syrup to replace white sugar.  No one could tell...I left part without topping for my diabetic mom.  Also, next time I will use one stick of butter melted in the noodles, not 6 tablespoons-I don't like tiny leftovers.  This is NOT a low fat dish-it is a treat...I'd rather have a small piece of something fabulous than a large piece of blah.
2004 review: 
This is the best Kugel recipe I've made or tasted!  I only changed a few things.   I used the whole 8 oz package of cream cheese (I didn't want that extra 1/4 sitting around for me to eat.) I added 1/2 cup of raisins to the noodle mixture after I soaked them in VERY HOT water for about 15 minutes. I changed the topping to:  1.5 cups crushed cornflakes mixed with 1 stick (1/2 cup) of melted butter and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. I sprinkled that on top and then I mixed 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon with 1/8 cup of white sugar and sprinkled that on last before baking. 
It was great the next day too!!! Eat cold or warm, but best warmed.

This was fantastic. I actually double the topping to make it go across the whole dish, and one important thing...make sure you cover the dish as it's baking! This is so moist and yummy.

Follow up on topping quantity concerns:  Though the recipe calls for a 9 x 13 dish, I've always made it in my glass souffle dish.  With less top surface area, less topping is required.  And when it's cold, it slices into a beautiful wedge shape too!

Ann - thanks for the great recipe! I changed it a bit by adding non-fat cream cheese, non-fat sour cream, and non-fat cottage cheese along with non-fat egg noodles, and your recipe held up well! I then added pecans, raisins, and cinnamon. My party loved it!

First time I've ever made Kugel. I saw it in an old cookbook, one that I couldn't find again, so searched it out on allrecipes. Ann's sounded good.  I made as she directs, except I did add one cup of golden raisins & addes cinnamom to the topping, which I doubled, as suggested from other reviews.   Result:  this was delicious, rich & loved by all.  I will use again & again for special occasions. Thanks  :)

Great recipe... I have been searching for a great kugel that could stand up to the one my mom and i made growing up from my step fathers jewish cook book... This is the closest recipe i have been able to find... Decided to make it when after years of not having it it was all i could think about... It even was on several tv shows i watched!  Weird... Anyway made it for the inlaws who thought i was crazy and they loved it... For anyone with complaints of sweetness it is fine to omit or cut back on the sugar topping... We only used graham crackers growing up... Recipes dont have to be set in stone play around for your or your families likes and dislikes... Happy cooking!

Ok.. I NEVER EVER give reviews on anything, but I am compelled to write a review for this kugel... I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of adding raisins and making more graham cracker topping) and brought this to my friends house for Yom Kippur... well, it was a big hit..In fact, the host's mom (who has a very discerning taste)couldnt stop raving about it.. There was nothing left, which made me happy..I will definately make this again for the next special occaasion. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this for my husband for Hanukkah and he absolutely loved it.  I'm usually not a fan of low-fat desserts (if you're going to have dessert, have dessert!), but I made the following substitutions based on what I had and it was still delicious: non-fat cottage cheese, low-fat sour cream, 4 ounces of cream cheese, one less egg, and 4 tablespoons of butter in the kugel, and 2 tablespoons of butter in the topping (which made it more crumbly and easy to sprinkle).  With all the dairy and eggs, it didn't lack at all in richness.

Wow, I've never received such rave reviews from Kugel before.  Everyone loved it.  Even my skinny friend who eats like a bird stuffed herself with it until she was sick.  Will miracles never cease?  (It is Haunukkah after all!)  It was wonderful and creamy and rich, as promised.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  This is definitely the best kugel ever.  Must try.

This is insanely delicious. For the past 12 plus years, I have tried customizing a recipe handed down for generations on my husbands side. This year, I lost that recipe and looked on this sight for a replacement. I tried this one. It was met with RAVE reviews from my husband. This is delicious. Best Kugel he says!

Passover is coming soon, so "Kugel for 60, coming right up!"  This is the best kugel recipe I have found.  It is sweeter than most I have tasted.  My kids want the leftovers for breakfast.

I made this for all my friends for Chanukah in Jerusalem.  Everyone said this was the best kugel they have ever had!  The only change I made was to add one Tbs. of cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very rich and moist!  I added raisins and used thin noodles instead of thick.  Also took another person's tip to put all the sauce stuff in the blender and blend it all at once, turned out fine and was much more simple.  We will be making this one again!

This recipe is great. I tweaked it a bit, however, I also used all low fat ingredients including the noodles. But I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to step 2 and sprinkled Cinnamon sugar to the final step before baking. Fantastic.

I made this last night for my family's break the fast, and it was a huge hit.  This was as good as any other kugel that I have ever had.  1/3 cup ended up being two whole graham crackers crumbled.  Next time will definitely use three since the toppings became sparse when it was cut and served.  Thanks for a great recipe, Ann!

I have made this dish three times - twice as is and once yolk-free.  It is such a hit.  In all, I've served it to over 30 people and have yet to find someone who doesn't like it.  I double the topping each time and add brown sugar and cinnamon to the crumble to give it an added kick.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Too much cottage cheese. Next time I will try halving it. I will also add fruit. I added lots of cinnamon, which I think it needed.

Could be a main dish, with all the protein (eggs & cheese) or a dessert (mildly sweet). But I'm not sure how this would be considered a side dish?!

Never made Kugel before. Made this recipe times 9.  I attempted to follow it to the letter, but I think I messed up some numbers.  (probably too little cottage cheese; maybe too much cream cheese)  Stirring, esp. folding in 54 whipped egg whites was challenging - tranferred between bowls to thoroughly mix.  Poured into 3 church baking pans & refrigerated overnight.  Warmed to room temp & baked as directed.  Turned out delicious.  Thanks, Ann!

Really great tasting!  Light, and not too mushy/cheesy or too sweet like some kugels.  I didn't try the graham cracker topping, but opted for the crumbled corn flakes and brown sugar and butter topping someone else suggested, which I really liked.  However, my corn flakes came out a little too hard for some reason.  Instead of a topping, I think I might opt for adding raisins or pineapple chunks next time, as this recipe could use just a hint of sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I have used this recipe numerous times at various synagogue events. EVERYONE loves it, and I am always asked for the recipe. Now, it is just kind of assumed that I will bring the kugel. I use low-fat cream cheese, sour cream, and cottage cheese, but keep the real butter. SO delicious!

I've only had kugel twice before - both times from Rein's Deli in Connecticut. I was looking for something fun and different for a dessert and I remembered it!  This recipe was a great starting point - I'm not sure if this is true to form but I did make a few modifications based on health/memory of the Rein's version:  Aside from greasing the pan I completely omitted the butter.  Also used low fat sm. curd cottage cheese, sour cream and used neufchatel/lowfat cream cheese.  I added 3/4 cup golden raisins + about 1/2 t cinnamon.  Also used corn flakes in the crust instead of graham. Also did not bother separating the eggs and pretty much tossed all of the 'wet' ingredients into a bowl, mixed for 45 seconds and then poured it over the noodles & raisins. Then sprinkled topping - came out great!

Great!  Made it for a Hanukkah party and was nervous because I have never had it.  My Jewish friends said it was excellent!  I added 1tsp cinnamon and doubled the topping.  Separate the eggs while they are cold, but don't whip the whites until they are room temp.  Made a rather fluffy dish!  Yum!

I made this for our fathers day dessert and everyone really seemed to like it. I wish it was a bit creamier, but I solved that problem by serving it hot with a BIG scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. My only other suggestion would be to double the graham cracker topping. I felt like it needed more than what the recipe made.

I love this recipe!  I just changed a few things.  I put a small amount of the kugel on the bottom of the plate and then sprinkled warmed apricot preserves over it.  Then I put the rest of the kugle over that.  Instead of the grahm  crackers I used corn flakes.  I took this to an AA meeting and it was a hit.

My family are kugel experts, and they said this was the best kugel ever.  It's the perfect, fluffy consistency.  I should have made two of them!  It's hard to get the graham cracker crust even, but it probably takes practice.

I changed the recipe a bit because I like apples in kugel.  I cut down the sugar to about 1/2 C and the milk (I used 2%) to about 1 1/2 C to compensate for the sugar and liquid in the apples. I added 3 peeled apples sliced thin. This came out great.  I might cut down on the vanilla a little next time.  I also put this into two smaller  disposable containers so I could bring one to a friend.

This is one of those dishes that I remember my 'bubba' making when I was a child.  Probably that was a much simpler recipe and was parve -- no milk products.  Hard to compete with childhood memories but this tastes great!

I have been making noodle kugel for years and I am never thrilled with how it comes out- until this time!!!  I used medium egg noodles rather than the wide or broad ones and the bag was 12 ounces so I used the whole thing.  I should have just used the whole package 8oz of cream cheese it would have been easy and fine.  I was skeptical about whipping the eggs separately but the end result was great!  I used a 9x13 nonstick cake pan and sprayed with cooking spray.  I was thrilled with the results of this!  Usually my kugel is too crunchy on the top and it doesn't stay together... It sort of falls apart.  But I am happy to say this recipe produced perfect results!!!  This is coming from someone that considers themselves to be just an OK cook .  do not hesitate to make this recipe it was great!!!

I found that 8oz of noodles was not enough for a 9x13 inch pan. I used the whole 12 oz package . Also I am use to Kugel having cinnamon in it . I used 1 Tblsp in the mixture at the end. It would be good in the graham cracker topping too. To the topping I also added chopped pecans for some texture. I will make this again.

I ALWAYS use this recipe! Even when I don't make the measurements exact or beat the eggs seperately it still turns out GREAT!! I usually use the cornflake topping instead (that is just what my family prefers). When I asked my grandmother for her recipe that I grew up on in childhood, she answered something in yiddish that means "whatever you have on hand", so one kugel could have sour cream in it or not depending what you had in the fridge. SO, to have this great recipe on hand is extremely useful and wonderful :)

I found the kugel to be plain, but good. The topping is exceptional-though you will need more than 1/3 cup! I will try it with raisins and a bit more sugar next time.

Although this recipe took a few more steps than most (separating and beating the eggs), it was worth it.  Everyone enjoyed it.  It had a rich texture.  Be prepared...it is a little heavier than some other versions...but very yummy!  It got great reviews from the guests!

I'm not rating this becase I'm not sure it's fair to do it.  I would give it a three star.  I made it and no one in my family liked it.  Then again we are not Jewish and have never eaten kugel before.  We didn't like the noodles and pudding like texture together.  Although I was the only one who ate what was on my plate, I didn't go back for seconds. The toping was very good though.

Unbelievable!  Delicious!  A true traditional kugel! One of my dinner attendees asked me to make steamed broccoli because she is anti-starch.  She barely touched the broccoli and had FOUR pieces of the kugel.  I followed the recipe to a tee and found the texture of the topping a little difficult to work with (it was too wet to "sprinkle"), but my very picky audience didn't seem to mind.  This kugel will be a tradition from now on.

Finally the Kugel recipe I was looking for because I kept losing my mother-in-laws!  I too added a bit of cinnamon to it, and used corn flakes with cinnamon and sugar as the topping, for that's how my husband's mother makes it.

I made this kugel for a holiday potluck.  I followed the recipe fairly closely, but because I didn't have much time in the morning to prepare it, the night before I did some pre-preparation.  I separated the eggs and put the whites into a tupper and put it in the fridge.  I mixed all of the other internal ingredients except the noodles and put it away in another tupper until the next day.  I made up double toppings the night before as well.  The next day, I boiled the noodles and whipped the whites.  I folded in the premixed ingredients and then the noodles, and then poured into the prepared baking dish.  I spread around the topping and baked covered with aluminum foil for the first half hour and then uncovered for another half hour.  It came out beautifully (I've uploaded a picture).  It didn't go over well at the goy-intensive potluck, leaving me with a lot of leftovers.  I mostly attribute that to people being unwilling to try something new, but as for me, I thought it was very good.  However, I do think the filling could use more sugar.  It wasn't as sweet as kugels I've had before. When I got a bite with topping in it (which was very sweet), it was very good.  When I just had filling it seemed a little lacking.  I think the sugar in the filling should be increased to 1 cup.  If I make it again, I'm going to try that.

I had really high hopes for this dish.  I made kugel only once before (a few years ago) and I couldn't find my original recipe so I used this one.  Unfortunately, I modified it by using ricotta instead of cottage cheese, which must make a big difference...?  I'm not a fan of cottage cheese so I thought it would taste better with the ricotta, but it came out pretty dry and without a lot of flavor.  I will maybe try it again with cottage cheese and maybe include pineapple (like other reviewers) to add more flavor.  I'm bummed because it took a while to make and made a LOT of dirty dishes in the process.

I did what others suggested. I creamed it all together except the egg whites, I added the noodles then added the egg whites. I did not add all the sugar in the topping since the Graham cracker topping has enough sweet so halved the sugar in the topping and did make more to cover it. I also added raisins in a half of it. Creamy and delicious.

We had this for our family holiday gathering.  I made it as directed with the only adjustment being a doubling of the toping, as suggested by others.  It came out great.  It was lighter and fluffier than other Kugels my family has made.  It was a big hit with those who like kugel.  I will definitely make it again.

Really great recipe!  Easy to make too. My husband told me it took the blue ribbon over my mom's!  It's a very fluffy version, not the traditional brick of noodles.

I used this recipe as a base for my specialty "chocolate chip cannoli kugel" (will post later) for a contest at temple. I didn't win--but guess what did?  THIS recipe! So you know it must be good!

Made this as a side dish for Easter dinner. Followed recipe as it was written, just covered with foil while it cooked. Was a big hit with the family, wouldn't change anything.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing (although we didn't have graham crackers so I used crushed Crispix, which was fantastic). It makes more than the recipe indicates, which is good, because everybody loved it and wanted to take leftovers home. I think the real secret to the recipe is the egg whites, it makes the dish super light and not dense like a lot of kugel is.

Very good, light and fluffy. I followed the recipe exactly. The noodles turned out a lil dry, but not to bad.

The kugel was amazing.  Simple, fast, delicious!  Made it for Rosh Hashana family dinner, and people were licking their plates.  There were no leftovers...  I got tons of compliments.  Can't believe how easy this was!  I doubled the topping ingredients.  Do not overmix!  It was so light, just divine.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!  Will make again, and again, and again!!

I looked at this recipe and decided to try it for my daughter's birthday party!!!  It was the first time I made kugel from scratch.  WOW!!!!  It got incredible reviews from all of our guests.  I basically doubled the recipe.  I did more than double the butter and cream cheese.  I didn't use the sour cream or the cottage cheese.  I did everything else.  I put it in two 13x9 pans and baked as directed.  I chilled overnight and cut into squares for serving on the buffet.  It was AMAZING!!!!  It will now be my go to kugel recipe.  Thanks!!!!

Love Love LOVED this recipe! I doubled it and made two and my family ate the entire first dish and we even dug into the second one. Leftovers are awesome and the crust added a nice sweetness to a neutral kugel. I will defiantly be making this one next Rosh Hashanah!

Was very disappointed, I've had much better kugel. I kept checking the recipe to see if I did something wrong.The texture is like sweetened mashed tofu with noodles in it.

Yet another Catholic girl trying to cook Jewish cuisine.    I made this for our annual Hannukah/Christmas party and my Jewish in-laws were very impressed.  I didn't change a thing with this recipe and found it very moist and delicious - still really good the next day.

This was delicious.  Though my mother and sister were skeptical to try it at first, after they did, and I did, we were all raving about it after trying it.  The taste is great and it has a nice, creamy consistency.  Even though it is traditionally a Jewish side dish, it tastes like dessert and is very filling.

Noodles with custard; the 2 flavors opposed each other; no melding. Perhaps another region of the country is using a thinner egg noodle not available here in the Midwest/Southwest.

I used 12 oz egg noodles instead of 8 oz and did not increased the sugar, came out little bland. Next time I'll add extra sugar to the mixture, matbe 3/4 c sugar in 12 oz egg noodles.

It took a bit longer to prepare and a bit shorter to bake. I should have mixed in my egg whites a bit better, but it was good and got good reviews from the others at the dinner.

I realized at the last minute (in process) that I didn't have cottage cheese, so I replaced it with ricotta. It turned out delicious, and my Jewish mother couldn't get over how good it was EVEN THOUGH it wasn't my grandmother's recipe. :)

Great recipe.  Husband was glad it didn't have raisins.  I was nervous it was missing cinnamon but it didn't need it.  Made exactly as stated. It's a keeper.

This was my first time making a kugel and I was very impressed by the results. The taste and texture were great! I would definitely make this again.

I  love this and I put a savory twist on it ,by omitting the 1/2cup sugar and added sautéed onion and crumbled cooked bacon and chopped spinach.

I made a savory version.  added chicken breast, chopped fresh spinach, cut the sugar to 1 tbs-ish, added a little dried chipolte pepper, and when it was all put together, drizzled a little dijon mustard on top, poured a little half and half in the corner so it wouldn't dry out/stick.  and on top instead of the graham crackers, did a mix of melted butter, bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Cranked up the oven to 400 and it was done in 1/2 hour.  it was an immense hit.  next time will add a little garlic and onion powder.  and if the kid that doesn't like mushrooms isn't home....i'll add mushrooms!  if you try it, don't leave out the dijon...it made it!

This came out great! I never made a Kugel myself and it tasted just like the one my Aunt makes- the way I remember!! I didn't have any graham cracker cookies, so i took some plain cookies and crushed those instead... Still great!

Amazing!  This was not only my first attempt at making a kugel, it was the first time EVER I actually liked a kugel!  Most kugels are so sweet it's like eating cookie dough.  This recipe is just ever so slightly sweet and way creamy and just simply good!  It was the dish with the most raves at our Hanukkah party. YUM!!!

I've never had kugel before and I thought that this was going to be creamy like mac n cheese but it ended up more like a souffle.  Good. Sweet. Just not what I was expecting. I will make it again though.

I made this for Passover and it was a great success with matzo meal in lieu of graham cracker.  Note, it is really easy to crumble it evenly on top if you refrigerate it over night.  If you need to refrigerate it (actually MUCH better than baking it immediately), I suggest keeping it in the bowl and not adding it to your dish.  Cover the bowl because some of the liquid will evaporate.

Absolutely delicious!  The best kugel I've ever had.  I, too, added the entire block of cream cheese and used a 12 oz bag of noodles (because that's what I had).  I imagine it would have been much richer (and therefore better tasting!) if I had used the right amount.  The only change I would make is to triple the topping.  It was the best part!

Incredible! So beautiful. It puffs up and makes a very nice presentation. I highly recommend - no changes necessary. Wish I had taken a photo before we dug in!

Just like grandma's! Delicious! Added some cinnamon sugar on top instead of the graham topping and 1/2 cup of raisons to the noodle mixture.

AWESOME RECIPE!!! I made this for Rosh Hashanah dinner and it was the hit of the night. There was another kugel from a Jewish deli and everyone said mine blew that one away!! I would make more topping next time, everything else was perfect. I will be making this for every holiday!!

The Kugel was delicious!  I followed another reviewers advice and reduced the butter in the topping to 2 tablespoons.  I think the Kugel tasted better warmed up the next day.

I found this recipe easy to make and very delicious.  I brought in for my co-workers and 2 of them asked for the recipe.  It is very good.  This was the first time I tried to make it.
