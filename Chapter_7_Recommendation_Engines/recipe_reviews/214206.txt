I have 4 kids who all have their own culinary opinions.  They all loved it as well as the husband and myself.  Next time I will try it boneless just because I was a little concerned someone might bite into a bone. I hope it doesn't alter the favor to much.  We loved it with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese, not a drop of sauce left!!

I wrapped these completely in bacon and browned them in the skillet for 4 min each side. (Disconnet smoke alarm) Simmered them for 1 hour in a combination of BARBQ sauce, Pineapple juice with chunks and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Flipped them after 30 minutes.  They smell great and I'm sure they will be.  They are.

These Were Yummy! However, I Think The Time Was Too Long, Because My Pork Chops Were Falling Apart, Eventhough I Set My Crok & Timer Correctly.. Other Than That, It Was A Good Dish.

This was great.  I followed the recipe, however cooked it for 5 hours.  They were deliciously tender and moist.  Everyone loved them!

I liked this more than I thought I was going to. Very zesty, bit of a kick from the chilli sauce but not enough to put anyone off. All the family liked it and I'll be doing it again. Not sure it needs the sugar though (my tomato chilli sauce had plenty in). I served it with stir-fried rice and peas.

Yummy! I used some homemade sweet chili sauce that I canned earlier this year.  The recipe turned out great. I think next time i will use some oriental style chili sauce and add more pineapple chunks. Good keeper recipe.

Sub'ed in Ellenmel's chili sauce recipe from this site, had no pineapple and these still came out quite good. Not so heart healthy so I will be scrolling thru the rev.s to see if anyone's made an adaption with the bacon.  They cooked in 3 hours on low (my Rival crockpot runs hot).

These were decent, the pork chops were really tender, but the sauce wasn't amazing.  I doubt we'll make them again.  Served with white rice and sweet peas.

Very flavorful ... my only suggestion would be to reduce cooking time slightly ....they were very tender but just a tiny bit dry after the full 6 hours,  and I used thick boneless chops  ... But the kids liked it ,  and my husband and I LOVED it!

This really was great, and so easy. I only wrapped each piece of pork in one bacon slice. My only comment is that I think that lean cuts like pork chops get dry in the slow cooker, so I may just try this one in my oven, or on a day when it wouldn't have to stay in there so long. But, the flavor was great, and it really did make the meat tender if a bit dry. Thanks for sharing!

Had to break the toothpicks in half and soak them in water so they wouldn't catch fire, but other than that, this dish is a winner.

Followed directions exactly but family was underwhelmed with this dish.  Hubby said it was quite bland, but very tender.  Not a keeper dish for my carnivores.

turned out really good! I used boneless porkloin and it took about 4 hrs. on low. This was my first time using the broiler so I was a little nervous, next time I would like the bacon to become a little more crispy before I put it in the crockpot.

You had me at Bacon wrapped pork chops. The only thing I changed was the chili sauce. That could mean anything! I used ketchup with some Sriracha and Aji instead. The pork was so tender! This one will definitely be added to the rotation.

Very good!  After reading a couple reviews, I cooked it for less time.  I also browned them in a frying pan on the stovetop as opposed to broiling.  Five center cut pork chops, just less than 5 hours in the crock.  Done perfectly, moist and tender.  I also added 1/2 chopped jalapeno.  Very tasty, very easy.

I had high hopes that this recipe would be my "go-to" recipe for pork chops since I had just about given up finding a way to cook tender moist chops.  Unfortunately even though I followed the recipe closely my pork chops were still dry.  The sauce tasted great and I cut the leftover pork into small pieces and served the meat/sauce combination over rice which was better than the original.  Still, I was very disappointed and won't be making this again. Perhaps using a different cut of meat would be better such as a pork steak instead of pork chops.

Eight hours turned them into glop.  I recommend using a thicker cut of meat (my cut wasn't thick & it didn't turn out as wel).  I used the lowest of five settings on my crock pot when I was at work (8 hours) and they were dry, overcooked, fell apart.  No one could taste the bacon  (maybe that's just if it all falls apart & maybe it wouldn't fall apart with a really thick cut or if you can do only a 6 hour cook).  Someone suggested cutting toothpicks and soaking so they don't catch fire--good idea as mine did too in the broiler.
