for everyone complaining about too much grease: use less bacon or more potatoes.   for everyone complaining about undercooked potatoes: cut them up smaller.  for everyone complaining about overcooked onions (and undercooked potatoes): turn the heat down on the stove. the knob has more than just "on" and "off" settings.

This is the best breakfast potato recipe I have made.  I only altered a bit.  I microwaved the potatoes for 6 minutes on high after I had sliced them.  I used fresh garlic (3 small cloves) crushed.  I cooked the onion and garlic in the grease for about 3 minutes before adding the potatoes.  I added Tony's creole seasoning.  I cooked for about 15 minutes more, then drained off all the excess grease.  Then I cooked for 10 more minutes until about half of the potatoes were browned.  Excellent.  I would recommend using a very good sized, deep frying  pan.  If I had used a bigger (diameter) pan, more of the potatoes would have browned.

I make this all the time and its amazing but...you NEED to precook the potatoes! Boil them for 15 min., then add them to the fried onion in the pan. It won't be too greasy that way. =D

Okay, the flavors are great, but this recipe needs a few small changes in order to work.  I found I had far too much grease after cooking the bacon and poured some off before adding the potatoes, and my onions burnt after 20 minutes in the pan.  I'm giving this a three, because I'll definitely try it again - adding the onions 10 minutes into the cooking time, adding some salt and fresh pepper, and more potatoes/less bacon grease.  A good place to start.

These tasted pretty good but they did not get at all crispy. Also, there was no way the onion could fry for 20 mins without getting totally burned, so I threw it in about 6 mins til the end of the cooking time. Finally, have plenty of kitchen paper ready to absorb all the bacon grease. I'll probably try this again but with cubed potato. Thanks.

These taters were really delish MUZIKGUY and the family loved them! I added bell pepper to the mix along with more seasonings and to make to make cooking time a bit quicker, I popped the spuds into the microwave first, peeled, sliced and tossed them into the skillet. YUM!

These were SO FREAKIN GOOD! I made them to go with out Labor Day steaks and 6 people were supposed to show up and only 1 did. Still, all the taters got eaten!! I didn't have garlic pepper seasoning so I just used salt, pepper, garlic and a little chili to make them pretty, and they were PERFECT! This is my new go-to for fried potatoes! Can't wait to try them with eggs for breakfast!!!

Very good. I drained off some of the bacon fat before putting in potatoes and wished I had drained of a least half of the bacon drippings.  I followed another viewers recommendation and precooked the potatoes and it was very delicious.

I only made one change to the recipe and that was add a couple minced fresh cloves of garlic. OHMYGAWSH, these were so amazingly good. No, really. I wish I'd doubled them because we all wanted more but we ate every bit that I made. Next time, I'll double the recipe.

I make these spuds with several variations, and mostly for breakfast.  If you'll score the potatoes around the middle and place in a plastic bag before microwaving them........the peeling comes off very easily under some cold running water.  Then fry them in the skillet.  The Mexicans make Papas Rancheras with the addition of garlic, bell peppers/jalapenos, onions, some chili powder and about 1/4 cup of Picante sauce.  I also add some eggs to make a breakfast scramble.  This works equally well with sausage and/or diced ham.  A little grated cheddar on top is very good too. This reminds me of the Breakfast Skillets served at a popular restaurant chain.

These are amazingly good and similar to potatoes I already cook. I add grated Cheddar cheese and chopped chives to make these even better. Yum!

Tried this instead of my usual home-fried potato recipe from my mom. Although I like incorporating bacon (into anything, really) there is no good way to get the potatoes crispy. I am still giving it four stars because the potatoes were still declicious and often it is a matter of opinion how crispy a potato should be!

These are delicious!  I drained off a good amount of the bacon grease as well - there was a lot in the pan after frying the bacon.  Someone topped it with sour cream??  That I will have to try - yum!  I sliced my potatoes medium-thin and they were done in 20 mins along w/ the onions and fresh garlic I put in.  Loved this!

oh wow! I rough chopped 5 medium-sized russet potatoes. I boiled them for 15 minutes exactly and then threw them into the pan I'd already cooked off the bacon in. They were mushy!!! Operator error :)I cooked the potatoes for another 15 minutes throwing in the onions for the last ten. These were delicious! The flavor is OUTSTANDING!!! Next time (and there will be a next time and it might even be tomorrow night!!!) I will boil for only 10 minutes and keep the frying time to 15 minutes. I only fried up 5 slices of bacon and I ended up adding a generous pour of canola oil and it was just the right amount of oil. I didn't get any crispiness but hey! THE TASTE!!! Last thing, I generously salted the water when I boiled the potatoes. I will always do that from now on. when I tested the potatoes for doneness I ended up just eating that one little hunk and it was great! LOVE LOVE LOVE these potatoes and my meat-and-potatoes-brother-in-law CHOWED LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW!

We like this recipe. Its very similar to something I make for breakfast all the time.  I microwave the potatoes before frying them, so everything cooks sooner and nothing burns .I added green pepper because we love them and served this with barbequed boneless country style rib ends.  The next day for breakfast I threw it all in a skillet and cut up what was left of the rib ends and threw them in.  It was pretty good that way too.

WOW...these are great.  My husband was certain that anything cooked in bacon drippings wouldn't disappoint....and he was right!  They didn't taste oily or horribly bad for you, just melted in your mouth.  To help with calories, I cut the bacon suggestion in half as well as the garlic seasoning.  It was just too much garlic!  Overall these potatoes were a hit and everyone wanted more when they were gone.  Will certainly make again!

These are really good (but what isn't good fried in bacon drippings :)?  I had a full house tonight for dinner and with all the talking, kids running around, etc... I forgot to sprinkle the crumbled bacon on top before serving. They were still great! I didn't have garlic pepper seasoning so just added garlic powder, kosher salt and ground pepper to taste. I know we will make these again, and hopefully remember the bacon on top next time. Thanks for sharing!

These potatoes were fantastic.  I didn't make the recipe exactly, because I didn't have some of the ingredients.   I used granulated garlic with some black pepper. (I didn't have the garlic pepper seasoning)  I also added some salt to taste.  This recipe is going into my recipe box. Thanks so much. It is such a wonderful addition to everything else I make at breakfast!

We always make this in our cast iron skillet when camping. Smells so good the other campers want to know what is for breakfast. :-P

The low rating could be my failed adjustments: I used 3 potatoes and 9 strips of bacon. The potatoes were a little dry. If it really needs that much bacon fat, I won't be making this one again. I might try a modified version mixing my own garlic pepper with a ratio that favors the garlic more and the pepper less, using olive oil with just one or two bacon strips crumbled on top. My daughter didn't care for the dry consistency.

I usually use leftover boiled potatoes, leftover steamed cabbage,  lots of sliced/diced onion, no bacon but, sometimes, throw in  whatever scraps of corned beef or ham I have. Nowadays I cook in olive oil instead of bacon fat. Have always served it for supper but my mom called it the 'dogs breakfast' even though we never had a dog & yes she always used bacon grease.

I've cooked potatoes like this for years. The only thing I do differently is use fresh garlic and pepper instead of garlic pepper seasoning. This is also a great way to use up leftover baked potatoes, and I always cook extra baked potatoes so I can fix these for breakfast the next morning.

Absolutely fantastic!  My family loves this recipe & we will NEVER have the frozen ore ida potatoes obrien again!  very easy to make even though I made a few changes: I added a few cloves of fresh garlic, also used 1/4 of a red onion & 1/4 of a yellow onion. also added 1/4 of a red & 1/4 of a green bell pepper. Fabulous!

The next time I make it, I will drain all but 2T of bacon grease before adding the onions and potatoes. Other than that, it was very tasty.

I've made this three times and it was a HUGE hit each time! I also mince 2 or 3 cloves of garlic and use an entire onion. The last time I made it I used olive oil and skipped the bacon. The bacon is absolutely devine, but in the best interest of health...I opted out and they were STILL a HUGE hit! I served them as written, with bacon to go with "Simple Country Ribs" another can't go wrong recipe and some cole slaw for a football game dinner with friends. Every morsel was enjoyed!

Good potatoes, simple, easy.  I actually cooked the bacon prior and didn't include it inside the potatoes,  just used the greese (and added a little olive oil).  More seasoning - seasoned salt, some crushed pepper flakes.

Such simple seasoning that made these fantastic! I added extra bacon and potatoes. I also substituted russet potatoes for yellow potatoes, and dried minced onion since I had no yellow onion on hand. Added alittle salt as well. Perfect!

Loved this simple little recipe!!  Love Manofhorn's review, basically he's saying, use common sense when making this.  I poured off a some of the bacon grease and cut my potatoes into pretty small cubes to make sure they get done before my onions burnt up.  So good, topped with a fried over easy egg :)

I turned this into a quick and easy dinner - years ago! While waiting for the potatoes to cook, I threw in cut up chicken breasts. Quick and easy and delicious. In fact my youngest asked for the recipe today so he can make at school!

I really appreciated this recipe. I made it tonight when another recipe fell through. It was delicious and a hit with the family. I added minced garlic along with powder and the flavor was perfect.

I just made a close version of this recipe with tonight's dinner.  We were having pork chops for dinner & I needed a quick side.  I checked out this recipe & it came out awesome!  I had some Idaho & a few red skin potatoes so I diced them along with an onion & sautéed with some bacon grease.  What isn't good with some bacon grease?  There wasn't a lot which is another reason they were so good!  I used some garlic pepper to season!  *This would be good for a brunch..

Perfect! Made it for brunch and noticed people complained about it being too greasy. I used coconut oil SPRAY.  I already don't like to fry anything so all i did was spray the whole pan around three times. I wanted a potato side for my omelet and stumble on this recipe. Thank you! 

Oh and I sprinkled Monterey cheese along with the bacon at the end... awesome!

The lady is right - you have to boil the potatoes first and slice - I would suggest that you cook the bacon and then discard the grease - wash the pan and then fry in the butter and garlic until the poatates just start to get a little golden and then add the onions and bacon - peppers sounds like a great addition and some mushrooms wouldn't hurt along with some parsley or basil and cool until the potatoes are a nice golden colours just a little crispy on one side

Nothing really special about this, but maybe it was the changes I made.  I drained the bacon grease & just added a few spoonfuls back in w/ the potatoes.  I nuked my spuds for 2 min before slicing.  They looked good, but lacked something.  Def need more seasoning.  Probably won't try this again.

Very good indeed! I used some vegetable shortening instead of bacon (though did mix in bacon bits) and added minced garlic and green peppers. It was a big hit with everyone! Definitely will make it again.

A little common sense people...use more potatoes or less bacon! problem solved! I use red, white or yukon gold spuds so I don't peel. Let's me pretend is healthy :0) No matter...potatoes are great!
