This soup was great. I followed the suggestion of other users and used half chicken broth and half water. I also added about 10 pieces of cooked, crumbled bacon to it, as well as about a cup of chopped broccoli. And oh yeah-- I made this in the slow cooker. I cooked the potatoes, water, broth, onions and celery on "Low" for about 6 hours. (When the potatoes were tender.) I then stirred it up a bit with a fork to break the potatoes up and make a thicker soup. Then I added the cheese, and once it was melted, I added the milk/flour mixture, the bacon and the broccoli. I kept it heated until it thickened, and it was perfect for a cool day. Thank you!

Note: If you decide to go the slow cooker route, it is important that you don't add the milk or cheese until the end. Otherwise, everything seperates and looks kind of gross. I also chose to wait to add the broccoli because it can easily overcook in the time it takes potatoes to cook.

Excellent recipe!  I'm glad I read the reviews before making, as I did make a few changes:  I used a whole stick of salted butter, also added ground black pepper, garlic salt, and dried parsley and used sharp cheddar cheese vs. American.  Got out my trusty potato masher and mashed up the potatoes before I added the cheese.  Also took the advice of other readers and used 2 cups of water and 2 cups of chicken broth.  For garnishes I put out garlic and cheese croutons and Durkee french fried onions and served with a loaf of garlic toast.  Very, very good!  Would definitely make again!  Thank you!

Worked well with the following changes: cheddar instead of processed cheese (are you kidding?), green onions, garlic, salt, pepper, chicken broth instead of some of the water, and some worcestershire sauce. Didn't use as much butter either. Next time will use sharper cheese but less of it, and add a bit more worcestershire so the soup is tangy without being too fatty.

This was an excellent soup recipe. I found that it needed a little extra flavor, so I added 2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. The recipe was simple and didn't require a lot of fancy ingredients. Super!!

This is a wonderful recipe, if you want to you could add a little sour cream, for more creamier soup you could add a little more cream (heavy) or you could always add a little green onions!

Wish I could give this one 10 stars.  It will be on my list of favorite recipes and I have been cooking for many years.  I used Velveeta for the American cheese slices and could get enough of it!

Wow this soup turned out great!! I followed Dorese's modifications plus my own - used a slow cooker for about 6 hours on low(water, chicken broth,onions celery & potatoes) when tender added cheese - when melted added flour and milk mixture (added cornstarch also i like thick soups) then crumbled bacon and corn. It was wonderful.  Thank-you!

This was absolutely wonderful.....I did try it the way it was written up the first time and my family loved it then. The next time I did do Velveeta instead of sandwich cheese.  Mainly because I did not have that much sandwich cheese on hand.  My husband asked to cut down on the celery a little bit. I did try the chicken stock the second time or should I say a chicken bullion. My family loved this recipe. If your substituting stock for water or a bullion cube to make the chicken stock do not add salt.  I forget this allot of times that it will make anything way to salty.    I wish people would give the recipe the chance first.... and leave out what they family wont eat. You will make it again if nothing else use it as a good base soup and add then.  The first time I made this it was really good. So don't defeat the recipe before you try it like its written.  I can see someone using different cheese at first just because the amount of singles but nothing else at first.

I have tried to make cheesy potato soup before and failed.  This one was IT! I used the dried potato flakes instead of flour, salted butter, sharp cheddar cheese and some Velveeta cheese instead of the slices and I used dried parsley instead of fresh.  Four adults and many comments later, I had one large serving left!  I'm passing it on.  Thank you for a winter-ready recipe!

Let me start by saying I LOVE a good potato soup. But I had a lot of trouble with this recipe. I used eight potatoes (large baking potatoes), but that was WAY too much potato. I couldn't even fit all the potato into the pot. It was impossible to stir the potatoes, and some burned to the bottom. Maybe I should have used small yellow potatoes? The recipe doesn't really specify. Also, I don't eat American "cheese," so I attempted to substitute with sharp cheddar--but since real cheese doesn't come in prepackaged slices, I didn't know exactly how much real cheese to add. The end result was a thick paste, somewhere between soup and mashed potatoes. It was not particularly cheesy or flavorful--just tasted like potato. I'll keep looking for a more precise cheesy soup recipe.

My two toddlers, husband and I all enjoyed this soup!  It was cheesy, velvety and hearty.  I snuck in some carrots.  I steamed them in the microwave.  Then I pureed them with a little of the potato water and a big spoonful of cooked potato chunks.  It was a great way to add more vitamins... and it thickened the soup also.
I served this with some homemade bread and a salad with bleu cheese & garlic vinaigrette.  It was a fantastic meal for a cold night.

I made this recipe last week for my family. I did change a few things though. I omitted the celery because hubby does not like it. I used a combination of Velveeta & cheddar instead of sliced American cheese. I used chicken broth instead of water and I used evaporated milk as opposed to the other. I added salt, black pepper and onion salt. I added chopped ham and bacon bits. The soup turned out great and my family of 4 (and one guest) ate it all up in just 2 days! Thanks for the great recipe!

Based on all of the other reviews, I too, made several changes (that is why the 4 stars instead of 5). I used all broth instead of water, added carrots and garlic to the saute, and a pinch of red pepper flakes and white pepper while sauteing. I used ten small yukon gold potatoes and hand mashed them in the pot after cooking - that way I only needed to use half of the flour/milk mixture. For the cheese, I used half velveeta and half tillamook sharp cheddar (shredded). I, also had to add about a TBLS of salt along the way. Now it is fabulous!!

This is a fantastic base recipe, but I did make some minor changes.  Definitely substitute half the water with broth - I used vegetable broth, but you could also use chicken.  I substituted 16 oz of Cheddar and Monterey Jack for the processed American cheese and  I also added about 2 tbs of garlic to the onion / butter saute.  You will also need to add salt and pepper to the boiling potatoes, which the recipe doesn't mention.  Finally, I completely eliminated the celery.  I didn't see the need for it.  I am giving this 4 stars because of the changes I made, but it was a wonderful comfort dish on a cool autumn day.  I will definitely be making this again!

So good! I made this for dinner today, with these changes: I added two carrots, 3 vegetable bullion cubes, and used cheddar cheese instead of American. It was DELICIOUS!!! I will absolutely make this again. My daughter and her friend ranted and raved about it, they loved it so much. Saving this one!

Made this twice - first time as is - okay.  Next time, used suggestion to make it with chicken broth instead of water.  When potatoes were cooked, I did lightly mash some of them to add thickness to the soup.  I tried about 1-1/2 c. shredded swiss cheese in place of the american slices and added about 1 c. diced ham and a few cooked crumbled slices of bacon. Plenty of salt in it already, but did add ground black pepper.  HOME RUN!!!!  Yummmmm :)

WOW WOW WOW!! SO YUMMY!! 
My hubby and I both really enjoyed it! I took reviewers advice and added a chicken boullion cube and chicken broth rather than just water. Also added some minced garlic. I topped it off with bacon bits sour cream and shredded cheese. A++++++++

Easy and good. I used this as a jumping off point and made everything in one stockpot adding one container of Trader Joe's Mirepoix and three cloves of garlic along with bacon strips to start with, quartered Yukon Golds, then later mashed them in the pot. Also added 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard. I know that's not exactly the recipe but I always improvise and cook with some abandonment.

Nice soup.  Definitely needed more seasoning but overall a nice simple soup.  Makes a whole bunch so it would be great for a pitch in a group lunch.

I have made this a handful of times and it never disappoints.  It’s great with a green salad and some crusty warm bread.  Very yummy and sure to please anyone.  My 16 year old son gets excited when I tell him….”Honey, I’m making your favorite cheesy soup!”

This was a great recipe - I did however add to it...I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk to make it super creamy, chicken broth instead of water to give it a little extra flavor and Pancetta (Italian Bacon). The Pancetta gives it a really nice flavor, especially if you like meat in your potato soup. I think I only used four slices because that's all I had left but I'll try adding more next time. I just sauteed it with the onions and butter (left out the celery) and the soup turned out really nice.

I made this soup a couple days ago and we really enjoyed it. :)

After reading the reviews, I wanted to use chicken broth instead of water, but, I couldn't find one at that time. So, I decided to use about 1tbsp of powdered chicken broth to add some more flavors to the soup. 

I agree with other reviewers that the use of sharp cheddar cheese will increase the flavor of the soup. So, I wanted to use sharp cheddar cheese instead of American cheese (slices).  

But, after thinking about it for a while, I decided to use American cheese slices. I did so because I actually made creamy soup about a week ago (w/ a different recipe) and unfortunately, for some reasons, my soup was separated at the end. I believe that the reason was that the cheese & the soup base wasn't blended well. I was afraid of it to happen to my soup again. 

When I put American cheese slices in the soup base, they melted perfectly. It was very easy to handle, too. I also added milk & flour mix to the soup (I added about 1~2tbsp more flour to make the soup thicker).

The soup was very flavorful. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe :)

Wow this was great! Although I made some changes. I was afraid it would be bland so I added seasonings, as the recipe does not call for any. Ok, so here is what I did, I followed the recipe up until the potatoes were tender. I then added garlic salt, salt, pepper, and a little bit of lemon pepper. I used sharp cheaddar cheese instead of the sliced cheese. I just bought a 1/2 lb chunk, diced it up, and threw it in when recomended to. I ended up having to add more milk, as there was not enough liquid. This was yummy! I served with baguettes from my local grocery store. You must try this. Not sure if my family would have liked it without all the seasoning I added, but that is up to you.

I've made this several times now and it always turns out great.  We like garlic so I add some fresh minced garlic to the celery and onion and it gives it a little extra flavor.

This is the best meal I have ever had. Don't follow anyone else's suggestions and use the real deal. I love it! I cut up the celery a bit smaller, but that's all! This is the best cheesy potato soup I have ever had! I love this! This is my 1st or 2nd favorite meal ever. I love it!

This really is a great base for cheesy potato soup. Chicken or vegetable stock really must be used instead of water for flavor. I added a bit of carrot to the veg mix along with freshly minced garlic. I also added red pepper for a kick along with corn and bacon before serving. I used cheddar cheese which was great. I mashed some of the potatoes for thickness and texture. Milk is yummy and cream is amazing.

I think this soup is great with some alterations.  I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  I also sauteed minced garlic with the onions and celery.  Instead of cheese slices I use either Velveeta or Cheese Whiz.  I also add either bacon pieces or diced ham at the end.  It is overall a great recipes!

Fantastic soup. Made a few changes- Omitted the onions (hubby doesn't like them), added garlic, thyme, and oregano while sauteing. Used cheddar instead of american cheese. Big hit for us!

I used 1/2 broth 1/2 water and cheddar cheese.  It was very thick because all my potatoes turned to mush.  Next time I won't cook the potatoes so long.  Oops.  It was still tasty, though!

This was a good potato soup and was relatively easy to make. I think it needed a bit more spice, but since I am not a strong cook (I am working on that, which is why I am here), I am not sure what to add to improve it. Would probably try again.

Yummmm!!!  I boiled my potatoes in chicken broth, used Velveeta cheese instead of American, and I thickened the soup with instant mashed potato flakes.  Then I topped it off with bacon bits.  It was wonderful!!

I made this for my family and it was great for a quick dinner. I did change some things as others suggested, I used 4c chicken stalk instead of water, salted butter, no onions (DH doesn't do onions) I used a bit of onion powder instead (what he doesnt know won't hurt him right!), also some garlic powder, velveta instead of cheese slices and cooked up some bacon to put on top.  It tasted very good - but I think if I would have follwed the recipe it would have been very bland. I will def make this again but I will keep my changes.

I just made this soup and it was so good! I used Velveeta cheese, salted butter, water and chicken broth, and added broccoli and carrots. First I boiled the potatoes and drained them. Then I basically added all the ingredients and simmered it until it thickened and the carrots and broccoli were done. A very simple, yummy comfort food!

This wonderful recipe reminds me of one of the most popular soups in Ecuador.  It is called Locro.  It is made with mushy potatoes, fresh yellow cheese & chicken broth.  They serve it with sliced avocado, a circle of red or green baby bell pepper and a sprinkling of popcorn on top. I used Velveeta when I got home & it turned out great.  Spread the avocado out like stems.  Top the stems with a circle of pepper & place a popcorn in the middle of the pepper.  It will look like a flower on your soup.  Beautiful presentation for guests!   I serve it with Red Lobster Cheese Biscuits.

I loved this recipe even though I made a few changes. I used 1 pound of velveta cheese, 2 cubes of chicken bullion, garlic, cajun spice, and fresh parsley. My husband is a coon a** from Louisiana so he eats spice in everything!!! It was delicious!

The slices of American cheese did not add good flavor to the soup. I would add both a better quality cheese and less of it to make it better.

Definitely add garlic, sour cream, salt and pepper! And I substituted half the water for chicken broth and cheddar instead of American, it was great!

This was really good, although I did alter it to suit my tastes, it still deserves 5 stars. I used light butter spread, non-fat milk, reduced fat cheddar and better than bouillon to make broth. I also added celery salt rather than celery, garlic powder and fresh ground black pepper.

Really good soup, and fairly easy to make. We added bacon like many other people did. Very yummy in a soup bowl. Definitely keeps you warm at night and fills you up quite easily.

This soup was great. I deviated the recipe slightly based on tips from others on this recipe. Added garlic to the celery, onion sautee mixture. Used cheddar instead of American  cheese or Velveeta. Added diced ham. Served in a bread bowl with freshly diced tomatoes, a little shredded cheddar and fresh parsley. My first time making soup and it definitely won't be the last. Thanks again!

This recipe has the basics down.  I did lot's  of changes and then it was GREAT!

I used SALTED BUTTER... cause this receipe REALLY NEEDS SALT!
While cooking veggies, I added minced garlic.
I used chicken stock and added lots of salt and pepper.  I didn't have cheese slices, so I used Mild Chedder and Monterrey Jack and even sprinkled some parmesean.  After it all melted, I added a cup of heavy cream instead of flour, which made it so tasty and rich.  (I think I will have cup in a few minutes.)

NOT a fan of this soup at all. Made it exactly as recipe states and it had no flavor. Was not cheesy at all. I added a lot more cheese, pepper, various spices, lots of salt, etc. and still not impressed. Will not make again.

The soup was good. 
I agree with the other reviews in that it needed a bit more salt. I used all chicken broth instead of the water, and added a bit of the flour to the onion,celery and butter mixture. I will make it again but will add either some bacon or chopped ham, and some shredded cheddar or maybe some sharp cheddar or jack cheese.

This is easy and tasty. I followed suggestions and added 1 chicken stock cube along with the water (if you don't use chicken broth/stock then be sure to salt the potatoes as they cook for a much better flavor, not so bland), added cheddar instead of processed cheese (used about 3/4 c grated), added 1/4t garlic granules and topped with green onions as I didn't have parsley. It was really a nice blend of flavors and so easy to make. I'm making it again tonight -- twice in one week.

I was looking for a recipe to mimic my dad's potato soup.  This didn't do it--it was better!  (Sorry, Dad.)  The texture was absolutely perfect.  I left the potato skins on, used 12oz of Velveeta instead of the cheese slices (didn't want to open all those packages), and added a little garlic salt and black pepper at the end.  I didn't mash the potatoes as others have suggested, but I did kind of poke at them with a spoon when they were really tender so that they fell apart into smaller pieces.  Turned out delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, although I did alter the recipe a bit to our tastes.  I cut out the celery since my husband hates it.  I used half water / half chicken stock and sharp cheddar cheese instead of American cheese.  We topped it off with bacon crumbles and a dollop of sour cream to make baked potato soup.  Will definitely make again.

i added carrots and broccoli for some more variation and omitted the celery. i used some celery seed instead, about 1/2 tsp or so. i also used bagged preshredded cheddar cheese instead of the slices. this is easy to reheat the next day - just add some milk to thin it out a little, warm it up and you're ready to go.

This was really good and perfect for a cold night.  I used velveeta instead of the cheese slices, and used all chicken stock instead of the water.  I also doubled the cheese because my husband and I both like it cheesy!  Really easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand.

I was so disappointed when I sat down to enjoy this.  It was so bland.  I followed the recipe as is and wish I would have seen the other reviews BEFORE making this.  It turned out too runny, and I had to mash up some of the potatoes to thicken it.  I had to add lots of salt and pepper to make it enjoyable.  And the american cheese didn't really do it for this recipe.  Cheddar, or Velveeta, would suit it better I believe.  Definitely listen to the other reviews that suggest adding the other things, like chicken broth, etc., to spicen it up.  I will try this recipe again; however, I will make many adjustments.  It has great potential.

Excellent soup for a cozy winter evening.  Used velveeta, carrots and garlic as suggested by others.  Next time I make it I will make it exactly the same way.  The Velveeta cheese makes it sooo creamy!

A++++!  This soup is delicious and so quick and easy.  I was able to make it in no time with ingredients I already had at the house.  Such a good thing.  It tasted fantastic!  Just what I was looking for.  I used parsley flakes instead of fresh and it was fine.  I also used velvetta cheese and it made it taste great.  Defiently a winner and will make again.  I already added it to my recipe box!  Thanks for a good one!

Very good recipe for a cold or rainy day and it's easy to make. I did add 2 cups chicken broth with 2 cups water, instead of 4 cups of water, and added garlic, garlic salt, salt and pepper. I would recommend this recipe to others.

I needed something quick and easy for dinner one night and pulled this up.  I used 3 cups of shredded sharp cheddar instead of the slices and put a lot of garlic salt and pepper.  I also threw some bacon in the microwave and added it.  The only recommendation would be to not add the bacon until ready to serve.

I halved this recipe for me and my husband and now I wished that I had made the full recipe.  There were no leftovers.  I did add some chopped carrots when I added the potatoes.  I sprinkled it with bacon for a little extra flavor.  I agree with others and also added salt and pepper.  Next time I will make the whole recipe so we can have leftovers!!

An excellent recipe. My whole family enjoys it. It has become one of our favorites. Very quick and satisfying. The only modification I have made is to use a little chicken stock in place of some of the water.

Yes I will definitely be making it again. Very quick to prep and easy to cook. The only change I made was adding diced up ham. Just because my boys like their soups to be meaty.

The ingredient, "eight potatoes", is vague, since they can vary in size. Two pounds worked out well.

I cut back on fat and calories by using skim milk and reduced fat shredded Colby Jack. It wasn't noticeable at all. I used chicken broth instead of water, and tossed in some halved baby carrots to cook with the potatoes. This was delicious soup!

This turned out AMAZING!  I used the Colby jack shredded cheese for ours.  I put in bacon crumbles and garnished with more cheese!  (I love my cheese ??). My kids even loved it and the don’t like soup of any kind.  For me not being very domesticated in the kitchen, it was a win for me!

Some nice warm soup for a cold day. I made a few modifications, ..I used grated gouda and havarti , instead of processed 'american' cheese. ( because I had them on hand and love the creaminess that gouda gives to a soup). And a little dash of salt and pepper.

8 potatoes was way too much! It barely fit in my pot. But when we finally ate it, it was bland. It didn't have much flavor to it and will need to tweak the recipe for next I make it.

Didn't need the flour thickener. I found you can just about use the amounts of ingredient measured the way you feel it will work. It's very good. Seems it's the type of ingredients-fresh, sliced cheese etc that makes it. It's worth your time to try it!

I'm always experimenting. This experiment came out great. My family loved this potato soup. We enjoyed the chunks of potatoes, I used Russets.  I used Velveeta cheese - pretty close to 16 oz., cut into cubes.  My son is gluten intolerant, so I substituted gluten free flour and the soup thickened just fine. I'm just learning to cook gluten free, so I was pleased this came out so well. I skipped the garnish at the end, but other than that I followed the recipe to the tee.  I will definitely add this to my regular list of menu items.

Delicious and easy to throw together. Took less than an hour from start to finish. My potatoes must have been bigger because I only used 5. I stopped adding them when they reached the top of the liquid in the pot. I added some green onion and some garlic for more flavor. The wife loved it.

I'm not a scientist but after calculating the American singles to a cheddar cheese ratio and then calculating the actual amount of any kind of potatoes you wish to use, this can be cooked by anyone that cooks.  I loved it and use this recipe but include your god given smarts to calculate what you need.

Really great winter soup. I do use real sharp cheddar cheese. I find the best way to get it to thicken is to let it simmer for 3-4hours, stirring every 20 minutes or so. I also garnish with crumbled bacon, sour cream, and green onions.

The soup was delicous! Easy to make, and only took around an hour. I did as the others were saying and used half water half chicken broth, and I also used sharp cheddar rather than processed cheese. I added a little bit of green onion as well. Next time I make the soup I'm thinking of adding some broccoli. With a side of steamed vegetables and garlic bread, it was an excellent dinner!

this soup is a great base for just getting started, and tweking it to your familiy's taste is so much fun and so easy, being a kid who cooks for the whole family is hard sometimes, but a good potato soup is an easy stay in one place and chop and dump, with AMAZING results. step up this recipe with a bit of bacon grease and crisped bacon to the top, half chicken stalk, and half beef, delicious and hearty, treat this like a baked potato and you can't go wrong ;)

I also used the base to this recipe...I changed a few things but not many I used velvetta cheese and used chicken bouillon cubes instead of just water. Over all an excellent dish! Also used celery salt instead of celery but to basically give it the flavor, since my children do not care for celery.

Now this is a good potato cheese soup! I subbed cheddar for american cheese (yuck) and evaporated milk, since I was out of regular milk. Also, 8 potatoes is way too many, I used only 4 and that was plenty. Loved this soup, will make again, an easy lunch.

I added some leftover bacon and ham from Christmas breakfast, some corn, and 8 oz. sour cream plus salt and pepper. I left out the parsley. Oh, and I used 16 oz Velveeta instead of American cheese singles. It was delicious!

This rating is based on changes that I made but that is why I love this site!  The reviews are so helpful in making the recipe to your own taste!  With that being said, after reading the reviews, I used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken broth, salted butter (will use unsalted next time), added garlic salt and pepper, I also fried about 10 pieces of bacon and added that, and used the small package of velveeta. I did not use the parsley.  YUM

My very picky husband loved this!  Super easy.  I didn't have celery so I added celery salt while I sauteed the onions.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  Next time I'll add a little more salt and some pepper.

I think I had assumed from the recipe that this would be a creamier and thicker soup than it actually was.  I was a little watery for what we were looking for and not very cheesy tasting, even after adding heaps more cheese.  Still, it was a good soup despite not quite being what was expected.  So, good, but not great.

Yummmm! I am so glad I found this recipe. I love cheese and after having cheese soup at a local restaurant, I thought I would try making my own. This soup is even better than the restaurant one! I did make a few changes after reading some reviews. I used salted butter and substituted half the amount of water with chicken broth to give it some flavor. I also added some green onions on top instead of parsley. This one is definitely a keeper. Will make often! Thanks!

i loved this recipe.  The only thing i changed was to thicken instead of flour i used 3 tbs (depending on thickness you want) of instant mashed potato flakes.  It got rave reviews!

We LOVED this soup. I followed the directions exactly, but didn't have sliced cheese. So I used Velveeta instead. It's the best potato soup recipe I've made. This has definately become a family favorite!

I've been making this for years and it's a very fulling, comforting soup. It's good with plain or cheesy bisquits. I usually make it during the winter. I don't like it as cheesy as the recipe calls for, so I set aside a little for myself before adding the cheese to the rest of the pot.

This soup was WONDERFUL! I used half chicken broth and half water. Also, I followed someone elses idea and crumbled bacon in it...YUM! Oh yeah...instead of celery I used finely chopped fresh garlic and sauteed it with the onions. Made some garlic bread to go with the soup and it was great!

Delicious.  I added 3 additional cups of water for more of a 'soup' feel and also chopped bacon bits served over the top make this recipe a winner.  (I also used salted butter, added pepper and 2 bay leaves to the recipe).

This was a good potato soup.  I used chicken broth instead of water and 12 oz of Velveeta cheese but it was a little bland still so I think next time I will add bacon or additional spices.  I only had 1/2% milk on hand so I used that but 2% or more or adding the sour cream like others suggested would make it creamier tasting.

This was a good recipe but desperately needed SALT. My husband and I were passing the salt back and forth through the whole meal.  I used red potatoes, and used 1/2 chicken broth/ 1/2 water like other reviewers said. I also did not have sliced cheese but used 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese instead.  I substituted carrots for the celery, and also added a can of corn at the end.  It was good once I added a lot of salt!

Wonderful! I also used Chicken stock in lieu of water. I also added a Tbls. of powdered Ham Soup Base. I used 4 oz of mild cheddar and 4 oz of sharp cheddar instead of the american. cheese. This is the best Potato Soup I have ever eaten.

I usually only leave reviews on really good recipes or really bad ones, this one is AWESOME, I've made it several times, it is much better with broth instead of water, also use at least 2% milk (whole milk/or half and half makes it creamier), just know you have to check your diet at the door!

Good but I think I may have used too little cheese.  I used only half of what was recommended (because I wanted to reduce salt content) and although it was delicious, something was lacking...maybe I will try mozzarella cheese mixed in next time.

This soup is great and I've made it several times.  I like my soup a little runnier, so I tend to add more milk or a bit of water to thin it out, but that's personal preference.

This was a great basic recipe.  I will add more meat of some sort (bacon or sausage) and more spices for flavorings.  Great start though.

I took the advice of other reviews, using chicken broth and garlic. At the end of cooking, I added bacon, chives, shredded cheese, and sour cream. It was like a loaded bake potato soup.  I also added a little Tony Chacheres to spice it up.  My husband and I loved it and will definitely have it again.

I followed the recipe exactly but wasn't as cheesy as I had hoped. Plus a little on the bland side :(

Very good and easy to make soup. Everyone liked it, even the kids. I used one can of chicken broth and one can of water which was suggested in the reviews and it worked out really well. I also used 1/2 a block of velveeta. It's a keeper for me.

Alright, I took the advice of using half water half broth.
I did not have slice cheese on hand, or enough cheese. I grated half a one pound block of cheese, and maybe 6-7 deli slices of swiss cheese. I must not have melted the cheese correctly, because it started to ball up.
So, what I did do is I added a packet of "just add hot water!" potato flakes, cheese flavor.
I also added chopped broccoli and a handful of baby carrots.

As you can imagine, my soup is more like mashed potatoes, and it tastes great. I'm sure I can add water or more broth to make it more soup like. 

I definitely agree that this recipe has great potential.
This was also my first time making soup!

I added garlic, chicken boullion and used velveeta cheese.  It was scrumptious!!  One mistake I made was that I didn't let the potatoes get soft enough before I added the cheese.

I was rather disappointed in how this turned out. It probably didn't help that it sat on the stove and cooked for two hours since my husband came home late. It got reall mushy and was basically just cheesy potatoes. I might try it again and not let it cook so long.

This soup turned out great.  I was skeptical of the american cheese slices, but they melt very smoothly and not oily.  I used the other reviewer's advice and used half water and half chicken broth.  It doubled beautifully.

This was very good - but I think the garlic that I added went a long way in adding flavor.  I gave it 4 stars because my 11-year-old did not like it much, but my other two younger children loved it.

I modified this to make 2 main-dish servings.  I used 2 Tbs. butter, 3/4 cup of each chopped onions and celery, 1 cup low salt Swanson chicken broth, 1/2 cup water, 10 oz. (after peeling) russet potatoes, 7 slices (5 oz.) Kraft American Cheese Singles, 1 Tbs. flour, 6 oz. milk, and 2 tsp. fresh parsley.  Did add some bottled hot red chile sauce.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, esp. when served with a green salad and fresh bread.

I enjoyed more tham grandma used to make!Thats how excellent this soup is!I dont think grandma could have made it any better plus It was easy and tasty all in one.You have to try for yourself,Its that simple!Joan Zaffary is a cooking genious!However I did not use the sliced cheese.I used 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar with tomato and basil.It is delicious!
