This is a recipe of good intent and poor effect. In addition, it was too much allspice for my taste. In hindsight, I should have made the meatballs prior to cooking and baked them on a broiler pan in order to reduce the amount of fat. Even so, I won't attempt to make this again.

Why the cabbage? Wrong spices used and turned out horrible. Will not make again. Family wouldnâ€™t eat it.
