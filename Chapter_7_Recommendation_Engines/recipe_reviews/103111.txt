Flavor was a tad overwhelming and the crust is not what we like. We will try it again with a couple changes. Use a premade crust less pesto and 1/2 marinated mozarella and 1/2 regular. That is most likely just a spice preference that my family has. Overall I liked the something other than red sauce pizza.

Simple and good!  I skipped the parsley just out of personal distaste and, to save some money, instead of prosciutto just made bacon cooked in Italian seasoning.  (It's not the same, but it works in a pinch.)

To many strong flavors between the basil pesto the grilling seasoning the rosemary and the blue cheese. Next time I will probably try more of a white pizza with the blue cheese steak and mozzarella.

This was great. I followed the recipe as stated then added caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms. Delicious blend of flavors between the pesto and mozzarella. Yum.

Great pizza! I used a Boboli crust added pepperoni olives left off the parsley and basil. Added a sprinkle of Italian seasoning. Next time I'll try it with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site.

This is good but not five stars for us. I did not use the fresh herbs because I felt the pesto would add enough flavor. It is salty but not too extreme. I topped it w/ fresh tomatoes after it cooled a bit---excellent addition.

Add any toppings you like. The key is to use pesto as the sauce and to use fresh mozzarrella. I will make this over and over.

This dish was fantastic with a few additions! I added fresh spinach fresh mushrooms black olives and fresh thyme. I skipped the prosciutto and parsley and then substituted the parmesan for romano cheese. Absolutely delicious and uber quick! I will be making this many more times!

This recipe was amazing. i used organic white pizza dough from Whole Food's and really enjoyed flipping it around like a pizza man! I also used a basil pesto sauce and I chopped up the prosciutto and spread it on top. My boyfriend couldn't get enough!

I was looking for a pesto pizza recipe and this one was great. The fresh mozzarella was key however I do not recommend using marinated mozzarella. The first time I made it I used marinated mozz and between that and the pesto there was just too much oil. I use a pizza pan with holes in the bottom so the crust gets crispy and oil leaked out all over the oven setting off the smoke alarm. The second time I used plain fresh mozz (I used 8 oz. since that was the size my store had) and it was perfect! I made Pesto (by ANDERVAL) from this site. The proscuitto got nice and crispy and the parm and basil sprinkled on top is a nice touch. Also I used store bought multi-grain pizza dough which added great flavor. My husband would be happy if I made this twice a week!

This was really good! My boyfriend made it for dinner last night - the only difference was that he did little French bread pizzas. I loved it. Very delicious.

We love pesto so this was easy to love. I used precooked mini naan instead and left out the basil and parsley. I only put it in the oven until the cheese melted. Before serving I topped it off with some balsamic vinegar.

Love love love this recipe! I make this often and change it up with the addition of our favorite veggies. Sometimes I caramelize onions as a topping sometimes zucchini spinach and/or asparagus. I think the key is the pesto. A very versatile recipe that can be made on pizza crust italian bread even pitas! My family devours it!
