Oh my goodness!!!  This was amazing!! I did a few things to it on my own - I didn't have time to look at other reviews first.  I used the Pillsbury crust - to DIE FOR!!  I also added some garlic powder - not a lot - but I put it in about everything I make.  I also added some dried onions - next time I think I will try to saute real onion with the chicken and brown them both a little bit before putting them in.  I also don't have a lot of canned veggies - my husband only likes frozen - so I threw a can of corn in with some frozen veggies that I barely cooked and drained them.  I used one can of cream of chicken, and the other can was a creamy herbed chicken (Campbell's).  I wasn't too sure of that, but it was great!!  I followed the directions on the crust package to cover the rim of the crust after 10 minutes - my husband was asking for leftovers the next night!!!! This was so good even my picky 4 and 2 year olds ate most of it!!  Thank you for this MUST HAVE!!

This chicken pot pie was better than I could have imagined! This was my first pot pie and I even made the crust myself! Both a first for me.  My wife and I ate over half the pie at one setting. She said it was better than any pot pie she had ever eaten. The only things I changed were  adding a little chopped up onion and  I used potato soup instead of chicken soup because I love potato soup.  I highly recomend this as a great tasting meal in itself!

Very good.  My husband and 4 kids love this.  I also sprinkle salt, pepper, garlic and onion and used one can of Cream of Chicken and one can of Cream of Potato soup.  I also only use 3 small cans of mixed peas and carrots...it is stuffed otherwise.  To make this even easier you can buy cooked chicken in a package. Simple and yummy!  Thanks for the recipe

This was a very good basic recipe.  I had some left over turkey breast so I used that instead of chicken.  I didn't have two cans of Cream of Chicken soup, so I just used one and one can of cream of mushroom.  I finely chopped half an onion and two stalks of celery and sauteed them in a couple tablespoons of butter until soft.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of minced garlic.  I added some thyme, rosemary, parsley and a touch of sage for added flavor.  I also used frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned.  Delicious!!

This is such a great recipe.   I substituted one of the cans of soup with a can of cream of potato soup.  Just a personal preference.  This is GOOD COMFORT FOOD.

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted wonderful. My boyfriend, who is a very picky eater, loved it, he also had several helpings of leftovers which he NEVER does. I used a Tyson roasted chicken instead of the breasts, and I think I like it better that way.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Ok - So, you've been looking at chicken pot pie recipes, reading reviews, wondering which one to choose. This one sounds good, but looks so simple that you wonder... Wonder no more - you have got to try it.  It is so simple, that you can make it on a work night and seem like you slaved all day.  My husband raves - and that is rare. He tells people that they just HAVE to come over to try my pot pie!  If they only knew how easy it is.  Especially if you cook the chicken the day before or at least have it thawed out (which I never seem to do).  I use frozen veggies, store bought pie crusts, and add a few tablespoons of dried minced onion. Oh and about 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Thats it.  It's great as written as well.  But it's so simple that you can play around with it.  One day I only had 1 can of cream of chicken.  So I used that and one can of cream of mushroom.  Still delish.  You would be hard pressed to ruin this.  So give it a try!!

This was not as tasty as I expected, but it was pretty good and very easy.  It turned out really well, but it desperately needed some salt. I used healthy request chicken soup.

This is so easy! I used refrigerated Pillsbury pie shells, a rotisserie chicken, frozen mixed veggies nuked until warm, a can of cream of chicken and a can of seasoned cream of chicken. I also carmelized chopped onion with garlic and tossed in some diced celery near the end. I added a little milk too with salt and pepper to taste- YUM

This recipe is so simple, quick, and easy! I am rating it only 4 stars instead of 5 due to the following changes: It tastes MUCH better to use one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of potato.  I use the Pillsbury's pie crusts (come in  a pack of two, red box) and found that the first time I made this recipe the bottom crust was very gooey. Prior to filling the crust, I stick it in the oven uncovered for about 5 minutes. In the end, the crust is very flaky and delicious!   Also, I use one 16oz bag of mixed vegetables, and only two chicken breasts. I made this for dinner when my husband invited a couple friends over and they loved it.

Best, thickest Chicken pie ever. Husband LOVES this and he is the cook in the family. I use Campbells Cream of Chicken with Herbs canned soup instead. Also boil then brown the chicken in 2tbsp butter and black pepper with some chopped onion. Fresh carrots, frozen peas and canned diced potatoes and you couldn't have a simpler weeknight dinner.  Delicious as leftovers also!

I used this basic recipe to create my own version, and am very grateful I stumbled upon it. :) I would say to anyone considering this recipe, there are a few changes you might make depending on your taste. First, SEASON your chicken and vegetable mixture. Without some salt and poultry seasoning, it tastes very bland. I also often add some basil, garlic and fresh pepper. Also, FROZEN vegetables are the norm in my household, I can't stand canned. I use a mixture of peas, carrots and sweet corn. I use ONE can of soup and about a cup of milk. Sometimes I use rotisserie chicken, if I find one at sale at the supermarket. Also, I use frozen pie crusts and it works just as well. It's a very versatile recipe, and you can change it just about any way you want it.

Huge hit at my house.  I can't give it 5 full star though, as I do believe it requires some "spicing up."  I add salt, pepper, fresh thyme, garlic and onion powders, sour cream and mozzarella cheese.  I also use an egg wash.  This pot pie seems to please just about everyone.

Tasty recipe when you're in a hurry. If you have some extra time, try leaving off the top crust and instead, top two pies with mashed potatoes! I like to boil a seasoned half chicken(more flavor than just breasts) Remove the chicken, then boil the cut up peeled potatoes in the same water. Drain and mash the potatoes when tender adding milk, cream cheese, butter, salt and pepper to taste. Meanwhile... Stir fry some sliced fresh carrots and celery until tender in some butter. Add some fresh mushroom pieces and frozen peas, salt, pepper and garlic and cook another minute or two. Add the veggies to your deboned cubed chicken and cream of chicken soup mixture. Fill up your pie shells and top with the mashed potatoes.

This was my first attempt ever at a Chicken pot pie, and I will say that this was the best base ever!   Only changes made: -Used Mixed Vegetables which contained potatoes, carrots, peas, and beans.  -Added 1.5 cups of shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture. -Diced the raw chicken and while browning it in olive oil, I dusted it with salt, pepper, and a bit of Garlic Powder.  Absolutely amazing!

This pot pie is great. It is so creamy and the flavors blend really well. I have never liked pot pie, but everyone else in my family does so I decided to try it.  I have been missing out!  We finished the whole thing in record time and it has already been requested again. Perfect dinner!

Easy to make, but bland and tasteless.  Needs every one of the tweeks that others recommend.  I am rating recipe as written.  By the time I made all the tweeks that it needed to be at all tasty, it didnt even resemble this recipe.

I used different spices and only had cream of mushroom soup, but the basic instructions for this dish really helped me out as I am new to making certain dishes. I also live in China with my husband and sometimes it is difficult finding easy to cook foods from home. This really helped!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It's fantastic for a quick and easy meal. It's yummy but not as good when made from scratch. This will be one of my go to recipes on nights when I'm tired.

I've been making chicken pot pie that's basically the same recipe for ages and it's always a huge hit.  Even my picky eater Dad who never understands why I bother making from scratch something that he enjoys the store bought version of really enjoys it.    I usually add about half a can of milk.

I read all the reviews and adjusted the recipe to fit my family. I cut up the raw chicken into chunks. I sauteed a slice of onion and some crushed garlic, added the chicken and sauteed till done about 7 minutes. I mixed 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of potato soup, salt and pepper. I used 2 cans of veg-all and bought the Pillsbury pie crusts. It was wonderful. My picky eater husband loved it. Thanks for sharing and all the tips from everyone. You can pretty much adjust the way you want and not screw it up. Enjoy.

This was so good!  I took other suggestions and used 1 can of potato soup and 1 can of cream of chicken w/herbs.  I also added fresh sage, pepper, salt, onion powder and garlic powder.  I used two large cans of pre-cooked chicken and 2 cans of mixed veggies w/no salt and it was perfect.  Served over white rice.  We are having the leftovers tonight and I can't wait!

Great basic recipe! I made this starting with homemade chicken stock/bone broth. Using that I made homemade cream of chicken soup. Then using my homemade sourdough starter I made a sourdough pie crust. Adding 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder adds depth to the flavor. The chicken I used (pasture raised) was smoked on my grill. I make this 3 to 4 times a month. Never tire of this meal in one dish.

This is an easy and yummy recipe.  I season it up with salt and pepper.  I also use Pepperridge Farms flaky crust for the top which makes it even more delicious.

This pie was delicious, and so easy. We like extra vegetables so I added 1 can of mixed veggies, a cup of frozen green beans, a cup of peas w/ pearl onions and a can of chicken broth to the soup for extra gravy.  Fast and easy dinner. All prep and cooking in about an hour.

I made this a few weeks ago and am making it again tonight as it was a big hit with my husband and 1 year old!  I used 1 can of creamed corn, 1 can of green beans, and 1 can of diced potatoes.  I am typically not a fan of canned veggies, but you honestly couldn't tell a difference.  I then used 1 can of cream of chicken (the reduced fat kind) and 1/2 cup of milk.  Very yummy!

This was a great quick option to make.  The entire family loved it, even the kids.  The only thing was it was lacking something in the flavor.  I will play with it next time I cook it maybe some salt and pepper, and a little paprika to give it a little zing.

This was my first homemade chicken pot pie and I thought it was fabulous!  I substituted one cream of chicken soup for cream of potato as well as added a dash of the following: salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder & rubbed sage.  Next time I will use fresh vegetables.  It's really delicious if you serve the pot pie slices on top of bowtie pasta.

I suprised my family with this recipe and everybody loved it! I should have made two pies because they gobbled it all up. I used one can of cream of chicken and one cream of brocolli. Also added potatoes and chopped onions and slow cooked everything for a few minutes before adding it to the pie crust. I used frozen vegetables  and seasoned everything with garlic powder and curry powder and some pepper.AWESOME!!!!

I'm starting to wonder about this website! I did not care for this recipe at all. I was highly suspect reading the ingredients, but so many people loved it, I tried it anyway. What a mistake. It takes like exactly what you'd expect. Cream of chicken soup with canned veggies.

Great Recipe.  I used rotisserie chicken, cooked potatoes, frozen corn, and canned green beans.  Hubby said it was a winner and my picky 8 year old ate most of it.  We only ate half as the pie is huge so I'm hoping the leftovers will be as good as the "out of the oven" version.  Thanks for the easy and tasty dinner.

This is great. This was my first time making pot pie. Very simple to make. I took the advice from previous reviews. I used frozen pie crusts, frozen veggies that I defrosted in microwave, and cream of chicken and potato soup. I added onion powder and some seasoning salt. My kids loved it and so did my husband. Everyone had seconds.

I have made this for my family 3+ times and for a new mom and dad with rave reviews. I have taken other users suggestions and added a few of my own.  I use the refridgerated pie crust, add chicken thighs to a pan of garlic and onion.  Remove the chicken to cool; add fresh asparagus (cut on a bias) and cook for 2-3 mins. then add a can each cream of potato & cream of mushroom soup (like others suggested) to the pan heat through, then add fresh shredded parm cheese, pepper and salt.  Blend all ingredients together and fill the prepared pie.  Bake @ 375 for 45 or till crust is light brown and crispy.

I tried this and it turned out pretty good.  I needed a larger crust (well I used two), but other than that, it was everything advertised.  I'll definitely make this again.

Tried this for dinner tonight and it turned out great!  I found a pie shell recipe on here that I tried also.  The only thing i did differently was to use one can of cream of chicken and one cream of potato (recommended by other reviews) and only used 2 cans of veggies.  It came out wonderful! My fiance loved it and  so did I.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

It was a pretty good, traditional flavored Chicken pot pie. My husband loved it! I did have to add a few dashes of Salt, Garlic Salt, Black Pepper, and onion powder. After all that, it was still a little bland. I only used 2 cans of mixed veggies, and that was plenty. I used a store bought 9" crust, so that may be why the 2 cans of veggies were just enough. Over all thank you for a great, quick and simple chicken pot pie. I will make again.

Excellent recipe!!! My first chicken pot pie, and it turned out so well! I used 2 cream of mushroom soups; next time I will definitely use cream of chicken, the mushroom is too sweet. I used pre-cooked Tyson chicken, a can of peas, a can of sliced mushrooms, and 3/4 bag of frozen mixed vegetables, plus pre-made pie pastry. EXCELLENT! For next time I will saute garlic cloves rather than use garlic powder. Thanks for the recipe! This is going in my "make again" file :)

I have been making a version of this recipe for about 10 years.  Most times I cook my own potatoes & carrots and add canned sweet baby peas. I usually use left over store rotissire chicken (quick-less cooking and cleaning). Sometimes I've used 1 can creamed chicken & 1 can creamm of mushroom for a different flavor.  I have even served this to guests and no one believed it was canned soup for the gravy.

This was a very easy recipe to make and with good results. I had to substitute based on what I had on hand. I cut up some celery and baby carrots and sauteed them in a small amount of butter. To that I added a can of diced potatoes and a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also added 1/2 can of milk. while that was heating up I seasoned my chicken breast with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder then grilled the breasts. I stirred the dieced chicken breast to the vegetables. I used the Pie Crust III recipe from this site. I made enough dough to make 3 individual potpies. Thanks, Michael, for a great recipe!

I have never made pot pie until now. This is a great recipie...very quick and easy! I made this for a potluck the other night and it was a hit. Great time saver to use pre-made pie crust. I would recommend this recipie when you don't have time to cook...it's declicious. My only suggestion is to reduce the veggies to only 2 cans, and to add some milk to the soup so that it won't be too dry. I also used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of potato as a personal preference.

This recipe hit home on every level: quick, easy and delicious! You could even call it Luscious "leftover" chick pot pie. I threw in some leftover chicken and veggies, added a can of cream of chicken soup (99% FF), rosemary, thyme and put it all in the crust. I can tell you for sure that this is what will happen to my leftover turkey at Thanksgiving this year!

Try using Pillsbury pre-made crusts in the refrigerated section.  Veg All veggies make it good two (I used two cans).  My husband LOVES this recipe.

What I love about chicken pot pie is that it's such a great way to use up the chicken from the roast you made the night before. For a fresher taste I used frozen vegies and only because I also had leftover gravy, I used that in lieu of the soup. My family loves "peasant" type food and for this kind of recipe, I don't recommend making your own pie crust. Save the homemade stuff for your next gourmet meal; for this, it's just not worth the time and effort. My family loved this dish and my younger daughter even ate it for her after school snack. Hubby's having the leftovers as I'm writing this review! Thanks Michael!

The recipe is very simple but it tastes like it came from a can (because of canned ingredients).  I'll take the time to chop fresh vegetables and make the sauce myself.

This was amazing! I added an onion while I was cooking the chicken and a clove of garlic; I couldn't really taste those ingredients but we eat them in just about every meal we make. My husband and two small kids devoured this meal and can't wait for me to make it again! There's nothing that needs to be changed in this recipe! Thanks for sharing.

This chicken pot pie was delicious. I only gave it four stars, because i didn't follow the recipe exactly. First, I boiled the chicken. In another pot, I boiled two potatoes, two carrots, two stalks of celery and two cups of green beans I had blanched and froze from our garden, along with a chopped onion. I boiled the vegetables for 25 minutes, until soft. Next, I cut up chicken. I drained vegetables, and added to a casserole dish,and added the chicken. Next, I added the two cans of cream of chicken soup, mixing until combined with chicken and vegetables. To cut back on calories, I didn't add a bottom crust.I  topped the casserole dish with a store bought pie crust. Baked 350 for 45 minutes. My husband and i both enjoyed it, and my husband asked for seconds. There is plenty left to have again tomorrow night. It's comfort food as we are having a blizzard, at the moment.

I fixed the recipe as suggested and had enough for 2 deep dish pies. I added about 2 tsp dried chopped onion, 2 tsp minced garlic and a few tbsp of the vegetable juice. poured into 2 deep dish shells, dampened the top of each crust, used regular crusts for the top. Flipped the top crust on and squeezed it down a bit. Removed the pan, poked a few holes in the top crust and replaced the pan for the first 30 min of baking. Reset the timer for 15 min. It wasn't done so I reset the timer for 10 min 3 more times before it was browned and the filing bubbling. Let them sit for 20 min before cutting. They were perfect. The last ones I used turkey instead of chicken. Any kind of left over meat or even tuna fish is good. Try different creamed soups or use peas and carrots, broccoli in place of the veggies.

Used leftover (read: scavenged) whole baked chicken remnants, chopped, with drained canned mixed veggies.  There was about 3/4 cup leftover gravy which mixed in with an easy white sauce, fresh ground pepper, nutmeg and a splash of white wine.  Mixed tog until warmed through, placed in 9" pie tin, topped with crust, baked at 350 degrees for 30-45 min.

This is a simple, yet very good recipe. My husband loves it and he is kinda picky. I don't put in a whole bag of veggies, instead I dice up potatos. They need to cook longer than the pie, so I boil them for a few minutes first. Just an idea if you like potatos.

This is DELICIOUS. I used cans of Veg-All's mixed vegetables because they have a great variety of vegetables (green beans, carrots, potatoes, lima beans, corn, and peas). I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of potatoe like others suggested. And, I used the Pilsbury crust. I also added a few spices... ground pepper.. salt.. chicken seasonings on the chicken. and i also added 1/2 an sauteed onion. DELICIOUS. My family loves it, and even my mom was impressed.

This dish was fast and easy to make!! Tasted great!! I added some onion and mushrooms into mine, just for a bit more taste. Mixed in 1/4 cup of ketchup into the chicken as well to add a bit of a kick to it.  Will definitely make this again!

Love this recipe. Changed one of the cans of soup  to a cream of mushroom. Only used 2 cans of the mixed veg and added 1 can of diced potatoes. I added seasoned salt and black pepper to taste. I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust baked at 350 with foil around the rim until the last 12-15 minutes of baking. This pot pie is everyone's favorite and so simple to make.

I first made the recipe to the letter and that's why I'm giving this 1 star. It was very bland...sorry.  I see that others are giving this recipe 4 and 5 stars but with many changes...this does change the outcome and is not a true rating.

Not as easy as some of the other pot pie recipies I have come across, but not hard at all. I prefer the taste of this one over the others. Very good

Every time I try a new recipe, my husband rolls his eyes.  This time, though, he was very pleasantly surprised!  I got compliments all evening over this one.  I did add a little milk to make it more creamy, and it does need salt!  Used only 1 can mixed veggies, and 1 can each of corn and green beans.  The Pillsbury pie crust makes this a masterpiece!

Used frozen veggies and one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken (both low fat).  The flavor was awesome.  Easy and good.  Added pepper, garlic powder and basil to the mix.  Great way to sneak veggies into picky eater's diet!  Oh, I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and refrigerator crust, worked great.

This was pretty good- I made two pies because we have a big family, and it went over well.  I usually make chicken pot pie with a homemade white gravy, so I was nervous about using the soups, but it works out good if you are in a pinch for time.  I added Tony's creole seasoning for extra flavor.

this recipe was incredibly easy - i agree with the others, for using the pre-made pie crusts and different creamed soups. i have made this twice now and both times used campbell's cream of celery and cream of potato. these both worked very well and the flavor is superb! i added both garlic salt and garlic powder, as well as a LOT of fresh ground pepper (we like our pepper). i also cut up four stalks of celery and a cup of baby carrots and five tablespoons of finely diced yellow onion. i don't know if you have a costco, but i especially like using half of one of their roasted chickens. the meat is very moist and really ads to the homemade taste. my man-friend likes this just as much as he likes my other gourmet recipes. which is great, because it is so easy! thanks for posting this recipe!

This was delicious!!  I followed the advice of the other reviews. I used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of potato and mixed in 1 can of milk. Only used 2 chicken breasts, 8 oz of frozen veggies, added 1 potato (cubed in popped in microwave for 2.5 minutes), 4 sliced mushrooms, 1 clove garlic, and 1/2 of a medium onion. I sauteed the mushroom, onion and garlic together. Added some italian seasoning herbs....AMAZING. I also used the Pillsbury pie crusts---so EASY! Will definitely make again.

I read a few pot pie recipes and added a bit of every one of them to my liking. I substituted a can of cream of potato for the cream of chicken, sauteed onions with my chicken and seasonned the chicken as it was cooking in my pan with poultry seasonning, accent salt and pepper. I then added a small bag of frozen veggies and soups and 1/4 cup of milk, and also added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. It was not overpowering, just make it all creamier, I simmered for about 5 minutes and placed my filling into my pie. I bought pre-made pie crust and it worked wonderful. I covered the edges with foil until the last 10 minutes. After 30 minutes, I raised the temp to 400 for the rest of the time.. and timing was perfect. ready in 55 minutes! My hubby LOVED it, had seconds.. so did I and my little one ate it too. We have left overs for lunch today. YUMMM-O!

This dish got rave reviews from everyone in my household, including a very picky husband and my children actually ate all of the vegtables. I made it a little harder on myself because I made the pie crust but definately the right amount of ingredients to make a perfect pot pie.

This was very good, fast, and easy!  I used one small bag of frozen mixed veggies, one can of cream of chicken soup and I also added about 1/2 cup shredded cheese.  I cooked mine as directed and after 45 minutes the crust was still not done.  I turned the temp up to 400 and cooked for another 15 minutes and it was perfect.  It could use a little salt and pepper, but even so I still plan on making this often.

I absolutely love this recipe and I have made it several times now. The only thing I have added is potato and corn. I have also added some savory spices such as rosemary & thyme. My husband said it was the best thing that I've cooked since we've been married. (which is about 3 years) He actually requests this recipe now. Thanks for this little gem! It also makes great leftovers.

It was quick and easy! I fed 3 adults and 2 kids! And we still had leftovers! It was a little bland though, I would add something too it, garlic salt maybe. Probably will use fewer veggies next time too, and will season them with parsley or the like. I say give this one a try if you're in a hurry, but don't expect too much from it.

Yum. And thankful for the reviews saying to use 1 can of cream of potato, 1 can of cream of chicken instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken. Would suggest precooking the bottom crust slightly prior to adding the filling like someone suggested, mine was soggy, but still delicious.

Very tasty,  definitely my new go to when I'm needing comfort food.  LOL.  I did tweak a little due to what I had. I used 2 frozen deep dish pie crusts (the 2nd was used for the top crust). I used 1can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of chicken mushroom soup.  I used 1can of diced potatoes,  1 can of corn,  1/2 can of carrots,  and 1/2 can of green beans  (i cut the green beans & carrots in halves).  Seasoned with a little garlic powder and pepper.  Very tasty.  I think though the next time I make this  (cuz there will be a next time) I'm going to use a bigger can of cream of chicken soup for a little more creaminess.

I used cream of potato soup instead of cream of chicken and it was fabulous! I will definitely be making this again!

Recipe results in enough filling for 2 pies, so I did that. Added dried onions, a little poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. Tasted great! Family said I can make it again.

This was the quick fix easy to "make it your own" base recipe I was looking for to make a chicken pot pie for someone as a "thank you"gift.
 I usually tend to go heavy on the "gourmet", not always your best bet on comfort type foods  your making in hopes it will appeal to most peoples taste. My personal changes would be inline with many of the other reviewers, a lot of good options but when seasoning keep in mind that the original recipe has a lot of salt/sodium in it already if using canned vegetables, 420 mg per 1/2 cp canned versus almost none with frozen, and I usually get the heart healthy request version of the Campbells soups also, which can have as little as 1/4 the salt as the regular! I usually get these frozen organic mixed veggies from costco, they taste almost fresh, but having used them in recipes before sometimes I'll hear a comment or two on them not being cooked enough, likely from people used to the canned variety. Funniest of all was a comment on the little "lima beans" not being "ripe" or something... they were actually "edamame"!  And go with the Redi-crust, those frozen ones really aren't just as good, if anything they take away from the efforts of having made the dish yourself in the first place. The rolled up refrigerated ones are amazing, and if you brush the top with some milk, egg white or egg yolk before baking it comes out looking so golden and flaky, not greasy and looking/tasting like a toasted brown paper bag ...

What is so hard about making a white sauce for pot pie ?  I won't ever use canned soup again, it gave this dish an icky taste and texture.    Disappointing after making a home-made crust.

Okay, so I made this twice in two days because the family loved it so much! The first version I used condensed cream of chicken soup and frozen vegetables. It was delish. The second time I pre baked the bottom crust and mistakenly used plain, cream of chicken soup (not condensed). I didn't mention to my "tasters" but did notice a slightly, less runny, fuller and smoother interior. It had more loft and height. Someone can probably tell me why this is as I'm not sure of the different types of soup. We all loved this recipe but the second version edged out the first by a nose!

Really easy and delicious!!! Will make again. I added powdered garlic, salt and pepper to the filling. Used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of potato soup.  Instead of canned veggies I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies. Next time I will also add some onions.

For more flavor I used Montreal Chicken Seasoning; added small can of lima beans, left over green beans to the Veg-all.  This was a hit with my husband and grandsons.

This was very good.  My  husband really enjoyed it.  I made some changes.  I had a 9" pie plate.  I used 2 chicken breasts boiled in chicken broth and a little salt and pepper, 1.5 can cream of chicken (next time will use 2 cans), 1 pkg. of frozen vegetables cooked in chicken broth and drained.  Will definitely make again.  This is one of my husbands favorite meals.  Thanks for posting!

Wow, easy and delish!  Couple things I changed after reading reviews.  Used 2 cans of Cream of Chicken with Herbs.  Better flavor.  Also not a fan of canned veggies, so used a 12oz bag of frozen mixed veggies and diced a fresh zucchini.  Added 1/2 small onion diced and 2 teaspoons of fresh garlic.  The end result was AMAZING!  My husband could not stop raving about he flavors.  Will definitely be making this again.  PS. Used left over rotisserie chicken, breast, legs & thighs.  Worked out perfect!

This is a great chicken pot pie recipe made even better, IMO, by replacing one can of the cream of chicken with a cream of celery soup. Therefore you have one each and the celery adds some quick and easy flavor. I also make four batches at a time and freeze three unbaked so I have them on hand for busy days.

This turned out wonderful!  Like everyone else, i did change a few things--used only 1 1/2 cans of veggies, 3 chicken breasts and I replaced 1 can of cream of chicken soup with a can of cream of mushroom.  This chicken pot pie turned out very tasty and healthy! Huge plus in our house! :)

I made this the other night and it was really, really good.  My 7 year old claimed she did not want any.  I gave her a spoonful and she had seconds.  Very easy to make, and I will be making it again.

Delicious!  I only used 2 cans of vegetables and switched one of the soups to cream of potato.   Cooked bottom crust first too.  My husband has been asking for it daily.  Could not be easier to make but doesn't taste it!

I have made many variations of this recipe.  Depending on what I have, I've used various "cream of" soups.  I like the combination of chicken and celery the best.  I'm going to add garlic salt & pepper to the vegetables next time.  I usually use the pillsbury crust (2 per box). I love that crust. I've also baked this at 425, but it still takes about the same amount of time. You just have to cover the top after 1/2 hour so it doesn't get too brown.

This was great! I made the crust home-made and used only 3 chicken breasts. I also used herbed cream of chicken soup from Campbell's and boiled the chicken in chicken broth. It was definately a favorite at my house!

This was so delicious. My husband said it was every bit as good as Marie Calendars' pot pie, and that's a huge compliment from him. I used the cheapie frozen chicken breasts, but I rubbed them with olive oil, sage, kosher salt and pepper and roasted them. They added a lot of flavor to the pie. This will definitely become a family favorite.

This recipe was so easy and tasty. I used frozen mixed vegetables (cooked first)and leftover Christmas turkey. It was my first attempt at a pot pie and it was a success!

This is one of the easy, quickest and delicious chicken pot pie I have ever prepared.  I added thyme, a liitle curry powder, and black pepper.  I tried the pot pie with 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and also have tried it with cream of potato and cream of chicken the both turned out great.  I did add some milk to the mixture to thin it out a little. This is recipe is my family favorite.

This recipe was pretty easy and tasted good. My only change would be to use cressant rolls instead of the pie crust. The second crust was hard to get out of the pan. It tore while doing so. I also added a few extra seasonings like onion power and garlic salt. The family loved it. Thanks!

This was very easy!  It tasted great after we added some seasonings.  I did not have the size pie pan it said to use, so I used a 9x9 glass pan, it worked!  I did not use all of the veggie-soup mix, seemed like it would be too much for the amount of chicken, and it would not have all fit in the dish anyways.  All in all a great recipe, I will fix this again, soon!

This turned out great!  Everyone in my family actually ate it.  I sauteed onions with garlic while I cooked 2 chicken breasts on the electric grill and had a potato cooking in the microwave.  Then I added the 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 2 cans of mixed veggies.  I then cubed the potato and chicken and added to the rest of the mix.  I used two frozen pie shells that were 9 in and I had some left over... but we still ate that too!  It was really good, thanks!

very good! I boiled potatoes and carrots, used frozen peas and corn, chopped onion and celery. I only had 1 can of cr. of chicken soup so I subbed in cr. of mushroom. This was pretty good. Next time I think I'll try potato like some of the other reviewers. I also added some dried herbs and garlic salt. Could have added more salt. I was afraid on my first attempt to add too much. I used 1 ready made pie crust and topped it with a pastry sheet. Perfect!
I did have to extend the cooking time to about an hour. 
I will definitely make this one again.

I loved this recipe, I added some onion and used one can cream of mushroom soup and one can of water chestnuts for a little crunch. Was great on a cold day and my kids loved it. Definitely going to make it again and again on cold days.

This was easy to make and a real treat. I used frozen vegitables, and i covered the pie crust edges until the last 10 minutes. It was perfect. My whole family loved it! That in itself is an accomplishment.

I used frozen mixed veggies instead of canned, and 1 can cream of potato soup with 1 can cream of chicken. Finding recipes for my husband and 2 boys is difficult, but this was a huge hit!  No leftovers and they want to know when we're having it again!

I love the way a simple can of cream of chicken can make pot pie, dumplings, or a trillion other comfort foods. I used the pillsbury ready made pie crusts that you just unroll and fill. If the edges start to get too dark, cover with strips of aluminum foil. I only managed to get one sliver of this, my husband ate the rest of the pie!

I thought this was pretty good! I used the Pillsbury pie crust, frozen veggies, and added potatoes. I cubed one potato & put it all in the microwave for two minutes before adding it to the filling mix- nice addition. Great recipe- thanks!

This is really good and easy,  If you just want to make 1 pie you can use 1 can of soup and 1 large chick breast, and can of vegetables, do not drain them, makes the pie too dry.

Very yummy.  I'm not known as a good cook, but my husband was very impressed.  I will definitely make this again. I think this is one of those dishes that look complicated but really isn't.

This meal was so wonderful and easy!  I found that I only needed to use 2 cans of veggies instead of 3 and I also added some salt and pepper.  Thank You!  I will make it again!

It was easy to make. I felt like it was a bit bland and dry. So maybe I'll dry more condensed soup, salt & pepper next time.
