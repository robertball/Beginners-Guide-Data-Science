I was never a fan of Chicken A La King but my husband asked me to try making it. I added 2 T. dry sherry and used all chicken broth in place of the water. I also used evaporated milk for the milk. My husband doesn't like chicken breasts so I used boneless chicken thighs and I'm telling you all... it was fantastic!!! We truly loved this dish and it will be a regular on my weeknight table. Not only does it taste wonderful, comforting and homey, it's easy and quick! Thank you Colleen!

I have made this recipe for years but instead of the bell peppers I use small baby peas.  If you use the frozen variety you don't even need to defrost,  just place in mixture at the time you add the chicken.

I serve on Puff Pastry Shells which  you can find in the frozen food section of you supermarket.   I have also served on chow mein noodles or toast points.

This recipe freezes well as it makes plenty and can be defrosted on the stovetop or in the microwave.

Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe. I made some modifications to suit our tastes though. I added an 1/2 a cube of boullion(on top of what was called for) as it seemed to need that extra boost, also I left out the peppers and pimentos and added a cup of peas the last minute or so of cooking. WONDERFUL!!!!!

I made this recipe and my husband and I love it.  The only thing I changed was that I substituted chicken broth for the water and it was excellent!

Yes, this has always been a long-time family favorite of ours. I omitting the chopped pimento's & bell peppers and adding peas & carrots. I also used bouillon cubes instead of powder. I served this over buttermilk biscuits. Yummy!

My fiance and I LOVED this dish!  It was so yummy.  We used fresh mushrooms, but added a little chicken broth before the flour mixture for moisture and again at the end with the milk mixture in place of the reserve mushroom liquid.  Served over mashed potatoes, it was a SMASH!  Thanks!

This is really bland.  I think I'd rather use a recipe that has cream of mushroom soup instead of flour.  I had to double up on pepper just to give it some flavor.  I doubt I'll use this one again.

I used mixed veggies (carrot, peas, corn) instead of the peppers. I also dissolved the bouillon in the prescribed amount of water. Great dish, a hit for all concerned. Will definitely make it again.

This was hearty and tasty.  I did make some changes to suit my families taste.  I sauteed garlic and onions with the mushrooms and left out the green pepper and pimento.  I used chicken broth instead of water. I cooked it slowly and added some frozen peas and carrots at the end and served it over biscuits.  Just a few notes.  Once you add the flour, let this mixture cook over med/low heat.  This mixture should not get bubbly, but creamy. Cook it for a few minutes.  This will make sure the flour is cooked and not leave a raw taste. Make sure all liquids are added at room temperature. After you add the bouillon, water, milk and reserved mushroom liquid do not bring this mixture to a boil.  This makes the sauce thicker than it needs to be. Let it cook slowly until it gets to the consistency that you want.

~*~WONDERFUL~*~ I use to make this recipe all the time and then lost my copy of the recipe. I am so very glad that I found it once again, the exact same way I used to make it. Thankyou Colleen.

This was Delicious! I added just a touch of garlic powder and did what the recipe says to do exact. The only thing about this that i didnt like was the green bell peppers. The green peppers did not go well with this , so i ended up scooping the peppers out. Other than that, this was very creamy and good, i served over egg noodles and i would Not recommend it, the noodles dry it out and took away the creamyness of this dish, that was my fault though, i decided to try it with noodles and i shouldnt have...this is a great dish, i will make again for sure, thank you for sharing!

Easy and very good. I can not imagine leaving the pimentos or the green peppers out as others have suggested---it just would not be Chicken a la King without!  Next time I will try to cut back a little on the butter and use evaporated skim milk in place of regular milk in an attempt to spare some  fat calories and not loose the  rich flavor.

Great basic recipe!  I precooked my chicken, cubed it, set it aside.  Then I dumped the entire can of mushrooms, with liquid, in frying pan, diced onion and green pepper, garlic, 3 cubes chicken boullion, and sauteed.  Then added chicken back in, 3/4c flour, peas, and 1 can cream of chicken soup, just because that is the taste my family likes.  I also made biscuits and rice to go with.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have been making this recipe exactly as written for the 32 years of cooking for my hubby. Got it from my first cookbook as a married lady - Betty Crocker's. You can thin it a bit right before serving, but I don't.  I serve it over either rice or toast points. It has the traditional a la king flavor you expect.

This is a definite keeper! I did make just a few minor changes: Instead of chicken breasts, I used leftover chicken from a store bought rotisserie chicken that needed to be used up. I used fresh mushrooms in place of canned and I omitted the green pepper and pimentos completely as we are not huge fans of them. I added in about a cup of frozen pearl onions and a cup of a frozen vegetable mix (carrots, peas, corn and green beans) in about the last 5-7 minutes of cooking and also added about a teaspoon or so of a good italian herb blend. I served it over egg noodles and it was fantastic! I know it sounds like a lot of adjusting, but it was just a pinch here and a nudge there to suit our own personal taste buds....EXCELLENT and easy. From start to finish it took me 35 minutes!

This is a 5 star if you add the one ingredient that is missing from this.  Sherry!!!!  You must add at least 1 tbls. of sherry.  I serve this over white toast or rice (prefer the toast for this one) - or really make a thicker cream sauce out of this and use it as a filling for crepes.  Also, I never use water - replace that with milk. As others said, peas are also a nice addition.

So easy and so good.  I made it even easier by using a rotisserie chicken which added tons of flavor.  The extra salt from the rotisserie made it unecessary to add more bullion as some have indicated the recipe needed.  Thanks for the recipe.

very good,but why canned mushrooms when fresh are so much better.  I rarely ever use canned.  Subbed 6 oz fresh and sauteed til they release liquid.  Yummy !

I haven’t had Chicken a la King since I was a kid, but it sounded good, so I thought I’d give this recipe a try.  I’m glad I did.  I did make some modifications as other reviewers.  I didn’t use the green pepper, but did use a mix of peas and carrots, fresh mushrooms rather than canned, and I did add the pimentos.  Instead of bouillon powder and hot water, I used chicken broth and added a couple of extra tablespoons to compensate for the liquid from the canned mushrooms.  I also added a splash of sherry, which really elevates this.  I served it over hot biscuits and enjoyed a nice “comfort food” dinner.

Excellent!! I used chicken breasts (boneless and skinless) from freezer section in supermarket. I also added 1/2 cup frozen peas and 1/2 cup finely chopped celery. Bought the biscuits (Pillsbury) frozen and baked them ahead of time. Took no time at all to prepare. Very tasty. Could actually double recipe and freeze 1/2 for another time.

This is a great recipe! Don't change a thing! The green pepper, pimento and mushrooms are key. Ive been using the same one forever. Serve over rice or puffy pastry shells.

If I could give it 10 stars I would.  This was fabulous!  I used frozen mushroom in place of the canned and I substituted the hot water with hot potatoe water (water left from boiling potatoes).  It was so thick and creamy.  I also used canned chicken broth in place of the bouillon powder.  This is a real keeper!  Even the kids gobbled it up!

Wonderful and easy . I boil a small chicken-- less expensive-- and use broth instead of water.I also add chopped onion and garlic when I sautee the green pepper and mushrooms. My family requests this now it will always be a favorite. Thanks Colleen

Quick and easy.  Nice flavor.  I was worried that this would not have enough flavor but I'm glad I didn't add garlic or onion (which is what my instinct was telling me).  I did make some modifications though:  I used 4 large fresh stuffing mushrooms, 1 large red pepper instead of a green one, I only used 1 T of butter for sauteing, once everything was mixed I ended up using more flour as the sauce was not as thick as I like it,  used a can or chicken stock in place of the bullion+water, and only used 2 large chicken breast.  I served this over buttermilk biscuits which was interesting but I think I would have preferred whole wheat pasta.

As written I felt this was a little on the bland side but several different seasonings did the trick. In addition to the suggested vegies I also threw in leftover mixed vegetables I had in the fridge, made this with leftover chicken and served over leftover rice. It just doesn't get any easier than than that. Thank you Colleen!

If you want to look like a cook all-star with very little fuss, prepare this one!  Colleen, this is an awesome recipe.  Can you say, "Comfort food?"  I thought you could.  I didn't have this growing up at home, but it tastes like something my mom might have prepared.  I've had Chicken a la King in TV dinners before, but never again.  And those reviewers that recommended Peppridge Farms puff pastry shells are genius! And don't leave out the  pimentos!  The color will brighten your day.  What a meal, baby!

I liked it, the "pickies" (aka, family) didn't. However my Mom, who is a FANTASTIC cook said that it was delicious (what a compliment).  Thanks Colleen, ;)

One of the best I have made.  Rich, full flavored with a great body that will last for re-heating.

Same recipe I've been using for 20 years.   It's in the out of print Betty Crocker cookbook.  (the good one)  Our family loves it.

I'm not sure why you would use canned mushrooms rather than fresh. They have a strange texture and gave the dish a strange, artificial taste. We didn't care much for this recipe, seems like a cheap version of Chicken a la king. I'd advise finding a real recipe with sherry, peas, and real ingredients! Also we found that two chicken breasts was WAY too much chicken.

Perfect dinner and so very easy.  Fantastic on puff pastry.  I omitted green pepper (not a fan) and substituted frozen peas as suggested.  Just delicious and super quick.

I served it over puff pastry and it was a huge hit with my family!  Even my picky eater polished it all off, which is a big thing considering he "hates" mushrooms.  This recipe is a real keeper.

This was so easy and so good!  I used the frozen Peppridge Farms pastry puffs and sprinkled with pepper and they were beautiful to serve!  Low-fat butter and skim milk did not change the taste at all.  The pimentos are a must - it needs the color or else it looks like chicken soup.  I tried it once with canned chicken (I know - yuck! but I was in a hurry) and it was just DE-LISH!  I am going to make it again soon.

Chicken a la King is one of my favorite recipes,i resorted to this when i couldn't find my version, which i found right as i went to make it. My Version: I do not like mushrooms at all so when i make this, i use a half of a cup of fresh red and green peppers chopped fairly small. I also use a 1/4 of a cup of fresh white mushrooms diced small. I sauteed them in a 1/2 cup of butter until they are soft, i then remove from heat and mix in a cup of flower, 1tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp of ground pepper. I put back on light heat and simmer until bubbly making sure to stir it constantly so it doesn't scorch. I think keep it on low heat and add 2 cups of chicken broth, and 2 cups of cream, keep on low heat stirring constantly until it come to a boil again, then add your chicken, cook until chicken is heated through. If it seems to thin you can add more flour to thicken it up. I like my thicker as i serve it in  puff pastries. With the mushrooms diced so small you still add some flavor that way, but you cant taste them at all!

We made this tonight. We used fresh portabella mushrooms, used some of our homegrown red pepper with the green pepper, chicken stock instead of water and used half and half in place of milk as we had some we needed to use. Delicious.

I made this for the first time - based on your feedback I substituted chicken broth for the water, and used lactose-free milk as I have some lactose intolerant folks in my house.  I also 'stir fried' the chicken with onions and some personal spices before adding them with the other ingredients.  The fam loved it!  It's a keeper and we'll be having it again!!

We found this to be a perfect blend of flavors and didn't/won't change a thing.  It is comfort food from our just married days when 2 or 3 meals a week were served on toast.

Awesome recipe I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon, added canned peas drained (not a big bell pepper fan), and fresh mushrooms. Sauce was excellent consistency and tasted great. Thanks

Very good recipe. I haven't made chicken ala king in years and was looking for a refresher course. I used a 10oz bag of frozen peas and mushrooms (in place of the red pepper) and 1 can of mushroom stems and pieces. I cut the butter down to 6T (not much, I know, but 1/2 c just seemed like too much). I stirred 1 pod of condensed chicken stock into the hot water instead of bullion. I served over pastry puffs. de-LISH!

My Mom used to make this for me when I was a kid. She's fold white bread slices into muffin tins and over toast them, making "crowns", and then ladle the chicken ala king into the crowns. Ahhh memories :-)

This is REALLY good!  Per the suggestion of other reviewers, I threw in some peas (cuz I like 'em) and a little bit of cooking sherry (instead of the reserved mushroom juice).  Fabulous!

Seriously delicious comfort food!  With real butter, it's over the top; with better-for-you type butter, it's still good. The time-consuming  part is taking the turkey off the bone, esp. if I can't enlist hubby to do it; well worth the effort though and it always turns out great.

I had never had this before and decided to try it.  My first impression is that it is similar to chicken pot pie.  I cooked it with noodles, but I think it would be better over biscuits.

Made as directed except used chicken stock in place of water. Bland until I added a lot more salt and pepper, plus a pinch of spice from Penzy's called Balti.  Very good weeknight meal with leftovers for lunches the next day.

Thanks for the formula!!

For those who thought the taste was bland, add a 1/2 tsp of each of these spices: ground cumin, chili powder and paprika.

I actually use this recipe as a base for chicken pot pie.  Take the instructions for the sauce and add corn and green beans and peas instead of bell peppers and put it in a pie crust.  Simply amazing.

I, like others, used peas and carrots. I used chicken thighs and used all chicken broth, no water. My hubby doesn't like mushrooms, so it ended up tasting a lot like Chicken and dumplings, but delicious just the same!! I served over biscuts and everyone enjoyed it. I made a double batch and froze some for another night. I am looking forward to it!

This was a great basic recipe, although I did make some changes.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with Montreal chicken seasoning and baked them.  I used fresh mushrooms, yellow/orange/red peppers instead of green, and added some onion and garlic to all of that with the butter.  I subbed chicken broth for the bouillon and water, left out the pimento and added about a cup of frozen peas.  Served with broad noodles.

I made this recipe last night, followed the advice of many other reviewers and added half a chopped onion, 2 Tbsp.chicken boullion and disolved this in the hot water, omitted the green pepper, added 2 Tblsp. sherry, frozen carrots and peas, plus I omitted the salt, I didn't think it was needed and it sure wasn't missed. I also used 6 chicken breasts because that is what I had on hand. It came out fantastic. Took a little longer to prepare then I had hoped but the sauce thickened up quick. My husband loved it. The recipe made enough for us to have it for dinner for three nights and neither of us minded at all.

I used leftover turkey. I had planned to serve it over cornbread like my mom used to - but I ran out of milk. The egg noodles were good, but there's nothing like ala king over good cornbread. Skip the green peppers. I used fresh mushrooms along with the canned - I had leftover. I was a little bland and I had to add salt at the table. I'll make again with turkey or chicken - but it needs the cornbread. A sauteed onion might be a nice addition if you like a little more zip to your meal.

Comfort food just like chicken a la king should taste except it should be peas instead of green pepper.  I used butter flavored Birds Eye frozen peas and left the butter out altogether.  It was more buttery than sauce than real butter could make it and much less fat and calories.

This was so good!I took the suggestions of others  & replaced the water with chicken broth &  evaporated milk for the reg. milk.I also sauteed the chicken breast in light olive oil seasoned with alittle salt,black pepper & garlic powder.I also added a small chopped onion in with the green pepper & mushrooms.I didn't have bouillon powder so I heated the broth & dissolved the cubes in it.Even my husband who hates mushrooms loved this.He didn't even take the time to pick out the mushrooms! Thanks for sharing!

Delish and easy!!   The changes that I made:  I used left over turkey, used both red and greeen peppers and didn't use the pimento.  It also froze well and I just needed to add a little more chicken broth when I reheated.

This was very good.  I didn't use green bell pepper and I customized the quantity to five and found that I needed more liquid, so I added more milk to thin a bit.  Might use frozen baby peas next time, but overall it was just what we wanted and I have saved it for futue use.

This was a huge hit in our house even with our 3 small children.  A family favorite.  I did modify the recipe by omitting the mushrooms, peppers and pimentos and adding 1/2 to 3/4 of a bag of frozen mixed veggies.

Very nice recipe!  Before adding chicken and pimento, I added in a packet of turkey gravy mixed with water.  I think it improved the flavor.  Hubby and daughter really enjoyed it served over basmati rice!  I will be making this again.

This recipe was a complete and total hit in my home.   Instead of using bread or toast in this recipe, I used puff pastry shells.  This added a little more elegance and made the flavor over the top!  Definitely recommend this one!

The first time I made this, it turned out a little too salty and bland.  The second time it was better - used no salt since I figured the bouillon powder was salty enough.  And since I don't like peppers, they were omitted both times.  Nobody missed them.

Very good dish.  The sauce had a really good mushroom flavor.  I made it with leftover roasted chicken. I use it as a base in other recipes instead of canned cream soups.  My fiancé loves it!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will definitely make again! (:

This Chicken a la King was as good as the reviewers said.  I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce but poached chicken pieces (primarily dark meat) and took the meat off the bone.  (Wish recipes would specify amount of chicken and not just say for example "4 chicken breasts" -- I think I ended up with about 4, possibly even 5 or 6,cups of chicken meat (even I didn't measure, ha!) and so doubled the sauce.  It was the right decision. Used the broth from cooking the chicken instead of boullion and hot water.  Used fresh mushrooms, garlic, onions, carrots, peas, and sweet pointed red pepper instead of green pepper and pimiento. Used fresh thyme and some dried mixed herbs along with salt and pepper.  DELICIOUS!  Once I'd chopped the veg and cooked the chicken, making the dish itself was easy.  I did the chicken the day before and chopped the veg early in the day, so it all seemed a breeze.  We had it on toast -- I think I would love it on mashed potatoes, so will do that next time.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great recipe for when you need some comfort food and you have leftover chicken.  Sometimes I add a can of chicken broth in place of the chicken bouillon and hot water.  I love this because there is no cream of chicken soup in it!

Delicious and easy.  I used fresh mushrooms, gr and red pepper, baby carrots and half the chicken.  This recipe made a fantastic sauce to hold it all together.  My huband and I both loved it!  Thank you Colleen:).

I can't believe I've never had Chicken a la King before, but this was my first time.  My family really enjoyed this dish!  Made it almost exactly as written except that I didn't have a green pepper, so I used green peas, instead.  Also added a sliced onion and some fresh garlic with the mushrooms.  I spilled my reserved mushroom liquid, so I added a second can.  Served over rice.  Delicious comfort food.

This took a lot longer to make than I had originally thought it would. I used different veggies (what I had) and it turned out pretty good, though there was a strong veggie to chicken ratio in favour of the veggies. I used less water to make a bit of a thicker sauce. Next time I would chop the chicken differently- my pieces were too big and too few. 
Overall a good recipe and would use again, just nothing super fantastic.

This was AMAZING!!!!  I decided to make this because a lot of the reviewers said their picky eaters loved it, I have picky eaters and they gobbled it up!  I didn't use green peppers, I used peas, I also used chicken broth rather then the water and bullion.  I served it over biscuits for my husband and I and served it over egg noodles for my kids!  BIG HIT!  This will be a regular in our house!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I substituted frozen mixed veg. for the mushrooms, peppers and pimento only because of one family members dislike of the latter. Also I used chicken broth in place of the water as other reviewers suggested and added about 3/4 tsp. of sweet paprika. I had a recipe I used years ago for Chicken a la king that called for paprika. I've since lost that recipe but with the addition of paprika this one comes pretty darn close. This recipe was very good and my son who was skeptical at first suggested I make it often. Thanks for an easy, economical and tasty dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my family. I didnt have pimento. I added some frozen veggie mix that had bell pepper, zucchini, onion and asparagus and it was really tasty.  This recipe does not need a lot of work to make it taste good - I served it over biscuits and it was a winner!

Made this today with following changes:  used fresh mushrooms, red bell pepper (didn't have green), chicken broth instead of hot water...everything else was the same.  Served it on mashed potatoes. My  husband and I thought it was just mediocre, but our friend loved it.  Chicken a la King is a very simple dish, but this was definitely not the best we've tasted.  Would not make this recipe again...sorry.

Comfort food. Simple and easy to prepare. I used some left over chicken and added peas, carrots, and 1 tablespoon of Sherry served over rice. Left over next day over toast.

I was looking for a chicken a la king recipe because my fiance likes it and I stumbled upon this. I changed it up a bit and omitted the green pepper and pimento, subbing frozen mixed veggies and using fresh mushrooms and adding a chopped onion. I used chicken broth instead of water and threw in some extra spices to give it some more flavor but it was still a bit bland.  Anyway, it was still yummy over fresh biscuits!

I grew up eating CALK so this recipe helped me  get it just right. Like the other reviews I use peas no bell peppers ,fresh mushrooms,pimento, my mom always added chopped boiled eggs . To cut time I bought an already cooked roticery chicken  I dont chop up the chicken I tear it from the bone ,the breast meat is pulled apart so its kinda shredded and liquid boxed chicken broth. We eat it over garlic toast

I used a cup of peas instead of the green pepper, used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I also used fresh mushrooms and doubled them up and used a chopped onion cooked with the mushrooms to start.  It was very good.

So Great! I had been using another recipe for Chicken a la King and this one has much more flavor! The only thing I will change for next time is omitting the canned mushrooms for fresh ones. My husband doesn't like the texture of mushrooms out of a can. But we loved this recipe! Thank you!

Really good, I used chicken stock instead of water, fresh mushrooms saute'd with butter, red peppers and a small amount of minced onion and celery. I added peas and pimento and served over biscuits.

This is an excellent recipe. If mushrooms are an issue, I omit them and use diced fresh carrots and frozen peas instead. I slice a clove of garlic and saute it and the carrots together. I use prepared chicken broth instead of the hot water and granules. The green pepper is reduced to 1/8 of a pepper and then 1/8 of a red pepper. I serve it on buttermilk biscuits or puff pastry. It's always a hit!

This was the best. I did follow some reviewers' suggestions  Added chopped onion and used fresh mushrooms and red pepper rather than canned mushrooms and green pepper. Added a splash of sherry to the sauce right before serving. Also used leftover turkey breast from the night before rather than chicken. Served over split "Feather Light Biscuits" also from this site. The perfect comfort food. We inhaled it!

YUM!  Super recipe, and SO easy!  I used a red pepper in place of green, which I find too bitter. I also added an onion and used fresh mushrooms, and added white wine to replace the juice from the tinned mushrooms.  
I used this sauce for leftover turkey from Christmas and served with brown rice...A dinner party-worthy recipe!

Yummy!  I used fresh, sliced mushrooms and sauteed them in a little canola oil with some diced onion and a little minced garlic.  I added 1/4 cup of light margarine before I added the flour, which made a paste but didn't bubble.  Then I added 2 cups of warmed fat-free, low sodium chicken broth and a can of evaporated skim milk.  I substituted peas for the green peppers and added chicken seasoning at the table.  Served with linguini noodles and everyone loved it.

I omitted the green peppers and doubled the recipe. At the end when you add the chicken, I added a 16 oz bag of frozen peas and carrots. I also threw in some garlic powder and minced onion and onion salt, along with celery salt (I like spices). It was     a huge success. was planningon having some to freeze, but had to boil more noodles so we could eat it. Needless to say, we didn't have enough left to freeze. definitely a keeper recipe.

Wish I could give it more than five stars.  I did add some cooked (frozen) peas and a tablespoon of sherry.  I omitted the green pepper and mushrooms because one child is a picky eater.  Everyone loved it.  Will make again.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I use it often and it always turns out.  I have toddlers who don't like to eat protein because of the texture and I've found that they love this when I will exchange the chicken breats for 1 or 2 (13oz) cans of chicken. (It is more like shredded chicken).  Thanks for a wonderfully quick and easy meal Colleen!

Very good and easy!  The only changes I made were to add 1/4 C. finely chopped onion at the beginning and to deglaze the pan with 1 T. sherry before adding flour.  I served it over puff pastry shells the first night, and the leftovers over toast.  It was good both ways.

This was really good and made a hit with my family when I used the leftover turkey in it. I will definitely make it again. I had to add a little water at the end to thin the sauce. Sodium content can be reduced by using low-sodium bouillon and no-salt-added mushrooms.

I make this quite often ... the end result is a lot of chicken in a richly flavored "gravy" that lends itself to a mild accompaniment such as rice, noodles, puff pastry shells, biscuits, etc.
I agree with others that it benefits from the addition of peas (about a half cup of frozen peas). I also agree that dry sherry is a must ... but a little goes a long way. I start with a teaspoon, taste, and add from there. I always grate just a bit of nutmeg over a cream sauce as well.
I do not agree with substituting broth or stock instead of bouillon powder. Bouillon is considerably saltier, and again, the sauce needs to be intensely flavored to season the chicken and accompaniment. I bet the reviewers claiming this dish is bland made such a substitution . For a thicker application, I use evaporated milk. Adding some cooked diced potatoes and maybe some frozen corn would make it substantial enough to bake in a pie. Yum. A solid recipe is one that can stand alone or be tweeked in different directions, and this fits the bill.

This is a good "starter" recipe.  I took the easier way and thickened with cornstarch when it was all put together (the last 1/2 cup of milk)and it worked out fine.  But I also had to DOUBLE the chicken bouillon granules to get any decent chicken flavor from the gravy.  As far as the veggies, I went according to the recipe, but added about 1/2 of an onion diced also, and a tad bit of garlic powder for flavor.  But as others have posted, peas would be good too in place of the green pepper, it seems you can kind of "play" with this one.  All and all it was really good.

This is very good, and so easy to make.  I left out mushrooms because of allergies, but otherwise kept it the same...except for adding a shake of garlic powder.  Served over noodles.  This will be one of my go to recipes.

Very good I used chicken broth instead of water and used the Amish chicken paste instead of the bouillon. Didn't care for the pimento in it tho. Will use frozen peas next time.

This brought back memories of eating this as a kid.  I used fresh mushrooms and left out the instant bouillon and used chicken stock in place of the water.  And added some frozen peas at the end when I added the chicken and served over egg noodles. The whole family liked this.

I used a  Costco roasted chicken  instead of breasts.  I used chicken broth instead of water. I added the 2 Tablespoons of sherry that one person recommend .I followed  the recipe beside the mentioned changes. I made pills bury grand biscuits  to put it on.  My husband said I should make it again.  I loved it and it was easy.

Husband and young son loved this.  Served over potato rolls purchased at the bakery.  Threw in just a few peas.  Also NOTE:  freezes excellently, so make some now, throw some in the freezer, have it again next week.

Someone at work mentioned Chicken a la King and I just had to make it. She gave me a recipe and it was practically identical to this one. I couldn't resist using peas in mine and mushrooms were fresh not canned. I'll always remember how this wonderful meal sustained me during the week long power outage after the NE blizzard / Feb '13.

I'd never had Chicken A La King before, but my husband kept asking for it, so I used this recipe. I have to say this was absolutely DELICIOUS! It is creamy, chickeny goodness with a delicate flavor. I read the past reviews and added 1 T of dry sherry (because a previous reviewer recommended it).  I had to omit the mushrooms because I didn't have any in the house, but did add 1 cup of peas because my son loves them. I really appreciate the fact that there are only natural ingredients in the recipe. I'd definitely make it again.

Would have been way too bland as written.  Added diced onion, garlic, and fresh mushrooms, frozen peas, sea salt, cayenne pepper, and paprika.  Used chicken stock in place of water.  Served over biscuits.

Very good recipe. I added some sliced up celery and carrots, some garlic, and used chicken broth instead of water. Served it over "Fluffy Biscuits" from this site, and it made a very nice meal, with plenty left over that I froze for another meal.

Very fail safe, I added 1/2 white onion, 1/2 red pepper, cremini mushrooms, no canned mushrooms, pimento or green pepper.  Oh then I added a pinch of red pepper flakes!  Mmmmm...good!

Rather than use the chicken breasts, I cooked a whole chicken (which we raised on our farm) and used the meat both white and dark.
I sauteed a fresh red pepper, fresh mushrooms and sweet Vadalia onion in butter.  I blended the chicken into this mix and folded it into the cream sauce.
Also used chicken broth in lieu of water which gave it much more flavor.
Made homemade biscuits and served this over them.  Delicious doesn't begin to describe this very comforting food!

I was a little worried about making this.  To me, a child of the 60's, Chicken a la King consisted of two cans taped together and when ready mixed together.  I really can't eat water chestnuts to this day!  I added the sherry and it was great.  Thank you for submitting.

This was comfort food at it's best.  The only thing that wasn't comforting about it was the fact that it felt like it was more work than I was wanting to do the night I cooked it.  It really wasn't bad, though.  Still a quick, tasty recipe!

Excellent and fast to make. I used real mushrooms and added peas from the can. Instead of milk I used cooking cream and less flour. I will surely make this again as it was a great hit.

I love this so much. This recipe makes a huge amount, so if it's just for you I would suggest cutting it by at least half - or plan to be eating it for the rest of the week.

I use fresh mushrooms and veg stock instead of the bouillon and reserved mushroom water, whole wheat flour, and serve it over brown rice and it is wonderful. Basically put in as many vegetables as you want, and it's great (I like red bell pepper, peas, chopped baby carrots etc..). I also add a little bit of whatever spice I have handy to up the flavor a little bit.

I just made this tonight and wanted to tell you how fabulous and EASY this recipe is!   I left out the mushrooms as my son doesn't like them and as other reviewers said, I used all chicken bouillion in place of the water.   I also added peas, carrots and corn at the end , instead of the green peppers and pimento.  It is absolutely delicious  and will use this recipie for my chicken pot pies from now on too. 

thank you for sharing this - ALL my picky eaters LOVED it!

Good basic recipe for a la king. As with any recipe, it's necessary to taste and season each layer. I wound up adding a little cayenne and hot sause to pick it up a little. And no savory dish is complete without onion and garlic, so I sauteed some with the pepper and mushrooms.

We decided to try this on a whim.  I LOVE CALK, but have never made it before.  This tasted so yummy!  Like most people, I put in peas, but mainly because that is how I had it growing up.  Great recipe!

The recipe is very good as-is! It has a great consistancy and will thicken the longer it cooks. I often substitute  canned mushrooms for fresh, add frozen veggies, use cream of mushroom soup and/or omit the  pimentos depending on what I have on hand. I always serve this with tea biscuits for a hearty dinner.

I was looking for a recipe I normally use and couldn't find it, so I decided to try this one. I had to change up the ingredients a bit to make it a little more healthy or based on what I had in the house. I used low fat dairy and small diced red peppers for the pimentos. I used no sodium powdered broth powder and left out the black pepper, because I don't care for it. It seemed like it was misssing something, but it may have been because I lightened it up. Chicken a la king is one of those recipes that really benefits from good rich butter. It worked good though, for a quick dinner today, to use up some leftover cooked chicken I had in the house.

Really good dinner! I found that I needed to add about a cup of liquid (mix of chicken stock and milk) to get the final product as creamy as I wanted it, but thicker may be just what others are looking for so I'm not knocking stars off for that. I don't think that this could serve 7, though--unless they are the world's smallest servings. I had to scrape and scrimp on my last 2 servings to feed my family of 5--not sure where the other 2 would have come from!

This turned out pretty good.  I did add poultry seasoning, extra pepper, extra bullion, a little salt and a small can of peas.  We still thought it was kinda bland (but then, comfort food IS kinda bland.)  Next time I may try a can of cream of chicken soup and less flour and water.

What a great tasting dish that can be served many ways. I used fresh mushrooms and didnt have pimentos on hand. Served over rye toast with cranberry sauce. Would be great over wide noodles or rice.

This has the right ingredients to make it the way I remember it. Used fresh mushrooms and maybe a third of the butter and flour, but I always cut down on the butter. I braised the chicken with the peppers and added a little sherry. Served over brown rice.

I sauteed 8oz fresh green beans and 1lb of fresh mushrooms in a butter-EVOO mix.  Then proceeded to step 2, putting 1/2c butter in a fresh saucepan.  No pimentos (only because I didn't have them).  Not a fan of cooked green pepper OR canned mushrooms, so hence my changes.  Very tasty gravy.

For so long I looked for a good recipe to replace the Chicken a la King my mother used to make, and this turned out to be absolutely perfect! Chicken a la King is my comfort food. It gives me that warm, happy feeling inside and this recipe did it for me. My long search is over!

I made this as is and again with some changes. With my changes, it was 5-star. However, I'm starring based on the original recipe.  Most good cooks know to never used canned vegetables and so, I used fresh mushrooms (doubled) sauted in chicken broth.  Also, instead of water, I used chicken broth which is an obvious substitute that improved the flavor dramatically. I took the bouillon down to 1/2 teaspoon.  Lastly, I added garlic and substituted the salt for celery salt. Absolutely wonderful.

This is a good recipe. I usually use whatever I have on hand for chicken a la king and this this time I used peas instead of green pepper and pimiento.  We also had lots of hard boiled eggs left over from Easter so we stuck those in there.  It was actually yummy!

This was good, but SALTY!  I had to add more milk/water to make it less salty.  Otherwise, it was good.  I used peas instead of the green bell pepper and canned chicken.  Good, but will omit all the salt next time.

I read several chicken a la king recipes and I was looking for something basic but something I could tweak too. This was perfect for my tweaking. I used 1/2 green bell, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 sweet onion, and added frozen peas and corn. I also substituted chx broth instead of boullion. It was so YUMMY. Ultimate comfort food. I served it over rice and my roommate devoured it.

This is an okay recipe, in my opinion. I had a lot of trouble following it the way it's written -- very confusing. I made quite a few substitutions and I served this with puff pastry. A great use for leftover chicken!

Excellent recipe but I did do a change and I hope it helps others, I did substitute leftover1 cup of chicken gravy for the 1/2 cup of butter, saute'ed carrots instead of the red peppers as I did not have any, added 1/2 cup of sherry added frozen peas and green onion at the last minute.  The result was fantastic.  I served it over three colored rotini noodles and a side of spinach salad, and spanikopita and dilled fresh tomatoes.  The dinner party was a hit.

Quick and easy and very tasty!  I used peas instead of green pepper and only a few TBS butter and flour because I wasn't making a whole lot.  Also, using chicken broth was extra easy instead of plain water and bouillon powder.  Oh, and a good dash of sherry.....traditional to ala king.  Will make again when I can't think of anything else to do with leftover chicken.

Mmmmm- just like my Nanna used to make. I served it over buttered rice, and it was the comfort food supreme.

I love this recipe and will be adding it to my rotation! I substituted peas for green peppers and omitted the piminetos,since I didn't have any on hand. I served over rice, but next time I will try the puff pastry as someone else suggested; I think it would be a great dinner party recipe!

Used fresh mushrooms, leftover chicken, omitted pimento since I didn't have any and served over white rice cooked in chicken broth for some added flavor.  Yum!

Although I liked this recipe, and it worked great with leftover turkey, I found it a little on the bland side especially when served over rice. In my family, we've always served this dish over Mashed Potatoes. Good comfort food, but my husband wasn't nuts about it.

This was very good. I made a few mods. Used leftover lemon pepper chicken breasts chopped, a can of evap milk in place of milk, red pepper instead of green, fresh chopped mushrooms instead of canned and added 1/2 a chopped onion. I also used 3 chicken bullion cubes instead of the powder, it was a little too much, I should have used just 1 and it wouldn't have been as salty. This is a great basic recipe, next time I'll omit the peppers and use frozen peas. Might even be good with a bit o' sour cream :)
Serve with Kentucky biscuits recipe from this site and you'll be in comfort food heaven :)

Very good. The only thing different I did was use heavy cream instead of milk and fat free low sodium chicken broth instead of the bullion and water. The only other suggestion I have is should be served with rice. Noodles don't do it justice. JMTC

This is wonderful! I put it over herbed biscuits and everyone was asking when we would be having it again. I did it again the next week, again over biscuits but without the herbs, it was very good but from know on I will add the herbs. They just gave it a lttle extra yum.

This is a great base that can be modified to your taste! I omitted the veges called for....I chopped chicken breasts up and satuteed it with onion and the butter as called for....when the chicken was almost cooked I added the flour to the chicken and onion mixture and cooked it just a bit longer before adding the milk, water and bouillion. (Kind of similar to when you make biscuits and gravy) Let it thicken a bit then threw in some frozen peas and carrots and served it over biscuits....comfort food!

This is a favorite recipe.  I skip the bell pepper and add peas.  I only use 2 chicken breasts and serve over puff pastry.  I substitute roasted red pepper for the pimento.

Very good.  Followed some suggestions and omitted green pepper and added peas and carrots and 1/2 cup onion to make it more kid friendly.  Also added 2T. cooking sherry to sauce.  Yummy over puff pastry shells or toast.

Very good and so easy.  I made a few changes - I use fresh mushrooms, or reconstituted dried instead of canned.  Instead of the green pepper I saute onions and add frozen peas and diced fresh carrots.  Instead of the chicken boullion I use a chicken base which is a paste and I think it has a richer flavor. I have even made it with canned chicken  which makes it really easy and quick.

Good 1st time, but remade it this time w/o pimento and even better. Added a full chopped yellow onion. Tweaked salt and pepper somewhat. Would probably reduce flour next time, so not so thick. Also this time served over rice instead of noodles. Think overall family preferred rice. Otherwise great!

I give this 5 stars after I modified the recipe with the recommendations of other reviewers.  I sauteed a medium chopped onion with the bell pepper and mushrooms.  I used 2 TBSP total of chicken bouillon powder which I mixed into the hot water to make chicken broth and I added an additional 2 TBSP of dry sherry.  I didn't omit any of the recipe's original ingredients.  I served it over a mixture of white and brown rice and it was delicious!

It was alright.  It was missing something... even after changing it up a bit it still lacked something in taste.  But, if you like bland food, this could be the one for you.

Everyone loved it (even my finicky 2 1/2 year old).  I sauted the green pepper in a little olive oil first.  I also used reduced fat margarine.  Since I doubled the recipe, I only used about 1 stick plus 3 more tablespoons.  When I tasted it the first night, I thought it was OK.  Luckily, it was for the next 2 days.  It was FANTASTIC after sitting in the fridge (and allowing the flavors to combine).  Thanks for sharing.

The buttery sauce is delicious/very rich.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas instead of bell pepper to make it more "kid-friendly" and served it over the most nutritious bread (toasted) that I could buy.  Everyone enjoyed the meal!

This is a great way to use leftover chicken! I didn't have but a breast & 1/2 of chicken, I used frozen peas instead of bell pepper & I was out of pimento so I subbed some roasted red pepper...which I think really kicked the flavor up a notch. I forgot to add the mushroom liquid (was preoccupied trying to make me another  martini ;o) ) but I did add  a little more chicken boullion granules. I also greatly decreased the butter (probably by half) which wasn't quite enough to make a roux but the flour coated the mushrooms & peas well & once I added the liquids, it all worked out in the end. Served it on top of rice....simple meal but very tasty.

This is a keeper.  I added 1 cup of peas as well, and it turned out great.  I served it over Eggo waffles (chicken & waffles is a local dish).  We had guests over & they were literally scraping the pan to get the last of it out for not seconds, but thirds.  Thanks for the great recipe, Colleen.

This recipe is awesome!!  I had some frozen mixed veggies, so I steamed those and I added rice to the finished product to make it really hearty. I also used evaporated milk and chicken broth (from the cubes).  I served this over biscuits.  This is comfort food.

I found this recipe to be quite boring. I followed the recommendations of reviewers and halved the butter, added a little onion, peas, no salt, a little white wine, and substituted broth for the water. Still, it was unexciting. I can see where children might enjoy it.

this was very yummy.  I added 1 chopped onion and 3 chopped celery.  I also boiled and de-boned a whole chicken instead of frozen chicken breasts.  That way you can use the broth for extra flavor.  Another flavor trick, use 1 can of condensed cream of chicken/mushroom soup.  My kids loved this dish.  I served it over jumbo oven rise biscuits.

Good for a cold rainy day. I grew up with this, and four generations of my family have loved it, especially served in patty shells. I omit the green pepper and pimento, and add a touch of curry powder, enough to add some depth to the flavor, without making it a curry. Toasted almond slices or slivers are delicious on top.

I made this with a few changes based on what I had in the house and it worked well. First, I used half the butter because the amount seemed excessive (turned out fine like that). I sauteed onion, carrot, and celery with the mushrooms. Instead of water and bullion, I used my homemade chicken broth. I added herbs de provence for flavor and I ended up thinning out the sauce with more broth at the end. When I added the chicken, I added frozen peas as well. 
 Overall, we liked this dish.

I make this with a Costco rotisserie chicken.  I strip the meat and make stock from the rest of it.  I use the stock instead of water and bullion.

I also add poultry seasoning to taste, probably 1/2 teaspoon. 

I also use whatever vegetables I have.  Most of the time it's peas, carrots & corn.  But anything can work.

It was pretty.good. My husband loved it. I tweeked it a little by using green and red peppers. I omitted the pimentos. And served it over rice. I don't think I'll make it again. But that doesn't mean it's not a great recipe. Just not for me.

to say that i made this dish using this recipe wouldn't be completely truthful. i followed some of the steps and used most of the ingredients, but it had some serious deficiencies that i had to fix.

first, as others have said, no canned mushrooms for me. i'm not a fan of them anyway, so there's no way i'm adding mushy mushrooms to the dish. sliced some fresh bellas that i sauteed with onion, garlic and celery.

second, i've never seen chicken a la king without peas. ever. instead of adding broth and cream at the same time, i added broth (not water) once the flour had browned and brought that mixture to a boil at which point i added frozen peas. once the peas were about done, i added heavy cream and the chicken.

as far as seasoning goes, since this is a white sauce, i used white pepper along with salt and a dash of mrs dash.

end result: a bowl of unsurpassed creamy goodness

This turned out great! I actually used almond flour instead of regular to add some more protein, and some mixed frozen vegetables I had (corn, carrots, green beans). I added 2 tsp bouillon instead of 1 1/2, and I read the ingredient list wrong originally and bought pimento cheese instead of a pimento pepper, but went ahead and added 2 tbsp of pimento cheese after realizing the mistake. It was a great addition!!

I know this wont be a true rating because I had to use fresh ingredients in place of some of the canned.   But end result was 5 stars!..I actually had started to make something else and was making mashed potatoes, so I finished them and served this Chicken sauce over it....It really wound up being a 5 star dinner despite all my mis steps, lol

This sauce is wonderful. We served it over rice for my husband and over noodles for us. I did add a bag of peas and carrots because it's the only way I can get vegetables in him. It turned out great.

I tossed it with some al dente spaghetti.   Wanted fetuccini  but didn't have any.   Very very good for left over Costco Rotisserie chicken.   And Costco Grilled peppers (red and yellow).

This has always been a great recipe website.

Made this once. It was a bit bland, but quickly figured out it was because there was too much butter. So, I made it again but instead of the whole stick of butter, I just used half a stick. With this, after adding in the flour, the flour is all immediately absorbed by the butter and so requires no boiling after being added. Can just go straight to adding all the liquids and seasoning. It's very flavorable. I love it.

This is pretty good. We had left over chicken to use up and I came across this recipe. We stuck to the recipe and also added  sweet onion, garlic, peas and carrots. We like our veggies. We used chicken broth and 2% milk. It turned out real thick and creamy. This is a great recipe that you can tweak to your liking. We ate ours with noodles. I think next time we make this we will try it with biscuits. Thank you. We'll be making this again!

Savory A La King.  Used olive oil and cooked the mushrooms and green peppers longer than recommended and by accident cut back on the water by 1/8th of a cup.  We also skipped the noodles and used puff pastry shells for a more elegant appearance.  Topped that off with a dash a paprika.  We prefer the pastry shells because I always found noodles to be too gummy.  Loved the taste and will continue to make this.  Thanks so much

Looking at the photo, there are green peas in the dish, which we enjoy, but the peas are NOT listed in the ingredients unless I missed it.  The green pepper not so much a favorite.
Changes: a couple tablespoons of sherry. Also, a good shake of Adobo or Cajun seasoning.  I will make it again, served over hearty egg noodles.

It turned out great. We don't like bell pepper so I used green chili. I served it over mashed potatoes.  It's one of my faves but  my granddaughters don't like it as much as I do. I used left over chicken.

I used this recipe as a guideline.  Nixed the green pepper, and used chicken stock.  Served it on Kluski brand egg noodles.  They are more like homemade and have a rough texture that holds on to the sauce.  Kluski noodles are only available north if the Mason Dixon line.

This was so good my husband, who hates chicken, asked for seconds! Easy one dish meal! Everyone wins! I did add a little extra bouillon and used chicken stock instead of water. This will now be in my regular rotation.

This is a wonderful version of a classic recipe.  Leave out the peppers and pimentos and you just have a different chicken casserole.  I will be making this over and over.

I made a gluten free version by using cornstarch instead of flour, and I cooked the rice using chicken broth for more flavor. My husband loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

Used chicken thighs and mixed frozen veggies. Omitted the shrooms, green pepper and pimento. Instead of bouillion powder, I used the concentrated OXO stuff. It’s a favourite around here!!

My husband loved it! I made a few changes that others had suggested. I used an orange bell pepper and I didn’t have pimento so I chopped a few scallions and some celery I had and added those instead. I only used about 6 tablespoons of butter instead of 8 and added a couple of tablespoons of dry sherry. Rotisserie chicken breasts work great and at the end I threw in some frozen peas. I did need to add a little additional milk because it came out a little too thick. I usually try to follow exactly the first time I make something, but so many of the comments suggested the sherry and peas. It was very good served with biscuits and rice. I also added more black pepper than called for only because we like it.

Husband loved it and it was easy to make.  I think I will try the chicken stock instead of water next time for more flavor and I even added a little over two tsp of chicken bouillon this time.  Also maybe less flour because i thought the sauce was a little too thick.  But all and all it was good! When you cook a lot you learn your tweaks after you make something for the first time.

Made this exactly as written. It was bland, as others have pointed out, but that is easily fixed by adding additional spices that suit your family's taste.  We had leftovers so I served it again.  The first night we had it over egg noodles.  The second night we had it over garlic mashed potatoes.  The mashed potato meal was the bigger hit.  The flavor was definitely enhanced by sitting in the fridge an extra day.  The texture and taste of the potatoes was preferred to the noodles.  I will definitely make this again using more spices.

I used about 1/2 c of chopped white mushrooms (not canned).  Only used 1/2 Green bell pepper (just because  not a big fan of green pepper.  Also added 3/4 c of chopped onion.  No bouillon in house so used 1 1/4 c of Chicken stock that heated up in micro  

We all loved it for dinner and have leftovers, too!!!!

Oh YUM!!  I made the recipe as written except that I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and cooking sherry in place of the reserved liquid from the canned mushrooms (which I didn't use).  It was WONDERFUL!  We'll be having this again soon - can't wait!  We served it over Basmati rice which was excellent.  Might try it over biscuits next time.

This is a comfort food for sure!  I serve mine over biscuits.  The pimento is a must add!  I also make it with fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  I found canned, organic mushrooms at a wholesale club.  They are as good as fresh and I use them now and save time.  People who have had them in some of my dishes...pizza...chicken marsala...and chicken a la king, are surprised when I say they are canned.

Made this tonight for dinner since my beau is home and loves chicken a la king. It was my first time making this dish so I was nervous but was pleasantly surprised how easy this was! I did make a couple changes as some other users suggested. I used frozen peas and carrots rather than green pepper and pimentos. I added half a cube more of chicken bouillon and added pepper to taste as I love freshly ground pepper. Also had to add a bit more milk to make it not so thick, but might try evaporated milk next time to save on calories and use fresh mushrooms rather than canned (i was making it late and wanted to save time).I served over jasmine rice and my bf LOVED it as did I. This will definitely be a staple on the menu.

My picky family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  For me, my mother made the best Chicken a la King.  I tried a different recipe years ago and was very disappointed.  And this is only the second time I am trying another recipe.   This recipe is almost exactly like I remember eating as a child, it took me down memory lane with many fond memories of sitting around the kitchen table with family enjoying delicious comfort food..  I did some minor tweaks just because of preference.  I added 2 -4.5 oz cans of mushrooms- 1 drained (liquid discarded) and one undrained and added in with 2 green peppers and 1/2 cup butter. Cooked over medium heat 7 mins.   I only used 3 large chicken breasts which I had boiled and then used that broth in place of the  1 1/4 cup of water.  I also added 1 chicken bouillion cube crushed.  I did follow rest of recipe as written.  This was an easy recipe to follow and I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks Colleen for  my trip down memory lane - it was scrumptious!!

I've been making this for my family for years and tweaked over time.  I use 3/4 cup frozen peas.  I poach 3 chicken breasts and add a spoonful of bullion powder and a bay leaf to the water.  Then I reserve 1 1/4 cup to reheat later or if it's closer to dinner I dip my measuring cup into the pot.  I use Pepperidge farm pastry shells.  This is a bit with

Thanks for the recipe!

I've made a little deviation from the steps. 

1. I've used chicken thighs
2. I breaded & fried the chicken rather than cooking alongside the sauce.
3. I ate it with rice :3

Still, the sauce was perrrfect!

Have made this several times now and have settled on some changes - 

1/2 the called for salt. 1/2 teaspoon. 
3 chicken Bouillion cubes seems to do it. 
No pimento (my wife doesn't like it)
Add 1/4 bag of frozen green peas same time as I add the chicken.

Really good comfort food!  Hubby was dubious but he ended up taking the leftovers to work. I did add peas because that's how my grandma made it. I also used fresh mushrooms because I think canned ones taste kike the can. Thanks

Replaced Bell Peppers with frozen peas and added matchstick carrots. Highly recommend adding some garlic powder to give it a bit more flavor. Easy and inexpensive dish to make!

I was very happy with the basic recipe.  It was easy to follow and turned out well.  I had to sub a couple of the veggies because I didn't have them on hand.  The creamy gravy was delicious.  I served it on biscuits and the family liked it.  It was good for a cold winter evening.

This turned out perfectly! The only changes  I made was I used real mushrooms and added chicken stock instead of the water and added the additional chicken bouillon flavouring  as well. It tasted wonderful, just like the chicken ala king I grew up with. Definitely I would make this again.

Very good dish. I have a Chicken a-la-King recipe very close to this one. I made it as written with one exception, made with
turkey. Thought that was chicken in the freezer.

Easy to make with good flavor all around, nice and thick, went great over rice. I never made with pimento. I think the pimento added a nice sweetness flavor to the dish.

This recipe is easily made, you can add or omit without ruining the whole dish. Served over wide noodles it just hits the spot! We + succotash, -- salt & lowered the bullion. Still a fabulous, easy make dish.

Bell peppers do not work at all in this recipe. Peas and carrots are traditional and work just fine. Also, why use water and bouillon? Chicken stock is the correct way. All in all, not a great recipe here

Used fresh mushrooms, and added red bell pepper, garlic, onion and celery. Started by making a roux with the butter and flour because I find that adding flour later in a recipe doesn't always work quite right. Didn't use any water, just thinned it with additional milk (maybe a cup?).

Served it over pasta. It was really good and we'll definitely have it again.

My mother has always loved Chicken A La King  but hadn't had it in decades!  I made her this recipe, and she LOVED it.  RAVED over it.  She said it's the best she ever had and asked me to tuck the recipe in a very safe place.  She loved it over toast.

Great recipe! Easy to substitute vegetables and adjust taste to your liking. I sautéed the chicken & veggies and then made the sauce separately since I have a few picky eaters. I also cut the butter and flour in half. The sauce was still very thick!

This is a very good recipe, easy and quick.  The thing I changed was replacing  the pimento with roasted slivered almonds, and using red pepper instead of green.  I like that it didn't use the cream of mushroom soup as there are a lot of additives in it, prefer to try and keep my cooking as pure as possible.

This is the first recipe review that I've ever written because this recipe truly is amazing. I probably veered off course during the course of cooking,  added too little flour and then maybe too much, added carrots and peas, rotisserie chicken, omitted pimientos, I doubled, then tripled the milk and stock but regardless, like a magical pot, we ended up with a delicious dinner. I'm making a second "batch" today for friends and family who are ill because  it seems like something that is hearty but will also freeze well. It was a hit with seniors, children and picky eaters.

My family and friends really liked this. I put over puff pastry shells. The picture shows peas, but peas are too overwhelmingly. If your palette enjoys simple home cooking, you'll enjoy this.

Great basic recipe...quick, easy, tasty. Added 1/4 cup sherry and 1/2 teaspoon paprika and omitted bell peppers. Served it over noodles. My husband's eyes rolled back in his head, it was so good. Thanks for sharing.

Would definitely make again!  I had leftover baked ham so I diced up my ham and added it.  I did have to add some additional spices such as parsley and garlic to add some flavor.  This is a nice basic recipe that you can change up with the spices and ingredients your family likes.

Since I didn't have pimentos, I used red bell pepper and sautéed along with 8-10 fresh mushrooms and some  sliced green onions.  I took the suggestions of others, used chicken broth instead of water and also added frozen peas. Served over mashed potatoes  along with a tossed green salad. Wonderful comfort food meal !

I think it probably tastes like it should, what I can remember from childhood.  It is very bland. The sauce is a good consistency and the recipe is easy. Needs some herbs to flavor it up a bit. Not the recipes fault, just my taste.

I use turkey, oh my it was delicious,  can't wait to make it again (served over toast)

I put this review into 2 sections for a better understanding. 

Section 1 - Preparation - 
The preparation of this meal was fantastic. Could have used a few adjustments to the list but for a basic Chicken Alá King it gets the job done. Overall cost was $15 CAD and it feeds 2 people. - 

Section 2 - Product outcome - 
The overall product is very bland with no hints of spices. I added a touch of garlic and some onion flakes to perk it up a bit without trying to destroy the original recipe that the person who posted this.  - 

Overall - 
It would have received a higher review from me since it was a fast cook except the overall taste of the final product was a "blah" without having to perk it up some.

I rated this only 3 as it is written.  I added lots of seasonings to it as without them, this recipe would have been very bland.  I did not use pimento as we aren't fans.  I replaced canned mushrooms with sliced fresh.  I replaced the water with lower sodium chicken broth.  I did not use the chicken bullion powder since I used the broth.  I dumped in some frozen peas and carrots.  I used both red and green bell pepper just becuase I had both.  I used 2 pods minced fresh garlic(next time I'll do 3 as I also added garlic salt).  I added some dried thyme and parsley and some cumin.  Probably a few shakes of each.  I added more black pepper,  and I added about 1 tsp. dried minced onion (next time I'll use chopped fresh onion).  I also added some celery salt (next time fresh chopped celery).  I used about 4 cups purchased, savory rotisserie chicken, pulled off bone in bite-size chunks.  Once I added the chicken, I turned the heat to low and just stirred occasionally until chicken was heated through, as I didn't want the chicken to turn to shredded chicken.  After all that it turned out quite nice.   I served it over biscuits (homemade) which was very good.  There are left-overs so next serving will be with noodles - maybe or I may go back to biscuits.  I made a salad to go with it and it made a nice meal.  My way I would give it a 4.5 or so.  It was much more flavorful than it started out.

I followed this exact recipe because it was my first time to cook Chicken A La King, upon my husband's request, and he liked it very much!  I felt so happy because online recipes can really be great!  Thank you :)

My family loved it.  I did make a few changes.  I love the flavors of tarragon and lemon juice, so I let the chicken breasts marinade in the frig for a couple of hours.  Also, I used fresh mushrooms and canned chicken stock instead of powdered. After cooking the chicken chunks, mushrooms, and bell peppers, I removed them from the skillet, deglazed the pan with a little white wine, and then followed the recipe.

I haven't tried this yet because frankly I forgot about it. Used to make it once a week when I was first married 36 years ago. It has all the ingredients I remember except I used to serve in a slightly sweet tart type shell. Need the pepper & pimento to get the true 1960's a la king flavor...just sayin':) Gonna try it again, hubby will love it (at least he used to!)Got my version from a cook book from 1942. Update: .Tried this version and it was as good as i remembered. Only change I made was to use leftover frozen turkey. Yummy. Thanks!

I was looking for a good basic recipe for this, but and this one suits with some additions. It definitely needed onions and garlic. Without those it would be quite bland. I sauteed the chopped onions with the mushrooms and peppers and added the garlic for the last minute. It came out extremely good and every drop was eaten.

This is a great recipe, although I do use whatever chicken I have on hand, even left over store bought rotisserie on occasion and substitute the water with chicken broth. Other than that I have to laugh at all the people who omit the green peppers and pimento.  Those are the two key ingredients that change this from what is basically a chicken stew or a chicken and (biscuits meal.  If you don't like the peppers and pimento, you don't like Chicken-A-La-King.

Made this tonight. Used chicken thighs instead of breast meat, added 2T of sherry, a bit of onion, and substituted chicken broth for water. It turned out very thick and gloppy for me, so I ended up using 2 cans of chicken broth to cure the problem. I added a pinch of chili powder to add flavor. Very yummy. I'll definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

My husband and I loved it!  As with a lot of people, I did make modifications.  I left out the green pepper and pimento and used celery instead.  At the end when I added the chicken, I also added a small can of peas and carrots.

I had never made Chicken a la King before .... this was an easy recipe and was very good. I took a hint from a another comment and left out the green pepper and added peas. Will definitely make it again. I served it over biscuits. 
(I also started with raw chicken breasts and simmered them the 1 1/4 cup water with some onion  and seasoning salt and then used that liquid in the recipe)

Good but I found the sauce was too thick and would only use 1/4 cup of flour next time. Also added a little cayenne which gave it a little needed kick.

I gave this a taste and as written I found it to be bland.
With the following additions, I was able to make it edible for all of us and we loved it.
I added another teaspoon of the bouillon powder, also added garlic powder, onion powder and poultry seasoning. That made a huge difference in taste then we loved it. I will use this recipe again with my additions and will also substitute frozen peas for the green pepper. We all prefer the frozen peas in dishes like this rather then green pepper.

Full of flavor! I was leery that this might be a little bland as is so I dressed it up a tad. Used the ingredient list, plus: Doubled the black pepper, added about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder during the saute and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper that went in with the salt and pepper. Recipe didn't say whether to drain the pimento brine or not. I just dumped the whole jar in. Glad I did.

I made this recipe AS IS and my wife and I both loved it. The only thing I felt it needed was more salt and pepper to bring out the flavor some more. The green peppers and pimientos go really well with this dish - just make sure you sautée the peppers until tender. 
On a side note, my wife commented on how this would make an excellent chicken pot pie filling if the peppers and pimientos were replaced by peas and carrots - and I agree!

Absolutely loved it!  My picky adult son devoured his and gave great compliments on it.  Everyone thought it was very good.  I substituted celery for the bell pepper, and we served this over puff pastry.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing a super recipe!

This is really bland.  I followed the recipe with one change, I added peas.  I made it because I thought the kids would like it, but even they didn't eat (ages 10 and 7) it.  As I ate, I kept thinking the dish would benefit from onions, leeks and garlic, but it's not worth making again to try.  Not a fan of chicken a la king.

DH and I happened to be watching an episode of Diners Drive-ins and Dives and Chicken a la King was being made.  We both chuckled about it being a "flashback" to our youth and how long it had been since we'd eaten it (over toast points) or even thought of Chicken a la King.  I made some that night using this recipe and we both LOVED it.  It's a simple dish to make with everyday ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe and the memory.  I've added it to my Recipe Box.

I grew up on Chicken A La King, but this has been the best version I've tried. Even prompted me to create an account so I could save the recipe. Made it verbatim using left over smoked turkey from thanksgiving. My kids are not fans of mushrooms but they all had seconds on this one. Will definitely make this again!

I made some substitutions. No pimento or green pepper. Used twice as many mushrooms, fresh if I have them. Frozen peas 12 oz bag. A can of low salt chicken broth. I did not add the salt but used herbs from my garden, a cup of fresh parsley and half cup of chives chopped and fresh thyme leaves to taste, all added with the chicken. Also added sherry 2 T.

My husband, myself, and 1 one of my kids thought this was bland.  My two picky eaters-who sometimes think pepperoni is too spicy-loved it.  Definitely depends on your own tastes.

This was very good and easy. Served over noodles. I did sub the water for chicken broth. This is a keeper. Made this for the second time, added onion, garlic and colored peppers. Doubled the sauce and put broccoli in. Served over rice.

We thought this recipe was a keeper for sure!  Very hearty comfort food!  I know some get very critical when one changes a recipe then rates it, but, after reading MANY reviews I made several small changes that worked for us.  The method is basically the same just changed and/or omitted some ingredients.  1)  cooked up some boneless skinless ckn thighs & breasts sprinkled with some season salt & garlic powder in oven @ 375 for about 25 min. 2) used 1 large tub fresh sliced mushrooms & sauteed them with 2 finely chopped shallots & 2 cloves garlic, pressed--omitted green pepper entirely per lots of reviews.  Plus it just didn't sound right!  3) only used about 1/4-1/3 c. flour  4)  used 1 c. half-n-half & 1/2 c. 1% milk & added 2 T. dry sherry  5) used 1 1/4-1 1/2 c. ckn broth--use 1 1/4 c. 1st then the rest to thin out sauce to desired consistency, if needed  6)  used about 1-1 1/2 c. frozen peas in lieu of green pepper, omitted pimento since almost every review I read said they omitted.  Added 1/2 jar coarsely chopped roasted red peppers instead--YUM!  Added the peas, chicken and peppers at the same time at the end.  Served over hot buttered egg noodles--Yep, it was good!  Will definitely make again

Good. I added onion and used canned milk. I did think that it needed a little something - a bit of garlic powder and dry mustard. Also left out the mushrooms (not a fan, but added frozen peas. Very easy and tasty.

Didn't read all the reviews; however, as one reviewer stated, it was bland.  The texture was just right, thick and creamy, but the flavor was lacking, as all eight of us agreed. I even used my own flavorful broth instead of water.  Maybe needs onion, garlic...and something else?  More herbs and seasonings...cream cheese?

This was very good. I really enjoyed the pepper flavor as the green pepper flavor really seeped in. The pimento was very good as well. This made a LOT of sauce, so putting it over rice or noodles or something (as the author stated) is really a must. But the sauce is so good you could probably even eat it like a soup lol. Thanks!

I made this recipe and it was fantastic.  I didn't have cooked chicken so I cut up about 2 pounds of chicken breast on the bias in strips and put that into a heavy pan after melting a half a stick of butter.  I covered it so it didn't brown and I guess it was more boiled than anything, but in the butter and its own juices.  Then I removed this, juices and all into a bowl.  Then in the same pan, uncleaned (but also without any brownings), I followed the recipe exactly adjusting for amounts to the amount of chicken.  I used canned whole button mushrooms.  When I added the chicken and pimento, I also included the butter and juices from cooking of the chicken.  Also I used 2% milk rather that whole milk.  The whole thing turned out creamy and delicious, but perhaps too buttery, but I didn't want to loose the chicken juices and the butter as let's face it this is culinary gold.  Likely in the future I will cut down the butter for the mushrooms and peppers I use for their saute, to offset the use of fresh
uncooked chicken.  I admit too that I did add frozen peas, because it just seemed appropriate.  The end result was delicious.  Chicken a la King has such a bad reputation somehow but this was fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great base recipe! Like the others, I also made a few adjustments. I added 1 TBSP of minced garlic, onion and some mixed veg; I also used a bullion cube instead of instant and omitted the green pepper and pimento. I ate it over Grand! Bicuits. Totally awesome!

Super easy to make, a little bland and this was my changes. I omitted the hot water and used the broth from the chicken I cooked. It was still a little bland. Next time I will add carrots and instead of pimentos, which were flavorless, add some red bell peppers. I served it over rice, which was good but will do biscuits next time. Thanks for sharing this with us.

I don't care for canned vegetables so used fresh, first sauteed those then onion, celery and green pepper.  Did a bullion cube w/ 2 cups of boiling water and then added 2 cups milk, I had to let it thicken for a while as I added a touch too much liquid (didn't have the recipe on me!).  I also added maybe 1/3 of a bag of frozen baby peas, as my Mom always made it with peas.  I served this with toast and a nice big salad, great comfornting fall meal!  Quick and yummy weeknight meal and perfect use for leftover chicken!

This recipe is fantastic! I did not use canned mushrooms, though. I bought some sliced and fresh mushrooms at the supermarket. I also used whole wheat flour but you never taste the difference. I added peas as most seem to have and did not add any bell pepper. I do agree that adding some extra chicken bouillon helps with taste. I love using black pepper so added more of that too. I also did not use any pimento. It still tasted extremely flavorful. In order to cook the chicken, I popped it in an oven-safe tray and set the oven to 500. It cooked pretty quickly and came out perfectly tender! Thank you for this recipe! I will be making this again soon! I had this over rigatoni. MMM! I'll be trying it with rice next time!

This recipe was SO good! I added an extra boullion cube because I thought it was a little bland. I definitely want to try this with peas next time. I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash and sauteed it and used the same pan for this recipe. I also only used half the amount of butter--no need for an entire stick!

Good base for the dish, but it was quite bland. We added onions, garlic, white pepper (makes big difference), bit of cayenne pepper and what really gave flavour was paprika.

So I did my own thing with this recipe, but it still has great "bones" for making Chicken a la King.  

I started off with chicken drumsticks (about 4 lbs) and seared them quickly in about 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil.  Took out the chicken when the skin was browned.  Sauteed up one medium onion in the remaining vegetable oil.  I also added 4 cloves of garlic.  I then added 4 cups of water to this and put the chicken back in the pot.  Boiled for about 10 minutes, then removed chicken again.

In another dish I made the rue using the butter, flour and milk called for in the recipe.  Added the rue to the chicken stock.  Then added 1 bag of mixed veggies (peas and carrots).  I probably tripled the chicken bouillon and also added 1/2 cup of sour cream to this.  

Finally, I took the skin off the chicken and hand shredded the chicken and added it back to the sauce.  Simmer until it boils and serve.

I did not use the pepper or chopped pimentos.  Was really great and my picky daughter loved it.  Lots of flavor and not bland.  Just remember to add way more bouillon than the recipe calls for.

I remember my mom making this when I was growing up! I changed it up with a bag of frozen mixed veggies instead of the mushrooms, green pepper and pimento, I also used the broth from boiling the chicken instead of plain water. My husband is pretty picky and he loved it. The kids love it too. I will be making this again!

I have been making this identical recipe since the early 80s.  It is so delicious.  I usually double it and freeze 2 separate 16 oz containers for future use.  I allow it too cool, then seal, and freeze.  On cooking day:
45 minutes before serving, remove container from freezer. Dip outside of container in hot water to loosen edges and remove from freezer container and place in large saucepan. Add 1/2 cup water, cover saucepan with lid, and heat on medium low stirring (or turning) every few minutes until hot.     I also use fresh mushrooms and add 1/2 cup of broth to make up for not having the reserved liquid from the canned mushrooms.  Also, I serve it over Pepperidge Farm Patty Shells, oh so so good.  I also use Fat Free half and half instead of milk.

Just made this for our dinner this evening and we both just loved it.  I did make a couple changes, no green bell pepper or mushrooms, as I didn't have any on hand.  Instead of hot water, used chicken broth that I had in freezer and didn't use any chicken bouillon.   Next time I make it will make sure I have mushrooms and green pepper on hand.  Served over Fluffy Whole Wheat biscuits by Ruth Ann Stelfox from this site.  
It's a great and versatile recipe and would give it a 10 if I could.

This is fantastic and very easy to make.  I made it this evening but I added some frozen peas.  Really as tasty as I remember having as a kid.  I am sorry I didn't find this recipe sooner.

This is a great recipe for Chicken a la King! I love my dish to be as flavoursome as possible so I shredded the meat of a shop-bought rotisserie chicken and followed the recipe. I added onions like another reviewer and eye-balled the amounts but this recipe is so easy to follow and personalise (lots of white pepper, more milk, less water) that I have to give it five stars! Thanks!

My family liked this even the pickiest eater in the house.  I didn't use peppers or pimentos but instead used frozen veggies.  I also added some poultry seasoning because there was not a lot of flavor like I'm used to.  I will also cut back on the chicken a bit.  Overall tasted good on a bed of brown rice.

Great! I did change it to how I remembered it as kid. I omitted the green pepper and pimentos (I didn't have them) and used frozen peas and chopped onions. I was going to put it over rice, but my family wanted to try it over biscuits instead. Loved the homemade sauce vs. using canned condensed soup.

This was awesome! Husband loved it, and so did my 9 year old. I left out mushrooms and pimentos. Cut my chicken in small chunks and cooked it with the pepper. Added garlic and onion powder. We will have this often.

Omit the green pepper (it's an odd flavor in a la king,) add a cup and a half of frozen mixed veggies instead. I substituted low sodium chicken broth for the water which gave it a much more pronounced chicken taste. I also substituted two packets of HerbOx Sodium Free Granulated Chicken Bouillion. The chicken flavor was much improved while drastically reducing the amount of sodium in the recipe. I also added a teaspoon of Texas Pete for a little spice.

This was great!  My husband wanted chicken a la king like he had when he was a kid and this hit the spot!  The only things I changed were: Halved the whole recipe (except the mushrooms) and added peas.  Served with a side of vegetables and biscuits

My family loved this and requested it again the following week. I did add one small finely chopped onion, 2 finely chopped celery stalks and sautteed those with the bell pepper. I added poultry seasoning and used only chicken broth, omitting the water and mushroom liquid. I doubled the mushrooms and served this with rice. This was very easy to make and I made it easier by buying a cooked rotissiere chicken!

I used 2 frozen chicken leg quarters.  Boiled those (for about 1/2 hr+) while I prepared the rest of the ingredients.  Used fresh mushrooms and did not miss having the liquid.  Cut back on gr. pepper and added leftover corn on the cob.  Served over mashed potatotes but will definitely use chow mein noodles next time.  Thanks for the tip Tennismom, that is how I remember this meal as a child. No pimento handy so I just sprinkled Paprika over each bowl. Both kids LOVED this, even the gr pepper hater!  Definite comfort food and makes you feel like a real cook even though it is easy to make.

Great recipe!  Instead of canned mushrooms, I used an 8 oz container of sliced baby bellas.  Omitted the green peppers and replaced that with a bag of frozen mixed veges (corn, peas, carrots and green beans).  Added a finely chopped medium onion and used two 4 oz jars of pimentos (with juice) finely chopped with food chopper.  I used chicken broth in place of water and boullion.  I had to add extra broth toward end because I let it cook a bit longer while waiting for rice to finish cooking.  Will definitely be adding this to my regular dinner rotation!!

I used the serving calculator and made this for 80. We served about 55 and had leftovers. I cut way down on the green pepper using three whole peppers. Did not add the pimentos. Served over biscuits with peas and carrots on the side along with a lettuce salad. It was a huge success.

This is a yummy recipe and was a hit at my house.  I added frozen peas to the recipe at the end of the preparation and should have added them with the onions as they were still crunchy.  Live and learn.  It was still good though.  :p

This is a great quick, simple and delicious meal.  We replaced the mushrooms with chopped onions b/c I don't like them and used peas and carrots in place of peppers and pimentos.  This is so fast and simple and can really be modified to fit any taste.  I described it like chicken pot pie without the pie shell.  We will be making this again, and trying with the peppers and pimentos.

Simple and Superb!!  Even when I am missing ingredients like, pimento, I can still pull this together, not to mention when I am in a super rush I just eyeball measurements and its always great! I don't like green peppers so I never use them and instead of pimento I often get roasted red peppers from the anitpasto section in the grocery store. I also always use fresh mushrooms!

Great recipe.  I did leave out the pimentos and substituted red bell pepper.  The green bell pepper tasted a little off in this recipe so I used only 1/2.  Served over rice.  Have made it for family and friends and has gone over well each time.

Omitted the mushrooms since roommates don't like them.  Used one cup frozen peas instead of bell pepper.  As one reviewer suggested, I put them in frozen while the gravy was boiling and I used canned milk, made it very rich!  Instead of water I used the broth from boiling the chicken breasts and added more as needed because the sauce was kind of thick.

Very good recipe!

I threw in about  1/2c. of chardonnay wine, some red pepper flakes, a little celery salt and poultry seasoning and some paprika.

You really can play around with this to make it super-duper Delicious!!!!

This was WAY too thick for us.  I added a ton of extra chicken broth and at the end I still found it too thick for my taste.  The taste was fine - nothing special, although we didn't add the mushrooms or bell pepper because that sounded weird... we subbed peas instead.  I don't know if I'll try making this again... I might just try my mom's recipe next time...

This is wonderful!  I do use chicken broth or stock in place of the water and bouillon granules.  I also add a splash of sherry. mmmmm....
I usually make extra as we love this for leftovers.


Update (many years later): STILL making this! My 24 year old daughter just requested this for her birthday dinner. It was the bomb! I made a smaller batch for myself gluten free by thickening it with Arrowroot powder at the end and leaving out the flour of course. :)

I loved this recipe! I used fresh mushrooms that were sauteed until tender in butter and garlic and instead of water I used the chicken broth from preparing the chicken.  My family does not like green peppers so I omitted them and I only used a dash of chicken bouillon to reduce the sodium. Once done I served the Chicken a la King over toast.  Excellent dinner for a cold winter evening.

Not bad.  I'm sure there's a better recipe out there.  Used peas.  Over egg noodles.  Cooked the chicken while the sauce was bubbling only, so the chicken was nice and tender.  NOT overcooked!

This is an excellent chicken a la king recipe. Instead of using the 4 oz. of chopped pimento (forgot to buy them), I used a whole chopped red pepper and it came out so good, I'll probably continue to just use that. Will definatly be making again come wintertime, this is a perfect dish for a snowy night. I think next time I may double the recipe and freeze half into small containers for an easy dinner later on.

Ok so I made this for my family and they loved it. I did change a few things. I didn't add any peppers. I added half an onion, 2 heaping spoonfuls of chopped garlic a bag of mixed veggies and I doubled the mushrooms. It was great.

This was great. I've only had this dish as a TV dinner and always wanted to try one at home.  I had a bunch of chicken breasts that I had already cooked (in the oven seasoned with Italian dressing) that I used.  This recipe was a little bland but I just added a little of whatever from my seasonings cabinet and the flavored chicken helped, too.  Overall, very easy and very tasty...my family loved it. Definitely added to my normal rotation.

This is a really good recipe. I change the veggies(to what husband likes) but followed the recipe for the sauce as is, it was really good, will make again.

Awesome...I actually used leftover turkey that needed to be eaten...I also added onion and garlic.  I served it over rice and my picky 2 yr old had seconds! It was delicious. Thank you.

I stayed pretty close to this recipe with a few changes: used fresh brown mushrooms instead of canned, used 1 1/2 cups of homemade chicken stock instead of the water and chicken boullion, increased the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon, added 1/2 cup of diced celery sauteed with the mushrooms and green pepper. I also left the finished dish to simmer very slowly for an hour to develope the flavours. It was yummy, my wife loved it and I will definitely make it again.

This was fabulous. I did have to wait quite a while before it thickened. I wasn't prepared for that. I made Alton Brown biscuits to go along with it. We had this combination from our Catholic grade school lunch kitchen. Those lunch ladies made these remarkable homemade meals.  Chicken on biscuits was one of them. This was a more adult version, but this adult palate loved it. All my siblings stopped over throughout the evening after I told them what I was making. We all remember this dish fondly. Thanks for sharing it.

I was really dissappointed with this recipe.  It was pretty bland and "starchy" tasting.  I didn't add the mushrooms with the juice so maybe that made the difference.  If I make this meal again I think that I will add less flour (it was very thick) and perhaps substitute some chicken broth in for some of the water.

Not the best Chicken a la King I've ever had and probably won't make again... definitely something missing but I couldn't figure it out.
