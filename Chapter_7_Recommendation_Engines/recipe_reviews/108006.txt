Awesome salad!  To me, tomatoes and fresh basil are a classic combination that go together like peanut butter and jelly!  My bread was already stale, so it didn't take long to dry out.  I love the addition of capers in this. I didn't change a thing except to add an extra splash of red wine vinegar.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use onions (can't stand raw onions), and couldn't find French or Italian bread, so I substituted regular bread.  Like several other reviewers, I added 2  small, nearly seedless chopped cucumbers and some chopped mozzarella.
This got a major "Wow" from my family!  We will definitely be making it more often, and I am hoping to take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow if my husband doesn't sneak downstairs and eat them all tonight!!

If you like bruschetta, you'll love this salad!  Great as written or with the addition of a chopped cucumber or a can of white beans.

Excellent recipe.  I made one small change...I added chunks of fresh mozarella just before serving.  What a hit!  I would recommend doubling this recipe...for four people I didn't have enough.  So simple and soooo good!

I wasn't a big fan of the bread cubes (I left them out of most of the salad, except tried it with one serving, letting it sit for 10 min. like recipe said) I LOVE the tomato salad, and will keep making this without the bread. Awesome way to use up garden tomatoes before they go bad!

This is defintely a five star recipe.  I made as written except at the end added a little balsamic vinegar.  This made it even yummier but it wasn't necessary.  Obviously, there is quite a bit of chopping but I thought this was super easy to put together....

We've tried (and liked) other bread salad recipes from ar, but this was the first one with toasted bread and capers.  Nice change.  Yummy fresh.  Added chopped seedless cucumber.

this salad was awesome.  I think it would have been good with chunks of chicken in it too.

Excellent summer salad!  I drizzled the bread with evoo and sprinkled with basil and thyme before baking.  I added cucumbers and mozzarella to make it a little more substantial.  And I drizzled the dressing on before topping with the bread so it didn't soak it all up.  Extremely satisfying!

I made some changes but that is the beauty of this recipe, you can make it your own.  Tossed the bread cubes with olive oil, salt, pepper and minced garlic before baking.  The fresh tomatos and basil make this dish.  Thanks!

This was very good - unfortunately I found my bread was not only stale, but also moldy! So I added about 3 cups of baby spinach and made a breadless salad instead.  Capers added a nice touch without being overpowering, and I liked the change from my usual balsamic to red wine vinegar.  The only thing I did not do was salt the tomatoes as the instructions stated - they were juicy enough and I was concerned that the capers would lend too much saltiness to the salad.  I ended up salting to taste near the end, adding a pinch of salt.  Will definitely make again! (Next time WITH bread!)

Absolutely amazingly delicious.  Was even good as leftovers two and three days later.  Tasted great and felt ever so healthy.

There is no need to add salt to the salad because the capers add plenty on their own.

Just wonderful, so fresh-tasting. My 3 yr. old, 5 yr old, and 1 yr old sat out in the sun room and ate until we could pop. The kids loved it!
