This is delicious and unique!  I love the combination of zuchinni, beans, and corn.  I omitted the poblano and added about 1 tsp. of ground cumin and 1 tsp. of chili powder to perk up the flavors.  I served with low-fat cheddar cheese and taco sauce.  I can't wait to have this again!!

Somewhat bland. My grandmother's recipe always used jalapeno, diced red pepper, fresh cut corn off the cob, diced zucchini & yellow squash and perhaps a bit of cilantro and no beans. We use this as a filling for a warm tortilla. It's a nice meatless meal.

Easy!  I prepared this the night before and carried it to a pitch-in.  It was a great side with the fajitas that were served.  I did add a can of tomatoes and chilis.  I am glad I did.  I think it would have been a bit bland.  It was also great warmed up and covered with a bit of cheese. I'll make it again.

I tend to take the best of all recommended changes to recipes and make my own personal masterpiece.  And I did with this dish, which came out delicious.  I made 12 servings for a friend's Cinco De Mayo party, which was more than I expected, yet most of it was eaten up, mostly as a side dish, but also as a main course for the two vegetarians at the party.  Here's the changes I made to the four (4 ) serving recipe originally shown on allrecipes.com:  Instead of 4 zucchini, I used 2 zucchini and 2 butternut squash (for color).  I used 1 can of Ro*Tel tomatoes because they're lightly spicy, and 1 tablespoon of cilantro.  I then covered and sauteed until soft, over medium heat, stirring about once a minute.  Then, I stirred in the recommended amount of corn, but reduced the beans by 1/3, about 10 ounces.  While that mixture was heating, I added the recommended amount of salt, plus 1 fresh lime, 1 teaspoon of chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.  Continue to cook uncovered, stirring about once a minute.  I also found out it's just as delicious cold as warm.  If you can let it sit for a few hours in the refrigerator, and then thoroughly stir it, and microwave it (or serve it cold), it tastes even better.

I really like this recipe! Easy, lots of veg. Needed a little more seasoning, since I don't like spicy food and omitted the poblano. I also tried it as is and then with a can of diced tomatoes. The tomatoes definitely added a lot to the flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I love green chilis so I add them.  I omit the beans.  I dice everything but the garlic. That I mince. And where are the tomatoes?  I didn't have any fresh so I put in a can of Ro*Tel.  Tomatoes really add something for me and so does the pepper jack cheese I had on hand.  I also added Texas Gunpowder which is dried ground jalapeno in a shaker.  I needed more salt too.

My husband eats this with sour cream on a tortilla and loves it (so do I). We aren't vegans so if I have it, I'll even add some leftover pork or chicken.  You really can't mess this up.  You gotta love that!

For all that color and contrast it was like a trick on your tastebuds once it hit your mouth - where did the flavor go?

Very good side dish recipe.  I substituted canned green chilies for the poblano and added some chili powder.  A new favorite!

Omit the black beans, use hot Hatch green chile (anaheims) instead of the poblano.  Best if the chiles are roasted and peeled.  A New Mexico classic on a tortilla topped with red chile.

This is a great veggie meal. I used jalapeno rather than poblano pepper and added about 1 tsp of cumin.  I served this with flour tortillas and shredded pepper jack cheese, but it tastes great on its own as well.  Thanks!

I really only threw this together to use up a can of black beans that's been sitting in the cupboard gathering dust  for months. So, I was absolutely amazed when Husband went crazy over it, wolfing down all four servings in one sitting! I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks so much!

Seasoning is not balanced at all. Definitely needs some acidity. Lime or lemon juice would be good, but I used rice vinegar because that's what I had on hand. Really perked up the earthiness of the beans. I used "regular" corn, which isn't very sweet, so I added a shredded carrot. Next time, I'll make sure to buy organic frozen white corn. Added a few grinds of black pepper, but if I make this for spice-minded folks in the future, will add a minced habanero or sprinkle of chipotle powder. As others have said, a good start. Thanks for posting.

This is my favorite side dishe with all mexican entrees. It has it all, veggies, grains and beans. The only thing I change about it is adding some cumin, about a teaspoon and some chopped cilantro at the end for mor flavor.

We don't mix the beans with the zuccini in Mexico. The original recipe only uses corn, green chile roasted slices and cream. The chile pepper is not supposed to be red.

Normally I do not enjoy zucchini very much but loved it in this recipe! It was so yummy! This recipe was also very easy to make and put together. I followed the directions except used canned corn instead of frozen. We put it in corn tortillas and topped with cheese. We will make this again!

Good starter recipe.  Needs more flavor!!!! I added some garlic and pepper, and still felt it needed a little extra something.  Really good recipe to play around with and make it your own.  Thanks.

Mmmmm, delicious! I added a dash of chili powder and cumin, omitted the salt, added a bit of dried cilantro, used a cubanelle and an ancient red pepper, and used less corn and beans (not a fan). I've had this recipe in my box for almost five years now, and I'm sorry that I haven't been able to try this sooner. I'll definitely make this again.

I really liked this.  I used the actual Calabacita squash/zucchini.  It tastes so much better than the regular.  I also used a jalapeno olive oil instead of the peppers.  i didn't put in the beans ( I didn't have any)  I added 1/2 a red bell pepper instead!  Supper yummy!

This was SO yummy! The only thing that I changed was that I didn't use black beans...I thought that I had a can, but I didn't. Next time, I will make sure I do. I kept thinking of all of the great ways you could serve this...as a side dish (which is what I did), or over rice, as taco finning or even veggie enchiladas...I am definately going to experiment with this one!

Great recipe for calabacitas.  I omitted the black beans since I was using it as a side dish and added just a dash of cumin.  I will try it again soon with the beans and just a little cheese in a tortilla wrap.  This is much better than the recipe that I have used for years.  Thanks.

So I changed this a bit.  My husband has to have meat, so I cooked bacon, and instead of the olive oil I cooked it  in some of the bacon grease leaving the bacon in the pan.  I also added a jalapeno, green pepper and red pepper.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe that I have fixed for years, but I added a can of stewed tomatoes and some oregano and basil which really adds to the flavor.  I also only use about 1/2 an onion.  My family loves it.

This was good but too much onion for my husbands taste. Feel like it could use a little seasoning too - perhaps next time I will try the chili powder suggestion. I too used canned diced chilis which gave it some kick (that is what I had on hand). Very fast and easy. Good basic recipe that I will make again with some modifications.

This is a fantastic dish that can be used either as a side dish or as an entree.  I made it up in about 15 minutes, which is important for a person with minimal cooking/prep time like myself.  Very tasty.

Excellent... Thank you for a "new" veggie dish for our house (I used leftovers the next morning for omeletes)

I thought this was just so-so.  Thought that if I put shredded cheese in, perhaps a colby-jack, it would taste a lot better.  Don't know how authentic this dish is, so perhaps the cheese would go counter to authenticity.  Regardless, I felt the dish was lacking something.  Side note:  Be careful when cutting up the poblano.  I figured that with a milder pepper, I could be a little freer exposing my skin to it.  My hands burned for about 2 hours.  Yikes!

Turned this recipe into a soup, and it was delicious!  Sautéed red, yellow, and green peppers instead of the poblano, and I added chicken boullion, fresh ground cumin and fresh cilantro leaves.  Excellent way to jazz up squash.

Very good. I used a combination of zucchini and yellow squash and replaced the poblano pepper with a jalapeno. Very tasty and refreshing, thank you :)

Really good!  Tasty, easy, quick and cheap-a real winner!  I added a can of Rotel and some Mexican seasoning blend as the recipe was a touch bland as written (which is the only reason for the 4 star rating).  With the additions, it was awesome!  Served it in tortillas with cheese-yummy and healthy too!  We'll be making this regularly.  Thank you!

This was pretty good.  I added a can of diced tomatoes and a pinch of ground cumin seed.  Will make again - inexpensive and packed full of nutrients.

This was exactly what i was looking for. I thought it was very good and light side dish. Or you could put on a burrito, taco or any type of wrap. My friends didn't really care for it though (they are kinda picky eaters anyway).

I made it as a side dish for 12 people.  I used the "change servings" button and ended up needing 12 zucchini!  I only used 6.  I added a can of tomatoes and took out one can of corn.  It smelled so good but didn't have much flavor.  It made too much and it had way too much zucchini in it.  I will make it again but I will be adjusting the recipe.

Very tasty.  My 2 year old gobbled it up.  I used an Anaheim Chile instead because it's what I had on hand.  If I wasn't feeding it to my kiddos, I'd enjoy a little kick.

It's a nice dish. I didn't rinse the beans. When I added the corn and beans I also added a pinch of kosher salt and about 1/2 tsp cumim. I topped a serving with swiss cheese. It would be great with shrimp, chicken, turkey or a mild meat. It's great for vegan and vegetarians looking for a change up.

a couple things first...i did not use corn, not always a fan of the sweetness, so left it out. Had frozen roasted green chilis in the freezer, so threw one of those in the pan to defrost when I added the zucchini...then realized I should have removed the seend, these were quite potent.  Did my best to removed of the seeds from the pan...still added quite  bit of heat to the dish. At the end I added a fresh tomato and an avocado.  Served as a side dish with grilled fish tacos.  I liked it.  Kept well for a few days in the fridge so I could bring it to work for lunch...was yummy reheated too.

My family enjoyed, but I added about twice as much Poblano as the recipe called for.  I would like to try some of the other ideas such as adding cheese and an avocado next time!

I made this for my family as a side dish with chicken enchiladas and it was huge success. I added sweet cherry tomatoes on top just before serving. My husband told me he had never liked black beans before, but he loved the dish.We like spicy food so  I sprinkled a little Fiesta seasoning on top & tossed, I think you could sprinkle a little bit of Taco seasoning instead and it would be just as good.

Another "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" recipe.  Very simple and basic, but very good.  Only thing different I did was to not add beans, as I was also serving black beans for dinner.  A good counterpoint to a spicy or complex main or other side.

This recipe has potential, but as written it is bland, bland, bland. Also, the picture doesn't match the recipe. There are red bell peppers in the picture, but they are not called for in the recipe. I think this recipe would be helped with a liberal dose of Mexican spices.

Added two 15oz cans of diced tomatoes (use fresh when in season), and left it uncooked in the fridge.  Cooked it in small batches (sauteed or roasted) with the juice of one lime added to most batches.  Used as a side with tacos, burritos etc.  Using the last of it in a brunch casserole.

I have made this dish 2 or 3 times now.   I've enjoyed the dish each time but made with green pepper previously.  The last time was the first when I used a poblano pepper.  Either way, this is a tasty dish of high nutrition. Please be forewarned, however,  that the poblano is very spicy and can cause considerable discomfort to sensitive areas.  Consequently, plastic gloves are highly recommended when handling cut peppers.

Great basic recipe; one poblano and three garlic cloves weren't enough for us. Will make again with seasonings adjusted for our preference.

Pretty tasty! I sautéed the onions quite a while to bring out the sweetness, then just lightly cooked the rest to heat through and soften the squash (but not let it get mushy!). For leftovers, I added some spinach and reheated in the skillet. Just as good, maybe better that way.

Simple and easy to prepare. Delicous over rice or noodles, with added Soy sauce and Mozarrela cheese sprinkled over ingredients over rice or noodles.
