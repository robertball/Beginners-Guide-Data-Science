As hubs put it, bread is generally neutral in flavor and that's good and the way it should be.  And when bread IS flavored with something, it's often overpowering.  When he eats bread, he says, he wants bread, not a mouthful of herbs, for instance.  With this bread, however, the combination of flavors is subtle and pleasant.  It's hard to describe what it tastes like because all of the seasonings are so well blended.  I do detect the chili powder and a hint of the beer, and even though I did not use the chile oil and only half the amount of cayenne pepper called for, we still could detect the "bite." I know neither of us would have cared for this had I used both and in the amounts called for because we wouldn't like "hot and spicy" bread!  Just to make things simple I used the 3:1 ratio of flour and liquid, so I used a cup of beer and three cups of flour, then upped the rest of the ingredients just slightly to compensate.  I will be serving this with "White Chili with Chicken," also from this site.  (Hubs generally resists any kind of flavored bread and he really liked this one!)

This is the first recipe I have ever reviewed and I am an avid baker.  I do not own a bread baker and make all my bread from scratch.  I made the following changes and was able to make it without a bread baker.  I used 2.5 tsp of dry active yeast which I proofed in 2 oz of warm water - 110 degrees (I just run my faucet at the hottest for a minute to get the right temperature)for about 6 minutes until the yeast blooms.  I then weigh my flour (9.55 oz).  I add all the spices although I reduced the onion to 1/2 T, 5 oz of beer and 2 T of regular olive oil.  I knead it in my mixer using the dough hook for 6 min.  I let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, I then roll it out to 8.5 by 5 inch rectangle and roll it up from the long side, put in 8.5 by 4 inh loaf pan, let it rise another hour and then bake at 400 for 30 minutes

Super delish! Made my own chili oil mixing a little olive oil with red pepper flakes. Put the beer, spices & wet ingred. in the bread maker & let sit until room temp. Put the flour & yeast on top and it turned out so, so tasty!

I made this with a bread machine with no changes to the recipe and its was great.  The next time I made it I added half a cup of cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup diced jalapenos and it was incredible!

I really loved the spices - I increased them and toasted cumin seeds - but the actual bread crumb was not up to par. I will probably transfer the spices over to another bread recipe.

This bread has become a favorite in our house. I've been making it now on a regular basis for a few months now. The Hubby just loves it. If you are looking for a treat to take to a pot luck dinner.... this will win you friends!

This smells so good when it is mixing in the machine and then again whe it is baking.  It takes some time to get all the ingredients together but the flavor is worth it.  Especially when you nuke it a little before you butter it!!

So good!  I purposely left out the chili oil bc 1.  don't have it and 2.  we don't like spicy spicy.  I also only put a sprinkle of cayenne bc, well, see 2 above and I was sure it would be too spicy for us. This way was perfect--good chili flavor, a touch spicy but not overwhelming--and a really good bread with cheese.  It'll be good bread for sandwiches, too, I'm sure.  So easy, and easily adjusted to make by hand or in a mixer if you don't have a breadmaker.  I just used my dough setting, let it rise in a bread pan for about 20 mins, then baked at 375 for 40 mins.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

A must have with chili! This bread is SO good that we (just the 2 of us) eat almost the whole loaf in one sitting. I really wish I had a two loaf machine for this recipe ;)

This is a great dipping bread.  My husband loves it, I make it twice a week now but as he is a huge Chili fan I did increase the chili powder.  I was not sure what kind of beer to use, so used a strong lager - thanks for a great recipe.

I was underwhelmed by this bread. There is some flavor present in it that tastes a little odd. (I think it is the bullion.) If I ever make this again, I will reduce the bullion (or eliminate it) and reduce the onion powder.
