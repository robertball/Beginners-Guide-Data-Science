very good.  The first review reflected incorrect recipe.  The milk had been ommitted.

Quite nice but the water needed is too much. I put a lesser water and the recipe is almost perfect

Very smooth, very sweet, and very rich - delicious!  My son requested this for his class "winter party" and they all loved it.  We served it in an air pot and it stayed fairly well mixed.  At home, we make the base and keep in the fridge.  Just stir, pour a little in a mug, and add water for a serving.  Heats quickly and froths up in the microwave - about 35 secs per coffee mugful.  16 oz is a LARGE single serving.  Try scaling to 6 servings - makes enough for about 15 mugs.

This is really rich.  I make this for my 13 year old son who is very tall and skinny.  He likes it with chocolate condensed milk best.  I also add a dash of half & half for thickness and heavy whipping cream ( whipped with sugar) to top it off.  Very heavy calories.  Of course if this is still not enough, marshmallow cream or marshmallows may be added!

I would give this 100 stars if I could! I was looking for something quick and easy and this is amazing. My favorite hot chocolate in the universe! So rich, it is actually creamy... MMMMM.... I first made it with sweetened condensed milk, then, ran out, so I just used 2 tablespoons of sugar instead. Tastes exactly the same. No need for whipped cream or marshmallows. Made some & took it to my husband at work. He said it was too rich! No way! It is magical. I usually only like to try recipies with lots of ratings, but, this is a keeper. I keep going to the store for evaporated milk!

I made this for my boys this morning, only using a saucepan to heat it up. They loved it but I thought it was WAY too sweet. I'm surprized my kids weren't bouncing off the walls. If I were to make this again, I'd cut out the sugar and cut the evaporated milk in half and use whole milk.

This is beyond gross.  Never trust a recipe that contains ingredients like "powdered chocolate drink mix".
