This marinade was quite nice.  I added a little more honey than the recipe stated, and some chili oil.  I set it in the fridge in the morning, and by afternoon the chicken was soaked with the flavorful liquid! A little more brown sugar at the end, and in the broiler it went!  Out came a delicious chicken dish! With the left over marinade I made a quick glaze, which was a nice topping for the chicken! Thanks!

This was DELICIOUS. I made it for my mother on Mother's Day, not entirely sure how it would turn out.
It did take longer than 8 minutes under the broiler though, but that didn't really bother me.
It turned out great, especially if you leave it under just a little longer to get a tiny bit of a burned edge. 
I found the sauce thickened once left standing, it made a great sauce to dip the chicken in for more flavor. Thanks!

I give the recipe 4*s and my version of it 5*s of course because it's tweeked to my personal taste buds...  When I first read the ingreds it sounded like they may not go together well but surprisingly it merged to make a nice taste as a whole.  I personally found the amount of oils too much and so dimmed them down some.. I also put mandarin juice instead of orange juice but a little less than instructed(which REALLY improved the taste in my opinion) and then cut back a tiny bit on the italian spices.  
Definitely something different yet good enough to not be "weird" tasting.  Will be making it again... So thanks for sharing your creation with us!

This was a good, quick meal.  The only complaint that the soy was too dominant of a flavor (had to double the recipe).  I think we will reduce that just a bit next time...want to taste more of that vanilla.  I added some green onions and sesame seeds at the end.  Nice idea, thanks for the post.

This was quite excellent, despite my misgivings about the vanilla.  I will make it again!

This was delicious! I didn't have orange juice or honey, so I put orange marmalade in instead. I omitted the hot sauce. Easy to put together, and cooks in 10-12 minutes under the broiler. This recipe is a keeper.

I omitted the italian seasonig from this one.  Just couldn't do it. We liked it. The flavor was good.  Would double the sauce to serve over rice.

We enjoyed this dish, but thought there were maybe too many ingredients for the return on flavour.  Will probably make this again to give it another try.

Tasty!! I did change the recipe just a bit though. I omitted the sesame oil and broiled it long enough to get both sides brown and then turned the oven onto 400 degrees for about 10 mins. I added a little extra brown sugar and vanilla. Next time I think I won't add as much soy sauce. It was a bit over powering. Overall though a very tasty recipe. Will make again.

I added green onions and fried it in a wok instead of broiling. It turned out great. The chicken needs to be cooked before adding the glaze if fried though, or it will burn. Great flavor.

This chicken came out so tender and tasty.  I served it with sesame teriyaki noodles, and it was the perfect complement.  Instead of honey, I used a sweet and sour sauce, and I didn't have any sesame oil, so I went without.  But it was still so delicious.

I was somewhat skeptical  when I read this recipe but I decided to try it anyway.  Well I'm so glad I did. It was super easy to prepare. The chicken came out very moist and tasty.  The only thing I might suggest next time is a little less soy sauce because the strong taste overwhelms everything else.  I might also try this marinade on other things like salmon.  Thanks!!

I made this with the intentions of finally getting my wife to say she didn't like something I cooked, but this actually ended up being a surprisingly good dish. I didn't use the italian seasoning, as I didn't want anything competing with the sweet and salty flavors. I knew that vanilla can be used with seafood and poultry with positive results, I just couldn't imagine the taste. It was subtle and fragrant, and went surprisingly well, although next time I might cut down on it just a tad, because I can see this dish intimidating people who don't enjoy trying incorporating common flavors into uncommon dishes.

This was pretty good, I wish there was a stronger honey flavor and less of an Italian flavor, though.  I don't know if we would make this again.  I served this with whole grain rice.

I really enjoyed this.  And my husband (who never comments) said that he enjoyed it.  We both have a bit of a sweet though :).  It was a nice combination.  I didn't have *orange juice* but I did have some frozen concentrate, so I used some of that instead of making it into orange juice.

Good recipe! I used a 6x6 pan instead, and made some extra sauce to let the chicken continue marinating while it cooked. The chicken was super tender, and really flavorful. Next time I make it, I might tweak the amount of sweetness- it was a little much.

This quickly became a fav among my family.  I make it a few times a month.  The only thing I have changed when I make it is that I leave out the Italian seasoning. Amazing dish!!!

Very tasty and moist, even though we had to be creative with some proportions (the fridge was a bit bare)  I'll definitely try again after I've had a chance to restock my seasonings & soy sauce.
