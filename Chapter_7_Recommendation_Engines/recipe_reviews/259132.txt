I've made this twice so far. I dropped the ginger to 1/8 tsp since it's not my favorite thing. I also didn't bother to take the eggs out of the fridge, and I used regular butter rather than clarified, and as another reviewer mentioned, I added a teaspoon of sugar. Definitely our favorite Dutch baby recipe so far -- I make a brown-butter icing (brown butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and milk) to go on top and it's so yummy!

This version of a Baby Dutch turned out really nice.  I added a teaspoon of sugar to mine because I like it a little more sweet.  I am also at a higher altitude and have a convection oven so I cooked it for 18 mins and it was cooked perfect.  I love the hint of fall spices.
