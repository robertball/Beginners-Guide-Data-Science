This is so similar to baked beans that my mother-in-law used to make.  I think the ingredients are the same but the way she made them was different.  She cooked the bacon first and added that crumbled up to the beans instead of on top.  Then she'd cook the onions in the bacon fat until they were clear.  Then add the cooked onions and everything else to the beans and cook for a much shorter time in the oven.  An hour or maybe less.  That's how I've been making them and they're fantastic!  Excellent, easy, fast recipe for baked beans: the way they were meant to be.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is a very nice recipe. I followed the ingredients to the letter; however I sped up the process. I browned the bacon and sauted the onions on the stove top - added the rest and heated through. Once heated through I transferred to a crockpot to finish cooking on low 2-3 hours.

This recipe was VERY sweet. Too sweet for my taste. I used canned baked beans. Was the recipe supposed to read canned pork and beans? The sugar from the canned beans plus the molasses and brown sugar added was a bit much.

I made these beans scaled to serve 100 for a wedding recption.  I received more comments on them than I can count.  They were quick & easy.  The longest preparation item is cooking the bacon.  The only downfall is, they really do need to bake 3 hours or they are a bit runny.  Then again, that is a just a matter of preference.

Great recipe, I made these in my slow cooker and they turned out great. Everyone loved them, in fact there weren't any leftovers. I followed the recipe exact, except I added a bit of liquid smoke. Yum Yum.

Given the amount of molasses and brown sugar in this recipe, I can only rate this a weak two stars. I used half the amount of each and hubs said if I had used what was called for it would have tasted only of molasses and sugar. I sauteed the bacon and onion and added it to the beans with the remaining ingredients, then just threw it in the slow cooker. While these beans were acceptable (three stars with half the sugar and molasses), they are not extraordinary in any way. Frankly, I think a can of Bush's Homestyle Baked Beans would have been just as good without the additional effort of doctoring up a can of pork and beans.

Quick and easy! This is a classic picnic side dish that's always a hit at BBQ's. Other than cutting back on the molasses and brown sugar then adding a bit of liquid smoke I wouldn't change a thing. This definitely is a great way to take a regular 'ol can of baked beans and turn them into something special without a lot of effort!

I needed a quick Baked Bean recipe for a lunch gathering at work.  These are the best baked beans I have ever tasted ... not dry, easy to make and not alot of looking around for non-existing or expensive ingredients. Great in the slow cooker too.  I'm keeping this one for sure!!  Thanks Brandi, for a GREAT recipe, I will make this one often.

I LOVED THESE BEANS, and after reading some of the reviews there were some hints that I really liked.  I wanted to serve about 10- 15 ppl.  I used two large cans of the Bush's original and one of the bold and spicy.  I cooked about 4- 5 pieces of bacon that I cut into small pieces before cooking.  I then saut√©'d the onions in the bacon grease until translucent to lightly browned.  Mix together the beans, mustard, Ketchup, molasses, SKIP the brown sugar unless you like the beans even more on the sweet sweet side.  MIX IN the bacon and onions.  I used at least a half of large onion, 2tbs mustard and 1/4 cup ketchup.  I then placed in oven cover and bake for three hours.  LOVELY smell in the house, and the taste... MMMMM fabulous!!!  Tastes like you cooked them completely from scratch!!

nice to have a recipe you don't need to change or add to and have it come out tasting great.  I have made this without molasses and it still taste good, I do think the molasses makes a difference and would encourage using it if you can.

These beans rock! People who don't even like baked beans thought these were fantastic.  Cook's Illustrated said "Bush's Best Original Baked Beans" have the best texture & rated them second best for taste so I started with them (NOT "Pork & Beans").  The ONLY way the recipe was altered was to par-cook the bacon in microwave (not a fan of limp bacon). These were quick, easy, and tasted great! What more could you ask for?

We LOVE this recipe.  I now make it for most of our family gatherings and it is a favorite.  Yes, it is a bit sweet, but then, that is how baked beans are supposed to taste.  We don't make any changes at all to the recipe.

I made these for a Christmas dinner at work.  I bought a 72 oz can of beans.  I didn't have any molasses so I used honey.  I used about half the amount of bacon and onion.  I can't count how many compliments I got.  Everyone LOVED them!  I am always looking for a good baked bean recipe.  I will look no further!

I recently made this baked bean recipe for a 50th birthday party and changed the amount ingredients to serve 150 people. I received so many compliments from folks saying this was the best baked beans they ever had. I had never made this recipe before, but I will use this recipe from now on. Thank you very much.

I've been making my baked beans like this for years.  The only thing that I do differently, is that I layer onions and 3/4 lb of bacon on the top of the beans.  The bacon flavors the beans and it gets really crispy on the top.  I get rave reviews for my beans wherever I take them!

This is an easy, basic, and adaptable recipe! I doubled it to make 20 servings for a 50th birthday bash, and got two great compliments, one from the birthday boy and one from the best cook in the family.  I did it in the crock pot, and found that very convenient. However I would make a couple changes: I used 4 cans of pork and beans, in the future I will drain two of them. Some of the bean liquid is needed but there was too much. Also, it is a little on the sweet side so I might decrease the amount of sugar. A few too many onions for our liking as well.   The recipe was unclear about whether the bacon should be cooked first, although I assumed it should be and in the end we agreed that was a good idea.   Finally, the molasses I had used was apple cider molasses. I'm not sure how much of a difference that made but it would be interesting to try it with "regular" molasses.

I received great compliments on this recipe. I cooked it according to the directions. I used a little less than 1/4 cup on the onions. I also used Bush's Original Baked Beans. This is a keeper for summer picnics or family gatherings. Thanks!

The family LOVED it!  I made it for the holidays and they tore it up.  Per my taste, I added some diced bell pepper,  a little garlic and a little cayenne to set it off.  Will remember this one during grilling season.

Any time I barbeque, I make these beans.  My family loves them and they always come out fabulous.  I use Bush's Thick and Rich Country Style Baked beans and typically scale the recipe to 15.  Always Perfect!

The most delicious baked beans I had ever had! The bacon really makes this dish- don't skip it. I tried making this recipe last minute for dinner last night, and the 3 hour cooking time really makes a difference, but it's still delicious with just an hour of cooking time.

My family loved this and most of them usually refuse to eat baked beans! This recipe is very easy to prepare, and great for kid-helpers. We cooked a pork loin the day before, so we threw in shredded pork pieces and extra onions. We love the simplicity and the versatility of this recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

I was really excited to try this recipe after the rave reviews from everyone. I followed the recipe exactly. Smelled great in the oven, but tasted like plain ol' canned beans with a hint of sweeteness to it. Very disappointed with this recipe and will not make again.

Made this for a work pot luck and they were a huge hit.  I used Cambell's pork and beans as a base and altered the recipe slightly by frying the bacon first and crumbling into the bean mixture before "baking". I sauteed the onions in the bacon grease and dumped the onions along with the bacon grease into the bean mixture.  I cooked in a crock pot on low for 3 hours - perfect!!!

Good recipe in a pinch.  I would definitely make again.  I saut√©ed the onions first, added beans and heated for about 30 more minutes on the stovetop.  I also added real bacon crumbles to give it more bacon and flavor.  I loved the flavor and the family enjoyed it as well.  Had to tweak ingredients a bit to suite our tastes, but really appreciate this recipe to work with!

Great recipe.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.  However, 3 hours in the oven is a bit too long.  I think next time I will reduce the time by half.  I used cinnamon apple sausage instead of bacon as well.  Still tasted great.

I just made these beans yesterday for a Super Bowl Party. Not a single bean left. I added 1/4 cup Bourbon and 1/4 Barbeque sauce and they were pretty much the best baked beans I have ever had.

exactly the taste I was looking for.  My husband and I had a craving for franks and beans but no canned baked beans in the house.  I found this recipe, cut it in half, quickly mixed it up and let everything cook on the stove in a cast iron for about 20 min. to let the onions softened and the sauce reduce. Perfect!  I'm sure it's even better baked in the oven but we were pretty hungry when we started on our quest.

The flavor these were really good, but three hours baking time is way too long!  My husband kept an eye on them for me while I was out, and they got a little too crisy on top.  If I make them again I will keep an eye on them and maybe let them only bake for two hours.

These were very tasty & traditional! I doubled the recipe and added more bacon than called for since we really like the flavor. I also started mine in the slow cooker for 2 hours then transferred to the oven for the last hour. Some people said they were soupy but in that case, they needed to be cooked longer. Thanks Brandi for a great recipe!

This really is an easy, great tasting recipe.  I was pressed for time so I cooked it on top of the stove on low (until the onions were soft), while I prepared the rest of the meal.  The sauce thickened up nicely.  I didn't use the molasses...and started with chili beans instead of pork and beans since that's all I had on hand.  It turned out to be very tasty, very easy, and very quick!!

I made this and it wasn't even eatable. It was right down awful. I will go back to just throwing my brown sugar, onions, pork and beans, bacon, BBQ sauce and catsup  in a baking dish and mixing to taste. Wouldn't have even given it one star but wouldn't allow me to post without doing so.

I thought it was delicious! Best recipe I have used for doctored up beans. I did double the recipe and added more bacon just because but the sugar and molasses were good amounts. I put it in the crock pot and let them thicken up all day so I didn't have to heat up my house. These were much better than any Bush's beans I have tried!

These were exactly what I was hoping for when I made this recipe! All they needed was a little chopped green pepper and they could have been straight from my beloved Grandma's oven! I didn't chop the bacon, just laid 5 strips across like my mom makes. A snap to make, 5 stars all they way.

Delicious! Used a bit more onions since I was only fixing for our family and we love onions. Used three strips of bacon that I just placed across the top (didn't chop). Have also made and used three cans of beans and turned out well, just used generous amounts of ingredients listed.

Used these for my son's wedding reception. Everyone loved them. So easy to do. Made them in a large electric roaster. We did 75 servings and had some left over. Used leftovers the next weekend for Girl Scout picnic and still got great comments. Will keep for other potluck dinners.

This is an all time great!  I made this for my daughter's first birthday party cookout.  Instead of a casserole dish, I used 2 9X13 inch baking pans and I kept the bacon whole and laid it across the top.  Several people asked for the recipe and many accepted my offer to take the leftovers home with them.  Thanks Brandi!

My go to recipe for baked beans. The brown sugar is overkill, it really doesn't need it so I leave it out. The molasses makes it perfectly sweet and tangy.

My husband is a big fan of baked beans, so, I thought I would give this version a try.   I think the addition of the molasses made the beans taste more like a slow cooked baked bean recipe made with dried beans.   I do think that three hours would be too long to bake.  I baked mine 1-1/2 hrs and they were perfect.  If I had cooked any longer they would have been really dry. I did partially cook the bacon first and sprinkle on top mid way in so the beans did not get too greasy and the bacon stayed slightly crisp.

first time making homemade beans i used grandma brown beans, added some salt pork along with bacon. used a smaller pan (8 by 8). found to be a better size. this recipe only feeds 3-4 people. so now i want to make a much larger dish for a family picnic and would like to cook it in crock pot.  i want to do 4x the batch in crock pot, so if someone has made this in  a crock pot, i would like to know how much you made and how long it took you cooked in pot. also was a big hit.

Not sure what happened here. I am a reasonably good cook and followed the recipe to a "T". When I took the covered casserole out of the oven after 3 hours, all liquid was absorbed, and the beans were burnt. Lots of burnt black in my casserole. The problem is not my oven - I've never had a problem before and recipes typically turn out the way they were intended. Sorry! Won't be making this one again.

I recalculated the dish for 20 folk and it was absolutely delicious. I had a full half of aluminum pan and the entire pan was eaten up.  My guests were very surprised and they raved about them all night. The perfect level of sweetness

These were delicious!  I baked for an additional hour because I don't like my beans runny.  Probably could have gotten away with 1/2 hour.  Very rich, southern flavor.  Everyone devoured them.  Great recipe!!!

Don't get it.  These are sub mediocre.  Two stars is generous.  I cooked the bacon first, cooked onions in bacon fat, and followed recipe from there.  BORING!  Keep looking.

This recipe was easy and delicious! I received many compliments on this dish! Definitely have to cook this for the entire 3 hours (or more depending on the servings). I also added more onions and fresh garlic for added taste, and pre-cooked the bacon as well.

2.25.20 O-M-G please do NOT plan on baking these beans for anywhere close to 3 hours or you will have a dish full of totally dried beans and burnt bacon.  I checked at 1 hour, not quite done, added another 20 minutes, and yep, that did it..  They will firm up a bit as they sit.   The bacon was browned and had added its good flavor to the beans, and the consistency was spot on right for us, just about perfect for baked beans.  Initially, I was a little confused by the listing for the canned beans.  It says ‚Äùbaked beans with pork‚Äù?   I thought would that be a can of beans Bush‚Äôs¬Æ baked beans, but then,  they‚Äôre good-to-go right out of the can, no seasoning required.   At any rate, I used 2 cans of pork and beans,  and I think that was  the submitter‚Äôs intent. For personal taste, I did cut the molasses and brown sugar in half.  Indeed, they are very simple to make, and they are very tasty, as well.  Good baked beans, just watch your time.

Made exactly as written with the addition of liquid smoke. I did double the recipe. I worried about the length of the cook time, but that thickens it up perfectly. It was a big hit with everyone.

This recipe is a keeper.  I followed the advise of some of the others who had made it  and used half the brown sugar and molasses.  I cooked the bacon and onion first as I used my slow cooker.  There were none left!

To speed up the process, brown the bacon on stove top, add to beans before putting in oven.  Check in 45 minutes this way.

I loved the flavor of the beans!  We ended up short on time, so they only baked about two hours instead of the three.  They were runny coming out of the oven, but after sitting 10 - 15 minutes, they got thick and were perfect.  I will make them again for sure!

This is basically the same recipe that I use except that I drain the pork and beans before mixing them in with the other ingredients.   This eliminates the "soupiness" that other posters have mentioned.

We loved it!  The beans do become quite thick.  I removed it from the oven at 2 and a half hours. If you like more sauce, watch it and remove it from the oven sooner. I used a shallow casserole dish, rather than a deep dish. What type of dish you choose to bake it in affects the time.

I made this last night and baked it covered ceramic dish on the barbecue. There was no way I was going to fire up the oven in this heat. 

I forgot to add the ketchup, but, otherwise made the recipe as written, except, I fried the bacon on the stove and browned the onions in the bacon grease. Kind of a cardiologist's nightmare, but, boy did it taste good.

This is exactly how I make mine. I buy the most inexpensive cans of pork and beans and add all the rest. I usually taste it as I go along to make sure it isn't overly sweet. I also "bake" it in the microwave which cuts the time in half. It cooks up nice and thick the way old fashion beans cook when they are baked in the oven for hours.

The only changes I made was I cut up the bacon (4 slices), fried it with the onions, and added to the rest of the ingredients .  They were a hit.

This is very similar to our family recipe with a few substitutions -- we use Colman's Dry Mustard, and finely chopped onions, and we cook the diced bacon before adding to the mixture,. I have always used several cans of baked beans -- a mixture of Bush's, Van Camps, and what ever else is available. I do not always add molasses, just taste to make sure of how sweet the beans are.  I do drain the cans of beans otherwise it becomes too sloppy.

I fry the bacon until ALMOST fully cooked. Then cut slices in half and layer on top before baking.  they crisp up nicely.  Bake 350 for 1/2 hr uncovered. I also had a couple quick shots of Liquid Smoke and maple syrup.

I wanted a thick baked bean recipe like mom use to make and have finally found it. I saw another recipe that served the beans over white rice and my family loved it.  The next time I serve it I'm going to serve it over angel hair spagetti sort of like Skyline Chili. Why not?

i make this a few times a year. the reason that it takes so long to cook is YOU HAVE to drain the beans. you're just wasting all that time cooking all the water out of it. it cooks in an hour if you drain the beans...

I agree with the previous reviewer who found this to be too sweet. That reviewer may be right in wondering if it was supposed to be pork and beans in the recipe instead of canned baked beans.

Took me back to my youth. The only changes I made were - use regular pork and beans instead of baked beans, and add celery equal to the amount of onion (I used a bit more than the recipe). Great taste and plenty of compliments.

 As we were camping, I cooked it on low in a small crockpot for 6 hours...  It was a huge hit with adults and children alike!

This is the simplest recipe for beans. I cooked it on the stove (due to time constraint) but it turned out perfect. Will use this recipe from now on. Thanks.

These baked beans are hit with us.  Made it with no changes to recipe.  The best!  Recently made these beans in crock pot due to hot summer heat.  Set pot on low for 4 hours than removed lid and turned to high for 1 hour...perfect.

I was smoking ribs on my kamado joe so i just put all of the ingredients in a small saucepan and put them on the grill beside the ribs over indirect heat while the ribs smoked for 3 hours or so. Came out great and really absorbed the smoke from the kamado. Highly recommended.

I use a can of beans, not drained, and half all the other ingredients. Start by sweating the onion in the bottom of a sauce pan (I do use 1/4 cup) and then all all the other ingredients, set on low and let simmer until you are ready ton serve. Perfect! Just the right amount for two people. Any beans will do; I like the mixed-beans.

This is the second time I've used this recipe but I made a few changes. I like to read the comments before I jump on in so this is what I came up with.
Instead of the pork and beans I've used navy beans to cut down on the sweetness. I cooked the bacon and then use the grease to saute onions and serrano pepper. I then added  everything on the ingredient list together, including green onions and baked away. Now these are magical beans!

Really good, but with some modifications. Cook the bacon first, then cook onion in the bacon grease and add the lot of it to the beans. I also add liquid smoke, red wine vinegar and Worcestershire to cut the sweetness a bit. I am always asked to bring these "famous beans" to family gatherings.

For somebody who doesn't cook very often and wanted to make a really nice Memorial Day dinner with his girlfriend, this was a perfect recipe! I used Bush's Vegetarian Baked Beans and Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce and they were amazing! Highly recommended.

Made this for a party of 30. Followed the recipe measurements exactly using All Recipes conversion. Saut√©ed bacon and onions prior to combining ingredients in crockpot. Cooked on high for about 3-4 hours. Everyone loved them. They are on the sweet side but that's how I prefer them.

Yes I have I have tried theses and thought they were missing a few important elements .Like bacon I would use brown or molasses one or the other , other it is to sweet. I think the bacon would add more savory flavor and may a 1/2 teaspoon of Hickory smoke.
