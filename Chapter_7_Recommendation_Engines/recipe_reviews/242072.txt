Made it just as it was described - We loved it! I especially liked the (madigascar) vanilla in the glaze - Very nice addition to a glaze topping., Nice recipe

I made a third of a cup (or so) extra of the brown sugar, flour, oat mix.  I sprinkled that on top of the rhubarb then I added the sugar, corn starch, water thickened glaze. 
I made this as a dessert for friends and got rave reviews!! Several guests agreed that I could/should make that again!

I added about 2 cups of berries to this and it was great and also I didn't use the white sugar I used 1/2 cup honey 1/4 cup honey would have worked also
