Folks, I haven't tried this particular recipe, but repeatedly see that people have trouble with the breading falling off.  I did too until I read that your heat is too high.  You need to cook it lower and slower!

I made a composite of this recipe.  Instead of putting the majority of the seasonings in the gravy, I put them all in the flour mix.  Doing that and following the steps of dredging in flour, egg, then flour again, this made the most fantastic chicken fried steak I have ever had!  My fiance loved this, as well, claiming it was also the best he'd ever had.  It was definitely awesome!

As several other reviewers have suggested, seriously consider reducing the chili powder by at least half.  The chili powder overwhelms the gravy taste.  I had to add more milk to reduce the intensity of the chili powder, though once tempered, the flavor of the gravy rocks.  I had to add several eggs to the egg mixture.  There wasn't enough egg batter for the meat.  Too, consider leaving the flour out of the egg.  Yes, it might make the coating thicker, but it is VERY hard to work with and doesn't stick easily to the meat.  My mother always dipped the meat in egg alone and I think that works best.  I bought tenderized round steak on sale, which also is what mom used.  All in all--an excellent recipe, with with the modifications just mentioned.

Came out great, except I omitted chili and cayenne, just added a little black pepper instead.  Also didn't use flour in the egg mix, just dredged meat in flour, then egg, then flour again. My family really enjoyed it, EVEN my mother-in-law liked it!!!

I am a huge chicken fried steak fan! This was quite different than the usual (white gravy) recipe I am used to. However,I would recommend that the chili powder be reduced...it was a bit overwhelming.

Ty had a craving for chicken fried steak and being that I've only made it once before, I decided to try a different recipe. The gang loved it although I did do the bread crumb thing in addition to the flour. I deleted the "salt" part of the seasonings and added a can of Golden Mushroom Soup" to the gravy. The girls and hubby devoured the cube steaks I used and the delicious gravy laden mashed spuds. Terrific Gail!

This was a great work night meal, my family loved the taste. The only thing I would suggest is to detail the gravy for the less than beginners like me, I think the amount of flour was a tad! to much. Thanks for the recipe will make again.

I cooked this for my whole family and they loved it!  Even my three year old wanted seconds. The gravy is pretty spicey, so if you have little ones you might want to cut back on the chili powder.  The steaks had kick to them, but not too much.  I don't know how some people have had problems with the breading.  This is the first recipe that I've used where you actually get a nice coat of breading.  Great recipe!!

Excellant and very easy.  This will go into regular rotation.  I changed the spices to what I like but this is a very easy recipe to adjust.

Secret - Use a cast iron pan for frying.  This turned out excellent!  I did not make this gravy however.  I had 1-1/2 pounds of cube steak and 1/2'd the recipe.  Though I did use a total of three eggs and I did put approx. 1/4 cup of flour in the eggs.  I thought it worked perfectly.  The batter was not too thick, but the crispy covering it made to the steaks was scrumdelicious.  We all chowed down on this one.  Mashed Potatoes and corn was perfect.  And some garlic cheese biscuits!  Heavenly.

4 stars for breading-5 stars for the gravy! An easy and quick way to make my husband's chicken fried steak fix. I halved the recipe for just the two of us. Added a little tabasco to the egg wash to up the heat even more. Loved the spicy milk gravy! I left about 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet and still had to add about another Tblsp. butter to the flour to get a nice roux, and that was with less flour.

Great recipe! next time, I'll cut the cayenne by half.  I prefer it with a little less heat.

Did not cook right.  I didn't have any eggs so I substituted mayo and water.  The first batch was a disaster.  The third batch was just plain breading and tasted good.  This was just not worth the bother.

This is a good basic recipe but there were parts I left out.  I tried to dip it in the flour mix with eggs but it ended up being such a goo glob that I ended up adding water to it to get it to work.  I don't like a coating of eggs underneath the batter. Also, under the advice of others I didn't put in the hot pepper spices in the gravy.  The gravy turned out great otherwise.

This is the first Allrecipes recipe that I did not like. I followed the recipe, except only used 2 teaspoons of salt like other reviewers suggested. The breading did NOT stay on the steak. The gravy was very salty, even after cutting it down so much. The breading had very good flavor, so it is a shame that it wouldn't stay on the steak. My sons tried, but couldn't eat more than a few bites. My husband thought it was okay, but too salty.  I won't be making this again.

I have been making this recipe for at least the last two years and We love it so much that I also use it for Chicken breasts! I never have a problem with the coating sticking to the meat and this has to be my familys favorite meal!  We like it so much I went to see what other delish recipes Gail123 may have but this is the only one.  Come on Gail post some more of you fab recipes!!   I usually serve this over rice or mashed potato.  The gravy is fabulous!

This was yummy. My husband thought it was great, very tender. My only complaint was that the cube steak was not seasoned enough. I did not make the gravy so that may of been why. Instead I bought the package gravy that you make by adding water.

I'm not a big beef person, but I had some given to us by family that needed to be cooked. That being said, my boyfriend and my kids LOVED these chicken fried steaks. I left everything the same, except I didn't add flour to the egg and I halved the chili powder so it wasn't too spicy for the kids. I liked the breading and gravy a lot, as did everyone else. The girls' have already had leftovers for lunch today.

Guess I should've read the reviews, but I was in a rush. The breading really did not stick to the steak, I found the breading itself to be lacking some flavour as well. I appreciate the recipe but not sure if I'll try it again with the advice in the reviews..

Made this last night and Mom & hubby loved it. I thought it was just okay but who can resist rave reviews. I followed others suggestions and skipped the cayenne and chili and dredged the meat in seasoned flour, egg and flour again. Even though I decreased the flour, the gravy was still thick as glue so keep a little liquid handy for thinning. I was out of potatoes but they loved the gravy over rice. Thx for submitting this one Gail.

Very good!  The coating was wonderful!  Did not make the gravy.  Served with traditional cream gravy, mashed potatoes, and green beans.  A true southern comfort food!

It was time consuming to make this recipe, but worth the time. My husband and kids loved it. Next time I will put 1/2 tbsp. of chili powder in the gravy because the 2 tbsp's are overwhelming.

A first timer for Chicken Fried Steak but not to frying or gravy.  Followed the recipe and found that it called for FAR too much flour for the gravy.  The flour-then egg-then flour really helped the chicken fried steak and next time I will only brown some of the remaining flour before adding the milk/spice mixture for the gravy.  After adding too much flour, I simply added a lot of water to make a nice gravy and will keep the rest for some leftover fried chicken that I have to eat tomorrow night.

I adjusted to serve 2. The prep of meat and frying ( used crisco) was very simple, crust stayed on and had a nice crispy texture. I did not care for the gravy, will keep looking for another one. I served with egg noodles and Sauteed Garlic Asparagus also fun this site.

Best chicken fried steak recipe I have ever made or tasted. Adding the flour to the egg wash made all the difference in the world. I did use blackened seasoning instead of cayenne pepper (didn't have on hand) plus some onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, & pepper to the flour. Excellent recipe, thanks!!!

Much better than other recipes I tried.  I foolishly thought you needed to soak the steak in a batter to get a good coating.  Live and learn!  =)

I used this recipe as my FIRST attempt at Chicken Fried Steak.  Overall, for my first time, it came out decent.  I followed the suggestions and breaded with flour, egg & then flour again.  I also took the suggestion of a reviewer and fried low and slow and my breading did well at staying on.  The gravy had a bite to it.  Hubby LOVED it.  I had a hard time getting gravy to thicken, but I think that has more to do with my experience is making gravy, rather than the recipe.  Overall, it's a good recipe.  I have alot more to learn with the art of Chicken Fried Steak.  Lucky for me, my hubby doesn't mind being my taste tester...haha!

The breading was far too salty and the gravy recipe must be off on the chili powder.

This is a great recipe.  For someone who doesn't fry many foods, this is worth it.  I've made it with or without the gravy.  Simply delicious!

This was WAY too salty.  We even left out almost half the salt it called for.  I would make the meat again (not the gravy) but not put more than a sprinkle of reg salt in with the flour.  The cayanne pepper gave it the right kick.  With a little tweaking (and without the salt!) this will be tons better.

I have always wanted to make Chicken Fried steak but this was my first attempt.  The flavor was wonderful!  My family loved it...but the breading fell off the steak, maybe I dried them off too much ... will definately experiement some more with this.

I have been making the steak part of this recipe for about 6 years and love the way the steak turns out. I add an extra egg to the egg mixture, but do everything else same. I've never had a problem with the breading falling off. I made the gravy for the first time last week and it was terrible. I am going to give it another try, but only put two teaspoons of salt in the flour mixture and reduce the chilli powder. I also didn't need all the left over flour for the gravy...It would be nice to have an exact measurement on the flour needed in case you don't make as many steaks. I think this will be awesome when i get it figured out!

Very very good.  I did not use the beef boullion but it was still very good.  It was almost as good as the "saltine" based recipes.  I used paula deens house seasoning mix recipe (on food network) in the flour mixture.

I was curious about the gravy to this recipe and why add flour to the eggs so I thought I would give this a try.  I would not recommend adding flour to the eggs and the gravy was a huge flop to all of us and ended up making my regular cream gravy after tossing this gravy.  The steak came out ok but will stick to my regular recipe.  For those that had trouble keeping the breading on the steak, make sure your oil is hot enough, about 350 degrees.

MY FAMILY LOVES THIS DISH. WE HAVE ALWAYS USE CUBED STEAK AND SEASON REALLY WELL BEFORE BREADING. WE DEEP FRY OURS BECAUSE THEY HOLD UP BETTER THAN PAN FRYING AND TURN OUT WITH A BETTER GOLDEN BROWN CRUST. MY MOM GOT US HOOKED ON USING LOUISIANA HOT SAUCE AND A.1. STEAK SAUCE INSTEAD OF WITH GRAVY AND EVERYONE IN OUR FAMILY LOVES IT THAT WAY. THROW IN SOME CORN ON THE COB, TATERS (YOUR CHOICE FRIED OR MASHED - THEY BOTH WORK GOOD WITH THIS DISH), SOME BLACKEYED PEAS, AND SOME STEWED MATERS AND YOUR ALL SET! MAN I BET YOU CAN TELL I'M FROM THE SOUTH, HUH? ENJOY!

Do not add flour to egg. I ended up with a gelatinous mess that was very difficult to get on the steak.

Made in a cast iron skillet with shortening instead of oil. Kind of a pain to make but taste very good

Sounded like a good idea, but my execution was horrible.  Like some other users, the breading refused to stay on the steak and just dispersed around the oil.  The gravy also tasted like dirt for some reason.  I am guessing i did something wrong, and I made a single serving rather than 3 lbs.  Oh well.

Very good.   I did one extra step which seemed to help keep the "breading" on.  After dredging, let the meat sit for 10 to 15 minutes.

The flavor of the breading on the steaks is great. I had to dump the gravy. It should say, use 1/2 cup of the flour mixture with 2 cps of milk. It just says use leftover flour mixture, so i dumped it all in there...not good. Also I agree with the other reviews about cutting the chili powder in half, I would also recommend using less salt.

Very disappointing!!!  Gravy and coating had way too much salt.  Too much flour to make the gravy.  It was way to thick and had to add a lot more milk than called for.  Would not make it again.  Also very time consuming and messy for the poor results.

easy to follow, but very salty.  if i were to try this recipe again, I'd cut the salt to 3/4ths teaspoon.  2 is way too much.

Loved this recipe. I have never tried making Chicken Fried Steak before and it was rather easy with this recipe. BF loved it - said I was turning into a really good cook and that it tasted like restaurant quality (he meant that as a compliment). Although I reduced the amount of flour in the egg, it was difficult to work with and I will not put flour in the egg next time.

Note to self (others, as well): I had 4 pcs of cubed steak (didn't look at weight on pkg). I didn't use all the required flour. I prefer not adding flour to the egg mix (made it too thick). I took someone else's advice and added the seasoning into the flour mix, which ended up in the gravy, but everything is so flavorful. I'm not a beginning level cook, but still require measurements. However, I eyeballed my other measurements. Because I used 1 c. Flour, I thought 1 c. Milk would suffice. However, I kept adding milk, which would've probably been the 2 1/2 c.
Thank you to the submitter for this recipe!

The meat was tender and the breading stayed on nicely. Gravy a little lumpy but I didn't measure anything. Still tasted great!

Definitely worth making again! Just a few changes will be made next time. The oil should not be added all at once, as the first steak soaked it all up (greasy) then there was not enough left for the others. Second, I agree that the gravy should be more detailed - the amount of flour left over can vary too much (ours was waaaay too strong on the flour). Make sure you know the basics of flour making beforehand, as it would be easy to make lumpy gravy if you're not practiced. As for positives, the taste was great! We loved the chili powder in place of pepper (we're huge pepper fans, but this was a different taste than normal that worked really well!). The egg mixture worked out really well for us, with no problem of breading falling off (but we used farm eggs that are generally more sticky yolks and make breading a snap!). The temperature seemed great for us. We halved the salt and ommitted celery salt and it still tasted great. Overall, we'll make it again with some slight changes!

I love chicken fried steak cooked this this with only a few changes. I don't use garlic on the chicken. And I make just plain country cowboy gravy. Use the lard fry up the steaks and please no seasoning . No garlic,hot sauce, no celery, no beef bullion,and no chili powder.Add about TABLESPOON OF SUGAR .When cooking you gravy- stir till your flour turns golden brown then slowly pour in your  your.

I have made this recipe several times and it tastes great!  Tends to be a flakier crust than the local restaurants that specialize in chicken fried everything (I'm in Texas), but I like it better that way.  Makes a giant mess, and I sometimes have to increase the amount of eggs to keep the egg coating thin enough to (1) coat all the pieces and (2) not be so heavy that the coating falls off the meat.

We really enjoyed this for dinner. I didn't change anything other than throwing all the spices in the flour rather than adding them to the gravy it just seemed easier that way and I sliced some into strips so the kids could have steak fingers. No problems with the breading falling off and all around yummy chicken fried steak recipe.

I believe this is the first recipe from this site that I was disappointed in.  Although the steaks themselves were okay, the Egg/Flour was close to impossible to deal with.  There are no words to describe the gravy!!  I'm not that experienced a cook so I follow a recipe the first time to a T, but even I knew(but still foolish'ly did) 2 tbsp of chilli powder was way too much!

I love reading the reviews that are posted on these recipes. For me they are very helpful. I changed this recipe in the followidng ways, I used only 2 lbs of meat and then I mixed up my flour mixture and took 1/2 cup of that and added it to my 3 eggs. I also diluted the pasty egg mixture with a small amount of milk to a med paste consistancy. Lastly I only added 1/4 tsp of the cayenne to the flour mixture and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. My son, who is 10, will be the first one to point out if somethigang is too salty. Turned out pretty good and had no problems with coating sticking.

I thought this was a great recipe, the only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because I didn't think it browned up with such a thick coating, but I loved the gravy and the meal as a whole.

This recipe was a bit too spicy for the kiddos.  I only used a dash of cayenne.  My husband loves it.  We live in a town with a diner specializing in chicken fried steak but he would rather me make this recipe.

Great steak, awful gravy!

The gravy is so salty you can't taste anything else in the meal - it is more like taco seasoning. I love spicy dishes, but this tastes like cheap fast food.

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe as directed.  The gravy had too much chili powder in it.  The 2nd time I halved the chili powder.  I still think the chili powder overpowered it.  I should have thinned out the gravy w/ water or milk as suggested by another reviewer.  Personally I prefer a white gravy on my chicken fried steak.

i have never made this chicken fried steak before in my life, this recipe had it's hits and misses.  i loved the extra flavor the cayanne added to the breading however the gravy was just too much working against the flavor of the steak.  even cutting half of the chili powder out like other reviews suggested still didn't dull the chili powder flavor, it over powered the entire meal so much so that my son said that it was too spicey.  next time i am anxious to keep the breading recipe but try the steak with a white gravy.

Pretty good- my first attempt at chicken fried steak and my husband LOVED it!  Not too hard to do- just have to watch the heat on the stove top and babysit it for a while so not to over cook.

I did as others suggested and added all the spices to the flour mixture and cut out the salt. The flavor was good, according to my southern-born husband! Thanks! However, I will not follow the recipe next time and add all the leftover flour to the gravy mix. I had a gloppy mess. Which was probably my own fault, as I should have added it more gradually. Anyway, I wound up just whipping up a batch of my own country gravy.But overall the recipe was very good. Thank you!!!

This is the first time I ever made chicken fried steak.  The steak part was delicious, the coating stayed on.  I used Canola oil to cook with.  Next time tho, use 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and way less salt.  Omit the garlic and celery salt.  The gravy was too salty.  Also, less chili powder, it made it too spicy.  I've served it with mashed potatoes (with butter and vanilla yogurt) instead of sour cream and milk.  Next time I make it, I'll make country gravy instead.  Otherwise, the meat came out perfectly. Thank You.

I used this recipe on pork chops, and it worked great!  I didn't have beef bouillon on hand, so I used chicken stock for the gravy and it was still a huge hit with my family.  Thanks!

Very likely the best chicken fried steak I have ever made.  I added a dash of Tabasco to the egg and omitted the celery salt in the gravy, substituted onion powder for the garlic salt and sprinkled gravy-laden steaks with paprika.  Thanks Gail!

Let me try this one more time.  Loved the steak and breading.  That turned out great, but the gravy was not so good.  I added only 1 1/2 tsp of chili powder and no cayenne pepper and it was still overpowering.  I also had to add a bunch of extra milk to the gravy because it was like paste.  Probably that was partly my fault as gravy is tough for me, but I would definately cut down on the chili powder.

Big hit...will be a regular meal at our house.  All kids and adults loved this.  Served with a gravy made from the drippings and mashed Potatoes.  What a quick, easy and great tasting meal! Thanks for a great recipe.

This was my first time making chicken fried steak, however I have fried things before and I had a hard time getting the meat to cook all the way through.  99% of the time I follow recipes exactly as printed and I get a wonderful meal.  This recipe was vague for novice cooks.  My husband will eat anything and he hated the gravy and thought the steak was okay, but refused to eat the leftovers.

This was great!  Nice crispy coating that stayed on the meat perfectly. Even my 16 month old ate it and he wont eat meat!!!

Excellent.  The breading was quite good, and it stayed on perfectly.  If the recipe is followed EXACTLY, you will have no problems.  The breading gave the steak a very good flavor which is usually my biggest complaint.  We didn't make the gravy because my family is not a fan of it.  It was a nice comfort food night.

Ok chicken fried steak. I lived in the south and ate a lot of chicken fried steak and this is not the best I've had but it is quick and easy to make. I would leave out the celery salt, didn't like the taste it gave the sauce. White gravy is also much better.

My family loved this! My Husband asks for it all the time. Even my 3 year old asked for seconds! Definitely a family favorite!
