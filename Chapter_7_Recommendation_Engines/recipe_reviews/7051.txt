Although it always tastes great, I've tried this recipe 3 times and it always over-rises during the 'rise' phase and collapses during baking.  This is a typical symptom of forgetting the salt so on try 2 I was SURE to add the salt. Same problem.  I gave it one last try with same result.

Indeed, this bread was very robust, had the good flavor of whole wheat + rye, and a very, very subtle taste of molasses. Next time I bake it though, I'll use the whole wheat setting of my machine, so that it rises a bit more. P.S.: as already mentioned, dough will rise hugely during the first knead, but not that much after the second one.

I made this as written, it made a nice light loaf with a nutty taste. The humidity is low now in January but I will definitely decrease the yeast in the summer - every loaf rises too much then. But for now it was perfect. Edit: Since my review I've made this countless times; it's my favourite bread recipe. Even my gluten-intolerant mother in law can't resist it!!

The recipe gave a light, slightly sweet bread.  I really enjoyed the flavor!

Not the best whole wheat I've had, but pretty close.  I substituted white whole wheat for the rye flour and did 1 1/2 T honey and 1/2 T molasses.  I omitted the sugar (mainly because I forgot) and used butter instead of margarine.  I also baked it in the oven instead of the bread machine.  Worked great.  I also added some gluten to the mixture.  It was still a bit sticky as dough and a bit crumbly cooked, but not terribly so.  I will likely use this again.

I tried this for the first time last night.  It was easy to prepare and the results were fantastic! I did the second rising in a baking pan and baked it at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  It rose beautifully and has a nice light taste.  This is a keeper, for sure! Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this one. I baked it in an 8 x 4 pan in a 350 oven for 30 minutes. I let it rise twice and added about 1/4 c. gluten to it as well. I could taste the rye and molasses, but they're not overpowering.
