I love this very moist fruitcake. I got so many compliments on it! It is very moist! I baked mine in a bunt pan and a bread pan. It took 1 1/2 to bake at 300. I added 1/2 cup whiskey to one of them. Because it is already moist, I was afraid to pour the whiskey over top but I did and people said it was the best fruitcake they have ever eaten!! Next time I will add a little more fruit. It is more "cakey" than "fruity" But I appreciate the recipee....It made me look like such a good baker!! I will make this year after year!

I had never made fruitcake before, so this was a first, for me. I decided to give this recipe a shot, because of your little blurb about the cake :). I followed the recipe exactly, but cut down the fruit+nuts (family's not too big on it), and it turned out perfect! It was moist, not too sweet, and so aromatic! I am surprised this has only one review so far. I'll be making this often & thanks for sharing this family recipe :)

this is fabulous! I knew I was going to like it for the fact that it was made with applesauce and oil. I am not a fan of clove so only added 1tsp but added some fresh grated nutmeg and allspice too. Used special dark choc. You don't taste the choc but it seems to enhance the flavor of the spices and fruit. I played around with the fruit and added some orange essence cranberries from trader Joe's, cran cherries,dates, and the candied fruit. I soaked them the night before in triple sec with a few cinnamon sticks and the zest of 1 orange.  The result of the applesauce and oil is a moist moist cake without being heavy fruitcake. It's even better the next day. had to bake for about 1 hr and 15 min. made 1 bundt and 1 bread loaf. It is just so yummy.  thank you so much.
