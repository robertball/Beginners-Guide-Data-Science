I have also been making these mice for years and everyone always comments on how cute they are! They make a great addition to my Christmas cookie plates. I also just use semi-sweet chocolate chips for dipping and just use a tube of icing for the eyes.

I like to sit them on an open oreo cookie. Easy to pick up from a treat tray. Thanks for talking the time to write out the recipe lovemykids.This year I made the ears out of chocolate melts so the nuts would not be a proublem for grandson.

Love these.  I made sure my cherries and kisses were cold.  I put the almonds on the kisses prior to dipping the cherries, this made the assembly easier.
Make sure the chocolate is not too hot or everything will slip.  I put cute white eyes on the Christmas mice and used gel for the beady red eyes for Halloween.

These are SO fun to make and SO cute! I make this recipe every Christmas and put a few on every Christmas tray, it makes a nice Nutcracker theme! But they are also cute at Halloween or anytime! I never use the red dots. They work best when you make them with friends so you can do an assembly line, or else the chocolate hardens too fast. If you can't make them with friends then only make a few at a time for the best result. I also like to line up the "ears" in advance, that way they are about equal sizes. They are not the most tasty, but they are still so fun! Also if you want the face and body to be similar color use 1/2 melted kisses for dunking the cherries, this will help. Have fun!

I've made this for years.  I use almond bark.  A good way to separate the Oreos is to use dental floss.  Please make sure you pick up almond SLICES.  I sent my other half to get slices and he picked up SLIVERS, which were thin rectangles.  The kids love to make these.

I have been making these for years. I usually just use chocolate chips for dipping, they work great.   I just made some mice for halloween, I used white chocolate to dip the cherries and white chocolate kisses for heads, gave them all red eyes and fangs, they looked really good, wish now that I had taken a picture so I could post it. But I will be making them again soon for Christmas, I'll be sure to take a picture then.  You can easly change up the color and flavor just by the type of kisses you use, such as the cookies and cream, and remember that if you can't find a chocolate to match for dipping you can melt kisses and use that to dip your cherries.  These are very cute and tasty and always recive lot's of praise.

These are adorable and go together pretty fast.  Instead of sliced almonds which break easily I used chocolate chips for ears and piped on a bit of pink decorating icing along with a pink dot for nose. And white eyes.  Try to get some nice big stemmed cherries for the body.  I got two big jars from Costco.

my friend makes these with brandied cherries. He puts red dots for eyes and calls them plague rats. I have made them  with white chocolate and the white swirl kisses and called them lab rats.

Just made these for the ladies at a retirement home.  Last month they got the Penguins from this website...this month the mice.  I like the idea of the decorating candies...I used gel icing and I'm afraid it will smear.  Use the sliced almonds, not the slivered for the cutest ears...

Made these for an RV rally, and they were the hit of the potluck.  Just not enough to go around.  need to get 2 jars of cherry's next time.  Hardest park was finding the cherry's with stems!  Finally found them at Smart and Final!  Who would have guest!

My family always enjoys making these each year. We've made it a fun family tradition to make these every Christmas for family and friends. Everyone is always impressed with how professional they look and they think we spent a long time fussing over it. This is a wonderful recipe.

So cute, my 11 yo wanted to make these for her dads cake on Fathers day. He hates mice so we had a good laugh. She also put chocolate sprinkles all over the cake for little mouse poops.

These are ADORABLE! Actually made them several times - exactly as instructed by the author - and they are a big hit! There are no children in my world, but all the adults that have seen/received/consumed them can't stop cooing over their cuteness. So easy to make for such a big impact.

These are adorable to add a few to cookie trays for neighbors and coworkers. They are so easy and always impressive and a big hit with the kids! I find it easier to buy a small tube of red gel and black gel frosting to add the red nose and black eyes.
