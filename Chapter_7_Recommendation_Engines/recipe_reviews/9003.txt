Use cheddar or other cheese in place of "cheese food". Add chili powder to taste. Be sure to save plenty of cheese to put on top. I also like Jalapeno`s and black olives in this recipe too. This is also one of those "even better the next day" dishes. Remember also to cover every bit of the tortillas witht he mixture or they will go very hard.

Mmmmmm...these were delicious.  When hubby goes on these overnight trips for work, I am able to prepare anything I want for dinner.  And I usually lean towards something "mexican" since it is my favorite.  I made a few alterations to this recipe, but my results were fabulous. These are VERY cheesy, so I may reduce the amount to 3/4 of a package next time. I didn't have any canned chicken so I cut up 10 chicken tenderloins and sauteed them in oil.  I replaced the evaporated milk with a 10oz can of enchilada sauce and didn't add the cumin since I was out. I had originally intended to use the mexican style velvetta cheese if I could have found it, but I ended up using the regular.  I only added 1/2 a cup of sour cream and had plenty of sauce to pour over the enchiladas.  Keep in mind...these do not have a "spicy" flavor.  The green chilies only add a small amount of flavor if any at all, so be sure to add your spices accordingly.  You could also melt all of the ingredients together in a crock pot and use this as a dip.  That's exactly what I did with the small amount of chicken and sauce mixture I had left over. Terrific!!  Thanks for sharing Heather.

I loved this dish, and received many compliments and requests for the recipe.  The only thing I did different was add 8oz. chopped green chiles, and used cheddar/jack cheese instead of the processed cheese.  I added green onions on top and sliced black olives. I wish there had been leftovers, I have a craving for this!  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.

This is similar to the way I make my
chicken enchiladas, but almost every
recipe at this site I have seen for these uses flour tortillas.  We live in South Texas and no one has ever heard of using flour tortillas for enchiladas.  We use only corn tortillas.  I'll bet if you try them you will never go back to the flour ones.

delicious. I boiled three chicken breast and shredded them and also added a packet of taco seasoning to the sour cream mixture instead of the cumin. Everyone loved them!

This was good, but I don't know if I would make it again...a little too cheesy for me and thats rare because I love cheese...also, it doesn't have much spice to it, but that could be changed by adding more cumin or maybe even some taco seasoning....

My family loved this!!  Instead of rolling up the tortillas individually, i just layered torn tortillas in the bottom of the dish.  this made it quicker.  i also used jalapeno peppers and another can of soup.  i didn't use 16 oz. of sour cream....only 8.  this dish is a "keeper".

I saw all the reviews stating "too much cheese" and thought, "Blasphemy!  There's no such thing!"  Never again shall I doubt.  There was INDEED far too much cheese in this dish.  Serving it with salsa helped, but next time I will absolutely cut down on the cheese and increase the meat.

My picky children would never eat a green chili pepper, so I pureed them in the blender and then added to my soup/cheese mixture.  You could still taste the peppers, but no one knew they were there.  I was afraid that this recipe would have too much liquid, so I reduced the sour cream by 1/2 and only used one can of soup.  There was still plenty of liquid to cover the enchiladas.

Way too cheesy for me and I'd never thought that was possible.  I'll cut out probably 1/2 the velveeta because there ended up being an excessive amount of sauce.  It was a decent place to start since I'd never tried to make chicken enchiladas before, but as written will not suit my tastes.

If I make again I would definitely double the chicken and cut the amount of cheese sauce in half. Other than that very tasty.

My husband made these, and we all enjoyed them.  Not traditional enchiladas, but yummy in a kid-friendly sort of way.  We added some chopped jalapenos for some kick.  I certainly wouldn't make these for a dinner party, but for a BBQ with kids or a casual family dinner, these are a keeper.

I did as someone suggested and used real cheese -- quite delish! I would definitely add jalapenos next time because it was too mild & bland. I'd use small tortillas too because using 10-inch tortillas I only got 5 enchiladas out of the recipe.

I was surprised by the high reviews of this recipe. It is not a bad recipe in terms of convenience and overall taste, but the amount of processed cheese, canned chicken and soup make for an highly unhealthy meal to provide adults, much less children. By substituting lower fat shredded cheese instead of the processed "cheese loaf" and real chicken instead of canned chicken (for convenience try shreding with a fork or chopping into chunks a portion of a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken readily available in many grocery store), and if you're going all the way, don't use the cream-based soup and instead get the moisture and liquid equivalent from petite-cut canned tomoatoes (not drained).

This recipe is soooooo cheesey! I wish I had realized. While my family is making a go at it, it's almost too much! Next time I will double the chicken (not use canned either) and cut down on the Velveeta. Maybe use shredded instead. Also, some others suggested the Taco seasoning or something for some flavor...I would suggest doing that. It's very cheesey without much "umph!"

This was a okay recipe. I made it for my husband who is hispanic and he thought it taste more like a chimichanga then enchiladas I agree with him. Although it is good it is not authentic enchiladas. And i made it just as the recipe called for my kids however did like it so thats a plus.

Really tasty, I'll make this again, but WATCH THE CHEESE! Yikes...these enchiladas were literally smothered. Next time I will use 1/2 the Velveeta called for and 1/4 of the sour cream. Delicious and filling, but definitely the richest entree I've ever made.

I have made this a few times and my family really loves it served with Mexican rice.  In the sauce I replace the evaporated milk and condensed soup with enchilada sauce.

This was really good I made it for a party and it was gone. I made some minor adjustments - I added Taco seasoning to the sour cream mix, used corn tortilla and double the chicken. It turned out fabulous it is really cheesy but I am big into cheese.

This is the first time I ever had enchiladas- so don't have anything to compare too but we thought these were really good. I did use only half of the processed cheese, because of others suggestions. Will make again.

Love this recipe!
Used a lot less cheese and also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  No one could tell.  Nice, easy, yummy recipe for your family.

I put in less cheese due to other reviews. Still way too cheesy, even the kids mentioned it.  I gave it a 3 because I will use it as a base recipe next time with several changes.

I hate it when people write a review on a recipe that they have altered so much that it is not even the same dish.....but , humbly that it what I am about to do.  I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so I used what I had and used this recipe as a guideline. I used cheddar cheese soup instead of processed cheese for the sauce.  I didn't have but 1/5 cup of sour cream and I used non fat milk instead of evaporated.  Oh!  and I used left over turkey which I chopped into small cubes !! Everything else I did as per the instructions.  My husband loved it.  I poured a little of the sauce on the bottom of a prepared 9 X 13 pan , filled my fajita styled flour tortillas with the meat sauce and a little cheese sauce.  This recipe is generous in portions.  I topped the rolled tortillas with the remaining sauce, topped it with grated cheddar cheese and french fried onion rings.  It was surprisingly very good!!  Quick and easy!!

I could not decide on three or four stars, because I know there are other chicken enchilada recipes that are tastier, and authentic, etc.  But I am giving this recipe four stars, because I wanted: (1) an easy, quick, cheap recipe, (2) using canned chicken for the first time, and (3) I love mexican.  I was doubting this recipe, but it turned out good and was such an easy, cheap, enchilada recipe using canned chicken!

I did modify (as I do based on what I have on hand and my personal tastes - as well as only cooking for two people).  I used the full 10 oz can of chicken, but 1 can of soup and less cheese (which was also various blocks of cheese I had on hand, such as colby-jack and cheddar).  I eyeball-measured the cheese, using a lot less, based on the other reviews, and used salsa instead of evaporated milk, because mine was expired.  I also swirled refried beans on the tortillas before adding the chicken mixture (because I do that with all enchiladas) and added rice (because I always do that too).  

Obviously, this a quickie, easy, cheap recipe that can completely be modified to taste and what's available.  Worth keeping!

It was a great idea generator, and very yummy, a keeper.  I also thought it was a little heavy on the calories/sodium, so I used less cheese, used regular chicken (not canned), used enchilada sauce instead of milk. Next time I will add less cream of chicken soup to the sauce to give it a bit more spice.  Again, thanks for the recipe--I will have many spin-offs recipes from it.   PS: My husband liked it just the way it was.

Should call it Cheesy Cheese Chicken Enchiladas! I didn't have a can of evaporated milk so after warming up the cheese mixture in the microwave I stirred half a can of regular milk. I would put 2 cans of green chilis in next time.

i made a modified version of this recipe, similar i'm sure, as other reviewers.  ground chicken cooked w/ taco seasoning, then i added the soup and milk.  rolled and topped w/ enchilada sauce and baked for a bit.  then i added the sour cream/shredded cheese topping.  excellent!

I LOVE cheese, however, whoa. So over kill we (husband and 3 kids; 5,8 &10) could barely eat it. I mean it tastes good, but maybe pour half the cheese sauce over the tortillas and also some enchilada sauce. Recipe is a good start definitely needs some tweaking!

Ok. Too much cheese and evaporated milk was a "different" addition. So-so reviews from the family.

It ok as it was.  Too cheesy and real no spice.  So with the left over cheesy mix. I have made more chicken mixture add more spice to them.  Waiting for the cheese to warm up so I can add it to the chicken.  Will see how it comes out.

This more like Tex-Mex than "real" Mexican Enchiladas.  I used both cream of Mushroom and cream of Chicken soup.  In addition some cumin, more scallions, a few dashes of hot and garlic powder kick things up a notch or two.  Mexican cuisine is not bland.  In addition I used skinless chicken breasts,  thin sliced and sauteed in olive oil and Sazon (general spicy salt mix) before mixing everything up.  Friends tell me these are the best Enchiladas they have ever eaten.
