I LOVED this! I didn't chop my almonds too fine and did not drain them before putting them over the avocados b/c I wasn't gonna waste that yummy browned butter, but instead drizzled it over the avocados along w/ the nuts. This made a tasty treat and I would def make this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Thank you! I love avocados but sometimes eating them all by themselves can be a challenge. I loved this and it really was fast and easy! Watch out though, they burn quick!

Nice alternate way to eat up the avocados.  The only change I made was I added a small amount of minced garlic to the butter and almonds. Very good, Ty for sharing.

Quick, easy, and delicious. I put mine over pasta tonight, but it would be great on its own.
