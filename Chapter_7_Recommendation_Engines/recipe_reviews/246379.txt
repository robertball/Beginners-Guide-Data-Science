3.19.16   I didn't add the sweetener, since I didn't think it needed it.  I'll never understand why anybody buys bottles of Thousand Island Dressing.  It's so easy to make, and this recipe is a good one for it.  Thanks for sharing.

This review is for my husband because he's the one I made this for.  He really liked it.  I only added a pinch of the sugar and thought it needed something so added a dash of Tabasco.  I think tomorrow I'll hardboil some eggs and add one to the 1/2 batch I made for him.  I agree with lutzflcat in that homemade dressings are so easy and so much better than store-bought ones!  Every once in a while I'll buy one for my husband, but we always go back to the homemade ones!  (Me?  Oil and vinegar here!).  Thanks for this recipe!  My hubby thanks you!

This is a good recipe and basically one I’ve been making for years, learned from my mother in law.
Something I’ve also done for years, in the event that you just need a small amount like for a Reuben, because it does not save forever.....is to mix some mayonnaise and ketchup together, just eyeball the amount, with there being more mayonnaise than ketchup.  Works for me!

This is just like my grandmother's ( my grandfather's favorite).  We never bought thousand island salad dressing.  It is good on Rueben's also.

Hubby loves Thousand Island dressing and this is his new favorite; mine, too.   I added about a teaspoon of sugar, rather than the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure it really needs the sugar.   I used my two-cup glass measuring cup to save on cleanup.    This recipe couldn't be simpler.  Thanks, Francesca!
