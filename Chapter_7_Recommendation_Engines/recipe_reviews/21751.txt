I used this recipe for the topping of an 8x8 pan of bread pudding.  I used only 1 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of corstarch to amke it thicker.  In the end it came out great!

Perfect over recipe for Bread Pudding II submitted by Ellen Warfield! I took the advice of another review and changed it to two TBSP cornstarch to 1 cup water. Served warm.  It was the perfect consistency!

Good start, but needs work.  Definitely reduce the water to 1 cup and add another tablespoon cornstarch.  Very good with these changes!

Why are people giving this 4 stars and then saying the quantities are all wrong and you should use powdered sugar? That's like giving a 4 star review to your cruise on the titanic. "Everything was just lovely, marred oh so slightly by that incident with the iceberg". This recipe is just plain wrong and if you make it you'll end up with a pan of water. If you change it as others suggest, it will be better, but still didn't have enough flavor or richness. Abandon ship and look elsewhere for your vanilla sauce advice.

I'm glad I read the review before attempting this recipe. I did like the others and used 1 cup of water and 2 tbsp. of cornstarch.  It came out pretty good.  I used it over Bread Pudding II from this site.  I might try adding a little whiskey to this to see what happens to the flavor next time.......

I also got a very watery syrup that would not thicken up, but I think the problem is that the submitter put in her recipe to use white sugar meaning confectioner sugar not regular granulated sugar, though when a normal recipe calls for white sugar it is usually means regular sugar so thats what I used. I figured I would try it again with the powdered sugar and see if that comes out better.

I made the changes suggested by other reviewers: used half the water, twice the cornstarch, confectioner's sugar.  I also added half a cup of evaporated milk when I added the butter and vanilla.  Not only very good on the bread pudding I made it for, but good cold the next day with store-bought molasses cookies.

i was looking for a quick and easy vanilla sauce to go with a jewish apple cake i made, and this was quick, easy, and delicious!  its a little more carmel than vanilla, but carmel and apple go well together.  i did reduce the water to 1 cup and increase the cornstarch to 2 tablespoons and it turned out perfectly.  this would also be fabulous with bread pudding.

Without reading other reviews, I followed the recipe to a T, and I have to say that as written it is a watered-down goopy mess of a sauce. The term "white sugar" is extremely vague and I took it to mean granulated sugar (having never made this exact type of sauce before, how was I to know?). I had to dump the sauce down the drain and start from scratch. Second time around I used powdered sugar, and I replaced the 2 cups of water with only 1 cup of milk. Basically I had to follow an entirely different recipe, and it came out great.

Very good. I followed the recipe as is and used it over bread pudding. It was nice because it warmed and softened the bread a bit. Next time will follow the suggestions to decrease water and increase cornstarch.

Sorry, no stars. I used all the good advice of the other reviewers, reduced water to 1 can, used 2 tablespoons starch and powdered sugar. I have a guest with a lactose allergy, that's why I was looking for a recipe without milk or cream. The product was alright in consistency but it tasted terrible. Like mashed card board with vanilla flavour. Hugh! I hate throwing food out but I couldnâ€™t think of any thing to do it with. So I fed it to the cats - there are 20 barn cats, they eat everything ;-)
Sorry, it might be a useful sauce for something, but I wouldn't dare calling it "Vanilla sauce".

Great easy recipe for vanilla sauce. If you want the thicker sauce follow other remarks about adding 2 T of cornstarch to 1 c of water.

I followed several reviewers' suggestions to reduce the water to 1 cup and increase the cornstarch to 2 Tbs. I used granulated sugar. (White sugar always refers to granulated, not powdered sugar. Maybe some reviewers had trouble because they didn't blend the sugar and cornstarch completely before adding the water, or they didn't stir while it was getting hot. That would cause lumps for sure.) The consistency was perfect to go on top of Pumpkin Bread Pudding found on this site. The pudding was great and this sauce made it even better.   I'm rating this 5 stars because I hate to see someone give a bad rating when the cook changed the recipe. I'm sure this is just as good as written, just a little thinner.

Based on other reviews, I increased the cornstarch to 2 TBSP and used 1 1/2 cups liquid (subbed milk for water).  Served with bread pudding.  We thought it was very good.

I took the other reviewer's suggestions and cut the water to 1 Cup and bumped up the cornstarch to 2 Tablespoons.  I thought this was very good.  I used it over a dense, moist cinnamon cake (much like bread pudding) with vanilla ice cream and it was amazing!!  I can't think what else I would use it on, but it was exactly what I needed at the time!

If you substituted margarine for butter and advertised it as lactose-free, it might be acceptable, but I had this alongside a vanilla sauce made with milk and I was truly humiliated by the poor taste and texture of this sauce. I will certainly never make this again.

My dad always made this sauce for bread pudding when I was a kid.  I couldn't find the recipe he gave me anywhere.  After searching the net for quite a while and only finding recipes that called for cream, I stumbled upon this one.  It's pretty much identical to the one I had.  I too halved the recipe and upped the cornstarch to 2tsp.  PERFECT, just the finishing touch that bread pudding needs!

I followed the mods that most people mentioned, increasing to 2 T cornstarch and decreasing to 1 C water. We liked it, but I did find it a bit sweet. I will make it again, but may try it with more water to cut the sweetness. I might also try switching the vanilla extract with rum flavoring. It reminded me of butter rum sauce.

Simple and good on bread pudding.  I followed the advice of others and increased corn starch to 2 T and decreased water to 1 cup.  Also, I am diabetic so I used spenda instead of sugar and no one could tell the difference.  (I make this substitution alot)

Hmmm, I didn't like how watery it tasted. I always like my sauces creamy, especially with bread pudding. Not as terrific as I hoped, unfortunately. Next time I'll stick with traditional creme anglaise- something not based on water.

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, did the 2 tbls of cornstarch and did 1/2 cup carnation milk with 1/2 cup water. It was soooooo yummy, a keeper. Thanks for the recipe and all the other sugestions.

Good, but now I realize why pure vanilla extract should be used! I used imitation and I could taste the fake vanilla flavor. I made it thicker and used less sugar and it came out fine!

This seemed to be really runny no matter how much corn starch you added. I will stick to the Carmel sauce.

This really did not turn out well at all.  I tried using confectioners sugar and less water, but still no luck.  It was very watery and much too thin to use as any kind of sauce.  Sorry, but I'll keep looking.

It's funny reading the other reviews about variations, adding & taking away. I followed the recipe with WHITE SUGAR & it turned out AMAZING. I made it only because I didn't have CONFECTIONERS sugar for vanilla icing for my home made vanilla cake. My daughter & I were delighted! I've made it twice.. Again yesterday. If you don't care for a runny sauce all you have to do is add more cornstarch. Now, I did add more butter lol. I was in the mood for something peanut buttery earlier, so I added a tablespoon of pb in a 1/2 cup of the sauce. OMG! Yummy!!! Thanks so much.

This recipe needs to be changed before it gets anything above 1 star.  As written, the recipe comes out very watery and soupy, with no real flavor.

I made this sauce for Healthier Bread Pudding. I cut back on the water by half and doubled the cornstarch. I also used Splenda in place of sugar. It turn out like a sauce consistency and it tasted pretty tasty. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Tasty! Only sub was milk for water and a little extra cornstarch. A lot easier than messing with sauces that have eggs and tempering.

This is the recipe my mother used for over 60 years.  I made it as written and got a perfect result. Key points are to mix sugar and cornstarch before adding water, and to heat (med-high) stirring CONSTANTLY. Let it cool to warm after adding vanilla and butter. Perfect over chocolate cake.

I changed the recipe a bit.  I only used one cup water and two tablespoons cornstarch because I wanted it to be a bit thicker to use on bread pudding.  It works really well.  The last time I made it I accidently used two tablespoons instead of two teaspoons of vanilla.  My mom said she likes it even better that way.  More vanilla flavour and she didn't find it as sweet that way.

I halved the recipe and used approximate measurements and it still turned out similar to what I think it would, had I followed and measured exactly. I added a bit more vanilla than called for and served it warm over bread pudding III from this site. I was looking for something a bit more vanilla-y...this did the trick as far as adding moisture, but was more of a glorified simple syrup sauce than a rich, vanilla sauce that I was hoping for.

Oh boy, is this ever good!  I doubled the cornstarch and halved the water and used confectionersâ€™ sugar.  This will give more than enough sauce with a thick consistency to be used on Bread Pudding II from this site.

I did not care for this sauce--I was expecting soemthing thicker and creamier.  If you are looking for a very sweet watery sauce, this is the one.  If not, keep looking.

I really liked this.  I changed it by using 1 1/2 cups water (but could have gone down to 1) and 2 Tbsp of cornstarch.  Thickened up nicely and tasted pretty good on bread pudding.

The sauce is really sweet and really runny but it's actually works really well since my bread pudding is really dry.  If you're  using the  sauce as a topping I would suggest adjusting the cornstarch a little bit.

I made this using the instructions on the recipe and the advice of several reviewers reducing the water and adding more cornstarch. Thanks to the reviewers tips, the consistency came out perfect. But I'm sorry to say that I did not find this to taste good at all. The flavour did not seem to "combine" smoothly. To me, it seemed like I made vanilla flavoured water. Perhaps I did something wrong.

Used it with Bread Pudding II. Doubled the cornstarch and cut the water by half. Delicious!

This is thin, the color is off, and it's not so flavorful.

Author used incorrect ingredients. She should have said 10x sugar (powdered sugar) if you follow directions then you will have dirty, syrupy, water colored mixture. Nasty and a waste of ingedients.

The idea of the sauce seemed okay, but as others I had to modify the whole recipe. I used 3/4 cup icing sugar, 2 TBSP of cornstarch, 1 cup of water. After it came to a boil I added the butter and extract (I used maple~personal preference) I tasted it and though it was still lacking something. I added about 1/4 cup of half and half cream to the mixture and that creamed it up and it tasted good. Hard to give more then 1 star when the whole recipe was changed. Sorry.

This is the same recipe that my grandma made for years.  This is the only thing to eat on gingerbread.  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and my grandma always added a pinch of salt.  I could not rate 5 stars because of the adjustments but this is awesome!

Made bread pudding last night. Wanted to serve with a vanilla sauce and found this one. So easy and delicious. I even used  real margarine (not spread) instead of butter and still wonderful. Next time I'll try butter.

I made this for my Butterscotch Bread Pudding I made for supper, it was terrific.  My family loved it.  I also did what other viewers said, I used 1 cup of water instead of 2, and 2 tablespoons of Corn Starch, Plus I doubled the recipe, and lots left for tomorrow.. Thank you for the wonderful recipe, I certainly would use it again, and again.

i also used this on top of bread pudding II. i did not have cornstarch on hand so just used flour instead i mixed one cup of sugar to one cup of water and put that on the stove on high. then i mixed 2 tbs of flour with 1/4 c of water in a bowl till well mixed and dumped it in the sugar water mix. after it boiled and cooked for a minute, i took it off the heat and added 2 tbs butter. (make sure you use real butter because it tastes much better!!!) then i dumped it on my still warm out of the oven bread pudding... delicious!

This is a pretty good sauce recipe :) As per the reviews I doubled the cornstarch, but I found it still pretty runny - so next time I will add more again. I also doubled the vanilla so the flavour would pop and it was yummy! I'd make it again :)

This is a fabulous recipe. I do make it with brown sugar though, instead of white.  It is great over fresh apple cake. It has been in my family  for years. My Mom always made it with the white sugar but I prefer the brown. Good either way

Yikes!  I did NOT (as I usually do) read the reviews first and this turned out to be a runny mess.  It tasted ok, but it was NOT how a vanilla sauce should be.  Follow the advice of the other reviewers.  I used milk (half of what's called for) and confectioners sugar for second batch, I also doubled the cornstarch and it was much much better!  Will make it again with the Grandma's apple bread pudding which was amazing.

I found this recipe to be a watery sweet conglomeration.  I expected a creamy vanilla sauce that was not overly sweet.  Great if you need sugar water.  Rather disappointed.

This is a great sauce.  I am sure you can make different flavors, ex. Lemon.  I am going to try that.
