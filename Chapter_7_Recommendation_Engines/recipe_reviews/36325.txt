Wow, these were the best fajitas I've ever made! I definitely recommend using flank steak as it turns out SO tender. I marinated mine for about 30 mins, then seared it on the BBQ over high heat. I only cooked it a few mins per side, so that the meat was still pinkish-red inside. I also grilled the veggies on the BBQ. YUM! This had such an authentic taste to it. I probably wouldn't have liked it as much cooked on the stove though. I think BBQing everything makes all the difference. I'm going to make these again in a few days. My fiance came home from a business trip and had the leftovers today and he LOVED it. The lime adds a nice touch too.

This is an excellent recipe. It has a real authentic Mexican flavor. Try using both red & green peppers together.The results are outstanding.

I thought this was 'alright'. ~Marinated 4 hours ~  I used Flank Steak, and will NOT use that again!  If I make this recipe, I'll try it on chicken, or sirloin, or some other type of steak.  I used extra lime and added yellow/red peppers also.  I think my main problem was the steak...

Both husband and I enjoyed this recipe!  The second time I made thise, I added the juice of 1 lemon, 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of chili powder just to give it an extra kick - it did the trick!  I usually just dump everything in a saute pan because it's faster and the marinade makes a great sauce. Great both in whole wheat tortillas and over brown rice.

We enjoyed.  Since I was not grilling, I just dumped the marinade, meat & vegetables in a skillet and cooked.  We added mexican beans to our tortillas also.  I am rating a 4 but felt that it still needed something so I added fajita mix with 1 tbsp. of water and that gave it the kick I wanted.  We thought it was then a 5.  Thanks

I made these with chicken instead of steak and added extra lime juice to the marinade.  A little spicier than I would have imagined for fajitas, but that's not a bad thing.  It was very tasty and the meat was tender.

YUM!  I took one of the earlier suggestions and used fajita seasoning instead of the McCormick southwest seasoning as I wasn't sure I'd like it.  Otherwise left it unchanged, and did both flank steak and chicken breasts.  Steak was good, but chicken was fabulous!  Marinated both for about 24 hours but the chicken seemed to soak up the marinade flavor much better even after piercing the steak as directed.  Cooked the meats on my George Foreman grill and did the veggies in a grill pan on the stovetop.  Excellent meal well received by guests also.  Will definitely be making this again!!

This made some tender flank steak fajitas!  Marinated 48 hours.  We both added sour cream and salsa.  My husband loaded his with cheese.  If I'd had another fresh lime I would have squirted it on my serving.  Grilled 1" steak 8min/side on high.

For this recipe I used thinly sliced leftover london broil and a leftover pork chop for my daughter who doesn't eat steak. The seasonings were delicious. I even added a splash of beer to the skillet while the meat was cooking. Gave it a great flavor. Fantastic dish!

I'll use a different recipe for fajitas next time.

These are great!  I sometimes have a hard time finding the Marinade, but when I do I buy more than one, because they are just that good.

THESE WERE GOOD. I MARINATED THEM OVERNIGHT AND INSTEAD OF GRILLING OR BROILING I SIMMERED THEM ON THE STOVE IN THE MARINADE. SERVED WITH MEXICAN RICE FROM THIS WEBSITE.

These were good-even the husband thought so. I used chicken strips rather then steak-still tasted great. Also used the seasoning as a rub rather then a marinade. I just drizzled olive oil on the chicken-did the same with the veggies-yummy!

Super easy & tasty recipe for fajitas!
I made exactly accdg to recipe & didn't give 5 stars only b/c I thought the marinade mix kind of overpowered everything...next time, I'll either add more veggies/meat to this recipe or only use 1/2 the packet. Yum, thank you!

My husband and I both LOVED this recipe.  I used it to marinade chicken and portabella mushrooms and it was fantastic with both.  I also grilled peppers and vidalia onions and served on grilled tortillas.  My husband wants it on the menu at least once a week!

My husband particularly liked this; said it was a 4.5; I think 4stars. :-) My dear little town's two grocery stores couldn't come up with any McCormick's SW seasoning (grrr!), so I had to resort to Emeril's.  I'll still be hunting that stuff down though.  Made everything else as written; served with a Mexican cheese mix, sour cream, and Garden Tomato Salsa (from this website).  Very tasty dinner!

Awesome recipe.  It's my husband's favorite.  I marinated some shrimp (in a separate baggie) along with the beef.  

I served this with the 5 star tortilla soup and it was a huge hit.

Wow! These were amazing!!! Me and my family wolfed them down, and before we knew it, they were all gone! I put some fresh cilantro into the marinade, and I think that is what really gave those flavors and extra kick! I also added some shallots, and used chicken breats instead of steak. The recipe worked well with the salsa, cheese, and sour cream! Will definatly make again and again!!!

We loved this marinade!  I couldn't find McCormick seasoning, so I used Durkee instead.  We also preferred chicken breast to steak, and prepared it on the grill.

These were good and everyone liked them. I thought they had a bit of a "prepared" taste from the marinade, but overall very popular and easy to make.

Absolutely great, and I'm not a big beef fan! I couldn't find the McCormick Southwest Marinade, so I substituted Kroger's. Will definitely make again.

I have made this with regular fajita seasoning and the southwest marinade seasoning and definitely prefer regular fajita seasonings.  The southwest marinade mix made it way too spicey.  

Everyone raves when I make these fajitas.

My husband raved about this- even the kids were asking for seconds! I added sliced red pepper which works well too. A definate keeper- will try it with chicken next time.

I used this recipe with chicken, boneless breasts I cut into strips.  I also used more onions and peppers, at least double the amount.  It came out very good.

I really like the marinade used with these fajitas! The only thing I changed was, I added a orange and red pepper! I love the contrast in peppers with such a BOLD marinade it needed more than a boring green pepper!

Excellent flavor!  I've made these fajitas 4 years running now for an annual group camping trip for up to 40 people.  After the first year there was now doubt they'd become a tradition.  I prep the meat and marinade ahead of time, vacuum pack and allow to marinate for 24 hours prior to freezing.  My only changes are to use 2 lbs of steak (usually petite sirloin) and add a sliced poblano pepper to the mix.  

Thaw, toss in the veggies and POOF! fajitas for a crowd.  They go great with beer, good friends, and open sky.

These were great! I also used a fajita seasoning instead of the southwest, added more lime juice and grilled the flank steak 7 minutes on each side. The beef was still a little pink in the middle, which is the way my family likes it. We made margaritas and ate key lime pie for dessert! It was lovely!

This was ok, might make it again. I thought the seasoning was a bit strong but then again that might of been an error on my part because I scaled the recipe down to 2.

Hmm, I was expecting something more authentic.  This was pretty heavy on the cumin, not what you usually get in authentic Mexican recipes, Tex-Mex, or in the homes of Mexican cooks.  But I'm spoiled, I live in Dallas.  It was tasty, just not the taste I was hoping for.  Thanks anyway.

I used lemon juice and olive oil and a mixture of grill mates spices and Emeril's Essence.  Extra onions and peppers.  It was a hit... will definitely make it again.

so far this is the best fajita recipe around. i couldn't locate the grillmates marinade anywhere so ended up trying "world harbor's crock & cook sauce" in the southwestern citrus flavor. one cup of this sauce with half the recommended lime juice seemed to work pretty well. i marinated the flank steak for 6 hours & without the veggies because we chose to grill them separately. the meat came out delicious & wonderfully tender. thanks mc cormick's (sorry i couldn't find your product).
