These are delicious cookies!  I did take the advice of other reviewers and I added about 1/8 cup of flour (I used a little less than 1/4 cup total).  I also used dried cherries because I didn't have apricots and I loved how they turned out.

I like the flavor combination of chocolate chips and apricots, but I followed the recipe EXACTLY and I wound up with a flat, spread out cookie. Oven was preheated.  Probably would add 1/2 cup more flour or some rolled oats to prevent this problem.

This recipe was really very yummy and an interesting combination of flavors. I used a lesser amount of dark chocolate chunks and it worked very well - any more and it would have definitely been too sweet for me.

Made these cookies sat Aug14, to celebrate my sister's birthday, they came out very good, I love them chewy and the taste of apricot mixed with the chocolate, splendid. This recipe is a keeper. I made no changes other than cutting back on the sugar. Cutting it back by a few tablespoons each sugar.

I baked for Christmas gifts along with an assortment of other cookies.  I wanted a chocolate chip cookie but not the traditional kind.  This was a good twist.  I loved the chewiness/tartness of the apricots in with the crunchiness of the cookie.

I'm a soon to be culinary student. I made these as an experiment. I'm starting with simple ingrediant lists and advancing with every success onto another type of recipe.  I found this one to be runny, the cookies were gooey and spread out too much without any advance warning that they would be a very chewy gooey type cookie.  I thought the sugar content too high with chocolate and apricot (both of which need little assistance to stand out and which are competitive in flavor and do not need a third overpowering flavor added.) I would make a slighty stronger batter with more of a shortbread in the future as that would have a better complement for chocolate and apricot.  Otherwise, it was o.k. but not an all star cookie.

I'm giving these a 5 because the flavor and idea was so good, but my experimentation wasn't. The recipe sounded so good that I had to make them, but I didn't have any dried apricots, only apricot jam. I substituted 1/4 cup of the white sugar for splenda, and added 1/2 cup apricot jam in place of the apricots. The result was a super sweet cookie with amazing taste that was too runny. I WILL make them again, and if I don't have dried apricots I will leave out the white sugar as the jam is sweet enough, and add a little more flour. I also froze part of the dough, but haven't cooked them yet to see if there is any difference. WOW! Apricots in chocolate chip cookies, what a great idea!

This was good and an interesting combination but will not be my "stand by" chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I made this the same afternoon as the chocolate chip cookie V recipe.  We did a family taste test and the choc chip V's were the unanimous winner.  I will try that recipe with the dried apricots next time.

Quite yummy!  I skipped the chips and added extra flour (1/8 cup), as one of the reviewers suggested.  This def helped keep the cookies cohesive.    Be aware that the recipe does not make a whole lot of cookies.

really a good cookie. I tried with milk choc, but I guess white chocolate would be great too. and they store well, too, if you manage to have some left to store, that is.

Fantastic cookie! Some of the best I've ever made. I love the combination of dried apricots and chocolate. I didn't need to use as many chips - would've dominated the cookie - but didn't effect their taste or popularity. The batch didn't last long in my house.

Pretty good cookies.  I'd prefer more apricot and less chocolate chips, but I tend to like fruit more than chocolate anyway.  Bf was excited I made cookies and went straight for them.  He was gobbling them up, so they must be a success!  Very soft, chewy and flat cookies, which I like.   Thanks for the recipe!

Some reviewers mentioned adding more flour. I used 1 1/2 cups of flour.  By doing that, it is basically the same recipe as, 'Best Chocolate Chip Cookies' from this site, which I have made and really liked. I also lowered the oven temp to 350degF (same as the other recipe). I made these into just over a tsp size, and I got about 48 cookies. Need to watch time; my second batch at 10 min was more brown. I'd say 8-9 min would be good. I love the chopped apricot, as a change from cranberries or nuts. Excellent cookie! I plan to gift some, so the recipe as written  (no need to change serving size) makes enough for that and some for myself, without a lot leftover that may tempt me! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious combination! I will definately make these again.  I did substitute Unbleached White Whole Wheat Flour for the All Purpose Flour and it worked great!

Unique and tastey combination! I followed past reviews and reduced the amount of chocolate chips to about 1/3, and tried adding some raisins, very delicious! Thanks, will make again

A good recipe.  I completely changed it though!  Used Flax Flour, Whole Wheat and Unbleached Flour.  Used Sucanat and cut down on brown sugar.  I beat the mixture after I added eggs until it was fluffy.  Instead of dried apricots, I used fresh, ripe, chopped apricots.

This is a tasty recipe but it definitely needs some tweaking. I added the extra 1/8 cup of flour as suggested by other reviewers but I really don't think it was required as the batter was a bit too firm and the cookies didn't spread at all while baking. Also, I didn't have any turbinado sugar so I opted to use only the 1/2 cup of brown sugar. The cookies were sweet enough with using only half the amount of sugar called for and I think would have been far too sweet using the full cup. Also, this recipe doesn't make very many cookies - I got less than 2 1/2 dozen, so beware if you're looking for a larger batch.

This cookie was delicious!!  The combination of the dried apricot and chocolate chip is so unique!!  I did use less of the chocolate chip (only half of a cup, Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chip)and Mariana Brand for the dried apricot (also only half of a cup).  I cut the dried apricot into very small cubes.  This dried apricot was delicious, it was moist, flavorful, and fresh tasting.  The cookie was chewy and soft with a nice crisp at the edge.  My family loved the cookies.  This recipe is a keeper.
