I very carefully weighed out 4 pounds of rhubarb and got 12 culs! I was pretty sure this was way too much fruit so I divided it in half, doubled the batter and made 2 cakes. Maybe after all the effort (I had spent much of the day running from friend to friend scrounging fruit) I couldn't help but be let down. Cake was fine but nothing I will likely make again. I hope someone else measures out 4 pounds and lets me know how much they get.

This will turn out good if you double the rhubarb to 8 cups and the custard is fine as it is, but the crust was way too sweet. It was good when we added just 1/4 cup or even 3 TBS of sugar to the crust and it was like a fine butter crust pastry rather than a super sweet cookie. The custard was good though, perfect. Just needed more rhubarb. We doubled the rhubarb and it was good. Pre cook the crust super lightly. Really delicate when not so sweet.

We LOVE rhubarb so I'm always looking for new recipes.  This one far exceeded my expectations.  My husband says it's company worthy!  Add a little whipped cream or ice cream and it's even better.  Yum!

VERY GOOD 
added 1 tsp real vanilla and 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
it says 4 cups which is perfect for this NOT 4 pounds as gogogadget stated as "to much" 4# would be way to much .

This dessert was so bad that I am writing my first review ever.  First, you can tell from the photo that there is way more than the 4 cups rhubarb listed .  I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted like sweetened flour with a little bit of fruit and custard in the middle.  I served it to friends and neighbors and no one said a word, which tells you how kind my friends are but how awful the dessert was.

Fabulous!  A friend from Alaska gave me several packages of frozen rhubarb...this will definitely be my go-to rhubarb dessert.  Everyone who tried it raved.

Very good. Cut the sugar in the custard by 1/2 cup because I know I love the tart tang of rhubard. Added 1/2 blueberries for more color.  Took to father's day, mine went quick.

I cut the recipe in half and cut back slightly on the sugar. My husband, sister and I enjoyed it tremendously. 
I froze a few bars and they thawed nicely.
I will definitely make this recipe again!

This was great! I was out of butter and used coconut oil and it was still great. The custard was fabulous! The sweetness of the crust and custard were perfect with the tart rhubarb.

This is very nice, not tart to my taste.  I added a tsp of cinnamon to topping, and a bit of vanilla to filling.   Because I do like a bit of tartness, may add another cup of rhubarb next time.  I especially like that  there is a base layer.   Recommend using a glass baking dish if possible.  Thanks for sharing, Debbie.

I loved this recipe.  It was easy to follow and by far one of the best cobblers I have ever made.  Will be making it again when I rhubarb plant produced more stems.

I love this recipe! Instead of using half and half I used heavy whipping cream and it still turned out fantastic! This is definitely a must try!

I have to agree Debbie. This is an excellent recipe. It's quick and the rhubarb dessert is perfect, though I cut back a little on the white sugar...so easy to put together..

My family loves rhubarb, so I always add 1/2 cup or so more than a recipe calls for. I will definitely make it again.

I agree one of the best rhubarb dessert recipes.   I probably would cut down some of the sugar and add a little more butter to the crust.  It seemed dry after mixing but tasted great.

I think this would've been better w/out the bottom crust. It wasn't bad, just not fabulous.
