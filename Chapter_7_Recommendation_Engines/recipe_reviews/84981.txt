This recipe was a total hit with my family gathering last week. I think what you need to keep in mind is the recipe doesn't claim to be "authentic", it's very simple, yet the flavor is definitely NOT your ordinary potato 
salad.  I'm making this again this afternoon for a burger and sausage bbq and I can assure you, they'll be no leftovers.  Thanks for sharing!

While I am not sure I would call this a "German" potato salad, we liked it.  I didn't fry bacon, just used the pre-packaged stuff, so I didn't have any bacon grease.  I also left out the eggs.  Next time I will probably add more olives because I REALLy like what they added to the dish.  Thanks for a different potato salad recipe.  I will make again.

Love this recipe!  I make it for parties, BBQ's, a side dish to bring to the neighbors house...you name it.  People always ask me for the recipe.  I'm starting to feel a little protective of it...like a hidden jewel.  Sometimes I forget to reserve the bacon grease.  Sometimes I add an extra boiled egg.  Makes no difference.  I've never liked potato salad but this one I can just sit with a bowl and a spoon.  Yum!

i was pretty happy with this dish. however, i had to make some adjustments for my family. my kids dont like a lot of onion, so i reduced that by half. same with the eggs. it went over pretty well with the family... it had some what of an after taste though. i dont know if thats because of the italian seasonings or what. maybe it was just my taste buds! :] might make again...

I cut this recipe in half, used organic red potatoes, used half a package of turkey bacon, a mixture of fat free plain yogurt and fat free sour cream, omitted the green olives because I didn't have any and used half a recipe of Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix. After I had my older boy taste it, he said "it needs pickles, Mom", so I added a couple chopped large garlic dills. Even cutting it down, my three boys inhaled it. No leftovers. I had one bite and I thought it was pretty tasty, even lowfat. My husband even asked me "Are you SURE it's lowfat". LAWLZ, that was a riot. See, good food can be lowfat and not kill you. ;)

A really delicious dish. I used  only 1 cup of light sour cream and just a tablespoon of the bacon drippings and it was plenty of rich dressing.

I made this the night before I served it.  Everyone raved about it.  It was so different from the regular old potato salad. Reminded me of one I had years ago that was made with dill pickles and have tried to duplicate with no success  Thanks for a very good recipe.

We liked this! The only thing I think, is next time I will use more mayo and less sour cream. I am a fan of both, but I felt the sour cream gave it more of a 'flat' flavor. On the upside, we loved the addition of the green olives and bacon is ALWAYS a winner in our house, lol. I did also need to add salt, but that's our preference. I would make this again, but with my changes! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a very simple recipe to follow.  First time making potatoe salad and it turned out delicious.  My husband absolutely loved it.  To make it less fattening I used FF Sour Cream and Miracle Whip and lower sodium bacon and ranch dressing.  He didn't know the difference.  Recommend it.

This is a pretty good salad.  Unfortunately I missed the part about reserving the bacon grease and had disposed of it.  I also added some fresh dill, salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Thank you Rhonda!

I got lots of compliments on this recipe!  I felt like it lost some of the flavor after it sat overnight though so I would suggest making and serving same day.

Hailing from central Texas, being of German descent, I will say this is it! EXCEPT for one small detail. Olives? I use Clausen whole dill pickles (brand specific) shredded like you would cheese, and all juices accumulated from shredding.  Also, use real bacon, and the drippings from cooking it.  I have had professional BBQ  chefs beg me for this.  It is amazing!

This salad was delicious.  I used black olives instead of green olives.  Not everyone likes green olives.  I really wouldn't call this German Potato Salad.  More like Potato and Bacon Salad.  I used light sour cream and not to much bacon drippings.  My husband really loved it.
