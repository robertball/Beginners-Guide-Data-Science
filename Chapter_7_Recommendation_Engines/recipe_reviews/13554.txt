I have looked high and low...experimenting with various gingerbread recipes, and finally I have found this one! It is wonderful! The taste is superb and so is the moist texture. It might look like a lot of work, but it's not, and any work is WELL worth it!!

Very nice!  I made this as a cake for a cake walk fundraiser we are having next week, so I made in an angel food bundt pan.  I also don't have fresh ginger so I just used two teaspoons of ground ginger total.  I don't remember if crystalized ginger and candied ginger are the same (I think not, but like I said I can't remember) but I have candied, so I used that.  I didn't have enough molasses, but I used the amount I had (at little over 1/2 c I think).  I set a little bit of the batter aside and made a cupcake so I could try.  So good! I really like this gingerbread taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was really good!  I loved using three types of ginger.  I had a golden delicious apple on hand and so I diced half of it and added it in.  It was a pleasure to make and to eat.  Thank you for sharing this recipe; I intend to bake it again.

Smells much better than it tastes. If I were to ever use this recipe again as a base, I would add some vanilla and substitute raisins for the crystalized ginger. I might even cut the molasses with some honey...

This is an awesome recipe!!  Very gingery and not too heavy. BUT, mine sank in the middle??! I Googled the problem and the answer was probably too much baking soda.  I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happen?  It does call for 2 teaspoons which did seem high, and I'm pretty sure I measured correctly.  I'm going to try it again and cut it to 1 teaspoon.  Also recommended on Google was to be sure to use a pre-heated oven which I did.  Any comments
