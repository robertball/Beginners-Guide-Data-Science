Made them tonight with a few changes and we really liked them. Must say collards aren't our favorite, but hubby said this recipe is definitely a keeper.  My changes--an extra slice of bacon, white onion instead of red (didn't have any red), 1 bunch of collards (didn't measure it in cups), chicken broth instead of water, no red pepper flakes, and pintos instead of cannellini beans. Some of the changes had more effect than others, I'm sure. I used what I had.  Oh, and one other thing--while the greens were simmering, I tossed some raw sweet italian sausages in to cook on top.  Served with very basic biscuits--the biscuits were yummy with the pot liquor.  Anyway, given that we're not working with our favorite ingredient, and the recipe was still yummy even with all the things I had to do to fit what I had, I rate this five stars. Very good.

I really liked this but I added sweet potato pieces which I think made the dish. I also didn't cook it as long, and I thought it was delicious.

I love this recipe! I'm from the South and I'm a little picky about my collard greens, and this recipe is wonderful! There are so many tasty flavors involved. I sometimes add chicken sausage to this when it's done and eat it as a whole meal.

the first time i made this i followed the recipe exactly and it was ok.  it was my first time with collard greens and i wasn't sure what to expect.  the next time i made it i used chicken stock instead of water and after i cooked the bacon i left it out until the end to sprinkle over the finished collard greens.  i like the texture of bacon to be nice and crispy, it seemed soggy to me when i did it following the recipe.  my boyfriend and i enjoyed it both times, but the second time was much better for us.  i served it over brown rice.

I am not a fan of collard greens but had bought some for a recipe. I found this and will have to say it was fantastic. I substituted red onion for sweet onion and chicken stock for the water. Rave reviews and I will definately make again. The original recipe that I used for this, (from cuisine magazine) was horrible. Thanks for sharing Melanie.

A good solid recipe.  I think I will try using lemon instead of apple vinegar next time as for me it was a bit strong.  Also, I'll make sure to use beans that don't taste too "tough".  Not the recipe's fault, just my can of beans.  The flavor was great.

this is very good the only change I made was instead of adding plain water, I boiled some smoked pork neck bones until the meat fell off the bone and used the broth and meat to give it a wonderful rich hearty flavor.

This is one of, if not the, best collard green dishes I have ever had. My boyfriend said the same thing. I followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent!  Works with any kind of greens.  I used Kale and only needed to simmer about 30 min. to wilt the leaves.

This is a meal all by itself. Wow, I'm glad I didn't throw that chicken in the oven to have with this. This is so filling and delicious, It was not necessary. I followed the recipe using chicken broth for the water, and dried great northern beans instead of canned (of coarse I soaked and cooked them first) and it was perfect.

Good grief, that's good.  I used slightly more bacon and vinegar than the recipe calls for, and I subbed chicken broth for the water.  I also cooked the collards for about 2 1/2 hours.  WOW.

Better than expected!  I added an extra can of beans and some chopped ham to make it a meal.  It did turn out really salty, so I would recommend not adding any salt until you can taste it at the end (I added about 1/4 tsp during cooking).  If you can find low-sodium bacon, go with that.

I've made this recipe twice, and both times my partner and I really enjoyed it. I start with whole bacon b/c they're easier to remove and then crumble them up later. Also, the first time I tried this I had more than 5 cups of collards, which I preferred (I'm a veggie lover). The second time I used closer to 5 cups (eye-balled), and after it cooked down, I  wished there were more greens. Also, with the bacon, I don't think adding more salt is necessary. Overall, it's a great recipe that I think is fairly flexible in terms of quantity, type of bean used, etc.

My husband was so bummed there wasn't more of this.  I used more bacon (at least six rashers) regular onion too since we didn't have red, and chicken stock, and we only simmered about 45 minutes to an hour.  Next time I'll make two or three bunches of collards and triple everything else.  Really good light main meal with the extra luxury of bacon!

I made this tonight and got an "A+" from my 6-year-old.  My husband said, "I was expecting it to be great, and it was even better than I was expecting!"  I loved it, too.  I made it with a few changes: 1) already-cooked bacon leftover from breakfast; fortunately, I had saved some of the bacon fat so I could saute the onions in it
2) I used collard greens and kale (fresh from our garden :)
3) I used a can of black beans, since I didn't have any cannellini and didn't have time to cook my dried kidney beans.  The black beans still had a great flavor with this combination.  Yummy!  My biggest problem: not enough for leftovers!  Next time I will make a double batch.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was my first time with collards (or any time of greens!), and I liked it.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I hate bacon, so I used vegetable oil to saute in and bullion in the water to replace the salt.  Probably a heresy to anyone who actually knows southern cooking, but I liked it.

This is delish.  I used chickpeas since that is all I have.  I did not use the bacon and sub it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil instead.  Very good and very different.

Really fast and easy. I will use a pork hock or some piece of pork in addition to the bacon plus add some tomatoes and a green pepper for more taste and color the next time I make this.

YUMMY, YUMMY! Made this for the first time 2 weeks ago and had to have again. Family and friends couldn't get enough. The only change I made was I used Chicken Broth (low sodium) instead of water. This is definitely a 5 STAR!!

My husband often sees Collard or Mustard greens on cooking shows.  Since we both love cooked spinach and swiss chard, we have been curious to try collard greens.  Unfortunately in Montana, I never saw fresh collard greens until today.  I couldn't wait to get home and try this dish. We absolutely love this dish.  The only thing I changed from this recipe was to use chicken broth instead of water, after reading other reviews.  We will be having this dish often and will try with other greens when we can find them.  My husband has already requested them for supper later this week and he put collared greens on the shopping list.

Excellent!  I've never had Southern greens despite having lived in the south for a while.  I used a large bunch of yellow stemmed collard greens and a handful of purple frilly looking mustard greens.  (They looked so good at the Farmer's Market!)  I followed all the directions except adding the liquid and the vinegar.  Oh and the beans.  When the greens etc were fully wilted it looked and tasted so good that I couldn't see cooking for another 2 hours in liquid.  I did add the brown sugar and then served it with balsamic vinegar for sprinkling on top.  It was so good I forgot to try the sour cream!  I will, some day, try them the traditional way using this recipe, but it was great the way it was!   : )

This was awesome.  I actually made this vegetarian by skipping the bacon completely.  I ended up doubling the water and the amount of cider vinegar in order to cover my greens.  I didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I used a teaspoon of cajun seasoning instead.  I simmered it for about an hour.  The flavor was amazing even without the bacon!  No leftovers at all...

These are by far the best collard greens I've ever eaten.  Recently I had a hankering for collard greens and went down to the Whole Foods deli.  Theirs were disgusting.  I had to throw them out.  Bad collard greens exist out there.  But these blow me away every time I make them.  I got my picky family turned on to them, and my new housemate, says to me, "Those are collard greens?  How do you get them to smell so good?"  Yes, they are that good.  Kind of like a cross of collards with baked beans.  I LOVE this recipe.

This was excellent.  I didn't have the bacon or the beans, but we had leftover Easter ham and I just sauteed that up in a little olive oil, then followed the rest of the recipe.  yum.

This was delicious!  I had to use a yellow onion instead of a red one, since it was all I had.  I also used Great Northern Beans instead of cannellini.  Will need to tone down the spice next time for my kids (maybe only 1/4 tsp. red pepper for them).

Partner said this actually let him enjoy collard greens. I was absolutely gobsmacked that I enjoyed it! Per reviews, used chicken broth in place of water and added sausage along with the beans to make it more of a main dish. What really added some umph! was mixing the red pepper flakes, sugar, and cider vinegar at the very start. The vinegar was infused with the spiciness by the time it went in to the pot.
I've tried various ways to like collard greens and end up throwing away most of a yucky recipe. Thanks to this recipe, we won't be struggling over what to do with the collard greens that appear so often in our weekly CSA box. We didn't just tolerate it - we loved it!

Made a vegetarian version, using olive oil to cook the onions and garlic, and vegetable stock in place of water to make up for the missing flavor from the bacon. Still turned out amazing! A great healthy meal served over brown rice or quinoa.

This was fantastic. When I read the recipe I didn't understand how something this simple could be so good. It was a huge hit with my husband and little one as well. I served it over rice with a side of cornbread and it was a nice dinner on a cool October evening.

So, I only loosely followed this recipe, but my easier version was delicious. I fried 3 slices of bacon, then added about half an onion and couple cloves of garlic, then the bacon again and about a cup (ish - 4 or 5 big leaves) of collard greens. Then I threw in a dash of white vinegar, maybe 1.5 tbspns of brown sguar, and a couple sprinkles of red pepper flakes. I covered it with water and let it cook uncovered on medium low for maybe 20 minutes. It was SO DELICIOUS. Bacon grease and brown sugar = hard to go wrong!

I made some changes, I cooked onion and garlic separately because of a food allergy. my husband incorporated them into his part of the recipe. it was a definite keeper. I added a can of tomatoes and used broth instead of water. had never had collards before but I liked these

Good dish but the flavors didn’t work for me. I found the cider vinegar and brown sugar not desirable and will stick with greens that have chicken broth and spice.

I loved this. I had some pork sausages that needed to be used so I substituted them for the bacon and it still tasted so very good. I'll definitely make this again. Thank you. :-)

 I changed my rating from 4-5 because I 'have to' have this so often since I found this recipe.  :-)

Fantastic.   Great sweet-spicy flavor.  I made it per the recipe other than using vegetable broth instead of water.  Simmered for about an hour and they were soft perfection.

I've made this several times and love it. I've never made it with the beans, just collards. I used chicken broth instead of water. One teaspoon of red pepper flakes was a little spicy for me (perhaps because I didn't add the beans). I cut the red pepper flakes in 1/2. Best collards ever!!  Someone was right when they said "the longer you cook them, the better they are". Don't skimp on the cooking time.

This will go on my list of regulars! It was delicious. The only change I made was using less bacon than recipe called for & it took more water to nearly cover the greens.  It is a great combination of flavors.

I love this recipe!  The only changes I made was instead of bacon I put a ham hock in the greens as they cooked. Then I shredded the ham and added it to the greens. I also used chicken broth instead of water. This is one of my favorite recipes!

We received a big bunch of collard greens in our bountiful basket this week.  This recipe was our first attempt at cooking with them--- added extra chili flakes and got the dish a little too spicy.  Also used baby butter beans instead of cannellini - which turned out just fine.  Didn't cook as long as recipe said... Greens had a nice texture.

I made this last night and it was a big hit with my Tennessee born husband.  I pretty much followed this recipe except for the bacon and used chicken stock instead of water. I substituted  a smoked ham hock for bacon and made half a recipe.  Only used a tiny bit of red pepper flakes. At the end, I added some smoked beef sausage cut into bite sized pieces and it made a complete meal.   Next time I will use the bacon.  I think the vinegar and brown sugar is what makes this recipe stand out.    A good basic recipe, easy to make and I thank you.  Did not use sour cream or parm. cheese as I think that would make it more Italian than Southern.
