Super easy. Great for something healthy and quick. I used Montreal Chicken spice instead of Seasoned Salt. Awesome Recipe. Thanks.

Very good and very easy - I used lime juice and olive oil.  I cut the seasoned salt down to 1/2 tsp. and used minced garlic from the jar vs. garlic powder.  I also added 1/4 cup of orange juice to give it more of a citrus flavor.  I pounded the chicken down thin and let it marinate all day.  It turned out very moist and tender.

Mmmm! This marinade is SO good! I made this for a bridal shower where we had a salad bar. I used olive oil and marinated the chicken overnight, then grilled and sliced it to use as a salad topping. Everyone RAVED about it and I had a lot of requests for the recipe. Next time I might try the canola oil though. I used olive oil because it was healthier, but the flavor was definitely noticeable and I'd like to see how the other flavors come out if using a less flavorful oil. This a perfect recipe for grilling!

My husband, kids, and I really liked this.  The only thing I changed was to add some lime zest to it.  I made extra marinade and used it the next day with the leftover chicken in a chicken pasta salad.  It was great!

This was tasty.  I didn't have basil, so I used italian seasoning and added fresh cilantro.  Also used both lime and lemon juice.  Will definitly use again.  Thanks!

Since I have a garden full of fresh herbs I used this recipe as a starting point. I went a little crazy  picking a few too many herbs but just had to use them all. In a bowl I combined the zest and juice of one lemon, the olive oil and I used approximately one tablespoon each of the following fresh herbs: rosemary, thyme, sage, chives, parsley, and lemon balm. Instead of garlic powder I minced one garlic clove and added 2 tablespoons of worcestershire in place of the salt. I let the chicken hang out in the marinade for almost 24 hours. I had frozen extra chicken breasts from two different packages of chicken and used a total of 4 breast halves. Two pieces of the chicken turned out real juicy and tender and the other two were more firm and dry. The final result will depend on your chicken. I've tried similar recipes using dried herbs and they turned out fantastic - I just happened to have fresh on hand and love it even more that way. Thanks for the great recipe Victoria!

This was a very interesting yet tasty chicken. I won't make it too often because it isn't amazing, but it is very good to have when you get bored of the other great chicken recipes.

Loved this recipe!  I too, added lime zest, and I used lot's of fresh basil instead of dried.  We did find this a bit too salty, so next time I will use less seasoning salt.  Very tasty!!

I made 2 times the marinate because I had 3 chicken breasts.  I used 2 lemons and 1 lime, only 3 tablespoons of evoo and a chicken seasoning blend instead of seasoned salt (we don't like it) and no garlic since the seasoning blend had a lot of garlic in it.  Marinated in the full amount of marinate for about 8 hours.  The flavor was throughout the breast and they grilled up super juicy.  Not our favorite chicken but nice and light after a long afternoon of hiking.  Will make again.

We enjoyed this, but it didn't make us go WOW like many others have said.  It's quick and easy, and most important, it's a healthy entree.  For anybody doing Weight Watchers Plus, this calculates to 5 points.  Thanks Victoria for sharing your recipe.

Great taste. I will be making this again. I didn't change anything. I only used lemon juice, no lime juice.

Really tasty chicken. Shared this recipe with a neighbor and her family really enjoyed it as well. Super easy to make and yet it tastes like you really put some effort into it!

Loved this marinade!!!  I marinated a turkey "london broil" for most of the day and then grilled. I then brought the rest of the marinade to a boil for a few minutes and used as a dipping sauce. I used the juice from a whole lemon and a whole lime, used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder, kept the seasoning salt measurement the same and doubled the rest of the herbs and also added some fresh cracked pepper.....really nice citrus-y  flavors. Thanks!
