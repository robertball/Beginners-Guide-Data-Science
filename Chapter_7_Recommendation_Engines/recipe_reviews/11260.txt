The reviews posted must not be from an Italian! This was a good recipe.  The directions are just what I have been taught from my grandmother.  If your cookies are not crisp then your oil isn't hot enough.  If there not good the 2nd day then you haven't used air tight storage.  To keep the cookies at there best you should wait until serving to put the honey on them.  Oh and no this isn't a quick cookies to make.  Plan on taking your time and know that you will be at this for a while.  My only other suggestion is that you can cut the dough into dimonds and slice a slit in the middle and fold one side through the hole, then fry.

Apparently some of you are not bakers. You cannot drench a fried cookie in honey. This is a time consuming, and must have patience recipe. My family bakes them often, and they stay for days if stored in an airtight container. After the cookies come out of the fryer, drain on paper towels, then sift powdered sugar all over them. Drizzle the honey right before being served, not before you store them.Drizzle is the operative word. Try the recipe again. I had to make several batches before I got them right.

This is a decent recipe. At my house, there were some additions to the recipe that strengthen the success of this fabulous cookie. A teaspoon of vanilla or orange extract will liven it up. Besdies the already noted input that the oil needs to be HOT, as hot as you can go without burning the oil, the cookies themselves should be thin. The thinnner you can get them, the better they will fry and the crisper, and less oily they will appear. While shopping at a local Italian market in San Diego, I came across a cute little cookie company, Cookies con Amore,  that actually makes these in a variety of flavors. They did not have the honey, but they were REALLY close to what my Nonna used to make!

we may not all be bakers, and obviously even bakers make mistakes but the recipe is pretty well written. The key to these cookies is the temperature of your oil, I would suggest frying some test strips, but what do I know I'm obviously not a baker

I have been making these with my Italian mom for years as this was her favorite cookie.  These keep well for weeks in kept in air tight containers which may be hard to find as these are large and fragile cookies.   We did add flavorings, like vanilla, or anise or rum to enrich the flavor. We also used the pasta machine instead of rolling out, with 6 selections on the machine, we rolled to number 5, then cut them into strips and made a slit in the center pulling one end through the slot making a bowtie effect.  Mom would roll and I would cut.  We dusted with XXX sugar when cooled but did not use honey.  Mom is gone but these cookies remind of her often and make them just in her honor. smokeygal

Mine puffed up - not flat.  I did refrigerate the dough overnight - could that have been the problem?
