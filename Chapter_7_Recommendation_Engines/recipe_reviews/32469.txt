One of my favorite summer drinks. I make this with homemade lemonade made with Truvia and homemade sun tea. My husband and I can go through a pitcher a day. Very refreshing!

Didn't care for this; thought it needed to be sweeter. Perhaps, it was the type of lemonade I used. Just too much lemon and not enough tea taste for me.

Excellent - the classic "Arnold Palmer!" I used already sweetened tea so I didn't need to add the sugar. Because it's light and just pleasantly sweet it goes down easy and definitely quenches your thirst.  No wonder golfers love it!

My kids love the Snapple Half n Half, so when I came across this recipe I was happy. Never would have thought of doing this. But its a lot cheaper than the other stuff :) Skipped the sugar since the lemonade added enough sweetness to it. Kids loved it. I think they were mostly happy that they don't have to wait for a trip to the store where I'm willing to fork over the $ for a drink :) Great way to use up your leftover tea and lemonade as well! Thanks for this!
