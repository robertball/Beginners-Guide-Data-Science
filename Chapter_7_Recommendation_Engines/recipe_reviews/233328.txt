I thought this was more sweet than savory, but it was very good nonetheless.  I only added a couple of sprinkles of cayenne pepper, and that gave it just the right kick for my taste.  I also served with an over easy egg on top and loved the creamy yolk mixed in with the soft sweet potato and ham mixture.  This was a healthy and filling breakfast for me, and I will definitely be making this again.

This was wonderful. I actually used this as a "jumping off" recipe and it turned out very nicely.  I added one ingredient, some diced apple.  Due to making it for a crowd I increased everything(except the cayenne) and baked it, layered (1/2 the potatoes first on which I sprinkled the cinnamon, cayenne and brown sugar, then the apples/onions, topped with the ham, then repeated)  in a 9 x 13 dish with just enough water to cover the bottom of the dish, altho I think apple or orange juice would work great. I dotted the top with 6 thin pats of butter- did not use the oil called for- and covered it with foil during baking.  Flavor was great and it was a perfect brunch dish.  It took longer to bake than I thought it would; it cooked at 350 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours to get the potatoes soft ( I had pre-microwaved the potatoes but they were still pretty hard when I loaded the casserole).

I make this all the time!  Instead of the seasonings described, I use 1/4 tsp each onion powder and garlic powder, makes it savory.

This was fantastic, made no changes hubby loved them. Made them twice first time with the ham. Second time forgot to buy the ham so I fried chopped bacon and it also turned out great.

I had to make a couple changes because I needed a vegetarian meal for the night I wanted to make this.  So, instead of ham or bacon, I threw in a can of black beans, and changed the seasonings to onion powder,  garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I did put eggs over easy on top of it, and it was great!  :-)

The combination of flavors works really well. I had already roasted some sweet potatoes (with salt, pepper and garlic powder) so used those and cut down on cooking time. I cut the cayenne to 1/2 and it was just right for my mild taste.

Pretty good, and not unhealthy. I'm sure I'll make it again. I think the next time I'll finish it with a dab of butter. The mouth feel was a little dry.

Made it this morning and followed the recipe as is. Everyone loved it except for the cayenne. Next time I will cut it back or out. Also as suggested by another reviewer added an over easy egg on top and let the yolk mix in. Absolutely great!

I followed the suggestion of another cook and backed off the brown sugar a bit to make it more savory than sweet. It turned out well. My guest from another country asked for the recipe!

Really good base recipe for getting creative.  I've made this without ham, adding chopped apple and dried cranberries instead, and I've made it as written. As written, it needs a little kick of flavor - and not just more cayenne.  I think I'll try adding some chopped celery next time for crunch.

This was really good!  My husband doesn't like sweet potatoes but was willing to try it.  We both liked it!  I used a little less cayenne pepper than it called for because I don't like really spicy foods.  I also served it with an over-easy fried egg on top as others suggested. It's good without the egg, but the egg was a nice addition.  I took a chance on this recipe and doubled it. We ate it for dinner the first day (my husband went back for seconds) and had the leftovers for breakfast a few days later.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe so I cut up potatoes and boiled instead of microwaving. I’m looking forward to eating the leftovers for breakfast with an o Er easy egg on top! This is definitely a winner that I will make again.

Made the recipe as written and it was wonderful!  Added a fried egg with a soft yolk on top, and it was an amazing breakfast on a bitter cold day.  Since I love heat, the cayenne amount was perfect.

I made this sweet potato hash pretty much according to directions except I used leftover chicken instead of ham.  It was good and I'd make it again.  Seems to me that  corn beef would also be a good addition.

I too, used this as a jumping off recipe.  I didn't have enough of the ingredients on hand , just one small sweet potato and 1/4 cup of ham, so I took advice from other reviews and added bacon and a diced potato.  Added garlic powder too, and the fried egg on top. Hubby had corn bread with it. We both absolutely loved it. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS!!!!

I made this recipe for dinner last night---delicious! Served it with fried eggs which complemented it perfectly! The only deviation I made was the addition of red pepper flakes because I didn't have any cayenne pepper. A keeper recipe!

We liked it. We doubled the recipe because we had lots of potatoes. We doubled the Cayanne pepper and that was a little bit too much for us. It was eatable but the cayenne would’ve been better if we gone with half of it. We will make it again and go low on the Chyanne and add More white onion.

Left the ham out for the vegetarian in the family. Served with eggs! It was so good. Considering it as a thanksgiving side dish as a new twist to the usual sweet potato side.

As some cut back on the cayenne, I will in the future, increase it. Made it exactly as described (for once!).

I made it.  It was delicious.  I used bacon pieces instead of ham.  I ll make it again when I have brunch with my sisters.  I gave it 4 stars because my potatoes got a little mushy.  I know now not to over cook the potatoes.

swapped out ham for  already cooked pastrami chopped and well crisped up in cast iron; also added yellow and red bell pepper, chopped well and extra onion along with the sweet potato. Lots of fresh time adds a perfect earthy flavor  and of course top with over easy or sunnyside eggs. I make a huge batch and refrigerate, stays a week and is actually better after refrigerated. Also frezzes well; freeze in portion size containers.

Wonderful tastes.  No brown sugar, but substituted 1 tbsp of Molasses.  Used 5 pieces of thick sliced bacon instead of ham.

Very easy, smells and tastes great

Great breakfast with scrambled or fried eggs. The last time I made this I chopped up a half of a green pepper and used some left over pulled pork in place of the ham. Also I seasoned it with a 1/2 teaspoon of Montreal Steak seasoning to give it a little more peppery bite to counteract the sweetness. I use real butter (about 1 1/2 tbsp) in place of olive oil.

This sounded really good, but I had concerns about the sweetness factor (hence the 4 stars).  I used cumin and coriander instead of cinnamon, and had honey on hand instead of brown sugar (didn't need it). I lacked ham, so used thick cut bacon instead.  Added a poached egg...  and a 5th star.

I rated this without making it because it sounds so delicious and easy.  I do have a question.  Why is this 16 g fat per serving?  The only fat in the recipe is from a Tbs. of oil (14g fat) and a small amount from ham steak.  If this is divided into 2 servings, I don't quite see how it is 16g per serving.

I made this as directed, sort of. I used hot ground sausage instead of ham. I topped it with an over easy egg. The sweet potato and runny egg yolk helped temper the heat of the sausage. It was fantastic and so simple. I will definitely try it again with different meats.

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe except I used bacon instead of ham. Microwaving the sweet potatoes first made all the difference. A family favorite.

We LOVED this!  I quadrupled the recipe (and oops forgot to drain the sweet potatoes before adding them).  Probably used a little less cayenne (just because of family members).   So easy and really good!

This is terrific. Try it. Did not have cayenne in the house so I substituted Adobo spices and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Gave it a touch of heat and flavors in the Adobo spices where great with the mix. Put it over scrambled eggs for a brunch dish. Cooking time was fast and microwaving the potatoes was helpful. Will make again.

Simple and tasty. We prefer this without the added salt or sugar. The ham and sweet potatoes are sufficient. Loved the kick the cayenne gave.

Delicious. Used recipe exactly as written. Just added a bit of water while cooking to prevent sticking. Served with over easy eggs on top. Husband loved it. Its a keeper. Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
