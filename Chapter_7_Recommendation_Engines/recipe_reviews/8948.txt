Simple and delicious - I use half a bottle of Kraft light italian dressing and add minced garlic, cracked black pepper, italian seasoning, oregano, basil, a little white wine, 1/4 c. of olive oil, and a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary.  I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go.  This is great with a salad or over pasta.

A good easy recipe when you are short on prep time. BUT, I think a whole bottle of dressing is too much.   8 oz or 1/2 would be plenty for 4 chicken breasts.

I sometimes will cook my chicken in a non stick skillet using Italian Dressing only as my cooking oil. Usually when the weather isn't good enough outside to cook on the grill. It really gives the chicken a great flavor.

I have been using something like this for years as well.  I leave out the salt and add hot sauce (like RedHot).  You only add to taste so when mixed with the rest of the marinade it doesn't over power.  Not too hot just adds some zing!  My families favorite!!

I don't know what magic occurs when these 4 little ingredients come together, but the results are fantastic.  I cooked the chicken in a skillet, and it was great.

I used this marinade on 3 lbs. of chicken parts instead of the boneless breasts.  I marinated the chicken about 8 hrs., then baked it at 400 for almost an hour.  I poured about 1 cup of the marinade over the chicken before baking, and basted occasionally.  It turned out tender and tasty.

Delicious and Super Easy - I agree with the other reviewers - you don't need a whole bottle of dressing!!  I used a storage bag, added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of dressing, 2 tsp. of minced garlic, added 4 boneless chicken breast - sealed it up and marinated it in frig for about 1 1/2 hrs. turning occasionally.  Put in on the grill-it was 92 degrees outside so I just served it with store bought salads, and cranberry sauce on throw away plates - there was virtually nothing to clean up except for utensils. A nice, quick, summer meal!

If possible I would give this an extra 5 stars! I definitely will use this recipe over and over. The chicken was MARVELOUS! We served it over F.Alfredo (using this recipe on this site Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce). So simple yet so delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe. Like the others, I marinated my chicken overnight, I tenderized it with a meat tenderizer and then poked holes through it with a fork. Each bite was packed with punch and flavor...You have got to try this recipe.

5 stars for a quick and easy marinade. I thawed the chicken out first, then poked holes in it so that the marinade would soak in! This was a great summer dinner!! Thanks

I marinated my chicken in this sauce the night before a big cookout. The flavor was so good. I recommend it for the grill or the oven. Great!!!

This is how I always marinate my chicken for the bbq grill! I didn't even know there was a recipe for it? I don't add garlic powder or salt though, because there is plenty in the dressing. It makes the juiciest chicken. Be careful though not to marinate too long, especially over-night, because it will make the chicken tart and acidic and ruin it. I usually marinate it for an hour or 2 at most. Delicious!

I have been making this dish for years.  Since we watch our salt, I do not add any extra salt and even use the fat-free dressing.  We do not grill anymore so I just bake them in the oven at 350 until the juices run clear.  Delicious and low-fat and low-cal.

I used chicken breasts with the bone and marinated for 24 hours. I baked the chicken but it was dry without much flavor. I don't think I will make again.

Per other posters, made a few minor adjustments: poked holes in the chicken to let the marinade soak in, used fresh minced garlic, added a little dash of red pepper flakes, and marinated only about 5 hours.  Also used the oven instead of the grill to cook the chicken.  Came out very tender with very nice flavor. I'll be making this often.

This is a good old standby recipe for grilling chicken. If you'd like to save some $$, make your own Italian vinaigrette and add some minced onion & garlic. The vinegar tenderizes meat and the oil keeps it moist.

So easy and good.  I prefer using Kraft's Zesty Italian for maximum flavor.  I like to let it marinade all day in the fridge while I'm at work, and I do put a WHOLE bottle on 4 chicken breasts.  It really makes them nice and tender.

I have used this recipe many, many times and always have had great chicken results.  Its so easy, you can any style of italian dressing, balsamic, sundried tomato, etc... it is always great.  I have even added some soy or mesquite bbq sauce or even louisiana hot sauce to change it up.  The cold leftovers works great cut up on top of a green salad too!  Fantastic!!!

EASY! My whole family has done this for years. We never add anything to it, i dont think its needs anything else but the dressing. We use almost the entire bottle for 4 large chicken breasts. We bbq it during the summer or just fry it in a pan. Paired with salad or rice or corn on the cob and its perfect

I make this at least once a week, since I can use leftovers for just about anything.  I do it differently though.  I don't marinate the chicken, I bake it in a pan and use enough italian dressing (can even use lite) to just cover it.  If you put in too much it will just swim in it and really it's just a waste of the dressing!  The first night I might serve it with a side of noodles and a salad.  The dressing keeps the chicken very moist and the spices aren't overpowering so you can use leftovers for stir-fry's and fajitas!  Great way to cook up alot of chicken for many meals!

Ya a whole bottle is a little much, but recipe is great.  I use my vacuum seal machine to marinate.  Just put chicken in bag with marinade and then vacuum seal.  It really sucks all the marinade into the chicken.  I also use italian dressing as my cooking oil sometimes when coking inside.  But then you only need to use a few table spoons.

Wow this is great.  Used Kraft Zesty Italian dressing and 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic (instead of garlic powder).   Also had 4 boneless chicken legs and a large boneless breast.  There was plenty of marinade for the whole lot.  DS#2 BBQ the chicken after it marinated for about 6 hours.   Meat was juicy and great flavour as the dressing did not over power the chicken.  Will be making again.

This grilled chicken recipe is so good!!  I always marinate it overnight for best results.  The best way to serve it is sliced after grilling and serving it over the Caesar Salad Supreme recipe!!!  What a great summer meal.

I make this all the time. I pour off much of the oil from the dressing before I use it. I marinate the chicken for about 2-3 hours before grilling. Want to add something to the dish? Roast some potatoes. Put them in a pan and add more of the dressing. Cook them on the stovetop for about 10 minutes. OMG is that good!

ive been using this for years.. i dont add the extra salt or garlic though, as the italian dressing already has plenty. i also love this as a "base" marinade, and then when the chicken comes out of the oven/grill, i let my bf and son pick what kind of sauce they want to dip it in (bbq, siracha, ranch, etc.)  very good though!

So Simple, SO Easy, SO DELICIOUS! I didn't have much time so I only marinated for 1 hour. I poked holes in chicken breasts with a fork while submersed to get most out of the short marinade time, it worked out great!

So  easy and so  good! I pounded it a bit  to make the chicken even more tender. Dropped two chicken breast in a plastic  bag with half a bottle of dressing, set it in the the refrigerator for about an hour  and placed it on my Hamilton Beach  Grill, about 15 min. Tender chicken for dinner!~

I followed this recipe exactly as described and then of coarse like everyone added my own touch.  Instead of poking holes in the meat likes some may do,   I LIGHTLY (Emphasis on LIGHTLY) injected the chicken with a little of the Italian dressing with awesome results.  For those who don't know what an injector is,  It is a giant syringe to inject flavor into meat.  (Wa*M*rt $1.00).  Just be CAREFUL not to over do it.  Too much would definitely ruin it.  Great with a side of spaghetti or linguine and alfredo

Holy . I had no idea that marinating could be so easy and awesome! I marinated some chicken strips with my favorite Italian dressing. I didn't feel like I needed anything else to add to the dressing, but maybe it depends on your personal tastes and the brand. I also didn't use the entire bottle - I used about half, but it probably depends on how much chicken there is. I also was short on time, so only marinated 1.5-2 hours, and it was still so flavorful and tender! I grilled them on the Foreman grill for 7 minutes. Seriously, I've never had chicken this easy AND delicious. Try this. I command you.

So simple and quite tasty for the little prep involved.  I used a packet of Good Seasons to make my dressing and added garlic powder, onion powder, and a little sugar to that (which is what I do when I use it for dressing) and let it marinate for about a day and a half.  It was so juicy and tasty.  We had the leftovers for lunch today and it was still juicy (even after microwaving!).  Will definitely use again when I'm being lazy!

This is a great marinade.  I had chicken in the fridge that I needed to use and only had an hour to marinate. I found this recipe and it was exactly what I was looking for.  I put the chicken in a ziploc freezer bag which I think makes the marinade more potent and I only used enough Italian dressing to cover the chicken (instead of a whole bottle, which I thought was too much.)  I grilled the chicken in a grilling pan and served it with steamed vegetables and pasta.  The chicken was very flavorful and tender.  I only gave it four stars, though, because it was a little salty--next time I will not add extra salt and use a low-salt Italian dressing. Nevertheless, I will be making this marinade again.

Been doing this for almost 20 years! I usually keep a Tupperware marinade going with chicken and italian salad dressing (fat free). Depending on my mood I bake, fry or grill the chicken. I have never added salt but I guess if you have a tougher chicken it would help tenderize. We use this for salads, main dishes, protein snacking, shredded and frozen for other dishes, etc. We also like to cube the chicken and put on skewers for a shish-k-bob bar-b-q in the summer.

This had a very good flavor, but seemed a little dry.
I don't know why.
I tenderized by poking holes, and let it marinade for 4.5hours.
I will try again overnight marinade, and cook on my indoor grill.
But this is very very good.
Thanks!

At first, I only gave it a 4 star rating as I followed the recipe (without quite as much dressing.) Kind of ~meh~
It DID however, become a 5 star rating the second time when I added an equal amount of brown sugar as the Italian dressing, and some cayenne for zip. I dissolved it on the stove, let it cool, covered and marinated the chicken (I used leg quarters) for about 6+ hours in the fridge, then cooked it up.  I baked it covered, in the oven in the marinade for about 35 minutes on 350º, took it out of the marinade, put it on a foil covered cookie sheet and let it "get sticky" for about 15 more minutes.  WOW, what a GREAT meal that turned out to be!  I served it with warm homemade pasta with cherry tomatoes, onions, extra sharp cheddar chunks and a bit of the same Italian dressing.  SUPER GOOD!

A great recipe.  The chicken came off the grill incredibly tender and more moist than I've ever had chicken.  My husband is still raving about this chicken and we'll probably have to grill our chicken using this marianade from now on!

Very easy, but I agree a whole bottle is too much. I used about half a small bottle for 4 chicken breasts, and that was plenty. The dressing gives the chicken a tangy flavor.

This is an old standby recipe that i have been using for years. I don't think I have ever used a full bottle of dressing though...I just use enough to cover however many chicken breasts I make. I usually add some minced garlic too but I love garlic. For me, these don't have enough flavor to stand on their own (unless you dip them in A1 sauce) but they are really good to use combined w/ pasta dishes & salads.

Great recipe & so simple!  I had guests coming over and I was in a cooking rut.  I needed something new and tasty.  This was great.  I marinated it with an 8 ounce bottle of Zesty Italian dressing from Kraft and a teaspoon or so of minced garlic.  I used 6 pieces of chicken and marinated it for what ended up being 6 hours.  And then we grilled it.  It was the best thing ever!  It will go in my rotation of cooking!  Highly recommmend.

This is a very good recipe.  Per other reviewers, I put half of the Italian dressing and added more garlic powder. I marinated it overnight to make sure the chicken will fully absorbed the marinade. Oh, boy, it is so delicious. Made it twice for a week.

Good easy recipe, I agree with other reviewers that a whole bottle of dressing is overkill. What I did was to cover breasts with dressing, then stab breasts with a fork to force marinade inside chicken. Came out great...

Great Marinade.  I ended up baking the chicken since it was raining outside and it turned out great.

This was our go-to recipe before I started experimenting with other marinades. I think this particular recipe calls for a bit too much dressing but otherwise is wonderful (I'd halve it for that amount of chicken.) We also prepared drum sticks this way - quick and delicious!

was very easy and simple to make. The only thing I did was I followed the directions,let it marinate overnight, then put it all in a slow cooker on low for 7 hours. It just fell apart!

I used chicken thighs and they were moist and tasty. I only marinated them for about 7 hours, though. Didn't catch the part about marinating overnight. They were still good! Didn't add salt.  My husband asked for these again!

I've been using this recipe for years.  Any salad dressing you like works as a marinade.  My family especially likes it with creamy caesar dressing.  You probably don't really need salt if you use a commercial dressing.

My husband is not a fan of grilled chicken because it dries out easily.  I made this for him, but I used chicken breasts with skin and bones and it was absolutely AMAZING.  He ate two huge breasts and is asking me to make again next week.

Delicious. I took a whole chicken, cut it in half, and used the Zesty Italian dressing for marinade for 6 hrs. Used the lemon pepper to sprinkle on before grilling. Also sprinkled on some Italian Seasoning, only because I'm an Italian Sesoning freak. Forgot to add the garlic powder.

i agree with what everyone else has said--you definitely do not need an entire bottle of dressing. half was more than enough! i let it marinate about 6 hours, and cooked on the grill about 7-8 minutes each side...they turned out really well!! barely had to use a knife to cut the meat, and tenderizing and poking the chicken with a fork really helped the chicken absorb all the flavors. will make again for sure!

I set out to disagree with all the reviewers because this was just too simple. I'm stunned, however, that my family chose this vs. "Unbelievable Chicken" (also on All Recipes). I agreed with them, simply delicious. PS-I pounded the chicken breasts to make them accept the marinade more.

I don't even like Italian dressing normally, but it makes a killer marinade. Add fresh garlic for a more garlicky flavor. I added a tablespoon of dried rosemary. Add whatever herbs you like. Easy and delicious!

This is what I call an old standby.  It is a no brainer.  We love it.  Ususally make it with less dressing (just enough to cover the meat).  If making skewers, I also put the cut up veggies in the bag with the dressing.  Cook and enjoy!!

I made this chicken last night but had to cook indoors because it started to rain. I thought it was pretty good...next time I might add a little more salt...I baked in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes and then placed it under the broiler for 5 minutes to finish it.

A very easy recipe -- I omit the salt and garlic powder and use the zesty italian dressing. You don't need a whole bottle, just enough to coat the chicken in a large zipper top bag! Delicious

I always use salad dressing to marinate my chicken and add in some additional seasonings. I've used it on both boneless and bone-in chicken pieces. It's important to use an oil-based dressing. The low-fat or fat-free versions don't seem to give the meat near as much flavor. For a quick week-night meal I put the boneless chicken in baggies with the marinade the night before and then pop them in the oven or on the George Foreman grill the next night. They are ready in about 15 minutes. They are always moist, flavorful and cut like butter!

This is an excellent marinade.  I do use the whole bottle of dressing because I usually do 6 boneless breasts.  I do not add any salt.  Every time we open the fridge we flip the chicken over.  I haven't grilled it yet, only baked.  It has been very moist every time.  Husband is not fond of chicken but likes this recipe.

This was a very easy and quick marinade. I put frozen chicken breasts in the marinade to thaw overnight, then I baked the chicken afterwards and it came out quite nice. Will make again.

Italian Chicken Marinade Haiku: "Sure, chicken was moist. But the flavor was lacking. Won't repeat this one." I marinated my chicken for a little over 6 hrs., so there was plenty of time for dressing-penetration; threw it on the grill, and was very glad that I served it on a salad b/c the salad veggies, dressings and croutons jazzed up what was otherwise a pretty dull piece of chicken. Definitely a star or two is deserved for no steps really involved to make this, but I think I'd prefer the steps/ingredients of AR's "Pretty Chicken Marinade" to the simplicity of this.

Beautiful turn out! This chicken was a hit at my house! I did only use 1/2 a bottle of Italian dressing. I added some Italian seasonings, onion salt, and some homemade pesto from a few nights ago. Came out AMAZING! Great recipe!

I've used this recipe since I was a kid. It's so simple and easy. I tend to use a half a bottle of dressing, but I cook mine in a skillet as I eat it all year round. If I didn't have time to marinade, I'll use the Italian Dressing dry packet as a coating. This is one of my favorite meals - especially if served with some garlic green beans and rolls. :)

This was pretty good but a little bland for me.  I used Kraft Zesty Italian dressing and added black pepper to the recipe along with the other spices.  I let it marinate for 4 hours.  The chicken was juicy but didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked.

This recipe was delicious!  I used half a bottle of Kraft Tuscan House Italian Dressing and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I marinated the chicken for 3 hours in a ziploc bag and grilled.  The chicken was heartily devoured!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Cooked on a George Foreman for 7 minutes. The chicken came out very tender. I followed other reviewers who only put half the bottle of dressing, and there was still quite a bit of marinade left over. I'll be making this recipe many more times as it is very easy and delicious.

I sauté the chicken in the marinade on top of the stove instead of grilling it.  This has become one of my boyfriend's favorite meals.  Effortless to prepare.

This wasn't bad- but I marinated my chicken a bit too long, like 2 days too long, so it came out a little strong. However, it was still very tasty and easy. I would agree, next time I won't use a WHOLE bottle of dressing, I had a lot of marinade left over.

This was okay but nothing spectacular. I only used enough dressing to cover the chicken, certainly not the whole bottle. I only had a 1/4 bottle anyway to start with and still had some left for salad after pouring it over the chicken. Our fire just didn't get very hot so the pieces didn't get a pretty color or nice grill marks, but the taste from the grill was there.

I absolutely love this marinade.  I use it when I make chicken caesar salad.  This last time I used it with the ziti alfredo w/vegetables (from AR).  I have also used this marinade when I make chicken souvlaki (also from AR).  I even use this marinade for portabello mushrooms when I am grilling them. Sometimes, if I plan properly when I bring home my chicken or steak from the store I place it in a ziploc bag with the marinade and freeze it until I need it. That way it's all ready to go when I'm ready to use it and it's been marinating a long time.

Doesn't get much easier than this recipe and I always have Italian dressing in the fridge that nobody seems to finish. I added a few splashes of Frank's Red Hot to the marinade since my fiance loves the stuff and I also omitted the salt. I didn't try this, but my fiance said it was tasty. I marinated for about 6 hours. Thanks :)

Can't go wrong with this marinade. I try to marinade mine for at least 2 hours (the longer the better...but sometimes we don't always have the time). The last time my husband and I cooked this...we added some diced tomatoes while baking. The last 10 minutes we added a slice of mozz cheeze to brown on top...we loved it! Finished the meal with some green beans, mashed potatoes, and crescent rolls. EASY...EASY...EASY meal!!!!!!!!!

This recipe has been around for years!!! In addition to the garlic I "beef" it up by draining off some of the oil, adding 1-2 Tbs of lemon juice (fresh if possible but bottled can be used),a healthy dash or two of seasoned salt and some coarse ground black pepper (to taste). I also use this recipe for Shish Taouk and also for Tabouli by adding fresh mint and substituting olive oil for most of veg.oil in the bottled dressing.

A college roommate always used to use this recipe and I think it's good.  All the salt isn't needed though.  Italian dressing already has enough flavor.

Been doing this for years, but just saw the recipe today.  I never use salt.  In my opinion, this is salty enough, and extra salt can always be added after it's cooked.  A whole bottle is too much dressing.  I just put about 4 frozen or fresh breasts in a bag, and probably 1/3 of a bottle of dressing.  You can also marinate this in a caserole dish if you have fresh breasts(don't take up as much room as frozen).  I marinate my fresh breasts for about 2 days and frozen ones 3-4 days.  Always excellent.  You can also use fat-free dressing, and it tastes just as good.

Easy peasy and tasted good. I used 5 small breasts, half a bottle of Italian dressing, and a teaspoon of minced garlic. Let it marinade for 10 hours and cooked in a skillet. Turned out tender and full of flavor. I served it with garlic alfredo noodles and will use the extra chicken in a salad for my lunch tomorrow. This is perfect for an easy weeknight meal that I need to cook fast.

I really liked this marinade! So simple and packed full of flavor! I did add a few dashes of smoked paprika, as there is already paprika in the Italian dressing used. It really gave it a great after taste and smoothed out the strong vinegar-y taste the dressing has. Either way, it's delicious! Will use again and again, family loved it! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and easy. Like most other reviews, way too much dressing is suggested. I used 1/3 cup plus the seasonings mentioned.  On occasion, I also add 2 T. white wine. If in a hurry, even a half hour of marinating in the 'fridge is good, too.  **7/2019 Forgot to mention that my mom also did this, but added 2 T. lemonade drink mix powder from a canister (Not Kool-Aid.) Sounds weird, but it mixes well with the Italian dressing and is delicious.

I typically like to make my own marinades because I generally have everything in the house and I can control the sodium content of what goes in it.   I needed something quick to marinade my chicken breasts in.   I used Kraft Zesty Italian and this took literally minutes to get together.  I did pound out my chicken breasts to 3/4" before marinating for even grilling.  I only used 8 oz. of dressing, 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and no additional salt.  I was very surprised at how much flavor they had and it made for a quick dinner.

My hubby is kind of hard to please, but he said this recipe is a keeper! I enjoyed the hint of Italian dressing. It wasn't overpowering. Right on recipe!!

So easy but gives excellent results - tender meat with a light flavor that the kids enjoyed as much as the adults.

My mom used to do this, without the added garlic powder and salt. I used a little more than half the bottle of dressing, added some red wine vinegar, minced garlic (in place of the powdered garlic), a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and, on a lark, about 3/4 tsp of a garlic/ginger blend (bizarre, I know) and a few shakes of Tony Cachere's. Yum.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was good and not too salty, although other reviewers said that it was. Not sure if I will  use it again. Seems to lack a little something. If I do use it again, perhaps I will add some fresh garlic to give it a little character.  Had to Edit this review 7-23-09 I have upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 4 because I have found that the chicken served cold after a day or so in the refridgerator is ever so much better than it was hot off the grill. Now that I have discovered this, I will DEFINITELY be using this recipe again.

Excellent! I used minced garlic as I had no garlic salt. Used a few dabs of Tabasco, and added Chef Paul Poultry Magic. Cooked on Non-Stick pan without any oil, just used Wish-Bone House Italian dressing w/parmesan, flipping often careful not over cook. Was absolutely great with a potato and beer! Thanks. Have 2 other pieces in storage bag marinating overnight for Father's Day cook out. Can't wait. :-)  This would be fabulous to pre-cook like this - thin slice, and pile over a salad for lunch. Yummy.  Note: Be careful with the salt, as the Italian dressing has high sodium content. I just used a pinch.

I thought this was a very good basic recipe. I added some hot sauce and some liquid smoke. Awesome. The marinade soaked into the chicken and made it so tender. Thanks!

This was really good. I was short on time & only had an hour to let it marinade but it was still good. I know if I could have let it sit for the 4 hours it would have been that much better flavor! Overall, great & easy recipe & I will definatley make this again! I think I will put some chicken breasts & the marinade in some ziplocks & freeze them for later use & then I won't have to let them sit for 4 hours to marinade because it will already be done!

I have been using Wishbone Italian Dressing for years as a marinade for chicken or shrimp cooked outside on grill.

When using this for shrimp, use large shrimp, wrap in bacon and secure with a toothpick. Then grill on outdoor grill.

My family loves this when we vacation in Destin, Florida!

My family and I absolutely love this recipe!  I've made it several times.  When I'm in a hurry I simply poke some holes in the chicken and let marinade for an hour and it's still EXTREMELY tasty!  So easy, soooooo good1

This is usually how I marinate my chicken (before I even found this recipe) - it's so quick and easy!  I leave out the salt so it's just Italian dressing and garlic powder since the dressings usually have enough sodium on their own.  My son has multiple food allergies, so as long as I use a safe dressing, this is a delicious grilled chicken that my whole family can enjoy.  An hour in this marinade is better than nothing, but if you can leave it for at least 4 hours, it's even better.

I used light zesty italian dressing and grilled on the George Foreman... which could be why we thought this was average?  Yes, the chicken stayed moist, but most marinades will do that for you.

Great-tasting and easy.  The chicken breasts were so juicy!  I made this for a cook-out for friends and everyone had seconds.  My 6-year-old son who is the pickiest kid on Earth, actually ate a whole piece!

Outstanding! My husband isnt a fan of Italian dressing!  He said "I would never have guessed".  And my 4 year old ate four bites (which is awesome for him!) So this marinade was great for the whole family!! Thank you for posting this one!

Easy to make, but my husband said it tasted too much like a salad using bottled dressing.  (He's spoiled because I made all marianades from scratch usually).  Since it's quick, it's worth it!

I always marinate my chicken in Italian dressing. I  usually let it sit for a day or two in the marinade and then toss it on the grill. It's the best chicken ever.

I did a two hour brine first, then marinated overnight. I agree with others, half a bottle works perfect as far as amount goes. Hard to describe exactly the flavor but friends just call it "delicious" which is good enough. With the overnight marinate the chicken breast were little difficult to fillet so I didn't . Long cook time but didn't dry out. Cooked until temp was 160 internal and they stay very juicy and tender. Next time I'll cut chicken first, then marinate. I did add some garlic salt and oregano. This is simple and delicious.

It is pretty good this way but if you add a couple tbsps of soy sauce to the marinade, it becomes possibly the greatest chicken ever. Try it. You won't be disappointed.

Used Trader Joe Balsamic Vinegar dressing - half a bottle - 3 large chicken thighs poking holes in the meat and pulled the skin away and dumped dressing into it.  Marinated a couple of hours, cooked on the BBQ in a foil container and then once it lost its fat and removed from the pan and put on the grill to brown it up.  We removed the skin to eat and it was fabulous!  Skin protects it from getting dried out

I used a dry package of Italian dressing.  Marinaded breasts and thighs overnight.  We bbq'd the chicken. My guests comment on the breasts that they were very good and I enjoyed the thighs! I would do it again.

This is pretty good easy chicken marinade. Whenever i do this marinade I add crushed red pepper flakes. It gives it a little more zest and flavor.

I love this recipe as is, but I also add to it to make a complete meal and get rave reviews from everyone who tries it. I marinate the chicken breasts in half of the bottle of Italian dressing in a ziploc bag but also add 2 quartered red bell peppers and 2 quartered yellow squash. I let it marinate overnight for extra great flavor. I grill the chicken and vegetables until done then thinly slice them all and serve them over some angel hair pasta tossed with the other half bottle of dressing. Sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top and wait for the compliments.

Only used a little over a cup of Italian dressing, dried Italian herbs, fresh chopped garlic,  red pepper flakes, kosher salt and fresh cracked peppercorn medley. I marinated cut up whole chicken overnight. Baked chicken in a transparent covered pan @ 350 for 2 hours (fell asleep!!!) The dish was AWESOME and moist. NOTE: I did not add extra marinade to pan while cooking.

Turned out great I changed it a lil also. I used 8oz Italian dressing, and 8oz sweet baby rays bbq sauce, and added some Texas Pete hot sauce. I marinated for 4 hours, when chicken was done I glazed a lil more sauce while it was on the grill. I think marinating it overnight would be better and soak in more.

I used chicken breast but I sliced them up and skewered them. They were a great hit with my guest. They were tender and juicy and I'm planning on making them again soon.

I didn't add the salt, and a whole bottle of dressing is just crazy. I used half a bottle of Wishbone regular Italian and garlic powder on 4 grilled boneless chicken breasts. Excellent flavor and very tender results. Will make again.

Simple, easy and delicious! I let the chicken marinade for more than 24 hours, which let the flavors meld well. I broiled rather than grilled the chicken. It was flavorful, tender and juicy. This one is going in my weeknight meal file. :-)

Good, but nothing special.  I increased the garlic powder to 3/4 tsp. and used seasoned salt (a little less than the recipe called for) and marinated the chicken overnight.

What a fast and delicious recipe.  It was so easy to make and my husband did the grilling.  I did add extra garlic powder since we both love garlic.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks!!

Delicious, quick and easy! We started marinating this 3 or 4 hours before we headed to the park to have a BBQ and it was still wonderful! Didn't quite use the whole bottle, maybe about 1/3, in a Ziploc baggy it was still enough to cover the 3 chicken breasts. Served with salad, grilled corn on the cob, and grilled buttered bread. YUM!

This is the best chicken marinade that I have ever used.  I pour the marinade into a plastic bag and let the chicken sit in it during the day.  I poke some holes in the chicken with a fork before putting it into the bag.  Come home and grill it on my George Forman grill.  Husband loves this chicken!  I can serve it with any old side dish and he's happy.  Quick, easy, and healthy way to prepare dinner (especially nice on hot days or nights).

This is so good.  The chicken came out so moist and flavorful.  We didn't have Italian salad dressing so I used Newman's Own Oil and Vinegar.  My husband thinks that is what made a difference (he doesn't care for the "tanginess" of Italian).  This is definitely a keeper!
