What a fantastic drink! I made it exactly as written and then tried it again without the vodka. To me they were just as good that way and much less alcohol.

I love Midori to begin with but thes drink really knocked my sox off! I made a big pitcher when we had guests this weekend and I ended up making another one. The taste is great but you have to be careful not to overdue it. It's so good you just keep drinking and drinking and drinking it. It is a fantastic summer drink.

This was a very good drink and went over very well for my family.  It's very hard to not drink them, and I think I'm going to have to run out and buy another bottle of melon liquor soon as I'm almost out now.  Yum.

I had a small party the other night and went out and bought a bottle of Midori.  I'm sorry to say it was a waste of money.  No one drank their drinks.

Since Summer is coming, I went and bought all of the ingredients for this cocktail.  I added a splash more vodka and a little more sprite.  I just made one serving.  I gave it four stars just because I don't personally prefer sweet drinks, but my neighbor that I made it for said it was fantastic and reminded her of a mojito.  Maybe blending the ice in would be an option.  Or adding a little additional acid to lighten up the sweetness.  But this drink served as is in chilled martini glasses is fantastic.  Great drink for grilling and chilling!

My husband and I don't drink soda pop so we substituted lemonade for the soda. Worked great. A very sweet and tasty summer time beverage.

I prefer a Melon Ball over this drink but it is still very tasty and refreshing.
