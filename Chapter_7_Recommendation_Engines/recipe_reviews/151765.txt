I DARE you to resist this cheesecake! This was my first cheesecake and it turned out very well. My girlfriend said it was the best cheesecake she ever had (but she may be a little biased). My only substitution was a graham cracker crust instead of oreo crumbs.  I have a few tips that a learned from different sources that may save you from a little aggravation... 1. Butter the inside of your springform pan for easy removal. 2. Don't pour the caramel mixture to the very edge of the crust or it may stick to the side of the pan. 3. Wrap the pan in heavy aluminum foil and bake in a water bath. 4. Let the finished cake cool in a warm oven for an hour before refrigerating. Good luck and enjoy! Then run a few miles to work it off...

I made this for my niece for her 11th birthday.  This stuff is sinful!  I toast my pecans at 350 for 6 mintues - toasted pecans just taste a bit better.  I always bake my crust after pressing it into the springform pan (350 for 10 minutes) then let it cool completely before putting the cheesecake mixute inside.  I used Chantal's New York Cheesecake for the inside of this.  It's actually not too far off (another brick of cream cheese, more sugar, another egg, 1/4 cup of flour, some milk, and sour cream). That cheesecake is much creamier.  I also followed the tips for adding filling so I swirled half the caramel and chocolate into it then reserved the other half for decorating.  I always do a water bath and highly recommend it.  After all that time, money and effort you don't want to screw up a cheesecake.  Just foil the outside of your springform pan put it into a roasting pan and fill it with hot water.  Bake the cheesecake for one hour at 350.  Turn the oven off and leave it alone for three hours. Take it out and then let it set in the fridge overnight then decorate. It's worth the wait.

Fantastic recipe (and so easy)! After reading previous reviews of it being very sweet, I added 1/4 cup less sugar (since there is already plenty of sweetness in the choc and caramel that is added).  I also substituted the melted choc and caramel cubes with hot fudge and caramel ice cream topping - and instead of putting it on top, I swirled it through the batter once in the pan and baked it the cheesecake. I then put crushed pecans on the top when it was done baking and pushed them on lightly when it was warm so when the cake cooled they didn't all roll off.  It came out absolutely perfect, and I will definitely be making this cheesecake again!

Great easy recipe. I did skip the caramel and milk and used Smucker's jarred caramel.

This is an excellent recipe. I will use this filling as my basic cheesecake from now on. I loved the "turtle" part of it but will try it with different toppings!

This was a hit! I changed it up a bit by not using the chocolate crust and I added walnuts and caramel along with the pecans and chocolate. Loved it!

F-A-B-A-L-O-U-S! Could NOT RESIST this cheesecake!! I made this for my wife and myself this Christmas. We absolutely love turtle cheesecakes, but never made one ourselves. After reading the rave reviews, I decided to give this recipe a try. The recipe is very easy to follow— However, I did slightly tweak the recipe.. Instead of Oreos for the crust, I used a store-bought graham cracker crust; instead of individual caramels, I used Hershey’s caramel topping; instead of baking chocolate squares, I used semi-sweet chocolate chips. Also, after I poured the batter into the pan, I took some caramel and melted chocolate and swirled it in the batter to give the cheesecake that pretty marbled effect. Basically, I took the advice from the other reviews and applied it to my own creation. It turned out wonderful—simply irresistible! Best cheesecake that I have ever made in my life :-D

I took this turtle cheesecake recipe and one other to the high school I work at.  I wanted the staff to choose which one was the best.  There was no contest, the Ultimate Turtle Cheesecake won by a landslide.  The other turtle cheesecake recieve one vote.  This is a winner!  I did change it a little in that I used oreo cookies for the crust. I also layered melted caramel, chocolate, and pecans on the bottom as well as the top of the cheesecake.

This is an incredible cheesecake! It looked fabulous and tasted even better. I made it for a party and it was eaten up within 15 minutes. I did toast my pecans in the microwave for about 1 1/2 minutes to intensify their flavor, and I'm glad I did! That was the only change I made in this recipe...and it came out perfect and tasted incredible. Oh, and the top cracked, because I was in a rush and couldn't leave it in the oven to cool, as I like to do with my cheesecakes so that they don't crack. It really didn't matter, though...the caramel layer covered it up, and made it look perfect. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it is one that I'll make again!!!

I was hesitant to try this because there were so few reviews, but WOW!! I am so glad I did!! It turned out absolutely amazing! No one had a bad review. The worst review was that one person said they usually don't like sweets and that this was very rich and they couldn't eat too much of it, but they LOVED it! I will definately make this again...soon!

The flavors of this cheesecake were good but the crust was a huge gooey mess. There was no definition between the crust and the caramel/pecan layer, the two just combined to mush. Adding up the cost of this cake (about $15) I was very disappointed . They ONLY reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it still tasted good.

I made this cheesecake for my husband's birthday. I was in a rush to get it ready for my husband's birthday dinner so we ate it the same day I made it. I would definately suggest refridgerating it over night. I refridgerated it for 5 hours and that was not long enough.It tastes so much better the next day. We loved it!
