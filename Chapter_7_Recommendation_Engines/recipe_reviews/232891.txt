I love the  balance of crispy an chewy along with the delicate flavour of apples. I chose not to add any caramel to my recipe because I would have found it way too sweet for my liking. Instead I substituted the caramel with more apples and it turned out fantastic. Would make again

I am about to make it again to use up our apple bounty and will definitely omit the caramel and, as one reviewer did, add more apple. It was very sweet with both the sweetened condensed milk AND the caramel. But to mitigate any objections I might get from this adjustment, I'll have salted caramel on the side.

I felt compelled to eat it because I spent time and money making it... and it certainly wasn't horrible or difficult to throw together, but it was far too sweet and not something I would ever make again.

Very, very delicious.  Next time, I will lessen the amount of condensed milk/caramel sauce as the amount called for made it a bit gooey.  However, that may have added to the deliciousness of it all.  At any rate, you can't go wrong with this recipe and it will be a crowd favorite.

Very easy to make and delicious. Next time I'll double the recipe and make 2 it went to fast.
