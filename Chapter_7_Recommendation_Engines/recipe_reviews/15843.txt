I had 2 chicken breasts leftover and searched for a casserole that I could make.  Most needed much more than 2.  I was about to give up when I found this recipe and hit the jackpot!  I changed this recipe from the original but I'm sure the original tastes fine.  I used 2 cans chicken broth with an extra 1/2 c. water for the 4 cups water for rice.  I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice and per directions 2 1/3 c. of water but added 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  I'm not sure how I could cook it per directions (wild rice) then not drain as all the water is absorbed, so I  cooked till it looked like the parboiled rice.  I also did not drain the mushrooms and added 1 c. ham cubed to the mixture.  It was really tasty and I like how I can play with the ingredients and feel comfortable that our dinner will be good!  oh yeah, I also cooked 375 degrees for 35 min. in our gas oven on middle rack uncovered and all was cooked through.

I added some chopped celery to this and my family LOVED it!  We'll definitely be making this again!  It was fast and easy for busy families.

This was too bland for our taste but certainly edible.  I would probably actually give it only 3 stars but I didn't want to mess up the rating (since I think many people might like this). Just a little boring for us. Not a bad dish but I doubt if I'll make it again.  I think it would have been a lot better with saut√©ed onions mixed into it and twice the sauce.  It wasn't dry but I think making it saucier would be even better.  I also topped it with French fried onions.  That was a nice touch.  I used a rotisserie chicken.  The nice thing is that I made two 8x8 dishes and froze one.  Although, I hope the next one won't be really dry.

This dish is quick and delicious.  I typically add more chicken breasts (up to 4) to make it a little more heartier.

I really liked this recipe!  I used 2 cans of mushrooms, one regular and one with portobello mushrooms.  I didn't add the wild rice b/c it was going to take too long to cook.  But all in all it came out delicious!

I used a wild rice blend, leftover cubed chicken and lots of mushrooms. I left out the onion soup mix (too salty) but put french fried onions on top while it baked. My hubby ate thirds!

Very  easy to make and tasty. I cooked n the oven and added a cup of chicken broth, because my white rice needed more liquid. Inexpensive also, about $7.50 for 4 servngs

This was a quick and easy. I cooked in the oven, just my preference. Used brown rice instead. The Lipton onion soup gave it a great taste.
