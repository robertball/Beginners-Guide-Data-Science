SO YUMMY! Because the batter was very thick i knew i wasnt going to be able to fold the raspberries in without it becoming mush. So i scooped about a TBS of batter into the muffin tin, dropped 3 berries in the middle and filled the tins with the rest of the batter and topped it with a raspberry on top. It was perfect!

I followed the recipe exact, only using fat free evaporated milk, only because I'm out of fat free half-n-half. These were easy to mix up and baked up beautifully. The smell of them baking was really out of this world. The boys just loved these. They look just like something you'd get from a fancy bakery.

we love these! the raspberry and white chocolate go great together. i just throw the chips in whole. they are sweet enough without the extra sugar on top so i never add it. delicious flavor!

This recipe is amazing! I used close to double the amount of raspberries and mini chocolate chips. I just used milk, cause it was all I had. I will be making this on a regular basis. I made two batches today and froze them for busy mornings and toddler snacks. Thanks for sharing!

These were AMAZING. They are just like ones I get from a gormet bakery in my hometown. And i've tried so many to try and figure out how they make thier SOO good. I'm so glad I finally figured it out! The only thing I changed was I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream because I'm lactose intolerant (coconut cream is the best substitute for heavy cream when baking, it's the same consistancy with just a hint of coconut flavor) and I used all vanilla extract. Although the batter is thick I still fold in the berries, but i also used frozen because fresh aren't available this time of year where i live. I let them thaw just a little to soak up the sugar but still be firm enough the fold in. It also works better as a bread instead of muffins. I've made these with strawberry/banana pieces, blackberry, raspberry, lemon zest poppyseed and plain strawberry. Everytime has came out amazing and delicous. Thanks so much for posting this!

Perfect muffins!  They are light and fluffy, not cakey, just the way I like my muffins to be.  I didn't change a thing and will make them often!  Just beautiful!

These turned out pretty good! I made 16 cupcake size muffins. I was shy one cup of white chocloate chips. Note that the batter will be thick. I didn't fold the raspberries directly into the batter, I just put a couple of them in between the two layers of batter. I placed one raspberry on top of each muffin as well.  Lastly, I just sprinkled the remainder of the white sugar on top right before baking, omitting the brown sugar topping. They baked up nicely in 25 minutes. These muffins are a nice light brown color with raspberries and its' red juices baked right in (see my picture). The muffins look and feel light and fluffy. They are moist and delicious muffins! The white chocolate chips blend well with the raspberries and adds to the texture of the muffns. I like the sugar topping as it has a slight sweet crunch in each bite. The ingredients, directions and baking time is approximate. Although I did end up with a few extra muffins I am not complaining, just more for me!

These were gorgeous! I have been making muffins of all kinds for years, and this is brilliant recipe. I made 6 texas size muffins and boy did they raise so nice, just like you buy in fancy bakeries. My granddaughters are picky eaters (5, 3, 1) and they scarfed down a muffin almost straight from oven, wanting more. I stuck to recipe only changing from white chocolate (yuck) to a few semi sweet chips, not as much as recipe called for. For those complaining about the berries bleeding into the batter, take your berries put them on a cookie sheet and put in freezer until frozen(if using fresh berries) before adding into batter. I have no bleeding at all. Girls and I will be making more of these tomorrow...(according to them). Also going to exchange apple sauce for the butter, to help cut calories...
EDIT: I made these again this am, to cut a few calories I used 2% milk instead of cream and apple sauce in replace of butter. The batter is still very thick but maybe a bit more stirable. It did not change the taste at all. So if you still want taste and cut over 1/3 of the calories just sub a couple ingrediants.

Very good muffins. I only used this half cup of sugar and they were perfect & not too sweet. great consistancy. I omited the almond and vanilla extract and used 2ts of matcha green tea. I also did as suggested and didn't fold the raspberries directly into the batter, I just put them between two layers of batter... yummy!

These were great, had some raspberries to use up that I was afraid were going to go to waste.  Left out almond extract since I didnt have any and left off the brown sugar because many reviews said it wasnt needed.  They are good warm or cold!

I followed another reviewer's suggestion to put the fruit between two layers of the batter, and all my muffins broke into two pieces! :( Also, they were overly sweet, even though I didn't sprinkle the top with white sugar. Finally, the batter was too thick, and gave the muffins a dense texture - too dense for me. I won't be making these again.

These were really good and baked up beautifully!  I didn't have any white chips so skipped them but can imagine that would have made this a FIVE star recipe!

Well I was a little worried to try a recipe with no reviews, but I am happy I did. These muffins were great!! Even my VERY picky husband loved them! The only changes I made was to omit the almond extract (not a big fan of it) and I only used about 1/2 a cup of chips as I ran out.

Made with black raspberries picked from our grove...these were excellent! I didn't make the crumble top, and they were plenty sweet and yummy.

I just loved these muffins.  The perfect combination of raspberries and white chocolate in every bite. I followed the recipe exactly.  The only negative was that out of 36 muffins ~ 10 broke when taken out of the pan.  they really had stuck!  Hopefully I won't have the same problems next time, as I will certainly be baking these again.

I made these late last night so should have been more careful. I forgot to put in the chips after I filled the muffin cups, so I coarsely chopped about a half cup and tried to push them down into the batter of each muffin. I sprinkled them with just the brown sugar. They baked just fine and are delicious. I will surely bake them again when I'm much more awake in a jumbo muffin pan. Really, really tasty.

Easy, decadent and delicious.  
I prepared as stated except I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon (because I think all baked goods need at least a dash), I used frozen raspberries so that I could easily mix them into the thick batter and I did not put additional sugar on the top.  These were some of the best muffins I have ever made.  Love, love, love and will definitely make again.

Just made these today and they are to die for!  I used white chocolate/milk chocolate swirl chips and raw sugar on top before baking, instead of brown and white sugar.  Yum!  And the kids loved them too!  Thank you so much Stephanie!  I am also going to try making blueberry muffins with this recipe.  I am sure they will be great as well.

OMG - SO delicious!!! I topped these with coarse sugar, and made muffin 'cups' out of parchment paper squares stuffed into an oversized muffin tin - SO beautiful and SOOOO good! Gave them as a gift to my mom and also gave some to a co-worker, they both loved them as much as I did!

I used Splenda and had a terrible time mixing the batter.  I didn't like te tast at all....not moist but doughy. I was so disappointed since I had read all the good reviews before trying this recipe.

I definitely backed off on the sugar a bit and did not add to the top of the batter - just overkill.  The thick batter does do number on the raspberries as you fold them in but the raspberry flavor was still excellent.  I think these would be fine without the almond extract - it was pretty prominent and did not enhance these.  I would also use less white choc. if I ever made again.  Thanks.

This recipe is delicious and easy to make. I was a little concerned at first because the batter was thick, more of the consistency of a scone, but they turned out great. I used fresh raspberries from our garden which are already very sweet so I only sprinkled the berries with about a tablespoon of sugar instead of what the recipe called for. I'm going to try them with dark chocolate chips next and then blackberries. Thanks!

left out the white chocolate chips and it was a bit sour - not sweet.  I blended raspberries - light pink color - and very moist.  Boys liked them out of oven - but 11 year old did not like them second day.

This was a good muffin, although something was missing... it kind of tasted a little biscuit-y.  Family enjoyed it though. If I make this again, I will save the time of chopping the white chips and just leave them whole.

I was a bit frustrated at the consistency of the mixture as it was more like cookie dough.  I added a 1/2 cup more cream, but it didn't help too much.  It was difficult to get the mixture into the muffin tins.  HOWEVER - the muffins came out wonderful!!  I would definitely make it again!

i made these with a few changes: substitute buttermilk for half and half--rich and it adds protein!- and i used blueberries and raspberry extract instead of almond b/c that's what i had. only needed 21 minutes in the oven- perfect!!

I made this recipe exactly as written, using the white chocolate chips.  The muffins were great.  I brought them to work and everyone loved them.  One co-worker said they were "A little taste of heaven."  Yes, the batter is stiff and the raspberries do get mushed.  That's just fine - they are great!

These were pretty good. I have a serious sweet tooth and would have preferred a little more sugar and perhaps white chocolate. I omitted the brown sugar because others didn't seem to like it. Overall, these were pretty tasty and I will make again with a few modifications to satisfy my taste buds and perhaps with strawberries since I discovered that I'm allergic to rasberries :-(

These were not very good. I followed the recipe as written and these were dry with lumps of white chocolate throughout. The almond extract is overpowering and not needed at all. I won't be making these again.

Don't add brown sugar to the top, that was such a wierd flavor it really took away from the muffins.  Very good though and will try again.

Delish!  I made just as the recipe states and they were great.  I did add some coarse sugar to the tops before baking for a little crunch.  You have to try these.  They turn out just like the big nice muffins in the coffee shops.

These are amazing and a true staple in our household!!  We have a huge Raspberry patch and get oodles of Raspberries every year and these muffins are an amazing way to use some of the Raspberries!  I've noticed that I like to add a little more Almond Extract (I love it!!) and in my experience, if you don't have cream on hand, milk works just as well.  A true yummy, tasty, moist muffin!!

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Absolutely yummy!!! No changes made, made recipe as is. As muffins they are so moist, I'm thinking I may use this recipe as a cupcake base.

These were one of the best muffin recipes I have ever made! The only thing I accidently omitted was the brown sugar on top and that was just because I didn't read that part of the recipe! I did fold in the reaspberries very carefully and it worked out fine even though the batter was thick.  I took the muffins to work and everyone raved about them and wanted the recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

My husband and kids loved these muffins, probably because they are super-sweet, but that it what I dislike about them.  I also found the batter far too thick to fold in the berries without breaking them, even though I used the sturdier black raspberries rather than red raspberries.  However, I would probably make these again for my family when I need to use up some berries.

I substituted blackberries for the raspberries and they were VERY good, except that the seeds in blackberries are large and I personally don't enjoy chewing them. If I make them again I might process the berries beforehand to get rid of the seeds. I was a little concerned because I wasn't very careful about chopping up my white chocolate and my pieces ended up a little big, but it turned out fine. Great recipe!

Loved this recipe and was very easy.  Even though the berries were mixed with sugar, my family still thought they were alittle tart.  I think next time I make them, I will let them sit awhile longer in the sugar.  Great for Easter!

These baked up beautifully & taste great-especially the topping! My only complaint was that they didn't come out of the pan easily. Out of the 12, only 7 were "gift worthy", the rest pulled apart.

I used margarine instead of butter, 1 tsp of each vanilla and almond extract and I used blueberries instead of  raspberries because blueberries are currently in season. AMAZING!!! My husband and I both believe that these are the most delicious muffins EVER!!!

These were very good. I wasn't sure what to do the 1/4 c of sugar mixed with the berries, so I didn't throw it in with the batter and the muffin was perfectly sweet enough. If I had added that 1/4 c of sugar I think it would have been too sweet. I cooked it for 25 minutes in my convection oven and it was definitely a few minutes too long. I used paper liners and the muffins stuck to them. Next time I will butter and flour my tins instead. Overall though a delicious muffin worth making again! Thanks for the recipe.

I changed a few things too.  I used blueberries and they worked great.  I increased the extracts to 1 full teaspoon each.  I used store-bought egg nog in place of the cream (cut down on the fat too).  I used skor chips in place of the white chips and omitted the topping of sugars.  Delicious !  I'd say this recipe is a keeper !

My father said they were the best muffins he has ever had. I didn't think the brown sugar topping sounded like it would fit the rest of the flavors so I just topped it with sugar and it was delicious.

These muffins were quite good, though the color was a bit off (but that was probably my fault)

Modifications:
i made these into mini muffins using those paper ketchup containers you get at fast food places (baking time 14-16 min).  I cut up the raspberries a bit to extend them across all the muffins. I omitted the almond extract (to be nut allergy friendly) and replaced with raspberry extract/essence.
