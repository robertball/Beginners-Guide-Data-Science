there is no number of sprinkles that is going to make me okay with eating the eyes of a deer. they don't even have a distinct flavor; it's all texture, so making brownies from them is just cruelty for no reason. somewhere there are a lot of blind deer all because you watched too much anthony bourdain.

These are really good and take minimal additional effort from baking box (or your favorite scratch recipe) brownies.  We prefer Ghiradelli brownies, so that's what I used (and used an 8X8 glass pan since they are a smaller yield).  I halved the PB and chocolate toppings to make up for the smaller pan.  I wasn't sold on the PB when I licked the beaters, but it really works on the brownies.  I'm super lazy, so I nuked the chocolate chips and butter for 45 seconds before pouring them over the PB layer.   I'll definitely make these again!  THANKS for the recipe!

These were a HUGE hit at our block party!  I have made them twice in 2 weeks.  They are extremely rich, but crazy good.  I made them exactly as written.

This was the Recipe Group choice for July 2015 and I am a bit late in preparing it. We used the "Duncan Hines dark chocolate fudge brownie" mix.(18.2 ounce box). There is no way the three of could consume the whole recipe (or at least we shouldn't) so I cut the recipe in half. I used a kitchen scale to measure half of the mix accurately. We used an 8x8 glass pan. It was fun to make and very good. I have to admit that we altered the last step.  Instead of melting the chocolate chips with butter, we omitted the butter and sprinkled the un-melted milk chocolate chips on top of the peanut butter mixture. TIP-Before you measure the peanut butter, spray the measuring cup with baking spray or wipe the butter wrapper inside the cup so the peanut butter slides out easier. Works for us. As other's mentioned, it is very rich. But we'll be making it again. Thanks for the recipe!

A little goes a long way with these brownies, as they are super rich and sweet!  I followed the recipe exactly, using a 9/13 pan.  We liked them but the consensus was that they were a little too sweet for our liking.  Maybe next time I will cut back on the powdered sugar.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Cindy Yonkman!

SO YUMMY! These were a hit at my work potluck. What wasn't eaten during the day people scrambled to take home. I used a fudge brownie mix for 9x13 pan and followed the recipe exactly. It was the perfect combination. They were a little messy taking  out of the pan because the brownies were so moist. But SO worth it! I can't wait to make them for my adult daughters who love buckeye candy.

I made this using the directions on the brownie box and I tend to like the brownies more cake-like so I add the extra egg. When I make this again, (because I definitely will!) I will make the more gooey brownies. I think this will be a much better texture.

I made a double batch! Just doubled everything and used my quarter-sheet-cake pan... took most of them to work, everybody loved them. The only "negative" is that once you eat one, you can't stop eating them...!

Major hit with co workers for a carry in dessert and neighborhood kids as well.   Mixture of chocolate and  peanut butter and more chocolate is a triple win.  Easy to make and directions are spot on.  Thanks for sharing

Being a OSU Buckeye fan, I will definitely make this for more football parties.    I used the Ghiradelli brownie mix which is for a 9” square pan.   I still followed the same recipe for the peanut butter topping and chocolate layers!   Just made it extra yummy!

I made these for opening day of the OSU Buckeyes football season.  They were  a big hit.  My  changes- I put my butter and Peanut butter in a bowl and microwaved on medium for 1 minute tile the PB was softened and then mixed the confectioners sugar  and 1 TBSPN of Vanilla in and beat.  I've made buckeye balls and this is how I do them also.

These are the best. I like to put aluminum foil and then put canola oil spray and so then I can wash the pan with the brownies on the counter. Anyway I will definitely make these again plenty more.

Although very tasty, mine fell apart when cutting into them. I followed the directions exactly including refrigeration times. But the chocolate came off as did the peanut butter layer when I cut them. Wondering what I did wrong.

I make these regularly for pot lucks at work, celebrations, and just because. They are a HUGE hit with my friends and coworkers.  Rarely are there any left for me to bring home.  I love buckeye candies, and these are a great alternative!

I make with triple chunk brownie mix and Simply Jif peanut butter. I also use Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips. These are very rich so be sure to cut them into small squares, a little goes a long way!

Super good! Made these for a family BBQ and everybody thought I had done something fancy! Nope! Boxed mix brownies, and SO good!

i didn't have a box of brownie mix on hand so made the brownies from scratch.  and i had some leftover chocolate butter cream frosting i needed to use up, so i heated it up and let it boil about 2 mins and it turned into the most fabulous fudge for the topping.  but this concept/recipe is fantastic!!  so rich, fudgey and yummy!!

It was a little rich, might cut back on the powdered sugar in the peanut butter layer next time, but I look it to a small Independence Day party and it quickly disappeared!

The peanut butter part was a pain to get on the brownies. They are massively sweet. I think if I ever made them again I would only use only one cup of powdered sugar. Not the best brownie I have ever had but not the worst.

Nice texture and presentation.  Peanut butter layer was too sweet even with low sugar peanut butter.  Next time, I’ll try less sugar and a little more peanut butter.

I made it exactly as written and didn't find it too sweet, although it is very rich.  A 1 1/2" square piece is perfect.  If making for a potluck or large group, this recipe is fine as written.  I would halve it for 2-4 people.

These were really tasty, rich but tasty. I used the Best Brownie recipe on AR instead of a box for the brownie. I halved the filling and ganache  since I was making a 9x9 pan. The filling was really dry so I added 2 tbsps of 5% cream, I used natural unsweetened/unsalted PB so that may be why. Definitely will make again when craving a PB treat.

Recipe Group Selection:  04, July 2015 ~ I'm late getting this recipe made, but DH is glad I made them.  I used a small box of Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate Brownie with chocolate chips, so I made in a smaller pan and halved the filling/topping ingredients.  They are incredibly rich, but everyone loved them.

Made these for Recipe Group (= These are very tasty! Luckily I cut them fairly small - because they are *rich* nuggets of yumminess (= I did add 4 more tablespoons of butter to the peanut butter layer - to make it creamier and more spreadable. I would probably add 2T more, next time, for a total of 14T of butter in the peanut butter layer. Everyone at work loved these (= Nummy, nummy! Thank you, Cindy!

Took my cue from the reviewer who used the Ghiradelli Brownie mix in a smaller pan.  They were sensational.  We loved them!  Not too sweet even with all the layers.

I used the best brownie recipe on this site and this was great!  I made exactly as described, but I used dark chocolate for the top for health reasons.
