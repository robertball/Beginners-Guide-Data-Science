I loved this. Added salt & pepper. Didn't have half & half so used 1-and-a-1/2 cups of milk and kept everything else the same. Great flavor and consistency.

This sauces  turned out great. Had to make something quck when I got home and realized I had l not purchased bottled alfredo sauce.  We made it with fat free half and half and light paPamresan cheese and it worked out great. I did add a touch more garglic salt and regular salt and pepper.

This was very easy and very fast!  I have tried to make alfredo sauce a few times with disastrous results, but this one was good.  I didn't have enough half and half, so I also used milk, and I added salt and pepper.  I agree with the reviewer that said if you want more flavor, add more parmesan and pepper.

While not the best alfredo sauce I've ever tasted, this recipe is excellent for a quick fix. I thought it had an nice, simple flavor, and great, creamy consistency. The only change I made was that I used 3 garlic cloves and left out the garlic salt. Then, I added a pinch of salt and pepper. Everything else I left as-is.  Those who complained of it being too bland: I wonder if it had anything to do with the type of parmesan they used. I used my favorite (in my price range) fresh parmesan, and it tasted great.   *Here's a tip for keeping parmesan cheese. I buy big blocks of it from the "big box" store, and when I get it home, I remove the cheese from the plastic, and wrap it in foil. I just shred as much as I need as I go. This way, it stays good in the cheese drawer for as long as 9 months!*  I threw the sauce over spaghetti noodles with a pouch of tuna and some frozen (thawed) peas, and served it with a caesar salad for a quick meal. All in all, the whole meal took me about 15 minutes. Great recipe.

Made as is, had a beautiful velvety texture and tasted great. Certainly was a quick and easy meal, with a popular pasta sauce, and no additives or preservatives. If you find this a little bland for your taste, bump up the amount of parmesan, and serve with a generous grind of black pepper.

I knew that when I saw flour in the ingredient list this was more of a bechemel sauce than a cream sauce.  A little tackier texture than what I was after.  Good flavor though,  but  wasn't what I was looking for.

Quick & easy recipe that turned out yummy.  Served it with some leftover baked chicken breast diced into it and over pasta.  I followed a few suggestions of others and a few mods of my own and it turned out great.  I used FF Half & Half, reduced the flour by 1/2 and increased the Parmesan to 1/2 cup.  Added 1/2 tsp black pepper.  Also added the minced garlic while melting the butter so that it sauteed just a bit.

This is an excellent, tasty, versatile sauce. It is certainly quick, as advertised. I served this over linguine with sauteed chicken, zucchini, and mushrooms.

I intended to make my own sauce tonight. Followed this recipe but used light cream and evaporated milk. I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt-added parmesean and parsley, salt and pepper, 2 cloves fresh chopped garlic and enough parmesean cheese to thicken the sauce. It smells great!! I will add the tortellini when done!! Thanks for a great, fast recipe!!

DELISH!!! I used ALL fresh garlic (4 cloves), sautéed in the butter first. Nice, creamy and cheesy! I do question the serving size, though. This recipe made enough for 4 of us with no leftovers. Thank you, diastase, for a delightfully quick and tasty recipe!

This was pretty good, but it was too thick. Next time I will use less flour.

Good and easy. I would highly recommend for use in any recipe calling for alfredo sauce. I double the amount if I am using it for a lasagna. Also, I added more garlic salt.  Very, very good.

Wow, I never knew alfredo sauce could be so easy. The sauce my mom usually makes is very time consuming. This was very good and I would definitely use again, especially when I need something quick. I doubled the recipe and followed everything exactly,but I used part half&half and part milk. The sauce ended up SO thick!! I ended up adding like an extra 3 or 4 cups of milk, maybe more. Even after that my mom kept telling me I should add more milk. So I don't know what I did wrong there. It could be I just measured something wrong. Oh well, it still turned out great. Thanks for sharing!!

Wow! This was so good! I didn't have any half and half so I just used milk. I also used more cheese than the recipe called for as suggested by others. Otherwise, made as is. It is amazing and easy to make. Next time I plan to use better quality parmesan and half and half - cannot wait to taste it that way!! Even my picky husband, who never eats leftovers, asked for more of this today. He was too late, though! The 3 year old and I polished off the leftovers for lunch!

I made this recipe to go with my pasta and porkchops last night.  It was heavenly.  However, I have a secret ingredient that I use in all my sauces that brings a whole new flavor...it is Herbmara salt.  You can find it in healthfood stores.  Amazing!

Not the best Alfedo I've ever had, but still good and super easy!  I think I would try leaving out the garlic salt and just sauting the real garlic in the butter and use half the butter and flour.

Just what i needed to add to another sumer pasta recipe from this site.  It was quick and easy and had great flavor.  You can easily add more spices if need be, but i didn't think it needed anything more than a little salt and pepper.

Exactly what I was looking for.  We had lots of leftover chicken from a bbq that I wanted to eat up so I made this sauce and threw in the chicken.  I only had skim milk on hand, but it worked perfectly.  I added exactly the 2 cups of skim milk.  I also added a LOT more cheese, probably 3x the amount the recipe specifies, twice the garlic and garlic salt, and I put in a bit of pepper.  So easy!!

This was too bland for my family's taste.  I added a lot of salt, pepper, ricotto cheese and fresh garlic.  I should have added some crushed red pepper flakes or finely chopped jalapenos.  It was easy to make, just needs a lot more seasoning.

This wasn't my favorite but it turned out okay. It had mostly a butter taste to it. It's a good base for Alfredo but next time I think I will add some shredded Parmesan or Italian cheeses to boost the flavor.

Quick and easy!  Added a little more garlic and some seasoned salt.  I also ended up using a tad more half and half because it ended up a little thick.  Great flavor!

This was easy to make.  My pantry was running low, so I didn't have any garlic salt, garlic, or parmesan cheese.  To compensate, I just used garlic powder, a 1/4 tsp of salt, and shredded mozzarella cheese.  The cheese made it a little thicker and delicious.  I stirred a little more than I would have normally, until the mozzarella was incorporated into the mixture, rather than globbing thickly.  I then poured this sauce over pasta and leftover ham pieces; DH and I loved it!

I made this for dinner last night , served it over cheese ravioli and asparagus, with a tossed salad as a side. Sorry, but my husband and I both found it to be very bland. I may try it again, with the addition of 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and more garlic.

Quick, Easy & Tasty! I didn't have fresh Parmesan so I substituted dried instead and it was still very good.

Easy and pretty tasty.  A little bland but I added a sprinkle of parm to my plate and it helped.

This sauce is so good! It is amazing it only takes a handful of ingredients to make, with really great results!  It is so much better than any store bought jar alfredo sauce!  Especially, without any preservatives and artificial ingredients. I have made it twice now. Once, with crabmeat and once with chicken.  Very good and really quick!

As written, it's a good base recipe, but it was very bland and way too thick.  I debated between 3 and 4 stars, but when I made it a second time I had to change it so much it wasn't the same recipe so it's a 3 star.  Recommend reducing the flour, add extra garlic, pepper, maybe some basil over the top and more cheese.  I used skim milk the second time and it helped thin it out to alfredo consistency (and reduced the fat) or add pasta water if it's still too thick.

I love the idea of a 160 calorie alfredo sauce. So this was something I absolutely had to try. The butter and flour combo does a great job of thickening up the alfredo since there is no cream cheese in this recipe. However, it really does too good a job. My first try on this gave me the impression that I should put the alfredo on a chicken fried steak or some chicken nuggets. This had too much of a gravy consistency for me. I halved the butter and flour but kept the same amount of half & half. I used a whole bag of World Classics grated parmesan cheese in it. For more flavor, I used (in lieu of the minced garlic) about 1 t garlic powder, 2 T basil, 1 t parsley, 1 T oregano, some kosher salt, and some pepper. (I'm just guessing on the amounts. I really just eye-balled it and gave it a taste.)

5 stars for this one. Super easy to make, but did not TASTE like it was super easy to make! I threw this over cooked spaghetti squash with chicken sausage and peas. My husband and 18 month old loved it. I did add salt & pepper and a bit more parmesan to adjust to our taste. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was awesome and well-loved by everyone here from 1 to 31 years old! I didn't have the half and half, as someone else mentioned, so I used 1.5 cups whole milk and it was perfect! Thanks for a wonderful and quick recipe!!

Pretty good. I'm not a big fan of alfredo to begin with so I'm probably not the best judge. My husband loved it though & it was very easy to make.

I liked this, as did my 2 and 5 year olds, but my husband didn't care for it.  It was the tiniest bit grainy, which might have been my own fault for using skim milk.  I also added a touch of salt and pepper and a sprinkle of nutmeg, which might have affected texture as well.  Thickened up beautifully, and I can only think how creamy it would have been with the half and half.

I didn’t have half and half or parsley and a minimum amount of grated Parmesan cheese. I made my rue as usual 4 tbsp of butter and 4 tbsp of flour then substituted 2 cups of whole milk. Since I was lacking on the parm I added grated whole milk mozzarella and provolone. It did make the sauce a tad thicker so i ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup of milk to thin it out. Added a pulled rotisserie chicken and accompanied by bow tie pasta. 

**** add Cajun seasoning for a Cajun Alfredo pasta

As written, this was just okay.  It reminded me of a very plain macaroni & cheese - the kids loved it, but I think it needed a bit more flavor.  This is a great base recipe for alfredo though, so I am not giving up on it!  Next time I make this, I would  add up to 1 cup of Parmesan - I think that's where the flavor is really lacking - not enough cheese.  Also, for those who thought the sauce was too thick - just add some reserved pasta water to thin it out a bit.

Very good base recipe for this sauce. I usually make a shrimp and noodle dish with seasoning that mimics shrimp scampi. This time I thickened it up by using this sauce recipe. Butter/flour/garlic salt/half+half and some shred Italian blend cheese. Added pepper and Table Blend Mrs Dash and it was amazing!

This was great! Very easy and I like how natural it tasted- this is so much better than buying your typical grocery store jar white sauce, PLUS I can pronounce all of the ingredients! 

I did not have any parsley but it was fine without. I only had shredded Parmesan cheese, but that worked fine too! I poured this over cheese tortellini and it was very quick and tasty,

I made this recipe for dinner tonight; I omitted the minced garlic (because I forgot it!) and doubled the recipe.  It is delicious!  My kids, 4 and 8, got to learn how to make a roux and my husband was thrilled to come home to home-made alfredo.  It didn't take long at all, and most of the ingredients I always have on-hand.  This is DEFINITELY a keeper.  I also made enough to freeze for other dishes.  I can't wait to try it out!

made this using heavy whipping cream since I did not have any half and half at the time.  Also used Romano and Parmesan cheeses in the mixture.  Sauce is a bit thicker but the family loved it all the same.  The different cheeses gave it a rich bold flavor.

Great recipe, quick and easy too. I used garlic powder and added some extra garlic and salt like the others suggested plus a dash of red pepper. Nice and creamy for such a quick, low cost alfredo.

Delicious!  Made 4 servings of this (1 cup) with the Absolutely Fabulous Portobello Mushroom Tortellini (by Staceyo) and it was a restaurant quality meal.  Replaced the garlic salt with 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, which was browned in the butter over medium heat.  Used 2% milk to reduce the fat content as well, and maybe about 1/4 cup parm cheese.  It was so yummy and so easy to make!  There's no reason to go back to prepared alfredo sauce again.

This was VERY quick and fairly good in taste.  Like the others said, it is a bit bland as the recipe stands, but could easily be kicked up in flavor with some extra spices.  Next time I might add a little Cajun seasoning in mine.  The kids loved it though! Thanks for saving my dinner tonight!

I used a mess of fresh minced garlic, more than the recipe required, and I omitted the garlic salt. I also used fat free half-n-half. After tasting the sauce, I did add more parmesan cheese. I used the sauce with Smart Taste pasta for Kielbasa Alfredo, which is also from this site. Quick and economical dinner, paired with a raw veggie platter, that was inhaled by my husband and two kids.

This was so easy...I did increase the parmesan cheese to 1 1/2 cups and used 2 T fresh parsley in lieu of dry, and ommited the garlic salt. The sauce was so creamy and tasty. Will make again. Used this with the Pepperd shrimp Alfredo recipe on Allrecipes instead of the jar stuff.

This was wonderful!  I added a little crushed mint and some rosemary as well as some extra half and half.  Delicious!  I used it for the sauce in a veggie pot pie.  Excellent decision!  I will use this again.

I was so excited to see how simple this recipe was and with all the ingredients i had in my kitchen already.  I added some diced up boneless/skinless chicken that i had left over from dinner the night before.  My husband and i loved this and i look forward to enjoying it again soon.

This was so quick and easy to make.  I made it on a night when I was cleaning out the refrigerator trying to use up leftovers.  We had a shrimp and crawfish boil, so I added the shrimp and crawfish, corn cut from the cob and a little left over baked chicken.  My family was very impressed with the results.  Because I was using what I had on hand, I used 2 tsp of Granulated Garlic instead of the garlic salt and cloves.  I also used milk instead of half and half and no parsley, but it was still wonderful.  After dinner, my husband was standing over my shoulder making sure that I added this one to my recipe box!

This is wonderfully smooth and silky. I added black pepper and garlic powder to the roux. It thickened up within seconds of adding the half and half. Awesome!

Great quick and easy recipe. I used a Parmesan and Romano cheese mix and added a little extra. I also seasoned it  a tad with season salt for a little more flavor. This will be my go to sauce recipe!

I used gluten free flour and it still turned out great.  It was a little thicker than I like, which could have been how long I cooked it.  Flavor was pretty good.

Absolutely the Best of the Bests of Alfredo Sauces.  Just finished making it and will be warming it up for dinner with our fav. pasta.  Followed the recipe exactly with only one change using Romano instead of Parm.  cheese (Dietary restrictions).  The sauce is not only easy to make but it is delicious, and the fact that it can be made ahead of the time, is fantastic.   No more jarred Alfredo Sauce.  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe.

Perfect quick and easy meal.   Added a little more parmesan and quartered cherry tomato for flavor.   My family liked it except for the pickiest eater.   I call that a win!

I've made this three or four times.  My family likes it.  Next time I'm going to half the flour so its not quit as tacky.  I think about 1/8 tsp nutmeg also.

I had only fat free half & half, decided to try it anyway. I used Locatelli Pecorino Romano, a bit of Parmesan,  a little garlic powder for the garlic because I’m out of fresh... Loosened the sauce up a bit w/ some of the pasta water. TO DIE FOR!!!! Will definitely make again! Wow!

I had never made alfredo sauce before and can't believe how easily this came together. I'm not a great cook and can tell it's almost impossible to mess this up. The only change I made was to add an extra clove of garlic and left out the garlic salt because I'm watching my sodium. It's still pretty tasty.

This recipe was great, except that I felt it needed more butter and grated Parmesan, and salt and pepper.  I will definitely make it again, because it was quick and easy and delicious!

So good, I added some cayenne and a little extra half and half as it was kinda thick. Served with some leftover noodles as a quick and delicious lunch.

Loved it. Didn’t have half and half so I used whole milk. Melted 1 tbsp of butter and filled the rest of the cup with milk for each cup I needed. Didn’t have garlic salt so I used regular garlic powder and put a splash of salt. The sauce was amazing. But I added broccoli, chicken & shrimp to the sauce after it was cooked so I added a little more salt and parm. Will use this again. I was in a rush and I just dumped everything and put it on high for a couple of minutes. Butter melted and kept whisking. I was lucky that it turned out great.

I needed to get rid of some half and half. Found this recipe and thought I would give it a shot (considering I am not an Alfredo fan). It is simple and delicious. Whole family loved it. We added a little extra cheese but other than that we were spot on to the directions. With just a few ingredients and plenty of leftovers this is perfect for an easy dinner night. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

I used fat free  half and half and lower fat Parmesan cheese. Also used frozen Normandy mixed vegetables thawed and heated in grill pan. Added left over grilled chicken. Also used Kamuta pasta.  MY husband doesn’t eat vegetables, is diabetic and Italian. So this worked well.
Great and very filling meal.

Made it a little lighter by using milk rather than half and half and it turned out fine. A nice, simple sauce for a quick family meal. Not a knock your socks off Alfredo, but was easy and tasty and will become a weeknight family favorite at our house. We're trying to go meatless at least a few nights a week and this was great served over pasta shells with garbanzo beans and broccoli.

I loved how simple, easy, and tasty this was.  And I loved the consistency of it when reheated.  I really changed nothing except I left out the Parsley flakes, and I used a  natural Parmesan cheese by BelGioioso.   Anytime I have ever followed recipes and tried making Alfredo sauce in the past it was always a massive failure.   Not with this one I'm keeping this recipe.  Simplicity at its best and flavor at its best but I must be honest I believe that this cheese made all the difference in the flavor and texture of the sauce (for me), because unfortunately other cheeses I have tried to use have that cellulose stuff in it for preservatives which would gum everything up but this has none of that and the flavor of the cheese almost had a browned butter flavor to it, which only added to this wonderful sauce !!!  Try this recipe !!  ***  By the way I have never left a review for anything on  this site.  This is my first one because I feel that strongly about how wonderful and simple this recipe is ***

It was ok...but I think there could be something better of the website.  I'll probably keep looking.  Didn't like the parsley in it at all.  Fresh would have been ok.  3 stars.

I normally don't care for people who review a recipe, and then go on to talk about how they changed practically every ingredient - that is not the recipe then.
I am giving a heads-up to anyone looking for GLUTEN-FREE recipes.  I made this recipe with 1 to 1 gluten-free flour (1 to 1 has xanthan gum added in the mix) and it worked GREAT! If you want a stronger flavour, add fresh cracked pink salt and peppercorns, and use more garlic and fresh parmesan.  It also works well with full 35% cream.
This was so easy, and exactly what I was looking for. Thank you for the recipe. The quick preparation time is fantastic.
Once the sauce was done, I added thawed frozen cooked shrimp a couple of minutes before adding hot pasta.

This is a good base; play around with the seasonings, make it thinner or thicker depending on the dish, use it alone on pasta or mixed with meat and veggies, etc. I have made it using half & half and using evaporated milk swapped out 1:1 - delicious either way. 2/11/19 Made it with 2% milk. Used garlic powder in place of garlic salt, no added salt. Tasty over tortellini!

This was fantastic! I don't think it needed all the flour because it was really thick. Next time I might use half. I also added a little fresh grated nutmeg.

This was a great basic recipe for Alfredo sauce!  I used it to make Chicken, Broccoli and Ziti with an Alfredo sauce.  It worked fine.  I had to use corn starch since I was fresh out of flour for some reason.  I was just careful not to use the same amount.

I used organic dried basil instead of the parsley. Used 3/4 of a stick of organic butter. I precooked some organic ground chicken and made a roux with the butter and 1heaping TBL Spoon of rice flour (rice flour makes a much better roux in about the 1/3 of the time!)  I also doubled the fresh grated Parmesan by adding fresh grated romano! (I also used the fresh pre-cooked pasta, tastes so much better than dried to me) YUM & EASY

This was a great quick and lower fat option for alfredo.  My kiddos loved it and asked to have again so that's a win win for this mom.  I will cut back on the garlic salt and just add more fresh garlic next time.

This was a very good Alfredo sauce. I'm not sure what I did, but I couldn't get it to get to the thicker consistency that I like so the ONLY modification that was made in my end was a handful of mozzarella. We made extra sauce and froze for other nights but this was easy enough to make for a weeknight dinner from scratch. Hubby said it reheated awesome the next day as well. #nomorejarsauce ! Thanks for the recipe :) next time I will try adding mushrooms or peas or broccoli.

It was more tacky than creamy. The flavors were fine. I used fresh parsley instead of dried and doubled the garlic cloves. May reduce or leave out the flour next time to make it more creamy.

Great recipe with tweeting! This is very similar to my grandmothers recipe, the basic belchmel sauce (flour/milk/butter ratio) that we use for a base white sauce. 
You can do a lot white a white sauce. One of our favorites is using it with our favorite cheeses (sharp cheddar, fontina) for Mac & Cheese. 
  For the Alfredo I used only the base sauce (butter/flour/milk, I did not use spices or herbs, only a little salt and pepper.)
Now, I also used whole milk, but I have done this with lowfat milk/whole milk combo, even fat free/low fat milk. I just increase the ratio of the butter/flour. 
A good tip is to warm the milk up in the microwave FIRST, before adding it to the butter/flour mixture. The warm/almost hot milk gives a smoother sauce.

I love this recipe. I hate the Alfredo sauce in the bottle and this is perfect!! I would definitely compare this to Olive Garden's recipe. I added chicken and shrimp to this recipe.

This was a pretty good, solid sauce that's perfect for anyone who's pressed on time. I was essentially looking for any recipe to use up my leftover half-and-half (which I had bought to make flan), and this did the trick nicely. I added a little fresh lemon juice and served it over fusille pasta with sauteed asparagus, shrimp, and a drizzle of chili garlic sauce for the spice.

I found this recipe searching for Alfredo sauce using half and half because I didn't have cream on hand. I pretty much stuck with the recipe except for a bit more fresh grated parm. I found it very bland. The sauce kinda solidified when it hit the pasta.  I'll make sure I have cream the next time I make Alfredo sauce.

I used probably twice as much Parmesan as was called for. As well as added pepper per others suggestions. I think it was quicker than my other Alfredo recipe I use. I would use this again.

I made it with 1 cup half and half, 1 cup whole milk(that's what I had on hand). I added 1/2 cup parmesan/roman shredded cheese mix, rather that 1/3 cup Parmesan. I also added more garlic(we are garlic lovers). Salt and pepper was needed, which i added as well. Came out great, would make it again.

This is fantastic! I scaled back the garlic to one clove because I wasn't sure if 2 might be too much for us...and it was perfect. Creamy, parmesan cheesy and a hint of garlic. Delicious Alfredo with Rigatoni and Broccoli. Yum

An easy and tasty recipe. Note that it makes for 8 servings. I think next time I'll cut the recipe in half since there are only three of us. I refrigerated the the leftover sauce and it had it about five days later. I used to buy those Simply Organic dried packets, but no more. This is just as easy. Good with some pesto mixed in it too!

You can use Parmesian cheese in a bottle.  And the flavor is the same as if you used fresh. Also Add Cajun seasoning to spice it up

It tasted wonderful and you wouldn't think its lighter than other Alfredo sauces but it is! 4 star because it's easy and it's with ingredients you should already have so it's cheap. Tastes better than jar but not restaurant quality I feel but definitely making this more often. Only thing I changed was I used 1 and a half cup of whole milk, doubled the garlic salt, and added hot pepper flakes and pepper. I didn't even have to add more cheese and I used low quality parm !

A bit salty, but a great overall taste. I used a little bit less of 1/3 cup parmesan cheese and it already had a strong taste. If you don't want quite a salty taste use less than the recommended amount of garlic salt. I also used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half and it came out exceptionally creamy. The butter did not blend as well though and if you left it for 2 minutes without low heat it got chunky and had a film over it. Kind of looked like curdled cheese. Though when heated and stirred, amazing!

Not bad but way too much flour, good flavor but more gravy than sauce.  I'll cut the flour in half next time and it'll probably be awesome

This works just like the recipe says! Yummy! Use fresh grated parm if you can because it melts better.

This was UNREAL! I've made Alfredo Sauces before but none have been as good as this was. My additions: I minced up about 2T of onion and added an extra TBSP of butter to accommodate. Tossed the onion and the garlic in the butter and cooked until translucent and added about 1/4 cup of Italian cheese. I also used Fat Free half and half and an extra 1/2 cup of Fat Free Milk to thin the sauce since the extra cheese made it a little thick. Tossed in some cooked Penne noodles and topped with Garlic and herb marinated grilled chicken breast. A-freakin-mazing!

I have been feeding my son boxed fettuccine alfredo for days because it was fast and he loved it.. no longer. Noticed the boxed had MSG in it! Barf.. never again.  He loves it! Quick, easy, and all ingredients I have on hand.

Four stars for ease and taste. One star off for texture - I cut the flour significantly, but there was still a graininess to the sauce. I don't know if the Parmesan hadn't incorporated fully? If I had cooked it longer, the sauce would have been too thick. I stirred in cubed, cooked seasoned chicken at the end and really liked this addition. Also used some regular milk to augment the half and half, and it worked fine. I actually didn't have minced garlic on hand, but we still liked the taste. Will make again.

My family loved this! I had some extra half and half in the fridge but not enough so I added 1c of skim milk. I followed the suggestions other reviewers said about adding additional pepper and parmesan.  My hubby is so picky but he asked for this again.  The flavor was great. I think next time I'll add a little less flour.

I was so pleasantly surprised by this sauce! The only changes made were I cut down on the flour based on other reviews (I could have cut down some more bc it still turned out pretty thick) and doubled the cheese. I also added salt/pepper, chicken, and used parmesan reggiano cheese. Very tasty for using half & half and such an easy dish!!

Good stuff, I'll use it again! Also added the salt and pepper. Half and half was good. I typically use cream, but half and half was great with this recipe.

I tried this recipe & like other reviewers noted, it needed some spice added. I used garlic powder & salt instead of the garlic salt, added extra fresh garlic, and some ground black pepper. Also I used Parmesan/Romano mix instead of Parm because that's what we buy. You can omit the flour and the recipe will still turn out creamy & thick. This recipe was easy, tasty, & family approved.

This was a great Alfredo sauce.  The fresh garlic is a must for the flavoring.  Otherwise, you might be able to taste the flour.  My husband said that when it was hot off the stove it was the best.  After it sat a bit and cooled, it got too thick.  I think I might have cooked it a bit too long.  Next time I will stop the cooking just as it starts to thicken.

Excellent! Nice recipe, fast and easy. As some people are saying on here, the final result can be a bit bland. And I agree. Luckily it can easily be fixed! Just make a quick adjustment to the cheese. As it only says 1/3 cup of Parmesan, I kept adding more and more until eventually the right rich taste came. I ended up plopping in a whopping 2 cups! But for the final flavor, it was so much better. Hope this helps! :)

This sure was easy! But I think I would reduce the flour to maybe and eigth of a cup next time I made it.  The sauce was prepared before the rest of the pasta and veggies were done and by the time I was ready to use it, it had congealed to a pudding like muck on the back burner.  Plus I think all that flour makes it a lot less silky than it should be.

Easy and tasty. I added some "garlic and herb" cream cheese to make it a little more rich in flavour.

I made a couple of substitutions, based on what I had in the house: whole milk instead of half-and-half, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Be sure to use "real" Parmesan cheese, not the flavorless canned stuff! (For speed, I shredded it in my food processor).

This sauce took me all of 8 minutes to prepare, including shredding the cheese, and has fabulous flavor that even my son, Mr. PickyPants, enjoyed! And it makes a LOT of sauce: I used it to rescue a big pot of chicken noodle soup no one was eating, which I'd made with 8 oz. of pasta and almost 2 lbs. of chicken. (I drained and froze the broth for later use.) Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Really easy to make.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any half and half, so I made my own using 2 tablespoons of melted, cooled butter mixed  into 2 cups of skim milk.  Added a sprinkle of garlic powder, black pepper and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg into the sauce.  Great! Thanks for a good recipe.

I hate store bought alfredo sauce.  
I've made this several times (and tonight). My go to alfredo sauce recipe.
I use fresh parmesan and grate it with a microplane zester.
The cheese melts easily.  I skip on the seasonings and add McKormick chicken seasoning instead. I'm addicted!
Thanks!

Used this recipe  to make alfredo sauce which another recipe on this site called for.  Very easy and although good for my needs, I think I will try another recipe next time.  Quick is what I usually need so I may be back.  Made with fat free half and half.

Easy Alfredo sauce recipe. After the sauce was made, I added a tsp of kosher salt & 1/2 tsp of pepper, a little nutmeg, & a couple shakes of hot sauce... oh, & doubled the minced garlic used because we love garlic in our house! All in all, great recipe proportions to which you can flavor however you prefer.

This sauce is outstanding. It is super creamy. The parmesan cheese does the trick for that wonderful rich taste. I doubled the recipe becasue my family loves when the pasta is drenched in sauce. I will be saving this recipe as my go to pasta sauce recipes becasue it is easy and quick to make but doesnt lack that great creamy taste

I made this for my husband, he rated it against The Olive Garden which he refers to as the "gold standard" for alfredo. I'm sure he would have rated this higher if I had used Half 'N Half but I used 1% milk because that is what we had in the fridge. Because I had to use 1% I used 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese. I also used Garlic lover's garlic seasoning instead of parsley flakes and fresh garlic because I didn't have garlic on hand. Overall 4/5 on my husband's scale is really good! I would have eaten it too if I wasn't allergic to gluten!

WOW!!  I didn't expect this to be this good!  The flavor is mildly garlicky (is that a word?)with a smooth cheesiness (another made up word!).  It thickens enough that you can let it sit a while and add some more liquid before serving.  Like I said, unexpectedly good!!!

This is a great recipe for a quick meal. I used light cream and a litt bit of whipping cream. I cut the garlic in half and used lots of coursely ground pepper instead.

This recipe quick and easy to make, but it tasted like it was missing something - followed it almost to the letter, but I didn't have garlic salt, so I just used more garlic and added extra salt to taste. I'll be making it again, and maybe making some adjustments. Thanks for the quick and easy base recipe!

Family loved this.  I was low on ingredients, so I used 1.5 c half & half, then topped off with milk.  Used parm out of the container instead of grated and garlic powder in lieu of garlic cloves and the family gobbled it up.  I also added a little romano cheese so that I could grate in some kind of cheese that would melt.  Thank you!!!!!!!

This came out great but I had to add a little pasta water to make it thin enough.  I added extra parmesan cheese and left out the parsley.  Thanks for this tasty, quick recipe.

I loved this. It was quite easy. I followed the recipe, except that my sauce thickened up too much, so I put in more cream and then when I ran out of cream, just kept adding milk. 

Also, I covered some chicken pieces with cajun seasoning, fried those, and then threw them in the sauce, which gave the sauce a delicious spicy flavor! Thanks for a great recipe!!

I loved this recipe, it was quick and easy and didn't have weird things that don't belong in a simple alfredo sauce. I substituted the garlic salt with Tony Chachera's and added 1 and a 1/2 tsps of salt and some black pepper. It's a great base and you can always add the flavoring you like!

This is the simplest thing to make - even for a rookie cook like me!  I have made this a few times now, and I have come to omit the garlic salt, but other than that it's a great recipe!

I've been using this recipe since 2011...it turns out best when I make sure the stove temp is never above low-medium/medium, whisk constantly, and allow for a full 4-5 minutes to cook after it begins to simmer. The extra time involved is well worth the effort. My husband says this is restaurant-quality alfredo sauce, and he ought to know!

You really do want to make this sauce last, after the noodles are cooked, otherwise it turns to paste. very tasty and better than  store bought. 
I used Fat Free Half and Half and it was just fine even the next day.

This is super easy. My husband was happy to find out that it was only 1/4 cup butter and 2c cream. His Alfredo sauce has 2 sticks and waaayy more cream and cooks down so much that it makes about the same amount. I didn't have any parsley so I used some dried tarragon instead, added about 1/2tbs minced onion, 1/2tbs nutmeg, 1tsp chili flakes, and 2tsp fresh ground black pepper. Yummy!

This sauce turned out tasting just like something I'd expect at a fancy Italian place. The only downfall was that it tends to get stiff as you let it sit.  I took leftovers for lunch and put some water in the container and it brought the sauce right back to life!  I'll definately be using this recipe again and again.

I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and enough whole milk to make 2 cups. Needed plenty of salt and a little pepper. Next time I may add a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little kick. I made shrimp Alfredo it was delicious, quick, and very easy. I will definetley make this again!!

this was really simple and easy to make. i used pasta seasoning instead of parsley as that is what i had on hand. i paired this with a store-bought butternut squash ravioli : dinner in a snap!

a little bland- it would be better with a little cream cheese melted with the butter in the beginning.

WONDERFUL!! My hubby made this tonight and it turned out just great-and that's with someone who knows NOTHING with making sauces! It was so good our 14-month-old ate it! We did add some cajun seasoning just because we were wanting spicy italian tonight, and we will probably thin the sauce a bit next time but overall I think it was fantastic!

Ate this tonight and it was wonderful!  It was creamy and very versatile.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 9 and had just a smidge left over.  I took about 2 cups of it after I cooked the sauce and put it back on the burner.  Then I added a little cream cheese to it, a little bit more half and half, and some broccoli crowns to it just for some variety and "richen" it up.  It was delicious both ways!  The only thing I think the recipe really needs is a little bit more garlic salt to the recipe...and pepper:)  Other than that, this is a keeper and will be frequenting our table from now on!    Thanks for the great recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe very much ...the consitancy  and the quickness were the best parts...it was a tad bland fo me so i need to figure out what to add to help that but other then that it was delicious. My 3 and 5 year old are chowing down on it w/ some chicken and pasta.

This was easy - a little thick though so next time I would want to work on that. Very quick, easy and good though.

This recipe was SO EASY and even MORE DELICIOUS and very easy to adapt since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I didn't have the garlic cloves, the parmesan cheese or parsley flakes.  I substituted mozzarella cheese for the parmesan and 2% milk for the half and half and it turned out EXCELLENT!  Even though I didn't have those other ingredients it turned out 5 stars good.  Not too thick and not too thin. PERFECT CONSISTENCY.  My husband and son loved it.  We have been wanting a good alfredo sauce recipe for quite a while and I'm so glad I found this one! Can't say enough good things about it. Next time I will double the recipe!

This was so simple yet so good, just for a little twist I added accent salt and a little ginger. I nixed the minced garlic as I am not a fan. Overall this was great and will be added to my list of favorites.

This was so easy and was restaurant quality!  I added diced chicken breast and served with steamed asparagus.  A family pleaser for sure!

This sauce was a hit in my house!  I didn't have any half and half, so I used heavy cream with a bit of whole milk instead, making it much richer.  I also added some fresh green onions from my garden that I had on hand which gave it a pleasant kick.

Quick and easy!  Instead of the parsley and garlic, I mixed in some pesto that I whipped up and the combination is amazing!  Perfectly gourmet for something you can put together in a pinch!
