Just a suggestion to those of you who thought this was too greasy.  I ALWAYS simmer my sausage (kielbasa) for at least a good 30 -40 minutes in water and this takes most of the grease away.  The stock can be used to make split pea soup or any vegetable soup.  Actually I use the stock in cooking my kraut - gives the kraut a bit of a smoky flavor.

I read many reviews before I make a recipe. Usually I stick to the recipe to see what it was meant to taste like unless many reviewers suggest 1 or 2 changes. This was pretty good however I added a few changes of my own. In addition to the pepper, I had green I added a small onion, a few baby carrots and one stalk of celery. I was trying to use up some left over vegetables. I cut everything the same size, all diced. I cooked all the veggies together in just a dash of oil. In a bigger frying pan I cooked the potatoes in a little bit of oil and butter to crisp them up a bit then I added the kielbasa. When the potatoes were almost tender I added the lightly sauteed veggies to the pan. I also added a little bit of beef broth to keep it moist and a few dashes of soy sauce. Put the lid on it and let it cook just a tad more to fully cook the potatoes. The only downfall is there just wasn't enough for 3 hungry adults and 1 child. Next time I will make even more.

This is similar to a meal I've made for years, now. I use light Italian sausage instead of kielbasa. Brown it in a pan. Cut baking potatoes, peppers and red onions into one-inch pieces and put the sausage and veggies in a single layer in a Pyrex dish. Add olive oil, salt & pepper and roast it in the oven for 45 minutes or so. I occasionally add slivers of garlic and/or mushrooms. Really yummy...

Been making this for years! However, I personally coat the potatoes and peppers with olive oil & toss them with some McCormick Montreal Seasoning, a dash of garlic powder and salt.  Put the potatoes (I cut the potatoes into bite size chunks rather than dicing them) on a baking sheet and bake for about 10 minutes @ 375.  Then put the peppers and add some onion on the sheet right after I move the potatoes around, wait another 5 minutes or so and just put the kielbasa on top and cook for another 10 minutes. Doing it in the oven keeps you from having to stand at the stove top for the whole time. Comes out delish!  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!

This is a good recipe that my family enjoyed.  I used frozen peppers.  After reading reviews here I was afraid of mushy potatos so we were careful not to stir the food any more than necessary during cooking.  A couple of pan shakes and fliping the food around during cooking was all it needed.  Was not greasy and the taters were just perfect. It did stick to the pan as other reviews stated but some Dawn Power Dissolve will make cleaning it a snap.  We will make this again since it's an easy week night recipe.

This was very good.  I sauteed fresh garlic, red onion,yellow, orange and red sweet peppers separately then added them to the potato and sausage mixture around 5 minutes before serving.  Very yummy.....I think next time I might add some red pepper flakes for some added zing.  Served with garlic bread and my kids loved it.  Thanks for the post!

Yummy, yummy, yummy.  We could not stop ourselves from having secinds and even thirds.  I used the same ingredients plus onion and used low fat turkey kielbasa.  I also cooked the peppers and onions on the side before adding to the kielbasa and potatoes. DELICIOUS-- a definite keeper.

This recipe was really good and so easy! I followed other suggestions: no oil, added onion,garlic and italian seasoning. I also added green pepper for some added color. The next time I cook this dish I will cook the sausage by itself before adding everything else as there was alot of liquid that I had to drain off before the dish was finished. Thanks for posting this recipe!

It would be better to skin the sausage and cut it in larger chunks. The dish is much too greasy. The sausage needs to be cooked separately and drained well before combining with other ingredients. Otherwise I would have given it more stars.

I prepared this dish in the oven.  I started the potatoes alone on a large baking sheet tossed with salt, pepper and olive oil.  Roasted at 375 for 20 min.  Meanwhile, I simmered the kielbasa for a few minutes on the stovetop, and then sliced it and the peppers.  Finally I tossed everything together, seasoned with pepper, garlic powder and onion powder, and roasted for 20 more minutes.  This worked well for us, and the hubby actually ate his peppers!

Bake It!  I have a large family to feed and it would have taken 3-4 skillets to feed everyone, so I adapted.  I kept the recipe the same, except doubled the meat - used 1 polish kielbasa and 1 smoked sausage that was already cooked.  (Hillshire Farms)  Used my Vidala chopper (cheepy from Bed Bath & Beyond) to make quick work of chopping everything.  Kept the skin on the potatoes and put them in the large baking pan first.  Drizzled with a little oil, sprinkled with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper, then stirred.  Added everything else and stirred again.  Covered with foil and baked at 375 for 30 minutes, stirring once half way through, until potatoes were done but not mushy.  DELISH!!  It did not get greasy at all with the pre-cooked sausage and very little oil was needed because the peppers seeped water and the dish was covered to keep it moist.  This one is also super easy to double or triple to bag and freeze for a quickie dinner later on.  You are chopping anyway, so make another batch or two without adding oil or spices and freeze.  I bet this would also be good as a foil packet for camping. :)  Add mushrooms!  Maybe top with a mexi-cheese blend?

I used a green bell pepper instead of yellow since that was what I had. Slso I added an onion.  The potatoes were done after about 10 min. then they turned to mush.  I made a similar recipe to this years ago, but I boiled the potatoes about 5 min.  then cooked them with the sausage to a crisp.  If I make this again I wouldn't cover the pan.  The potatoes get too mushy.

Delicious! I added some chopped onions and used low fat Polska Kielbasa made by Healthy Choice. I also used less cheese. Other than that I kept the recipe the same. I did need to use the oil since I used the low fat kielbasa. It wasn't greasy in any way. The potatoes soak up the flavor of the juices nicely. I will definitely make this again.

SO GOOD! Tossed the veggies with plenty of garlic powder, salt, pepper and a dash of cayenne. Layered the veggies in the bottom of the skillet with the meat on top so the grease cooked everything, simmered for about 20 minutes with the lid on.  Removed the lid, let everything brown up for about 5 minutes and VOILA! Perfect.  Make sure you cube the veggies to the same size for even cooking.

This dish is great because you can vary it to use up whatever you have. I cook the potatoes with finely chopped onion in oil first. I season with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. (Learned from another similar recipe on this site). Adds great flavor to the potatoes. Then after a few minutes add the sausage. This way, with the sausage having so much grease, I only need to use a small amount of oil when I first cook and onion and potatoes. The grease from the sausage will keep the potatoes cooking without sticking to the pan. Then, because we like our veges a little more crispy, I've added any type of bell pepper, or I've swapped green beans and mushrooms instead, just a few minutes before the potatoes are ready.  Even a can of corn and can of green beans when that was all I had.  Very versatile.

Well, most of the reviews aren't even for this recipe, but something completely different.  Why both reviewing a recipe when you change absolutely everything about it? Submit your own recipe. It's rude to the owner of the recipe to completely change it...then some go even further and give it a bad review when they screwed it up themselves! At any rate...I actually made this recipe, as written, and it was delicious.

Really delicious!  I used 1/3 less fat kielbasa and no one knew the difference!!  Everyone LOVED it!!  Tossed peppers, small onion, garlic and potatoes in the oil with a little salt and pepper.  Through the kielbasa cut into bite size pieces on top of that mixture.  Cover and simmer over medium heat.  It is important to keep it covered until the potatoes soften and all the juices from the keilbasa, peppers, onions and garlic get sucked into the potatoes.  And you don't want to mix it, its more like you want to flip it or toss it because if you mix it your meal will turn to mush!

I have been making this for years! I have a few suggestions to share. I have always used Idaho potatoes because they hold up much better than red. I also throw in a cubed sweet potato.  About 15 minutes before serving, add red onions (1/3 cup chopped), red and green bell peppers (1/2 pepper each), garlic (to taste), pepper & sea salt.  5 minutes before serving, uncover and bump the heat up to medium high turning several times for releasing some of the moisture and crisping up the potatoes.

This was really good!  I also used turkey kielbasa to cut the fat & calories.  It's a great balance of protein, veggies, & starches.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty tasty, great winter comfort food.  I used smoked polish sausage..mmmmmm.  I would recommend first frying up the sausage until halfway cooked, without adding oil.  That will tell you if your sausage is oily enough to add the potatoes without adding any additional oils.

Loved it.  Halved recipe using 8oz of smoked turkey sausage, 1 green bell pepper, 1/2 of an onion, and 4 small red potatoes (sliced into half moon shapes).  A little olive oil in pan, got it hot, then layered the potatoes & sausage slices.  Seasoned, then added bell peppers and onion slices.  Covered, reduced heat to med low, waited 15 minutes, flipped once, covered again for another 10 minutes, then removed lid.  Everything was perfectly cooked, not a bit greasy, and the sausage and potatoes were gorgeously browned.  Served with a small romaine salad and it was heaven.  With a larger salad and some crusty bread, could easily have fed 4. Very comforting!

This is awesome, I make it with whatever color bell peppers I have on hand, one year we even grew the purple variety!  Anyways, the only change I make is the addition of a medium diced onion cooked in with the potatoes.  Yummy!

Excellent!!  Minor changes- don't add any extra oil, kielbasa is fatty enough and I sauted the peppers (added onion) on the side so the kids would eat it too.  Very easy to make and very yummy!

Delicious.  I doubled up on the meat (3 guys in the house) but kept the other ingredients as written.  Added a sliced onion and a little garlic.  We did not think it needed any other spices.  Flavor was wonderful.  The one thing I would change is I think the oil at the beginning is unnecessary.  You get enough fat from the meat that the oil is not needed.  Great recipe.  Thanks

Excellent, flavorful, simple dish. Be careful about overcooking it, because the potatoes can become too mushy.

Great recipe!  The only thing I did different was I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I did sprinkle a little pepper/salt on it after it was done cooking.  I made this last night for dinner and it turned out great.  My husband and I ate all of it.

I made a few changes; only put a green bell pepper, added red onion and some garlic powder sprinkled on top. I also baked it at 425 for one hour.  Had it covered with foil the first 45 mins, then uncovered the next 15 mins.  I did this because any time in the past that I've made it on the stove top.. It doesn't seem like both the kielbasa & potatoes are done simultaneously. Plus it kept me from standing in the kitchen, stirring it.  Came out really good.

This meal was great with a few additions! I cooked the red and yellow bell peppers (1 each), carrots (2), celery (2), and half of a yellow onion in a little bit of oil. In the other pan, I cooked up the potatoes with rosemary and garlic in a little bit of oil and butter. I threw in some corn with the kielbasa (16 ounce) once the potatoes got goin. When the potatoes were nearly to the soft point I added in the vegetables and a little bit of soy sauce before closing the lid to let everything mingle and finish cooking. My girlfriend and I liked it so much that we thought of doin other stuff with the those ingredients and a few others! We tried putting some sour cream and bacon on top and it was AMAZING!!! Could also be premium in a breakfast burrito! Which would be sweet in the case of there being leftovers for the morning, like when you've had a long night or something. That is, if there are any leftovers.

I like to use both butter and oil for flavor and browning.  I season with salt and pepper and will use whatever color peppers I have, oh, and I also add onion.  Try the leftovers as a breakfast skillet by adding egg and cheese, yum!

I've been making a similar dish for 25 years now, and speed things up even more by using canned sliced new potatoes.  I also add quartered onions, and mushrooms the last 5 minutes.  Sometimes a splash of red wine if it is handy. This is a go-to meal in my house, eaten at least three times a month.

I'm not a big fan of kielbasa, but I made this tonight and it was excellent.   My cooking method was slightly different than specified in the recipe.  I roasted the veggies and kielbasa in the oven with some salt and papirika.  I overcooked it somewhat but that to me was the best.  The kielbasa was crispy, and when you bit it, it was like a little explosion of juice, salt and flavor in your mouth.  My husband said I overdid it a little.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I usually avoid kielbasa because it always has a strong greasy taste to me, but this was delicious and my wife loved it also.  This is definitley a keeper if you want a quick, easy dinner that is full of flavor.

This was a big hit in my household, although unhealthy as it is. I did spruce it up with onion and fresh galic. Other than that it was really good. I have had requests for this again.

I liked the combo of flavors in this.  I threw it in the crock pot with about a cup of chix broth, needless to say the whole oil part was skipped, but it came out wonderful.  The addition of red pepper flakes and garlic powder sprinkled over this while serving is fab!  Thanks Malonja!

I took some of the previous suggestions and added onion and several cloves of garlic to this recipe. It was quite good, but the general consensus of my family was that it needed more kielbasa and less potatoes. Next time I will try 1 1/2 lbs kielbasa and cut from 6 to 4 potatoes.

This was simple and great.  I didn't have red potatos so I used regular.  And I also added onion as I coudn't see cooking potatos and sausage without it.  But it turned out great and my 83 year old mother who normally doesn't like anything but traditional southern food loved it.  I'll be using this recipe again! Contrary to other reviews, I thought the bell peppers were a great addition.   Thanks...KR

Simply delicious!  I skipped the oil--didn't need it--and used a frozen pepper stir fry blend with red, green, and yellow peppers with onion, and used red potatoes with the skin on.  I also used Eckrich Skinless Kielbasa, because since I made the fortunate mistake of picking up skinless for a bbq several months ago, my family won't even consider the skinned kielbasa!
A definite keeper in my recipe rotation!

i gave it a five star rating, although next time i'll leave out the peppers. to me and my family, they just didn't quite fit with the rest of it. however, the potatoes really tamed down the sausage, which was wonderful! generally none of us can eat a whole lot of sausage, no matter how it's cooked, because it's too overpowering. i added onion to the recipe though, and that worked out great. it made far more than i thought we could eat, but i was wrong, we ate every bite, minus the peppers which we all pulled to the side of our plates! i will definitely be making this again, probably frequently!

This is one of our go to recipes. It's great as is, but we do tend to switch to red and green peppers since we usually have those on hand.  We have also added cabbage which stretches out the servings a bit.  We also cook the potatoes in the microwave for a little bit to speed up the process.

We loved this, especially with the sweet onion addition.  As others suggested I sautéed the peppers and onion together, sautéed the kielbasa separately, as well as the potatoes.  I was out of fresh potatoes so I browned 1/2 bag of diced hash browns.  Worked perfectly.  Combined all together, S&P, yum.

Substituted a bag of Birds Eye pepper stir fry veggies for the peppers and used white potatoes because I had them.  Yum!  Not one bit leftover.

We really like this recipe.  It is so easy.  Since the Kielbasa has a lot of grease I don't use oil.  We usually substitue mushrooms for one of the peppers and add a little water so we have some sauce for it.  We've also made it with spinach and aspargas too.  Add a little cayanne, garlic salt and Montreal Chicken seasoning!  Yummy

This was fabulous. I have never written a review before but I felt the need to after trying this super simple delicious dish. I used turkey sausage, one red bell, one yellow bell, and some white potatoes and it turned out fabulous! I will say it was a bit oily so next time I think I will not use as much oil. Yall must try this if you have not :)

This was a great recipe concept.
I am a working Mom, so I used frozen pre-diced potatoes(hashbrowns)frozen pepper mix and added corn, and eliminated the oil.  I did cook the kielbasa first before adding the other ingredients.  GREAT, GREAT!

This tasted so so good! I didn't use red and yellow peppers, just green and added an onion to it. I didn't use the oil because the kielbasa makes enough juices. I cooked my peppers and onions with half a teaspoon of butter with minced garlic for like two minutes then I added the meat and potatoes and cooked till potatoes where soft. It came out great, nice and easy way to make kielbasa. Thanks!

What a tasty & easy recipe!  I've made it many times, once or twice as directed, other times adding red onion, shredded green cabbage & I use olive oil in place of veg. oil.  The whole family loves it.

Taste was so so. Didn't care for this much at all. Had to stir constantly to keep from burning.  Just didn't feel like a good dinner at all.

I cooked this according to the directions, and found it to be almost perfect.  I did add about half of a sweet onion, and used regular kielbasa, and the only problem I noted was some of the kielbasa got a little burnt, but none of this dish was greasy at all.  I saved the leftovers to use for an omlet for breakfast.  Yummy!

So Easy and yummy, I will definately be making this one again.  I did modify slightly due to the ingredients I had on hand, had to use regular potatoes instead of red, and green peppers instead of red and yellow.  I also used Healthy Choice turkey kielbasa (I did use the oil called for in the recipe, and didn't think that it was greasy at all)   I did add a little crushed red pepper flakes and a half a diced onion  as other reviewers suggested,  Turned out wonderful!!!   Potatoes had a super yummy flavor.  My boyfriend gobbled it up!  Thanks for the super recipe!!

I made this dish and added 1/2 cup chopped onion.  Instead of frying the potatoes in oil, I cooked them in  watery ham broth. The result was delicious.

I've cooked this meal twice already. I don't have any peppers on hand, so I used an onion instead, it's still tasty. I put the potatoes in first(salt them a little), then put the sausages on top of the potatos so that the juices would seep into the potatos. Will keep making them. Maybe I'll throw in the peppers if I can remember to pick them up.

Very good, basic recipe.  I followed the recipe except using green pepper in place of the red and yellow.  No problems with grease or mushiness.  Want to point out that sausages vary widely in the amount of fat in them, so people should be aware of that and make accommodations while cooking. The smoked polish sausage I got from the deli was pretty lean for sausage, so no greasiness at all and it browned up nice. If I had used one of the top brands in kielbasa, I imagine this would have been much greasier. The pan you cook it in makes a big difference too.  I use cast iron, so a little bit of oil at the start is needed; the person who submitted the original recipe may also have used cast iron. If you use non-stick pan, then you don't need ANY oil.  You have to think through what size to cut the potatoes into and you shouldn't stir very often - that way they brown up nice. If you cut the potatoes too small, and stir too much, you will end up with a mushy mess.

Followed the recommendation of several reviewers to bake it - in my dutch oven.  Added a splash of white wine, lots of herbs (celery salt, chili flakes, garlic, onion, black pepper...) in addition to carrots and a little cabbage.  Did not add any additional oils.  Plenty from the sausage and moisture from cabbage and wine. Baked at 350 for 60 minutes.  Stirred once, added some more herbs.  Perfect and super easy!

This was good.  I will make it again.  I would say it's a good recipe for when you don't have a lot of time.  Also, for me, it takes ingredients I typically have on-hand (we make our own kielbasa so we have a lot in the freezer) so it's also good for those days when you didn't really have time to think about supper ahead of time.

I really enjoyed because I LOVE Polska Kielbasa! Added a carrot cause I had it around, used green onions at the very end, again had to use it up. Started on stove with the potatoes & carrots then added green peppers (on sale). Added garlic powder & oregano. Added the Kielbasa then put in oven for 30 mins. at 350 degrees, used same pan from oven top to stove. I would certainly make again with my own spins!

I listened to other reviewers also.  I used 1.5 lbs of turkey kielbasa and sauteed it with 3 russet potatoes and 3 carrots, peeled and sliced.  In a separate skillet, I added a tbsp. of butter and sauteed a green pepper and a red pepper, cut into chunky pieces,also some chopped onion, 2 stalks of sliced celery, and about 5 cloves of of garlic, sliced.  I added a little salt and pepper and Italian seasoning. I combined the two skillets together for another 5 min., and served it with some left over brown rice with black beans.  It was so tasty.  My daughter is taking a combo of the two dishes to school for lunch tomorrow in a Thermos.  A winner for sure.

I love one dish meals! Made as written but added some onion I wanted to use up, and also some fresh garlic, and a mild cajun seasoning. Didn't quite take the whole 25 minutes, but that's always a good thing. Fiance loved it. Will definitely make again

I wanted to make something quick and simple for dinner tonight and that's how I stumbled across this recipe. I did not have Kielbasa on hand, but I've been known to use smoked sausage as a substitute (and vice versa!) and it never hurts the recipe. I added just a teaspoon of minced garlic for flavor, but other than that and using smoked sausage instead, made no changes to the recipe. The dish is simple, but tastes good enough on its own that you don't even really need to make many changes to it. I will be making it again.

This was so good! I cooked the peppers and onions on the side as others suggested, and added minced garlic and pimientos. I took the "skin" off the kielbasa before adding to the pan and melted american cheese over the whole thing at the end, it really made it a great comfort food dish! This was so fantastic and easy, thank you for sharing!

Really Good!  Made a few substitutions to suit my families tastes.  Cooked potatoes in the oil by themselves for 30 min to crisp them a little, then added Kielbasa.  Added Zataran's Creole seasoning, and garlic powder to liven up the flavor a little...my family loved it!  I will definately make this recipe again.

This is one of my favorite breakfast foods. And I can usually find most of the ingredients on the cheap at my local discount grocery store. I suggest that you make a homemade salsa and scrambled eggs and wrap the mixture up in tortillas with a little cheese and sour cream. Filling, cheap and oh....so....good.

This was really good.  I have never had kielbasa prepared this way before.  I got some fresh home made kielbasa and used that in the recipe and used red green and yellow pepper.  I ended up adding some seasonings at the end (salt, pepper, and paprika)We will definitely have this again.  Oh, and it passed the Toddler Test.

UPDATE: FORGET THE OVEN! PREPARE THIS AS DIRECTED (I.E. STOVETOP) AND YOU WILL BE AMAZED!!! THE SAUSAGE JUICES WILL MAGICALLY CARAMELIZE YOUR POTATOES (AND ONIONS IF YOU ADD THEM) TO YUMMY PERFECTION. :) MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS TO ADD EVERYTHING TO YOUR POT AT ONCE.... IT ONLY TOOK 15 MINUTES FOR MY POTATOES TO COOK THRU AND AT LEAST THAT LONG FOR MY PEPPERS TO CATCH UP. YUM! For a quick, easy & economical meal, this can't be beat!!! Considering I went to my local Italian market to purchase the produce for this (it is waaaay cheaper there), my most expensive splurge was for the sausage. :) Following Erin Kurinsky's lead, I too browned my sausage FIRST, then tossed everything together in a large stoneware baking dish, s&p'd to taste, drizzled with a tiny bit of EVOO and roasted in the oven. My only other change was to add almost an entire red onion (cut into large chunks), three (sliced) garlic cloves and two (each) fresh rosemary / thyme sprigs on top. I covered with aluminum foil and baked in a 425 degree oven for 35 minutes, then uncovered for 5 minutes more. French bread rounded out this scrumptious meal. I can't wait to repurpose leftovers for tomorrow's breakfast skillet! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Slipmaloney! :-)

I make this all the time with kielbasa when there's nothing else to make for dinner.  Instead of using oil, just put the kielbasa in the pan first, it makes it's own grease, then throw in the potatoes and peppers.  I also put in onion and some garlic salt.

I liked this. Added lots of minced onion and garlic, some crushed chillies. Leftovers were excellent with fried eggs the next morning.

several people said that this was greasy - could it be a regional difference with kielbasa?  I know that many people where I live call ALL sausage kielbasa.  I can see why using regular sausage would be an oil issue, but true kielbasa should not produce a lot of oil.  We have made this recipe for decades without any oil issue.  Thank you for sharing!

This was very good but I couldn't help but think it was a little "breakfasty".  It reminds me of a breakfast skillet we get in a restaurant near here.  I think I'll top the leftovers with a couple of eggs in the morning and have it again for breakfast.  

Next time I make this for dinner I'll add onion and garlic and saute the peppers first.

Good recipe..I changed just a few things. For veggies I added onions and sliced cabbage, dash of red pepper flakes a little more Olive Oil.  I added in this order to my large iron fry pan.  Oil, potatoes and browned a little on both sides then added Kielbasa or Smoked Sausage sliced at a long angle for browning then added all other ingredients...cooked everything till meat and potatoes had a nice browned top and bottom...gently turning with heat turned down till all was tender.

This recipie was great, I did saute the peppers and the onions in a seperate pan first with some oil and spices, before I put them in with the potatoes and kielbasa, I also added some water to help cook the potatoes a little faster.

This was good, but I changed the recipe to make it easier and with more veggies. I used O'Brien potatoes (frozen w/peppers & onions), frozen mixed veggies, cut up kielbasa and then added shredded cheddar cheese on top at the end. My family loves it and only takes 15 minutes to make.

Great recipe...although everytime that I have made it, I omit the veg oil and use regular Polska Kielbasa...not lean or anything like that, just the regular one and there's always enough juice from the kielbasa in the pan that adding the veg oil would just make it to oily.  I also add one medium to large onion.  Very good and very easy recipe that I always make.

THIS RECIPE IS TO DIE FOR !!! I USED A NONSTICK POT TO COOK THESE IN. I THINK THE SECRET TO MAKING THESE POTATOES IS TO COOK AT A PRETTY HIGH HEAT, SO THEY DON'T GET SOGGY-- I ALSO LEFT THE SKINS ON. I ONLY USED THE YELLOW AND RED PEPPERS AND IT CAME OUT PERFECT. THANK'S FOR THIS RECIPE.

OH MY GOD!!  What a wonderful recipe.  I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and a touch of Italian seasoning.  My family thought it was so good, there is nothing for leftovers.  Thanks for an easy alternative to my normal kielbasa dinner.

I thought this was good, but it needed some spices.  Once I'd added chopped garlic, s+p and creole seasoning, it was fabulous!  Used 2 green peppers.

I read many reviews and decided to use ideas from a couple of them. I boiled my kielbasa for about 20 minutes to help get rid of some of the fat. I cut the peppers, some onion and potatoes into pieces approximately the same size. I tossed them all in olive oil and seasoned them with Mrs. Dash original seasoning. I put the potatoes on a sheet pan 1st as suggested by one reviewer In the oven at 375 and then added the peppers and onions after about 10 minutes. I browned the kielbasa in a cast iron skillet and added it to the vegetables. Right before the vegetables were done I added some grape tomatoes that needed to be used. It was delicious. There was a small amount leftover which I heated in the microwave and put an over easy egg on top for my lunch today. That was very good too.

The first time I made it I didn’t use a heavy enough skillet and the potatoes and sausage burned a bit. Next time I’ll use cast-iron.  Also keep the heat a little lower and stir more often.

Tended to be very bland even with somewhat spicy kielbasa.  In addition, the amount of oil was too little for properly cooking the small cubed potatoes thoroughly.

This recipe is quite tasty and I like the idea someone else had about adding other vegetables. 
I just wanted to say though, someone suggested to cook kielbasa in water for half an hour previous to cut down on grease. Yes, this will cut down on grease, but it also takes a great deal of the good flavor right out of the sausage. Makes it taste like mushy cardboard. Please, for the love of kielbasa, don't do this. 
If you must, just do a few tablespoons in the bottom of the pan and drain off some of the grease with it.

I love this! I did modify it.. I added cloves of garlic and green peppers. I sautéed the peppers, onions and potatoes each separately in a frying pan on high in a bit of olive oil until a tiny bit of black around the edges, then added each to a baking dish. Then I fried the smoked sausage just long enough to brown and added it also. I baked at 375 for about 30 minutes and it was delicious! It tasted just like I had grilled the veggies!

I got a version of this recipe from a friend over 20 years ago.  Judy called it "Stuff".  I add a medium onion, a zucchini cut into circles about 1/2 inch thick, and 4 medium to large mushrooms (halved).  I have used all kinds of the different flavored chicken sausages to make this dish.  A very versatile recipe.  I make this 2 times a month and hubby and I have leftovers for lunch!

I added butter to cook the potatoes and peppers. I also added some onions. I cooked the kielbasa in a separate pan to crisp it up a little and transferred it to the pan with potatoes, peppers and onions as it browned.

I used the green pepper I had on hand and Johnsonville Smoked Kielbasa.  Yummy starting dish, next time I'll add some onion, garlic and spices.

This recipe was quick which is what I was looking for.  I did make some changes.  (I used a green pepper in place of yellow, added crushed black pepper, lemon pepper and italian seasoning added sliced red onion and finally chopped garlic clove. Tasted wonderful and still healthy.)

I will definitely make this again but with a little twist.  I won't use red potatoes because I don't like how the flavor goes with the sausage.  I also added onion, red pepper and mushrooms.  Next time I will brown the vegetables and sausage first to avoid overcooking potatoes.  If you are able to get to a Polish deli and get some true Polish sausage definitely do so.  It adds so much to the flavor.

Good, basic recipe.  I used some Sun Dried Tomato chicken sausage and added a little onion and garlic to the saute.  I added water or chicken broth to cover the bottom of the pan to keep the potatoes from sticking.

WOW!! So easy to make and so yummy! When I make this again the only thing that I will do differently is cook the Kielbasa in a separate pan so there is less grease. Overall a great meal!

Tasty.  Added red onion and garlic.  Most importantly, I cooked it in the oven in a 13x9 pan as one of the reviewers suggested (maybe the 3rd one down?).  Easy and pleasy.

This was really yummy! I was surprised at how much flavor it had without much seasoning.  I did add some onions, though.  

Wasn't quite sure what to serve with it.  Seemed like it needed something, but nothing seemed right. I opted for biscuits, and that was satisfactory.

I added onions and carrots, and browned with the potatoes (regular kind). 

After cooking with the kielbasa about 15 min. I poured the excess oil into a small fry pan to cook up the peppers separately with garlic. 

Then I added a little red wine and Worcestershire sauce to the main pan and cooked another 5 min. before mixing it all together. Kids and adults loved it.  All veggies were nice and carmelized.  

I can see how you could just roast all of this if there was time. I do a potato/stewed tomato/green bean roast with Italian sausage; just never thought to cook Polish with potatoes like this--silly me!

We liked this recipe very much.  We don't always put potatoes in, and we usually use the "stoplight" pack of peppers (red, yellow, orange).  When I fix it in the slow cooker, I use half kielbasa and half sweet Italian sausage and add zaatar as a seasoning, which works very well.

Easy and tasty-Just perfect when you want comfort food with minimal effort.  I did add onions and boiled the kielbasa first. Oh-and a little chicken broth at the end because I felt it was getting too dry.  It was yummy!

This is so good and so easy!  My six year old devours it.  Someone else recommended giving the pot a shake every few minutes to keep the potatoes from burning/sticking to the bottom of the pan..I highly recommend this.  You definitely don't want to stir it while it's cooking.  Just keep on shakin'...thank you, easy and delicious.

Loved this recipe. We used sweet potato instead of white potato, and we also use turkey sausage to reduce the amount of fat.  FABULOUS!!!

Delightful! I was desperate for a quick supper and used the 'ingredients' option looking for kielbasa peppers and potato since that's what I had on hand. Mine is the lazy cooks version - I used a chunked Hillshire Farms smoked chicken sausage (already cooked) and a cut up baked potato I had leftover from a previous meal, added to the sauteed peppers (I added an onion) sprinkled with Bragg Sprinkle. Since both the sausage and potato were already cooked I just added them to the saute, heated through and served - yummy!

I cooked the kielbasa with yukon gold potatoes- then 10 min before it was done I added red and orange peppers and some onions. 5 min before it was done I added some fresh mushrooms. It turned out great! Only thing is I cut the potatoes too large so it took a little longer to cook. Next time I will cut them smaller but either way it tasted good and was easy to cook. Will make again!

Absolutely delicious! I loved it as did my kids, even my daughter loved it who can be hard to please. My husband said the potatoes can be a little overkill to the flavor, so I added some additional garlic and pepper and it came out great. I will definitely cook it again!

We loved this! I've made this several times and I have requests to make this often. I thinly sliced onions, pre-baked russet potatoes, and kielbasa and placed in a large cast iron skillet and cooked until browned. Then I added sliced red and green peppers and continued cooking until tender. The smell of this cooking reminds me of festival food. I definitely recommend this.

Really, really enjoyed this.  I used turkey kielbasa which does not have as much fat as regular kielbasa so we added a bit of water to help cook the potatoes and kielbasa without sticking to the pan.  Also, we added a bag of fresh spinach for 3 - 4 minutes after the peppers.  Delicious one dish meal and very nutritious!

This was awesome! I used Turkey Kielbasa to lower the calories and fat, and also added a small finely chopped white onion and 2 tblsp minced garlic and it was soooo good. The potatoes were a bit mushy, but I thought that tasted great! Served with french bread, this was easy, fast and tasty!

This was wonderful!  I cut up red potatoes and fried them in EVOO and Italian seasoning.  In a separate pan I put onions, yellow and orange peppers, zucchini, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  Once potatoes were close to being done I added the other pan of ingredients into it and mixed them together.  I boiled the Summer Sausage before cutting it up and adding it to mixture.  I was going to add Apple or pineapple for a sweetness, but figured I would try it that way next time.  I served it with Homemade garlic bread that was:  french bread cut in 3/4 in slices, spread with garlic butter.  In a separate bowl I mixed 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and 1 cup of mayonnaise.  spread on top of garlic butter and broil for  5 minutes.  It is so yummy!

This is a great dish. I do reccommend putting the oil, depending on if you used smoked sausage or the  beef kiebalsa. Kiebalsa is greasier than the smoked sausage. I added sauteed onion,garlic mushrooms, brocolli, and topped with parmesan cheese. MMMM MMMM GOOD! If your adding ingredients add the oil, if not then it also wouldn't be necessary.

My family gave this recipe 5 stars! I cooked russet potatoes part way in the microwave, and used green peppers and onions(was out of red & yellow peppers). I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil. I'll certainly be making this one again! Thanks for sharing.

Used reduced fat kielbasa and sauteed minced garlic, chopped onions and sweet peppers separately then added to kielbasa/potatoes.  Worked out great!  My 10-year-old daughter said, "We'll definitely have to have this again!"  It's only the two of us but if you are making this for four or more I would at least double this recipe!  We only had a very small amount leftover!

Probably would have tated better with better sausage and I cut the sausage too small compared to the potatoes.  They shrank.  I'd try it again though.

This was great. My husband doesn't care for peppers so I just threw together yukon gold potatoes, half an onion, some zucchini and turkey kielbasa. Seasoned with black pepper, italian seasoning and garlic. Yum.

This was incredibly easy and quite good! I added substituted small russet potatoes for the red ones and added 2 tsps. of minced garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes for some added zing.

very good! I made the following changes: I used turkey kielbasa and cut it into larger chunks. I also added a whole yellow onion that I also chopped in large chunks. I cooked the potatoes in the microwave until tender but still slightly firm. I threw all the ingredients into a large cast iron skillet and let it happily sizzle away. I tried to not mess with it too much as to not break the potatoes. When everything had a nice caramalization, I put it all in the oven to finish cooking...which was basically when the potatoes were fork tender. Oh, I also added garlic. It had amazing flavor and I was really happy how it turned out.

This is a really good and simple recipe.  There was one serving left and I think it will be very good for breakfast, that’s if my husband doesn’t have it for his late night snack.

I used smoked sausage because we like it better.  I boiled the potatoes until just tender, then added them to the skillet where I was cooking the peppers and onion.  I boiled the sausage separately also, then added it at the end. I seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I used green, yellow, and orange peppers. It turned out great!  My husband wasn't sure he would like it, but he asked if we could have it every night from now on!!

My Husband couldn't get enough!  It's going in the rotation!  My changes: Spicy Sausage instead of Kielbasa Added an onion Added a sliced head of cabbage with the peppers Added 1/2cup red wine and 1 cup beef broth Might add garlic next time! The broth and wine gave it a nice sauce to keep the potatoes moist and to dip my garlic cheesy bread in!  It was great! Thank you for the recipe!

Not difficult to make and tastes wonderful. I cooked the potatoes for 5 minutes before adding the  turkey kielbasa, then added the peppers for the last 5 minutes of cooking. The sweet peppers go well with the dish.

I agree with most of the other reviews; ONION! Also, added garlic and italian seasoning. I disagree with the grease problem; I like my peppers to have a bit of grease, so I liked that.  I think this recipe is a success IF you add seasonings.

THis was a life saver during a snow storm.  We couldn't go to the store and were snowed in for days.  I went through the freezer and cupboards and this was what we had.  IT is yummy and easy.  My step daughter had three helpings.  It became one of our regular meals. We have taken it on camping trips and prepared it in wrapped in aluminum foil. Very good and very easy!

4 stars for this one.  It was a good idea that needs a little tweaking.  In order to cut down on the time the potatoes needed to cook I put them in the microwave to soften up. Don't forget to poke them with a fork first. :-) Cook these while you are cutting put up the sausage and peppers. Then I cooked the sausage and cut potatoes together until crispy and brown, about 15 min.  I did find that I needed to add a little olive oil to get the browning going.  I then added a clove of minced garlic, salt, pepper and the bell peppers.  I cooked the peppers 15 min or so until softened and slightly browned.  Next time I will saute the peppers before adding to the sausage/potatoe mix to get a better color. I will also add some sesoned salt or some other kind of spices. My HD said it was good but needed a little something extra. With one package of sausage, 8 med. potatoes, and 3 peppers this fed 3 adults and two kids.  Over all a good, quick meal.

My husband thought this was delicious.  It ws quick, easy and very tasty.  The kids weren't overly impressed, and two of them like keilbasa  - that is why I can only give it 4 stars.  We used turkey keilbasa and I added a little cajun spice to spice up the potatoes (instead of salt as the spice is VERY salty).  We will make this again.

I made this dish for our Memorial Day gathering.  I got many compliments.  I too cooked my veggies separately before adding to the pan.    I also added a dusting of garlic salt w/parsley to the potato before cooking. Quick, simple and delicious.

I saved this recipe quite a while back and decided to pull it out and try it tonight.  It was very yummy!  It really hit the spot on a cold snowy winter night!  The only changes I made (out of necessity because I didn't have the called for ingredient) were regular white potatoes (I'm sure the red ones would have made it even better) and green pepper instead of yellow.  I also couldn't resist adding some onion.  I'm sure I'll be pulling this one out again and again.

I'd never heard of this recipe prior to a month ago, and already I've made it twice. The first time I made it exactly as specified. I did have a problem with the potatoes getting mashed a bit, so I turned the heat up to medium-high. From there on it was perfect! I had thought the food a bit too greasy, but I still ate 3 helpings! My two year old also ate plenty!
The second time I made the dish, I decided not to use the oil, as some reviewers suggested. I felt, this time, that it was too dry and had more problems with sticking than the previous time. I did have better success with the potatoes not getting mushy because due to the higher temperature. I thought it needed a dash of salt when serving, but nothing else! This will definitely be a treasured recipe in our home. My only complaint: I eat toooo much of it! No dessert for a week!

Very tasty! I used some chicken sausages I had on hand. I added a sprinkle of garlic powder. I also used a bit of chicken stock while the potatoes and sausages were cooking. Just a few tablespoons, then let it evaporate. It kept the whole dish moist and adds a little flavor. My husband kept saying "this is good, it would be good with a fried egg on top of it". I guess that is how we will try it next time :)

We loved this recipe!  I did add onion and garlic but that is the only change. Delicious!  I used a nonstick skillet and didn't have any problems with the potatos sticking.

Excellent. Very flavorful. I also added one small red onion, two cloves minced garlic, one teaspoon red pepper flakes, and green pepper. Next time I will increase the amount of kielbasa to two pounds.

Excellent dish, the only problem was the potatoes sticking to the bottom of the pan. I added onions to mine and it was very good. Thanks for the recipe.

yum, this is both easy & delicious. i went with the flow & used turkey keilbasa (compare the fat & calorie count with regular keilbasa & you might do the same, yikes!) then added a tad bit more canola oil for coverage. i also sauteed one medium sliced vidalia onion in with the bell peppers. note: this recipe cooks up nice outside on a griddle & propane grill. thanks malonja!

Well - Success!  Need I say more..  I've made this twice so far and my picky eater husband ate and ate..  This is a winner in my family book.  So easy to make.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and vegetable oil, with onion and minced garlic.  I did have a problem with potatoes sticking to the pan, but will use another reviewer's suggestion next time and try a non-stick pan.  I also tried another reviewer's suggestion and used frozen peppers which tasted great.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I would like to say that I do not think you need to add the vegetable oil.  I put the potatoes, Kielbasa and added some onion and covered and there was enough liquid to cook and didn't taste greasy.  I also added a little red wine and some fresh basil.  It is a perfectly good recipe without the additions but I like to try changes now and then.  It is certainly easy and fast and we have had it twice in the past two weeks.

I'm giving this recipe 4 1/2 stars - it was really good, but not quite "The Best."  I did as others suggested and added onion, garlic and red pepper flakes.  It was easy and one that I will remake again soon.

recipe looks interesting. Not everybody knows what kielbasa sausage is, so maybe it could be good to explain it(I found it on the Internet afterwards as I searched.)

This got rave reviews! I made it exactly per recipe, with rice pilaf as a side dish. My husband had a brainstorm: mix together the kielbasa meal with the cooked rice pilaf. It added a little something extra to an already delicious recipe!

I used Emeril's chicken apple sausage instead of kielbasa, and it tasted fabulous.  I will take others' advice to add onions next time, and will probably use all four bell pepper colors (I didn't have green in the fridge, but went with yellow, orange & red, anyway).  Thank you for all the great suggestions--we didn't use oil, either.  Yes,there is plenty from the sausage, alone.  The potatoes absord their flavor nicely & cook to a perfect firmness--not too mushy.

LOVE IT! I have made this about 20 times now. I have used venison kielbasa in place of regular a couple of times ~ still great! There is no need for any other spices or even the oil if you are using a fatty meat. I add two large red peppers, one large green, and two small sweet onions. This is a regular rotation recipe for me. Husband loves it and the veggies are great for you! Will try with turkey kielbasa sometime for an even healthier version than venison.

I used onions and green peppers and cooked them in a seperate frying pan with tb. butter until they were tender. Then threw them ontop of the cooked skinless kielbasa and poatoes, then flip it over and  cooked five extra minutes. It was yummy. Great recipe!

I used smoked turkey sausage sliced to reduce the fat content and added some minced garlic and Italian seasoning as well.  I had no problem with too much juices.  I did have to reduce the heat to medium low after 10 mins.  Wonderful flavor and so easy!

I took one of the reviewers suggestion and baked this in the oven at 400* starting with the potatoes then ten minutes later adding the onions and peppers. Ten minutes later I added the kielbasa, baking for an additional 10 minutes. My husband loved it.

Quick week night meal. Out of preference though I skipped the oil and let the kielbasa create the oil when frying. I let it get nicely browned & then I added some onion & garlic as others suggested. After the onion & garlic fries for a few minutes I put in the diced red potatoes. Make sure you dice small and it doesn't need to cook as long. Finally added my red peppers & had a veggie with it.  Very filling. You don't need salt because the sausage has enough. I may try andouille sausage for a little more kick. Will make again.

Good starting point. Like someone else, I added other veggies that I wanted to use-broccoli & onion as well as sweet red peppers & just three russet potatoes. I diced everything (not broc) small and sprinkled it generously with Montreal steak seasoning.

Added onions, garlic powder, carrots , mushrooms, and celery. Cooked potatoes and onions first. In another skillet cooked carrots and celery. Added mushrooms and yellow pepper to that skillet. Added kielbasa to the potatoes then the vegetable  mixture. Put some vegetable broth in as well. Separated the kielbasa to get it browned nicely and then returned it to the dish. It was excellent! Will definitely make again.

It turned out really good. I didn’t have Kielbasa but did have hot links so used those. Hubby’s not really into potatoes but he too likes the dish.

This is a great recipe that can be adjusted to suit your needs.  I used a package of 5 Hillshire Farms cheddar sausages.  I cut them up and fried them in a small amount of olive oil.  Added them to a glass dish along with the peppers and potatoes.  Added some Italian seasoning, garlic salt, salt and pepper.  Baked in the oven until the potatoes and peppers were tender.  The hubby had seconds and thirds.  We love the recipe.  It's a quick and satisfying meal.  Thanks!

Next time I will brown the kielbasa, set aside, and then add the potatoes to brown in the same pan, adding oil as needed.  They didn't get browned enough when sautéing everything at once. When they are almost done, I'll add the peppers to cook for a while and then I'll add the kielbasa and finish. I will also try adding some sliced onion next time.

Very tasty! I used turkey kielbasa, and I think the extra fat of regular kielbasa would have added a bit more flavor and helped the potatoes brown more evenly.  Next time I will also saute the bell peppers first, set aside, and then add them and heat through at the end.

"It was delicious and very easy to make. it did require some attention while on the range, but I made myself a drink to help whittle the time.  I  added 1/4 cup V-8 for some flavorful liquid.  



















I definitely will make this again, many times.

This was a very tasty dish. I sautéed garlic in olive oil before adding the kielbasa and potatoes, also added Montreal seasoning that was suggested by another poster. I doubled the recipe, because I have two teenage boys. They ate it all, no leftovers. Will be putting this recipe into the rotation.

Perfect but I added things - half an onion, minced garlic and salt and pepper to taste. I also used a green pepper instead of a yellow one. I didn’t dice the sausage, sliced it instead - more aesthetically pleasing, and the illustration showed it sliced, anyway. It was totally scrumptious!

I was really surprised how good this was.  Extremely quick and easy to make.  I added some onion  but otherwise followed the recipe.  Did need a little salt and pepper but adding afterward to your personal taste is recommended.  Definitely will be making this again.

I read some of the reviews and they were very helpful. I ended up cooking peppers and onions separately, browning the potatoes and setting aside. I spiced the potatoes with Lawry’s Seasoning Salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a little oregano. After browning the kielbasa, I added all the other ingredients and warmed a bit. My husband loved it and suggested I add more onions next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Turned out very good.  I seasoned the potatoes with some olive oil, seasoning salt  and S&P in a bag before I put them in the pan with the sausage.  it added additional flavor.  I added some penne pasta when it was all cooked.  Great meal.

I made this for Father's Day lunch for my husband and father in law who are huge kielbasa fans and they LOVED IT! Even my 1 year old and 4 year old ate it, and they eat nothing.  Great recipe!  It will, for sure, become a staple in my house.

I use yellow potatoes instead of red. Since I had green peppers in hand that’s what used. They came out delicious I decided to make this for Father’s Day plus I made eggs over easy plus toast and let’s not forget the Orange juice.

Nice meal. It's a two meal deal for us, my wife and me. I did zip it up a little by using sweet and spicy sausages. We're having a little get together in few weeks, this will be on the menu, along with the capers burgers.

I did, Instead of using red and yellow bell peppers ,I used green peppers and onions.  I  warmed the onion and green bell pepper in the microwave for about 10 minutes in case it didn't get with just putting it in the last 5 minutes. It was delicious,
Thank you!

Loved this dish. I followed suggestions from others and added a small onion and boiled the sausage in beer before cooking.
Tastes even better the next day.

I added potato slices, diced garlic and chopped onions.  I added 1 TBSP of olive oil then sauteed the garlic and onions.  I added the sliced sausage and potatoes stirring occasionally.  with a little over 5 minutes to go I added the chopped red pepper.  Mmmm good!

Skip the pan, wrap in foil torpedoes and throw it on the grill, garlic cloves would be a good addition, we make variations of this weekly.

I added 1/2 medium sweet Vidalia onions sauted with the sausage which I used turkey kielbasa. Peeled the potatoes and sprinkled with garlic powder salt black pepper and added them to sausage and onions cooked until done. Added red peppers and cooked until tender.

I make this a lot.   I cook the kielbasa first then drain on paper  towels.  If you cook them in water first they lose a lot of flavor.  Just fry and drain then add the other ingredients.  If you are using frozen potatoes, I recommend microwaving them first then frying with the sausage.  They will cook faster and more evenly.

Made this with a few changes.  I used cabbage, sliced onions & potatoes.  Added a cube of ice (saw this in a similar recipe) layered
 them in foil & cooked them in the oven.  Easy cleanup. While reading the reviews, I saw others had different ideas to try out.  Maybe I will add fresh green beans the next time. This is a great recipe that can be adapted for your taste.

I have made essentially the same recipe but in a sheet pan. Much easier than cooking in a skillet on top of the stove.

I have made this many times.  It is so easy and so good.  I add onions, broccoli, carrots, and some times cauliflower.  Don't have kielbasa, no problem.  Little smokies, sliced polish, just about any type of round or ring sausage works.  Enjoy!

However I added a can of corn for little more vegetable .

My pre-teens loved it! It was easy to bake.  We used olive oil garlic & onion powder paprika salt n pepper and Adobo seasoning on veggies before mixing in keilbasa. The only thing to reduce time in oven is to partially boil potatoes before adding them to the mixture and putting in oven then cook for 45 min to 1 hr. Or if bbqing use the aluminum foil packet method.

This was easy to make and delicious.  I added sliced onions which added to the taste.  I would cut down on the amount of potatoes next time and cut the pepper slices in half.

This would be great if you like soft squishy flavorless kielbasa and potatoes. If you like it to be a little crispier, I suggest a different recipe.

Surprisingly  good! I wasn't sure If we would like it! But it was delicious and I will surely make again. I made only small changes in the recipe:
a) Used smoked sausage instead of kielbasa
b) Added 1 tablespoon olive oil with salt, pepper, garlic powder, basil, and a shake or two of a pre-made bouquet garni)
c) sautéed potatoes and sausage with 1 tablespoon olive oil, covered, medium heat for 15 minutes,stirring twice
c)Added peppers and 1onion, sliced, during the last 5 minutes of the above
d) Cooked an additional 5-6 minutes

Lovely!

I added 1 sweet onion to the recipe.  I sauteed the onions first and then removed them.  I added them back in after the peppers started to get tender.  My kids liked this dish and it was ready in less than 1 hour.

Following others suggestions, I baked this in a 375* oven, uncovered.  I used unpeeled Russet potatoes, chunked up and mixed with the oil, some McCormick Monterey seasoning, and baked 10 minutes.  Then added chunked peppers and onions, tossed and baked another 10 minutes.  Then added precooked roll sausage, sliced, tossed again and baked another 10 to 15 minutes.  Delicious, not greasy at all.  The leftovers were great the next morning warmed in a skillet and then gently adding unbeaten eggs, seasoned, and covered till done.  Will definitely make again and again!

I added onions and a few extra spices  to the basic recipe and baked it in the oven instead of cooking on the stove top, and it turned out great!!  My family is asking when we can make it again, and I can’t give any leftover ideas because there was none left!

Having all the ingredients on hand I decided to give this a try. I made the dish as written with one exception, I add onions. It was super easy and quick to prepare and was a huge hit with the whole family. I will be making this again.

To make diabetic friendly I used sunchokes in place of potato's, then used a nitrate free chicken sausage. The taste was great. I convert nearly all recipes I find now to organic ingredients.

Next time I will try using a non-stick pan or at least turning the potatoes less as they got a little mushy. Also added pepper, salt, and garlic - not sure why the recipe has no seasoning. Maybe like Kenny's mom, they don't know how to use spices?

This is a very good, quick and easy recipe.  The husband really liked it, but we both agree, it would be much improved by the addition of some onions.

used golden potatoes since that is all I had on hand.  Added some onion and green bell pepper for flavor and also used chicken smoked sausage to lower the fat content.  Followed some of the other reviewers advice as far as cooking goes, as well.  Used two pans, cooked the peppers, onion with a little bit of olive oil in one.  Put a pat of butter in the other pan and browned the potatoes.  While those were cooking, sliced up the sausage, waited for the potatoes to start to feel almost cooked thru and added the sausage to the skillet.  browned the sausage before added the rest of the veggies to the skillet.  After dishing this up, I decided to sprinkle a little shredded mexican cheese blend on top (just a tiny amount for flavor).  This was pretty tasty and if you added some scrambled eggs, it would make a very hearty breakfast skillet as well!

I make this all the time.  It is easy, delicious and filling.  I use frozen potatoes O'Brien.  So easy.  Be sure you get a good quality kiebasa and you will be hooked.

This was pretty good! My only advice is to cook the peppers and onions separately because they release water which make the potatoes kind of mushy. Otherwise good and quick recipe!

4 stars is generous, but 3 stars isn't enough. This recipe was ok. It was a good way to use the kielbasa that was hanging out in my fridge. Hubby and I ate it with no complaints, but the leftovers didn't get touched and no one went back for seconds.

I have been making this for years. I make a little different. I always add onion and use lots of black pepper. I use whatever color peppers I have (mostly green) and whatever kind of potatoes I have on hand. I simmer the kielbasa in water, brown it, then slice it. I don't add oil, I use the drippings from the kielbasa. It's a fast meal. I have also added sauerkraut and apples, leaving out the peppers.

This was very tasty. After cooking the kielbasa and potatoes I left it to drain in a colander while I deglazed the pan with about a 1/4 cup of white wine. Added everything into the pan (kielbasa, potatoes, peppers) and cooked another 10 minutes.

This is a tasty, easy to make weeknight meal. I followed the recipe, and added seasoning salt to the potatoes. It turned out quite greasy. Next time, I will cook the sausage separately, and add everything together in a serving bowl. All 3 kids ate it, so it's a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I made this today, well a version anyway. I cut the potatoes in 1 inch pieces & cooked in a cast iron pot for 15 minutes covered with olive oil, fresh thyme s&p. Cut the sausage in coins & cooked in a separate pan till light brown.Cut these in 1 inch pieces too. Cooked peppers & onions in the broiler with olive oil, s&p garlic & thyme.  Mixed all together in original pot with poates for few minutes covered. It's different but very good. Would make again.

When I saw this recipe I thought why not skewer the kielbasa with peppers and add some onion and do some grilling. I served my dish with Potato Pierogi. I did glaze the kabobs with an oil and garlic mixture while grilling.

I made this when visiting my parents as they had a kielbasa in their fridge. It's a delicious recipe, but I did make a few changes. I wanted to up the vegetable content, so I roasted some diced carrots with the potatoes in the oven. I fried up the kielbasa in a skillet and used the grease left over to cook the peppers, and at the end added a bag of baby spinach and covered with the heat off to let wilt. In addition, the seasoning isn't very diverse, so I added a blend to the potatoes when roasting. It's a delicious base recipe that you can tweak to your own liking. I'm making it again at home tonight!

We loved this! Didn't have any peppers so just did the kielbasa with potatoes and onions. I sauteed the kielbasa first, in just a bit of oil and butter. Removed and cooked the potatoes and onions together. When they had a nice crisp on them I threw the kielbasa in and let it all marry for a bit. Threw an over-easy egg on top of each dish when served and wow! Was darn good, and cheap!

This has become a favorite in my household.  Whenever i see kielbasa on sale, this is on the menu.  I leave off the green peppers because apparently i'm the only sane person in the household that likes them in this dish, but otherwise it's cooked exactly as it is in the recipe.  Deliciousness.

Kids love it!  Even the peppers!  I added a medium onion with the potatoes. Also,  2 tablespoons of vinegar adds a little zip to the dish (also add with the potatoes).

Needs extra liquid. My kielbasa was burning early on so I added 1/3 cup water & kept covered. It needed another 1/3 cup ten minutes later. Other than that it was good, and my picky kid even ate the peppers (ketchup helped). I used 1 pepper and 1 small onion.

Followed recipe exactly. I'm new to kielbasa and was expecting the flavor to rub off on potatoes a little bit but it didn't so I think I will add seasoning to them next time. Thanks for recipe!!

I've actually never cooked kielbasa before so I followed the suggestions and boiled it first. Most of the grease is gone with just enough for flavor. I sauteed the potatoes first in olive oil until nearly done, removed them from the pan and then sauteed red pepper, onion. I then sauteed the  kielbasa in a clean pan and added a little teri sauce and garlic. Threw everything together and heated it up which was just enough to finish off the potatoes. It turned out fantastic! I gave it four stars only because I always tweak my recipes a bit.

I decided to use just green and red  peppers and onion (that's  what I had ) . I added minced garlic ,crushed red peppers  and chicken sausage  I opted for the Oven to avoid mushiness then added the other ingredients when potatoes were to my liking.  Over all this was a great meal !!! I'm excited about switching it up next time!! Yummy!!!!!

Great easy recipe. I added green peppers and jalapeños along with some seasoning (pepper, garlic, sea salt). Tasted great! Next time I might cook the potatoes separately a little first, they did get a bit mushy in the skillet at the end.

This is a great one meal dish! I added onions only because I was short a pepper. You could use any veggies you would sauté.  It was delish and would make again. All made in one pan makes it easy.

Good taste, easy to make, and best of all, easy on the wallet. Broke college student approved. For sure will be making it again and will probably add some different ingredients like zucchini or asparagus to change it up a little.

Good, quick meal.  I omitted the oil since kielbasa has plenty of that by itself and added onion.

Five stars not only for taste but for how fast and easy. Made this as a quick throw together one night for my family of seven. Was a hit with everyone, except the youngest. Although once she picked out the peppers, she was quite happy. Will definitely be making this again. May add some fresh sliced mushrooms next time.

The changes I made were, I added fresh mushrooms, instead of all white potatoes I had half of them sweet potatoes and I added a head of cut up cabbage.  For spices, I  used quite a bit of sage and some thyme.  I would make it again.

Fast and easy and yummy.  I used Chipotle sausage (the kind that comes in one long one lb. link) for extra kick and 2 medium yams instead of red potatoes and if I have one, I slice up an onion. You really cant go wrong here.

Made this dish because it looked easy and yummy... only thing I did different was to cube and boil the potatoes before putting them in the skillet and used real butter versus veggie oil...
It was the FIRST time my stepdaughter ever said "thank you for dinner it was awesome!" :-)
That's the best review you can get in my book. Thanks for saving the night!

I loved this!  Very simple to prepare so it will soon be a regular in our home.  The only thing I added was a half a chopped onion because others had recommended it and about a half to a teaspoon of salt for a little seasoning.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Tasted great! Family loved it. I threw in 1/2 onion. The potatoes came out mushy so next time I won't cover them. I'd also use less oil. It did turn out slightly greasy. I would definatley make this again! I grated some cheddar and it was great. It would also be good to add some tabasco or cholula hot sauce. Simple and fast!

I use turkey kielbasa, seems to be less greasy. I also use the frozen bag of diced peppers and onions, less expensive than buying fresh peppers and also makes for a quick meal. This is perfect with a salad and some crusty bread.

This dish is super easy and delicious. I usually add a little garlic and onion for additional flavor. Turkey kielbasa also works well if you want to make it a little healthier.

This was very good.  I added several different color peppers, mushrooms and onions to use them up.  I didn't have problems with it being too greasy, as some have said.  Perhaps that is because I used turkey sausage instead of real kielbasa.  In fact, I would say the substitution made it not greasy enough.  I stirred them frequently, and every stirring scraped the crispy bits off the potatoes and left them in the pan.  Next time I will try either more oil, real kielbasa or cooking it in the oven as others have suggested.

If you or your significant other is the "meat-and-potatoes" type, then this will be a winner.  For me, it was acceptable, but slightly bland.  I proceeded as is with the recipe, only adding some red peppers flakes to add a bit of depth and contrast.

As written I believe the recipe is a little bland.  I added some black pepper (i used a generous amount from a shaker) and some red pepper flakes to zip it up a little.  The kielbasa and potatoes had great flavor but the peppers were still bland to me.  Once we figure out the spices we want to add to this dish, it will be 5 stars.  Overall a good simple and easy to prepare meal.  We're having this again.

Everyone loved this.  I added cumin, black pepper and a vidalia onion just due to personal preference.  Word to the wise though, my large frying pan was overcrowded and some of my sausage pieces got a little overdone.

I changed this by adding regular peeled potatoes,(no red on hand) a generous amount of smoked paprika, garlic powder, and italian seasoning and a bit of pepper.  I also boiled the sausage to take some of the fat out and then fried it with green peppers and onion. I used a cast iron skillet with some veg. oil and added the potatoes. After the potatoes cooked, I added the sausage mixture. The taste was very good, the texture, not so much. My potatoes were mushy not crisp. I have never made fried potatoes but I'm thinking next time I won't put the lid on and maybe that will help.

We liked this recipe.  I made some minor changes.  I cooked venison hot sausage and small-chunk potatoes in oil in a skillet.  In a saucepan, I cooked in chicken broth the thinly-sliced peppers and onions.  Then I added these to the skillet along with some leftover green beans.  Lastly I sprinkled some cayenne pepper for flavor.  I like that this is a versatile recipe by varying the meat and veggies.  DH and I say "This is a keeper".  Thanks for sharing.

Loved this!!!  I don't actually like eating peppers, but I love how much flavor they add to a dish.  I used a turkey kielbasa to cut back on fat and regular potatoes that I peeled.  I also threw in half a green pepper that was going to be thrown out soon.  All of the flavors just come together so well, and I love the slight crispiness on the sausage and potatoes.  Overall, an easy, quick, delicious weeknight meal.

I found this recipe on here about 4 years ago and this has become a regular on our dinner menu! My husband absolutely loves it and requests it on a regular basis. He tells me that you can't go wrong with a dish that is basically meat and potatoes! lol!  The only thing I do differently is I use beef sausage and remove the skin, as well as omit oil as the sausage adds it's own oil. I also mix it up with using a variety of different colored peppers each time I make it and add onions and a tablespoon of minced garlic. You can also season it to taste- I sometimes add a little cajun seasoning which is my hubby's fave! I did give it 4 stars however, because the potatoes seem to cook a little too quickly on the outside which sometimes leave them a little too crispy...  Overall a great, simple,tasty recipe!

We really enjoyed this. I love the simplicity of it. I sauteed the peppers separately and also added  onions. I added them to the potatoes and kielbasa just at the end. We also used turkey kielbasa. I sprinkled the final product with Italian Seasoning. We will make this again.

I think I would use a cup of beer to simmer my sausage in and skip the oil.  You will cook out enough oil just from the sausage itself.  I think I would add an onion as well.  You can't go wrong with this combination !!  Happy first day of Fall !!!

Hubby said it was the best "skillet" i've ever made!Used Turkey Kielbasa, definitely had to add seasoning with salt & pepper, plus garlic and some green onion. Ate the leftovers for breakfast, just added some scrambled eggs, sour cream, fresh avacado. Bammm!

I made this into a soup and it turned out great!  I used celery, garlic, green and red peppers, onion and red potatos along with the kielbasa.  I browned the kielbasa before adding to the soup and added potatos at the end to prevent them from getting mushy.  Also added thyme, basil, hot sauce and pepper for some spice.  Very tasty and will make it again!

Soooo tasty!!!  I never knew I liked kielbasa so much.  I added an onion to this (I think it would be bland without) and also, didn't have regular potatoes so I used sweet potatoes (yams) and wasn't sure how it would turn out but it may have been even better this way.  Nice sweet carmelization as a counterpoint to the smoky, salty meat.

Made this for breakfast.Very simple and tasty. This goes very well along side scrambled eggs and toast. I cooked my kielbasa seperatley so my dish wouldnt be so greasy. I also added red onions to it. Will make again.

I have been making this for years and it's wonderful! I also add onions to the mix for a little extra flavor. This is one of those recipes that is good when you need comfort food or just when you can't think of anything else to make for dinner. This is a great simple and inexpensive meal...WE LOVE IT! :)

This was excellent. I cooked the onions, red and green peppers and mushrooms seperately to get them caramalized. Then I added them to the top of the kielbasa and potato on each plate. I used turkey kielbasa, didn't add any oil and only used a little (1T) oil in the onion/pepper mix.  Easy to make this dish low-fat. Add more veggies, use less oil. With the caramalized onions and peppers, we felt like we were eating a sausage, onion and pepper sub! Will make again. Only took 20 minutes including prep.

i really liked this one. i dont think the oil is necessary though. the sausage  has enough juices. i used spicy sausage for the men in the house. they loved it. OH, it needed a lot of salt though.

This was super easy and really good. I used red, yellow and green peppers and added a small onion. It did get a little greasy but I think that was part my fault, I added too much olive oil. Will make this for a quick easy weeknight meal. Thanks!!!!!!!

To be honest I didn't really care for this.  We make a very similar dish but using Italian sausages, and its so good.  The Kielbasa just didn't match up with the other flavors quite right. Great idea, just needs a different sausage :)

I have been eating this since I was very little- had no idea it was a recipe! Yes, I've noticed some people mention how greasy it can be... but it's supposed to be! That's the best part! You have to expect that there is no gettin around it when you cook with kielbasa. So delicious, full of flavor, easy, filling, ingredients can be added with ease- a GREAT dish for anyone!

My husband loved this!  I used russet potatoes and turkey kielbasa.  I think reds and regular kielbasa would have been better but a bunch more calories!  I also added coarsly chopped onion.  Sure was easy!

This was such a nice way to change it up for kielbasa. I thought it was strange it didn't call for salt or pepper! I can't imagine not using at least salt for all those potatoes. I also added some fresh thyme and it was really flavorful. Next time I think I will add some pineapple as well for some sweetness.

Yummy!  Great flavor from the kielbasa.  The potatoes just soaked it up.  I didn't use vegetable oil, just let the kielbasa do its thing, and it turned out wonderfully.

Extremely good!  I tend to like to make all kinds of different recipes, rarely repeating but this one has become one of the few staple dinners in my household.  Hubby LOVES this meal.  I add some coursely chopped onion, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, basil and maybe a TBSP or two of A1 steak sauce.  I know the A1 sounds odd but it really makes the dish.

Delicious! Used turkey kielbasa instead, definitly saved on the fat and had no problem with grease either. Used olive oil instead of veg. oil, added onion and fresh garlic when sauteing potatoes and kielbasa. Potatoes a little mushy but tastey!

This recipe was really yummy, it was a nice change from the typical kielbasa and saurkraut.   I grilled the keilbasa on the bbq first to cook it.  I bought fresh kielbasa so it wasn't cooked.  I sliced it when it came off the grill. Also, I added about 3 sliced carrots, 1 diced onion, and 3 garlic cloves minced.  Make sure to have a very large frying pan so that the potatoes brown evenly. This was really good, I will definitely make this again.

I really liked this. I steamed some red potatoes in the microwave and while they were cooking, I cooked some peppers and onions in some butter. Took them out, and browned my kielbasa. Took that out, and browned my potatoes and added everything back together. I thought the potatoes were perfectly creamy but crisp from being browned. DELISH!

Yummy.  I did not dice the Potatoes or kielbasa, I just sliced them to 1/4" pieces.  I did not have any peppers, so I added onions for the last five minutes.  My husband loved it, said it reminded him of a smoky campfire hash.  this would be great for breakfast too.  I would double the recipie for a fam of four.....we had no leftovers between two adults and a toddler (toddler only eats a very little!)

I thought it was a little dry. It could have used some onions and maybe a gravy. Other than that it was good.

With the recommended oil, it came out too greasy.  Also, my husband and I thought the dish was rather bland.  If I made it again, I wouldn't follow the recipe.  Instead, I'd omit the oil and kick it up with some spices or use spicy sausage.

This is so simple and a very satisfying meal.  I do, as other reviewers also stated, sautee the sliced sausage before adding the rest of the ingredients.

Very good. I sauteed the veggies (plus onions) seasoned with garlic salt and pepper first, and browned the sausage separately. Then put everything together to finish cooking. Too much stuff to get nice and brown in a pan at the same time.

delicious, I used chunks of potatoes kielbasa and peppers... sauted the potatoes firstin olive oil and added thyme and grill seasoning.. then added chicken broth to potatoes .. after a few minutes added the peppers and kielbasa and cooked on low til potatoes were fork tender... adding more broth to keep moist and from burningand drying out. also gave something to sop up with bread.. mmmmmmmmmm                            made this again for  a meal at my local bingo... cut everything bite size and used red onions and some carrots I had left over . also added mushrooms.. made alot  so I also used stock and made it a soup.. brought only one  bowl home from making a big stock pot half full it was that good. added steak seasoning and other spices. yummo

This is pretty good stuff.  I cooked the pepper and onion separately, and just added it to the potatoes and sausage when the potatoes were done.  I think next time I will add a couple cloves of garlic to cook with the onion and peppers.

I didn't think it would be that good when I first read it, but it really was! I did make a few changes, which you really should try. First, I cubed up some potatos and heat those up first in just a little EVOO, then I added chunks of green and red pepper and sliced onion and the sliced up kielbasa and partially covered. Then, I seasoned with garlic powder and pepper, a little salt and paprika. Then I sprinkled some worshtershire sauce over it and stir fryed a bit longer until the potatos were tender. OMG! The flavor was out of this world. Thank you for sharing!

I was a bit hesitant to make this at first, but I liked all the ingredients so how could it be bad... it was great! It reminded me of a hash almost, very comforting on a cold winter day.

This was great. I doubled the meat and skipped the oil. Was good for dinner, but we enjoyed it more as a breakfast dish. Was pretty easy and flavorful. We served it with hot sauce.

I love kielbasa, so I really wanted to like this recipe. This was just okay. I'm not sure why others rated this so highly, but I think it's because they added additional vegetables and seasoning. It definitely needs onion.

I like this recipe a lot.  I did however change it a bit.  I cut up the kielbasa and used 1 green pepper, 1 onion, 1/2 lb diced mushrooms, and 6 yukon gold potatoes.  I suated the pepper, onion, mushrooms, and kielbasa until the onion was nice and brown and the peppers and mushrooms were a bit soft.  I mixed this was the diced potatoes in a baking dish and baked at 400 degrees covered with tinfoil for 45 minutes.  I then removed then tinfoil covered with cheese and baked uncovered for 15 more minutes to melt the cheese.  The family took it down and it was very tasty.  Mine did come out a bit oily even using reduced fat kielbasa.  If you don't like this I would suggest cooking the kielbasa first and removing the fat the comes out of it.  Of course use salt and pepper to taste.

I made this and it was delicious.  I used turkey kielbasa, sliced and cut in half. I added 3 diced bliss red potatos, a diced onion, diced fennel and sliced portabello mushroom.  I only used salt and pepper for seasoning.   It all was cooked in a covered skillet for no more than 25 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.

Didn't change the recipe at all.  Easy and yummy, my family liked it!  Potatoes were very soft and getting mushy, but my husband said he liked them like that.  We added season salt and pepper to our portions.  Will make it again.

Hearty, wholesome, and spicy. I boiled the potatoes before tossing them in with sauteed sausage and veggies (peppers, onion, celery). Also added chopped garlic and several dashes of worcester sauce.

My husband made this for dinner tonight and it was SO good!  He cooked the kielbasa and potatoes separately and added seasoning salt to the potatoes.  He also used green peppers instead of red.  Very good dish...it will be added to our food rotation.

I totally forgot to review this recipe. It was one of our favorite winter comfort foods. This was so fast, easy, and tasty. Added some cajun seasoning and a whole onion and I added some bar b que sauce to my bowl.

A tasty meal after you tweak it just a bit! I started out skipping the oil, and cooking the kielbasa and potatoes for about 20 minutes on medium heat. Then on medium high heat for five minutes, browning everything up. I added a splash of Corona to deglaze the pan and then added the peppers. I also added onions, portobello mushrooms and a few shakes of red pepper flakes. Cooked everything until the peppers were tender and then served them with a liberal amount of salt. My husband was raised a vegetarian and never touched meat until he was 21, this was his first encounter with kielbasa and he absolutely loved it!!! We will make this again for sure!

I used italian sausage, and sauteed the peppers separately at the end, and this turned out very well.  I cooked the sausage and potato together in a cast-iron skillet and didn't find it too greasy at all, the sausage gives the potatoes a great flavour.  Only complaint is both times I've made this, the potato goes too mushy.  Will try parboiling them next time.

We just finished eating this.  For a meal done in 15 minutes, it can't be beat!  I used a bag of frozen peppers and onions, since that is what I had on hand.  I just made sure it was thawed and drained before adding to the potato/sausage in the frying pan. I did not peel my potatoes.  Added a little red pepper flakes and garlic pepper (as well as salt).  My whole family really enjoyed this!   I give it 5 stars for ease of prep, and 4 stars for taste.

This was really great. I am sure the basic recipe is great, but I used suggestions from other reviewers. I boiled out the grease from the kielbasa before using it so it wasn't as heavy. I also sauteed the peppers in garlic, fresh ground pepper & onion prior to using it in the recipe. I added a bit of ground cayenne red pepper into the whole mix for a little kick. Even my kids enjoyed it! Thanks for a great recipe.

Hubby gave it 4 1/2 stars because I don't care for kielbasa. He loved it.

I also let the potatoes (I used yellow)and kielbasa cook for a few minutes and dumped in the peppers and added garlic powder, salt, pepper, onion and red pepper flakes and served it with a side of sauerkraut.

He wants me to make it again!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe as written, however I did used canned, diced potatoes for convenience. Next time, I think I'll add some red pepper flakes and minced garlic. This is a keeper, thank you!

This is a new staple in our house.  It is inexpensive, easy to prepare and full of flavor. I cook mine on low heat and stir sparingly to keep the potatoes in tact.

Oh, is this ever good! I just made it and am in fact having a little of it now -- needed something to make for supper that was quick and used what I had on hand.  I had a kielbasa that was approaching its "Sell By" date and so I made this. It's wonderful and flavorful and not so loaded with ingredients that each item's individual taste can't shine through. Quick, too, which is a definite plus. The only reason I gave it a "4" rather than "5" is that I knew looking at it that I would need to add a little fresh garlic and onion and kosher salt. I think I would definitely miss those things if they weren't in there. I'll make this again.

This will probably become a staple at our house. It's easy and flavorful. I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and a sprinkle of onion powder. Chopped onion would be good in it, too.

Really enjoyed this meal.  I cooked the pepper (with 1/2 an onion and some garlic) in a separate pan.  Then I put the potatoes and meat into the pepper pan for the last five minutes-- that way I left some of the meat grease behind.

This was surprisingly very good. I was skeptical at first. I had a package of mozarella and artichoke gourmet sausages I had to use and found this recipe. Although it doesnt need the oil (came out a bit greasy) it was very good. Seasoned with seasoning salt and paprika. Delicious!

This is soooo good.  I used beef kielbasa, green pepper, and russet potatoes (that's all I had) and added onion; it was delicious.  The only reason I didn't give out 5 stars is that the recipe is really greasy.  Next time I will do as another reviewer suggested and boil the kielbasa and potatoes first.

This is a very quick, easy and delicious recipe.  I added onion, seasoned salt, pepper and garlic to the mix - a must do in my mind - the potatos turned mushy, but we didn't care.  This dish is surprisingly good and I'll make in again for sure!

Good, but you definitely need to add a lot to it for some good flavor.  Almost felt like it needed some sort of sauce because it was quite dry.  I think it would be awesome as a breakfast food, maybe with eggs.

I added a lot of spices to this to make it good - pepper, salt, garlic, cayenne. And it's difficult to cook the potatoes without them becoming mushy. It would be good, hearty campfire food.

I expected to like this a lot more than I did.  Maybe I did something wrong but I had a difficult time not smashing my potatoes whenever I mixed the potato/sausage mixture while cooking.  When done, I found there wasn't enough flavor (and we're not huge spice-people).  I had already added onion and garlic as others had suggested, but also had to add garlic powder and seasoned salt.  Again, maybe I did something wrong since so many others likes it but I won't be making it again.

Used frozen red & yellow bell peppers. Felt it could of used just a tad bit more sausage. Cooking time was off. Needed to cook longer than recipe called for but that’s probably just because of my stove top. Served with Mardi Gras rice (sorry not on this site).

The flavor was good, and all family members ate it, but you really have to babysit and stir quite often, even with a non-stick pan.

It is a good basic recipe.  I had to jazz it up a little.  I added a large onion and some spices.  Family seemed to like it, I will probably make this again.

My husband introduced me to kielbasa-I did not like it. Well he just wasn't preparing right because this was AWESOME. I also added onions and topped off my own serving with pepper juice. DELICIOUS!!!! I can't wait to have this meal again, especially since the kids ate it(with the peppers&onions picked out of course--kids)!

this was too bland for us, so I added about 1/4 chopped onion and a pinch of garlic powder.  i also added a pinch of crushed red pepper to give it some more of a kick.  very tasty!

I made this recipe but substituted the red potatoes with the frozen o'brien hashbrowns, they already have peppers and onions in them, i also added more peppers and onions, i also sauted garlic pieces in with the oil and added more spices to my liking. The potatoes got a bit mushy, but it was still very tasty, i loved it!

I made this but added onions too(based on the S.O.P.P recipe alson on this site) and while it was good, it needs more seasoning as others have mentioned.  Not bad though....

Pretty good, although I think I will add a red onion next time and will try a leaner kielbasa, maybe turkey.

Very good but missing something.  I almost feel like adding a little marinara sauce and red wine and subbing Italian sausage for the smoked kielbasa.

Excellent! I chopped up a half of an onion and added it to the recipe. My kids didn't know what they were eating but they said, "Whatever it is, sure does taste good!"

Great dish. My wife and I had this for dinner but thought it would be good with breakfast as well.
