I also make this every summer for my boys. Just as my Grandma did for us kids. This also works with frozen berries. Depending on how sweet your berries and if you use NF plain yogurt, you may not need the extra sugar at all. NOTE: If you don't keep paper cups on hand all the time, you can save your Snack Pack cups, fruit cups or yogurt cups from previous meals and re-use them for the cups for your pops. Better for the environment and you can use them again and again. Also, if you've got issues with finding a flat surface in your freezer to keep these from tipping and spilling, place them on a baking sheet or flat plate before sticking them in the freezer.

Perfect, just what I was looking for!  I would probably omit the sugar if your strawberries are really sweet--mine were!  Otherwise, I bet Splenda might do the trick with less calories.

Excellent!  My 3 children love this recipe.  What a great way to get fruit and yogurt into picky eaters!  We make it with whatever fruit/berries we have on hand - often just strawberries, or strawberries and bananas.  I use a little honey to sweeten the mix instead of white sugar.  The recipe makes more than our popcicle mold will hold and the kids love to drink the extra as a smoothie!

I"m a home day care provider and I made this for the kids every hot day for after school snack.  They know, if is a hot day, they going to have ice pops. I made it with a deferent fruit every time (today banana and strawberry) and they love it.  And is an approve healthy food by the state.  I just add more sugar and a tbs of vanilla extract.

Fairly simple to make.  Didn't have any "formed" popsicle holders, so I used small dixie cups and wooden popsicle sticks.  Kids LOVED them!  I made strawberry and raspberry.

I made these using frozen strawberries, pineapple and mango.  I froze them in some Jello-O egg-shaped molds for Easter.  My boys loved them!  Actually, so did their dad and I.  Thanks for the recipe, april- we'll definitely be making these again!

I love to serve my kids healthy pops.  They think it's a treat, I'm happy they're eating fruit and yogurt.  I leave the sugar out, and use whatever fruit we're in the mood for. The kids favorite is MANGO!

I used up frozen strawberries from our garden mixed with bananas and these were great! I will make these again, I used silicone cupcake cups and it worked just fine. Thanks for the recipe.

The flavor is really great.  In fact, my husband had the extra as a breakfast smoothie. I used bananas, strawberries, and blueberries.  The texture was a little icy, not smooth, but I may have added too much fruit.

These are very tasty. I used 1% vanilla yogurt and they were quite creamy. We were looking for something a little more 'ice pop' like so maybe 0% yogurt is the way to go for that effect. I used black bananas pureed in with the other fruit which necessitated only using about 1 tbs sugar. I always keep over ripe banans on hand in the freezer as they add great natural sweetness to smoothies and things like this. Thanks for the recipe!

These are great.  I am only giving 4 stars, because the raspberry seeds should be removed prior.  They made the pops very crunchy.  But this is a great recipe!

I made this into a smoothie that my 1 year old gobbled up. Instead of fresh berries, I used frozen ones and just placed it all in the blender. I didn't add the sugar, as I find that bananas are plenty sweet for our tastes. This is the first healthy snack I've found that my son doesn't just play with (i.e. throw on the floor, fling on the walls, or smear in his hair). I think it will become a regular snack-time treat!

For all of those who are looking for a low/no cal version, omit the banana and use a zero calorie sweetener such as Splenda. This will save you about 57 calories with the total just around 27 calories per severing.   Omit the yogurt and you will have a zero calories sweet treat.  (water may be needed to make a pourable mix, experiment for what works best for you!)  This is possible because blueberries, raspberries, strawberries are a negative caloric fruit.  Try using other fruit like, Mangos, Lemon/Limes, peach, pineapple, and oranges are just a few others!

These were amazing! I made mine tropical themed with pineapples, oranges, and a few strawberries and pineapple yogurt. I made the mistake of using greek yogurt, which made them a bit too thick, so I added some Malibu Rum (not enough to be too strong or to curdle up the yogurt) and they turned out perfect.

The original recipe made way too much for the 8 popsicle forms I have.  Next time, I'll reduce it by half, if not more.  I used the prescribed 1/4 c. sugar, and I found it much too sweet.  (I had used vanilla yogurt as the base.)  Next time I'll omit nearly all sugar, and maybe add a small amount of cinnamon or alcohol-free vanilla instead.  I look forward to trying smoothie popsicles with peaches this summer.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is a great base for just about any type of popsicles you want to make!  I defrosted a bag of frozen sliced peaches in the microwave - then put those with 3 cups of French Vanilla yogurt, 1/2 c. sugar, and 1/3 cup milk in the blender.....and voila - my peaches and cream popsicles came out fabulous!!!

Great pops recipe. I used strawberries and bannanas with strawberry and bannana yogurt instead of vanilla it was great, next time I'm going to not use sugar it was plenty sweet. Great recipe for people of all ages.

Grandkids loved these and I felt good letting them have them.  They aren't good fruit eaters but gobbled these up.  I made both banana/berry and banana/peach.  I left out the sugar and used fruit flavored yogurts with no complaints on lack of sweetness.  I also used frozen fruits including my bananas and the consistancy was great in terms of not melting quickly and creaminess.  Thanks so much april20!!

These were really good, not as refreshing as I expected but tasty anyways. I didn't blend the mixture because we like our fruit a little chunky, I just mixed well by hand and cut the fruit into small pieces. I made some pops with fresh peach and some with fresh strawberries and they were yummy!

We make these weekly for toddlers and adults! The first time I tried only strawberries, but adding a banana (to make 2 cups total) made them less tart for us. I fill up 6 popsicle forms and 6 dixie cups with popsicle sticks stuck through saran wrap with the current recipe yield.

I made these with strawberries and bananas.  They seemed to turn out very good- and they are a very healthy sweet-tooth satisfyer.  I love the creamy texture- and appearently my mom does too, because she eats atleast one a day!

I have been trying to cut things like ice cream from my diet.  I miss it!  But these yogurt pops are a great, healthy substitute.  I used plain, lowfat yogurt and sweetened it with a teaspoon of honey instead of using the sugar.

So easy and tasty. My 18 month old loved it! 

I just used frozen fruit that I thawed, low-fat vanilla yogurt and the sugar. It made a great smoothie too.

I made these with mango and banana, and left out the sugar because it was sweet enough without it. They were very tasty, but a little icy.

Thanks! I needed something healthy to replace fattening ice cream - but I'll replace the sugar w/ stevia or splenda.

Pretty good.  I thought they were a bit icy, but otherwise they taste pretty nice.  I used greek yogurt and used peaches instead of raspberries since I didn't have any.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had 4 tiny apricots that were very ripe so I threw them into the blender along  with the blueberries, strawberries and banana (didn't have raspberries). I used coconut vanilla yogurt because that's what I had. They turned out real good.

I use plain Greek yogurt, and Agave nectar for sweetness, not as much as 1/4 cup, about two tablespoons depending on the sweetness of the fruit. I've used honey also. You can use just about any fruit that is in season, but the combo listed in the recipe is the best tasting.

The kids loved this.  Much more nutritious than store bought popsicles which are full of sugar and dyes.  Very easy to make.  I used popsicle holders which can be purchased in some grocery stores or Walmart.

Very good. The only thing I did different was not add the sugar. The combination of the ripe bananas and blueberries that I used with yoplait flavored yogurt was sweet enough. The bottom of the paper cups slightly stuck on my frozen popsicles when peeling. I had to rinse paper stuck on bottoms off with water. Next time I will use plastic cups instead of paper cups.

Such a great idea and so versatile.  The first time I made these according to the directions.  Have made these many times since changing fruits but staying with the same base - being yogurt.  However, now, if I am using strawberries for example and I want to give it more of that taste I use strawberry yogurt.  I have even bought a couple of proper popsicle makers for my great granddaughter to hold and of course myself.  Thanks for a great idea and easy recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe.  The yogurt makes this a great consistency.  I made this with 1/2 cup raspberry yogurt and 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt. I also used frozen berries. The hardest part of this recipe is sharing it!

These were so simple to make and really delicious!  I didn't have any plain yogurt, so I used a mixed berry flavor of yogurt. I so didn't use paper cups as we have plastic molds for Popsicles and used those. Our whole family loved these and they went fast!

I really liked this recipe. I made it with fresh strawberries and banana, and with plain Greek Yogurt. I used silicone molds with tin foil over top and popsicle sticks. They came out great!

Next time I will probably try honey instead of sugar though. Otherwise, I'll definitely make this again - it's a really healthy and refreshing snack in the summer. 

(For anyone interested, I plan to write up my experience with this and other popsicle recipes on my Tumblr, which you can find at whoknewicouldcook.tumblr.com.)

This worked well! Though, I can't imagine adding sugar or sicky-sweet and unhealthy artificial sweeteners to yogurt and sweet fruit. I used banana, mango and blueberries and didn't blend the berries or mango. My son ate one for breakfast despite the cold weather.

I love this, and so does my little boy. They are so healthy, that we have eaten them for breakfast. They are also a good way to use up your fruit after a couple of days. Thanks for the great recipe!

You don't need to add sugar. The fruit and yogurt are sweet enough on their own. I took two stars off because I had to tweak the recipe to make it healthy. You could add honey, but it really doesn't need it. I like adding a banana too.

I really liked this and it was really easy to make, but next time I will strain the fruit through a strainer so you won't get the seeds.  I didn't mind the seeds, but my kids didn't like it. :(

I love this recipe!  So easy and healthy. I made a couple changes. No sugar.  Didn't blend the fruit.  If you like the idea of the posted recipe, but are too lazy to make it, try it this way.  https://goo.gl/ph7iVu

Really great recipe. You can definitely use whatever fruits you like. I had frozen pineapple, mango, peaches and strawberries on hand so I used that, it turned out great! I used honey instead of sugar, and the amount depends on the type of yogurt and the sweetness of the fruit. I also left it a little chunky and the texture was very nice. This is my new favorite popsicle recipe, and the extra is great for smoothies!

I used plain frozen strawberries, and it was amazing! I followed some other person's advice and used only some of the sugar. I also added a tiny bit of milk because it was really thick. Super delicious, all my family loved it. Will make it again for SURE!!!

Perfect for smoothies or Popsicles. Used plain yogurt and added vanilla. Everybody loved it. Can use whatever fruits you have on hand.

LOVED this recipe! Fresh, organic from our home. Did substitute honey and only used a little as fruit was plenty sweet. Will be a summer household staple.

Made with vanilla greek yogurt, fresh strawberries and 1/8 cup sugar. Had small amounts of icy flecks in it that my kids and I liked. Seems like you could also just freeze the mixture and scoop like ice cream.

Delicious!  I had some vanilla yogurt and some fruit in the fridge, both of which were going to spoil in the next couple of days if I didn't use them up, so this was the perfect recipe.  It took me no time to mix them up and get them in the freezer.  I had the banana out and ready to put in the recipe and forgot it - but they still tasted amazing.  I am excited to try out different fruits.  What a great summer treat to have on hand!

A super easy and delicious yogurt pop for the kids. My daughter loved helping and being the taste tester! I used honey instead of sugar and I am going to try agave nectar next time. Thanks!
