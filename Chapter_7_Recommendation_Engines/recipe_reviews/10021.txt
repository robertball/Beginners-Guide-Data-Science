I am the queen of lemon square. I make them about once a week!   for perfect lemon squares: 1. mix the flour and cold butter with your hands. once that is done add the p.sugar. I use a 9x9 pan. 2. only bake the crust for 15 minutes. 3. when making the filling I always add lemon zest. I use most of the lemon. I let my nose tell me it's enough. then I add all the juice form the lemon. 4. after I poor the filling into to hot crust i bake it for 20 more minutes.  they come out PERFECT every time. even my friends that don't like sweets love these. they are so fast to make and i always have everything on hand.

This recipe was awful.  The crust was way to thick for the pan. The top of the lemon squares turned dark brown while cooking. This is definately not the recipe that my mother and I used to make!

This recipe was easy to follow and tasted pretty good when it was finished. The only problem I had was it never really cooked, it was like a liquidy gel in the middle, it never solidified and became cake like.

I had lost my original recipe for lemon squares-this one does not compare. Tasteless, and too brown on top.  Needs more lemon, and is missing something else I cant put my finger on.

A nice crust and good texture to the filling, but almost NO lemon flavour, and I had increased lemon juice to 3 tbsp.  I like my Lemon Square to make me pucker, and this just didn't do it.

These didnt turn out too well.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very brown on top which didnt add a good taste too it.  I couldnt get them out of the supposed to be "ungreased" pan and when I did the crust crumbled.  They were not lemony tasting at all even with the extra tbsp of juice I added.  Will not make again.

I think this recipe is excellent. I followed the directions but added the following:  the rind and juice of two lemons. Many reviewers suggested that the bars were not too lemony.

This cookie crust was very good. It was adequate for a 9"x9" square pan. Next time I make this recipe, I will double the the "cookie" part as I prefer a thicker base.

Thanks for sharing a great recipe and thanks to reviewers as well for their remarks.

If you love lemon bars, try this recipe. I think its very delicious and extremely easy to make. It also uses ingredients that most kitchens would be likely to have on hand.

These were SOOO good. We had company over, my dad's college friend and his family with 2 little kids (3 and 6,) so i needed to do something with them to keep them occupied. They loved making this recipe and it's so easy and quick so there was stuff for them to do to. I  thought this recipe wold be really bland with only 2 tbs of lemon juice but they had a lot of flavor. Defiantly making them again :)

i doubled the amount of lemon juice and added some lemon zest to make the taste more lemony. keep a close watch on the oven though since baking it the full time tends to slightly burn them.

I would double check the recipe. It doesn't incorporate flour into the lemon mix. I noticed while assembling the ingredients it didn't look right and sure enough. It notes use baking powder, this makes things rise not thicken. Anyways happy cooking!

Used cold butter cubed and made the entire recipe in the food processor.  Reduced the sugar in the crust to 3 TBS.  Didn't use 1/3 cup of powdered sugar to dust with...maybe like 2-3 TBS.  Other than those minor changes, made the recipe as written.  Made a good lemon bar!  Would make again.

This little bar is delicious! My Meyer lemon tree produced its first lemon and I wanted to use it to make something special. This was delicious. It's sweet, chewy, crumbly and yummy. What a great treat after waiting so long for my lemon to ripen :)

This recipe does not taste like lemon at all!  Simply makes a butter/sugar bar.  I will not spend the time to modify because there are much better recipes out there.

Overall this was OK but not lemony enough.  I added more lemon juice.  Also, had to bake an extra 5 minutes - was very gooey.  My guests liked them though and that is what counts!

Good lemon bar. Could have been a little more tart. Next time I will grate lemon rind to use with Meyer lemons.  Also I will butter the sides of the pan.

It was very good. I forgot to put the sugar in my crust, so instead I put it in my lemon filling.

This is definitely a keeper recipe! Instead of the suggested 20 minutes for the crust, I would change that to fifteen, because it was a little overdone. The fillig was great, and it made a great birthday suprise for my sister!

I added 2tbsp more lemon juice and more zest as suggested.  I was concerned that it would not set with the extra liquid so I added about a tsp of flour.  I would not if I made it again.
