This is a great way to tenderize a cheap cut of meat such as sirloin.  I put everything into a ziploc bag and added a little minced fresh garlic.  I let this marinate for a couple of hours in the fridge then brought the steaks to room temperature before sticking them on the grill. This was easy and went great with baked potatoes and a garden salad.

Seeing as I live in Montreal there is no way I could give this a bad rating. ;) Just a couple of tips... first thing you have to do is use a good quality soy sauce, if it's made in North America leave it on the shelf. Look for an imported brand such as Pearl River Bridge, or an imported Kikkoman's (check the label). Use a light rather than a dark soy sauce for a less salty, less intense soy flavour. Don't be fooled by the domestic brands of "light" soy sauce. They just mean lower sodium content and have nothing to do with the actual taste or quality, they still taste terrible! Last tip, add a dash of liquid smoke to the marinade for a true grilled flavour if you are using a gas bbq or electric grill such as a George Foreman or broiling it in the oven.

Hubby and I are purists when it comes to steak--a good steak needs nothing more than a little salt and pepper and someone who knows how to cook it properly. However, we wanted to try something different for a change and this did not disappoint. I used T-Bones, but I'd really be interested to see how, if at all, this might tenderize a less tender sirloin. The flavor is hard to describe, as no one of the ingredients is overpowering, which is just as it should be. All I know is that it's pretty darn good! This won't convert us from our simply grilled steaks, but it was a pleasant departure!

What I love about this recipe, is of course the quickness, but it really dresses up an inexpensive cut of meat.  The flavor is scrumptious and I have used the recipe with a marinade time of 30 minutes as well as 24 hours...30 minutes is very good and tenderizes extremely well.

This is a great wonderfully simple marinade.  It can do wonder with steaks at the last minute as well.  I used the spicy Montreal steak seasoning and will keep this recipe in mind the next time I need a fast steak marinade.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used just a tad less soy sauce than it call for.  I marinated 2lbs of Ribeyes for about 4 hours and then grilled them and my family all raved about them!  This will be a recipe we use over and over. By far the best steaks we have ever made!!

Good Basic Steak Recipe.  I can't give 5 stars because instead of Soy Sauce I used Worcestershire which seems like a better match with steak and montreal.  A regular in our house

This was good.  I have used this recipe several times and thought I should sit and write the review.  I do cut back on the oil a lot.  I don't like that much.  I also don't always marinade it.  This a good and fast way to prepare a quick and delicious meal.  Thanks.

I guess I am the odd "woman" out on this one!  I didn't care for it at all and I love all the ingredients.  I couldn't even eat mine.  However, I am giving it 3 stars because my husband was able to eat his but he asked that I not make this again.  Thanks anyway McCormick.

This is way too salty. I used this recipe over and over and it was always great when using generic brand Seasoning. I make my own, its easy and its fresh and taste lot better than McCormicks'. McCormicks is way too salty.

I made this marinade exactly as described and marinated some very expensive Tri Tip steaks overnight.  I like salty beef but this was nuts! This might have worked if severely diluted with water and a denser piece of meat used.

Used this steak for a last-minute drop in dinner guest--he is picky, and said it was the best steak he had ever tasted.  We used sirloin tip, then cut it into nice thin ribbons for serving--grilled it indoors on the cuisinart griddler (we used the cuisinart indoor grill recently on holiday) and it was simply perfect.  Our guests requested the steak for BREAKFAST--cold--it was so good!

I am incompetent when it comes to making steak, let alone doing it in the oven on broil, but this recipe was great! I cut it in half and marinated a pound of sirloin steaks for about 20 minutes then broiled for 4 minutes on each side for a nice med/med-rare on the 1" thick steaks. Even though I only marinated for 20minutes, the steaks had the flavor of the spices. I followed directions and added the recommended amount of soy sauce, but if I were to have marinated longer, it probably would have become too salty. I sliced this up to throw on top of salad mix. This fooled people into thinking I actually know how to cook steak!

SAL-TY first time and then I tweaked the marinade the second and it was much better. Used 1/8c soy sauce, 1/8 Worcestershire sauce and 3T seasoning. Less salty, but still very flavorful. Still might add less seasoning...I know the seasoning is good sprinkled on tips and then grilled...I did that all last summer.

These steaks were tasty!  I think it would be a five-star recipe if I used slightly more of the seasoning (or maybe tried the spicy version) and marinated the steaks longer than the thirty minutes recommended.  Even as it was, though, it gave the meat a great flavor.

I used the Spicy Montreal Seasoning, also by McCormick and it tasted great! This recipe is so simple and takes minimal effort. I used lite soy sauce. I let the beef marinate for about an hour and broiled it in the oven for 10 minutes per side (I used two tenderloins that were pretty thick).

This is the ONLY marinade I use now on my strip steaks.  Tip...make sure you purchase thick (1" - 1 1/2" thick)steaks.  Preheat grill long enough on high heat to sear in the juices. close lid- turn once half way thru. Grill about 10 minutes total for medium rare...the best way to eat steak!!!!!

I used New York Strip steaks for this recipe and it was great! The flavor of the soy sauce was a little overpowering so I may decrease the amount next time. The spices in the montreal mix were wonderful!

Delicious marinade! Try substituting the regular McCormicks Steak Seasoning with McCormicks SPICY Steak Seasoning...it's adds a nice little kick!

My boyfriend said it was the best steak he ever had... full of flavor! I pierced the steak with a fork before marninating so that more would soak through.

So easy and so wonderful.  I had bought some Montreal seasoning and couldn't wait to try it out.  Best few dollars I've spent in a while.  We used it on Top Sirloin.  It was just wonderful.  I did make one change though.  I added 2 tbs. A1 sauce to the marinade.  It was superb!

This was pretty good. I did change it up a bit tho. I added garlic powder, liquid smoke and worchester sauce. I marinaded some sirloin steaks for about 2 hours and they were great. Bet they would have been better if the BBQ king hadn't over done them. I like mine med-rare and I got med-well. Even over cooked this was really good tho. Thanks, this is a keeper.

The marinade smells wonderful and our steaks had a great flavor. The soy sauce was a bit much for us. So now when I make this I use a bit of Worcestershire sauce, and leave out the soy sauce. Yum!

For all the flavor this marinade imparts, it's practically a crime that it's so simple. I use this on top round and flank steaks, leaving friends and family happily mystified.

This steak was absolutely delicious. A little too much soy sauce for my preference; made the steaks a little too salty. Overall though a great recipe and very, very easy.

The family LOVED this marinade.  Hubby & dear sons raved about the flavor of the steak and devoured it all between them.  Good thing I prepared chicken for us females because we didn't have a chance at it.

This was by far the best steak I have ever made.  I never used to buy steak and cook it at home because I could never find a good marinade.  My husband said this was better than any steak ordered in a restaurant!! I marinaded for 1 hour instead of half an hour. I used t-bones, next I will try sirloin.  This is absolutly a keeper!!

Very good. I used the low sodium soy sauce and scored the sirloin prior to putting in to marinate. Will be making this again.

This is a Winner! I used a thick cut sirloin and marinated for 4 hrs and it was beautifully tender and flavorful. The only thing I would do differently is to use a low sodium soy sauce next time, since this may be a little too salty for some tastes with the regular soy sauce.
 The aroma while on the BBQ was making our mouths water. Great recipe!!

I have never made this recipe, but I can tell you this is great. I have used olive oil, minced garlic and Montreal Steak Seasoning on all steaks for many years, always with the very best results.  I cant imagine a steak without Montreal Steak Seasoning.

Delicious!  I too, added the juice of one lemon and marinated my ribeye steaks for about 9 hours.  Juicy, tender, and flavorful with each bite.  My hubby didn't even need A1!  I will probably cut back on the olive oil next time...I don't know that it needed that much.  Thanks for sharing...we've always loved the Montreal Steak Seasoning on various meats...this combo makes a tremendous steak!

This was great!  I used sirloin steak and marinated it for about 5 hours, turning it occasionally.  I did not think that the marinade had too much oil.  I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make this recipe again.

Absolutely delicious! I've used Montreal Steak Seasoning before all by itself which is very tasty, but with the added soy sauce and olive oil it really was the bomb! This is my marinade of choice from now on. Everyone was raving! I used Porterhouse instead of Sirloin. So Good!!

Used low-sodium soy sauce and added a squeeze of fresh lemon. Marinated for three hours and placed on a very hot grill. Great flavor.

These steaks were delicious! I used tenderloins, and they melted in our mouths. However, they were a bit salty which is why they lost a star. In the future, I'll try low sodium soya sauce.

This is a new regular recipe at my house! This is a super easy weeknight dinner, just marinade overnight and BBQ when you get home! I topped my steak with grilled onions. Yummy!

This was the best steak marinade recipe ever. My husband and I eat at steakhouses often, and this recipe was great! My family kept saying "Great steak mom!" Thanks McCormick!

So easy! So delicious! I let the steak marinade for 90 minutes as I had the time; it was juicy and flavorful - a great dish.

Bf loved this, so I guess I'm going to have to make steak like this again.  It's too cold to grill here right now, so I broiled the steak instead.  I had a monster huge piece of steak (really didn't think it was that much until I put the marinade in, actually!) so it took longer than 10 minutes on each side for it to be done.  I had to put in for another 5 min on each side.  Very simple and very flavorful.  For the leftovers we'll probably slice and do a pita sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'd been trying to broil steaks for a while and they always turned out awful but this was great. Will even use this recipe on the grill. Might be good with chicken. Thanks.

Had last minute company from out of town, sent husband out for some rib-eye steaks and used this marinade.  Wow, I was surprised at how good these were, everybody thought I had come up with a real winner - I was embarassed to tell them how easy and quick it was!  Will be using this one again for sure.  Thanks!

I just bought a new indoor grill and tried this recipe. It was wonderful! Nothing beats Montreal seasoning for steaks. I don't think I have made a steak in years that I haven't sprinkled Montreal seasoning on. This was the first time I used it in a marinade. Thanks for this great recipe!

I'm giving this five stars even though I didn't have Montreal Steak seasoning on hand, I only had Kansas City Steak Seasoning.  It still turned out to be the BEST steak I have EVER had.  I am not a steak eater, least of all the fatty parts, yet I gobbled up TWO sirloin steaks.  One at dinner and the second one at lunch the next day COLD.  It didn't need reheating.  This is definitely a keeper.  It was salty, which was fine with me, but for those watching the salt or don't like salty steaks, reduce the amount of soy sauce.

The steaks turned out great! I used lite soy sauce & cut it down to 1/8 C after reading comments. I also added a dash of liquid smoke & a dash of Worcestershire sauce. We marinated them for about 45 mins, I wanted to do it for an hour but we were too hungry to wait. I wanted strip steaks but 2 lbs came out to $23 so we went with sirloin steaks wich was about $14. We cooked them for 8  mins on the George Foreman Grill.  I'm going to used the leftover steak for sandwiches for tomorrow's lunch. Thanks.

Pretty good but I wish it was a little bit sweeter.  Also I feel like the marinade made the steaks tougher, but I'm not totally sure.  Still good flavor though, but really salty.

This is a really excellent and simple marinade.  You don't have to use the seasoning it calls for necessarily -- any steak grilling seasoning will work.  As usual with steaks, the quality of the meal will depend largely on the quality of the meat you are using.

Really good & so easy. I halved the steak seasoning & it was perfect. Also subbed out half the soy sauce with Worchestershire per reviews. Marinated 2 hours. Steak sauce not necessary!

Fantastic!  I used low sodium soy sauce and even though I had double the steak I didn't double the marinade (not enough room in the dish anyway).  Marinaded the meat for ~3 hours and it wasn't too salty at all.

We used London Broil for this and used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and worchershire mixed as some other reviewers suggested. We also used the grill seasoning but cut back as we thought it was to much for us. Came out tender and juicy, thanks for the post.

I followed this recipe exactly, though I should have done as others suggested and cutback on the soy sauce, but salty does not begin to describe it! We couldn't eat it because it was so salty! I don't think it was the soy sauce though. I think it was the Mccormick seasoning. 4 tsp doesn't seem like a lot for 2 pounds of steak really, so I don't get it. Otherwise, the steaks were tender enough.

Plenty of flavor (I used the spicy version of seasoning) but not very tender, unfortunately. It's very easy, though, so I'll probably change some things and make it again.

This was sooo good! I let it marinate longer, like several hours, but only because I wasn't gona be home.. I don't think it would have needed that lengthy time. It was a keeper. I'll fix it time and time again. It has become one of my favorite ways to fix steak. Couldn't be beat in a restaurant.

Soooooooo good!  My husband marinated 2 strip steaks (he halved the recipe) for 24 hours, then grilled them to perfection.  Beef heaven!  We didn't find the recipe too salty... but we DO always use low sodium soy sauce.

THIS WAS OK.  I USED HALF THE SPICES AND HALF THE SOY SAUCE AND IT WAS STILL TOO SALTY! AND I'M A PERSON WHO LOVES EVERYTHING SALTY.

THANK YOU! I made this tonight for my husband and he was very impressed.  I don't like any seasoning on my steak and he loves extra flavour - so it's often difficult to please both of us.  My husband raved about the flavour and I enjoyed the flavour as well.  Only one problem all the olive oil did cause the BBQ to flare when we put the steak on - so be careful!

This was ok. Nothing great. It was actually kind of salty even though I used a low sodium soy. Maybe I marinated for too long (8 hours).Plus the oil tends to create a lot of smoke and flare ups when cooking.

This is an excellent marinade.  Montreal seasoning is certainly an integral ingredient, but the soy and olive oil definately lend themselves to the flavor.  Excellent!  The longer the marinating time, the better.

This was so good.  I cubed the steak and stir fried it in the marinade with onions and green peppers.  It was a hit with my whole family.

I made this last night and it was wonderful!  I did slightly reduce the amount of soy sauce, but kept everything else the same.  It was an excellent, very quick marinade that I will definitely use again!

Adds a very nice flavor to steak.  I used the spicy montereal seasoning. Marinated the steak all afternoon in a ziploc.  Will definately be using this again.
