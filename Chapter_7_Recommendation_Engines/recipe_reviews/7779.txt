I made this cake for my daughter's 12th birthday yesterday.  I called it my I-cake since it's the first recipe I'd made from the internet.  It was a tremendous success. There is one error in the recipe, though.  It states to bake for 90 minutes.  I baked for 25 minutes and it was golden brown.  Thanks Cali for sharing!!

This is a delicious cake and the taste of black walnut is not overwhelming!  The cooking time is NOT off if you use a bundt pan - it cooked for 80-90 mins.  I made this cake for my husband's birthday in a fancy bundt pan, just sprinkled with confectioner's sugar before serving, rather than frosting it, it got RAVE reviews.
