I took this one step further and stirred a little garlic powder into the butter and spread that on the bread. I also used Sargento deli sliced sharp cheddar cheese. We loved this. My oldest boy actually ate two. Next time, I'll try this with deli sliced ham or turkey. I think that would be good, too.

Simply delicious!  I had some leftover bacon that was already cooked so this was a great was to use it up.  This was perfect for lunch with some tomato soup - especially since it's such a gloomy, rainy day today....

We have grilled cheese (GCs) at least 3 or 4 times a month, and I've added tomato before but never thought about adding bacon. I used some thick sliced bacon that I had baked with brown sugar sprinkled over the top. I spread a little mayonnaise on the bread, added cojack cheese, tomato slices and the salty/sweet bacon, then grilled it with butter. It was almost like a bacon cheeseburger--delicious--thanks for a great idea.

I love these. It may be a kid recipe but it is a quick balanced meal for grownups too. One reviewer commented about thinking they needed twice the bacon and cheese. For an adult I always serve 2 single slices of bread with the cheese tomato and bacon on each slice, made open face under the broiler. No butter is used. The bread gets toasted around the edges but not much on the bottoms (I like this texture) and you get twice the bacon and cheese. The tomato tends to get juicy when cooked so I use a fork. Also, when I do make bacon I cook the whole pound and freeze the extra slices in a freezer bag. (If any survive that long!) They do not stick to each other frozen. Remove as many strips as you need. It's pre-cooked and they reheat and crisp up as you broil. I especially love this sandwich when ripe tomatoes are in season. White American slices are my preferred cheese. Broil until the cheese starts to melt and brown a little, where exposed. The bacon on top will also begin to show blackened high spots.

I made this wonderful sandwich with lite mayo instead of butter. I served it with tomato basil soup and the hubby was in heaven. He said he has never had a grilled cheese sandwich that tasted so good. I also used colby,cheddar and monterey jack cheeses.

Thanks for posting this recipe. It inspired me to really expand the "grilled cheese & soup" meal that I fall back on when short on time. Last night we added onion, avacado, turkey, spinach and cilantro.

I craved this non-stop during my pregnancy.  It seems like an odd combo, but is very yummy.  I even got my hubby hooked on these.  So needless to say, we still make these for a quick dinner, even though I'm not pregnant.

I made several variations of this.  I prefer them with pepperjack cheese.  My boyfriend and I preferred the sandwiches open faced - bread, cheese, bacon and tomato.  Very good recipe as is, but if you want to be creative with the concept it tastes good as well.  I also made them with pepperoni slices in the middle, but it wasn't our favorite.

I just made one change when I made these.  I used Pepper Jack cheese.  I always have to make my husband and sons 2 of these sandwiches.  They won't settle for plain grilled cheese again!

Most of us grew up on grilled cheese sandwiches. But when you add a slice of bacon with tomato -delicious! Loved how the saltiness of the bacon paried nicely with the melted cheese and tomatoes! I used thick slices of bacon, cooked it and layed it on a bunch of paper towels to get as much of the grease out. I also added a little mayo with the butter because we love mayonnaise on sandwiches. I also added some manoa lettuce. This paired nicely with, "Basil Tomato Soup," also from this website.

The taste was really good.  A twist to it would be adding garlic butter instead of regular butter.

I build my sandwich on the counter & butter the top slice of bread.  Flip the sandwich over when I place it in the plan.  Then I butter the top slice.  This is easier for me.  Rye bread is one of my favorite ways to make this sandwich.  I'm also going to try whole grain bread.  That's a very sturdy bread & should hold together well.  No bacon?  Use ham.  No Ham?  Try some fresh spinach.  Options are endless..

I knew this would be a great combination, how do you go wrong with cheese, bacon, and tomato? My hubby on the other hand had his reservations, so I held on to this recipe for over 2 months waiting to use it with his permission ;)  Well that never happened and I sprang it on him last Monday, a day I was really looking to prepare something fairly simple and quick. I made a couple of these and a couple of regular grilled cheese sandwiches.....I hardly got to have one! My hubby LOVED them! He's not even a fan of tomatoes but said it wasn't a complete sandwich without it!  I was quite surprised!  This will be added to our "need something quick and easy" recipe collection! Thanks Missy!

I love these! Great way to get a picky eater to eat a vegetable. Only thing we did different was to use sliced, Swiss process cheese and a large Roma tomato as we had those on hand. Since the slices were smaller, we put 4-6 slices on each sandwich (we only made two sandwiches).

Good way to jazz up a grilled cheese sandwich!  We used one slice of American, one slice pepper jack, and left off the tomato.  Broiled until done - yummy!

Delicious!  I spread mayo on each slice of bread, layered cheese, tomato, and bacon over it.  We broiled them open faced - so each slice of bread had the goodies layered on them, for a doubled stacked sandwich.  I put a bit of salt and pepper on my tomato (I am pregnant, so I crave a lot of salt), but you may not want to.  I think next time I'm going to add carmalized onions, or even fry them up a bit to make them crispy.  My husband who is not a big fan of tomatoes (he likes them alright, just not a HUGE fan) loved this sandwich.  We will definitely be making these again and again!

These are so good! We use to serve these on the merchant ships and it was always my favorite lunch. I only use one slice of cheese though. Between the butter, bacon, and cheese there is enough grease and fat going on.

This is a great combo. I used only one slice of cheese on mine, and that's plenty of cheese for me.

This is like a sandwich I made for my hubby when he worked long hours and arrived home after the family had eaten. I grilled my version and sprinkled a dash of Worcestershire over the tomato. Great flavor!

Also good done on a panini grill of course, but I like to spread a little spicy mustard on the inside of the bread before grilling, and if you want to make it healthier, throw in some spinach leaves.

I have been doing this recipe for years.  Before grilling add a slice of unsmoked provolone.  After grilling open sandwich and add a generous tablespoon of prepared horsradish if you dare.  You'll have a creamy, stretchy sandwich with a good bite!!!

Very tasty and easy-to-make snack! I didn't add the tomatoes, but the bacon was a lovely touch. First time I've ever made grilled cheese! Thanks a lot, definitely using this again! ~Bae :)

This is great.  I used whole wheat bread, center cut bacon, and sharp cheese, and no butter.  I put a very thin layer of light mayo inside the sandwich, and bake them in the oven at 400 degrees for 9 minutes.  So good and easy!

I think that the ingredient amounts are off. For 4 sandwiches I use at least 3 slices of bacon each and 2 slices of cheese each. So, for 4 sandwiches, I would use 12 slices of bacon, and 8 slices of cheese. Also, I cook the bacon in the microwave to save time. To make a dinner meal serve with soup. Delish!

this is a very nice sandwich. i used whole wheat bread, land o lakes american cheese & slab bacon. local ripe tomatoes made things all the better.
the allotted amount of butter works well & doesn't make the sandwich too greasy. my boyfriend thought this tasted cheesy but on the same note he also asked for seconds! i served this with the terrific "grilled corn of the cob" from this website. thank you missy!

Yummy!  I have been making these for years with thinly sliced tomatoes between the slices of cheese, one White American, one Colby Jack.  If you're hurried and don't have time to make bacon, try thinly sliced ham.

I have been making an open-face version of this sandwich for years on English muffins under the broiler.  I partially cook the bacon, spread the muffins with a mixture of butter and Dijon mustard, and put the cheese, tomatoes, and bacon and place under the broiler. the bacon crisps and the cheese melts.

This is a great recipe. I prefer PRE-SLICED THICK  1/2" FRENCH BREAD for a nice texture and flavor. 
My son and husband love this recipe with home made potato soup.

Really great. Best when you slice the tomatoes really thin, otherwise, they tend to overpower the rest of the flavors in the sandwich. It all depends on how much you like tomatoes.

We love these for something different from just a plain grilled cheese sandwich! I mean, you can NEVER go wrong with a grilled cheese sandwich, but the addition of the tomatoes and bacon just put it over the top. If your looking for something simple and delicious, give this recipe a try! :)

this is how my family has made these for years. Sometimes it's just the tomato..sometimes just the bacon - sometimes both...but NEVER do we have just grilled cheese! Once you make it this way, you won't either.

Mmmmm! I am ashamed to admit that I used some of the bacon grease instead of butter... but the sandwiches tasted absolutely delicious! This is definitely not something I would make every week, but it's a great for a little treat every now and again. Thanks!

Really good. I used Velveeta cheese slices and Jimmy Dean Hickory Smoked (pre-cooked) bacon.  I actually cooked the bacon on a flat griddle for 5-7 minutes to get it nice and crispy. This is a keeper.  Thanks!

I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST OKAY. MY HUSBAND LIKE THEM BETTER THAN ME. I USED SWISS CHEESE ON MINE AND PROVOLONE ON MY HUBBY'S. I ALSO USED PRECOOKED BACON. I MIGHT MAKE AGAIN IF I WAS IN A HURRY.

Great sandwich! I use the precooked bacon and it makes it even easier.

Well I was really looking forward to making this for lunch.  BLT is my favorite sandwich. But was not at all what expected to taste like. The cheese over powers the bacon and the tomato made the bread very soggy. I guess I will stick my  favorite BLT. I was very disappointed.

I love this! The cheese helps to "set" the slice of tomato when you grill the cheese side first. It also helps to keep the bread from getting "soggy" when grilling. I did put salad dressing on the bacon side after grilling. it's a BLT with cheese instead of lettuce. Maybe I'll call it a BCT. LOL!!

Excellent minimal ingredient recipe! Classic comfort food with a hint of tangy tomato and savory bacon! Add some salt & pepper on your sliced tomatoes, and you got yourself a super delicious lunch or dinner sandwich!

LOVED IT Added a few red pepper flakes. Have also done 
in oven open face. Will continue to make. I make many packages of bacon , cut up , in a through away foil pan , on BBQ ,
in spring and fall , and freeze.  It makes recipes like this easy 
to make without a mess from bacon.

I will definitely make again ...delicious.  A bit testy trying to turn without losing tomatoes in the skillet, but being very careful it is not impossible.  It grilled to a very crunchy bread.  I baked the bacon which eliminated the fat ending up on my stove...

Recommend putting the tomato slices between a couple of layers of paper towel to wick away some of the moisture for about a minute or so prior to placing on the sandwiches.

Wonderful.  Quick easy and affordable.  Bacon can be made earlier, if it last that long, and refrigerated.  Go for the whole family.

I make it with Sourdough bread, Swiss cheese, and add chopped green onions to the mix. After buttering the bread, put a lite sprinkle of garlic salt/powder before grilling. Make this for my friends and they went crazy for it. Will be making  again soon: can't wait for football season when I make my hearty veg. soup and will serve this along side! Not your grandma's grilled cheese, for sure!

One thing i have learned is that, if you substitute mayonnaise for the butter, it browns nice and golden.  Just need a very thin spreading of mayo - not a bunch.  Other wise, this is the perfect comfort sandwich!

What could be simpler,  especially if you just cook a few extra slices of bacon at breakfast ?   Come lunch, it's as fast and as a simple a grilled cheese.  Try a variety of different cheeses for a real treat  : )

If you add a burger into this sandwich, you will have the best bacon cheeseburger you have ever devoured.  Was doing this on my restaurant menu 20 years ago.

Excellent idea to add bacon and tomato in grilled cheese! I've added tomato before, but not bacon. Easy to use whatever cheese or cheeses you like too. I used Cheddar instead of American. Would go great with tomato soup! Will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I've always been a fan of a nice slice of tomato on my grilled cheese sandwiches.  The bacon takes it to the next level.  I also used 4 State Cheddar shredded cheese and thew on some slices of fresh jalapeno to give it a little kick, all on Texas Toast.  Fantastic!

Never could quite get a grilled cheese sandwich right let alone a grilled cheese bacon and tomato sandwich. This recipe was simple easy and delicious. Only thing I did was substitute mayo for the butter. YUMMY...??

Tasted great, added garlic powder and pepper  to the butter, and changed the bacon to pepperoni (out of bacon) and it was a major win.

Simple, yet great. Just make sure to use the right cheese, get the juice out of the tomato and don't squish the bread, or you'll be eating it with a fork, like me. I'm the opposite of a good cook, but this worked out great. Thank you!

I made this for dinner and instead of using bread, I used corn tortilla instead and flattened it using a panini maker.  The crunch it gave everyone was enjoyable enough to eat.  I serve this with Lentil Salad and everyone was definitely  full.

It was totally delicious. However I only put two pieces of bacon cut into halves on each one, next time I think I will bee adding two more pieces of bacon seeing as I'm a bacon lover. Very good family loved it. Ate it with some tomato soup.

Try Mayo on the outside of the bread, farmhouse bread is great. I used Canada baconnslices without cooking and mustard. Yummy.

I really liked but my kids said they enjoy the "normal grilled cheese" better.  Oh well, I guess I will make just for me next time.  Thanks

Good sandwich....ummmmm, bacon!  I followed this recipe to a T, I don't know why.  I got center cut bacon, fresh ripe tomato at the farmers' market, and then used american cheese.  This recipe is calling out for a good sharp cheddar in my opinion.  It was good enough with american, but I think cheddar would really make this terrific.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these tonight with some soup and they were delish. I did add some naughty mayo to it and it was super. When I worked at Friendly's they had a sandwich very similar to this and it reminds me of this one. Will make again!

I have eaten grilled cheese and tomato sandwichs before, but the bacon in this sandwich was a nice touch!  It makes a good summer supper when you don't feel like cooking something big.  We made ours with whole wheat bread and it was just as good.
