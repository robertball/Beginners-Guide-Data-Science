These turned out YUMMY! Due to allergies that my daughter has, we made a few substitutions. I used Crystalized Fructose instead of sugar, Shortening instead of Butter, Brown Rice Flour instead of wheat. For the brownies, I used 1 tsp Maple syrup instead of Vanilla and I replaced the tsp of vanilla with 1/2 tsp Mint extract in the frosting. The frosting was a bit dry when mixing, so I added a small amount of applesauce...worked GREAT!

These brownies are pretty good! I prefer chewy brownies, these are cake like brownies. I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, and did not use the frosting. Instead of using an 8 inch pan I used a muffin pan, the mix made 9 muffins, baked for 14 minutes.

This was the best and the healthiest brownies I've ever had. But my family didn't really want to use sugar. So I replaced the 1/2 cup of sugar with 5 tablespoons of honey and it turned out GREAT! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe. I will make it again and again.

The brownies tasted ok but there are some issues.  You need to double or triple the recipe.  It came out about 1/4" thick. I would reduce the egg and add more sugar.  If this is supposedly 'healthier' I don't know why it adds butter to the frosting.  It hardens when cooled.  The ingredients list calls for 3 T cocoa but the instructions call for 2 T.  I only used 1 T and that was fine. It was so runny (greasy from the butter) that I had to add another 1/2 cup powdered sugar.

I was a little iffy with the ingredients, not sure if they'd turn out to taste like regular brownies. But when I shared them with my brother and his friends, as well as classmates and co-workers, they all love them! I made them for Valentine's day as a little sweet treat. ;)
I didn't make the frosting, I bought it instead because I didn't have the time to make the frosting! But this is my now go-to recipe for 'healthy' brownies!

Turned out super, but I did use 4 tablespoons of butter in frosting instead of 3.

I made these yesterday to use with Williams Sonoma ice cream sandwich molds.  I made 2 batches, one almost  eactly as written and one with coconut oil instead of butter(I ran out of butter).  The only change I made was to cut he sugar a tad.  I used between 1/3 and 1/2of a cup of sugar.  Both recipes were excellent!  I never make brownies because I can't eat something that requires  so much butter.

These were just "ok" warm but so much better cold after being in the fridge all night! I'm more of a chewy/ fudgy consistency brownie lover myself, so after reading reviews saying it was cakey I added just a small handful of semi sweet chocolate chips. I only used maybe 1/6 or less of the frosting in a very thin layer while hot and it was enough, I can't imagine using all of it.

Loved it ! I used organic coconut sugar  instead of white sugar and whole wheat pastry flour and I doubled the batch  it is a cake brownie which I like! Unfortunately I followed the recipe and put in 3 T of cocoa in the icing which was  to much I should have used the 2 T that was recommended further in the recipe! Other then that it was awesome!!

I made these exactly as written except that I skipped the frosting and used this as a base for the S'more Brownie recipe.  My chocolate brownie loving BF raved from his first bite.  Said they were the best brownies I had made so far...I didn't bother to mention the healthy part ;)

Yummy!  These brownies turned out great!   They are more a cake like than chewy.  I love using less sugar and butter. My usual go to recipe calls for twice the amount of this recipe.
I did not make the icing.

I thought this was great. I made according to the recipe,  without the frosting. Baked 20 minutes. I like that they aren't so overly sweet like many brownies, but sweet enough and chocolatey.

I was really hoping this recipe would be "the one" my kids would love and we could share without guilt with their sports teams. I love that they are made with the white whole wheat flour and the texture was good.  I baked mine about 15 min. (because my oven bakes some things a little quicker), and they were still a tad dry. They do come out very thin and somewhat cakey, which I don't mind. I opted not to make the frosting because my teens don't like the taste of honey, but they needed a little more sweetness for our taste. May try doubling these and modifying some of the other ingredients next time.

Excellent!  They are a bit more plain than the regular brownie, but I also exchanged the butter in the brownie mix to plain Greek yogurt. Also doubled to recipe.

It doesn't taste like a real full-fledged brownie, probably because it's healthier. I'll have to experiment more to get perfect results...

I used oat flour instead of wheat, but I can't figure out what else might have changed this recipe.  They are too cake-like and not very sweet, and they never seem to look done in the oven.  I have had better brownies from a box, substituting applesauce for oil.  Will not make these again.

I've made this several times now. I did change it a little. I use a 9x13 and you have to double the recipe for sure. Instead of applesauce I use 1 ripe mashed banana and 1/3 cup sour cream or greek yogurt. Brownies still come out very moist and my family loves the chocolate banana flavor. I make cream cheese frosting with neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese which seems healthier than the butter (plus tasted better!) The pan disappears in a day every time.
