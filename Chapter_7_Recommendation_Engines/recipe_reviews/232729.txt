Very tasty! Perfect for Christmas with holiday red and green chocolate chips. I may, next time, (because there will be a next time), try using 1 C butter instead of 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C shortening. Either way, we really enjoy these beautiful chocolatey cookies. Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't care much for these cookies. Seemed like the inside was cake like, and dough wasnt easy to work with.

I just used white chocolate morsels. The texture of the cookie was amazing soft, moist, crumbly and oh so very chocolatey! Will definitely be making again!

Made these tonight.  Delicious cookies. The dough  was a tad dry,  as I used almost 1 cup of cocoa powder, so I added a bit of oil, problem solved. 
I made the cookies with peppermint  m&m and peppermint extract. I love chocolate and peppermint together.. I will definitely make these again.....

Based on my son's milk , soy and peanut allergies, I was able to adapt this recipe with success. I used Earth Balance spread for the butter/shortening and Enjoy Life chocolate chips. They came out great.

We made these cookies today and they are very good! The only reason I gave this recipe four stars instead of five is because although we followed the directions to a T, the dough turned out very stiff. I would recommend adding 2-3 tablespoons of milk to soften the dough up a bit and make it easier to work with. I also used special dark cocoa and it made the flavor so rich and decadent. I will definitely be making these again!

These cookies turned out great! They were quick to throw together and came out with a perfect mixture of crunchy edges with chewy centers when baked on a stone. I may try them with peppermint chips next, because the only way I can imagine improvement on double chocolate is with peppermint :)   -Bonnie
