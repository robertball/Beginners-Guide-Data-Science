I just made these last night and I think they are fantastic. I love hazelnuts and I love Nutella, so it was the perfect recipe for me. I doubled the batch and it made more than 24, and I also ground up the hazelnuts, since I don't love taking a big bite of a cupcake and getting a huge piece of nut. I added a little but more Nutella to the frosting, and the frosting is truly creamy...the best buttercream I've ever made. A very good recipe! It's the perfect combo...the cupcake tastes like a brownie and the frosting balances out the heaviness of the brownie!

I just used the frosting recipe for a hazelnut brown recipe I had and it is amazing.  It is so smooth and creamy and deliciously chocolate.

I like these brownie cupcakes a lot.  I think I went a lil over board with the nutella, i put a scoop in the batter as well.  A little goes a long way with that nutella, I think Ill skip putting nutella in the batter next time.  Overall they turned out nicely.

Definitely the best cupcake I have ever made!  Wow this was fantastic.  I did not include any of the nuts, unfortunately, because my family doesn't eat them; regardless still a super recipe. This is a keeper, and actually pretty easy to make, which really surprised me.  Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful dessert :-)

Just made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious! I did not add the extra hazelnuts, but when I make this again I will probably add some on top, as a garnish. Next time, I will also make the brownies from scratch.
The frosting was absolutely amazing! I thought the 1 T of milk was enough - the consistency was light and airy and fluffy. I may substitute cream for milk next time, just to try.

I only made the frosting, but it's to die for!  It's light, creamy, and not too sweet.  I've never been a big Nutella fan, but had a jar sitting there and thought that I'd try this frosting.  It's definitely one that I'll make again.  I doubled the recipe to frost a cake.  There was a little left over, but I'm sure that it won't go to waste.

I just made the frosting for some cupcakes. Added some Lor-An Choc-Hazelnut oil because I was a little short on Nutella. Absolutely delicious.

I only made the frosting because my daughter had already made chocolate cupcakes. If you put this on chocolate cupcakes, the frosting needs more Nutella. It’s fine as it is, but would be better with more flavor. I’m sure if you put it on the brownies in this recipe, though, it would be good the way it is.

frosting is good but missing a kick. I'll try adding more nutella next time. the brownies overpower the frosting and it really can't be detected. may be better with a cupcake but with a brownie it is not flavorful enough.
