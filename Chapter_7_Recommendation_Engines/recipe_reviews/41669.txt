I made this vegetarian with a beef-flavored vegetable soup base in place of the broth. I doubled the basil, garlic, and allspice. I also added a little tvp along with the tomatoes and liquid. This turned out a little thin, so next time I will also increase the cornstarch. The flavor was quite nice, though. If I had doubled the cayenne, I think my kids would have rejected it. As is, it was a satisfying, healthy dinner.

I added ground beef to this and also several sprigs of fresh thyme. It reminded me of a tastier, healthier version of hamburger gravy and rice from my school day. In the best possible way of course:) Nice base flavors and good basic recipe.

This recipe was a lot of fun.  There was plenty of cutting for my children to do and so making it was a family affair.  I did add more garlic and used soy sauce instead of 1/4 cup water, but the broth before that was pretty tasty...just had to make it unique :).  The cayenne gives it a bit of a kick, but it was ok for all 4 of my kids.  I have no idea what Squambo is supposed to taste like, but I think it would be a good way to use up various, fresh vegetables before they go bad.  Yum!
