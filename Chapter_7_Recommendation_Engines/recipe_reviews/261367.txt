I did not change anything.  But next time I will not cook the bacon/bean mixture as long because the beans get a little mushy.  The taste was very good...not your momma's Spanish Rice!

This was excellent! The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the onion. I love onions but one chopped onion divided was plenty (probably even too much for most people) for 1 cup of rice. Tonight was the first night I had ever added bacon to Spanish rice. I actually made two different rice recipes that called for it so it must be more common that I would have thought. I'll be adding it every chance I get now. It was really good. I also liked the fact that this recipe incorporated the rice and beans all into one. The recipe didn't say to do so but I recommend draining your beans. Great recipe!
