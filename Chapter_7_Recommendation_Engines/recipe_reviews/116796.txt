This recipe was wonderful.  I did add more rhubarb as others suggested, and used twice as much cornstarch so that the crunch was thicker and not runny.  I will make this again and again and have recieved requests from two different people for the recipe.  TY

I needed 5-6 stalks of rhubarb to get the 4 c. needed. I cut the sugar down to 1 c. and used all of the crumb at topping instead of making a crust. It was delicious!

This stuff is amazing.  My great-grandmother cooked a lot with rhubarb, so we were looking for something to take to my parents' 50th anniversary adn tried this, thinking the adults, but not the kids would like it.  Every single person loved it.  My advice would be to press the bottom lawyer of crisp down really hard, which makes it nice and crunchy.  We served it with vanilla bean ice cream and it was just the bomb!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly as posted except that I used a food processor for mixing the dry crust ingredients and cutting in the butter. I put the ingredients in the processor in half-batches. This saved a lot of time and took the guesswork out of dividing the crumb mixture for the bottom and the top. Of course, doing it this way did grind up the oats, but it turned out perfectly. Excellent combination of sweet and tart. Thank you, Charlene, for posting this great recipe for all that rhubarb in the garden!

Great! I reduced both types of sugar by almost half cup and substituted whole wheat flour for white. Turned out really well.

Made this for dinner tonight.  While assembling ingredients I remembered a recipe I've made in the past, so I pulled it to compare.  It's almost identical; the only differences were in the sauce.  The old recipe calls for 1 cup sugar and 2 TBSP cornstarch.  It's made the same way, though obviously the result is thicker.  When vanilla is added, 2TBSP butter is stirred into the sauce.  While both recipies are exceptionally good,  the thicker sauce allows the topping to become crrisp.  Love rhubarb; love crisps; I'm happy!  (Charlene, thank you for posting!)

I have been making rhubarb crunch since I was a child (I'm now 59!)  I have occasionally tried other recipes, but I always come back to this one.  It was a favorite with friends and family in the US and now I'm asked for the recipe in England.  The ingredients can be found anywhere and it's easy to make.

I have made this recipe many many times and it is a hit every time.  It works great with frozen rhubarb; I even save the water from the thawing rhubarb to use in the sauce and it enhances the flavor wonderfully.

I love rhubarb but this is a recipe for people who want to overpower the taste of rhubarb with sugar and crumb. The rhubarb to crumb ratio is off. There is far too much crumb and not enough rhubarb and not enough liquid. The rhubarb cooked dry and sticky - sticky sweet. The whole thing was way too sweet even though I reduced the sugar as others have suggested. Rhubarb is supposed to be tart - not over come by sugar. 

I did like that the crumb mixture goes under as well as over the rhubarb. Had there more rhubarb in between that would have been nice.

Very easy and quick to make.  I thought the crust on bottom got very hard.  The flavor was great, especially the next day.  The topping wasn't as cruchy as I like. personally, so I would maybe just use less of it.  Overall, I loved it.  Heated in microwave with a scoop of vanilla ice cream- Perfect!

I really liked this recipe, I just changed the rhubarb for blueberry's and added some almond slivers for more crunch. It was a big hit at the last BBQ!

I cut brown sugar in half and reg sugar down to 1 cup. It was very good and sweet enough. My sugar syrup didnt thicken but I poured it over the rhubarb and baked as directed. Turned out great. Bottom was not hard. Perfect. So many recipes have so much sugar. I was happy this turned out so well with much less than other recipes.

No leftovers!! :-(

It was my first time cooking with rhubarb and it was the perfect combo of sweet and tang. It was a little mushy inside but everyone gobbling it up said they liked it that way.

Assembled and cooked as directed, did add a bit of orange zest to the rhubarb as I had an orange begging to be used. Crisp turned out great, perfect texture, great flavors, was a family hit!

This recipe is identical to my mom's and she is from Wisconsin.  It's the best way I have ever had rhubarb.  Ocassionally, I don't have enough rhubarb, so add some apple pieces (not strawberries like most people), because I feel the baked texture is closer.  Love, love, love.

This is the only rhubarb crunch recipe that I use.  I did double
the cornstarch.  This recipe is superb and have made this
on numerous occasions.  Always a hit and even those who do
not care for rhubarb have loved it.

Sweet and yet a little tart. It was a hit with everyone, even the kids who don't like any kinds of crisp. Takes about 30 minutes to make but it's delicious. Probably the only rhubarb crisp I'll make from now on.

Very Very good.  Easy to make with ingrediants you probably have already (except the rhubarb) but if you are looking for something to do with your garden rhubarb I would highely recommend this.   Did use 4 teaspoons of corn starch and it worked out great.

My family of four liked this recipe.  I had to substitute the 8 x 8 metal pan for a 9 x 6 glass pan (it boiled over a bit in the oven - pan was just too small - my fault.)  Although my family didn't mention it - I thought there was too much cinnamon and not enough sugar for me.  I will use this crumb recipe and thickening method with any type of in-season fruit.  We did serve it with vanilla ice cream. This recipe is absolutely worth trying.  Enjoy!

I did covert this to Vegan to suit my family- changing the white sugar to raw sugar, butter to soy butter.  Love it, love it, love it.  The second time I made it (the very next week)- I added 1/4 cup of wheat germ and 1 cup of sliced strawberries. Still wonderful. This recipe inspired me to add rhubarb in my organic garden so i can make this all the time!!!!! Thanks so much.

Excellent recipe.  I only used 1/2 c flour for the crust.  And I definitely did not need as much rhubarb as called for.  Still, very delicious.  The cornstarch mixture really makes a difference.

Way too sweet. I couldn't taste the rhubarb at all -- just sugar. Next time I will use half the sugar.

Very tasty.  I used a multigrain hot cereal.  I ate a huge portion for lunch.

Delightfull!  I added a bit of maple syprup  in place of some of the sugar.  Served with FF Cool Whip.  Comfort food!

I followed another reviewers suggestion and decided to use my food processor to cut in the cold butter.  I did half of the flour and half of the brown sugar and half cold butter processed this until it was mixed then did the second half.  Poured each mixture into a bowl and then mixed in the oats so they wouldn't be pulverized by the food processor.  I used a 9x13 glass pan (so I would have enough to serve 10 people for fathers day) and  made a thin crust  on the bottom.  Prepared the sauce.  I had to use an extra teaspoon of corn starch to get the mixture to thicken.  Spread the rest of the crumble mixture on top and baked for a little over an hour.  It turned out delicious.

I love this recipe!  I cut the flour to 3/4 C, increase oats to 1 1/2 C, & increase corn starch to 4 tsp.

I made this exactly like the recipe and it was absolutely delicious!  My husband is demanding that I make it again and it's only been two weeks since the last batch.

I've never liked rhubarb cobbler, but my family loves it so I made some. I couldn't keep out of it! It was SO good!
