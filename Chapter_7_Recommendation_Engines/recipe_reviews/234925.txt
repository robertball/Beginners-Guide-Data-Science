These taste fantastic, and are surprisingly easy to make, but I have 2 suggestions:

1. I used more milk than the 1 tablespoon this recipe called for (about 3 tablespoons instead).  This was because I found it very difficult to mix without the powdered sugar going everywhere, and adding a little bit more milk made it easier.  Another solution if you do not want to use more milk would be to add the sugar one cup at a time, mixing thoroughly before adding the next cup so that you do not make such a mess.

2. It was really tough to cut them into squares without the chocolate base just breaking into its own pieces that did not necessarily match the squares I was going for.

These turned out great.  I had to chill them (December in Florida) before cutting. Some of the drizzle tried to lift up, just press down lightly with a fork to make it stay. Really good!
