OMG, the flavors are spectacular!  I love this cake!  A couple things, I would like just one big cake, not two little ones.  Maybe cook a large cake in a water bath for a longer time.  Also I was not familiar with the cajeta.  It tasted good to me but I thought it was too sticky for people with dental issues aka dentures lol.    I am going to try with Hersheys caramel syrup so my husband doesn't get lockjaw haha.  LOVE THIS RECIPE - WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN!

We call this flancocho back home in PR. We usually do not make it with spice cake but with yellow cake or by mixing in chunks of ready-made pound cake with the flan mixture. I wanted to try this recipe because of the cajeta and the spice cake variation. I think it is great but I did have a hard time with the cajeta (dulce de leche) because it was very hard to spread it evenly in the pans. What worked for me was putting some cajeta in the pans and then putting the pans in the oven for a few minutes for it to soften enough so that I could spread it easier. Still, I would rather make a regular flan caramel (heating/caramelizing sugar and water) and use that next time instead of the cajeta. I think it would taste better and also it would look prettier when flipped.

Made this tonight almost on a dare to myself. I was fairly certain it was going to be a disaster. It turned out wonderfully. The cake is moist, the flan is almost perfect. I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter and am thrilled with the result.

Have made it before as directed and loved it.  Tried making it as one cake in a steam bath and it fell apart, so don't try it!

I made this as directed and found a couple things didn't turn out so well.  the cajeta was hard to spread and when I turned them over,  the cakes split from the flan. that was a real disappointment.  the taste to me however was great! it wasn't as big as a hit as I thought it would be with my friends though.
