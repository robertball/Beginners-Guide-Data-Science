Really delicious!  These are going to become standards to have in the fridge for the kids to grab on the way to college every morning -- they are VERY satisfying.  We didn't have buttermilk on hand, so we used skim milk with a little added vinegar.  Also used a cup of whole wheat flour instead of the white flour (with a teaspoon of baking soda instead of a half to make up for it) and used turkey sausage instead of pork.  Quite yummiful!

Next time we'd like to use little cubes of cheese (and more of it!) instead of shredded cheese, as we felt the shredded cheese taste gets lost in all the marvelous ingredients.  Unfortunately, the pinch of cayenne wasn't noticeable....being from New Mexico, we plan to add chopped green chile next time.   Also thinking about scrambling about 8 or 10 eggs with a little salt, then filling each muffin tin half way with recipe mix, adding a tablespoon of scrambled egg in a small depression, then fill each tin with recipe mix the rest of the way.  We think the egg will get done, but not sure.  There will likely be closer to 15 or 16 muffins then, as our first batch of 12 were all quite big, though maybe that's because we didnt measure out the green onions, cheese, and corn -- just used a good amount.

Another splendid recipe, Chef John -- keep up the good work!

This is a great breakfast-to-go for my teen-age boys who seem to be always on the run.   A dozen of these muffins is not enough in my house!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My only problem was that the paper liners were difficult to remove from the muffins (whether warm or cool).  I will be making them again and will try greasing the pan instead of using paper liners.

I made these for a camping trip, as they seemed like the perfect quick, hand-held, all-in-one breakfast.  They lacked in flavor and moisture.  I shortened the recommended cooking time by 15 min, and yet they were still dry.  The recommendation to add a soft-boiled egg seemed brilliant, but did not seem to work with regular-size muffins.  The egg filled the entire muffin cup and there was just a tiny bit of muffin mixture around the outside of the egg, which promptly fell off as soon as it came out of the pan.  Made 18 muffin.  My kids refused to eat them, and my husband said he would eat them on camping trips, but would not go for them at home.  I might play around with the recipe and see if it can be improved with more moisture and seasoning.

So yummy! I didn't have cornmeal or enough sausage, so instead I used a 50:50 sausage bacon combo and used grits en lieu of cornmeal.  It turned out wonderful and my family loved having something yummy to grab while heading out the door.

I made these today and, like all recipes I have tried from Chef John, they were delicious! I used a mixture of red bell pepper and poblano peppers. I also used Tennessee Pride Hot breakfast sausage. I should have used the pinch of salt but when slathered with salted butter you don't miss it. Very moist and dense. These will be great to send with hubby for breakfast.

I just want to add a comment, I have not made these yet but I plan on it very soon, the one thing everyone seems to complain about is that they stick to the muffin papers.  So, when I make them I will spray the muffins papers, that has helped me in the past with this problem. Hope this helps. I am giving this a good rating because everyone else said they were good and I couldn't give this tip without a rating.  :)

I followed the  recipe, using a mild Italian Sausage. I baked these for about 22 minutes in a high end teflon muffin pan. After baking, the muffins were stuck to the liner paper. I had enough leftover dough to make 3 more muffins, so I baked them with no liner of any sort and they came out great! These are delicious! I would service my eggs on the side... Thank You Chef John!

These muffins were pretty delicious... but looking at the ingredients, something would be pretty wrong if they weren't.  I'm guessing they'll freeze well, so we'll try them out in lunch boxes, too. Main problem is that about a fifth of each muffin sticks to the paper liner. Next time I'll prep the muffin tins with butter and flour and hope for a better result. More than a pinch of cayenne will also be good: I couldn't really taste it here. I used good local sausage. Also used duck eggs b/c that's what I had: don't know if they made the muffins stick more than usual.

Made these in a hurry one morning. Turned out great. Some bites did feel a little dry but not sure what I'd change to make it more moist. Most bites were perfect. I did use ground turkey sausage and it worked well enough. I'm sure regular sausage would be even tastier. Used baker's joy spray (since I'd read the muffin liners stuck) and poured right into muffin cup tray - no sticking whatsoever at removal.

This turned out pretty good actually!  I found this when I was looking for recipes to use up some extra buttermilk.  I used ground chicken sausage and 1/2 tsp of cayenne (although honestly I could use probably 1.5-2 x next time).  I skipped the paper liners and just sprayed the muffin tins with a little olive oil and they came out super easy.  I made just a couple of changes - I skipped the olive oil (the sausage has enough fat to not stick to the pan), used whole wheat flour, and a total of 1  c of cheddar cheese (3/4 in the muffin and 1/4 on top).  Next time I will add just a little salt (maybe 1/4 tsp?).  Perfect served warm with a little butter.

I love Chef John. As a child who grew up on Hamburger Helper, he's shown me techniques that I managed to miss learning in decades of cooking from books. But....these were awful.  They were so dry and crumbling that I ended up breaking them apart, toasting in the oven for a few minutes, then adding heavy  cream, eggs, and herbs to make a cornbread dressing for some Cornish game hens.  It  was actually good, hence the second star.

The recipe as is rates a weak 4.  This is the first time I made it, love the concept but found it a bit hum-drum.  I noted comments about being dry so I used cream corn to a bit more moisture.  I upped the cayenne to a healthy half teaspoon and used close to a cup of cheese.  The sausage meat I used I season with garlic and onion pepper.  However after all that I still found it a bit lacking.  The cayenne worked out but I'm thinking next time I'll add a 1/2 teaspoon of scotch bonnet salt and maybe some thyme or basil.

They tasted best straight out of the oven. But as soon as they cooled they became dry and crumbly.

This recipe was okay. If I made this again I go against Chef John's advice and keep the spices up with the hot sausage and seasoning. As it was I followed his suggestions and used breakfast and only a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne and it came out kind of boring.
