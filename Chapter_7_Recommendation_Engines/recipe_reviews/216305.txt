This was really great, I did double the balsamic for a little more kick, and I seasoned the steak with pepper, garlic, and red pepper flakes, also added red pepper flakes to the sauce as it cooked with the vegetables. YUM!

Definitely a good meal when served with Spanish rice. I cooked the steak in one piece the first time it was in the skillet but when I returned it to the pan with the veggies, etc. I cut it into slices. Not a particularly flavorful dish but very popular. I made double the portion for 6 guests and it was all gone.

This recipe actually popped up in a search for steak fajitas so I thought "why not?"  I sliced the beef into thin strips before beginning the recipe and omitted the water so the sauce wouldn't be too thin.  I served on small taco size tortillas.  Just a little messy but so good!  DH, my picky eater had six!  Definitely a keeper!

I made this a couple weeks ago, used one red and one green pepper, served it with mashed potatoes and a fresh salad.  It was wonderful!  Only ate half and reheated the next day, chopping up the steak into smaller pieces which made a wonderful stew.  Highly recommend.

This was yummy.  And super easy.  I served it with the 'Best Spanish Rice' recipe. I also chopped the red pepper by accident and it worked.  It was great. I tasted it in the pan and then realized I forgot the cheese. It was yummy either way.  we are cheese people so in went the cheese.  It has room to add and spice if you want.  I just added a little extra pepper. thanks for the great addition to my recipe book!!

Added fajita seasoning to the meat in the skillet which helped with the blandness that earlier reviews warned about.  Still, this won't be a repeat recipe.  Also, it seemed to wrong adding the soup to the beautiful crisp tender vegetables.

Very good. Seasoned steak w/ some salt and garlic pepper first.  Can definately see why some people put over rice. Family loved it.

Really good.  I misread the ingredients and sliced the steak into 3/4 inch strips (whoops, I feel dumb), so it came out really chewy/tough, but the flavors were solid.  Delicious sauce, and loved the peppers and onions.  Not your typical fajitas (heavy taco/fajita flavoring), but savory and delicious and great with cheese as mentioned by others.  Also doubled the balsamic and would do that again next time.  I would love a more tender cut of steak.

Good, was a bit bland. Bf said I should marinate the meet first next time. I did season it with salt and pepper before putting it into the skillet. Would make it again.

A very straightforward dish and simple to follow.  An interesting blend of flavors, but nonetheless satisfying.  I served this with mashed potatoes.  I will certainly try this again as it would be a fantastic filling for fajitas.

Followed recipe exactly but found this to be lacking flavour generally.  Would delete the water completely as sauce was watery. Perhaps the vegetables had too much retained water in them. You can always add more water later if you need it. Sorry but found it to be just o.k.

Quick to make, easy to get all the ingredients together and it works with any cream soup (we used Cream of Asparagus).  We cooked the steak very rare initially to allow the jus to mingle with the sauce, which turned out very delicious.  Definitely keeping this one in the recipe box.

Great idea but I think the original version needs something. I recommend marinating the meat ahead of time and adding some red pepper flakes and extra balsamic to the sauce.

The cheese really makes this dish. If it's not there, it's bland. But with it, it is a nice dish. Might make it again.

I was really thinking this would be good UNTIL I added the soup.  That's all you could taste.  Why buy a great sirloin and pour Campbell's soup on it?  The cheese didn't help.

My husband loved this recipe! This was easy and I already had all the ingredients in the house minus the cheese! I don't eat red meat but my husband does, so when he came home to see that I had prepared a steak for him he was thrilled! I crushed garlic on the raw meat before I seared it and let it marinate in the garlic salt and balsamic vinegar. He said it had a lot of flavor. I will be making this AGAIN! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I love this recipe because the meat is so tender. I made some changes to it - I marinaded the meat overnight in Teriyaki marinade sauce after seasoning it with meat tenderizer, low sodium salt and blackpepper. I could not find Goldene mushroom soup in the grocery store , aso i used Campbells condensed  beefy mushroom soup. I skipped the cheese. What a delicious, succelent steak!
