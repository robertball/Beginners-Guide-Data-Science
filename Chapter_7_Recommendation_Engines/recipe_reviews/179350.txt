Very tasty. Easy to make casserole. I uses either Jimmy Dean sage sausage or venison sausage and both taste amazing. Perfect for Christmas which this recipe is used in our home on holiday mornings. Since it has to soak in the pan overnight this is an easy holiday morning breakfast (or woman on the run) preheat oven then put in, brew a pot of coffee, watch kids open gifts (or get ready for a day on the go). It is perfect for me because I cook most of my dishes from scratch and since this is prepared the night before ( and I have obsessive compulsive disorder) I do not have to spend the whole morning cooking and cleaning the kitchen. Eveyon4e should try this delicous recipe.
