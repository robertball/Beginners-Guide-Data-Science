Turned out great! Made it true to the recipe (except I did half ground turkey, half beef) only thing I would do differently is brown the beef ahead in order to drain out the grease. I made the meat mixture early in the day in order to let the spices soak in. Whole family loved it (including the hubby who dislikes cauliflower).

Definitely, 5 stars for flavor and eye appeal.  This was delicious, and so satisfying to a casserole lover, like me!  Casseroles don't usually make the cut for Paleo followers, or Whole30 folks.  I have to say, I was very happy to find this recipe!  I did change it up a bit, but not much!  Here's what I did:  I used the ingredients for the meat mix, exactly as stated, and I started early in the day, before work.  I did change the method a bit, and I’m glad I did, because there was no way I could have managed all the ingredients in my 12” skillet.  I started the cauliflower in the steamer, and then I started browning the ground beef, adding all the spices and seasonings to the browned meat, then set the skillet aside, once it was done.  When the cauliflower was done, I put it in a strainer.  Then, I sautéed all the vegetables in the cauliflower pot.  When they were soft, I was able to combine them with the meat and stir in the tomato paste.  I put the meat mixture in a prepared casserole, covered it and refrigerated, until dinner.   For the cauli mash, since I am avoiding cheese, I opted to omit the cream cheese.  I used ghee, and about ½ c. chicken broth to the mash so it would blend for me.  I refrigerated this in a separate dish.  When it was time to prepare dinner, I placed the meat mixture in the oven as it pre-heated, and let it cook through.  Then, I stirred about ½ the beaten egg into the cauli mash to bind it a little, and brushed egg on top, as directed.

I made it lower in carbs by substituting the peas and carrots with a bag of kale, spinach, broccoli stalk and cabbage, which I added once the beef was browned, increased the tomato paste to 1/4 cup to hydrate these additions, and used sour cream instead of cream cheese, for ease of blending.  Love the spices in this dish.  Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made it (minus the peas and cream cheese - not paleo) and it was good.  I have yet to get my cauliflower mash to be a good substitute for potatoes, but otherwise the recipe was a good way to spice up some ground beef.

This is a WOW dish! I was looking for something that resembled our old shepherds pie that I used to make, but without the potatoes (since we are low carb). My husband and I didn't expect this recipe to blow our old one out of the water! Don't skip the egg topping, because it really gives the cauliflower amazing texture!

I made it with bagged frozen veggie mixes - zucchini, squash, asparagus all good additions.

I also used ground chicken instead, and stovetop cooked the veggies and browned the meat separately first, then mixed them topped, and baked at 400 for 20 mins.  Make sure to paprika the cauliflower topping!

I used a frozen bag of mixed veggies (peas, corn, carrots , Lima beans, green beans), 4 bags of frozen cauliflower, 1 small can of tomato paste, omitted the curry, used double the cream cheese and added sharp cheddar cheese on top. Otherwise I followed the recipe and directions given. This was delicious and we will be having it again.

It was good! Very surprised how good the cauliflower topping was because I do not like cauliflower mash, but in this dish it works.

I made it vegetarian but substituting crumbles for beef. This made it a bit bland...so I added siracha ketchup, garam masala and a tablespoon of tamari which added a lot of flavor.

This was absolutely amazing. I had a feeling it would be delicious since I’ve made the cauliflower mash on its own several times as a side. 
I used sour cream instead of cream cheese for the mash, added mushrooms, 1/2 sweet onion and 1 tomato (instead of the tomato paste) into the veggie mix and also added a layer of sweet corn in between the ground beef and cauli mash 
Not a huge fan of turmeric or cumin especially in ground beef so I left that out. But the fresh garlic, curry and Italian seasoning I used gave it the right pop. I also added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese on the top before baking instead of the egg wash
It was all gone by lunch time the next day, As the leftovers as usual was even better!

I use half as much onion as the recipe calls for added extra carrots and omitted the peas. Also I added a little bit of old cheddar chees on top. The family loved it and I will be making this again!

Not for me. A lot of work.  Made a huge mess in the kitchen.  The result was a “meh”.  Ok but not worth the trouble.

This was great - I made it just as it's posted. Wasn't sure how my husband would like the cauliflower mash; he was totally fine with it, yeah! I'm going to look for more Paleo recipes, now.

I made the Shepard's Pie as written except I topped it with mashed potatoes! Maybe next time I will go with the cauliflower. I would probably like it, but I wasn't sure about my husband who loves potatoes. I liked how the meat was spiced. I will definitely make it again!!!

I made this with ground turkey, Parmesan cheese since I didn't have cream cheese, and I used a lot more veggies than called for: Brussels sprouts, green beans, zucchini and mushrooms.  I otherwise made it exactly as written and it was delicious!  My husband said it was restaurant quality.  The herbs and spices give it a wonderful savory flavor, not particularly curry-like though it calls for curry spices.  Preparation is more elaborate than usual but you can take a break from cooking while you enjoy the leftovers, so it kind of equalizes.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I am sorry to give it 1 star- honestly it would be zero. I tasted the meat as per directions and it was so bland I doubled the spices- after adding the topping it helped but still the meat and dish is lacking in flavor. We will not make this again- this was not worth the ingredients or the time.

Actually fixed this for dinner tonight. Cut the recipe in half because we were just 3 people. Didn't make any changes to the recipe except that I mashed the cauliflower in my food processor, which yielded a very smooth consistency. We all loved it, and I will definitely make this again. Just wonderful!

Perfect flavors, this is a fantastic recipe. On the dinner rotation now for sure.
