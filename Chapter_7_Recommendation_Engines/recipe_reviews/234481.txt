My Husband loved this very rich chocolate cookie cake. I used 3  nine inch cake pans, added parchment paper, then sprayed the pans. It was very easy to remove the cookie layers. After adding some frosting to the two layers, I still had some frosting left over.

I wasn't sure what to expect texture wise for this cake. I couldn't tell if it would be more like a cookie or a cake. The answer is it is a little of both. It is like a huge layered soft amazing chocolate chip cookie. I made this for my daughter's 8th birthday and everybody raved about it and several people asked to take pieces home. The only change I made was to use different chocolate icing since I had some made already that needed used up. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

This recipe is THE BOMB!!! Perfect!! My daughter turned 16 and couldnt figure out what to make her because she doesnt eat cake! This fit the bill!! I didnt use the frosting part I ended up making her a chocolate chip cookie ice cream cake! Turns out nice and chewy and so soft at the same time! Delicious!! If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!!!

I made this after my son asked for a cookie cake. It was a hit and super easy. I used a different icing and it was great.

So sorry, but I had a horrid time with this ... #1) It's insanely sweet. #2) and perhaps I shouldn't give it a 2 rating because I did do as others suggested and baked in cake pans - maybe that was the problem, but: I let cake cool in pan 20", then turned the first one out - it was still warm and gooey and completely fell apart - that's when I saw the submitters note about making it a day ahead of time, but by then it was too late and I had to getterdone.  I popped the other 2 into the freezer to chill - waited another 20 minutes, and then turned them out.  Although perfectly cool to the touch, they immediately began to sink and crack, so presentation was soooo sad (grin).  On the plus side, they DO taste exactly like soft chocolate chip cookies.  But (as mentioned above) they are just SO sweet - nobody could finish even the smallest sliver...I'm so sorry - lovely concept.  Having said all that, I *do* think this would be great to make ahead of time (since batter makes 3) and then decorate and serve *individually* like those cookie-cake bakeries you see in the mall.  Final note:  someone mentioned not to overcook ... perhaps I was too careful with that as well - with final layer, I went the full 20 minutes then pulled ... that was the best layer of the three.

I made this cake twice now. Amazing! I always say I am better at cookie than baking, but with this everyone thinks it's done by an actual bakery! I plan on using apples in the fall with a caramel icing! So good!

This review is for the cookie cake, not the frosting.  I made it for my son's 9th birthday as he doesn't like cake.  Since he also doesn't like frosting, I didn't want to layer it.  So I halved the recipe and put about 2/3 of the batter into one 9" round cake pan greased with cooking spray.  (I made half a dozen cookies with the leftover batter).  It was a beautiful golden brown, and it was delicious!  Just like a big, soft chocolate chip cookie, a tiny bit chewier around the edges which was awesome.  I served it with vanilla ice cream.  My son actually ate his birthday cake for a change!  Hooray!

The cookie/cake was fabulous.  It's a cookie, no it's a cake.  It's both.
The icing was too sweet for my office colleagues who thought it would have been perfect without icing.

I neeeded a birthday cake for a coworker who loves choc chip cookies so I tried this.  It was really good!  I did what another reviewer suggested and used 3 9in round cake pans.  I just sprayed them well with cooking spray.  The layers were even and came out easily after a little help in getting them loose.  Do not overbake this cake.  As soon as it looks as if the batter will harden when taken out from the oven.

Wonderful Cookie Cake and so much cheaper and better tasting than the store bought. I made this for my class and tghe only change I made was to add the buttercream frosting instead of the one suggested.

It was awesome!!! My family loved it!! But the last time I made it I used a different frosting, today when I made it I used the frosting from the recipe, and it didn't taste as good, I suggest using a different chocolate frosting recipe. I used a different chocolate frosting off the allrecipe app!! Over all it was good
