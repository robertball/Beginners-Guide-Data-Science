My family loved this recipe! I was a little concerned about the shells not being open enough to stuff as so many of them were completely closed so I decided to to with manicotti pasta instead. I made a pastry bag with a zip lok bag which made filling the tubular pasta very easy. Because I was dealing with a larger pasta I assumed that the manicotti would require more liquid, which, as it turned out, certainly did. I used 2 l9oz cans and one l0oz. can of enchilada sauce. I also used two small jars of mild green chopped chilies in the meat mixture and for an extra kick, I sprinkled a combo of shredded cheddar and pepper jak cheese over the pasta. Yum!

This dish turned out absolutely delicious! My husband has requested that I make this every week.  I followed the recipe exact, the only thing I added was a taco packet and Mexican 4 cheese blend.  Thanks for posting this - I have now learned a new way to create baked pasta dishes.  I used the same recipe technique to make manicotti with traditional spaghetti sauce and ground beef, and also made a chicken cacciatore recipe. (I never knew you could bake noodles in the oven without cooking them first!)  I am thrilled :)

This was great!! A great alternaive to the italian shells. Original taste the only thing I did was instead of ricotta I added cottage cheese a southern substitute which we use for a lot of italian dishes, and I added green medium enchilada sauce. This was very easy to prepare. I highly recommend it!!

This was unfortunately the poorest allrecipes.com recipe we've tried. I made it to the tee... I'm thinking the enchilada sauce with the pasta ~ not so good.  My husband HATED it.  So sorry... can't think of a redeeming feature, except it WAS easy.  Maybe if rolled the turkey mixture in Bell Peppers and baked.  (?)

Wow! I'm impressed! Even my kids, 2 and 6 liked it.  I added black beans because I already had an open can and they were a perfect addition. I will definitely make this again, with the black beans.
Very flavorful.

Relatively simple recipe.  I was skeptical about using raw turkey and raw pasta shells, but they cooked up just fine.

I cut the recipe in half.  I used ground turkey breast.  I subbed chives since we don't like cilantro.  Used hot enchilada sauce -- spicy!  Used lowfat ricotta since the store didn't have nonfat.  I assembled the shells the night before so I could get dinner on the table sooner with less rushing after work.  Only baked about 45-50 minutes.

Pretty tasty. I found it very time consuming to stuff the shells. I made it again as a lasagna, that was easier. I added extra sauce so the noodles wouldn't be dry.

These were OK. I thought the filling was a little bland.

I just made this tonight, and since no one else commented about it being spicy, I'm wondering if I accidently put too much cumin in?!!  We liked it, but it was HOT!  I'll make again, with less cumin.  I didn't have cilantro, and will add next time as well.  It also made a lot of stuffing...much more than I expected.

We've made this three times, and we love it.  Low fat and delicious.  We make no changes except cutting down on the cilantro.

This recipe went over well in my family. I couldn't find shells, so I used manicotti. I left off the Monterey Jack to cut some of the fat and calories, and I added a chipotle pepper to the turkey mix. Also, I used one can of hot enchilada sauce and one mild. Good thing, because the turkey mix itself was a little bland.

This was good.  Have not made since the first time.  The filling was great, but I do not want to fill pasta again.

Good......but the stuffing is a little dry.  If I make it again I think I will add some shredded cheese to the mix.

These were so delicious and so easy to make! Great for left-over Turkey. Added a little extra ricotta  to over-stuff the shells -- was very good.

This recipe was ok, but the name is a bit misleading because it didn't taste much like a Mexican dish.  If you're in the mood for some Mexican food I would try something else, like enchiladas.

The whole family loved this recipe, didn't even notice I'd slipped them ground turkey.  Easy and filling.  Will make this one again.

This recipe was extremely tasty & easy to make.  I subbed fresh basil for cilantro and feta for the ricotta cheese.  It was easy to make, very little mess and time to tidy up while it was cooking. Will definitly make again!

Interesting twist on pasta.  If making for kids, I'd eliminate the cilantro.  : )

This was mediocre.  To save oven time I boiled the shells and cooked the turkey first, then assembled and baked for 30 minutes, using only one can of sauce.  It turned out fine but the taste was a little odd.  Someone's recipe for "Taco's in Pasta Shells" is similar, but somehow better.

We thought these were ok but nothing outstanding. I added some crushed red pepper flakes to the enchilada sauce to give it some heat. Husband thought this would be better with ground beef instead of turkey. I would also recommend using full-fat ricotta cheese. This was the first time I've used the non-fat variety, and it was virtually undetectable.

Fantastic recipe although I made several changes to accomodate what I had on hand. First I used lasagne noodles since I didn't have any shells. I cooked the shells in water for a few minutes then put a spoonful of the mixture and rolled them up. I also increased the cilantro to 1/2 cup because we love cilantro and added chopped mushrooms and chopped garlic. I sauteed the turkey with the onion, garlic and mushrooms. I skipped the oregano, cumin and ricotta. After I sauteed the turkey and veggies for just a couple of minutes, turkey was not fully cooked. I put 1/2 cup pepper jack and monterey jack into the mixture. I then put everything in the food processor and added 1/2 cup cilantro and blended it all together. I then rolled the mixture up in the lasagne shells and baked them in the oven for 20 minutes until turkey was completely cooked. I used a mixture of sour cream and salsa to top off the roll-ups. My husband loved it! We will have again weekly.

The stuff fell out of the shells when I'd try to scoop them up after cooking.  Also, make sure that all of the shells are covered in sauce so that they cook evenly.  Lastly, I didn't love this recipe cuz it was lacking additional flavor...maybe more salt or garlic should be added?  Perhaps a bit of lemon juice?  Overall, though, it was pretty tasty.
