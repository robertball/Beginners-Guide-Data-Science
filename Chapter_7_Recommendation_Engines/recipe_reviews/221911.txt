Loved this recipe ...We added black beans to our layers and chopped white onion instead of green onions..Lastly, we added a taco packet to the beans instead of the Fritos hot beans and it was perfection ...Great comfort food for sure..

Even by halving this recipe it makes a large amount. i missed the taco seasoning that we usually put in the beans, and the bean dip was expensive. I'll make my regular guacamole with lime and salt next time too, with 3 avocados

I used canned fat free refried beans instead of bean dip, low-fat sour cream, and reduced fat cheese to make it a lower calorie alternative. I also added a layer of green chilies, since Iâ€™m in the Southwest (we eat green Chile with everything!) lol

I hate black olives so I used green instead. It was actually good. I did add lemon juice and zest to the avocado. Next time I would not use the hot bean dip because it didn't seem necessary for me.
