This was a good recipe to satisfy a cherry pie craving. It has a good balance between the super tart cherries and sweet "goo". Next time I will reduce the amount of cornstarch used. It was rather rubbery before folding in the cherries.  I like mine juicier. It did make cutting and serving the pie a breeze. The taste was fantastic and well worth playing with the recipe.

Very good cherry pie that does not include sugar.  My family loved it on Thanksgiving.
