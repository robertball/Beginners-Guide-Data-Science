I have now attempted this seven times. No amount of kneading and no amount of resting seems to be able to get this dough to reach the kind of stretch needed to pull. 
It could be the use of AP flour. It could be the lack of salt. It's possible that I am just cursed. 
I am going to be starting on some of the other recipes around the web.

This recipe was great, 1st time ever making my own noodles and they were restaurant quality. I got better at pulling the noodles as I went!
