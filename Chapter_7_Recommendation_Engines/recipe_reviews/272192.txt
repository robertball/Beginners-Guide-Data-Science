I only made 1/2 of the recipe, so I sauteed 1/2 cup chopped  onions with 1/2 cup chopped portabello mushrooms and 3 smashed cloves of garlic in 1 tbsp EVOO. I also added 4 crumbled strips of pan fried vege bacon. I used 6 large eggs and 1 cup milk and 10 oz of frozen chopped spinach. I mixed all together in a bowl, then spooned mixture into lightly baked deep dish pie crust.  Had some mixture left over, so I added 2 more eggs to the bowl, sprayed a plain pie pan with Bakers Secret and baked the egg mixture seperately.  It all came out great!

It was good but next time I will try sauteing the onions first.
