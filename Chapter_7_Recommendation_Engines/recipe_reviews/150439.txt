I decided, at the last minute, to have fried rice with something my Daughter-in-law prepared.  This was good and quick.  Everyone liked it, thought it was really good for being so quick.  I didn't have the chicken broth, so I used chicken boullion, and it ended up a little salty, but I can't blame that on the recipe.  I actually "fried" it a little at the end by adding a little more oil, this seemed to take away the "Minute Rice" texture, and make it better.  I'd definitely use this recipe again when I'm pinched for time.

I made this tonight and boyfriend and I both loved it. I made it exactly like it said but accidentally put the veggies in frozen. I just let them heat slowly until thawed and then brought it to a boil- no biggie. I will definitely make this often. It was delicious and so easy. Served with teriyaki chicken~ YUM.

This is my default recipe for stir-fried rice.  I've been making this for so long that it's about time I comment on it.  I usually do not cook any vegetables in it though because I make chicken with broccoli when I serve this rice.  I cook exactly as stated, but at the end before I combine the egg, I add 1-2 minced garlic cloves (depending on size) and 3-4 tablespoons of Land O' Lakes Light Butter.  Once the butter melts throughout and egg is added, make sure it's well mixed.  Then, I just cap it for a few minutes on low to heat back up.  You can add some salt and pepper to taste as well, but you shouldn't need any more salt with the soy.  Let's just say it's the best stir-fried rice you'll ever eat!!!! Such a great foundation to complete my perfect stir-fried rice recipe!  Hope this helps and you enjoy!!

I was so surprised at how easy and great tasting this was.  I had to modify the rice- I had chicken flavor steam in the bag rice; so i used a 1/2 cup of water along with the soy sauce and steamed the rice in the pan.  I also added garlic powder and about 1/2 tsp ground ginger.
Super good- nothing left- my kids who won't touch take out fried rice asked for seconds. Will use again and will add meat.

Super easy.  I only did one thing different.  I added cooked pork loin that was left over.  I did not take anything out of the pan.  I just pused things to the side as needed.  my family, including picky children gobbled it down.  I would add an extra egg next time.

Very good and easy.  I also added about half a cup of shelled edamame and some finely chopped carrots to the vegetables.  I also added cubed chicken that I sauteed in some fresh ginger and garlic (at the same time you add the cooked egg to the mixture).  After I mixed everything up at the end, I sauteed the whole mixture briefly on med-high heat in about 1-2 T of butter that had been sauteed with some more fresh ginger.  Delicious and tasted very fresh and healthy (although I'm sure it would have been healthier without the butter).

I have tried so many "fried rice' recipes and this is the only one I'll be using from now on. Perfect as is, and of course you can add any accompaniments you prefer.

This was great, i thought it might be a bit bland but it was perfect. I added a bit more oil at the end of cooking to help the minute rice texture as someone else advised, thanks.

So easy and you can change up the veggies to suit your taste.  I used Brown Minute Rice and half a bag of frozen stir-fry vegs,  added fresh green onion, cabbage and mushrooms.   My dh who "hates" brown rice, LOVED it!

This recipe was okay.  Use ice cold rice. I also think that adding the eggs directly into the skillet with the rice is better than scrambling them in advance, setting them aside and using them later.

This recipe was great! I would recommend using 10-12 oz of the broth, instead of 14.5 oz. It was a little too "wet" with that much broth. Otherwise, great recipe!

Awesome!   I love this recipe.  Stir-fried rice is a huge hit in my family.  I add whatever veggies I want and toss it all together and it's perfect!  Thank you!  On a separate note...I did add a dash of onion and garlic powder (just to give it that extra oomph).

This recipe was fabulous! I couldn't believe it was made with minute rice. We opted to NOT add vegetables and it turned out awesome, but I think it would be even better with the veggies. We added a little oil and quick stir fried at the end per another suggestion. This was oh, so simple. I will use this recipe again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Very good, very simple recipe. We made this to go with a peanut chicken skewer recipe on here. It's delicious, not too salty, rice doesn't stick together. Will make this again for sure.

This is ok.  Its the same recipe that is on the back of the minute rice box minus the eggs.  Tastes nothing like "takeout".  Sorry I'll keep looking.

I did change a few things, first I bought mixed veggies instead of the stir fry ones so my rice had corn and beans in it and I added an onion. I also forgot to add the chicken broth, but I added 2 servings of rice that was already cooked.

I doubled this recipe and found I needed a little more broth that what the recipe calls for.  My family loved this dish, and there was plenty left over for a 2nd meal.  Will definitely make again!

I used sesame oil as another reviewer suggested and it made the eggs taste awful. I'm not sure if it was just because of that but this dish was pretty bad.

Very good, however I did make a change to it, I did not boil my rice and veggies in the broth because I used ww rice and it takes longer. I heated the veggies up in the broth, cooked the rice, drained the broth, added the rice and slowly added the broth until it evaporated. Then I added the egg right before serving (which I dont get because ill be eating it and all of a sudden and egg chunk, seems weird) Anyways it was very very good and surprisingly filling.

I would use fresh vegetables instead of frozen.  When I made this, the frozen vegetables were mushy and ruined the whole dish.

Extremely easy and quick! I followed the recipe without the veggies. I tasted the rice after letting it steam for 5 minutes and decided to put it back on the burner adding about 1 1/2 tablespoons of veggie oil and an egg and let it cook until it got to the consistency I liked. Then I added in the eggs I cooked before hand and it was PERFECT! :) This is my go to recipe for fried rice.

Nice basic fried rice recipe. I had a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies that needed used up so this was a perfect recipe for that purpose. I didn't realize the directions said to cook the rice in chicken broth. I had already cooked my rice seperatley in water. Oops. I added thinly sliced beef that also needed used up.  Topped with green onions.

This rice is simple to make for a large crowd and they will love it! I steamed brown rice the night before and left it covered on the stove.  I fried the veggies in olive oil right before the party then added the rice to the half cooked veggies. Once everything was cooked I stirred in the scrambled eggs and it came out perfect.  Many people asked for the recipe!!

I made this one night when the craving hit but it was too late for my favorite spots, it came out sort of bland so maybe an increase of dosage on broth and soy but for me this recipe did nothing. Still decent enough that night when you need a side dish fast.

Quick, easy and filling.  Definitely needs a a little extra flavoring in addition to the soy sauce.  I used sesame oil.

We actually only put in the egg without any of the veggies - mainly because we didn't have any at the time.  I did add a little onion powder, just for flavor.  It turned out awesome, and we've had it again since.  It was quick and easy and very tasty.  Definitely a new favorite.

I had leftover baked chicken and some leftover baked rice, so this took less than five minutes to make - and it was delicious. I am sure it is just as good made from scratch.

Soo good!  Instead of frozen veggies, I added diced onions and carrots and frozen peas.  After rice cooked, I added diced pork tenderloin, half can of drained bean sprouts and about a tablespoon of fresh grated ginger.  We added extra soy and Chinese hot mustard to our own servings.  Just as good the next day!

Again, simplicity is key!  This recipe is down right the most perfect stir fry made at home...closest to restruaunt style I have found yet and it was a huge hit in the family "chinese" food night!!  My healthy twist ~ low salt soy sauce, fresh brocolli pieces, instant brown rice and sprayed pan with cooking spray and scrambled egg whites.  The best fried rice I have ever made!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Not sure if I did something wrong but I followed the directions to the letter. I did omit the vegetables because we're not a fan. There just wasn't a lot of flavor.  Thank you for sharing but it's not something we'll have again.

This was so easy and surprisingly tasty for how quick and simple it was.  We used some canned mushrooms instead of the frozen veggies since we were making a veggie stir-fry to go with it.  It tastes great.  Also, we used a little over 1 1/3 C water mixed with dry buillion since we didn't have canned.  That turned out to be the right amount of moisture.

I always have trouble making rice, but this turned out perfectly.  I cooked it little longer than it called for and added chicken because my husband will not eat anything if doesn't have meat. This will be added to our weekly dinners.

I'm going to be cooking this recipe in my own style and I'll be doubling it.  I'm going to do the eggs.   Then I'm going to turn up the dial to above medium heat.  I'll stick in my olive oil and onions and garlic.  The recipe is finished when I add the rest of the ingredients once the onions and garlic are done.  I'll be adding basmatti rice instead of minute white rice, so it'll take a bit longer to cook.  I'll just use 8 cups of vegetable broth and 4 cups of white basmatti rice.   That's it, that's my change.

I used 2 eggs and rather than leaving the vegies long, I cut into smaller chunks. Delicious. I used long grain 'baked' rice. Vegies I left a bite in them before putting it together and that allowed the flavors to join in without overcooking the veggies.

I've made this twice now and I love it! I've been trying to eat a mostly vegetarian diet and this is a very tasty dish. I use a rice cooker and non-stick wok and it really makes a big difference in final texture and quality.  Fresh cut peppers and onions from the garden + whatever frozen veggies I have on hand.  I subbed sesame oil the first time and didn't have soy sauce the second time and used a stir fry sauce and both substitutions turned out great. My mother raises hens and the taste of fresh eggs in this recipe is incomparable. I cook for one but still make a large batch and can enjoy all week long or it freezes very well. Great dish for meal prepping!

This was an an easy to make recipe using what I already had in the kitchen. I used regular rice instead of Minute Rice. I didn't have frozen stir-fry vegetables so I cut up some onion and fresh carrots and sauted with garlic Then I tossed in some frozen corn (thawed) and added parsley towards the end of cooking with egg.. I used olive oil and no butter. Superb! My husband said it was "exceptional". 


This dish is now added to my arsenal of culinary wonders that I can cook. The simplicity of the recipe allows you to easily tweak it based upon your own tastes and available recipes.

I have been using min rice and making this for years and I happened by this recipe and read some reviews and I noticed a reviewer saying it is nothing like fried rice. That's because it's not, the frying step is completely skipped in this recipe. I prepare the rice per the box instructions (add frozen mixed veggies) then I put the rice in the freezer to chill for about 10 min. put about a tbsp of wok oil in a skillet ( regular oil or olive oil will also work) but you have to actually fry it for it to be fried rice..... add soy and egg at this time. I also throw a lil stir fry sauce in with the oil sometimes just do it right before you put the rice in or it will burn Makes all the difference!!!!!!

Made it basically following the recipe (only addition was a little pork I had in the fridge).  Kids loved it - even my usually picky 17 year old son.

This recipe is so delicious!  It's perfect just the way it is- the only changes I made was that I used one of my favorite brands of chicken bouillon to make my chicken broth, and I added a little bit of onion powder.  Other than that, I followed this recipe & everyone loved it!!  I definitely recommend this one!

My daughter loves this recipe. Easy simple and delicious.  I tend to use whatever veggies are on hand.  I love to use peas and sliced carrots.  I only use 2 eggs and scramble them in smart balance butter.  Make sure you use minute rice instead of the other quick rices.  I used the 10 minute boil in the bag rice and I had to cook it longer.

Great recipe! So easy. I changed the cooking method a little bit b/c I wanted a "real" fried rice. Instead of cooking the eggs first I waited until the rice was cooked, then cooked the eggs in with the rice as it was frying. It made it nice and sticky. Super tasty!

I loved this stir-fried rice recipe.  I did actually saute my rice in a skillet and I didn't use as much liquid.

My family loved this!  The only changes I made were to add a little more soy sauce and some teriyaki sauce I had on hand.  It has a very mild flavor that my children (13 & 7 years old) loved!

really great except im kinda new to cooking and didnt know that normal rice is different from minute rice and had to add loads of water in the end. so i suggest cooking rice first then doing everything else as suggested.

This recipe was delicious, but I was left with the rice and a whole lot of chicken broth that was unnecessary. I had to drain the excess broth, but the remaining fried rice was amazing!

This was really good!  I did not have white Minute Rice so I made it with the brown.  I also had a little left-over chicken that i added.  It was quick and easy!

This was easy and surprisingly great!!  I didn't have a lot of hope because it seemed a little 'dull' but boy was I wrong!
