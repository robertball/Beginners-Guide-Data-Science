Very easy and very good! I used a 14.5 oz. can of fire roasted tomatoes vs. the petite diced and added, 2 tsp. of cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp. of salt, and 1/2 tsp. of sugar. I must say that a bunch of fresh cilanto can be a bit subjective and in my opinion "overkill" so add it to suit your tastes. I only added a couple of Tbsp. chopped. I put everything into my mini food processor and let it go....  then put it in the fridge for a couple of hours to let the flavors blend and it went great with warm tortilla chips!

This is called a blended salsa, not a salsa fresca with chunks. Some places do serve this style of salsa as opposed to the fresher kind. My teenagers and their friends love this style of salsa. Personally, I added more heat with fresh jalapeno peppers (sometimes canned works in a pinch) instead of pickled, and increased the garlic. Made the family happy! Thanks for a nice, basic blended salsa recipe!

We like this...with conditions. Cilantro is a very overpowering flavor, and an entire bunch of it...way too much. Other than that, I think this could be a really great salsa.

AWESOME! I cant get enough of this salsa and it reminds me of the mexican restaurant salsas (due to the cilantro taste). I added alot more peppers because I like the spice but either way, you cannot go wrong!

I loved this recipe!  Way too easy (even for me!)  I didn't have the exact diced tomatoes the recipe called for, I used 2 - 14.5 oz cans of Rotel Diced with Cilantro and Lime Juice and 1 - 14.5 oz can of Diced with Green Chiles.  Since they gave it the Cilantro and the Lime Juice, I didn't need to add those two ingredients.  I added 1/2 chopped onion (I love ONION!) and garlic and had no jalapenos so those were omitted....but end result was YUMMY!  I will definately be using this from here out...no more jar salsa!

This salsa tastes like the salsa at my local Mexican restaurant.  The flavors aren't as complex as some of my other salsas, but it is very palatable and incredibly easy and quick to make.

I make at least one batch of this per week, especially in the summer. It's very easy,  inexpensive, and everyone loves it. I do not add the extra jalapenos per our taste. I also salt pretty well with kosher salt. Always a big hit at get togethers.
