This is a great recipe. Very tasty! However, I would make some changes to it. I would eliminate the salt because salt can be added at the table as necessary. When you cook the onions I would add 1 or 2 cloves of garlic for more flavor. Also, I found that this dish is really great with mashed potatoes but there was not enough gravy for 4 servings over the hamburger and also the potatoes. I would increase the beef broth to two cups and add more green peppers and onions. Slightly increase the nutmeg and thyme also. The recipe said 30 minutes and I had the meal on the table in 30 minutes. One of the better recipes I have tried here.

Wow, these are arguably the best burgers my wife and I have ever had, and I'm not a big burger fan. The gravy is perfect in place of the typical condiments, a fantastic flavor. I added some garlic powder the meat mix and then sauteed mushrooms, adding them to the gravy w/ peppers after the patties were done cooking...DELICIOUS! Excellent with swiss cheese on top. Kudos on this...

take the recipe to a burger competition!

This is definately the best skillet-cooked burger recipe I've had had. I followed the recipe primarily except for omitting the salt, pouring in a full can of beef broth to increase the  sauce, and adding some provolone cheese at the end. The sauce was fantastic, with a great flavor. The down side: my husband and I found the burgers a little bland, because almost all the seasonings were in the sauce, rather than the burger. I think that for next time, my recommendation would be to sprinkle some of the thyme on each side of the burgers during the browning stage, along with some other seasonings, such as pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. I will be making this again in the future.

This was okay and the meatballs themselves tasted fine but seemed very bland. Their only flavor was the nutmeg. The sauce was dominated by the green pepper taste though and I couldn't really taste the thyme. This made a filling hot meal, but wasn't something I would make again. It presents well on a plate and looks very appetizing. Thanks, I enjoyed trying your recipe.
