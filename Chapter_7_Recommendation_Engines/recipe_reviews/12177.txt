This recipe in itself deserves 4 stars, however, when tweaked a bit, the results are 10 stars!  I used 4 cups of strawberries (roughly a pound and a half) and 4 cups of rhubarb (5 long stalks), 5 Tbsp flour and 3/4 cup of sugar.  I probably could have used even less sugar.  Bottom line is, if your strawberries are fresh and ripe, you really don't need that much sugar.  I will likely try 1/2 cup next time.  Then I poured the fruit mixture into a 10 x 15 1/2 bar pan.  I did not adjust the topping-- I made as the recipe called for and there was more than enough to cover the top.  I baked for the same amount of time and at the same temp and it came out perfect!  (just be sure to put aluminum foil down in your oven because the juices run over the side of the bar pan!) This recipe will easily serve 12 and is absolutely the perfect combination of sweetness, tartness and crunchiness.  Great summer recipe!

This is an excellent recipe - easy, fast and very good.  I used a larger (10 X 14) dish and increased the fruit to about 5 cups for each.  I could have used even more.  I used slightly less than 1 c. white sugar and 4-5 tbs of flour for the fruit.  I also added the zest of one juicing orange, a teaspoon of cinnamon and a few grates of nutmeg - all of which made a big impact on the taste.  For the topping, I made the amount noted in the recipe, but did not use it all - and that was on a significantly bigger batch. Just use what looks right.  I did not change the baking time.  Good luck!

Proportions are odd.  Much too much flour & butter in the topping and not
enough fruit in the filling.  Topping is a bit bland so I added spices & nuts.
Also, three tablespoons of flour in the filling yields a consistency that was gluey
even with twice as many strawberries as called for.  I haven't tried with the one 
tablespoon I'm suggesting yet but I'm guessing based upon other recipes that 
this will work better.
Here is what I came up with:

Filling:
3 cups rhubarb
2-3 cups strawberries
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon flour

Topping:
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup flour
6 tablespoons butter
1 cup rolled oats
1/8 tsp. cinnamon
dash each nutmeg & ground clove
handful of favorite nut is optional (I like pecans myself)

I'm rating this 5-stars even though there's twice as much topping as you need!  I can't imagine using all that is called for. I think I probably only used half of it!  I asked Hubs to taste and review this.  "Is it too sweet?" I asked him. "No," he replied, "It's too good."  I can always tell with him when something I make sets itself apart from others.  This recipe is one of those times.  It's quite sweet, that's for sure, but then we didn't have it with whipped cream or ice cream.  (That's because we ate spoonfuls of it right out of the baking dish while it was still warm) I'm sure it would be even better with the ice cream or whipped cream.  The buttery, crunchy oat topping is just perfect  - except that there's far too much of it!  Delicious dessert, just reduce the amount of topping or do what I did and use the extra to top muffins!

DELICIOUS!!!!! At 18 years old, I'm a pretty young baker...but I KNOW that this is the best of the best =)! This was SOOOOOO WONDERFUL!!!! My dad has been a strawberry-rhubarb lover his whole life, and in his childhood his mother would make strawberry-rhubarb desserts for him. He told me that this was the BEST ONE HE HAS EVER HAD!! I did change the recipe a little... I added 4 cups rhubarb, 3 cups strawberry...then in the topping I decreased the flour and brown sugar to 3/4 cup and the butter to 7 TBL. I also added about 1/2 tea cinnamon. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY!!!

Made this last nite & ate waaay tooo much of it!! No problems with halving the topping & using an 8x8 pan.  Totally awesome!
To make things easier, use your kitchen shears to dice/chop the rhubarb after slicing the stalks lengthwise.  One large stalk yields about 1 cup.  Also, 1 pound of strawberries will be just over the 3 cups needed for the recipe.  Looking forward to trying it out with some apples next time!

This was really good.  I used splenda instead of white sugar and sugartwin's brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar to limit the carbs.  No way anyone could tell and it probably took the carbs from 37 to 10 per serving.  I will make this again, it was fabulous.

I thought this was delicious and apparently so did the 14 guests we had this evening; all but one little smidge is left. :-) I used thawed rhubarb from my garden from last season; so even though there were 4 cups, it didn't look like 4 as the fruit thawed, so I added 2-3 extra cups of thawed rhubarb.  Used 1 pound of strawberries which equalled 3 cups.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4c and added a sprinkling of sliced almonds to the topping; did everything else as written.  This was so delicious; with the sweetness of the strawberries, it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart for us!  Served warm with Vanilla Ice Cream V (from this website).  Thank you for the great recipe, Michelle.

Very yummy!  Don't cheat yourself by cutting the topping - double the fruit instead.  YUM!  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the topping.

If you like the rhubarb-strawberry combination, this is a keeper. This is a very easy, very delicious recipe. I used 3 cups of strawberries and 3 cups of rhubarb and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Had to make it twice in the first week--it was so good.

The sweetness of the strawberries really balance out the tart rhubarb.  If rhubarb isn't in season, frozen works just fine.

As  fruit (except rhubarb) in Alaska is shipped and not vine ripened, the sugar content was perfect but I too, will increase the fruit to 4C each for the amount of topping. After serving it last night to some friends they requested it for their barbeque tonight! Also, I like to thicken my fruit mixes on the stovetop before assembling for baking.

Made this twice in the last week and a half and it is awesome!!  I drastically reduced the sugar because I like my rhubarb tart and delicious.  Only 1/3 to 1/2 cup in the crumble and a lite sprinkle on the filling.  I also added nutmeg, cinnamon, sliced almond, and walnut pieces to the crumble and it really added some nice undertones to the flavor.  serve alone or with vanilla ice cream. great either way.

Read reviews and took the advice of many: Used 5 C strawberries, 4 1/2 C rhubarb and 5 Tbs. flour.  Followed the rest of the recipie as is.  Wonderful and will make again.  All my guests raved about it!  Thanks for sharing!

Far, far, FAR too much sugar.  I halved it, and it was delicious.  Why use a tart ingredient if you're going to drench it in sugar to the point you can't taste it?

I'm not the hugest fan of rhubarb, but even I loved this recipe. I didn't measure out the fruit in cups; just used 3 good-sized stalks of rhubarb and a 1-pound container of strawberries. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and added an extra TBSP of flour, because I have had major problems in the past with overly-runny rhubarb pies. I tossed the fruit in the flour/sugar and let it sit while I made the topping, to draw some of the juices out. Did not change the proportions of the topping. I split the recipe between two 9-inch pie pans and cooked for an extra 15 minutes, until the topping was nice and crisp! Excellent consistency, didn't run at all and I loved the buttery topping!

This was a very good recipe.  I halved the topping part and that was still more than enough.  I used 3 c rhubarb, fresh strawberries, and 2 c blueberries and it was delish!  I changed the flour to corn starch and also decreased the amount of white sugar to 1/2c.  I will make again!

Yummy!! I substituted the strawberries with 2 bags of frozen cherries. Also, I used 2 bags of frozen rhubarb. This was soooo good. I also followed others advice about adding 4 Tbsp of flour to fruit mixture. Stirring it in with the sugar and fruit before put on the topping.

This is a yummy recipe but needs a few changes. I cooked it at 350 for only about 30 minutes and it was bubbling and browned. Also added more fruit and a little more flour to thicken it. I wouldn't try to get 18 serving out of it unless those you are serving have teeny tiny appetites, maybe 9-12 servings is more accurate.

I had some strawberries and rhubarb in the freezer that needed to be used up. I decided that today was the day I was going to find a recipe so I could finally get these out of my freezer. I didn't have any brown sugar on hand so I subbed that out for white. My house had the most heavenly smell when this was baking in the oven. Once baked, it presented well. It looked nice enough that I would not hesitate to make this for a pot luck or some such event. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream and let me tell you, it was perfect. My partner described it as being "delightful" and said he could eat a large quantity of it. It's always a good sign when he says that as he's quite a picky eater. I was very happy with the outcome of this dessert and will most definitely make it again in the future.

Absolutely delicious!

I did not change one thing in making this recipe and it turned out amazing!  I was a little worried about the quantity of flour it asks for however opted to leave it as is to see how it would turn out which was a very good decision.  I do not think this recipe made too much crumble topping at all.  In my opinion the proportions were actually perfect.  The strawberry/rhubarb combo makes a lot more liquid than an apple crumple therefore I think the crumble balances it out nicely.  Regardless, if you find there is too much topping, it freezes great!

I'm already craving more.

I cut this down to nine servings so it would fit a 8x8 square baking pan. I did increase the fruit to almost two cups each (this was after seeing that three cups of chopped fruit just wasn't enough to cover the bottom of my pan and come up a bit) and added a tsp. of vanilla and a tbsp. of lemon juice to the fruit mixture. I used white sugar for the streusel because that's all I had and it was just as pretty as I would have made it with brown sugar. I did try a small bite and thought that there was a little too much flour in the fruit. My kids and husband thought it was great, especially with a little low-fat frozen yogurt on top.

This was the perfect recipe for newbie bakers and rhubarb eaters. Simple to make and Yummmy!!!!!!!! I took the advice of others and bumped up the quanities of fruit. The other change I made was added 1/2 cup each of ground roasted pecans and shredded sweetend coconut. This makes a very yummy crisp topping that can work with any fruit crisp or pie. It can also be kept for a few weeks in the fridge if you have too much.

Very good, but only right out of the oven. 
As it sits the "crunchy" topping turns to mush!

This is delicious. After reading reviews I doubled the recipe and used a 9x12 pan. Also added chopped walnuts to the topping. I will make this again and again.

As other reviewers suggested, I only used about 3/4 c. of suger, my strawberries were from a strawberry stand and already very sweet.  I had extra rhubarb, so the amount of the strawberries and rhubard were about 5 c. each, and the 3/4 c. of suger were perfect.  I didn't change the amount of topping, it was perfect (it makes alot). I'd say that about 6 Tbls of flour is what I used for the filling.  The mixture of sweet and tart was soooo yummy!  I'm going to add rhubarb to my vegetable garden next year and make this often!

Very good! Can't beat the tartness of rhubarb combined with the sweetness of strawberry. The only thing I would change would be the amount of sugar in the fruit mixture. I reduced it to 3/4 cup and it was still a little too sweet; almost like strawberry jam. You also want to be sure to use 3 cups of rhubarb--don't skimp because you are tired of chopping rhubarb like I did! All in all, it is very good. A keeper for sure!

Easy to follow recipe. We greatly enjoyed the flavors. I used frozen rhubarb and frozen strawberries as we didn't have fresh. To help quicken the defrosting I thawed them out by rinsing them in room temp water and draining them. I was skeptical of adding the flour to the fruit mix but it helped to thicken the fruit juices up so you don't have to cook it forever. I took some of the others' suggestions and for the crunch topping and we added 1/4 cup walnuts, 1tsp cinnammon, dash nutmeg, and dash cloves. I'm very glad we did as it needed the extra spice to make it a comfort food :) This is definetly going to be made again in my kitchen and I can't wait to bring it to my work potluck next month. Althought next time I make it I think I'll try adding a dash of ground ginger.

Everyone in the house loved it!!!!  I usually find rhubarb/strawberry recipes too sweet. this one was great.  I read the other reviews before I made it and I did double the fruit and added a little more brown sugar to the topping.  Thanks alot for sharing this fab. recipe.

This was awesome! I made it for company and everyone practically licked their plates clean (we served it with vanilla ice cream). We used rhubarb from our backyard and fresh strawberies. I did add almost 2 more cups of strawberries and a little more rhubarb because of what others said in the other reviews. Also cut down on the flour that was mixed in with the fruit and with the topping.

I made this recipe with slight alterations taken from both TRindell and ROOTZOO - I used the 4 cups of strawberries with a couple more tablespoons of flour in the fruit mixture and then I added 1 tbsp of cinnamon and a half tbsp of nutmeg to the crisp. I also used the entire amount of topping from the original recipe because the crispy crust is my favorite part! Delicious recipe - definitely going into the vault.

For me, this recipe was just so-so. I felt that the proportion of fruit vs: topping just wasn't right... there was FAR too much topping. I much prefer the recipe for Rhubarb-Raspberry Crunch submitted by VSCOLE. I have used it many times, substituting the raspberries for strawberries, apples and peaches and the overall result is far superior in my opinion.

Tried this tonight, and it is a very nice recipe.  I thought there might be too much sugar, but it works well with the tartness of the rhubarb.  My husband said it was one of the best crisps he's had.  Also, very easy to make.  Success!

Yummy! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I altered the recipe a bit after reading other reviews. I only put in half of the sugar that the recipe called for. I wanted to ensure I tasted the rhubarb. It worked. Putting in less sugar gave the perfect the perfect balance of sweet and tangy flavors. This recipe is a keeper!

I used more fruit and only 1/2 cup sugar in the fruit and some lemon peel and a touch of cinnamon. I used 1/2 cup butter in the crumbs and about 1/2 cup br sugar and 1 cup flour and a bit of cinnamon. It was delicious! You may need more sugar depending on your fruit, but we hate sweet things and if you serve it hot, it always tastes sweeter than when it's cold.

Made this recipe to use up some rhubarb given by a friend.  Crunch turned out good, I would have liked the topping to turn out crunchier, could of been something done by me and not the recipe itself.

This was DELICIOUS! I had double the filling (6 cups rhubarb and 6 cups strawberries) and filled a 9x13 no problem. The crust was the perfect amount to give it a thick layer. It was watery, which is the reason for four stars. I talked it over with my mom and she suggested tapioca, as did some other reviewers. I would like to try this again with the tapioca! Hopefully it will be a fiver.

Followed PHASION's advice and cut the topping in half and used an 8x8 pan instead.  It was awesome!  Also added a little cinnamon to the topping as well.  Good stuff!

This is SO good!! I had made rhubarb crisp before but never with strawberries in it. They take it to a whole new level! You mostly just taste the strawberries. The only thing I did different was I thought a whole cup of butter was a bit much so I reduced it to one stick. Didn't reduce the other ingredients in the topping but I probably will next time just by a little. Wonderful!

This came out wonderfully! Super simple and easy to make, this is a great summer crowd-pleaser. I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought it was the perfect ratio of fruit to crunchy topping. I served it warmed up with vanilla ice cream at a BBQ, and people were raving about it. I am adding this to my stockpile of summer dessert recipes. Notes: it took the better part of an hour for the top to become crisp and "done." Also, make sure you put a lined baking sheet below your pan in case the fruit bubbles up and over; mine didn't, but depending on how much fruit you use, it very well could.

I have made this twice this week, the first time I did add 4 cups of both strawberry and rhubard, was a bit runny but still tasted really nice. The 2nd time I used tapioca(let sit mixed in fruit for about 15 mins) instead of flour and was not runny at all. 
Husband is real rhubarb fan and really liked this. Serve with either ice cream or whip cream...

This was really good, but I DOUBLED the fruit, did not double the other ingredients, (but used 4T of flour, and I think the 3 would have been fine, I like my fruit crunch a little more "saucey") and it was really good. I would actually prefered even more fruit and will do that next time. I added cinnamon into the topping, and used 3/4 cup of the butter. I used splenda brown sugar as well so that it EQUALED 1c. (you use 1/2 of the splenda that you would use with regular brown sugar)  Oh I made my topping in my food processor.. so easy!

Delicious and I'm not even a rhubarb lover!  The strawberries really make this dessert - didn't even need ice cream or whipped cream for a topping.  I used a container of frozen strawberries instead of fresh.  Perfect - a keeper recipe.

I gave this recipe 5 stars only cause 6 wasn't an option! I used fresh rhubarb from the garden and fresh berries and I ate some fresh from the oven. I swear it is one of the most delicious desserts I've ever made. The tart rhubarb and sweet strawberries went perfectly with the soft, yet crunchy, topping. I'm going to try it with raspberries this time! Amazing recipe!

I read some are having a problem with the rhubarb tasting bitter; peel the rhubarb first because that bitterness comes from the rhubarb's skin.

This is one of my family's favorite summer recipes.  I have taken some suggestions from others- I use 4 cups of each fruit, use tapioca instead of flour mixed in with the fruit, cut the topping amount in half, add some nutmeg to the fruit, and add some nutmeg and cinnamon to the topping.

I would highly suggest NOT using previously frozen fruit in this recipe. It was extremely runny. Tasted good though, although I did follow variations mentioned by other reviewers. Use 4 cups each fruit.

This was very good!  The only things I changed were:  Halved the recipe to make an 8x8 but used almost as much strawberries and rhubarb as for a full recipe, and cut the butter and sugar down in the topping per other reviews.  I will definitely be making this again next spring!

I think the amount the "crumble topping" this recipe makes is a personal preference.  As for myself, I like a lot of that.  This recipe is one sided though, either 1/2 the ingredients for the topping or increase the amount of fruit.  Either way, you will love this dish.  It's very good.

I went against every instinct of my baking experience to make this dessert.  It is too sweet and too fatty.  The natural sweetness of the fruit was masked (overwhelmed) by the sugar.  I also found the crunch texture cookie-like, not at all like a true crumble. I had even increased the amount of fruit by 1/3 and still the sugar was too much. I think instead of modifying this recipe I would recommend using another recipe all together!

Excellent and easy recipe.  I have made this three times in the last ten days for family and friends and have received many compliments and requests for the recipe.  The only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the crisp as suggest previously.  Serve this with ice cream for a wonderful, memorable dessert.

I made this without any alterations.  It looked like there was too much topping when I was making it, but once it was all done, it was just right.  Most crunch recipes don't have the right topping to filling ratio.  I do think the topping would have benefitted from some cinnamon or something to give it a little more flavor.  There was enough sugar so the rhubarb wasn't tart at all, which I was glad about.  One quart of strawberries was almost exactly 3 cups.  I'd make this again with a slight tweaking of the topping for some extra flavor.

love it!  instead of halving the topping, just refrigerate the remainder and use the next time you make a crisp, i do this all the time at work, it is a great time saver!

We found this excellent, I cut the sugar by 1/4 both the white and the brown.  It was still plenty sweet.  I also used Quick Cook Tapioca instead of the flour for thickening.  We just like the flavor and texture better.  GREAT RECIPE!  We love strawberries and Rhubarb.

We loved this!  I had enough rhubarb, but only had 2 1/2 cups strawberries so I added 1/2 cup fresh bluberries.  I think it made this dessert even more interesting in taste and appearance.  Although 1 cup of butter is A LOT, I used it and, of course, that made it even more special.  I will make this one again!

My fiancée who hates rhubarb looked like he was going to cry after I told him the next morning that I took the leftovers with me to work (so we didn't consume all the calories). I used less sugar than what was called for and rhubarb out of the garden. Wouldn't change a thing

This was sooo delicious.  I used closer to 4 cups of strawberries - to use up what I had; For the topping I reduced the flour to 1 cup kept everything else the same except added a generous teaspoon of cinnamon.  We loved this recipe, the perfect combo of tart and sweet.  I always make my 'crunch' recipes in a deep casserole dish, not a baking pan; this one used the large French White dish and it was perfect.  No complaints about too much topping from us - that's what makes a crunch a crunch!

I thought this was simple and delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and made in an 8x8 square pan.  Used 3 cups rhubarb and 1 cup strawberries since that is what I had in the garden that day.  Kept the topping amounts the same and did not feel like it was too much at all.  Just cut the sugar down a bit in the fruit. Yum!

Fresh stawberries, fresh rhubarb......what a delicious combination.  I made this as written, only cutting the white sugar down to 1/2 cup because we like the rhubarb tart.  The strawberries were so sweet that you could not even tell the sugar was cut back.  I liked it best still warm with a small scoop of ice cream.  My husband on the other hand liked it warm with ice cream, cold for breakfast, in his lunch and also after dinner.  He LOVED this recipe and finished most of the pan himself!  This will be made again and again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Amazing! Simple and delicious! I would suggest making fruit a little chunkier. The diced rhubarb just disappears and has no consistancy. Same with strawberries, cut them a bit thicker. Yum, yum! This is so easy to prepare and it a no-fail recipe. This will go right into my cookbook!

Delicious! I did add a little more rolled oats and a little vanilla to the topping, but I am sure it still would have been delicious without the additions. I brought it to a dinner party and everyone loved it.

Yum, Yum, Yum!! Followed alot of the other reviews and added less sugar to the fruit, added a little more flour to the fruit and a dash of cinnamon as well - the topping was fabulous and even my husband who doesn't care for fruit desserts gobbled this up! Thanks for the keeper!

I added mixed berries (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries) instead of just strawberries.  My family loved it. Great topping!!!

I made this last night and followed the recipe to a T.  It was good, but my batch needed that whole 1 Cup of sugar in the strawberry rhubarb mix and the 1 Cup of brown sugar in the crumble topping.  My fruit mixture was not overly sweet, in fact, I might add a touch more sugar next time as mine was a little tart.  I had no issues with the topping, but wondering if some reviewers only used 1 stick instead of 2 sticks of butter as it called for 1 Cup.  This makes a huge portion so make sure you have lots of people to eat it.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent!  Both of my roommates hate rhubarb, but they liked it a lot.  The recipe is super sweet so I would cut down on the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  Eat with ice cream for the perfect dessert!

Just prepared this recipe and very good starter. I doubled the strawberries and rhubarb. Added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, dash of salt, 2 T lemon juice and few grates of nutmeg. Also added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to topping.

Disappointing.  Too much topping and you had to look for the strawberry and  rhubarb filling.  Not edible.

This was really good! I had never cooked with rhubarb before and didnt really know what to expect, but this turned out great! I used 3/4 C sugar in the fruit, and accidentally made a bit more topping than was called for. This threw off the fruit/crisp ratio slightly, so next time I will use more fruit :-)

Also, added a few dashes of ground nutmeg and cinnamon to the topping and melted the butter instead of trying to "cut" it into the topping mixture. A keeper.

This would have been a 5 star had it just been a Rhubarb Crisp but when you add those strawberries you need to adjust the sugar. I like to follow recipe as written first time then adjust for my taste. I made 2 9x9 but did add more fruit to fill 2C rhubarb 2C strawberries per 9x9 made one for friends birthday next time will cut back sugar or use larger ratio of rhubarb, maybe no sugar in fruit mixture and keep topping the same.

Yum!  I really liked the topping on this.  I only used 3/4 cup of the white sugar, as I prefer my rhubarb on the tart side, and the strawberries I had were pretty sweet.

This was a huge hit this 4th of July! I added two more cups of the strawberries and the rhubarb. Also used wheat flour and splenda sugars and nobody had a clue.

Used 4 cups of each fruit, 1/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup sugar.  Also, to topping added a pinch of salt and a few dashes of cinnamon.  You will be surprised how much flavor those additions provide.

Upon making this a second time I followed the recipe except for omitting the strawberries, doubled the rhubarb portion and adding 1.5 ounces of strawberry jello instead.  The topping is so buttery and crunchy, THE BEST!!!

I am not a fan of rhubarb, but I got some with my CSA and had to find something to make with it. I am so glad I found this recipe because I didn't want to make pie. The texture of the oat topping was a welcome change from boring old pie crust, and such a nice compliment to the fruit layer. I made it exactly as written and it was great. Thank you Michelle!

Fantastic!  Didn't change a thing except I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh.  The crunchy topping is very thick, but I personally like that.

I made this twice.  The first time I made it exactly as written and it was extremely tart.  I HAD to have ice cream with it for it to be even remotely edible for me.  The second time I made it all the same except using 3 parts strawberries and 1 part rhubarb and it was much better.  I took it to a BBQ and it was a huge hit!

Very generic (overly sweet) with even extra fruit added. There are much better things to do with rhubarb if you ask me. The topping is overbearing. If you're a real rhubarb lover you might want to try something else.

I made a 9x9 pan of this recipe by using the calculator to make 9 servings and I made a huge mistake. I should have made the full 9x13 pan b/c this was THE best recipe EVER!!  I have never had anything this good homemade, store bought, grandma made ever.  Use and use again.  For those who love Strawberry and rhubarb, make this. It's easy and it's wonderful!!  Heaven in a pan!!  Thank you to the inventor. You made my day!!

This was really good!  Although, I put more strawberries and rhubarb than what it called for because I picked WAY too much rhubarb out of my garden and had to improvise!  The topping was great too!  It didn't stay in my refrigerator long!!!

I followed the recipe just as it read and my whole family loved this!  We were craving something strawbery rhubarb but I didn't want to make a pie crust.  This is so much better than a pie!  I will also use this recipe in place of my peach cobbler recipe from now on.  The topping would be wonderful on any kind of fruit.

I divided the recipe in 2, baked it in a 8*8 square dish, and added a bit of cinnamon to the topping. This aside, I didn't change a thing and my husband loved it! Thanks!

This had wonderful flavor, and the topping was perfect.  I only had half the rhubarb called for, so made up the difference by adding sliced apples.  Yum!

Great recipe - I had family members begging for the recipe.  However, I would add some cinammon to the crumble portion just to spice it up!

HOLY COW!!!!!!  I JUST MIGHT EAT THE WHOLE PAN!!!  The only thing I changed about this recipe was adding 4 cups of strawberries and 4 cups of rhubarb.  That was only because I had extra.  I thought the toping was wonderful and would not change a thing about this recipe!  Kids love it, still trying to make my husband give it a try ;)  He'll like it too I'm sure though.  SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!

I made this dessert last night with frozen rhubarb, it turned out great.  I love the gooey juice after the strawberry/rhubarb was cooked, the flavor is so clean once you scoop it in your mouth.  I'm glad I took the advice of the previous viewer, I used 4 cups of strawberries and 4 cups of rhubarb, and added some honey and more flour to the fruit mixture, the amount is just right for the whole dessert.

I really enjoyed this recipe a lot, and I used last years frozen strawberries which were slightly freezer burned and it worked out great!  However, be careful when you scale this recipe... the original measurements are in the recipe itself so it can be confusing.  Also, be sure to make extra because these portions are pretty small.

Very very good, I have made this twice in less than 24 hours.  The 2nd time I made it I added a handful of butterscotch/chocolate chips to the top, it was great both ways.  I did use 4 cups of rhubarb and 4 cups of strawberrries.

Delicious, had only one stalk of rhubarb, which was a half cup, and no strawberries, so i substituted the missing fruit with raspberries.

Loved the recipe. Tweeked it by adding 2 cups of blueberries, 1 cup of strawberries, with the 3 cups of rhubarb.  Great with ice cream.  I will make it again to serve at the next family gathering. Two thumbs up. - Helene

Half of the topping recipe was plenty as this fit in a 10x7 pan.   Had made previously with full amount and felt like we were eating more topping than fruit.  As well, since my daughter is GF the GF flour can get too gritty in large amounts.

This is perfect, easy, can feed a lot of the neighborhood and will get five stars at the State Fair with vanilla ice cream on top. This is better than pie (and easier).

I made this last night. Since some other reviewers mentioned issues with the crunchy topping, I used the topping from Apple Crisp II (times 1.5%) since I know that one works and I love it. This is delicious! It didn't come out of the oven until after my kids were in bed but when I was putting some into a container this morning to bring to work with me, I gave my 8 year old a taste and her eyes just about popped out of her head. Darn it, I guess I will have to share with them. I must plant some rhubarb next spring so we can enjoy this often. Thank you, Michelle. My waistline may not thank you but my taste buds surely do!

I'm 13 and I'm the baker in the house and the oven is about to start beeping. So far i messed up once. I used an eletic mixer instead of a pastery mixer. My bad. I'm using the leftover topping for a larg cookie for my dad. 5 stars for this recipe.

This recipe is too sweet.  It could probably handle 2 more cups of fruit (don't add anymore sugar or flour).  The topping is very sweet as well... next time I will cut the sugar in half and add some cinnamon & nutmeg.  The topping as written here is a little bland.  There is a lot of the topping as well... increasing the fruit might help with that.

My 12 year old daughter made this with rhubarb & strawberries that thawed in the freezer after being left open for the night! She doubled the recipe and it was a success. We had visitors that same evening and some people asked to take some of the leftovers.

I made this super easy dessert last week and it was scrumptious! I cut the recipe: strawberries, rhubarb and cornstarch and water by 1/3, the white sugar and topping ingredients by 1/2. I baked it in a 9x11" pan. It was more than enough for 6 people when served with vanilla ice cream.

This is very good. I increased fruit to 4 - 5 C. each as recommended. *However*, there was something missing with the fruit filling; it was too bland. I recommend adding 1/4 C. white sugar and 1 Tblspn lemon juice to the fruit instead of flour. :)

What a fantastic use for rhubarb!  I used 1/2 spelt flour, cut down on the butter and used coconut oil (solidified) to make up for the butter. Next time I make it, I will cut down on the sugar, probably by 1/2.  This disappeared so quickly I may be making it again very soon!

Super!  Followed about exactly (didn't measure my fruit, just had 1# berries and 5 stalks rhubarb), and it's beautiful!  Sometimes my streusel topping don't get crunchy, but this one turned out perfect!

My husband is crazy about strawberries, I'm a crisp-gal, and my daughter will do anything for "ice" (cream).  I made this for Mother's Day and of course we all loved it.  It was hard, but I forced myself to use all the butter and sugar the recipe called for.  I'm sure I could have cut back on both, but this is a once-in-a-while treat, right?  I'm glad to have found this recipe for a future special occasion!

A general recommendation: Like a lot of people, we used five cups of both strawberries and rhubarb. I can't imagine only using three of each, so don't. We also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1/8 nutmeg to the fruit, which gave the fruit a little more kick. Truly excellent, easy recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and I think it had too much flour.  Besides that it was very good, but next time I will only use 3/4 cup flour and maybe even increase the butter a little.

I am the only one in the family who will eat fruit desserts (I know CRAZY kids!) so I made an 8 x 8 pan and cut the crunch mixture in half.  Kept the fruit mixture the same amount.  It turned out perfect although I might add some spice to the mixture next time.  Yummy and just what I was hoping for!

I only had frozen rhubarb and strawberries, made double the quantity  so there was lots of lovely crumble and I froze some portions.  When I make it again I will use more rhubarb than strawberries as it was a wee bit sweet for my taste but  a really good recipe.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great. (I halved the ingredients bc it was too much for 2 people.) On the flip side, it was a bit to sweet for me. Next time I will reduce the sugar that is mixed in with the berries.

Really really loved this recipe.  Perfect mix of sweet/tart, and the topping works really well.  I found it had to cook a little longer than suggested to get the top crunchy though.   Have made several time in the last few weeks as a last minute desert.

I followed the recipe and there was three times the amount of crust as the strawberry rhubarb mix. My dad seemed to like it but the rest of my family didn't want another bite of the thing...it looked delicious but I couldn't eat it because its not gluten free..

We love to have these on hand for summer gathering. Just store the fruit filling in a separate bag from the crumb topping, freeze and thaw the day before you're ready to assemble. We use less butter and more oats and add a hint of cinnamon to the topping too. Delicious!

I used all strawberris and this turned out wonderful.  It did not thicken like I wanted it too so next time I'll add cornstarch to the strawberries.  The taste is great.

Very tasty.  Took others advice and decreased the white sugar.  I also added an extra 1 cup of each fruit.  Made extra of the topping because my family likes it thick.  I Definately would make this again.  Its easy and quick to prepare.

I took the advice of many reviewers and increased the fruit to 4 cups of each.  I also decreased the white sugar to 3/4 cup and used 5 tbsp of flour with the fruit.  The topping I didn't change at all.  My husband claims he hates Rhubarb but he LOVED this.  It was perfect.

I only had 2 cups of rhubarb, so I adjusted the recipe by 1/3 and put in a 9x9 pan for 35 minutes.  It was delicious and a big hit with my husband who loves strawberry-rhubarb pie.  Will definitely make again using the correct amounts.

Great recipe with a few tweaks: use more fruit, cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup and also add 1/2 cup of walnuts or pecans chopped or ground into the topping (can add directly to food processor).

This is a great recipe! I made it exactly as it said and I also made a separate batch for my husband with Celiac disease. I used corn Chex chopped with a Pampered Chef food chopper as a substitute for the flour and oats in the recipe! He's very happy with the result!

This was so easy and fast to make. It tasted amazing and my guests raved about it. :) Loved it. I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and it was perfect. However, it does take more than 15 min of prep time if you have to cut up your berries & rhubarb!!

Delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar (I used 3/4 c).  I may even use less next time.  For the crumb topping, I made half of what the recipe called for, as others had suggested, but I needed to make the other half of the recipe to get a nice crumb layer in a 9x13 pan.  So if you're going to use a 9x13 pan, definitely make the whole recipe of crumb topping.

Delicious.  I did double the filling and cooked it for an additional ten minutes.  I think next time I would add just a bit less sugar.  It was "in your face" sweet.

very delish!!! this is definitly a keeper ... very easy ... love, love, love EASY!  made a few substituions, like 1/2 white flour for whole wheat, 1/2 white sugar for Splenda, used Splenda-blended brown sugar, Olivio instead of butter, and increased fruit to 4 cups ... 2nd time, only made changes to topping: added 1C chopped Pecans, increased Oats by 1/4 cup, used unsalted butter; next time w/follow same adjustments, except will decrease brown sugar to 3/4 cup and w/probably add 1/2 tsp salt (see photos #21 and #22); by patidee

I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and used 4 cups each of strawberries and rhubarb.  I followed the suggestion of a fellow reviewer and also added the zest of 1 orange, a few grates of nutmeg, and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the filling along with 5 tbsp of flour instead of 3.  Overall I thought the recipe was just ok.  It tasted pretty tart, so maybe I would stick to the original 1 cup of sugar next time.  I used all of the topping for a 9 x 13 pan, which seems to be enough...maybe I could have used a little less but I don't think it's 2 times more than needed as some other reviewers suggested.

This turned out fabulous! I did up the fruit to 4 cups of each and only did 3/4 cup of sugar in the fruit mixture. Everything else stayed the same and it turned out wonderful! I should add that I only used about 3/4 of the total topping and it was the perfect amount.

I made 1/3 of this recipe to use up some strawberries.  I used all strawberries, and no rhubarb.  For my mini version I used probably 3 cups total of strawberries due to the reviewers who said there wasn’t enough fruit.  I also gathered from the reviewers that this makes way too much topping, so I cut the amount in half.  I also halved the sugar and flour that’s mixed with the berries.  I baked mine for about 35 minutes.  I would say my little batch yielded at the most 4 servings, so I doubt the full recipe would serve 18 – more like 12.  This was very, very good.  The crumb topping gets nice and crunchy.  Would be wonderful served with a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.  I wouldn’t hesitate to make this again, but with my modifications.

I'm giving 4 stars when I want to give 3. BUT since I made this recipe using ALL strawberries, I want to be fair. It had a pretty good flavor but the consistancy was unappealing. Almost like paste. Too thick for our liking. I will try this recipe again using strawberries and rhubarb next time.

For me it needed more fruit and less sugar.  Next time I think I will do as someone else suggested and cut sugar to 3/4 cup. Also was not much fruit for all that crust.  I am going to try an extra cup of each next time.  The crust is VERY tasty though and fruit consistency was good as well. Could be eaten warm and not run all over the plate :)

First, I admit, I cannot take the credit for baking this one, but I found the recipe for my hubby's niece, Tammy while we were on vacation in Wisconsin. She baked it exactly as written and it came out wonderfully.  She needed a little bit longer bake time, but that could have been her oven.  I'll be making this the next time I can find some rhubarb in Florida.

I use my food processor for the butter and flour and then add the br. sugar and oats to that and stir by hand.  Makes for a nice consistency on top.  This is one of our favorite summer treats.

My mom said this was the best crisp she's ever had.  I did double the "crisp" part and put half on the bottom and sprinkle the other half on top.  It was absolutely delicious!

As suggested by others, I halved the topping and baked it in a 9x9, and used only 1/2 cup sugar. I also added baking time because it looked so liquidy, but I'm not sure I needed to - it seemed to dry up (in a good way) as it cooled.

I used 4 cups rhubarb and 4 cups strawberries, left other ingredients the same and it turned out perfect. No need for any spices it is perfect the way it is. Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful! I've made a number of different rhubarb crumbles/crunch and this is by far the best. The topping is superb and stays crunchy even after being refrigerated.

This was wonderful.  I made it in a 9x9 pan instead of 9x13 so it was a little thicker.  Delicious.  I just had to look the other way as I added all that butter!

This recipe is great. I made it as written, except I added more fruit. It does make a lot of crunch topping as another reviewer said but I like it that way. I did not feel it needed anything else. It turned out perfect as written. It is also very sweet but again, I prefer it that way. Very easy. I will definitely make this again.

I made this as a way to use up home grown rhubarb.  It was wonderful -- just needed to be spiced up a bit so I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping.  Would have contributed pecans as well but didn't have any on hand.  I cut the sugar by a third and it was plenty sweet.  A pleasing dish!

Wow...I've had & made lots of different versions of rhubarb crisp over the years, but this one is by far the best. Love the addition of strawberries.  Made it exactly as the recipe call for.  My husband loved it.  Makes a large pan, so makes for great leftovers.  Thanks Michelle for the terrific recipe!

This was my first time cooking with (and eating) rhubarb. I liked how the rhubarb chunks maintained their consistency, so it wasn't a runny mess. I followed the reviewers' suggestions and cut back on the sugar, and was very pleased with the result. A great first dish for someone who's been afraid to try rhubarb.

I made this with quick oats instead of rolled oats and the "crunch" part turned out more like cake than anything else. The crunch part was a little bland. Use rolled oats and I'm sure it will turn out better.

Very yummy.  I can't wait to make again with sweet local strawberries.  My only change was the topping, I used 1 cup each of butter, flour, brown sugar and rolled oats (my mom's recipe).  I use a pastry blender to mix it together.  Wonderful flavor!

This was soooo yummy!  I took what others said and filled a big casserole with strawberries and rhubarb (probably double the recipe called for) and mixed it with one cup of splenda and just a little more flour for thickener. I also halved the topping to cut the fat content and cooked it the same 45 mins.  It was so good my family devoured the huge casserole in one day!

I can not believe what a simple and DELICIOUS crunch this is. I've been making it for over a year now, and everyone that has tasted it absolutely LOVES it!!! I've even used frozen rhubarb and strawberries and it still is great! Excellent crunch!! What a great way to use the fresh rhubarb & strawberries in combination! Topped with whipped cream or ice cream makes it doubly good!

I love this recipe!  I have been making this dish for a number of years after Safeway put it in their ad one summer.  I use half (or even less sometimes) the amount of white sugar and have even used SPLENDA before.  I also only use 3/4 C of butter and just eye ball the rest of the crumble top to cut out a little of the fat and it still turns out great.  Of course this is yummy to serve warm with vanilla ice cream!

Wonderful recipe. Used 2 tbsp honey instead of white sugar, to cut down on sugar. Tasted great.

I just found this recipe and have already made it 2x in 1 week!  It is great!  I used 3c. of rhubarb and 3 1/2 c. of strawberries.  I also doubled the crisp toppings as stated in other reviews.  I got so many requests for the recipe everyone thought it was great!

This recipe is good as written, but not great. I advise doing as some other members mention and add a little cinnamon and possibly some nutmeg, it needs a little something for flavor. I found that it was not too sweet for me and liked the amount of topping in the recipe itself. So the only addition I would make would be the spices.

I was a bit disappointed by this recipe because the reviews were so positive. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and that was fine, added cinnamon and nutmeg to the fruit as well. The topping came out bland even though I added walnuts and more cinnamon. It definitely needs salt if you are using un-salted butter. I used all of the topping but I think it was too much because the finished dessert was mostly crumb topping and very little fruit! I could hardly taste the fruit at all which was a let-down because usually rhubarb and strawberries have such a bright juicy flavor. If I were to make this recipe again I would increase the amount of strawberries, add some lemon juice and lots of cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling mixture. I would also add salt to the topping and reduce the amount of topping overall. I'm probably better off just finding a new recipe instead of making all those changes! This one just didn't do it for me.

I added an extra cup of each strawberries and rhubarb, as well as a bit of cinammon and freshly ground nutmeg and an extra tablespoon of flour. Still needed more fruit or a smaller pan, would be nice with a little less sugar.

Excellent flavor for both, filling and crunch. I made half the topping. Substituted a mixture of whole grains / flours for all purpose flour.

This is a great recipe -- one of my kids' favorite summer treats. It' great for people with allergies, too -- easy to substitute the butter for milk-free butter and flour for an appropriate flour.

I love this recipe!  It is a perfect blend of rhubarb and berries.  I followed the recipe to a T and thought everything was perfect.  It's a little on the sour side, but that's how I like it.  Makes it more compatible with a scoop of ice cream!  There is also room to change up the berries that are used for different varitions.   Use up what you have on hand! This one is a winner!!

Delicious!  Occasionally I've used more strawbs than rhubarb too - and it was just fine.  Serve it slightly warm with vanilla ice cream on top.  Fabulous!

This is wonderful.  We liked it even better the second day, warmed just slightly in the microwave.  The flavors had mellowed a bit.  We also tried this with blueberries one time.  Another time we used raspberries and added chopped walnuts to the topping.  Good with a little ice cream or whipped cream.  This is a favorite!

Amazing ~ I'll definitely make this again... could not get enough of the topping.  I've already borrowed the recipe for the topping and added it to my favorite rhubarb crisp (without strawberries!!!).  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was AMAZING.  I followed some of the tips that others had.  I put in 4 heaping cups of the rhubarb and strawberries, reduced the sugar just a little, and only used 3/4 C. of butter in the crust.  HUGE hit with everyone!! Would definetly make again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe is delicious. I was looking for a rhubarb crisp and came upon this. I didn't have any strawberries so I used 6 cups of rhubarb instead. It is a bit tart and I should of added a bit more sugar but I'm sure if I had used strawberries it would of been sweeter. The topping is delicious and cooks up crispy and yummy. I wouldn't make less!! It's like a crispy oatmeal cookie on top. We love it.

Nothing but rave reviews for this one.  I cut back on the topping by using only 1 stick butter, 1 cup oats, 1/2 cup bro sugar and 1/2 cup flour.  That was plenty.  Wife can't get enough of it.

THE "CRUMBLE" WAS MORE LIKE COOKIE DOUGH. AND NO MATTER WHAT I DID IT NEVER CHANGED. IT ENDED UP ION THE TRASH. I THINK IT STARTS WITH TO MUCH BUTTER, UPON INVESTIGATION OF OTHER LIKE RECIPES I FOUND THEY USE MUCH LESS.

I used the first of my rhubarb in this dish and it turned out nicely. I added cinnamon to the topping and used about 1/4 c less sugar in the fruit layer and it still came out sweet enough. I'll probably make it again.

The recipe is the best Michelle! I used four cups of strawberries, a bit more oats and also added some cinnamon to the topping. Strawberry flavored whipped topping added just the right touch. Thanks so much for a dessert that my whole family raved over!!

Very tasty recipe! was very easy and simple. Next time will add cinnamon to topping for a little more flavor!  There  was plenty of topping, usually when you make cobblers there is never enough topping! I really enjoyed this recipe, will be a favorite of mine!!!!

What an great recipe!! My Mom loves strawberry rhubarb pie, so for her anniversary this year, I gave her the choice of the pie, or this crunch. She chose the crunch, & it was wonderful!! The only complaint I have is that the prep time was a lot longer than 15 mins!!! I used fresh rhubarb, & stawberries, & it took me about 30 mins! Even with the extra time, it was worth it, I got more than one excellent rating from my family! We'll be making this again & again!!! Thanks

This is a very yummy way to use up the extra rhubarb that is so plentiful this time of year. I did find that there was too much of the topping even with the addition of some extra berries - 3/4 cup of oats, 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup marg. worked perfect for me.
I will enjoy this recipe for years to come!

This is a great recipe.  I used 8 cups of rhubarb and 6 cups of strawberries.  I love the topping so I don't cut that part of the recipe in half.  I don't think it makes too much at all.

I made a few changes, 4 cups each of strawberry & rhubarb and cut the topping in half and added 1/2 cup of pecans. Used a slightly bigger baking dish. Made for Father's Day, served it with French Vanilla Ice Cream and everyone enjoyed it!

YUMMMMMMMMMY!!!!  I made this at work and it came out great.  I have a classroom of disabled adults and everyone did a great job helping me make this.  I took another reviewers advice and added cinnamon, nutmeg, cut back the sugar, increased the fruit and halved the amout of topping.  We served it at a Memorial Day luncheon we had with our friends.  Thank you for a keeper.

This was a very tasty dessert.  The only thing is that next time when I make this, I will 1/2 the topping.  I found it to be too thick.  Overall a plesant taste.

Good Heavens!!!! This was so good, and I am not that fond of rhubarb!!!  I had a hard time finding fresh rhubarb, so I used the pre-cut frozen type.  But I did use fresh strawberries. Just the right amount of tartness.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Tasty and so easy and quick to make.  I halved the recipe, increasing the rhubarb and strawberries to 2 cups each, and then baked in a 7" x 11" pan, sprayed with a quick shot of oil.  Made a nice sized dessert for my family of 4.

WOW! I was looking for a quick and easy dessert to make for a family gathering. When I found this recipe I was curious, and my husband is always harping at me because everything I cook is too complicated. I tried this and thought it was great! I doubled the recipe and the crumble - there was a lot of it and I ended up throwing some of it away. When it was baking the house smelled absolutely wonderful, and despite myself I had to try some. And I don't even like rhubarb! What a delicious treat and thank you for posting this great recipe! Corrie in Washington State

I used frozen rhubard from the grocery store and frozen strawberries from last years garden and boy did it come out tasting great. Very easy to make. I warmed up the leftovers in the microwave(high for 1 min) and it tastes like it just came from the oven.

I used 4 cups rhubarb to 2 cups strawberries as I always have more rhubarb than I can use.  This is the tastiest combination of rhubarb/strawberry and ingredients that I have ever made or eaten.  It turns out this way time after time and everyone who eats it loves it.

This was DELICIOUS!! This was my first time cooking with rhubarb! I added the full cup of sugar but it was still a little too tart for my taste. But I'm sure if I had vanilla ice cream that would have helped with that. I didn't think it was too much topping like some others have posted. But I like lots of crunch topping so me and my family were very happy with that. Overall this is a great recipe!! Will continue to use this! Also I added cinnamon to taste to the oat topping!

I've tried this recipe several times now and it was always a hit. Tried other fruits too with the rhubarb (apples, peaches), all great! The last one I made was really delicious based on the reactions of the family members. Made some tweaks in the last batch: added nutmeg and grated orange rind to the fruit mix. For the topping, added cinnamon. Another change I did, I added shredded coconut to the topping. Yum!

Very sweet! I made it according to the instructions and ate it with ice cream. I did divide the mix between two smaller square pans, and I would definitely spread it thin next time. If the crumble mixture isn't thin enough, it gets mushy instead of crunchy, and since there is no leavening in it, it doesn't spread or rise to fill the pan.

This was a great recipe. I did use just a half cup of sugar and it was perfect...enough sweetness to enjoy some of the rhubarb's tartness, if that makes sense. It did put 1/2tsp of cinnamon and 1/4tsp of nutmeg in both the topping and the rhubarb. I found that the amount of topping was ideal if half of it is used like a thin crust under the rhubarb and the other half is scattered over the top. Yum!

Super easy & super yummy. I followed the advice of some of the other reviews; I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and doubled the fruit (rather than reduce the crumble)

This is a great recipe.  Simple, straight-forward and comes out awesome every single time.  It's no fail!  Feel free to experiment with different summer fruits...rhubarb, strawberry of course...but blackberries, blueberries, raspberries can also be added along with, to make up the 6+ cups of fruit. I didn't have quite enough rhubarb in my garden to make up 3 cups, so I improvised with other berries and the results were fantastic. Simply the best!

Awesome recipe! I added raspberries too, which only added to the deliciousness.  Halving the crumble topping is a good idea; will do that next time.

If using frozen rhubarb put 1/4 cup of flour. This was excellent and the ladies at the retreat loved it!  I also added sliced almonds to the crumble on top. Perfect just the way it is, no need to alter measurements. :)

I'm giving this recipe itself 4 stars (I'd probably do 3.5 if I could) as it helped me be able to have a base to make some adjustments from.  Like some other reviewers have said, the proportions are a bit off for my liking.  I used 2.5 c strawberries, 2 c rhubarb (that was all I had), and about 1/3 c sugar plus 3Tbs flour mixed together with the fruit.  Fresh strawberries are very sweet, and 1 cup of sugar was just way too much. For the topping, I did 2/3c each of dark brown sugar, flour, and old fashioned oats with a 1/2 c of butter.  I also added a 1/2tsp of orange extract, and think I'll do 1 tsp next time.  I have also added almond extract to the topping.  This seems to be the best combination and amounts of ingredients for my fiance and me, it's sweet but not overpowering, and just the right amount of crumble on top!

I made this tonight.  This was very, very good.  I did not have enough strawberries on hand - but I did have some blueberries - The rhubarb I picked fresh, used 2 cups of strawberries and added 1 cup of blueberries - I also used Splenda as we have some in the family that can't have much sugar - the rest of the recipe was followed exactly as written,  This had a wonderful flavor - not too sweet.  I did think, while making the crumble that it looked like a lot - however I used it all - as was written.  I am glad I did - after baking, the topping was just right.  All in all the recipe is just fine in my book - I will be making this quite a bit this summer.  Thank you Michelle!

Outstanding recipe! It really enhances the flavor of the strawberries and rhubarb without overwhelming them. I also increased the strawberries and rhubarb to 4 cups each but kept everything else the same. Family and friends rave every time I make it!

Would love it as is, but also to play with. Added blueberries, canned  rasberries canned blackberries - as long as total is 8 cups.
Fantastic!! Also used tapicoca flour for crust, corn starch in mix to make it gluten free.

I made it vegan by using coconut oil, gluten free by using GF flour, and decreased the sugar and substituted some raw honey. I put slivered almonds on the top of the crumble. It is really good!

Very good. Used some frozen fruit we put away from the summer months. Kids loved it. A bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla or nuts might make a nice addition.

Added a bit more of the crunch ingredients,  and did mixed berries instead of strawberries.   Superb either way!

I have made this twice and am obsessed with this recipe! The first time I made it, I followed to the T. I made the topping by mixing everything with my fingers and it came out almost dumpling like but was very tasty. The second time, I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and pulsed the whole thing in my food processor. I also used about 2 TBL less of butter and added 1/2 cup blueberries. When pulsed in the food processor, the topping is more crumbly but I felt like it was too much and would make only half. I also added the zest of one whole lemon - made it sweet and tangy at the same time. This recipe is a must make in the spring if you like rhubarb as much as I do!

I made this today and overall it is a great recipe though I altered a few things based on other reviews:
I halved the crunchy topping and it is definitely more than enough after doing so, though next time I would reduce the butter at least by half. I also reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 of a cup and this was still TOO sweet, next time I will reduce the sugar by half or even more, maybe 1/3 cup even. Lastly, I upped the flour to 5 tbsp as I like a thicker filling. 
A great base recipe that can easily be altered based on your own likes/dislikes.

This smells and tastes amazing! Like some other reviewers, I increased the amount of both the strawberries and rhubarb to 4 cups each and decreased the white sugar to 3/4 cup. Also, it's not necessary to try and cut the cold butter into the dry ingredients. You will get the same result if you mix the dry ingredients, pour it over the fruit, and cut the butter into pats and lay them evenly on top of the crumble mixture. It's a lot easier. This recipe is a keeper!

Loved it. I used 4 cups each of the fruit, decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and the flour to 5 tablespoons. I left topping as is and added a dash of cloves, nutmeg, 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and a handful of chopped almonds. This is an amazing recipe.

Awesome, but i put it into a pre-cut pie crust. My wife and I loved it, and it was so simple (for some reason I have never looked up strawberry rhubarb before even though I love it.

I real unique desert I have never tried before! I increased the fruit and dropped some of the sugar and it came out fine. Only thing was the size of the pan. I should've used a flatter one. Besides that, it's a delicious dish.

Delicious!!!!! My husband'd never had rhubarb and I'd only had it in pie, we couldn't get enough- loved it!!! I cut the amount of butter in half- just thought 1 cup looked like too much. I will definitely make this again! Yumm!!

This is one of the best recipes for rhubarb.I made this for so many parties and gatherings with lots of compliments and request for more. To the crunch, I add a cup of chopped walnuts, 1/2 marg/1/2 butter softened (instead of all butter). I use this same recipe for blueberries and other fruits. It's a winner with my family and friends.

Unlike many others, I use ALL the topping (well almost all, it's so darn good I usually snack a bit on it before putting it on the fruit...).  I used a canned rhubarb, strawberry mixture the first time as it was too early for fresh rhubarb and it was pretty good, though have made it since with fresh and no surprise it is much better.  I could eat this every day. Seriously.

Awesome recipe!  I have my own topping recipe (very similar to this one) that I use, so I mainly tried this recipe for the filling... LOVED IT!  I used the 1 cup of sugar and it left the filling with a perfectly balanced sweet & tart taste.  The only thing I might do differently next time is add a touch more flour because it seemed a little runny, but that certainly didn't affect the taste!  It could be because I used frozen rhubarb instead of fresh... either way, this recipe is a keeper, thanks!!

VERY good. I brought this to a cookout and it got devoured! I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was great, but I agree with the other reviewers that it would be better with 4 or 5 cups of strawberry and rhubarb. Also will use just 3/4 cup of sugar, it was a bit too sweet. I will add a bit of cinnamon and vanilla to the fruit mixture as other reviewers did. Could also easily cut back on the flour and the butter. 
Took FOREVER to cut all the rhubarb and strawberries, but it was totally worth it! This is good served cold, but much better warm with a little ice cream :)

Out of this world perfect!  Proportions were just right with a nice balance of sour to sweet!  On the tart side with a hint of sweet.

I added 3/4t. cinnamon and nutmeg...perfect!

Absolutely perfect! I sliced my strawberries and combined them w frozen rhubarb the night before. I think sitting overnight made more of the juices come out of the fruit. Because of this,  I added 2 more table spoons of flour. I divided the mixture between 8 ramekins and topped it w the crunch mixture. (I did have some extra) Served w vanilla ice cream.  I wish I was tech savvy, I would have taken a pic- they were soooo CUTE!

I used half the butter and half the white sugar this recipe calls for and tasted perfect to me. As with any recipe adjust to your own taste. I prefer a bit of tartness of the rhubarb so I used less sugar.  I used a half a cup of butter in the crumble but mixed it very well with a pastry cutter. I thought it was perfect.

Great recipe! Very easy, tasty. I will double the topping next time, as the amount I did make only made a thin covering over the fruit.  I did add cinnamon to the topping, but that was the only change I made. This is wonderful served warm with vanilla ice cream. Extra batch was a great hit at work. :)

Loved it! Used 4 cups each rhubarb & straawberries, everything else as written. We found it to be a good balance of tart-sweet & the amount of crumble. We LOVE rhubarb so next time I'll use 5 cups rhubarb & 3 cups strawberries, & perhaps 3/4 crumble to suit our tastes, but it is great as is & definitely worth trying.

This was WAY too sweet and VERY runny. I like sweet stuff, but this was so sweet I could hardly taste the strawberries and the rhubarb flavor nearly was non-existant. I used 2 1/2 cups each strawberries and rhubarb as that's what I had. Because I had a total of 5 instead of 6 cups, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and kept the flour to 3 tablespoons.  Luckily I put the pan onto  large cookie sheet, as it bubbled over.  As I took it out of the oven, I tilted the pan so more of the juice could run off onto the cookie sheet, and about 1/2-3/4 cup worth did.  I let it stand for an hour before scooping some out to serve, still very runny!  If I were to make this again, I would use 3 cups each as the recipe states and cut the sugar in half to 1/2 cup and increase the flour to probably double.  Overall, not too happy with the outcome.

Super yummy! Next time I think I will had less sugar, with the natural sweetness of the fruit it's a little to much.  Also, more oats, maybe 1/4c more.

Used this recipe as is, and it was great. Personal preference, I think it was a little sweeter than I'd like. With several diabetic children, I could stand to use less sugar, split it with an alternative (Truvia, Splenda, or similar- for those wondering about baking with these, they work great, and you don't really notice a huge aftertaste too much, but I'm likely used to that flavor than the average person), or use all alternative sweetener. I also like about twice as much crisp topping. I noted the reviews of others saying that it was more than enough, so I followed as is, but it's probably my favorite part, so I would probably just double it. Again, personal preference. I didn't have any good way to combine the butter and dry ingredients, so I just did as my mom always does, cut into thin pats, mix some in with dry ingredients that sort of fall down into the mix, and set some on the top to melt down in as it bakes. Easy enough, and the ones on top melt in and caramelize, making it a little extra crunchy in spots and very yummy. 
This recipe is great as it is and easy to adjust to individual tastes. You can also modify with whatever other fruit you would like. I did this another night with some frozen tropical mix fruit (thaw and drain first), and it came out great too. just plan to fill the rest of your pan (9x13 for me) to the almost-top with your fruit and cover with streusel topping. You (almost) can't go wrong. Thanks, Michelle.

I used slightly less sugar as the strawberries were very ripe and sweet.  Delicious

This recipe is a keeper for us! I took it to a BBQ, and I actually halved the recipe because even though there were several people there, not everyone likes rhubarb. I definitely should have DOUBLED the recipe instead of halving it, it was a hit! I followed the recipe exactly for the filling and baking time, but for the crisp, I used the ingredients from Triple Berry Crisp on this site (I made both recipes for the party). I added a bit of cinnamon and ground nutmeg to the crisp and even drizzled a bit of honey over it. Next time I make this recipe, I'll double the amount of strawberry and rhubarb, but I will NOT increase the amount of flour. I think it's a necessary addition, but the proportion was a bit high.

I had strawberry rhubarb, so I used cranberries instead of strawberries. I also used a pack of maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal for the topping. The results were delicious .

I thought this recipe was absolutely phenomenal.  I used about 3/4 cup of white sugar because I didn't feel it needed a whole cup.  The amount of topping was PERFECT!  I will definitely be making this again.

Wonderfully delicious!! I changed it just a bit to mimic a pie from my childhood, Strawberry Ruhbarb Crumb Pie. I used 10oz. each of strawberry and ruhbarb, added a bottom pie crust and made it into 6 small tarts. I can't wait to make this again, exactly the pie I remember and it looked beautiful!

Very, very good- and I didn't tweak it much at all. Had more strawberries to use up, so I probably had about 4.5 cups of strawberries, and I used a little less butter in the topping, but I thought the amount was just fine- you need to have a decent amount of crunch topping! As for other's complaints about sweetness, I have a husband who never had rhubarb before he met me, so it has to be sweet or the rhubarb's tartness scares him off.  This was sweet enough for him, and I still felt that there was enough tang of the rhubarb for my tastes too- I wouldn't alter the sugar amount unless you REALLY want a lot of tartness to come through.  I made this when my in-laws visited (who aren't big on rhubarb), and it lasted less than 24 hours (4 adults and 2 young kids).  Very good!

Agreed that the recipe without change deserves 4 stars, but with a few tweaks it is at least a 5 star recipe. These are the changes I made (mind you that I made it for a crowd and this can be easily cut in half) I used 16 cups of fruit total (I like more strawberries and less rhubarb but any amount equaling 16 cups works) I used 5 cups of sugar (you can lessen this if you like a less sweet dessert or if you have extra sweet strawberries) I used 1 cup of minute tapioca (instead of the flour- this makes for a better texture in my opinion and no chance you get a flour taste in your product but make sure you buy the minute tapioca) mix the sugar, fruit and the tapioca and let sit for 15 minutes. I doubled the topping for this amount of product but if I were to make it half I would make it just as the recipe calls.. Baking instructions are perfect just be sure and check it after 1/2 hour to make sure your fruit does not overcook. This is great recipe with a few changes! Enjoy!!

I thought this was good basic recipe and can be made as is.  I did make it, except for the white sugar measurement, as described, but I need to reduce the butter and sugar for health reasons.  Next time I will make the following changes: 1) Reduce the amount of white sugar to 2 tablespoons of Turbinado sugar. 2) substitue whole wheat pastry flour 3) Reduce butter to 1/2 cup.  When assembeling, I'm going to use a 9 inch pie pan, use half of the topping and press it in the bottom for a crust.  Bake for 10 minutes, remove and spread the fruit, and sprinkle the rest of the topping over it.  Return to oven and bake for the remainder of the time.  It was great with the vanilla ice cream, but I may use melted white chocolate or Royal icing and drizzle it on prior to serving.  Still, this is good recipe.

My fiance is British. He was hungry for "Rhubarb Crumble". I figured this is what he wanted and I was right. Top it off while still slightly warm with some vanilla ice cream, and you'll think you're in heaven! LOVE IT!!!

This dessert is easy and delicious!  I made no changes at all, except that I halved the ingredients because I didn't have enough rhubarb and strawberries for the whole recipe.  Everyone loved this dessert.  I don't think I will make strawberry-rhubarb pie ever again because this was so much more tasty and easy to make than pie.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

Amazing! I was intimidated at first because I've never used rhubarb in anything before. I doubled the recipe for a 9x11 pan, and the proportion was perfect. Made it for grandmas 75 bday and the whole family was very impressed and loved it.

Excellent and Easy! Two words every working woman loves to hear!  I took others advice and added extra strawberries.  I could not bring myself to put in a WHOLE cup of butter!  I only cut 3/4 cup of butter into the crumb topping and it was fine.  I sprinkled a heaping 1/2 cu. of chopped up pecans as a last layer on the topping.   It was O-SO-GOOD!

Great recipe! I only had strawberries in a frozen blend of mango, strawberry, and papaya and used the whole bag still frozen. I topped it with some Dream Whip and it was fabulous. This was very rich. What a versatile recipe. Thanks!

This recipe is one of the best on this site! I agree with the folks adding more fruit...and more crunchy topping. The proportions of flour in the fruit and topping worked well for me although I reduced the butter in the topping. I also added about 1 cup of chopped pecans to the topping.

Pick the finest vanilla ice cream for this dessert - and your guests won't stop complimenting your baking skills!! Super easy to make as well.

Thanks for this one!!

This was absolutely delicious! We only used about 3/4 cup brown sugar to lower the sugar level but everything else we did exactly and it was fantastic! We had it with some french vanilla ice cream and that is definitely a good companion to this dish. This dish is tasty and easy to make and I will definitely be making it again soon!

Very Yummy! It does make an aweful lot of crumble though, so using a deep pie dish, I used some of the 'crumble' for a bottom pie crust which i baked before filling. I also used 4 cups rhubard & strawberry instead of 3. Served warm its delicious.

Super yummy. My 10 year old daughter made this tonight, and it turned out great! It was her first taste of rhubarb, and she licked her bowl. Dad loved it too. This would be great with other fruits too. Nice basic crunch recipe. Easy enough for a 10 year old!

I made this for the first time a couple days ago, it. is. FANTASTIC! My husband and I love it, and I brought some to work, it's an enormous hit.  It's just the right amount of tart and sweet, and the crust cooked is the perfect consistency; not too bready, not too crunchy.  Great texture and taste.

This dish is DELICIOUS! I made a few changes to make it a little more healthy. For the filling: I only used 3/4 cup sugar rather than then whole 1 cup  and instead of all white sugar, I used half Splenda/half sugar blend. I also substituted 2 Tbs of the white flour with whole wheat flour. For the topping: Substituted 1/2 cup of white flour for wheat flour again. These changes made the dish a little more healthy and no less tasty! I couldn't stop eating it!

very good.  i've never cooked with rhubarb before (in fact, i think this is only the second time i've even eaten it) and i followed the recipe exactly.  next time i will add more fruit as i thought the crust was just a little too thick to the fruit ratio.

This is a hit wherever it goes.  I'd like to add that you can halve the white sugar and decrease the brown sugar by 1/4 cup and still have a perfect and popular dessert, minus some of the sugar.

Very good.  I doubled the fruit and flour, kept the sugar the same since I don't like my desserts overly sweet.  Crumb topping was great.

Yummy! Made this twice this month already. I doubled the topping because I love the crumble part of these types of desserts. It's very tart, but if you like that sort of thing you'll be in heaven. A beautiful combination. Do make sure you use cold butter and cut it into the crumble with knives....my hubby thought he would cheat and use his hands to incorporate the butter on the second batch we made. The butter melted and the crunch ended up being more of a dough. Still delish though!

I would have liked a bit more topping on this personally. I cut the sugar in half - I was using sweet fresh picked strawberries. Overall, this recipe was very good. Simple too.

We couldn't stop eating it! Hand chopping took too long, so next time we'll have to try a cuisinart for the rhubarb, then the strawberries. Not sure if there's an easier way to mix the topping.   I'm glad we didn't try any extra spices or changes to the recipe, it seems perfect.

This was fabulous!!  And though I did change some things based on reviews, I still think it would have been a 5-star regardless...just not as "hearty" without the changes due to the odd fruit/topping ratio.  So, I increased the fruit to 5c. strawberries (~2lbs) and 4c. rhubarb (~7 stalks) and therefore increased the flour to 4T.  I also decreased the sugar a tad to 3/4c. because I thought the strawberries were plenty sweet.  Next time I do think I will also decrease the flour for the topping to 1c. and add some cinnamon and nutmeg to it, but that is all personal preference.  It was a tad runny in the end, but I think that was because we didn't let it sit at all and served it immediately.  I also wish I would have cooked it a tad longer than the 45 minutes, as the top could have "crisped" up a tad more and the rhubarb could have been a bit softer.  SO YUM!!!!!

Very delicious and easy too.  I followed the recipe, other than increasing the fruit by close to an extra 1 cup of each.  Love the crunchy topping.  I used old fashioned oats.

The only change I made is I use about half a cup of flour in the crust/topping and it makes the crust/topping a lot crispier.  Made this a couple of times and planted rhubarb in the back yard I enjoy it so much!

Pretty darn good. A bit too runny for me; I am considering adding some tapioca next time. Made with more fruit and half the topping. I barely had time to take a photo before my 6 year old ate the portion seen on the plate.

Wonderful crunch and super easy to whip up. My husband loved the thick top but i would have preferred a little more rhubarb/strawberry filling. I may make some alterations next time.

This is a 10 star recipe!  My favorite pie is Strawberry Rhubarb - but this is soooo easy and my family - all the way down the picky baby who won't try anything - LOVED it!  Making it tonight for friends!  Thanks!

I increased the amount of fruit by 1 c. each, but I would keep the flour to 3 or 4 Tbsp. I did 5 Tbsp, too much flour (not that anyone else noticed but me).  Everyone loved it and went back for seconds :)

A very good recipe but I cut it in half to make a 9x9 pan, used 2 cups of strawberries and 1 cup of rhubarb. I kept the cook time at 45 minutes. It was delicious. I also think that it was a tad sweet and the sugar could be reduced by about a third.

I really like this recipe! I made it exactly as written, except I only used 1 tablespoon of flour in the filling since I like it to be juicier. I will certainly make it again.

This was wonderful, per other reviews I cut down on the sugar to about 3/4 c of each, could have even used less.  I also took other's advice and increased the fruit, I used 6 cups of each in a 9 x 13 pan and it was perfect.

Have gotten this recipe a number years ago, have used all the time, yes it does bubble up on the sides, also have put in frozen cranberries, with the raspberries and rhubarb kept the same amounts of the topping, also have used blueberries with the raspberries and rhubarb, it is an  excellent dessert, have also put in the topping a bag of one of the instant oatmeal cereals, just the right amount cinnamon and other spices

This was delicious!  I'm always skeptical of rhubarb crisp - I've had quite a few not-so-great encounters with it at my grandma's house.  But this exceeded my expectations ten-fold.  It was a hit for the entire house!

Made this a couple of weekends ago and it was very good, used more fruit then it called for as it was what I had to use.  My brother in law inhaled this dessert which was surprising cause after I made it I found out he didn't like rhubarb.  He even asked for seconds!!!

I cut the sugar by about 1/3 and it was still super tasty.  I will try to cut even more next time as it was still a bit on the sweet side for us.

This is one of the best tasting crisps I have tried.  I did use more fruit, 4 cups each of Rhubarb and Strawberries.  I also used 2 Tbsp. cornstarch in the fruit mix to thicken it so that it would not be runny.  It turned out perfect.  Excellent with some ice cream!

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!  I followed the recipe pretty closely (I may not have 'measured' all ingredients accurately), and WOW!  I ate too much of it.  I took part to work and everyone loved it.  I shared it with my roommate, and she loved it.  I shared the recipe with my parents.  They made it and loved it.  Relatively quick, easy, yummy.  This is definitely a keeper!

I did change this recipe, but it was delicious. I halved it all, but then used 2 cu each of the rhubarb and strawberries and because our berries were fresh picked and very sweet, only used 3T of sugar for the filling and no flour. I also added a small amount of cornstarch dissolved in water to the filling to help keep it all together.  The topping was perfect as is halved. I cooked it in a deep 7x7 dish for 22 mins.   Delicious crisp!

A family favourite.  My only change was reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup and adding 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the crumble. I've also made this with apples, instead of rhubarb. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great recipe! I frequently make "new" recipes for our family, and this is a keeper. I was worried the kids might not like the rhubarb taste, but I was fighting them off as they wanted to finish the pan! Thanks!

This is a great and easy recipe! I added one addition tablespoon of flour to make it a little thicker. Also to the topping I added 1-2 teaspoons of nutmeg and 1/4 cup slivered almonds. Yum!

This recipe is delicious.  My family (including my mother in law) raved over it.  My father in law is diabetic so I tried this recipe using splenda and it came out delicious also (a little less sweet than the original but still delicious).  This is a keeper.

I halved this recipe for my small family, but discovered that 3 small stalks only makes one cup of sliced rhubarb. So, I used 2 cups of strawberries and 1 cup rhubarb, then followed the recipe reducing each ingredient by half. In the topping, I added a dash or two of cinnamon. This recipe was fabulous, the fruit was juicy, tart and sweet. The topping stayed crunchy even through the next day. It's a recipe that would tempt you for a second helping and give you urges to make a run for Haagen Daz vanilla.

It was good after a few mods.  I made the filling as instructed except I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white.  I also added a 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  I only used ahlf the amount of topping though.  Quite good.

This was really yummy! I used a little more fruit, & sprinkled a little cinnamon & nutmeg in with the topping, but kept everything else the same. I actually halved the recipe (& used 4 c. fruit) & baked in 7X11 pan. Never cooked rhubarb before, so wasn't sure how big the pieces should be. Turned out great though. Even 11 yr old liked it. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

YUUUUM!  I put a little extra fruit...maybe 1/2 cup more rhubarb & 1 cup strawberries (just because I had them and didn't want to waste them.) and it was excellent.  I also threw in a dash or two of cinim. & nutmeg to the topping for the fun of it, and it was yumicious also!

I bought one pound of Rhubarb. Cut to 1/2 inch dice, it made 4 cups. I also used 4 cups of sliced strawberries. Definitely could have used more. Too much topping. A little too sweet for us. We like our rhubarb tart!

My favorite part of this recipe is the "crunch"...the topping of these bars.  I used ripe strawberries that were very sweet, so I reduced the sugar.  I used frozen rhubarb, which is hard to cut up if you let it get to soft (if you haven't cut it up before freezing it).  My family enjoyed this recipe.

...this recipe didn't really say to melt the butter (topping) but I think it would change the texture and maybe give it more crunch factor??? that's always good...but the rhubarb-to-strawberry ratio seems good here--I always like to chuck some salt in there and kinda set off the sweet just a little--maybe that's just the sailor in me- but good basic all over recipe! p.s. have some emergency vanilla ice cream personel standing by! Needs it for sure!

I have prepared this recipe twice; the first time as a pie. It was a bust with too much floury taste and far too runny and the crust was mushy.  This last time I decided to do it as a crunch. I looked at the amount and no way was it going to serve 18 as it states and if it was put into a 9x13 casserole the stretched out amount would be so thin it would be a disaster.  I used 4 cups each of fruit, increased white sugar to 1 1/2 cups, reduced flour to 1/2 cup, added a pinch of salt. For the topping I replaced butter with salt free marg and added a hint of cinnamon to the crust.  Put it in a 375 oven for 35 mins. A success.

There is WAY too much topping for this recipe and not enough fruit.  I increased the filling to 4 cups of strawberries and 4 cups of rhubarb and the filling was almost perfect.  A little on the tart side but I used frozen strawberries because I had them on hand.  I would probably reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup if I had used fresh strawberries.  I would also reduce the topping to HALF what the recipe calls for.  I didn't use all of it because I didn't have room in my baking dish (and I did use a 9x13) and it was still way too much.  If I hadn't increased the fruit there would be more topping than filling.  As made it was about half and half.

I would make this recipe again but with half the filling and more fruit and I would also add some cinnamon to the topping, it needed a bit of spice.  Mine also had a bit of an odd taste but I think that's because I used margarine (again just because I had it on hand) so I won't blame that on the recipe, I'll just note it's best to use real butter.

I had never tried anything rubarb until this, and I really enjoyed it! 

I made this for my dad's birthday because he is such a huge rubarb fan and never gets to eat it. He claimed it was just as good as what his mom used to make, that the rubarb stands on its own but is just sweet enough blended with the strawberry & sugar to please anybody. 

The recipe was a piece of cake, no baking could be easier. Didn't change a thing!

Wow!  This was amazing!  I followed previous reviewers and added a little less sugar and 1TBS of Cornstarch to thicken it up a little more.  I will definately be adding this to my permanent recipe box.  Thanks for sharing!

I make the same recipe, substituting cherry for the strawberries.  It's the way my grandma and mom have always made it.  Just omit the strawberries and replace with one 21 oz. can of cherry pie filling.  mmmmmmmmmm.

A great summer dessert. The next time I make it, I will increase the rhubarb/strawberry portion and decrease the topping. So good warm with vanilla ice cream!

I made this as requested and he loved it.  I'm not one for rhubarb, but I did taste it and it wasn't too bad even for me(I confess I only had one bite to base this opinion on).  I  put 4 cups of strawberries & rhubarb in it.  Turned out very well.  Thanks.

Really good! My parents are not big into American desserts and really liked this! I had to 2 tablespoons more flour and oats - well actually, used quick cook oatmeal, worked fine!. The increased flour and oats gave it more of a crunch!  Also, I used strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.  A good tang and sweet mix!

This was delicious!! I've made it three times over the past month and it keeps getting better and better...I've switched it up by trying a frozen mixed berry medley in place of the strawberries. Very tasty! Husband is a huge fan and it's so much easier than making a crust!

I had every intention of making a strawberry rhubarb pie today, but the idea of putting together a pie crust was totally unappealing when it came time to put everything together.  Good fortune and good taste smiled down on me; I discovered this lovely crumble!  I followed the recipe except for swapping out an equal amount of cornstarch for the flour to mix with the fruit (cornstarch is a better thickener).  Some may find this too sweet, but in small portions, it's just right, and I bet with ice cream it would just be over the top!  My mouth is smiling!  Thank you, Michelle, for sharing this recipe.

Excellent dessert (or in my case breakfast!) Easy, fast, fresh. I took other reviewers advice and added a small amount of cinnamon and a dash of salt.
After making for 10 years I now cut back on the sugar and use less topping as it is a lot for the amount of fruit. Still incredible!

this crunch is fantastic!  the perfect blend of sweet and tart.  i added 4-5 cups of both strawberries and rhubarb with all the other ingredients as listed, for a fuller pan, and it was perfect.  topped it with vanilla ice cream.  yummmmmm!

I just made this dessert.  It definitely rates five stars.  The only change I made was to decrease the butter to 3/4 cup.  
My husband loved the recipe.

I was looking for a recipe to use up my leftover honey-lime fruit salad and came upon this one...I had pineapple, strawberries, blueberries and mandarin oranges in my fruit salad and I drained of most of the juice.  I only had 3 cups of fruit and so halved the topping and put in an 8 inch round glass baking dish. Baked at 350 until browned on top....This actually turned out really good!  Kids loved it with sweetened whipped cream on top...sooo good!

My co-workers devoured the whole pan in less than 15 minutes!  I think that says it all right there. Glad I made 2 pans so that I can have some more when I get home. Juices were bubbling over before 35 minutes had elapsed so you may want to adjust your cooking time.

This recipe is truly great. Even the rhubarb-haters in my family loved it. I used just 1/2 cup of butter and put a little cinnamon in the topping.

It was pretty good, although I wasn't too big on the topping.  My hubby sure liked it though.

Excellent - definitely a keeper!  The heartiness of the topping is great with the fruit filling.

Incredibly good. I made this today for Father's day, and only brought home a small bowl I had to protect from my 9 year old neice. She ate three helpings, and would have finished off the pan. My dad whose favorite pie is Strawberry/Rubarb loved it.

I first tried this last year when I needed something to take to a picnic birthday party. It went over so well there was very little to take home...saddly. So this year I thought ahead and made 2...one to keep and one to give away. It is really that good.

Mmmmm...ruuuuubarb....

I cut the recipe in half to make a smaller batch, which worked out well. I also cut the topping ingredients further, per other reviews. I really liked the topping, so next time I won't cut back so much (although I'm not sure the entire amount is needed - maybe cutting back by a third or quarter would be better). Also, I only used rubarb, and without the sweetness of strawberries, it came out a bit tart, so next time I will add more sugar. 

This is a keeper. I'm terrible at making pie crust, and this was such an easy alternative - I think putting it together took a whole five minutes! I'm anxious to try making more crunches with other fruits!

I made this for my family and they raved about it.  It was quick and easy as I usually have frozen rhubarb, the only thing I added was a tbsp. of tapioca,just because I like the texture that this gives to fruit deserts.  I will definitely  transfer this recipe to the kitchen recipe box. Thanks Michelle for sharing such a yummy desert.

I have been looking for a Rhubarb/Strawberry dessert to fill the void my husband has
for his great-grandmother's pie,  when she died 20 years ago her recipes died with her
and he complimented that this was super close.  Very delicious and very easy to make
my 8 year old helped and I will definitely be making this again!!!

This was quite good. I doubled the strawberries but left the rhubarb at 3 cups and it turned out fine. I also left the sugar at 1 cup and it was a nice sweet-tart combo. Next time I will add some cinnamon and spices to the crumb topping and cut back on the butter, it was a little bland.

I used raspberries instead of strawberries, doubling the amount of fruit as suggested by others.  It was wonderful!  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping.  Fortunately, because I had frozen rhubarb leftover from last summer, as well as some frozen raspberries, this dessert was very quick and easy to prepare.  It's a keeper.

Great flavor.  I added an additional cup of fruit to the batch, and next time will add even more.  There was a little too much topping for the amount of fruit called for in the recipe.

I added some blueberries and extra strawberries.  I don't measure the fruit  but use whichever casserole dish we have to fit the fruit mixture in. We freeze our rubarb as it is difficult to get in Florida esp. in the winter. AlsoI doubled the topping and added pecans to the  oatmeal with a little extra butter to the topping. Took it to a Christmas party last week and it disappeared!

The only thing I did different was add a tablespoon of cinnamon to the crunch topping.  I will definitely make this again.

I followed others recommendations and added an extra cup of rhubarb and then I baked it for an extra 10 minutes because we LOVE the caramelized edges! OMGosh.... Delicious!!

After reading all the comments, I used 4 cups each of strawberries and rhubarb. Used 5 tbsp. flour and only 1/2 cup of sugar to add to the fruit as my berries were freshly picked and very sweet.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 2/3 cups walnuts to the topping. I only cooked it for 35 minutes. It was delicious!!

Used the recipe as a guide. Was using a smaller dish; adjusted accordingly. I always add cinnamon to the topping and reduce the sugar in the fruit.  Used a bit of agave syrup to cut down on white sugar.

This was a huge success! I used a little too many strawberries so it was a little soupy when it was hot but after setting for a bit it was amazing! Will definitely make again

This turned out very yummy. There's a lot of topping, which we love. You could add extra fruit if you want more fruit than topping, but I loved it just like this.

This is DELICIOUS! I tweaked it as per some reviews (4 cups each of the rhubarb and strawberries, 5 tbsp of flour, 3/4 white sugar, and I added two tsp cinnamon to the topping mix) and it was sooo good with vanilla ice cream. Not too sweet and not too tart. New go to recipe for sure!

This was very good! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and increased the rhubarb and strawberries to 4 cups of each and used 3/4 cup of sugar. I also added 1 tablespoon of fresh-squeezed orange juice and 1 tablespoon of orange zest to the strawberry/rhubarb mixture. I added the full amount of topping, but will try cutting the amount in half the next time I make it as it seemed a little heavy on the topping for my taste. I served this with homemade vanilla ice cream for a delicious summer dessert!

This my first time making & eating rhubarb and I loved it! I did make a few changes to the recipe based on others reviews and what I had on hand. I added an extra cup of strawberries because I had it, decreased the sugar by half, added the zest of 1 orange, 2-3 shakes cinnamon, halved the topping recipe only because I didnt have enough brown sugar, but then added some granola I had to the topping because I was worried about not having enough. Turned out great! We had family over for a birthday bbq and someone thought it looked too good to wait till dessert was served and dug into it early, lol, then we offered for everyone to take some leftovers home and they barely left me 1 tiny serving! So no I need to make this again before rhubarb season is over!!

This recipe proved just what I was looking for.  I didn’t have quite enough strawberries, so I made up the difference with frozen blueberries, &  used 3/4 c white sugar.   Everything turned out delicious.
For my liking  the topping amount was just right.  I don’t like alot of sweetness so I only used 3/4  of the brown sugar.    I cut back the oatmeal just a tad & added a handful of sunflower seeds which I finely chopped & tossed in a bit of wheat germ.

Definitely will make this again.

My second batch of this is in the oven now. I think it is a great recipe. My husband and I could eat a whole pan by ourselves! While I have not altered the recipe yet, my next batch will have more fruit and less topping.

I used half the amount of sweetener in the fruit: half sugar and half Splenda. I used 3/4 cup butter in the topping rather than the full cup and I used brown sugar blend Splenda rather than the brown sugar. The flavors were very good, but I would use half the amount of topping for that amount of fruit next time. I could also cut back a little bit more of the butter.

I will definitely make this again! Following others’ advice, I used 5 tb of flour in the fruit mix (not 3). I think any less than that and it would have been too runny for my taste. I also added one egg yolk since I’ve seen a lot of crumbles that call for one. Next time I may reduce the white sugar to 3/4 cups as well- the strawberries I used were very sweet and I think the rhubarb was ever so slightly drowned out by the other flavors. But this was so good overall! I also used 1/2 cup of almond flour and 1 cup of regular flour in the crumble topping. Not sure if it made a difference to texture or anything; just had some extra almond flour I wanted to use up.

I have made this with rhubarb and strawberries and got raves from my guests. I made it with rhubarb and raspberries and found that equally great (I prefer it over strawberries). The crunch part of the recipes is better than other "crisp" recipes I've tried so it will replace other similar recipes.

I used a big 13X15 pan, upped the fruit (via other reviewers suggestions) PLUS added two giant peaches and added NO SUGAR TO THE FRUIT, left the crunch topping as is written and it was amazing!  Perfect fruit-to-crisp ratio and sweetness was also perfect.  Again: AMAZING!

Very good. This was my first time using rhubarb, and it was a hit. I used the topping from my mom’s apple crisp recipe (for an element of familiarity).

Well I didn't have enough strawberries (and I had to use them up quick) so I added some blueberries along with the rhubarb.  Turned out great.  Used a little less white sugar and a smaller pan but everything is great.  With some ice cream on top it is yummy.

Never made anything with rhubarb before. I made an 8x8 and 4 individual ramekins of this. Turned out delicious! I did sprinkle a cinnamon sugar mix in the top. But the filling was just the right amount of goo and tang. And the topping, I'll cut in half next time. I'll make it again!

I used "treacle sugar" from South Africa-I don't know if this made a difference until i make it with regular brown sugar-but it was AMAZING!  I did add chopped pecans to the crumble but other than those two differences I stuck to the recipe.  So easy and good!

This dessert was so delicious. I made it for a treat for my apartment neighbors and they all gave it a resounding high five. Leftovers did not last long. I will make to have on hand as long as the rhubarb lasts.

I did make some slight changes by doubling the fruit, some cinnamon in both the fruit and topping along with a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Kept the topping the same but only used 3/4 cup brown sugar.  I added 1/2 cup sugar instead of the honey, plus 1 tsp lemon juice to the fruit and it was perfect in tart and sweetness!!

I substituted corn starch for flour for the filling. I also doubled the amount of filling (2 16 ounce packages of fresh strawberries and 4 very large stalks of rhubarb).  I increased the amount of flour for the topping to about 2 cups of flour. Finally, I baked this in a 4 quart rectangular size baking dish.
This came out great and I will definitely make it again.

I made it last night. I used 5 cups of rhubarb and a cup of blueberries. You could definitely use an 8x8 pan instead and an additional 2 tablespoons of flour or corn starch. A few pecans or walnuts in the topping would have given this a nice texture and flavor. The 45 minutes was too long also. I use a thermometer and at 375 timing in 9x13 was 5-10 minutes too long. So much for taking a walk while waiting for 45 minutes to pass. :(

Okay. The comments on the amount of topping being too much were not accurate. I halved the recipe and it was not enough topping. I recommend using all of the topping. 

The topping flavor is excellent but it does need cinnamon and/or vanilla. It's still good the way it is.  Just a little extra spices would be great.

Overall this was a very good recipe. I will say the fruit was a little "loose" even after cooking. It didn't firm up as much as I would have liked, I did use a total of 8 cups of fruit which  was perfect for a 9x11. 

The flavor was outstanding, not overly sweet. I think the amount of sugar is perfect for even the 8 cup portion of fruit.

Wonderful. So much easier than making pie crust. The topping is very crunchy, offsets the softer filling.

It was delicious.  The whole family loved it.  I did follow some of the suggestions and used 5 cups of rhubarb and 5 cups of strawberries.  As well as cutting the sugar to 3/4 of a cup and adding two extra tablespoons of flour (total of 5 tablespoons).  I used all of the crumb topping, exactly as it was in the recipe.  Delicious.  I will be making this over and over again!

I followed comments and added more fruit and the recipe turned out great.  Mine had more strawberries since I didn’t have much rhubarb. I also gave a sprinkle of nutmeg that added more flavor.  Serving it warm is best as well.

Delicious, and not soupy at all!  I let the sugared strawberries and rhubarb sit (the only change -- I used 3/4 C sugar) while I put together the topping.  Made sure to use only  2 TB of the  accumulated juice as I dumped the fruit into the 9x13 dish. That's a rule of thumb when making fruit crisps.  The amount of topping was perfect to offset the amount of fruit.  Note: Only cover leftovers in the baking pan with a light dishtowel, and the topping won't turn to mush.  Crisp it up again before serving leftovers by putting the dish or smaller oven-proof dishes in the oven for 10 minutes at the original baking temperature.  This one got raves and is a keeper, for sure!  Adjust the sugar for early/late season rhubarb and strawberries.  I had early (sweet) rhubarb  from the garden and store-bought, not  local, strawberries...less sweet.

This was delicious. Quite sweet, so if you're not a sweets fan, reduce your sugar in the fruit portion and that will help. Didn't have fresh strawberries, so I used some from my local source that I had stored in the freezer. I also added a few good grates of nutmeg and about 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon to the topping. Used the full topping recipe, we thought it was great so I personally wouldn't change that the next time I make it. Baked as instructed, but in an 11x14 ceramic casserole, took about 50 minutes in my oven. Husband and two year old daughter loved it. I'll be making another for him to take to work and share next week.

Added a pinch of cinnamon to topping. Just fabulous and so easy. Everyone gobbled it up and asked for seconds.

Wonderful spring and summer treat. For personal taste I halved the sugar and used brown sugar instead of while. I also increased the amount of fruits and added to some cinnamon & nutmeg.  We love to accompany it with vanille bourbon ice cream.

Everyone at it up, even scraped the pan.  We'd never even had rhubarb before.  Admittedly, I reduced the amount of rhubarb a little, since I wasn't so sure.  Also, I reduced the amount of the topping, per many others' suggestions.  Should've kept it more.  That stuff's great.  Will be making again.

This dessert was a big hit at our house, even with a picky eater. I topped with whipped cream and ice cream. Both are delicious! Make a lot of servings, so get some help eating it :) Yum!

It was good. I thought it was too much sugar, so I added some more strawberries (mine was about 5 c strawberries and 4 c rhubarb in a 9x13 dish). 1.5 c each flour and oats, 1 c butter, 3/4 c brown sugar. It was good. I will probably use similar fruit ratios next time, but w/o the flour on top of the fruit because it was too gloopy.

I used 5 cups of each fruit, left flour amount the same.  Added a tsp vanilla in with the fruit.   Made topping as written but just added 1/2 cups flax seeds.   This is amazing served warm with vanilla ice cream!!!  I found 45mins at 375 too long and the topping burnt around the edges but it could just  be my oven.

I made it with rhubarb, strawberries and threw in an apple, tsp cinnamon and nutmeg.  Halved the white sugar, added 3 tbsp flour as I had a lot of strawberries and rhubarb.  Cut the topping In half.  Awaiting results.

It was awesome.  Definitely make again

I've made this with 3 cups each of rhubarb & strawberries and on a different occasion  4 cups of each.  Both times I used approximately 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also used about 1 3/4 cups of flour when making the topping.  I also cooked it for 1 hour.

A classic crumble - Tastes awesome but I would say it's not QUITE 5 stars. excellent all the same. The only adjustment I made per other reviewers is adding 4 cups each of strawberries and rhubarb instead of 3. It was the perfect amount for the topping. I also used instant clear gel instead of flour (i do that in all baked fruit desserts). It makes a much better filling consistency.

Simple recipe that my husband loved.  I added a dash of cinnamon because the kids love that.  Also did not have enough rhubarb (hard to find in the stores in my area), so I filled in with extra strawberries.  Worked great.

I had some rhubarb from my garden in the freezer so I used that with fresh strawberries. Because the rhubarb had been blanched and frozen, I added a bit more flour to the fruit mixture to offset the natural liquid it produced. Otherwise, I made the recipe as directed. It turned out great, and more than one person said it was "to die for"!  I will definitely make it again.

The nice thing about this recipe is it's easy to modify. I used 8 cups of rhubarb and 6 cups of strawberries and 1 cup of honey instead of sugar. On the topping I used a little less brown sugar and half the butter. It turned out slightly tart just the way I like it.

I didnt have enough rhubarb or strawberries so I tried to guess at the sugar, flour part. Underestimated and it was a bit sour, but oohhhhh sooooo good. I just sprinkled a bit more on when I got a bowl. Every time I walked through the kitchen, I kept a fork in it and ate a fork full.
Will for sure make again.

With fresh picked strawberries from an Amish neighbor and fresh rhubarb from my garden, this recipe was really flavorful. I changed only one thing in the recipe. Instead of a p flour, I used the ingredients from a box of King Arthur scone mix with orange  and cranberry bits - outstanding!.

I love finding good basic recipes! This one is a winner in my book as it allows you to change it to personal tastes and have the crisp turn out every time. I loved the topping and used the amount called for. My changes included adding cinnamon to the topping and increasing the amount of fruit to four cups rhubarb and four cups strawberries. I have also used blackberries instead of strawberries with wonderful results. I found it best to increase the flour added to the fruit by one tablespoon if you increase the amount of fruit. My guests really loved it!!!!

I couldn't find my grandmother's recipe for strawberry rhubarb crisp yesterday but had a pile of fresh rhubarb and strawberries so decided to give this one a whirl. Amazing as is, but will probably tweak when I make again. The fruit to filling ratio is off, as other reviewers indicated. Will increase  fruit or decrease toping next time. I used a hard boiled egg slicer to make fast and uniform work of slicing the strawberries. This is the kind of good where I tell myself I'll just have a forkful, and by the end of the morning, my sink is full of dirty forks!

I liked this recipe. But I went back to my Mom's 60 year old recipe to really do it right. 
The proportions are right in this recipe but you may need more rhubarb or Strawberries to fill a larger pan. 
The original recipe calls for making the sugar mixture in a sauce pan of sugar, 3T  cornstarch and water. 
The oat mixture is mixed until crumbly. Add 1 tsp of cinnamon. Then  place half and leveled into the bottom of a greased pan to create the crispy crunch bottom crust. 
Next put on fresh cut  Rhubarb and Strawberries. 
At least 3 Cups each. Cut mix and put on Lemon juice or Fruit Fresh to keep beautiful color. Put on bottom crust and level. 
Pour  thickened sugar sauce over fresh fruit in pan and top with  remaining crumbly mix. 
Bake 45-50 @ 350. 
Best when warm with a dallop of vanilla ice cream.

Will not make this again.  Too little filling,  WAY too  much butter and flour in the topping and otherwise very bland.  Lots of better recipes out there that don't need to be totally reworked.  Felt nauseated all evening as did my company.  How embarrassing!

This is SO easy to make, and I love the tartness of the rhubarb with the sweetness of the strawberries! It was absolutely delicious, and I had to stop myself from eating the entire pie pan (I scaled this down to 6 servings, and seriously, I could have eaten the whole thing)! I grew up eating rhubarb, plucked right from the small patch of it growing behind our garage. We'd steal the sugar bowl from the kitchen, and sit on the porch, chomping away! I now live in Georgia, where rhubarb is SO expensive  . . . but I found it at Sprouts Market for $1.99 a bag in the freezer section, and it was perfect! Will be making this one again, for sure!

I'm so excited when fresh rhubarb hits the market. And when I saw this easy recipe, I had to give it a try. I made a couple of adjustments on the fly: I used a slightly smaller baking dish than the recipe called for because I wanted a deep-dish crisp,  I cut back the amount of butter in the topping by 1/4 cup, and I also added a pinch of salt. It turned out so well that it was the first dessert to completely disappear at a community potluck where there were a dozen or so desserts to choose from. I'd call that a success!

First time making for my stepdad, who loves strawberry rhubarb pie. Great alternative! Like others didn't have to add the full sugar and topping was more than enough for an @ 7x10 bar glass dish. On favorites list

Good. Would cut the sugar in half next time, and only use 1/2 cup of flour for topping. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, & 1/4 tsp allspice with a pinch of kosher salt to topping. Since the topping was so powdery, I put pats of butter across the top before baking. I also used 4 cups of frozen chopped/thawed/drained rhubarb & whole strawberries (thawed & drained).

I made this last night and it was delicious!  I made a few changes to the recipe by reducing the amount of sugar in the filling from one cup, to 3/4 cup, as was suggested by other reviewers, and added a chopped apple, (I had one apple sitting on the counter, so I thought "why not"...), to the strawberries and rhubarb mixture. I also substituted 1-1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch for the 3 tablespoons of flour. The consistency and texture of the filling was perfect!  For the topping, I used the amounts noted in the recipe, but substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour, and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a 1/4 cup of chopped pecans. I found the amount of topping the recipe called was perfect for the size of the 9.5 x 13"pan noted it the directions. I suspect some users may have used too small of a pan as there were several comments about there being too much topping. I would not change any of the portions for the topping.  Overall this recipe was great and would highly recommend it with the changes noted.

I tweaked this a bit by adding a splash of vanilla extract.  I think next time I will use more strawberry and rhubarb as they cook down quite a bit and I would like a little more fruit with the topping.  I will make this again..

Fantastic recipe!  We are a gluten free, vegan household that can only eat coconut sugar as a sweetener (okay, stevia is ok but not heat stable). Worked perfectly. I even used this recipe for a peach crisp and just substituted the fruit.  Thank you for such a yummy recipe!

This is really delicious, but I agree with other reviewers, the topping is too much. Halving it is better and I sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg into the four mixture.

Great recipe...the topping is so delicous!  I did use more rhubarb then stated  just because we picked too much from the garden.  I also did as others suggested and decreased the white sugar to 3/4 cup since I like a bit of tartness.  I found that this dish is better if you let it sit and firm up a bit after coming out of the oven.  If you try to serve it right out of the oven, it is runny.

Used 3 cups rhubarb and 3 cups frozen wild blueberries. Way too sweet, and I LOVE sweet. Should have reduced the white sugar by half. I did add vanilla to the flour and oats, which was really good. Also added cinnamon and nutmeg which were also good. Not enough fruit. I would double the fruit and half the sugar next time. The blueberries were also great with the rhubarb.

In a smaller pan, portions are fine.  I happened to have a 10x14 pan, so I doubled the fruit portion (used 6 C each of both the strawberries and rhubarb), but did a single of the topping and it was perfect!  I ended up making this 3x within one week -- it is that good!

Absolutely delicious! Every time I have made this as a dish to pass the pan is always scraped out literally clean. I have always made the dish exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing.

I would definitely make this again, but would up the filling to crumble ratio.  I love a lot of crumble topping, but just a bit more filling would be perfect.

SO SO GOOD. I followed this exactly. I have many of the old family favorites. Moms , grandmas,  recipes that we  make for years, and we love them. These aren't a lot  different. But with all this new internet access we are out there enjoying trying new. This  was very good. Just like moms. Now I store it on line. Not in a box. Iloveit

Made this yesterday and adjusted the quantity to 4 cups of strawberries and 2 cups of rhubarb.  The filling is excellent but there is way too much butter in the crust so it is soggy instead of crispy. I will try again with 1/4 cup or maximum 1/3 cup of butter and am sure the results will be much better.  Tastes great but literally had to drain some of the butter off the top.

This was a great base recipe! I used a few more cups of strawberries, added a splash of lemon extract and added a dash of cinnamon to the crumb mixture.

The strawberry rhubarb combination is too sweet for me, so I did mostly rhubarb with a few blueberries and raspberries tossed in for color.  I served it with vanilla frozen yogurt.  We all had to have seconds.  Yummy!!!

This was yummy. I cut the recipe to 12 servings and made it in a pie plate. The only change I made to the  recipe was to use 2 tsp corn starch rather than flour to thicken the filling. It was delicious. There was a generous amount of topping - which is good if you like topping. I might make it less floury next time. I prefer more of a crunch than a batter. Overall, super simple delicious summer recipe that will wow your diners.

A delicious summertime treat combination of sweet, sour and creamy.   I used less sugar.  A few of my European friends think that American pastries are way to sweet, and I agree.  I also used more strawberries than  rhubarb to give less of an overpowering sour taste.

I made this for our church's weekly meals ministry.  As we feed about 75 people, I quadrupled the recipe.  I had extra strawberries so I ended up using a few more strawberries than the recipe called for, and it was delicious.  It got rave reviews from our guests.

I cut down the sugar and used splenda white and brown sugar.  I also used half of the butter on the topping and added a bit of water to be sure all ingredients were moist.  I also sprinkled a little apple pie spice on top before putting it in to bake.  Baked beautifully and tastes great!

Made this . It was gone  instantly. Sweet but tasty !
I used 3 cups rhubarb and 2 cups strawberries and made the topping just as called for but didn't use it all up.  I made it the next day again and used the left over topping. I used a deep pie plate. It was great first and second time. Will make this again and again

This is there best, easiest crumble you'll find. I've made it twice so far, 13x9 Pyrex both times. Went light on the sugar, added some True Lemon, changed up the fruit/berry/rhubarb mix; i know i used WAY over 5 cups of fruit, that pan was  Next time, I may double there cornstarch to help it thicken a bit more considering the amount of! It was excellent both times. There star here is  the crumble- It's so easy to assemble; then i used so much fruit that i just pressed it into the pan evenly and it was just the right amount. 

For the crumble: I did not halve the recipe, however I did only use 1 stick of butter instead of 2. I think it's much better this way. I also may double the cornstarch to help it thicken up a little better. Also added a little nutmeg, some vanilla, cinnamon, etc. 

Its excellent hot (with a touch of heavy cream...mmm); it's excellent cold; the topping didn't get mushy the next day... Frequently requested, kid approved.

LOVED IT!  LOVED IT!  This was the easiest recipe ever and most flavorful!  As with any recipe, it is a matter of personal taste.  I too added an extra cup of rhubarb and strawberries to the original recipe.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  My rhubarb was extra tart so the cup of sugar was just right.  I topped it with whipped cream but for myself I poured a little heavy whipping cream right over the warm crunch.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

TO DIE FOR!! No kidding.   This is that good.  I followed other suggestions by cutting the topping in half and using an 8X8 dish because I didnt have extra fruit.  Added a touch of nutmeg and a few chopped walnuts just because I had some.  Super recipe!

I love this dessert!  I've made this recipe twice. Once as written and again a week later with one change. Both were super yummy but I preferred this dish with 1/2 cup more strawberries than whats called for. It cuts just enough of the tartness of the rhubarb. Also, be sure to use a 9x13, no substitutes or the topping is too heavy. It needs the space.

I had 22 cups of apples, strawberries and rhubarb, it yielded 3 9x13 pans, 6 to 8 servings each. Definitely double the fruit and halve the sugar, flour and butter. Added 1/2 tbsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp lemon juice to fruit mixture. Added 1/2 tbsp apple pie spice to topping. Basic recipe that needs tweaking to make proportions work.

Best crisp recipe ever. I didn't have enough strawberries so i added an extra cup of rhubarb to make up the difference. It was so yummy.  Didn't make any changes to the recipe. Perfect as is.

Delicious. Made as is. Initially I Thought there was too much topping as so many reviewers said but I used 3/4 of it anyway.  I like crumble top so after it baked and got crispy I thought it was perfect. Hubby raved and had 2 huge helpings. Picky daughter even really liked it. I harvested  strawberries and rhubarb from my own garden to make this :)

This is a crowd pleaser!  And, I enjoyed it too!

I read the previous reviews so I had four cups each of strawberries and rhubarb.  The topping was just the right amount.  There was quite a bit of liquid which, I think, is why the crisp was not actually crunchy.  I think next time, I may add some toasted nuts to the crisp.

I love rhubarb. This was a learning experience for me as I tend to cut the rhubarb too fine which results in a soupy crisp. Next time I will add orange, cinnamon and nutmeg as someone suggested. I didn't use all the crumb topping which means I'll have to make another crisp. DELICIOUS!!!

Will make this again BUT I would change out the 3T of flour in the strawberry rhubarb mix to 3T of instant tapioca and cut back the flour in the crumble by half and replace with oats.  I'm not a fan of using flour as a thickener much prefer the texture of the tapioca.

I had some leftover fresh strawberries from last year that I had froze and wanted to use them with the fresh rhubarb I had picked. I think that having the frozen strawberries helped this recipe from being gluey as others complained about in other reviews. I drained my berries from the liquid first, but it still left them with some extra juice. Followed this recipe EXACTLY other than using the frozen berries. It was PERFECT! Rave reviews from everyone who tried it. Would definitely make this again soon!

This was the best!! 

This is one of  the tastiest,  quickest , no fail, (well, that depends upon the quality of your ingredients) and easiest dessert ever!! Great for kids to make!! 

I have now made this 6 times. It has been a super request  at home, potlucks and for Teacher's Appreciation Week. 

 I have adjusted the sugar each batch to the sweetness level of the strawberries, but that is a no brainer. 

Here in Alaska we are able to grow some tasty rhubarb! Yummm

This is very good.  I did adjust some things to more of our liking; 6 stalks of rhubarb (approx. 4C, cut in half lengthwise and diced with scissors), 2 lbs of strawberries (approx. 6C) and only 3/4 C sugar.  Didn't change the topping - mixed that up in the food processor.  Put in two 9" cake pans for 45 minutes.  Served with vanilla ice cream.  So yummy!

Used only a third of sugar with strawberries & rhubarb and none with topping (though will try a tad next time for the texture). Added almond extract & nutmeg. Outstanding! Everyone liked it; will make this way again.

Love this recipe!!! Super easy. I made a few changes for mine. First I added a store bought crust and lined the 9x13 and baked it for 12 minutes. Then, I only used 2 cups rhubarb to decrease the tart taste for my kids. Finally, doubled the topping ingredients (all but the butter). Bake 40 minutes. Fabulous!

Delicious, but I found I only needed half as much topping (I froze the rest for later use) and next time I will probably add some cinnamon to the topping.

Made it and loved it exactly as the recipe is stated, so here is true review!  This is a perfect combination of tart and sweet.  Since there is no botom crust I think the fruit portion is right on.  No spices needed.  Super easy to make.

As written, I would think it was just OK.  As a recipe to improve, then it was helpful.  It definitely needed more fruit, 1 cup more of  both rhubarb and strawberries.  I would put in 1 TBS tapioca flour in addition to the regular flour, and at least 1 tsp of cinnamon to give the fruit more depth in flavor. As far as the topping,  3/4 C butter would be adequate , along with the other ingredients.  I'd also put a tsp of cinnamon in the topping.  By the time I was finished, it was a 5 star recipe.  The group loved it and wanted my recipe!  One other recommendation,  remember to sit the 9 x 13 pan on perhaps a covered in tin foil cookie sheet in case the fruit bubbled over.  The fruit amount might be adequate in the recipe if you used a smaller pan, but in a 9 x 13", it would have 3/4" of fruit when baked.  It would look skimpy.  When I was finished with my changes, this was a 5 star crisp!

Yum, yum, yum! There is a lot of topping. When we put the dish in the oven, the topping was only about 1/3 the thickness of the entire dish' but after baking, because the fruit cooked down so much, the topping was more like 3/4 of the thickness of the dish. My family did not mind at all ;) but I would use less topping next time. (We didn't even use all the topping; we put some aside - about a cup - to bake on top of berries later this week.)

Delicious. I listened to other reviewers and cut the topping amount in half. I think half was just a bit too little. I'd cut it down to 2/3 next time.

SO good!  The top crunch is to die for.  I used fresh picked strawberries and rhubarb.  While there's a ton of sugar and butter in this recipe, it's so worth it.  I carefully measured my fruit and when I put it in a 9 x 13 pan I thought I could have used the next size down, but stuck with the recommended size because there's plenty of crunch topping.  This is a real summer treat!

Perfect time of year to make this with rhubarb and strawberries in season.  Used 4 cups each of rhubarb and strawberries and used Splenda instead of sugar, reducing the amount by one quarter.  It was delicious and a big success in my house.  Thanks for this recipe.

Very yummy! Took about 10 mins longer than the recipe stated to crisp up but I did add extra fruit as others mentioned. I am really glad I did because it likely would not have been enough as the layer was a little thin even with extra. Overall a good recipe and will make again!

I read reviews first....I did 4 cups of each fruit, and I added a splash of real vanilla. Very good! I am pleased with this recipe, and I think even if I had used 3 cups of each....would have been great. we like the topping so more would be fine...but I had 3 huge stalks of rhubarb that chopped into 4 cups....so... :) YUM!

The flavor is very good but I would like more oats.  It was to much like eating pie filling without any crust.

Very good and easy.  Used my frozen chopped rhubarb and frozen whole strawberries that I thawed just enough to slice. Added walnuts to the top of the rhubarb & strawberry mixture.  Served with ice cream.  Delicious! !

I used 5 c strawberries and 5 c rhubarb, 5 tablespoons flour with fruit, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and sprinkled nutmeg on top and it all fit in a 9 x 13. I made the topping as noted just added more oats but split it and pressed half into the bottom of a greased pan and put the other half on top. It was amazing!!

Fantastic, I added 2 cups more strawberries because I had them and used more than 1/2 whole wheat flour in the recipe. Just like my Indianan grandma used to make.

Although the recipe called for 3 cups rhubarb, I used all I had which was about 4 cups. I used almost 4 cups strawberries, too. All I have to say is DELICIOUS! Topped this dish with homemade whipped topping! Can't wait to eat more.

This was very tasty! I think I over chopped mine because apron serving it appeared to be just a lot of crust! it still tasted great cause I think the topping absorbed the bottom :)

Oh yes, this is a delicious and very quick way to make a lovely rhubarb dessert.  Company was already coming through the gate; I'd just finished cutting up the rhubarb & strawberries...  While a guest was watching me, I just threw the fruit right into the baking dish with the flour and sugar.  Then, as we chatted, I put the rest of the ingredients in to a large bowl and blended with my pastry blender.  Exception:  added only ONE cube of butter (1/2 C) vs. two and a little milk for moisture.  Tossed the mixture on top and put it in the oven, setting the timer.  Dinner was just over and buzzzzzz.  Warm, fabulous dessert ready!  "Would you like vanilla ice cream or salted caramel with your crunch?"  There was a lot of silence and chewing and mmmmming during dessert.  :-D  THANKS, MICHELLE!

I did not have enough strawberries, so I supplemented them with blueberries. Delicious! I also cut the butter by 1/4 and used dark brown sugar rather than light and it was fine. As others mentioned this is a LOT of topping! I would at least double the fruit for a better crumble-fruit ratio. Unless you're like me and you're mostly there for the crumble, not the fruit!

I like my desserts less sweet so I used half the white sugar with the fruit.  Other than some ground flax and sub 1/2c white for Brown sugar the rest was as written.  I baked on the warming tray (is that what it is called?) In my bbq.  I liked the filling but found the topping did not crisp up very well, was thick and too floury for my tasre, I prefer more of an oatmeal consistency.  I might try again but use less flour, more oatmeal, snd less topping altogether.   It did taste fine warm with ice cream just not a re-do as-is for me.

My family LOVED this recipe!  My husband, who is not big on sweets, said it's the best rhubarb dish he's ever tasted. This will be a regular dish. I'm going to try and double the recipe next time and see how it goes. I'd like it to be a little thicker.

I tried this today, all the ingredients seemed to be good as is, but with a diabetic in the house I used Splenda for the sugar and based on the other reviews I cut the sugar back to 3/4, but with Splenda I don't think I would cut back again.  Was delicious though, the crunch came out perfectly, as I had to do the old fashioned way with a fork vs a pastry cutter

Great made as is.  Made two times in one week.  The second time I used frozen berries and fresh rhubarb.  I also cut down to 3/4 cup of white sugar.  Tasted great both ways especially with ice cream or whipped cream.

Wonderful! However. I used Stevia powder instead of the white sugar-- drops the calories a lot. Stevia is perfect for diabetics as it has no calories AND is all natural. No chemicals as in Sugartwin. I don't see any recipes using Stevia and I wonder why no one has recommended it. Even the Canadian Diabetic Assoc. hasn't heard of it. If you have family members who can't have sugar, use Stevia in any recipe calling for sugar. The measurements of the powder are the same as for sugar.

We enjoyed this recipe and my boyfriend was almost licking his bowl. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 c and it was sweet enough and quite tart. I kept the amount of rhubarb, strawberries, and flour the same and consistency of the filling was just right. For the topping I reduced all the ingredients by half and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, some pumpkin pie spice, and some chopped pecans. I still had extra filling leftover so I may make less next time and add more cinnamon. It turned out to be a great dessert especially with some homemade vanilla ice cream on top!

Very easy. Cut the topping stuff in half per other reviews and still had plenty. Could add a little more fruit next time.

I have made this several times and love it.  I do add cinnamon to my crisp mixture and everybody raves about my "secret" ingredient. This is a family favorite recipe. Thanks so much for sharing it.

This was just a fruit crisp.  If you have a favorite fruit crisp recipe then just use that.  I can't rate this higher because I followed the directions of other reviewers and agree that I cannot see how the original recipe could have worked. I added a small amount of cinnamon but if I were to make it again I would add lots of cinnamon and nutmeg and maybe grind up some pecans to jazz up the topping.  This was good but nothing spectacular.

Yum! I read the reviews and saw there was too much crunch so I tried to put some on the bottom of my pan.   I used a glass pan, and the crunch stuck a bit.  Overall, the taste was superb.  I will definitely make this again, but tweak it a bit to better portion the crunch.

Tried this last night on the bbq.  After grilling steaks and shrimp, we left the grill on low and put the 9x13 pan on the top rack/indirect heat while we ate. After 45 minutes (at about 350 degrees)the crisp was perfect, and done just in time!  I followed reviewer's recipe which raised the quantities of fruit to 4 cups each and flour to 5 tbs.  I sprinkled the top with a bit of cinnamon too!  Yummy!

Made this today with the first sweet strawberries of the season and fresh rhubarb from the farmers' market, and served it with vanilla ice cream. Totally delicious! We halved the recipe and used a 9" diameter glass pie dish and it turned out just fine. In future I might make a little bit less topping and use a little less sugar in the filling for a tarter taste, but this is a seriously delicious dessert.

Also, this is a great recipe to make with kids. My 3.5-year-old helped put the fruit in the bowl and mix it all up, and she had a fabulous time.

I thought it was GREAT!  I used frozen strawberries from last summer.  I thawed them out and dumped off the juice.  I also drizzled melted caramel sauce over the top.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect.  Everyone loved it!
Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Everyone in my family loves this dessert, couldn't wait for rhubarb season to do it again. I reduce both brown and white sugar by a 1/3 of a cup each and the result is fantastic!

I made this yesterday and it was sooo good warm from the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  My husband had 2 servings. Personally, I thought the recipe might be a tad bit better with more fruit, but my husband disagrees.

I'm not much of a "traditional" breakfast eater--cereal, fruit, toast, etc.  I often have leftovers for breakfast.  The crunch was still great after being in the fridge last night.  This recipe is definitely a "keeper" and will be a great recipe to take to "pot-lucks" or family gatherings.

The flavor was great however it wasn't as thick as I prefer so next time I will bake in an 8x8 pan for thicker pieces. I reduced the butter to 3/4 cup and it was perfect. It would be really good with 1/2 tsp cinnamon in the strawberry mixture and sliced almonds added to the topping.

Terrific! Used whole wheat flour and added 1/8 cinnamon.  Tasted no different that white flour.  Made with rhubarb only (the red ends only).  Awesome straight out of the oven with vanilla ice cream!

Great recipe!  I made this a few times and everyone loves it.  I would recommend increasing the rhubarb and strawberries to 4 cups each.  I also added a pint of blackberries which I plan on using again because it really added something to the dessert.  The recipe made plenty of topping and I sprinkled chopped pecans over it then baked, it came out perfect especially with a scoop of ice cream. Thanks

I used only 1/4 cup white sugar and the strawberries were super ripe.  Husband said it was tart, but refreshingly so.  Great recipe overall, if your family can handle less sugar, try it!

I tried this receipe today for my bible study group. It was a hugh success. A great way to use Rhubarb. The only thing I did different,
like others suggested was to add a little extra fruit. Bake and enjoy, I did and I'm not sorry I did.

This was soooo great tasting! I used local frozen strawberries and rhubard (I followed suggestions from others and used extra fruit) and it turned out perfect. Just make sure you strain your frozen berries well before using.

This is a 3.5 star recipe but I'm rounding down because my expectations were so high and I was left somewhat disappointed. As per other reviewers I increased the fruits to about 5 cups each, and thank goodness I did because otherwise it would have been way too measly. The crumb topping, which is normally the best part of these desserts, was just mediocre. It was NOT crunchy, as the name would lead you to believe, and it tasted overwhelmingly of flour. In fact the fruit part tasted of flour too. There is just way too much flour in this recipe. I think 1 tbsp would be plenty for the fruit--who cares if it's a little juicy?--and then I'd use a crumb/crisp topping from some other recipe. But don't get me wrong, I still wolfed this down.

I've made this twice, and BOTH times it was GREAT. The first time in a 9x9x2 dish with the called-for proportions, which just made for a deeper crust topping--crunchy on top with a more dense pastry like underside, and the second time in a 9x13 with ever so slightly more fruit (maybe 1/2 C) but the same amount of crumble topping.  The only thing I adjusted was cooking time (abt 30 min vs. 45), but this could be the result of a less than accurate older electric oven.

I made this with 4 cups of rhubarb and 4 cups frozen strawberries, that I thawed.  Kept the sugar the same since the strawberries were not fresh.  Used the bar pan it was perfect!

All my guests loved this dish.  Changes I would make in the future is add another cup or two of both strawberries and rhubarb.  I felt like there was way too much crunch and hardly a layer of the strawberry rhubarb.

Strawberries and rhubarb are always a great combination... all the fuss in the other reviews had my worried about the topping... it is supposed to be a crunch not a crisp or anything else... it is supposed to have a lot of topping... I cut everything in the topping in half except for the rolled oats... mine turned out good... if you really want you can add cinnamon but I think it was let plain to focus the flavor on the rhubarb and the strawberries.... I would recommend increasing the amount of rhubarb and strawberries to at least 4 cups though and leaving the sugar the same or even cutting it back if your strawberries are really ripe... I am not sure what I would recommend about the topping if you want a crunch I don't recommend cutting back on it but just increase the fruit...  the way I made it turned out good with good flavor...

My family loves strawberry-rhubarb pie, but somehow they tend to always come out a bit too runny. This recipe tastes perfect and comes out better than a pie. I made it for family and they loved it, so when we had a special occasion I made it again and doubled the recipe for family and friends. The result was a smashing success. It was gone before most other desserts. Love it!

Excellent and simple.  Perfect the way it is.  Not too much topping.  I've owned my own bakery, I am 58 years old.  I just decided to add blueberries and walnuts to the mix and a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  So quick and easy.

This is SO GOOD! I add more fruit, and make 1/2 again more topping. This time I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the topping as I mixed it up. This is my "go-to" easy, Delicious springtime recipe!

I added about a cup or more of frozen blueberries.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  While baking it looked like too much liquid but it set up nicely.  I see what others are saying about too much crumble but we love the crumble so we thought it was perfect and delicious.  My toddler, preschooler, husband and I all loved it.

Delicious!  I didn't change the recipe but did increase the amount of fruit.  This one will be at the top of our make for company and for ourselves.  I found by increasing the amount of fruit we didn't have an excess of topping.

Really delicious, but I found there was too much sugar, even with half the sugar needed in the crunch topping. Probably would be better with half the sugar in the rhubarb and none in the crumble.

Added cinnamon to the crumble and really enjoyed that!

Awesome recipe! Best topping ever!  I made it as described and then again using a little more flour in the filling as the first time the filling was a bit runny. Since then, I also used sliced apples instead of strawberries and it was awesome!  Since I love rhubarb, I will try with just rhubarb next time (probably need more sugar for that), but I think this topping is perfect!  I don't think it's too much, but then I love the crunchiness of it.  Other rhubarb/fruit combinations I've used for pies include rhubarb with mixed berries (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries), and rhubarb with just blueberries, all very good.

Made as is, and it was great! Served with French Vanilla ice cream, and it was gone.
Will make again, only I will add more fruit. Thanks Michelle for sharing this.

This was DELICIOUS!!! However, it could be because I tweaked the given recipe to what TRindell suggested and I totally agree with their amounts of ingredients. To balance the amount of fruit to topping (making no changes to the topping) you should really add 4 or even 5 cups each of rhubarb and strawberries. I also added less sugar because my strawberries were good and ripe! The rhubarb I used was previously chopped and froze and it still turned out AMAZING!!

I took this to work and it disappeared.  Everyone raved and I had to share the recipe.  The only change I will make next time is to reduce the sugar in the recipe to 3/4 cup.  I must have had some super sweet rhubarb and strawberries because the filling was really sweet, but overall an excellent recipe.  Thank you for the post...

This recipe turned out very nicely Thank you! I am all about presentation and I added a half a pack of strawberry jello to the rhubarb and strawberries instead of flour. I found it set much nicer and the jello added bright red color! Fantastic with a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in the flour mix as well!

With 2 cups of sugar and a cup of butter, I HAD to look at the calorie/fat count. Seemed way too low: then saw the "18" servings. From a 9x13 pan? And then add a scoop of ice cream? And who would have just that one tiny slice? So, sorry, I had to give it one star for being misleading.

I've made this for years. Love it. When the rhubarb starts growing in the garden, this is the recipe I start yearning for. Adding vanilla sounds like a great idea. My co-workers request this, even the one who did't likw rhubarb. Now she makes it herself too.

After reading many of the reviews, it looked like most people thought 3 tbsp of flour in the filling was too much and there was twice as much topping as necessary.  So I lowered the flour in the filling to 2 tbsp (I was using frozen rhubarb, which can release a lot of water as it cooks, so I didn't want to go lower than that) and I cut the topping in half.  The 2 T flour worked well with the frozen rhubarb, but I wish I had followed the recipe as written for the topping and not cut it in half.  That was my children's favorite part, and when I cut it in half, it barely covered the 9x13 pan (with bits of strawberry and rhubarb poking through).  Next time I would use the full topping amount.  I'd rather have too much of it than not enough.  This is the first recipe I've found where my son actually ate some of the rhubarb instead of eating around it, thanks!

Fantastic! I used the filling to crust ratio as written and thought it was fine. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 c., and added some cinnamon and vanilla to the crust for a little added flavor. Marvelous.

I make this recipe exactly and it is a huge hit in my house and with all of our friends. Many people ask for the recipe. People who aren't too sure about rhubarb love it as well. This is a must have every time rhubarb is in season. Can't wait for it to come next year!

This was really good.  The strawberries really overpowered the rhubarb as you couldn't taste it at all.  It was good served with vanilla bean ice cream.  Next time I will add a little cinnamon to the crust.

I made this for a family reunion and it went fast! It was the only dessert to be eaten all up! Don't expect leftovers if you make this, it's delicious!  To make it even better, while it is still warm, top with some vanilla ice cream.

I will definitely make this again!  I did make one substitution, I used whole grain flour.  I think it gave the crisp a more earthy flavor, but still sweet and delicious.

This was a huge hit with my family and my husband is VERY PICKY!  I changed just a few things:  cut the sugar to 3/4 cup as recommended by others, added more strawberries, because I had a little more than the recipe called for, used the topping recipe that was recommende (1c flour, 1c brown sugar, 1 c oatmeal, 1/2 c butter) and it was delicious!  I halved the recipe because there are only three of us, but it worked beautifully and it will be made again, I'm sure!  Great recipe!!

I followed all adjustments by TRindell and it turned out perfectly!  I used 3/4C sugar and it was just sweet enough.  Although I did forget the tip about foil on the bottom of the oven to catch the overflow... that would have been helpful!

Nice Crisp!  I didn't want to make a pie with two crusts and all.  This was much simpler.  I followed the directions, though I am in the habit of adding extra fruit and flour for thickening to all recipes.  Came out very nice.  My son loved.  My only concern was the crisp part. The amount of butter (1Cup) was way more than my comfort zone, so next time I will use my apple crisp topping.    TOPPING (Could Double the Crust) Use one on top and one on bottom    •	1 cup Oats (1/2 quick and ½ thick cut oats) •	1 cup all-purpose flour •	1 cup packed brown sugar •	1/4 teaspoon baking powder •	1/4 teaspoon baking soda •	1/2 cup butter •	1 tsp. cinnamon •	½ Cup  Pecans if desired Thanks for the beautiful flavors

Strawberry and rhubarb season is upon us!  I made this recipe exactly as called for and it was delicious!  Why cheat yourself out of the topping or the sweetness of it when you are eating dessert anyway!  Definately a great way to use excess strawberries and rhubarb!  Thank you!

Very good.  Can see how you may want to cut back on the sugar slightly, but it could be because we had local berries (northern new york--very red and yummy) vs what you buy at the market.

This was super yummy!  My new favorite fruit desert!  I didn't change anything except making half the servings and using a 9x9 pan. I did use fresh from the garden strawberries and rhubarb (not store bought) so I am sure that helped, but I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.   I will be making this again and again!

This was delicious and I didn't adjust a thing. Everyone went back for seconds! My husband has claimed to loathe rhubarb forever, but I think I might have made a believer of him! Will certainly consider this a summer dessert staple.

Good basic recipe. Have been making a form of this for years from an old Farm Journal magazine recipe as follows: Crust: one cup flour, one cup oatmeal, one stick butter. Mix these ingredients and pat one half of crumbs into a sprayed 9x9" pan. Pre bake bottom crust for 10-15" minutes at 375. While baking bottom crust cook one cup sugar, one cup water and 2-3 tbsp. cornstarch on top of stove over medium heat stirring constantly until clear.  Cool slightly add one tsp. good vanilla and if desired 2-4 tbsp. dry strawberry jello SF or regular. Place four cups rubarb over bottom crust, pour syrup filling over fruit.Cover with rest of oatmeal, flour, butter mixture.Bake at 375 for 45" until bubbles in middle and crust is golden.  May use this recipe for any fruit and pour cooked syrup, (or glace) as the stores fancily call the ready made product for several dollars, over raw fruit.  May add cinnamon to crust mixture if desired.  May use different flavors of jello depending on fruit used. Enjoy this "old" recipe. May double recipe and place in a 9x13" pan.

YUM!!! I did cut the butter in half just to save on fat, but followed the rest of the recipe.  I thought that there would be too much crunch topping, but it was soooooooo good and my hubby loved it.  I served this with vanilla bean ice cream -- a definite keeper!

I thought this was really good, but I would cut down on the sugar in with the fruit as it was a little too sweet, maybe to 3/4C.  I would also cut down the amount of butter in the crumb topping. I found that it made the topping more like oatmeal cookie dough than crumbs.  I even added some more flour and oatmeal to it.  I had to break apart the clumps to put it on top of the strawberry/rhubarb mixture in the pan. I have an apple crisp recipe that uses 1 cup each of flour, oatmeal and brown sugar and 1/2 cup of butter.  That always works out well for me. It did get nice and crunchy and yummy, though.

This came out great. The only difference I did was use 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup. I suppose it all just depends on how tart the rhubarb and how sweet the strawberries are. Adjusting the sugar is all up to your liking. Tasted great with vanilla ice. The topping is perfect as is. Also, the house smelled great when I was baking this!

I used about 3/4 cup of sugar, thanks to the reviews I saw here.  I baked mine in a 9 x 9 inch deep dish...and it was fabulous!!  I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to give the topping a little extra, and since I had an extra cup of rhubarb left over I put that in too.  Everything worked beautifully, and my husband is still raving.

This was delicious!  However in a 9 x 13 pan it was very flat.  I will add at least 2 more cups of fruit next time and cut back on the sugar a little.  I did add 1 t. of cinnamon to the crust because I'm a cinnamon lover.  Very good recipe and definitely a keeper for me.

I left the flour completely out of the filling, halved the butter in the topping, served with vanilla ice cream, and it was delicious!

Yum.  I didn't have any strawberries so I mixed 2 cups chopped royal gala apples (skin on) wit 4 cups rhubarb - turned out great.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I found the crumble topping too light and airy - I prefer a richer, denser more crunchy sweet topping.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and loved it! I didn't think the ratio was bad at all. I love the fruit and the topping and this was perfect with some vanilla ice cream on it. WONDERFUL! I'm adding to this to say that I love this even more after realizing how versatile it is. I have put rhubarb, blueberries, strawberries, apples, all combined into this and it turns out delicious each time. I'm so happy to have this recipe.

This was really good! I made a slight alteration by first cooking the strawberries and rhubarb in a mixture of water, sugar, and cornstarch. End result was outstanding. Would definitely make this again.

It was awesome and I didn't even have fresh ingredients. It was really good with a bit of vanilla ice cream to calm it down. I didn't change the recipe at all.

Awesome recipe. Didn't have enough strawberries or rhubarb, so I added some thawed frozen blackberries as well. Can hardly wait to make it this summer with vanilla ice cream.

Very good.  Followed directions exactly, although dough was not dry enough so I ended up adding more flour and brown sugar.

Delicious and easy and a big hit at my house. I recommend at least 4 1/2 cups of rhubarb and strawberries. Use a larger pan. There is plenty of crunch for this amount of fruit.

I was mainly looking for a recipe for a crumb topping.  I made this topping for a pie of fresh strawberries.  It was delicious the first time we ate it.  The next day, after heating up the leftovers, it was even better!  The topping was slightly too sweet for my taste but my family had no problem with the sweetness.

This was extremely yummy. My rendition had a greater ratio of strawberries to rhubarb, and oats to flour, but that is a matter of taste. It held together very nicely and looked beautiful.

This was good. My family really likes anything with Rhubarb and strawberry. The topping was a little chunky, but add some vanilla ice cream and it was yummy.

Great with a few additions.  I used almost 4 cups each of the strawberries and rhubarb.  I also added 1 teas of cinnamon to both the filling and the topping, and cut the flour in the topping down to 1 cup after reading previous reviews about the topping being a little pasty.  I also added the zest of one orange to the filling.  Served warm with Vanilla Bean ice cream...perfect!

I did this as Debi S had recommended, with her modifications, except went a bit liberal on both fruits and only used 1 tsp. cinnamon in the topping, no nutmeg, cloves or nuts.  It was good!
When I do it again, I will up the fruit by at least 1 cup each, adjust the flour and sugar accordingly.  I felt that there was a lot of topping for the fruit, would have preferred more fruit. 
Tasty, though! Thanks Debi!

I am being generous with giving this recipe 3 stars because perhaps it is the rhubarb taste that we didn't care for (although I like strawberry/rhubarb pie). I added 5 cups of strawberries and 3 cups of rhubarb to balance out the excess topping.  This recipe was okay, but I found it to be a bit pasty (too much flour) and bitter.  Half of the dish remained untouched in the fridge and will be tossed.  I will find a better use for 8 cups of expensive fruit in the future.

I don't see that anyone else had this issue, but the amount of crumb topping was insufficient for this dessert. I might use the same proportions but cook it in an 8*8 to increase the fruit to topping ratio. I also added a tbsp. of lemon juice to the fruit. Perhaps using 4 cups strawberry, 2 cups rhubarb would be better.

This was not only my first experience cooking with rhubarb, this was my first taste of rhubarb.  I LOVE IT!!  Great recipe, though I made a few changes.  I took the advice of previous posters and increased the fruit and added chopped nuts to the topping.  Thanks for a great recipe I will make again and again.

Excellent!  I made a few modifications, though.  I used more strawberries (2-16 oz. packages, quartered) and I used a little more butter, 1 c. plus 3 tbsp.  The crumble was just too floury with only one cup of butter.

This is the best, I make it often.  Frozen rhubarb works well.  I sometimes sub margarine for the butter, although I do like butter better.

This recipe is great!  It was all gone the first night it was made!  I didn't use as much sugar as the recipe called for as suggested by others.

Really, really good stuff!
I didn't have white sugar so I used brown and less of it. Next time I might add some walnuts to the topping as well??

This was very good.  I took the advice of others and only used 1/2 cup of sugar and personally I could have used a little more.  I'll probably go with 3/4 cup next time.  I also just used 1/2 cup butter on the topping and that worked perfectly!  I also sprinkled cinnamon on the top.

Thank you so much.

Very good. Like others, I found that there was too much topping. Next time I'll make only half the topping, and add less sugar to the fruit mixture. With those minor alterations, I'm sure it will receive 5 stars.

Good recipe.  I added more rhubarb and strawberries which was good...wouldn't have wanted any less.  But with the added fruit, it could probably have used a bit more sugar...was a bit tart.  But very good...will make again.

I've made it twice, both times halving the sugar added to the strawbery mixture and adding a cup more strawberries, just to cut down on the sugar. I made the topping as directed and both times it was fantastic!!

This is delicious! I only used 1 cup of flour and a little less than 1 cup of brown sugar. I only used 1/2 cup of butter and it turned out wonderfully! Wish the fruit was a little thicker..maybe will use a little bit more rhubarb next time. Thanks so much!

Very Good, but requires a lot of prep work! 
about 3/4 of the way through, I hoped it was all worthwhile, and it was, however, Rhubarb is difficult to cut. 


Tasty, and I will make this again, but, not something when you are rushed!

This is great.  I didn't use all the topping and added a little more rhubarb.  I also put it in a small pan because I like the fruit to be thick.  It was wonderful.

Not as good as a plain rhubarb crunch recipe I also got from this site. In fact I was a little disappointed with this one after reading the great reviews. The strawberries made this dessert very soupy and the rhubarb wasn't cooked enough. I'm glad I served my other rhubarb cruch recipe to company and ate this one myself because it didn't look nearly as good.

the flavors of the filling and crust are good, the only problem is the proportion of filling Vs. crumble. there's not enough filling. the next time i make  this i'll make either 1 1/2 times more filling or less of the crumble.  
But overall it tastes Fantastic!

I loved this recipe!  Next time I make it, I would add more fruit.  I  had too much topping for the amount of fruit.  Great taste, though.

This is truly wonderful, a combination of rhubarb and strawberries. Will make again and again.

A friend gave me some rhurbarb which needed to be used, so I wanted to make a treat to take to my Bible study group.  Didn't have time after work to make a pie crust, so threw this together and the ladies loved it!!  Topped with vanilla ice cream..yummy!

I have tried other rhubarb recipes and they usually call for too much sugar. I found this recipe to be just right, not to sweet and not to tart.
