Other than cutting the recipe in half, I made them exactly as directed. Baking time was perfect at 9 minutes for my oven. These are exactly as the submitter describes "crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside." One word of caution is that they do spread quite a bit. They will puff up while baking, and then flatten out, pretty thin, so make sure you space them apart accordingly. I used a small cookie scoop, and my first pan I placed them too close together, and they all ran into each other. If using a half sheet pan, only go 3 across the width, and no more than 4 lengthwise. They are very tasty, and go perfect with a cup of tea.
