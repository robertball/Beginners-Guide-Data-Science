I used crimini mushrooms (baby bellas) and followed the recipe as written. I would maybe have preferred to have the pasta a little more done and I did think it lacked a little moisture---maybe water from the pasta. Balsamic vinegar does tend to make pasta look a little weird but it does make it taste good. You could always use white balsamic vinegar as an alternative. Thanks thesmiths!

Meal was excellent but needed some modifications for future use. Based on the other reviews I agree it was a bit dry even though I added about a 1/4c butter to the mushrooms after adding the balsamic to create a bit of a sauce. Next time I will double up the balsamic and let it cook with the mushrooms for a little and add the butter to get a little more of a balsamic taste when mixed with the pasta.

I just tried this over lettuce instead of pasta. It was fantastic! I'll definitely try it over pasta next time.

Just ok. Made recipe with half the pasta amount that was called for and it was too dry. My husband and I both ate it but I would not make it again.

There was way too much pasta for me. The flavor was great but nothing like the one I had. Oh well.

This was a very simple but very delicious dish although be warned Romano is a very strong cheese both in smell and taste. To mild the flavor of the Roman you might want to so half the required amount and for the other half substitute it for a milder cheese like mozzarella.

Excellent! And easy to make. The only change made is I used shaved parmigiana reggiano cheese as I was unable to locate the one from recipe. Must be the basil!

Yummy!  Made it exactly as per the recipe except added a little of the pasta water to the mushroom mixture to make it a little moister.  We will be making again.
