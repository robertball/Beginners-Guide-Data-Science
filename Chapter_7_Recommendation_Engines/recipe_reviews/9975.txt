Overall, this is a keeper of a recipe.  However, I had to make some adjustments as I went along.  First, make sure that the eggs that you use are large, or extra-large, otherwise you will have to use a little water to make the pastry the right consistency to pat into the mini muffin pan.  Also, I added a pinch of salt to both the pastry dough, and the filling.  It's kind of cumbersome to work with one pan as I did...if I make this recipe again, which I probably will, I will invest in another muffin tin, that way I can bake the shells all at the same temperature, and then lower the temp for the filling.  Otherwise, this is a very nice recipe to fill in your holiday cookie tray!

Wonderful - big hit!! Don't forget to have some halved pecans on hand for the tops - the list of ingredients leaves this out.  I add a pinch of salt, and decrease the almond extract to 1/2 tsp - the almond flavor is a bit overpowering. *Note that the recipe says to decrease the temperature when baking with the filling* - it's easy to overlook that instruction.  Also, it helps to separate the dough before shaping it (makes exactly 24 shells). I have made these several times, and I now cut the filling ingredients in half because I end up with so much left over (tastes great warmed over vanilla ice cream though!).  A very pretty way to serve them is to place them on a large white platter, and arrange blueberries and whole strawberries with the stems around them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were quite alot of work for the outcome.  I liked the tarts, but you really have to stay on top of these.  

I only cooked the shells for 5 minutes (dot of brown in center), or they were compeletely burnt after the second bake.

Once I got the cook time down, they turned out great.

These tarts were great!  My whole family and my church loved them! I lined the muffin tins with tiny muffin cups to make it less messy and they turned out fine.  Great recipe and a very attractive dessert!

My first time with pecan tarts.  I should have realized when mixing the crust that the crust is more cookie-like than pie-crust-like.  My crust was a little hard, probably due to over-baking.  As mentioned by another reviewer, the ingredient list does not list 'pecan halves'.  Fortunately, I had a bunch of pecans in the freezer and was able to select enough presentable halves.  I used a twenty-four section mini-muffin pan and felt that my crust was a bit thick in places in the bottom.  Had the crust been thinner, I would have had many more than twenty-four.  I had at least half the filling left, so...?  The taste of the crust and filling was very good.  For those who try this recipe as first-timers, just be aware of the quantities/ratio of crust and filling.

I didn't realize that this recipe was for the mini muffin cup pan and since I had some regular sized frozen tart shells in my freezer I used them instead and just followed the rest of the recipe from the filling on. However, I made a mistake and filled them without baking the shells first and ended up having to bake the filled tarts for 25 minutes. Not that it was such a bad thing, in fact we liked them even better, they turned out really chewy like candy and the filling baked into the pastry part and gave the crust a really nice taste.(they were a little difficult to get out of the aluminum shell though because they bubbled slightly over the edge - had to use a fork - so I wouldn't make them like this for company) I will try these again, but bake the pastry part first to see the difference. It made 7 regular sized tarts.

Very easy to make and very delicous!! I had leftover tart shells prior to making this, so I only made the filling.  End result tasted like the store bought brand!!! Maybe better!  I found that if you're just going to make the filling, then to fill the tart shells almost to the top and then cover with pecans.  So if you have 6 tart shells, make enough filling for 12.  I also found I had to put these in the fridge afterwards so that the filling would solidify a bit more.  I don't know if others found this a problem and maybe I didn't leave it in the oven long enough.  But overall, takes two minutes to prepare!!  Very convenient dessert :)

I'm made three batches of these for Christmas this year, and they were the best. I added them to my neighbors and friends Christmas baskets and was asked for the recipe. I didn't change anything in the recipe. Will make again and not just for Christmas.

I followed the recipe to a "T" when making the crusts, but the dough was FAR too dry. I added a a tablespoon more margarine, but the end result was crumbly tart crusts- they were TOO crumbly. I loved the filling! I will search the site for another suggestion for the shells though.

I think that the directions could be improved, and the end result is really a 3 or 4 star recipe. Be sure to grind the pecans for the filling if you prefer the soft/even consitency like store bought tarts. I cooked the filling over medium heat, and let it boil for about 30 seconds before taking it off the burner.

Love the recipe!  Make sure you put the crust in the cups very thin or you lose the taste of the pecans.

I just made these and had a horrible time with the tart portion.  It was incredibly dry though I followed recipe exactly.  It was hard to form them into the muffin tin.  They aren't pretty enough to serve to guests though they taste wonderful.

It was a great recipe. There is a lot of leftover syrup. Perhaps I should deepen the pocket in the dough to accommodate more syrup. I used a wooden, rounded pestle that was perfect for shaping the dough up the sides of the pan.

I just wanted to say that my mom and I have been making these for years, but we use the pre-cooked mini phyllo cup found in the refrigerated section of our grocery store instead of the crust. It makes it super easy and fast!

I just used the shell.... I filled it with blueberry filling because thats what I had. It was good and everyone liked them, I just felt they had to much almond flavor. It over powered my oven while cooking. Still really good recipe just think I will use VANILLA instead of almond. Really just depends on what you like!

These are so yummy :o)  My mom and I just made 12 doz. this week.  I use this exact recipe.  A couple of tips to make this easier.  Use the silicone mini muffin pans.  These come right out and do not stick.  Also, we use a Pampered Chef tart shaper to make the dent in the center, works like a dream.  This is our most requested Christmas cookie.

Not sure if it was cook's error or the recipe, but the "crumbs" for the crust were very dry.  I added a bit of water but this was not like regular press pie crust mixture.   I am just using the crust for pumpkin filling.  We'll see how they turn out after pre-baking.

I borrowed a few tips from the Honey Crunch Pecan Pie recipe:  the glazed pecan topping(butter, brown sugar, honey)  which I topped the tarts with and baked for 5 min, and added a dash of bourbon to the filling.  Always a hit!

I am confused. Most of the reviews talk about 24 tarts yet near the picture it says yield is 4 dozen? Well, I made them and got 48 awesome tarts from the recipe just as written. Delicious!!

Ah yes, my grandmother used to make these for family reunions.  So delicious we even loved them as non-nut-loving children.  My sister wanted to claim 2 for her own once which she did by secretly licking them.  Turned out she had to give one up to our uncle, but we never told him......

These were ok. Not exactly what I was hoping for. The "dough" tasted ok, but needs some improvements. The filling came out super sweet and hard. I like the tiny tart recipe on here a lot better for pecan tarts.

The almond crust was really good, and it had lots of flavor (although I would add some salt). When I cooked the filling on the stove, I must have cooked it for too long because it immediately hardened. Next time, I also wouldn't have made the mistake of using light corn syrup.

I baked 12 dozen of these for a cookie exchange and they were excellent!  However, watch the time carefully when baking the shells.  The first 4 dozen (all in the oven at once) burnt in just 8 minutes!  I was using the dark-colored non-stick bakeware which probably caused the problem.  When properly baked, they are very tasty.

These are very tasty tarts. I used vanilla instead of almond extract. I imagine the almond extract would add slightly more flavor, but the vanilla allowed the flavor of the pecans to shine.  I loved that this recipe does NOT contain sour cream for those that have issues with lactose/dairy. The crust dough is rather crumbly, but with a little manipulation & a small splash of water I was able to press it into the mini-muffin tin. I filled the filling to the top of the crust and did not have issues with it boiling over or leaking.

Here's the reasons why I knocked off one star: The recipe does not state whether the margarine should be melted, cold, or soft. I melted the margarine in both the crust and filling, trying to add more moisture and it turned out well. The filling was way to much for 24 tarts! If I made it again I'd make 1/2-3/4 of the recipe for the filling. It's a waist of  pecans to have so much filling leftover, though it will likely depend on the size of your mini muffins (I do not believe this pan size is standardized). Also the recipe says to add the pecans twice (both chopped and halfed pecans), but the ingredient list only calls for chopped.

Note: these are not like mini pecan pies. The filling is has no egg or binder, it is just a sugar syrup with pecans. You won't have that bit of carmely gel under the pecans like you get with some other tarts. When you take these out of the oven and pry them out of the tin, that filling will be scalding hot and not set. As

I've made these before using this recipe and again they came out perfect . Just the right size bite . Read some reviews 
mentioning crumbly or dry crust I just added a few drops
of cold water not margarine just to hold it  together . Also I 
used butter in my crust its what I had on hand .

Is this really a recipe for a mini muffin tin?  I ended up having to scoop out a hole in the cooked tart dough to make room for some filling.  It made WAY too much filling, so I think it must actually call for regular-sized muffin tins.  Also, some information about how long to let the filling boil would help - my filling was very runny.

These are okay - I probably wounldn't make them again. They're time-consuming to make and not as great as I thought they might be.

These were so easy to make. I make them all the time for the kids to take to school parties.
And they taste just like pecan pies.
