It was a good recipe, but it was pointed out to me by a few people at my gathering that it did not taste like shrimp. The shells were hard to stuff too. I would make this recipe again, though. Good.

I made this recipe for my sisters baby shower.  The theme was "Think Pink" and most of the food was pink.  Not only did this dish look great on the food table, the guests enjoyed it.  I would definately use the recipe again.

I liked this, but I tweaked the recipe a ton because I thought it was bland. May be my fault; my first change was Greek yogurt in place of Miracle Whip. That probably made the filling less flavorful. I added hot sauce, a little bit of rum, bit of vinegar for the classic MW zest, and a few different spices. Then I liked it better! I will make these again, and may follow the recipe.

When I first made this, it was definitely a miss. The second time around, I tweaked it quite a bit. This is how I made it (the four stars are based on my version):

I replaced the tuna with imitation crab (shredded). I used 1/2 the amount of Miracle Whip and replaced the 2nd half with Campbell's Condensed Cream of Shrimp soup. I added garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, parsley, basil and capers along with the remaining ingredients. I used the jumbo shells and stuffed the mixture into the cooked shells. I topped it off with a slice of avocado. They are them like a finger sandwich (don't overcook the pasta or it will be oozing all over the place). I made them for a baby shower and barely got then out the door because my family wouldn't stop eating them! The party guests really enjoyed them and I got requests to make it for the next pot luck, at church, and future bridal/baby showers (as I tend to be the party planner/ caterer for our church, family and group of friends). I only got a nibble of one as someone took my plate, but it was yummy, creative and inventive. Thanks for the starter recipe!

No spices? Not one? Not even pepper or celery salt or something? A bit bland without. I used some mayo and some miracle whip because I was confused. This turned out well, was liked, was eaten. Shrimp? Not a chance. Expecting tuna? You'll do just fine. This recipe won't be the star of the party but I bet it will be mostly gone. Easy summer weekend dinner after a busy day. Don't put too many hopes and tears into this recipe;  it is quick, easy, and you won't be hungry. Not bad for leftovers.
