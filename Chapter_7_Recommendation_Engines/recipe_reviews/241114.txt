Used coconut oil, a little maple syrup, and a dash/pinch of cayenne. Perfect combination. A REAL treat you don't have to feel guilty about!!!

Addictive!!!! Not sure why some are having so much trouble. If you use a mandolin, slice them fairly thin and cook them long enough, they are PERFECT! So versatile too. I sliced up one medium sweet potato and that made 4 plates worth.  The first couple batches were just seasoned with salt. The third batch I added red curry powder and the last batch had cinnamon. All amazing, so much so that I didn't have time to take a pic!  In my microwave, 4:30 was a good time. When they're hot, they might be a tiny big soft, but once they cool, they crisp up nicely. Thanks for the great recipe! So much healthier than store bought fried chips!

I used coconut oil and added a touch too much of cayenne pepper but they never got crispy.  I went as long as ten minutes in the microwave or more but not crispy.  The book club ladies thought they were tasty but I was not pleased with the soggy result.

AMAZING! I have been deep frying and oven toasting all kinds of potatoes for years with limited success. I will never waste the energy or resources again.  I used an everyday dinner plate. Probably could put salt pepper or whatever on after cooking. A mandolin definitely helps keeps slices consistent in thickness. Put the thicker slices towards the middle because that's where it gets hot first.  After a couple minutes you may want to flip them because they tend to stick to the plate.  Keep an eye on them because too much time will make them black.  A single layer is best and this works with regular taters too, just may take less time. And if you need a lot, make them in batches. It only takes a few minutes each batch. If you oil them remember a little oil goes a long way.  I never cared for sweet tater chips, I made them for my wife. She loves them and I'm a big fan. Thanks for helping me get to the "root" of the problem ;  )

I love sweet potato chips and these turned out ok, but to cook an entire sweet potato it took forever because you can only put so many on a plate that fits in the microwave.  I will stick to cooking in the oven.

It took me 9 minutes to get these crispy, but they were pretty good, and better than in the oven. 13 year old girls liked them.

I tried the recipe using sweet potatoes (not yams).  I sliced them by hand quite thin.  They ended up burning and never really got brown.  I have to try this again using yams to see if that makes a difference.  I would not suggest sweet potatoes for this recipe.

A keeper for us.  I think how long they are cooked varies from microwave to microwave and the size of the individual slices.   I use a quick slice mandoline for even slices and microwave anywhere from 3 to 4 1/2 minutes on 90% power.  Sometimes have to add a few more seconds.  Haven't been able to get the slices crisp in the center, but they're close.  We've had them several times since I read the recipe.  They make a great snack!   Thanks so much.

I did everything according to the directions.   Although they tasted good,  I couldn't get them to crisp up.   I even microwaved longer and most were still soft.   I'll try again in
the oven next time.

All I can say is that my husband, who has an aversion to “healthy” snacks,  couldn’t get enough of this super simple treat! The only modifications I made were to increase the olive oil to 2 tbsp as I used a large sweet potato and I wanted to make sure the slices were adequately coated. Also, after cooking the first batch, I found that if I placed the slices on parchment paper that they came out crisper in 5 minutes or less, depending on how many pieces were on the plate. I will definitely be making this again!

These turned out pretty good!  I think that 4:30 is about the right time in my microwave.

Easy, delicious, addictive !! Amazingly simple and fast to make. Thinner slices do better in the microwave, but watch carefully. Nothing store bought is this good !

This did not work for me at all. The sweet potato chips were soggy.
