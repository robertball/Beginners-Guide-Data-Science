Crazy good vegan grub. I never would have thought to use pumpkin for tacos. It only needed a little help. I felt that the squash would compliment a touch of the Carribean so I chopped it small and added a can of rinsed black beans for protein, a one inch piece of ginger (minced), a dash of chipolte hot sauce, a pinch of allspice, and a squeeze of lime over it. I just stirred in the topping ingredients and served it with a pile of tortillas, yellow rice, and fruit salad.

Soooo good! although i mostly only borrowed the idea of a pumpkin taco - added garam masala, cinnamon and maple syrup to pumpkin while it simmered in apple juice, added indian spiced chicken with lots of cayenne and sauteed collards with black eyed peas, all rolled up in a soft taco topped with tomatoes and avocado - just like my favorite burrito at Mamacitas in Asheville, NC!

I cooked butternut squash instead of pumpkin, with the onion.  This recipe made a great tasting filling inside of homemade whole wheat tortilla shells!

I enjoyed this! Given the other reviews I spiced it up a little more with 1 tsp of coriander and ground red pepper, as well as a little cayenne and white pepper. I also used a vegetable bouillon cube dissolved in 1/2 cup hot water rather than stock and added some fake meat crumbles. In some fresh corn tortillas it was delicious, and all the garnishes gave it an interesting blend of vegetable tastes. It was just a little bit bland, I'll probably spice/salt it up more next time. I never would have thought to make something like this. Thanks!

Sorry, but I found the filling for the tacos to be pretty bland.  I used corn tortillas and they were all you could taste...plus they crumbled and resulted in a very messy meal!

I used a different winter squash in place of pumpkin, but I bet the taste is not far off. The onion and tomato taste fantastic with the squash flavor. Definitely a keeper.

I followed some suggestions and added black beans and lots more spice (cumin, Tabasco). I used our Halloween jack-o-lantern and mashed it together with the black beans, it was yummy! Much better than TVP that I normally use for taco night.

Made this for Taco Tuesday this fall and my family loved them absolutely.  Super tasty and light. We used corn tortillas but will make again with flour tortillas. Very good idea.

These were tasty, easy, and healthy. We wound up needing to sort of par-cook the pumpkin first to make peeling and cubing it easier, but after that it was done in a snap. Would have liked a little more flavor though, and I think next time I'll add some lime juice and maybe jalapenos.

I added black beans, a half tablespoon of chili powder and a quarter tablespoon of cayenne.  The hot pumpkin base is delicious with the cool avocado and tomato.
