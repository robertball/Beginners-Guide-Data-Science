These tasted amazing! A little labor intensive but not too bad. Only thing I didn't like was that the graham cracker crust got a little soggy after the pies had been sitting for a little while. My college friends love it when I bake because I always have left-overs and they loved these as well. Will definitely be making again in the future.

These are so good!  I doubled the recipe, and they were gone soon after I put them out!  I didn't make any changes except to use the Cream Cheese Tart Shells recipe from this site (prebaked for 10 minutes).  I made the filling and put it in the shells overnight.  The next day, I reheated the pies so that the filling was very hot and piped the meringue onto it.  I made a raspberry sauce garnish of raspberries mixed w/ a little sugar and blended until smooth (strained out the seeds with my flour sifter).

great recipe!  I only used one tablespoon of lemon zest and was a little skeptical about the crust staying firm after reading reviews, but it was still great two days after making the pies.   They were so fantastic they didn't last long!

Made these yesterday and they turned out wonderfully!  I doubled the recipe to make 12 mini pies and I omitted the almond extract and it worked perfectly, they were absolutely beautiful and delicious.  Will definitely make these again, thanks for sharing!!

To avoid a soggy crust, bake the crust until lightly browned, about 10 minutes, then add filling.  Great recipe.

I was asked to make dessert for a family supper and most loved it. My mother in law thought it was to tart but everyone else said it was fine. Instead of putting it in mini pie shells i did a 9" pie. I perfer lemon meringue in a pastry crust. I also added a few drops of yellow food coloring because my hubby likes his lemon pie yellow. Definitelya keeper at my house!

Turned out really well. Was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. While I was making the lemon filling I put my glass mixing bowl in the freezer. I've found that using a cold bowl for whipping egg whites makes it a lot easier. I also used powdered sugar rather than regular sugar so that it wouldn't come out grainy. I plan I making this again for sure.

I make these frequently, however.....in the interest of simplicity - I bake the shells (pastry) first, make a pkg. of Sherriff's Lemon Pie filling (easy!!); pour it in, top w/meringue and bake just long enough for the meringue to brown!  Always consistent and a favorite with hubby!

These little bites of awesomeness were super easy to make. I only had one brown egg, to I used two white eggs with the one brown. It make no difference at all.  They turned out perfect. Everyone loved them!

It was AWESOME. My sister and I made this together as a sister activity. They came out perfectly and in no time they were all gone. There was a lot of extra lemon stuff and extra meringue but it was fine because we ate them.

I could not find any mini graham cracker shells so I used a 9inch one, did brush the shell with egg whites and heated in oven for about 5 minutes. Followed the recipes and it had great flavor however my filling was a little runny after it cooled. I attempting to refrigerate hoping this will thicken up the filling.

I've made this twice now - first with lemons and then again with limes (the pic I uploaded was from when I made it with limes). Very simple, very quick, and very tasty! Sets up nicely too. I have found that the pies taste much better the morning after I bake them---the flavors start coming out more. This works really well with the "Cream Cheese Tart Shells" recipe on this site. If you try that combination, I recommend pre-baking those tart shells for about 5 minutes before filling them with your custard---otherwise the shell won't cook as fast as the filling and meringue, and your tarts will be a bit soggy.

The lemon filling tasted great and just right.  This recipe filled 11 of my 12 mini graham cracker crust shells, but that was enough for us anyway.  I also actually used 2 tbps of zest and a bit more juice because I like a higher tartness level.  I could have used another egg white and a little less sugar because I like a nice high merengue.  That said, the sugar content is what helps it brown so fast in the oven.  Overall, I'll make these babies again!  :-)

The lemon filling was DELICIOUS, but I couldn't get the meringue to work. We originally tripled the recipe and I was baking with kids, so I thought we made a measuring error. Made another batch for just one serving as shown and still no luck. Never got fluffy at all.
