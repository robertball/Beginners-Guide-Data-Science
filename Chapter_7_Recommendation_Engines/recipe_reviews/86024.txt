I am not the biggest fan of cream cheese, but I decided to try this anyway.  Overall I thought it was really good.  I'm a dressing-maker novice and it was simple to create...  I'm sure I'll make this again.

My hubby loves this stuff!  Sometimes I will add a bit of sour cream to it.  Great as is!

Great! Will half it next time, though -- a little too much for one dinner of chicken wings. :)

LOVE this dressing! I use a full 5 oz container of bleu cheese. I put the ingredients in a blender, with about half the bleu cheese, and blend. Then I fold in the rest of the bleu cheese so there's chunks. I love it this way! For those stating that this is bland, try a little more lemon juice and make sure to season with salt and pepper. I didn't add any salt & pepper the first time, and it was a bit bland without those essential seasonings.

YUM! I made it almost as is except the milk or salt & pepper. I wanted it thick since I was using it for wings. It is sooooo much better than a bottle. Will make this recipe whenever I need some Bleu Cheese dressing. I did add more Bleu Cheese though....about double. I like it chunky for wings & celery.

Delicious! If you find that the dressing is too thick add a little greek yogurt.

One more 'tip' regarding this recipe. Since true Roquefort is very hard to find, you can sub OREGON BLUE for this recipe. Rogue Creamery in Central Point, Oregon makes Oregon Blue from the original 'starter' blue from France.

We give this a 3 1/2 rating. It is a little bland. We only had about 2 oz. of cream cheese left so we only put in 2 T. of milk so it wouldn't be too runny. Next time I think I will add a little more lemon juice for zip and a little more garlic. I think that it needs to sit a bit too so that all of the ingredients will blend well together. Thank you for the recipe.

Not bad, loved the garlic, but just average and not quite what I was looking for. A little on the thick side too.

This was more like a dip than a dressing.  But is was very good with our Buffalo Wings.  I would highly recommend this recipe for that purpose, but would move on to something more creamy and a bit thinner for an actual salad dressing.  Great flavors however so do give it a try if you like your dressing on the chunkier side.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

Wonderful, made it just like the recipe called for the first time. Second time added
a drop of vinegar to the milk to make buttermilk. Added 1/2 tsp. sugar.  Wonderful flavor. Thank you.

I love this recipe. I have been trying to replicate Bob's Big Boy Roquefort Dressing for many years.  I have tried several different recipes but they were too thin for my personal preference.  This tastes like Bob's and has the thick and chunky texture.  I did use the entire 5 pz  wedge of Blue Cheese but other than that I made no changes.

I made this a blue cheese flavored cream cheese type product and used it to drizzle over a buffalo chicken salad.  For us it's mild flavor and intense creaminess were a perfect compliments to our extra spicy chicken.

I did not have cream cheese ok n hand but it still tasted great. I substituted heavy cream for the milk in hopes of getting the texture I might miss from the cream cheese. I did add more seasoning as others suggested and a tad more lemon juice. the hubby thought it was delightful atop the iceberg lettuce wedge with tomatoes and bacon crumbles

The best blue cheese dressing recipe I've made! Used real Roquefort, yogurt instead of sour cream. Simply delicious.

It finishes really thick, so I cut it with 1/2  1/2  when i serve it.  Very tasty.  I started using whipped cream cheese and that made it easier to mix.    Thinking about substituting goat cheese for the cream cheese.  It will lower the fat content.

A Dish of delish! Don't skip the garlic. I added a few drops of hot sauce and a pinch of cayenne pepper. This is even better the next day. Great on a wedge salad with slivers of red onion, 
thinly sliced radishes, and crumbled bacon. Also wonderful with wings. Thanks for posting the recipe!!

This dressing is delicious! It's definitely thick but we like it. I always just dump the whole 5 oz. container of bleu cheese in but even without all that the recipe is 5 stars.
