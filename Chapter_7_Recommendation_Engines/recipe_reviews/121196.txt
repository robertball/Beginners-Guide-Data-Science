These are not only delicious cookies, but they are also very appealing to the eye. They did not last long on my cookie tray over the holiday. I did not change a thing in this recipe and I will definitely make these again.

These were so good.  I tried jelly and even hot fudge filling.  I also added sprinkles to the dough for my princess.  They were a big hit.  thank you for sharing.

I give them a five star rating because for what ingredients you use and the time it makes to make them, they are good. They aren't the most delectable cookie ever, but they are tasty, they are easy, and they don't take many ingredients or effort. I made them yesterday and they are still soft today, which is good, I don't like hard cookies. One thing maybe I'll do next time I make them is that somehow I'll give the jam a larger surface area. I don't like how you only get jam when you eat the middle. Oh, and to put the jam in the middle, I used a frosting/icing decorating bag and squeezed it out into the hole so I wouldn't have a mess all over the cookie. That probably didn't make any sense. Maybe you know what I mean.

I was looking for a simple, cheap, and yummy recipe to make for a cookie exchange and this recipe was perfect!  I made a sample batch today to make sure knew how they would turn out and if they needed any tweaking.  They were great!  My 2-year-old especially loves them. I hope they freeze well!  I used a ziplock with the corner cut off to add the preserves, as another commenter suggested and I believe it really helps keep the cookie pretty.  Also, I allowed the cookie to cool a bit on the cookie sheet before removing to the wire rack, since my first batch had some cracked corners.  Allowing to cool on the sheet fixed that problem.  Also this recipe makes 2 dozen.  I was assuming it only made one dozen, but I guess 2 cookies is a serving size.

These were so good and my little ones enjoyed making them.  We used a measuring spoon to make the print so we can put more preserve.

Sweetheart Cookies' Haiku: "Rockin' butter taste. Fruity, buttery, yum! Looked beautiful too." These  cookies are a cinch to make, pretty in appearance, and mega-marvelous. I tinted my cookie dough pink-ish for V'day, used raspberry jam, and added a little pink icing for decoration. (Instead of powdered sugar.) I'm looking forward to making these again w/ a variety of different fillings.

I made this exactly as the recipe says and WE LOVED THESE COOKIES!  ... especially hot out of the oven... mmmmm!  They are like a shortbread with a little treat in the middle.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for our family!  Oh - and I got 2 1/2 dozen out of this batch.

I give this 5 for versatility.  Though it says no substitutions, I always have to sub when baking due to food allergies.  I used dairy free margarine, and EnerG egg replace for 1 egg.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla, and about 2T flour.  I skipped the kneading by hand and just added the flour with the mixer just until combined.  I ended up with 2 dozen fantastic cookies.  I made them for a playgroup and all the kids (and moms)  enjoyed them.  I will definitely make these again.

Pretty good and easy to make. It did take almost 10 min longer to bake than the recipe stated, but that could just be differences in ovens.

These didn't turn out the way i expected them to. They weren't horrible, but they weren't great either. The edges were nice and lightly brown so I pulled them out of the oven and they were still soft inside so I let them sit in the oven a little longer. There was something about the taste that was off. I think I'm going to try it one more time before I completely say 'yay' or 'nay' on this one.

These were pretty good.  The first time I made them was for a holiday party last year, but I didn't get a chance to rate them until now.  These were easy, kid-friendly, cheap, and yummy recipe.  I give it a 4.5 out of 5.

You may want to double these, they're that good (and easy).  Filled with damson plum, raspberry, apricot, and apple preserves.  They also add some color to your cookie platter.

Very simple and tastes amazing.  One would think this took a lot of effort to make, but they taste great and look just like out of a professional bake shop.

I had some trouble with the mix being extremely sticky so I added more flour than the recipe asked for, and still came out wonderful.

Like others have said, double the recipe because these will be gone quick.

I love how all these cookies fit on one sheet and they do not spread.   They are very good.  I think my mother in law makes a variation that is rolled is pecan meal and topped with a candied cherry or almond.

This is a great recipe- easy - I used the end of an ice cream scoop to make the well. It had a pretty flower-like design. I used lemon curd and it was very yummy.

It is a delight!I followed the exact direction with the same ingredients.  I tripled the recipe and my kids just loved it.  It reminds me of a Syrian cookies called Ghraybeh.  five stars for sure.  I should also say that I made some with jam and some with chocolate chips and the rest plain.

I had so much fun making these cookies.  I can see why they won blue ribbons.  I used different jams and lemon curd for the filling, I also left some without the fruit and filled with butter cream/cream cheese frosting.  I used vanilla, orange, and almond extracts (separate batches).  These are so versatile to shape, fill, color, and decorate.  Thank you, Pamela!!!!

These were pretty good - tasted best fresh from the oven or day of cooking and are not a cookie that will keep well for more than a day or two. Still these were happily demolished by my 3 year old.

I'm a beginner, and wanted something good to make for work for Thanksgiving. The recipe is easy to follow, and the ingredients aren't anything I'm not used to seeing or using. Once I got into the dough-making phase, it got to be a little tricky. I know what dough is supposed to look like, and I followed the directions to a T, but the dough cracked and was extremely flaky. I almost gave up, after having them in the oven for 15 minutes, pulling them out, and having them look almost like I'd never even baked them, but when I tried one, It was probably the best fruit-filled cookie I've ever tasted. I'm glad I followed through on this one. Next time, I think I'd make them bigger, but otherwise, they were superb.

These cookies are delicious! Love em!  I made them just as written, only difference is I didn't knead them on a board, just added a bit of flour and kneaded in the bowl, worked great and less mess.  I used raspberry jam, so good!

These cookies taste amazing, and they're also really pretty! I doubled the ingredients, expecting to get 24 cookies, but ended up with about 50! (Hey,  no complaints about that.) So unless you want to make these really, really big, expect to get about 25 cookies out of the amount of ingredients given here for 12 cookies. I also found them a bit too sweet for my liking, so next time I'll use less sugar. But still, these cookies are absolutely delicious!

I've made this recipe twice, once with raspberry preserves and once with apricot preserves. It was great both times! 

Note: The cookie can be a little dry, but it's still tasty. The second time I made these I had extra dough and experimented by rolling in blueberries - an incredibly delicious addition that I highly recommend. Enjoy! :)

I gave this recipe four stars because they taste so good, but mine turned out crumbly and didn't stay together well. I wondered if I had done something wrong and checked again to make sure I didn't use too much flour...but I had followed the recipe correctly. I won't be using this recipe for cookie exchanges, but the flavor is very good so I may use it again for eating at home.

Great cookies! Very easy to make! Not many ingredients needed! I actually quadrupled the recipe thinking each batch made a dozen, and I ended up with almost 11 dozen cookies, so one batch actually makes around 2 1/2 dozen. I will be adding this recipe to my collection!

My favorite/signature cookie recipe. These are delicious, simple to make and always please the crowd. Everyone asks for this recipe and no matter what the occasion the plate goes within minutes! I always give my Mother and Mother in law their own secret stash for after the company leaves! Ingredients are always on hand!

These are great! But they're buttery enough to NOT grease the pan. I, too, doubled the recipe and ended up with exactly 50 cookies rather than 24 . . . But I have 8 mouths to feed, so we each got six and there were two left over. I used blackberry seedless jam and strawberry seedless. I used a pastry dowel to make a perfect surface for the jam that's specifically made for this kind of cookie, and jam was in every bite. Yum! 2 Thumbs up!

These cookies are amazing! I forgot I had these in my recipe box, so this year I made another recipe for the same kind of cookies with more ratings, and it was no where near as good as these cookies are. Give this recipe a try, you will not be disappointed!

just made the cookies, my husband and his son LOVED them! My stepson said the dough is insane!  the recipe is very easy to follow and i did read some reviews and decided to follow example about the melted peanut butter to top the cookies off! and also added chocolate morsels to the dough. I love love love these cookies! they just melt in your mouth!

Made these for the Xmas cookie plate. They are a delicious addition to off set all the chocolate goodies. They are buttery and very tasty. Used the seedless raspberry jam for the filling. Made a larger space for jam, using the other end of a honey server I had on hand. adding close to 1/2 a tsp for each cookie. Everyone loved them!

I absolutely love these! So good! However, they break apart really easily.

Great cookie from scratch, I gasped when I saw the sugar and butter amount, so I actually put prob. 1/3 of a cup of sugar, and half a cup of butter (basically one and 1/3 sticks of butter. I used organic butter which was healthier and divine! It was still super sugary (I used a tsp of vanilla and 1 organic egg). So next time I may even prefer a bit less sugar (less butter may be risking it's crumble factor.) I used fig jam, peanut butter and jelly, and cinnamon apple jam, making three types. The fig was by far the best, with the peanit butter being #2, esp. for kids. I also made the smaller size (1 inch) and a larger one, making the indention alot bigger and putting more jam. You should try making some bigger cookies too, with a larger surface area of jam which might be divine.

The first time I made these, I didn't think they would be so good.... another cookie recipe.... these have become my signature cookie to ake for friends, family... I get so many requests for these. I even altered the recipe slightly by adding 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder in place of a half cup of flour to make these a chocolate cookie, which goes really good with a rich homemade strawberry jam. I'm writing this review now, cause well.... i'm again being asked to make these.... i hope 22 dozen will be enough this time. :) Bon Appetit.
