This dish was okay, but nothing spectacular.  It was easy to make, but a little bland.  I used chili with tabasco sauce added, but it still needed a little bit of spice.  I think an hour would have burned this dish in my oven.  After about 35 minutes this dish was golden brown and bubbling.  I'm going to try it again and add some cayenne pepper and garlic or something.  Maybe some more vegetables to add a little crunch.

Sorry, but we did not care for this.  My 9 year old son said it had a funny taste and would not finish his.  My husband and I thought it tasted like canned chili (we used Wolf Brand).  I don't know why this was rated so high.

Would love to give it more stars. Very easy to prepare and the taste is great. I would add just a little pepper but that's about it. Really liked it. Served it with the mayonaise biscuits from this site for a fantastic meal. Thanks. Myrna

My dh enjoyed this casserole but I personally didn't like it.  Too many different ingredients that in my opinion didn't taste well together.

Liked this one a lot for a quick and easy creamy cheesy casserole dish with a touch of spice. I didn't add the pimentos but would next time for some additional "punch".  The olives were a nice touch for texture. Be careful to undercook the noodles a bit - with an hour cook time mine were on the soggy side. Also, 1 lb of cheese was overkill in my opinion so I halved that amount and found it about right and still plenty cheesy.

Make at least 8 servings so there aren't any half-cans left over. The leftovers are tasty in school lunches or for something quick. You'll eat them! I will try adding some black beans or chili beans, too, next time. Tasty!

I took this to my family reunion last year. No one seemed to like it. Usually I come home empty handed. This time, I brought almost the whole pan back. Sorry, but I don't think I will make this again.

My husband love this dish alright.  He added a few drops of tabasco in his. I did some modification becuase I didn't have the right amount of ingerdient in hand.  I didn't have onion so I use onion power,I added garlic power I also don't have evaporated milk and used regular milk. I omitted olive because I don't like them and mushroom because I used mushroom a few time for the past week. I also didn't have 1lbs of cheese so I use what ever I have left and wasn't able to put cheese on top of my cassarole.  I used some of my leftover salsa.  This dish just tasted like chili cheese with pasta.  I was at first skeptical about the combination of chili and cream of mushroom,  It didn't sound right together.  Suprisingly it came out great.  Thank you Angelyn

After reading the comments I tried a modified version as well. This is a very good recipe for a church supper or for a crowd, BUT it needs spices and herbs…I cut out the evaporated milk, ( for lactose intolerance) and instead of the chilli I used 3 cups of  salsa ( the bottled kind). I did not drain the beef but added some Italian herbs and spices…you need to taste the sauce before you bake the dish….and adjust it to taste… oh yes; do not drain the fat.... just use ground round instead.... the fat stores a lot of the flavors

 It was great!

It was great! Everyone loved it.  Even the picky ones.  I agree with some of the other reviews that it is missing something.  I think that something is when you are about to serve the dish put a dollup of sour cream on top.  Maybe some salsa too.

Quick, easy, good, but needed something.  I exchanged the black olives for 4oz can chopped chilies and replaced pimentos with roasted red peppers. Gave it a little zip and little more color with red and green. Try it out on company and it worked with more requests.

Great hit (none left) at recent potluck supper with requests to make it again.  Even fussy hubby loved it! A definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing.
