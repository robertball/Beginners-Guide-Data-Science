This is a fabulous recipe, excellent tasting crispy chicken and doesn't take a rocket scientist to cook.  I do have some additions,like others, adding 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp onion powder. I also mix it all together with the flour in a plastic ziploc bag then pour it into a glass pie pan to dredge. If you want Popeyes style chicken, add 1/2 to 1 tsp of cayenne pepper to your flour mixture. I also always use a hint given to me by a wonderful elderly black southern lady; 20 minutes before cooking your chicken, place in a bath of ice water and pour a liberal amount of salt in and let it sit.  This helps with those icky blood vessels than can appear in or near the bone. Finally, I never ever "quick cook" chicken.  I have fried chicken for years, giving it up for health reasons, but have found 45 minutes of cooking time are needed especially for dark meat pieces and I repeatedly turn my chicken every 10 minutes or so to evenly cook, cooking the last 10 minutes at around 325 degrees (I use an electric skillet) to keep from burning the crust.

From a southern girl, let me tell you this is the real thing! As someone else points out, soaking the chicken in ice water with salt is very important.  Also, for those of you who had the flour fall off the chicken while cooking, that comes from not allowing the oil to heat properly.

This is half of the recipe.  I would add two stirred raw eggs in a bowl.  Rinse chicken, season with pepper, lawrys season salt, garlic powder a sprinkle, dip in flour, dip in raw egg, then dip back into flour, put chicken in skillet now, flip 6 times 10 minutes on each side.  Now thats some REAL southern FRIED chicken!  Thats what I call SOUL FOOD!

Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! The chicken came out crisp and golden, while remaining wonderfully moist! The smells alone drew my teenage brothers away from the video games! (A magical feat as far as I'm concerned.) I too was always intimdated by frying chicken. My oil was always too hot and my batter never stuck. I always rinsed the chicken in water then just rolled it in flour. This time I took another reviewer's suggestion and did an egg wash. Amazing! Overall everything was to die for and I will DEFINATELY be using this recipe again! I used boneless skinless breast instead of boned chicken and took the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tsp. of garlic powder and 1 tsp. of onion powder. Thumbs WAY up on this one! Thanks to the poster and helpful reviewers!

I made this last week for the entire family.  My dad ate 3 pieces and said he hadn't had chicken that good since he was a kid.  I used an electric frying pan so I could control the temperature  and so I would have a lid to cover with.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and soaked the chicken in salted/ice water for 20 min so there would be no veins.  It worked and we thought it may have helped to improve the flavor of the meat.

This recipe is fantastic! I was afraid of frying chicken in oil because I'd never done it. But I needn't have been afraid. I had no trouble with the coating coming off during frying. I followed the recipe as far as temperature, also soaked the chicken in cold salt water as one reviewer suggested and cooked it for 45 minutes as another ssuggeted. I used half Crisco and half vegetable oil. Turned out great and everyone loved it! Thanks!

great fried chicken! I have always been intimidated by frying chicken.  I usually marinate it overnight in buttermilk, use a purchased coating, and deep fry it.  It turns out burnt and you can't taste the coating.  I really wanted to make a good fried chicken so I came to Allrecipes once again.  This recipe seemed almost too simple and plain.  I did add garlic and onion powder like the others.  I didn't even use an egg wash, just double-coated the chicken pieces.  I probably cooked the pieces 40 minutes or so.  The coating was crispy, and you could actually taste it!!!  My family loved it, too.  I am just thrilled that I made GOOD fried chicken!!!  thank you!

Excellent recipe! I tried this with boneless/skinless chicken breasts and it came out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Made it for two, so I cut the recipe in half and added a tbsp of garlic powder (we really love garlic). Highly recommend this recipe :)

I always have a hard time making fried chicken...something always seems to go wrong.  NOT THIS TIME.  I loved the way that this turned out and the hubby loved this.  He went back for seconds within minutes.  The only thing that I did differently was to add just a little bit of garlic powder to the flour mixture.  No more KFC when we want good fried chicken....Thank you for the post.

Unbelievably good.  I also soaked the pieces in salted ice water, my grandmother told me that trick long ago.  I soaked thighs and drumsticks only for about an hour.  The key to getting the flour to stick is to let the chicken sit for a little while before you fry it.  And also, double dip the pieces.  Shake them once in a large plastic bag, and let them sit for about a half hour.  The flour coating will look like it's almost being absorbed by the chicken skin.  Then right before you put the chicken pieces into the hot oil, dip or shake them again.  VERY crispy and delicious.  Husband didn't even stop eating to comment, he just tackled the drumsticks then moved on to the thighs.  I cooked six pieces and managed to snag one thigh.  I think that is a resounding endorsement.

My first time cooking chicken that did not burn or cook unevenly - I used the suggestion of soaking the chicken in ice water and salt for 20 minutes. I also added garlic salt and onion powder as seasonings. I was skeptical about covering the pan at first but it actually makes the chicken very tender and juicy as well giving the chicken a gorgeous crispy brown coating. I made this Saturday night and again on Sunday night and it was a big hit! Highly recommended even for novice cooks!

After years of trying countless methods of frying chicken, with this simple recipe, I am finally a success.  I had spent a small fortune on food for the holidays and needed to do something economical to just have available over the New Year weekend.  I purchased leg quarters @ $.89/lb.  I cut them at the leg joint and proceeded as directed.  Really good.  My son, who hates cold chicken, enjoyed it so much hot off the stove that he had to give it a try cold and was very happy he did .  I did add a little garlic powder, sweet paprika and seasoning salt to the flour, let it sit for between 15 and 20 minutes before the second dredge in flour and then let it sit for about 10 minutes before frying.  None of that is what really made the big difference. This is a great recipe.  I'm a northerner who no longer wonders what it is that's so great about southern cooking.  Thank you Cindy!

I have tried making Fried chicken so many times in the past only to have the coating fall off, no flavor, just did not like.  With this recipe I do recommend brining the  chicken for at least 3 hours in milk, light cream and kosher salt sealed tightly in the fridge.  It cooked perfectly and was so juicy, can say that my daughter and husband said it tasted better than KFC Chicken. Not greasy at all, tender and the flavor were incredible.  I now make this at least 2-4 times a month and my family thanks me for it each time.

I made this tonight using all chicken legs (6 of them).  I took the advice of a couple other readers and I brined the chicken for 45 minutes in iced water and salt.  I then combined the flour in a gallong Ziploc with seasoned salt, black pepper, garlic powder (1 tsp) and onion powder (1 tsp).  I took another person's advice and I dipped the legs into the Ziploc mixture first, then I dipped the legs into a mixture of whisked egg white and 1/4 c. water, and then I dipped the legs again in the Ziploc mixture.  This chicken came out absolutely beautiful and all the coating stuck to the legs!  It was golden brown and it was the crispiest chicken I have ever eaten.  It sounded like we were eating a bunch of tortilla chips!  This recipe is fantastick and I would highly recommend it!

Excellent Recipe! Born and raised in the south, you'd think I'd know fried chicken, but I never mastered it until now! thank you!!! The first time I tried this the coating was beautiful but for some reason it was too soggy and not crispy...tonight I tried again...making sure my oil (1/2 Crisco-1/2 Oil) was good and hot and not covering the chicken!!! It was perfect! My husband was asking for more!!!  Other tips...the salt bath soak does wonders for removing the blood beforehand...I also use a combination of adobo/soul seasoning/garlic powder/black pepper, and it came out tasting so similar to KFC I was shocked!  Beautiful!!!! A+++

Excellent recipe! Instead of just salt and pepper I added Creole seasoning and extra paparika. The other reviews on here were also very helpful! Especially the one about putting the chicken in ice water and salt to get rid of the veins, it really worked, wow! That is a hint I will use for the rest of my life!  I also followed other reviewers and let the chicken sit for a few minutes after dredging it in flour and then put it in the flour again right before frying. If you like a thick fried breading, this is the way to do it!  Also, to make sure my oil was at 365, because I have a gas stove and no thermometer, I heated up my pan of oil in the oven at 365 and then put it on the stove with a medium flame. I didn't have any flour coming off the chicken as it went into the oil. I waited about 8 minutes before turning the chicken, and then after another 8 minutes I turned it again, so I did turn the chicken a couple of times, but it came out fine. I was just worried about burning it, but it came out GREAT!

Outstanding results. The only change I made was to sprinkle paprika over the floured chicken as my grandmother taught me that paprika is essential to browning meats. I also floured the chicken, laid the pieces on paper towel for about 10 minutes then floured a second time. I do that with all meats as it seems to help keep the flour on the meat.

If you really want the flour to stick first roll the chicken in flour, then dip in a mixture of whisked egg white with 1/4 cup of water, then roll in flour mix again. I like a little season all salt in the flour. you can really make this recipe your own by adding your favorite spices kinda plain w/out

Absolutely fantastic fried chicken! I also added garlic powder to my flour base. Heating the oil to the right temp extremely important. NONE of the flour mixture came off after doing this. LOVE

Great recipe. For you guys who like the white meat try soaking it over night in sweet milk. Makes it very juicy.

In order to keep the flour coating on the chicken, I just beat a couple of egg whites and roll the chix pieces in there before rolling in the flour mixture.  The chix came out great. I did add a touch of garlic also, as well as some sea salt and a touch of basil to the flour mixture.

Frying always seemed a labor-intensive process to get unreliable results. That said: This was some easy and tasty chicken. To get flour to stick, I dip the rinsed, dried pieces in a whisked mixture of 1 cup milk and 2 eggs; toss it in a bag of the flour coating and tap off the excess flour; pop it straight into the hot grease and cover the pot quickly. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this last night and it was delicious! As others reviewers suggested, I soaked in ice water with salt for about 15 minutes while I prepared everything else. I also added a few suggested spices. I mixed all of my spices together and rolled the chicken in that before dredging the flour. I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and cayenne pepper (we like it spicy!). Once dredged in flour, I let it rest on a wire rack for about 10 minutes so the flour and spices wouldn't just fry off and stick to the pan. I fried in an electric skillet at 360 and turned it very often (about every 5 minutes). I used only drumsticks because that's what we like. I cooked it 30 minutes and it was spicy, crispy and cooked to perfection. I will definitely be using this recipe from now on. Thank you!

This is what makes me such a fan of good old southern cooking! This recipe is excellent as is, and you can add to it as well - It's a very flexible recipe. Depending on who I am cooking for, I might add garlic salt, cajun seasoning, cayenne pepper, and onion salt. No matter what you add though, the chicken comes out nice and crispy on the outside, and juicy and tender on the inside. It took awhile for me to learn, but if you let the oil heat up to the specified tempurature, the coating won't fall off. Another alternative is to use a deep frier. The oil tempurature is most important. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

The only things I do differently is dip the pieces of chicken in a mixture of egg whites & a little milk before I flour them but I repeat that step twice so that they get double breaded and the crispy coating stays on so superbly!

This is the basic way to cook southern fried chicken.  Self-rising flour can also be used and you don't need the paprika to have good fried chicken. Back in the day, Crisco shortening was used for delicious fried chicken.

I haven't even tried this as I am from the South and grew up eating fried chicken with rice and gravy on the side. I just thought it was funny that it was even posted. Tips for those of you who truly can't make fried chicken. You can use whatever portion of the chicken you desire. Also, I season my meat directly with seasoning salt, black pepper and sometimes add garlic salt. Depends on how I feel. Then add the flour last. Also, as someone stated about cooking it on high. Don't. You will end up with burned chicken on the outside and not done internally. Hint: Chicken will float to the top when done. You will notice this when using a deep fryer. Even in a regular skillet. Not so much a chicken breast though. This recipe just seems very bland and I wouldn't bother trying it without of course making some changes.

This was my first time ever making fried chicken (no kidding! A 39 year old married 13 years!) and it turned out terrific.  Simple ingredients made for gentle flavors that shined through.  Paired with a simple salad of butter lettuce and grape tomatoes and smashed Yukon gold potatoes sprinkled with sea salt and butter and viola! a fabulously homey indulgence...

Trick to keeping skin is to properly heat the skillet before you put chicken in.  I would say at least 10 min. on the stove.  And then you must sear the chicken for 5-10 minutes.  I then cover and simmer for 25 min. (turning once).

This was really good. Fried Chicken was something I could never seem to get right, however it worked like a charm! I used bone-in chicken breast and put the flour into a plastic bag, then added the chicken and shook it all around. I also added season salt to the flour. My hubby loved it! thanks Cindy!

Delicious!! Exactly what I was hoping for! I used chicken legs for my kids and shortened the cook time to 5 minutes to brown first, then turn, then cooked covered for 15 minutes.I did add some dried mustard with the salt and pepper and it was great! The kids ate them all!! Will cook again!

AWESOME Chicken - thanks Cindy!!!  We absolutely loved this.  I took the advice of other readers and added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder and 1 tsp ground red pepper (cayenne), and it made an AWESOME addition.  Also, I did soak the chicken in ice cold water for 20 minutes and it worked!... there were NO veins near the bone.  Thanks for the advice - we will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe, and this is one you can and should alter to fit your tastes! I made changes, but the overall this is a no fail recipe! I added garlic powder, paprika and a little cayenne. I soaked my chicken over night in buttermilk, and also added the spices to the flour. I took them from the buttermilk to the flour, to the buttermilk and flour again. I let it soak in (in the fridge) while I heatd the oil, this helps the coating stick. The best fried chicken ever.

This is a great basic recipe.  I found marinating the chicken overnight gives it much more flavour. In my blender I mix fresh garlic, green onions, fresh thyme, salt and pepper, coat the "skinned" chicken and let it sit for at least 5 hours.  The other trick I use for keeping the flour on is to add some bacon fat to the oil.

Great simple fried chicken recipe. I would add one major tip for keeping the flour on the chicken during frying. In a medium sized bowl, mix one beaten egg and a half a cup of milk. Dip the chicken pieces in this mixture before rolling or shaking them in flour. Let floured chicken sit for about 5 minutes before frying.

Recipe turned out great, even my fussy kids liked it; my daughter said it was like KFC!  I put chicken in iced water for 20 minutes as suggested by others.  Also just mixed flour, salt, pepper and paprika together.  A hit for sure.

Very flavorful.  Turned out really well.
I always soak my chicken overnight for added tenderness.  I combined all dry ingredients, including flour with seasonings.  Very tender and moist.

Very good. My family has used this recipe for years. The only thing that they have done differently is bathe/marinate(?) the chicken in buttermilk first and then add some garlic powder and onion powder to the flour mixture. Fried chicken, potato salad and chocolate pie sure bring back memories from a many Sunday dinner at my Grandmother's. She always fried hers in a cast iron skillet....mmmm...

Great chicken. Made it using the basic recipe. Just soaked the chicken breasts in salted ice water, used my iron skillet on med heat and presto...wonderful dish.

Very easy recipe to follow. My dad went to costco and bought a HUGE package of chicken legs that needed to be used up.  The whole family wanted fried chicken - which of course I had no idea how to cook.  I used this recipe as a guideline, but took tips from other people who reviewed the recipe before me and soaked the legs in salty ice water for a half hour before cooking. This really helps "hide" the veins that pop out as you get close to the bone.  But the secret I learned (on my last batch, of course) was not to cook the chicken on high heat. The outside will burn and the inside will remain a little bloody. Cooking it on medium heat will give you crispy, and completely cooked chicken. Over all it was yummy. Will definatley do it again!

Wow! Great Southern Fried Chicken! I soaked Koser Chicken pieces in Buttermilk for an hour, dreged it in the seasoned flour, dipped it in beaten eggs and again in flour. fried it in a cast iron skillet (my favorite kitchen toy!) and removed it to the oven while I fixed mash potatoes and green beans. This is the best fried chicken ever! Myhusband looked at it while I was cooking and said,"That looks crispy!" Had no problem with the coating falling off. Just don't crowd the pan and make sure your oil i hot when you start frying. No grease either, Amazing!

Amazing!  My South Carolina mama would be proud!  "Bleed" the chicken first as directed with icy salt water first.  Dont forget to pat it dry, then flour, egg wash and flour again.  The other thing my mama taught me which I don't think was mentioned:  NEVER turn chicken more than once.

Great!  I tried frying as well as baking.  Both came out very good, but I think I prefer the Baked one.  30 min at 375 degrees, turning a few times to get both sides nice and crispy. transferred the chicken onto clean foil so it wouldn't soggy on one side sitting in grease and continued baking. Added 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper; 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper (ground up a little more in my magic bullet); 1 teaspoon of garlic powder; 1 teaspoon of onion powder; about 10 saltines crushed.  shook everything up in a large zip loc. Also, I Very LIGHTly coated the chicken with egg yolk before putting in a zip loc... I might try adding potato flakes next time.

This recipe is awesome. I have never made fried chicken before...I was so worried it would come out raw...not a risk I wanted to take. This recipe is easy to make and it tastes great. I did add a few things to mine based on suggestions....1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 1/2 tsp corn starch(these help it to be extra crispy), I also measured my salt and pepper which ended up being 1 tsp each. As each batch finished cooking I placed it in the oven on a paper towel lined cookie sheet at 350 degrees to keep it warm until time to serve. Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely delicious!I just finished supper  and had rave reviews from my family.This was my first time making fried chicken and it came out beautiful.I never knew how easy it was!I did like some other reviewers said and dipped it in the flour mixture and then dipped it in beaten egg with a little milk,and then back in the flour mixture.(I also added garlic powder,onion salt and savory to the flour mixture.)It came out perfect.I cooked it longer though on medium until it was golden brown and floating in the oil.Chicken will always float when cooked.Thank you for the recipe.I will definitely make again!

My first successful fried chicken, thankyou for the recipe and all of the additional tips from other reviewers.  But I have a (probably dum) question.  I am quite frugal and hate throwing away all of that vegetable oil.  Can it be strained then saved for another fry or do I just throw it away?

De-lish!!!  This was my first time fixing fried chicken.  I'm happy to say turned out great.  As other users suggested I did a whole egg wash first and spiced up the batter quite a bit more than the recipe called for.  I added Lawry's seasoned salt, garlic and onion powder and freshly ground pepper. I also added a little pre-seasoned corn meal for an extra crunch.  Thanks for a great dinner!

This is the best homestyle fried chicken I have ever tasted!  The key to prevent the flour from falling off the chicken is to make sure the oil is really nice and hot before you place the chicken in it.  So crunchy and tasty...it was great.  Thank you!

I have experimented with this southern fried chicken recipe many times before, however i have found that using 2 cups of all purpose four, divided is best. With one cup, mix the seasonings, and leave the other cup alone. In a seperate bowl mix an 8oz can of evaporated milk with 1tsp of salt, and 2 tablespoons of tobasco sauce. First roll the chicken in the plain flour, then the cream mixture, then in the spiced flour before frying in oil until brown and crispy. It has now became a family favorite.

Next time I will use less oil and just brown it without a lid then add a little water and cover it to finish it.  This is the way my Mom makes it and it stays so moist and yummy!

Yum.  I too used a deep frier, and added garlic & onion powders.  I floured it, got distracted for about 15 min, then floured it again because the flour sorta soaked into the chicken, and I had no problem with it not sticking....which is usually my problem as well.  Very crispy, not only on the legs, but on the 2 boneless skinless breasts as well.  Thanks Cindy!

Good fried chicken! I took advice of others and added some onion powder and garlic powder and the taste was great! Not sure what I did wrong but the coating didn't stay on through frying as well as I would have liked, but the taste of the delicious seasoning permeated the chicken anyway. Everybody enjoyed. Thanks for recipe!

Absolutely the BEST that I have ever made! One of the key steps in the flouring, is to do it twice; once before you fry, and then after letting the CRISCO come to temperature, (about ten minutes or so), flour it a SECOND time just before you put it in the frying pan. The time per side ( fifteen minutes) was PERFECT! It came out crisp on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. Thank you for sharing this.

Not much flavor in the basic recipe, but with garlic powder, onion powder, more paprika, a pinch of this, a dash of that...  It took 3 tries, but by the 4th chicken leg, it was perfect!

cookingood wanted to know how to keep the flour on the chicken.  My sister-in-law told me a long time ago when BBQ'ing, or frying chicken that your should always boil the chicken for about six minutes in a pot of water.  Then let the chicken drain and coat it with salt, pepper, paprika, and other seasonings of choice.  Once the seasonings are sprinkled all over the chicken, dip the chicken in seasoned flour.  Add about a half inch or inch of shortening to the frying pan, heating the oil until it is good and hot.  Add the chicken to the oil and fry it for about 20-25 minutes, turning the chicken every two minutes until the chicken is crisp on the outside.  Remove the chicken and let it drain and cool on paper towel.  When BBQ'ing, boil the chicken, drain, and cook it on the BBQ grill for 15-20 minutes, adding BBQ sauce during the last five minutes.  Chicken will always come out perfect and disappear quicker than you can blink your eyes.  Good eating.

Great fried chicken! I did the salt and ice water thing, patted dry, added a bit more seasoning to the flour, sprinkled salt, cracked pepper, and paprika on chicken before dredging in flour, let it sit on wax paper 10 minutes, then re-floured just before frying. CAST IRON SKILLET! No egg wash necessary, and recipe does NOT call for it. Do cover the skillet, and oil MUST be hot enough. Used medium high flame. Fried 10 minutes on each side, turning only once, so 20 minutes total. Juicy, flavorful, not greasy -- just like my momma used to make!

fabulous.  after the first 2 times, i started seasoning the raw chicken w/garlic powder and S&P b4 dredging in the seasoned flour.  i also now put cheyenne pepper in the flour because my mam likes it SPICY. and that's how he likes his fried chicken too.

I brined the chicken like other reviewers suggested and it turned out pretty tasty. The only thing is, it turned out a little dry, not sure why.

I've been trying to authenticate that "good ol' Southern taste" in my fried chicken and his recipe is the best! My kids raved about it, even though I used too much salt on the first try. I use drumsticks instead of breasts.

I grew up with this recipe as a kid.  The only thing i would suggest is to dip the chicken in a milk/egg batter before the flour mixture.  This helps the batter stick and gives you a thicker coating.  Can't go wrong with this one!

This is a classic method for frying chicken. I brined my chicken in iced saltwater for about an hour before using. I added a teaspoonful of an italian herb mixture (containing marjoram, thyme, rosemary, savory, sage, oregano and basil)and about a  teaspoonful of onion and garlic powders to the flour with the salt and pepper. I omitted the paprika and added a pinch of seasoning salt and cayenne instead. I shook my chicken in the flour mixture in a heavy paper bag and fried it in an electric frying pan with a lid and used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 corn oil. I cooked the dark meat first then cooked the breasts in a second batch alone. My family loved this! The smell in my house was to die for.  With the herbs I added there was a KFC kind of taste to it without the chicken being overcome with breading. Best chicken I have made in a very long time! I can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

Great fried chicken!!! As far as keeping the flour coating on the chicken I always use an egg wash to keep batters on.

I have made a very similar recipe from my Texas Dad for many, many years. My only little update is that I add ground thyme and sage to the flour.
I also make the cream gravy but use evporated skim milk to keep it little healthier!

It took some experimentation with trying to keep the batter on the chicken.  I used tongs and it tore the batter off a bit.  I switched to a fork and didn't poke it too deep, and it worked much better.  The flavor of the batter is great.  I'm going to make this again.

This is the first time I fried chicken! It was amazing! I used some chicken tenderloins I had purchased, so the cooking time  was only about 7 minutes. I also used coconut oil to fry them in. It was perfect! Great recipe!

Great recipe. Never been able to make good fried chicken, the batter always fell off!  But using this recipe and others suggestions, the chicken was beautiful!!  Following others suggestions: did an ice water bath with salt, then added a few extra seasonings to the flour mixture.  Gave chicken (I used drumsticks) a good few shakes in flour mixture using ziplock bag.  Let sit for about 20 mintutes.  Dipped chicken in 2 eggs whites & 1/4 cup water, then put back into ziplock for a few more shakes.  Let that sit for 15-20 minutes.  Heated oil while waiting on chicken during that 15-20 minutes, that way I knew oil would be hot enough.  Cooked legs about 15 minutes.  They were perfect!   Will definately make again.  Everyone loved them!

After the 1st batch flopped because the flour fell right off, we tried mixing the seasonings into an egg. This kept the flour on but there was less seasoning on the chicken. No flavor to it, even with the 1st batch. Big flop of a recipe! No idea how generations could pass down this recipe. It's not worth it in my book.

I just finished making this & cleaning up the greasy mess it made on my stove.  It was crispy and looked nice but it did not have any flavor.  I did the ice water bath for about 45 mins, floured the chicken, put it in the fridge and dipped in flour again right before I put the chicken in the pan.  I don't think it was worth all the work.  Might be better if you put some spices in the flour.  I like my over fried chicken recipe better, tastes better and no greasy mess to clean on my stove.  Won't be making this one again.

Excellent deep fried chicken. By using vegetable oil there is very little to no oil absorbed. I did marinate the chicken in buttermilk w/Old Bay Seasoning and a bit of garlic seasoning for about an hour (because I like it marinated), then dipped in seasoned flour mixture, let the chicken 'rest' on a rack for ab. 10 min. then fried. Yum. This recipe is in my favorites and have used it several times. Also, because it does not absorb the oil it is great cold for lunch/dinner the day:)

Just about everything was great! The chicken was crisp, moist, had no problems sticking to the pan, the coating stuck to the chicken and it looked absolutely mouthwatering. My only problem was that the spices were too bland, so the next time I make this I'll definitely have to up the amount. As usual, I did NOT use vegetable oil but coconut oil, this time halved with palm shortening.

Recipe was definitely plain. Made three pieces of chicken by this recipe, with a bit of added white pepper. I deep-fired three legs at 365 degrees for 17 minutes, turning once, and had slightly burnt skin so I'd cook it just a little less. Very crispy the second time (360 degrees for 15 minutes), a lot different than I expected, but delicious.  However, I am excited to try this tomorrow with more White Pepper, Paprika, Salt, Garlic Powder, and a little Creole seasoning that adds wonderful flavor in a small amount, and the kick doesn't overwhelm the chicken. Not a bad recipe, but it needs improvement.

Sooo good!! I added about 1 Tblsp of Cajun seasoning, pinch of cayenne pepper and extra salt. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast & cut up into bite-sized pieces. I wanted to make my own chicken nuggets :) They were absolutely delicious and we dipped them into some hot pepper glaze sauce. Never trust a skinny chef!

To keep the flour on the chicken, season the pieces, dip them in some whipped egg, then roll in flour. Or toss pieces in a Ziploc that has flour in it.

OUTSTANDING.  We've tried many fried chicken coatings and this is one of the best. Chicken got really golden brown and crispy.  I did soak chicken in ice salt water before hand for 30 minutes and used Olive oil to pan fry.  Also added more cayenne pepper to mix. THANKS

Delicious. My mother made this recipe for years and I, along with my sisters continued the tradition. Now, my daughter-in-law uses the same recipe.  The only difference is that we dip the chicken in eggs and milk first and then add garlic powder and onion salt to the flour.  We prepare it and refrigerate on wax pappered pan for about one hour before frying.  I also use canola oil instead of vegetable oil.  Much healthier.  Thanks for sharing.

I did enjoy this recipe VERY much and my family LOVES it, I did have to twist is a little with some garlic powder and seasoned salt because the first batch was sort of flavorless. But for the most part I stuck to your recipe and it turned out FABULOUS! Great job!!!!!!

I followed the basic recipe but with a few changes. I used chicken tenders because it was all I had. After coating with the flour/spice mix I dregged chicken in an egg/milk mix then recoated with a seasoned breadcrumbs/flour mix. Then I set in the fridge for about 10 mins. I don't have a deep fryer so I used the stovetop method and cooked pieces for 5 mins on both sides. Chicken came out crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Served with bbq sauce and fries. It was wonderful. Will be making this again for sure. Great for a quick meal.

The chicken came out great, the classic fried chicken. I brined the chicken pieces first for about an hour and a half. I just used pepper and seasoned salt with the flour in the coating. I did the frying in an electric frying pan because my cast iron skillet is tiny, it was great for controlling the oil temperature.

Although I am a seasoned cook, I have rarely made "Fried Chicken". It was always way too high fat for my family. Now with Low Carb being the way to stay healthy, I tried this fried chicken recipe (I just subbed Low Carb soy bake mix for the flour). I cooked 10 minutes a side and the outside of the chicken was VERY dark brown and the inside was still raw. I decided to cover and cook til it got to correct temperature;which took another 15 minutes or so. It was tasty, but not the best fried chicken I ever had;it was a lttle "rubbery" and yet moist.?  I will have to make a few more trys, to get the technique and timing right, I guess. I just wish the recipe had given a little more info (esp. approximate timing) for us frying chicken  "novices". AND ... WHAT do you do with all that leftover grease with all the burnt flour bits in it?

At first I was concerned about putting a cover over the chicken during frying hoping it wouldn't make the skin soggy, but no, THE SKIN CAME OUT CRISPY, CRISPY!!! I turned the heat on high when the chicken was placed in the pan in order to not have the chicken cook in slightly cooled oil, then the heat was lowered to a HEALTHY low flame, the chicken then covered and was cooked 15 minutes on each side checking to see if any coloring was needed. The onion and garlic powders and cayenne didn't come through so next time I'll adjust for flavor. This will be my go-to recipe/method for making chicken no matter the recipe. Soon I'll be using the presented method for making Maryland Fried Chicken with cream gravy where nutmeg will be used both in the coating and in the gravy.

Roll the chicken in buttermilk before you roll it in the flour that way it will stay on in the oil. You can also use milk or an egg that's beaten but buttermilk works the best.

I only fried breasts of the chicken in a cast iron skillet with canola oil, letting it heat up for a long time, I think this is key.   As suggested I did do the 20 min ice water brine, also added a bit more spice to the flour and on the chicken.   I fried the breasts about 30 minutes, flipping every 7 to 10 minutes.  Turned out crispy and brown on outside, juicy on inside.

excellent recipe for real southern fried chicken, i actually ate a chicken leg and loved it, I usually eat white meat only.  only modification I made was replace the paprika with a generous amount of msg (accent), if you are not allergic to it it won't hurt you.  I didn't add garlic and all that other stuff, that's northern fried chicken like people here in maine make, true southern frien chicken is made with flour, salt, pepper, and msg.  Self rising flour is a must, or liberally add baking powder to your flour.  Dip your rinsed wet chicken in beaten egg than roll in flour which you may add more salt and pepper (you can never use too much msg) according to your tastes.  re dip in the egg and once more in the flour and do not put it into a frying pan till the oil is 350 degrees.  with an electric you need 48 oz oil for perfection.  fry legs and thighs for at least 25 minutes, turning frequently to prevent overbrowning, do not pierce the chicken use tongs.  fry breasts a total of 30 to 40 minutes.  When your chicken is dark golden brown it's readu test with a thermometer to be sure, should be 165-190 in the thickest part.  This coating will make the juciest chicken you ever ate.  If you want, experiment with spices and make a good northern fried chicken, but if you want REAL deep south soul food fried chicken you use only salt, pepper and msg.  And if you are not allergic to msg it's perfectly safe, it's glutamate made from corn.  Good luck and bon appetite.

I can't believe how delicious this was last night. I changed it a little because I used chicken thighs, cumin, salt and pepper (ran outta paprika). I also decided to try the icey salt water before hand as many reviewers mentioned. Then, I decided to brine it for a couple hours since it was already in salt water.  I also used a viewers idea of letting the flour sit on the chicken for a half hour and then shaking it again. I don't know what variable was the key or if they all were key but this was the best fried chicken I have ever eaten let alone made myself. Yummy and simple. Just wish I could eat it more but it is def not low fat!

My Family just finiched this for dinner. While we were eating my husband looked at me and said the skin on this is perfcect. Um i used boneless skinless chicken breast. He didn't believe me i had to show him the package. I took advice from others and added garlic powder, onion powder salt and pepper to the flour, and also seasoned the meat before putting in the flour. I got distracted with the kids and overcooked the chicken but it was still good. will make again.

It was super yummy and super easy!! I was always afraid to make my own fried chicken but not anymore. I followed the directions to soak in iced salt water for 20 minutes then i coated the chicken in egg wash breaded, let sit 15 minutes coated and breaded again and it was DELISH! I added a bit lemon pepper creole seasoning and the garlic onion salt pepper and paprika!!

This was really good and easy. I used my fry daddy to cook the chicken. It is the easiest way for me to maintain proper temp. and not have to turn it. Just put it in, set the timer, and walk away. My family really likes it when I fry chicken this way. The only change I make to the recipe is to add garlic powder to the flour.

This didn't work for me.  But I think it is my lack of chicken frying ability and not the recipe.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong but this came out pretty looking but rubbery and a little bland.

This Recipe was great. The chicken came out very juicy. Although I dipped the chicken in the egg then the batter to make it a little more crunchy and it worked great for me. Also I only used salt and pepper for flavoring, which I added to the batter instead of putting it on the chicken.

Just plain 'ole good stuff. I must admit we are a savory seasoning lover family so I added some onion powder, garlic powder, fried chicken seasoning, and cayenne pepper to my chicken and the flour batter before frying. This was definitely a WINNER!!

Don't see why so many 5-star reviews, tried this recipe & found that flour comes off almost instantly. Also, had
very little flavor. Used an electric
skillet @ 365 degrees per recipe. Will
not use this recipe again.

This recipe was good but not excellent.  It didn't really stand out.  My family enjoyed it and I would make it again but I think there might be better fried chicken recipes out there....if you find one...let me know!

I fried boneless chicken breasts in a deep fryer and the chicken turned out wonderful! My family really loved it...I took the suggestions of adding some extra spices. Thanks for sharing the recipe..I will definately be making it again in the near future!

I added granulated garlic and onion, chayenne pepper, tblsp of toasted sesame seeds, and substituted salt with johnny's season salt. Took all of the ingredients and put them in a gallon ziplock bag. Cleaned up 4 Chicken breasts, filleted them in half, pounded them, and cut them into strips. Then threw them into the gallon bag and mixed up the strips thoroughly...kids and wife loved it. It was good.

Great chicken!  I only used the small 1.5 pint bottle of vegetable oil because that's all I had.  It was enough.  I dipped the chicken in milk to get it wet, then in the flour, back in the milk and back in the flour.  It gives you "club" fingers but it makes the crust crispy.  Next time I'll add onion powder and garlic salt for an extra kick in the spices.  I kept the burner on medium heat since I didn't have a thermometer for oil.

An excellent recipe.  So easy to make.  I just added some onion powder and garlic to the flour before putting it on the chicken.  Next time I'll add a little more salt (I'm an addict).

My new go-to fried chicken recipe! I was reluctant to skip the usual dipping in egg/milk before coating in flour but wanted to try this method...i figured if it works, I can skip the egg or milk & save time in the future. I'm happy to say that it worked perfectly without the egg or milk! I used chicken breasts cut into pieces and added 1 tsp garlic powder & 1/2 tsp onion powder to the flour before shaking it all up in a ziplock bag.  I used olive oil for frying. One tip... drain your fried foods on a cooking rack to keep all sides crispy (not soggy from placing on a paper towel.

It was a very bland recipe. Without having exact measurements to use there is a lot of guess work involved. I had to add a tablespoon of seasoned salt and a teaspoon of garlic salt to even get some taste out of it since regular salt didnt do the trick.

Great recipe that you can play with and add to and season to your liking! For the person who is having trouble keeping the coating on the chicken.  Make sure your oil is Heated good and hot before placing the chicken in the pan.

I have never been able to make fried chicken and get it to come out as great as this recipe! My companion who loves fried chicken says it taste better than KFC, and has asked me to make it often. Even my kids said it was the best they tasted too and could not believe it was so simple.

This was a great quick recipe. I have never fried chicken before and today was my first time and it came out great. I only used boneless chicken thighs and they were amazing, with a side dish of red skin garlic mashed potatoes. Wonderful !

Thank you for teaching me the proper way to cook chicken! I'm quite the cooker now, but about a year ago when I first tried this I was scared out of my mind. I didn't enjoy cooking, but needed to learn and this recipe made me realize that cooking isn't as hard as I thought it was. My daughters favorite meal is chicken legs and potatoes, and now I'm able to make it for her all the time.

To keep on the coating, refrigerate it for a few minutes after you bread it, 30 min. works well for me, and then fry it.  I do that for anything fried.  Good Luck!

I had never fried bone-in chicken and was also intimidated by it. I had to use a skillet on the stovetop so I wasn't sure what setting to put it on. I left it around medium most of the time and I think I should've turned it down later. I ended up cooking it probably 30-35 minutes. It was good but a little more crispy than I prefer. I did double coat it but I didn't soak it in iced saltwater and definately should have, because blood came out and caused brown/black spots on the breading. Overall it turned out good for my first time. I think next time I'll soak it first and not cook it as long.

I've never made fried chicken, but my son wanted it for his birthday party. It turned out great. 
The 14- and 15-year-old boys really made it disappear.

Very easy and very good chicken.  I sous-vide my chicken the day before, took it out of the refrigerator and let it come up to room temp, rinsed the chicken, pat dryed it, let it finishing air drying.  Put on the batter as per the instructions, it was perfect.
Thank You Chris

Not bad! Very easy to make! I think I was worried about it being cooked all the way through, so I kept it in the oil a hair longer than I should have. So definitely follow directions! I also let the chicken sit in the bag of flour (after washing them off) for about a half hour, then dipped them in egg, and in flour once more prior to putting them in the iron skillet. This definitely helped with the coating (that I used to have trouble keeping on the chicken when it cooked). My boyfriend LOVED it! This recipe will certainly be a mainstay!

I got a real good scald on the chicken. And this was the best fried chicken I have ever tasted or made for that matter.  I will be using it again.  The key is to let the oil get hot enough.

This is the way my mom made fried chicken.  It's simple and good.  I prefer to use more spices (white pepper, cayenne, poultry seasoning) and you could soak it in buttermilk ahead of time. But it's okay without all that. I would say to anyone having trouble with the crust, your oil isn't hot enough and/or you are moving it too much (don't flip it more than once.)  Also if you are burning it, you probably aren't using a heavy enough skillet. I was taught ALWAYS to fry in an iron skillet, it distributes heat equally, but if you don't have one use the heaviest one you've got. Get an iron skillet though, they are cheaper than most skillets and they last a lifetime!

Excellent recipe. I did what a few others suggested and added more spice such as garlic powder and onion powder after letting it sit in the salt water rinse for 20 minutes and draining all the water out of the pan. I added the salt pepper and paprika as well. Then I did the flour dip which I added italian seasoned bread crumbs too, then into the egg bath, then back into the flour dip.

These were big thighs so I heated the crisco shortening with vegetable oil on medium high - high while I was prepping the chicken.

I cooked each side for 5 minutes before flipping it and flipped them 2x each for a total of 20 minutes cook time and they turned out amazing!

Check the photo out :-)

Salt, pepper, smoked paprika and rolled in RICE flower. All on a paper towel.  Put in deep fryer while assembling salad.  Couldn't have found a faster way to have fried chicken - was wonderful. Hardly any clean up other than paper towels!
Thanks so much!

I had never made fried chicken before and was looking for an easy recipe - this is a good one.  I added onion powder and garlic powder as one of the other reviewers suggested.  I had to cook it longer than suggested though, after 15-20 minutes it was still a bit white.  It took about 25-30 minutes to become a nice golden brown.  I prefer a bit more breading on my chicken so I think next time I'll dip the chicken in egg wash and bread it again and see how that turns out.  Good simple recipe though.

I wished I had taken a picture of the finished chicken - however we started eating it right away! I read the comments and additional suggestions and it all came out great! Heated oil to right temperature, breading was nice and crispy without having to dip in eggs - also did put the chicken in ice cold water for 20 minutes! Do give it time to marinade!

Sorry but this is bland as all get out. personally I would add garlic powder,sage,onion powder,season salt, and soak in a buttermilk bath first. then i would shake off the excess rub the chicken with yellow mustard and add said seasons. Then I'd add the chicken to seasoned flour then fry to a golden perfection

I have made this many times in the past.  After breading chicken put in the refrigerator for a half hour or more to set coating.  Then fry.

This (no egg) is how my mom made fried chicken when I was a kid.

She'd NOT wash the chicken, leaving the sticky exterior from the package in the fridge, then just dredge in flour.  Then she'd put all the pieces on a rack and let them soak up the flour for 20 minutes or so, then dredge again.  Fry in a quarter inch of veg oil,  first one side on high heat, then flip all the pieces, turn the heat down to low medium, and put the lid on, and cook for 20 minutes.  Then make gravy with the remaining oil and fond.

This recipe is great. Very crispy!  I’ll add more of the spices and I’ll make sure to drain on paper towels, not a rack next time.

I have NEVER made good fried chicken, but today I DID!  I used all legs instead of a whole chicken.  I did want to add, when frying more than one batch, you will either need to wait for your oil to come to temperature again or it will take longer for the second batch to cook (at least that was my experience).

Had 7 lbs of chicken legs, so I Doubled everything..
Turned out fabulous. Reminded me of the fried chicken, milk gravy, and biscuits my Grandmother used to make. Was easy to follow. I froze most of it. 3 legs in a Freezer bag and Vacuum Sealed. I have many meals ready to micro and enjoy.

I'll give this 3 stars because of everyone else's reason: it's incomplete. Add some eggs and dip the chicken in the eggs before dipping it in the breading of 1 teaspoon paprika, pepper, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder as well as 1 cup of flour. Then fry it slowly at maybe medium high heat and flip every 2 minutes until it gets darker brown. I'd also make an incision in the meat to check on the pinkness every so often as well. I'd do this for about 15-30 min.

It tried it, but I think it was missing something. It was tasty, but it was also a bit bland in my opinion. Perhaps I missed something, but it needed a bit more zing to it.

I love the simplicity of this recipe. The drumsticks I made were very juicy. I loved covering the chicken to cook and only having to turn it once. However, the coating did not get very crispy. From what I understand that could be from not heating the oil properly. Next time I will look into that and maybe use more spices.

I have not had truly fried chicken at home in at least 40 years in fact I avoided it mainly do to the mess. This receipt was,as expected, a bit messy but the enjoyment of the absolutely delicious and moist chicken was worth the extra cleanup. I used Crisco instead of oil but I'm sure it will be just as good either way. I used a cast iron skillet and only cooked 5 pieces at a time which allowed for more space and easy turning of the chicken. Because I haven't done this in many years I kept checking the chicken with a meat thermometer to insure I didn't over cook them. If I change anything on this receipt I believe I might add a bit of spice to the flour mix but either way it was awesome.

I made this for dinner for my wife tonight. I suggest you read the reviews and incorporate as much advice into your recipe as you can. I added the extra spices and flour to a Ziploc bag and shook it all together. I then dipped it in egg and re-flowered it. I highly suggest you use a cast-iron skillet with peanut oil. My wife can't stop raving about it!

This was my first time making fried chicken, and I have always loved cooking and baking but I am always nervous that it won't turn out good. But when I made it, it was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside and it was  so perfect. Even my little brother tried it which was surprising cause he is super picky.

Very simple, tasty recipe. I added garlic and onion powder and used smoked Paprika instead of regular Paprika. A little chili powder can give it a nice mild spicy kick.

This recipe is quick to make and very delicious.  The best part too is that if you buy enough you can cook it all up and have cold chicken leftover. YUM...The only thing I didn't like about it was the mess it left behind with all the oil in the pan.  Makes for a messier clean up that's for sure.  Great tasting chicken though!!!

For anybody having trouble keeping the batter on, try coating the chicken in egg after seasoning and then coating it in flour

Super easy. I also dipped my chicken in eggs before coating with the flour. And used a lid on my pot.. Will make again for sure! Thank you!

This was a very easy recipe that didn't require buttermilk. I only added a bit more paprika. I have a picky child that won't eat most of the things we do, and this was a quick fix tonight :-) Thanks!

I used half oil and half vegetable shortening to fry the chicken and the skin was the crispiest ever! I used 6 large chicken thighs and there was way too much coating. I think I will make only half or a quarter of it next time.
