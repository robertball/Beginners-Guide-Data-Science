Thought this recipe was AMAZING!!!!! I used a different sauce brand other than that I stayed true to the original. Loved it and will recommend all day.

I didn't use preggo sauce and i didn't measure anything. I just added how much looked right to me, but it came out great and I'm sure I'll make it again. Even my 16 month old loved it! I served it over white rice with broccoli.
