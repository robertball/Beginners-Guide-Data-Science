Tried the Spaghetti Pie II recipe on this site and liked the ease of preparation and good taste.   Reminded me of lasange, but easier and quicker to prepare - very nice for weeknight meal.  My family enjoys Spinach Lasagne, but because of the prep involved, we don't have it that often. I searched and found this similar spinach "pasta pie" recipe.  It was quite good, and of course, easy to prepare.   The only thing I did different from the recipe was to add about 1/3 cup parmesan cheese to the spaghetti crust.  Enjoyed this dish with a side of fruit salad.
