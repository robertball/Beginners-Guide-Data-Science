I used elbow macaroni because I had some leftover. I halved the recipe but should have added the dressing gradually as it seemed to overwhelm. It was very creamy, but I'd reduce the amount of dressing, just a personal preference. I didn't add tomato and only used red peppers and a small amount of fresh mushrooms. Good to try, but I prefer oil-based Italian pasta salads when using pepperoni.

We LOVED this pasta salad! I thought it was going to end up being on the dry side, but it wasn't at all. Loved the flavors in this...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
