So my husband and I are both on diets... this was a great healthy and filling recipe for the both of us. Since we're trying to eat healthy, I did make a few adjustments that still tasted great. I used a tsp. of oil instead of a tbsp. Also, I reduced the cheese to half, and omitted the breadcrumbs altogether. It was still delicious! I would highly recommend to anyone trying to eat healthier!

These were very tasty. I didnt add the olives since I dont care for them. These would be good with a little pepperoni added ( if you arent vegetarian) I cut back a little on the cheese as there was plenty for me. The only change I think I'll make next time if pureeing the tomatoes a little bit

This was an amazing and different recipe than traditional red sauce and mozzarella cheese.  So fresh and light!  I used fresh Roma tomatoes, dried basil instead of fresh basil, and only about 4 oz of shredded of Italian cheeses instead of 8 oz of pepper jack and mozzarella shredded cheeses.  And used Panko breadcrumbs and added to Italian seasonings to it.  I like the texture of Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs.  Did not try with the black olives or pepperoni as it was suggested by others.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I would definitely make this again - I added red/green bells chopped to the tomato mixture and YUM!  I think it would make a great appetizer with baby bellas.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very tasty with lots of flavor. There should be quite a bit of flexibility allowing you to prepare most of this ahead of time then put in oven to finish. The portabello will produce liquid while cooking so I lined the backing dish with parchment to make cleanup easy.

Very good way to make portabella. I made the mistake of omitting the bread crumbs. The cups released some juice and I had to removed it using paper towels. The bread crumbs could have absorb some of that juice.
I chose to grate the tomatoes so that it feels like a pizza sauce. And since I didn't have any balsamic, I used little tomato paste for more flavor and color.

Easy and delicious! I didn't have fresh tomatoes so sauteed everything with fire roasted diced tomatoes from Trader Joe's

This was really good!  Very quick and simple.  I used fresh diced tomatoes (romas), fresh basil and fresh mozzarella.  I left out the parsley, red pepper flakes and olives-just our taste.  It was still very flavorful.  Next time I will use shredded mozzarella because the fresh does not melt as well.  A very filling meal.  I served with chicken sausages for more protein but that wasn't even really necessary.  I nice salad would be enough of a side with this dish.

Delicious! I omitted the breadcrumbs and olives and it turned it great. Super easy and satisfying substitute for meat which looks great too!
