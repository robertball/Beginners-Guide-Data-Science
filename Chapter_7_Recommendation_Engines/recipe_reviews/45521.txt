This is very, very good. So simple and so elegant, the tastes complement each other perfectly. I used half the fat and a whole bottle of sherry. Will definitely make this again, a great holiday treat. Thank you for sharing.

"Luscious" is the word that pops into your brain as soon as you taste this Rabbit Italian Style. "Decadent" and "rich" follow. And could it be any easier? Less than a handful of ingredients, super simple - literally fool proof to make, A+ for recipes like this. I added a thin-sliced onion and don't regret it. Thank you for this recipe!

This was a great recipe. The problem is, rabbit is rabbit. Especially when your boyfriend hit it with his car.
