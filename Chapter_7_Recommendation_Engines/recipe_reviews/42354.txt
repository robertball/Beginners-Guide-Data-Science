I did not have raspberry or strawberry pie filling but I did have one large bag of frozen berries. I made my own pie filling (water, sugar, vanilla extract, and cornstarch) with the berries. The end result was almost like a mousse that tricks you and makes you think you're having a sorbet or frozen yogurt. It's hard to describe. My husband wasn't keen on it but the boys and I absolutely loved it. I'll make this again but I think I might lighten it up and just use frozen berries and eliminate the "pie filling" part of it.

We really like this stuff...my grandma made it every Christmas when I was growing up. I prefer it with cherry pie filling.

I made this and it came out the way it is supposed to. However the taste is gross. It tastes like Strawberry flavored sweetened condensed milk. Both my fiance & I hated it. Which was very depressing because we were very excited to try it...especially after waiting 8 hours for it to freeze. :(

I made this recipe using strawberry and pineapple. My kids loved it for an afternoon snack on a hot day. It's very nice and refreshing!

I made this for a potluck and everyone LOVED it! I used 1 can of raspberry pie filling and 1 can of blackberry pie filling and no pineapple.  I might try it with the pineapple next time. Very refreshing and summery!

This was good after I played with the ingrdeients some.   I  use strawberry pie filling and rasberry pie filling, added a banana and pineapple tidbits.  Now it is yummy.  3 1/2 stars
