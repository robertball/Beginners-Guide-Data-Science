I was a little nervous when making this pie because I never seen or heard of it before, but the ingredients are what peaked my curiousity & of course my Grandmother's confirmation that it's old favorite. Well it was truly delicious. I made 2 for Thanksgiving. Instead of using all Vanilla Extract, I added 1/2 Tblspn. of Vanilla Extract & 1/2 Tblspn. Lemon Extract. Next time I won't preheat the oven too long, there was too much spilling over & I'll use a deep dish pie crust. This is a keeper.

This was definitely an easy recipe to prepare.  However, I found that the top gets too brown when you cook it for an hour.  I would suggest covering the top with aluminum foil to prevent this.  I had hoped the final result would be a little lighter.

Is this recipe using condensed milk or evaporated milk.  In the summary states condensed, but in recipe states evaporated.  Used this recipe with the evaporated and seemed to be runny after cooking.  Let it cook for another 20 minutes and filling was thicker, but was very sweet.

This is one of my favorite chess pie recipes, my grandmother says that it is better than hers and she is going on 80. Chess pie is my favorite and I just love this recipe hands down.

This was great! My first time making it, super easy.  I suggest using a deeper pie pan thought to avoid any spillage.  I had to cook it a little longer than an hour and I let it cool for a bit to have it set.  I will for sure make this again!

This was delish! I had never had Chess Pie but my husband requested it. It's so easy to make and the custard center was smooth and creamy. Loved it. Thanks!

Excellent recipe! This is definitely a keeper.I found out it needs an extra 15 to 20 minutes more on bake time for firming the center of pie.Other then that it's the best I've ever tasted. KUDOS!!!

Can't go wrong with this recipe.  Good Stuff.  This is the 4th recipe I've used to make chess pie and this one is the best IMHO.

Recipe was super easy to follow and the result was delicious! I used a Keebler shortbread pie crust (the ready made) instead of the unbaked pie crust and it worked just fine, too!

I'd never heard of a Chess Pie but saw it while looking at reviews for Sugar Pie. I made one last night and I am pretty sure the Sugar Pie recipe will go behind this one.  Oh my gosh, it was perfect.  Hubby has a sweet tooth and this made his day.  The only thing I did different was to use milk because i didn't want to open a large can of evap. milk. It didn't seem to hurt it any.  Thanks Beth!

Makess a beautiful pie. However, it is definitely not my favorite recipe. WAy too much cornmeal.  Pie also come  out a little greasy instead of creamy.  It had an eggy taste too. My favorite recipe uses sweetened condensed milk which gives the pie a creamy texture. It also only contains 3 eggs and only 1-1/2 teaspoons of cornmeal. I wonder if the 1 tablespoon of cornmeal is a misprint. Pie comes out gritty.

Love a good chess pie, and this is it!  Such a great finish to a good old Southern dinner (which is a major treat since we are currently living abroad).  Thank goodness for great recipes from home.  Thanks for this one!  Will make again, for sure.

Great Pie! I did make a few changes. I like a real full, thick Chess Pie so, I added 1 egg, used a whole stick of butter, about 1/4 cup more sugar, and 8 oz. of evap. milk. Fills a deep dish shell perfectly! You do have to cook a little longer,  cook until set. Love it!

I first heard about chess pie 6 years ago. I have never ate it nor made it. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception. I used 2 tablespoons of jiffy corn bread mix instead of 2 tablespoons of plain cornmeal. That is what I had at hand. I did preheat the oven 20 minutes before starting. I covered the edges of the pie crust with foil. I placed the pie in the middle of the oven to cook on top of a cookie sheet. My pie was not runny. It cooked in exactly 60 minutes. The top had a golden-brown finish. I inserted a toothpick in the middle and it came out clean. It was super amazing. This is the ONLY recipe for chess pie I ever want to use!

It doesn't make a pretty party pie but has a wonderful flavor. The only change I made was to cut the sugar in half since we are watching our sugar.... will definitely make it again.

This is exactly the same recipe I have followed for years. But we call it Cornmeal Pie here in southern Indiana.  Love it! One of my favorites. I only use 1 1/2 cups of sugar just an individual taste. But over all this is exactly the same recipe. Excellent!

Considering how many people love this recipe, I am assuming I did something wrong. The liquid mix looked right, but when the pie was baking it formed a crack in the top just before the filling set.  I cooked it a few more minutes to finish setting, but the crack filled with liquid butter.  After cooling, the crack sort of went away as the puffiness of the hot pie contracted, and the butter sort of disappeared back into the pie, but the whole texture ended up all wrong.  Really, really, really greasy and grainy, and flattened out, and it tastes kind of like egg and sugar.  When I softened my butter at the start, I microwaved it a little and it partially melted, and I am assuming that could be the problem.  So I  recommend your butter to be only soft and not melted if you want to try this recipe.  Other than that I cannot figure out why mine turned out so bad.

I just made this and it turned out great. I was worried about the cooking time due to other reviewers saying it wasn't done in the center. When my timer went off I turned off the oven and let it stay in there for about 15 minutes or so and when I took it out it was fine.
