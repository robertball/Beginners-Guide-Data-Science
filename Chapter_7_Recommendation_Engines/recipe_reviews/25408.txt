Okay, not bad, but where's the excitement, the color, the zip?  To the meat, rice and eggs, add a bit of finely chopped onion and a little parsley.  Shape into meatballs and put in single layer on the bottom of the baking pan.  Now, here's the secret!!  Chop a couple carrots and celery stalks and sprinkle over and around the meatballs.  Cover with a can of tomato soup and a can of diced tomatoes, with juice.  Sprinkle with a little garlic powder and maybe a dash of worcestershire sauce.  This makes delicious gravy to serve over mashed potatoes.  Just be sure to bake long enough to make vegies soft.  My mother always served this with green beans, applesauce and cottage cheese.  Make a double batch.  It freezes well, if you are lucky enough to have any leftovers!!

My mom called these porquipine balls.  They are basically the same thing.  There are a few differences from my mom's recipe though.  We precook the rice so you don't have the issue with the rice not cooking.  I use about a cup of cooked rice to about a pound of meat.  Browned the meat balls for color.  Used two cans of soup and reduced the water.  Added a little bit of worchestshire sauce for zip.  I think adding the veggies as another reviewer suggested is a great idea.  I will try that next time.

I'm giving this three stars because it's a great -base- but it's missing important ingredients.  

I also know these as porcupines, but the main and most important (to my crew) ingredient is missing.. Chopped (or minced) onion. I add 1/2 to 1 onion, which is more than my original recipe called for but it adds great flavor. 

Be sure to -brown- these, don't just toss raw meatballs into the sauce (ick). This makes a yummy 'byproduct' of the browned bits in the pan.. the rice is not cooked soft (haven't added any sauce and finished cooking it yet..) but by the time the porcupine balls are browned, there are crispy bits of browned onion/rice/hamburger bits. The cook and whoever is wandering by generally gets a taste. 

Add garlic and Worcestershire to the sauce mix as well as salt and pepper.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! But----to make them just like my grandma used to, I added a large pinch of cloves, cinnamon, about a tablespoon of sugar, and about a fourth cup of cider vinegar---very Polish!  Yummy with noodles or mashed potatoes--this is comfort food!

My mom made these and called them porcupine meatballs.  She used instant rice and it worked fine.  But she made hers just like you make meatloaf with onions, peppers, everything except the tomatoes.  She then dropped the meatballs into hot home canned tomatoes and cooked until done.  She served hers with mashed potatoes, green peas and biscuits.  We got a lot of laughs when we told others we had porcupine meatballs.  We waited a few to let them know it was beef, not porcupine meat.  I am 52 and still make them to this day.  She got the recipe off a drive-in movie screen.

This was very good...except I modified it a little.  I cooked the rice first, and instead of using tomato soup, I used cream of mushroom.  As per other reviewers, I also added some seasonings (garlic, paprika, rosemary/thyme blend) and minced onion and green pepper.

I give this 4 stars with some revisions as these would be so bland without some seasonings.  I mix some minced onion, garlic powder, worchestshire, a little chili powder and some salt and pepper into my meatballs.  Into the sauce I put more worchestshire, a little brown sugar, some beef boullion, a couple of tablespoons of wine vinegar or lemon juice, and a secret ingredient - 1/2 tsp. ground cloves.  I've also used tomato juice in the sauce with success.  The sauce is a little sweet and sour.  We too call these porcupine meatballs, and we have them all the time.

I think the kids would like this, but I agree with other reviewers it will need some seasoning! I would also try different soups, eg chicken/mushroom, maybe thick veggie. Would be nice with some grated cheese on top too.

Depending on the audience, I might put some more in the ball mix too, maybe chopped onion, or chillies. Probably a little grated garlic?

I went by the suggestions of others, and added seasoning to meat.  This came out very good.  My picky 11 year old loves it.

This recipe, which we fondly remember being called Porcupines was much better when my mother made it. Her recipe was seasoned so very much better!  Re: Hedgehogs, for fun see -http://www.cafepress.com/hhvalley

Not too bad!! I added minced onion, garlic powder, a liitle onion salt, a dash of worchestshire sauce and salt and pepper to my meat mixture. I also browned the meatballs first before adding to the soup. I served with mashed potatos and melted cheese on top. My boyfriend really liked them!! I liked them better the next day as leftovers. Will probably make again. Thanks!!

These are a lot of fun for the children to help out with.  My children enjoy mixing and shaping the "meatballs".  We have subsituted different sauces for the tomato soup... They really love spaghetti sauce.  My hubby prefers a brown gravy over them.  Terrific meal.

While I didnt try this actual recipe I grew up with something similar. My mom called it porkupine meatballs and used milk instead of water and some onions. She mixed the rice, meat, onions, some soup and milk into the meatballs themselves then poured the remaining soup milk mixture under and over top of the meatballs and then slow cooked them for 8 hrs on low. Still a favorite of mine and now my daughter.

Good, but average. Added seasoning, of course. Browned the porcupine balls before adding soup. Oh! And used cooked rice, since I don't have instant. Thus, I did lower water by about 1/2 cup. Soup still turned out plenty thick enough for a "gravy". Served with a cabbage salad (often seen as a Chinese chicken salad). Had plenty for leftovers tomorrow, even with everyone eating 2-3 a piece.

Our family recipe is called porcupine meatballs as well and contains chopped onions in the meatballs and has tomato juice instead of tomato soup and water.  We place meatballs in a roasting pan or a crock pot and then add on peeled chopped potatos and lengthwise sliced carrots.  fill the pan or crock pot 1/2 to 3/4 full with tomato juice.   Wonderful for those cold winter days.

This was great! We did use some left over already cooked rice (1 cup, per another reviewer's suggestion) and only 1 pound of ground beef because we were only feeding three. Also, as with just about any other recipe we use, we seasoned the meat to our liking (added some dried onion too), and we also added some Italian seasoning and pepper to the soup.  We only had a can of cream of tomato on hand that was ready to serve, not condensed, and it made for a great sauce - I do wonder if 1/2 condensed soup and 1/2 water might be too watery... We also browned the hedgehogs in a little olive oil in a pan before putting them in the sauce to simmer.  Anyways - we served it with mashed potatoes and peas like others suggestions, and it made for a great comforting meal on a cold fall night.  THANK YOU!!

I used to make these when i first left home,nice nostalgic recipe. Someone asked how to get the rice to cook then add the water when it is boiling.
I make this with lots of fresh basil in now for flavour.

I added some spices to this recipe (the original seemed quite bland) and I browned the meatballs before adding them to the tomato base. Overall, we liked them , but this recipe is extremely heavy (even with served with steamed vegetables and salad).  I doubt that I will make this as a main course again; however, I might make a smaller-sized version for an appetizer at dinner parties. I made a meatball sub for my husband's lunch with the leftovers, he liked that better than the original dish!

This is a good recipe. It reminded me of stuffed cabbage just withouth the bloating cabbage wrapped around the meatball. I also cooked the rice first and added more onion. I was worried it might be to soupy so I added a can of tomato sauce. It was delicious served over mashed potatoes. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I grew up on this stuff...but we called it porccupines.  I remember it being much more flavorful though.  This was extremely bland.  The soup is much too watery to be the base.  I tried to add some tomoto paste to thicken it up, but it was still watery.  I may attempt the recipe again, but next time I'll add some salt and spices to give it some flavor.

I made this dish all by myself.  I'm 11, so when I say this recipe is easy and fun, you'd better believe it!  I found it to be a little bland though, so I put in a little bit of Worcestershire sauce, BBQ sauce, salt and pepper and it was perfected. My rating was based on how it was before I doctored it. My rating for after I doctored it however, is 5 stars.

The family loved this! I did add about two tablespoons of Zataran's seasoning salt to the meat mixture, as well as, chopped green onions, bell peppers, about two tablespoons of onion powder and two tablespoons of garlic powder.  I also used Chunky Campbell's zesty tomato Bisque as well....it gave it a little more flavor.  I served over steamed white rice, with mixed veggies.  The only downside is that it doesn't look all that appetizing, but I'll work on that.

As it is written, very bland indeed.  I took the advice of others and added minced onion to the burger and pre-cooked the rice and browned the meatballs.  I also added seasonings and worcestershire sauce to the soup and garnished with shredded cheese.  Those changes made it a three or four star (thanks other reviewers!).

These are easy and fast. I agree with other reviews, though, that the rice was crunchy. And I added garlic, salt, pepper and W. sauce as recommended, and that made the sauce more flavorful.

My mom made a version of this and we called it stuffed cabbage. Using basically the same recipe, except first parboiling cabbage and stuffing the 'balls' into a leaf and folding it shut. Pour the soup over and either slow stove top cook it or bake. Yummy!

Easy enough.  A nice change for lunch.  My picky 11 year old ate it.  I didn't want to eat it on more starch, so we ate it more like a soup.

Yummy. I cooked these for about two hours because I made them too big, and I also added garlic and chili powder and worcestshire sauce and cheddar cheese.

The basics for this recipe are ok but it is too bland. I added seasoning salt/pepper/basil/cayenne pepper/chili powder/onion powder. Also added touch of liquid smoke, angostura bitters and soya sauce. Meat came out very moist and the kids said it tasted like "more."

I give this recipe a 3 because all in all it's a good basis to work with.  The meatballs definately needed seasoning. I followed other reviews and added garlic salt, pepper, worschester and parsley.  The tomato base was fine for a sauce my kids liked it as well.

It was good. I like ground beef and sometimes run out of ideas for something new. This was a great alternative to meatloaf. I added slices of fresh cheddar cheese over the meat balls which added a little kick.

I really loved these! I didnt have tomato soup, so instead I used one 15 ounce can of tomato sauce with one can of water, I also had scaled the recipe down by using 1 1/2 pounds of meat. They turned out great!

My guys really enjoyed it.  We really liked the tomato gravy over garlic mashed potatos.  But I will spice it up a little next time.  Salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley....that should do it.
