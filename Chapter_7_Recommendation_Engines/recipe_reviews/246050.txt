There is a lot about this recipe I really liked, and I will make it again with what I have learned.   Next time I will cook the onions longer, until they are caramelized, and  I will add some dimension with a touch of cayenne and mustard.  I did appreciate that there was no flour needed, the sauce was thick without it.  Thank you Ericsonpad

I used chicken/mushroom soup. Combined cauliflower and broccoli. And it came out awesome.

This was so delicious, I will be making again. I only used one head of cauliflower, but kept the other ingredients the same. The best part about this dish was the onions. I cut them up very small, caramelized them, and they were for sure the ingredient that made the dish. Its very close to a baked Mac and cheese dish.

I made it and is a huge hit. I did not use the soup and I mixed the crackers in with the cauliflower and topped with cracker.  I love it and will be making it again......
