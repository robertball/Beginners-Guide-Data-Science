Very decadent oatmeal recipe! It was a nice treat, but not something I'd make every day. It was definitely tasty, but very rich. If I make this again, I'll either use light coconut milk, or use half coconut milk/half water. I only used half the amount of honey and half the brown sugar and that was plenty sweet for me, but given that the name of the recipe is Sweet Coconut Oatmeal, you may wish to use the full amount, and yes, it will be sweet! I also used unsweetened coconut, and sprinkled some over top before serving.

I made this recipe exactly as listed except, I had no canned coconut milk, so I used Silk Coconut milk. It was tasty, and with the Silk coconut milk it has a lot fewer calories than the canned. I topped it with raw honey, a handful of blueberries and a splash of coconut milk. I would most definitely make it again.

This was tasty. However light coconut milk will definitely be the replacement next time. Or just half can and half water... This Was a bit too rich and thick.

This was delicious! I had half a can of coconut milk left over and was scouting Allrecipes for a way to put it to use. I used 2/3 c of coconut milk, about 1 c water, 1 c rolled oats, and 5 generous dashes of cinnamon. I brought the coconut milk and water to a gentle boil (barely looked like boiling) with the lid on the pot - took about 20 minutes. After mixing the oatmeal in, I let it sit for 15 minutes without the lid, then stirred in cinnamon and immediately removed the pot from the stove. The oatmeal was rich and creamy, with a perfect amount of coconut and cinnamon flavor. 10/10 would make again

This is unbelievably delicious.  It is so creamy and smooth.  I would not be able to make it everyday so I would have to tweak it, but otherwise...you must try it!  If you like coconut, this is for you.

Decadent. Flavorful in an almost rice pudding way but warm and Christmasy. Golden raisins and pecans would take it next level.

Never could I have imagine oatmeal with coconut. Especially the milk of the coconut. It is wonderfully tasty and I think it may have just been added to my oatmeal week.

Along with my PB Oatmeal and Almond Oatmeal Recipe I do every day of the week.
