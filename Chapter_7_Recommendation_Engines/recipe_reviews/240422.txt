Soooo good! The condensed milk makes it the most deliciously rich hot chocolate I've ever had. I'm sure they serve this in heaven. 
My husband loves this the next day...over coffee ice cubes. I'm considering putting those coffee ice cubes, with the cold hot chocolate, in my Ninja blender....a little Kahlua...or Bailey's...oh my.

It tastes different than any other homemade hot chocolate I've made and I have tried many over the years. I followed the recipe using Trader Joes Belgian 72% dark chocolate. The chocolate was right on but the recipe was a bit too sweet, even for a sweet tooth like me! I would use half of the sweetened condensed milk next time.

This is the thickest, richest hot cocoa ever and deserving of it's name.  I make it once each year on the day my sister and I get together for baking/crafting before Christmas.

Very sweet very chocolaty... And we love chocolate but we kept adding milk and adding milk still very sweet and very rich in chocolate. We will use half of condensed milk and half of chocolate next time. I will give it another chance.. Everyone poured their mug back into pot so mom can try to fix it! :(

I am a chocoholic, I confess. This was THE best hot chocolate I've ever had! The calories are the only thing that will keep me from having a cup every night! Definitely a holiday treat!!

I rarely leave reviews, but had to for this one.  Truly excellent recipe! We made it and watched the polar express! Get the bittersweet chocolate chips - any other varieties would be too sweet.  It makes a lot. Good with marshmallows or with whipped cream.  Stays warm in a crock pot on warm once made.  Highly recommend for a special treat - really rich and smooth and yummy.  We loved it!

Wonderful!  This looks just like the recipe I used to make for my children growing up. They and all their neighborhood friends couldn't get enough! The only difference is that I used European stye cocoa instead of the chocolate chips. Hershey's actually has it, so it's not so hard to find. It is quicker, also. Thanks for  a great memory!

I used Ghirardelli 60 % cacao chips and all other ingredients exactly as stated. I made sure to use the good Tahitian vanilla.
Excellent! I would only recommend 2 changes to the steps. I will heat the milk before adding the chocolate and I will chop up the chips so that it decreases melting time. We will make it again.

I wouldn't change a thing unless I could make the calories disappear. I'd just said this week that I was going on a quest for the best hot cocoa around. Well that was a short journey. I've found it! It's like "sipping chocolate" that I've had in NYC.

Loved this hot chocolat; a perfect Christmas Day treat.  It definitely needed to be cut with milk before serving.  I will use less condensed milk next time.  I added Baileys to mine and will be adding coffee for guests tomorrow!

We will never buy hot chocolate again! This recipe is excellent! But I agree with other reviewers that, as is, it is too sweet.  Increased all ingredients,  except the sweetened condensed milk,  by 50%, and it was still pretty sweet.  I had leftover heavy cream and ended up adding the rest of it at the end.  All in all,  great recipe!

I made this in a cast iron Dutch oven over a fire at an outdoor party I had and gave it to all the kids. They gave it rave reviews and several said it was the BEST hot chocolate they’ve ever had!

I’m not a fan of chocolate and This was delicious. I did use 100% cacao unsweetened block of chocolate and blended it with the condensed milk and a little of the milk prior to heating. Made it endlessly smooth and tasty!

This amazing! I put in about 1/2 teas cinnamon to make Mexican hot chocolate. I used half n half because that's what I had. So yummy! So smooth! Topped with a marshmallow. Perfect for a snow day!

Idk the brand but there used to sell polar express hot chocote it was original and peppermint with cracked pieces in it. It was sold at Sam's club the year the movie came out. In very decorative tins. Then within the year couldn't find them anywhere but eBay. For more then the $10.00 sam's was selling it for. EBay started there 's @ $60.00 and that was low bidinng.
So I am glad I see. This recipe hope its'sweet creamy mix with lots of pepperment .

This was really good but be warned it is very rich.  It also turns out pretty thick.  I will probably dilute it a with the extra milk next time around.   I made this up in a crock pot  which worked pretty well  -.needed a lot of stirring as the chocolate melted but was fine after that and stayed warm until people were ready for it.  I noticed the chocolate tends to separate out and solidify on top as it cools, not sure what to do about that except drink it faster.

Loved it.   A little thick so I will thin it out a little next time.   Great flavor.    They sell condensed milk in chocolate now so I wonder would it hurt the already great flavor

I made this for New Years day.  I'm not much of a cook and this sounded simple and easy.  Just one pot, low heat, readily available ingredients with some measuring.  What could go wrong?  I made it exactly as written and after stirring for 30 minutes the chocolate chips were melted I guess.  I wasn't sure because although everything seemed smooth there were lots and lots of little tiny  dark chocolate colored specks throughout the mixture.  I decided to continue stirring  on low heat for another 10 minutes to see if these needed to "melt" and become incorporated with the mix.  That didn't work so I decided to try the hot chocolate as is.  Everyone thought it was OK but they would also have been happy with Swiss Miss and extra marshallows.  I put the mix into the crock pot as suggested to try some later.   Later arrived and all of the chocolate specks were floating on the top and had to be stirred into the hot chocolate.  Taste was still OK but I wanted GREAT after stirring for 40 minutes.  Much later arrived and everything had thickened.  Stirring didn't help and I ended up with chocolatety lumpy porridge.   Bah Hum Bug.  I gave it 3 stars because I'm sure I messed up somehow.  I did learn to test new recipies before the gathering!
