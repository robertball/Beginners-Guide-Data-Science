This is a great basic recipe. I tasted it as written and thought it was really good- especially for such a simple recipe! I did add some things to my final dressing though: 1/8 ts. garlic JUICE, 1t white rice vinegar, 3 drops sesame oil- these additions (at least for me) made this dressing PERFECT!

I could totally drink this stuff!  I added rice vinegar and used fresh ginger instead of ground.  I made this twice, once with honey the other with white sugar...my fam and I prefer the sugar.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

Just what I was looking for!  Taste almost like a Japanese Steak house's ginger house dressing.

Really good. I used honey,fresh ginger and Miracle Whip. I would like to try with yogurt instead of mayo and adding a bit of sesame oil next time. Very addicting!!! THANK YOU!

I'm not a fan of changing recipes then reviewing them, especially since I gave it five stars but this is a very good recipe, just needed a little extra. Used fresh ginger instead of powdered and added rice vinegar (a good tablespoon or so) and a dash of sesame oil. WOW!! What a great dressing!! Used it on fresh spinach and it was perfect!! The flavors are identical to the restaurant type but since its mayo based, stays creamy. This will definitely be one of my "go to" dressings!!

This dressing is awesome!!!! I did add more fresh ginger than called for, for some extra zip. I also used honey instead of sugar. Better than any of the restaurants that I have had.

This is more like the Japanese Steakhouse dressings than any other recipe I have tried. It could use some tweaking though. I'll have to experiment and see.

I love this dressing.  I was looking for something to make my raw ginger with.  I stumbled upon this recipe.  I didn't measure anything accurately (not enough time!) and I replaced the white sugar with 2 packets of Truvia.  This is excellent.  I used it on my salad with raw spinach, onion, beet, chicken, avocado and tomato.  I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe because of the 5 star rating and I don't think it's worthy of 5 stars. It was ok, but the ginger is much too strong. I think it'd be better with less ginger and maybe some lemon juice or vinegar to counter the strong ginger flavor.

This is a great recipe Countryboy.... I made the recipe with sushi ginger (sliced ginger from asian section of store) and since I didn't want lots of calories I cut back on the sugar.  After I made it my taster and I felt there was something missing... So I added Horseradish (to taste) and a dash of salt to bring out the flavors. It was perfect! Thanks!

This is a great tasting salad dressing. I must agree with the majority of the reviewers to replace the sugar with honey. I also used freshly minced ginger which gave it a spicy kick, much like the dressing served at Japanese Steak Houses.

OMG  I loved this dressing.  Hats off to Jesse and his willingness to experiment.  I changed little.  I ran out of soy sauce after 1 1/4 tablespoons so I added some rice vinegar as others had. I also added just a bit more ginger.   I  had the neighbor come over to taste it it was soooo good.

I tried the recipe as written and found it to thick and spicy. I added liquid to loosen it up. Next time I will cut back the ginger a little or try fresh ginger. I normally like food with a kick there was just a little to much kick in this. I will try this again just not exactly as written. I think for health reasons I will substitute yogurt for the mayonnaise.

This dressing is awesome.  I am diabetic, so I omitted the sugar and it is very good.  I am sure that Splenda or honey would work well in place of the sugar.   YUMMY!!!!!

This is good as is, but I added more ginger (fresh grated instead of the ground) and a little extra sugar and a splash of rice wine vinegar. This made it so much better. Thanks for the recipe!

super simple and spot on. We cut the ginger back to 1.5 tbsp per less than 5 star reviews and it's nailed Japanese style ginger dressing.

Followed recipe as printed.   Really like recipes such as this using readily available ingredients.  Excellent results.  Making another batch for the weekend at the lake.  Highly recommended.

I too could drink this stuff.  I did use fresh ginger and stevia instead of sugar.  I also used 1/2 light and 1/2 full flavor mayo just because I was emptying a jar of light mayo.  If you wanted to save calories,  you could probably just use light mayo.  Wonderful recipe.  My kids loved it on baked fish.

This is the second recipe I tried. And it is so close to what I normally get at a Japanese steak house. Although I liked the taste of the recipe as is I did add a tablespoon of rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons of water and about a teaspoon and a half of lemon juice.

I loved it. Made it with 2 TBS fresh ginger. Put everything including ginger in Vitamix. Nice ginger taste ., just like Japanese sushi restaurants. We had a salad in Hawaii - Japanese influence - made from water cress , grated carrots and firm tofu  that I made and served with this dressing ..It was a hit. Too bad it's mostly mayo. I might try it with Greek yogurt instead.

I have made this a couple of times and it is very good.  It is not exactly what I have had at the Japanese restaurants, but still very tasty.  I add a clove of garlic and a little sesame oil as well. I agree that some rice wine vinegar and fresh ginger would be good as well so I will likely try that next time.

I had high hopes for this dressing because the ingredients intrigued me. However, the flavor of it just wasn't to my liking. Tried to pull it out with adding something, but still nothing helped. Sorry won't make again.

Great base recipe! I combined this with other recipes I found to make what they serve in Japanese restaurants.  I didn't measure anything (sorry!) but I did cut back on mayo to about half cup, added the TINNIEST touch of sesame oil,squirt of lemon juice, and maybe a tablespoon or so of rice vinegar.  I didn't add any sugar but I did add A LOT more ginger...I just kept grating it in until it tasted right..will be making this again!

Loved this recipe! I used fresh ginger, honey, rice vinegar, and about 1 T. of lime juice. It was so good! Oh, and I used a blender because I don't have a food processor and it turned out fine.

So good. SO good. I followed the advice of Donna and added a bit of garlic, rice wine vinegar and sesame oil. Served it over spinach, toasted sesame seeds, toasted silvered almonds, and craisins. Amazing.
