I like to use fresh tomatoes thinly sliced instead of canned. They overlap on the top of the crust. I have also added thinly sliced onion (think Vadalia or red) and bleu cheese crumbles. I will make this for an upcoming class reunion with all these toppings in strips on a sheet pizza so I need to bake only one, but will have many options on that one.

I made this with my 5 year old daughter. She loved making it and the whole family enjoyed eating it!
We'll definitely make it again.
