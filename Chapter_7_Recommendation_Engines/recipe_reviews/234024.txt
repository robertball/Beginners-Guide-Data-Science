I was a little wary when I realized our fresh garlic was spoiled and I'd need to use jarred minced in it's stead.  However, even with the necessary sub it was still great!  I left out the capers per personal preference.  It came together quickly and really satisfied my craving for a caesar salad.  It'd be nice w/some anchovies.  THANKS for the recipe!

YUM! The only change I made was adding a whole egg, and  not adding bacon or capers which no doubt would have only made  the dressing even better! 
Go Canada!
