This was delicious and filling. I used cavatappi pasta, and three slices of bacon. Also used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes. In order to keep the bacon crispy, I removed it from the pan when it was done, then continued on with the recipe. Ended up sprinkling the bacon on top of each plate of pasta. My picky 2 1/2 year old loved this dinner!
