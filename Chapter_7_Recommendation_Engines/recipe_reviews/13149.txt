This is a fantastic recipe.  The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because it needed a little tweaking.  I used 2 tbsp. olive oil and 2 tbsp. butter as suggested by another reviewer.  I used 2 1/2 cups of ready to use chicken broth from the box and 2 1/2 cups of water and I omitted the powder and soy sauce.  The soup didn't need any salt.  I added 1 garlic clove and 1 more medium-sized potato.  I used very little cream but the soup doesn't need it.  I may leave the cream as a garnish next time to be served at the table.  It was delicious.

Lots of changes to this but still really good base.  I don't believe in the "M" word so I used butter.  There must have been an omission of the garlic so I added four cloves.  I used homemade chicken stock without the bouillon cubes.  We don't cook with salt and that is all they tend to add to your cooking.  Added the tips after the 20 min boil along with four large chopped mushrooms.  In each bowl we added another teaspoon of butter and served it with homemade marjoram bread.  The perfect easy dinner.  Great blend of celery, garlic, onion, and asparagus.  It also helped to use organic asparagus that was the best we had ever tasted.  On the table was pepper and sea salt for those that needed more of either.

Absolutely delicious!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and sauted the onion and celery in butter and olive oil.  Also, the measurement for the bouillon couldn't be right.  That would be the equivalent of 12 cubes.  (Perhaps they meant 4 tsp.) I used 2 cubes and 2 packets of low-sodium bouillon, along with a 14 oz. can of broth.  Came out perfect.  I didn't puree all of the soup so there would be some chunks.  Will make the next time and add chicken and mushrooms.

I followed a lot of the suggestions of others, but with a few changes of my own.  

I used 3 cans of broth and 1 "can" of water w/ two bouillon for my stock.  I used 3 poptatoes and added 4 small-medium carrots.  When chopping the asparagas, I left the tips off to the side for later.  In the stock, I boiled the potatoes, carrots, and asparagas stalks.  While that was boiling I sauted the onion and celery (and the added garlic).  

When all of that was ready, I pulled about 2/3 of the potatoe/carrotasparagas mixture and about 2/3 of the onion/celery/garlic mixture with a slotted spoon to be pureed (along with some of the broth for a liquid).

After removin everything that will be pureed, I then added the asparagas tips into the boiling stck.  With the remainder of the onion/celery/garlic mix, I then added the flour, which was then added to the stock.  I then added the pureed mixture back to the pot and brought the mixture back to a boil on simmer.  I added 8 oz. of heavy cream, but I can see where that would be optional.

When served, I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese.

This was a huge hit.  My husband and I were fighting over who got to take the one serving of left overs with them to work for lunch the next day. Having it partially pureed but leaving some pieces to bite into was great.  I will definitely be doing this again the exact same way I did this time.

Note: soy sauce was NOT used, and I think that was the right choice.

Mmmmm...yummy in the tummy!  I used olive oil instead of the margarine, and added 4 cloves of garlic to the celery and onions.  Also, I followed the advice of others and only used 2 chicken bouillion cubes.  The only other substitution I made was to use about 1/3 cup of fat free half-and-half (Land O Lakes brand) instead of the 1/2 cup of the real thing...you can't tell the difference and it cuts out a lot of the fat from this recipe.  This soup is really easy to make and oh so good!

I've been excited to try this soup since I made my grocery list. It didn't let me down. I decreased the ckn bouillon to 4 teaspoons,I used 5 cups ckn broth instead of water and condensed ckn broth, and i saved some tips of the asparagus. This is one of my favorites. My husband has put it on his favorite list too. Thank-you william for sharing with everyone.

As others have stated, the original recipe was extremely salty.  

I eliminated the chicken broth, bumped the water to 5 cups,  added 1 bouillon cube, 3 potatoes, 1 celery stalk and did NOT puree a thing.  

It now has a more chowder texture and is extremely popular with our family and friends.

This was the first recipe that I had used off of this site.  Fantastic!

I took the advice of others and cut back on the butter by half and added 2 cloves of garlic to the veggies. I also used a good solid chicken base instead of the chicken bouillon powder. Added more asparagus and DIDNOT puree any of it. I had some roasted chicken from the night before and added the left-overs.If you don't have half and half on hand, don't go out and buy it, you don't need it. A wonderful soup indeed!

This was delicious! I inadvertently over-marinated some chicken breasts in soy sauce and lemon juice and was about to toss them out when I found this recipe (using the "ingredient search" feature on allrecipes, I might add!:) I first grilled the chicken----gotta love George Foreman!----and omitted the soy sauce that this recipe called for. Based on other reviews, as well as our preference for more texture, I didn't puree the ingredients. The soup was even better the next day! Sounds contradictory, but the asparagus and celery were soft yet at the same time had a crispness to them (chopped in bite-sized or smaller than bite-sized pieces, and used olive oil to saute. Also, didn't have any white pepper on hand, so I added a bit more black pepper and it was fine). Although this recipe doesn't call for chicken, it made for a heartier soup and saved me from a marinating disaster. Thank you William!

This was really good. I did make some alterations. I didn't have soy sauce, so omitted that. I used my hand held mixer and pureed everything but there were still clumps so I strained it. Turned out pretty good. Oh I used evaporated skim milk in place of 1/2 and 1/2 to make it fat free.

I have been searching for a good asparagus soup recipe for a couple of years...this one wins!!  I feel like the slight changes I made added a ton of extra flavor.  The changes were: I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil for cooking onions and celery, used 4 bouillon cubes and a tad extra water, added 3 pressed cloves of garlic, and went with a couple dashes soy sauce, dash of red (cayenne) pepper, dash of seasoning salt, and about 1/4tsp adobo seasoning.  So delicious!  We have been eating it nonstop since I made it...thank you!

Loved this recipe.  As others suggested I used 2 TBS butter and olive oil instead of all butter.  Added a 2nd potato,  saved the tips and added them last.  Also used all chicken broth rather than water and buillon.  Was delicious!

another version to this soup is to garnish with basil/goat cheese balls. May sound strange, but is absolutly delecious!!  Recipe: Mix 2 TBSP fresh chopped basil to 1/2 Cup goat cheese, spray melon ball scooper with cooking spray, scoop cheese balls onto parchment covered cookie sheet and refridgerate 1/2 hour. Drop a ball into each bowl of hot soup. The flavors of the asparagus and goat cheese complment each other very very well. Enjoy.  P.S. I make the soup pretty much  the same as all of u except i do use fresh leeks instead of onions. I thinly slice the white and the light green part of the leek and saute in olive oil along with chopped garlic. Also just before blending or pureeing, i'll add a tbsp or two of fresh chopped basil leaves.

This soup was delicious.  It turned out a bit salty but this is because I used salted butter.  Next time I will cut out some of the salt.

Outstanding!! I make a lot of soup and this one will now go into the regular line up as a favorite. I preferr real broth to powder boullion, so I used all broth. I also used 1 cup "heavy" cream instead of 3/4 C half and half. I like my soup chunky and hearty so the puree was skipped. I also used 4 med sized red skin potatoes(unpealed)and diced petite,sauted along with the clery and onion.A few sprigs of minced fresh parsley added as well. Use the best ingredients and the freshest veggies and this soup will have you craving more!! My family loved it!! Thanks William for sharing this great recipe.

I made this for my family after they had complained that my husband (of 8 months) was getting all the enjoyment of my culinary experiments.

They absolutely loved it. My little sister (age 10) licked the bowl clean. My dad asked for seconds. My mom - who was supposed to be on a diet took a half a plate in the kitchen when no one was looking :D -- the thing is though - I made it less fattening - I didn't use margerine or butter when sauteeing the onions and celery (I only used a bit of olive oil) and I didn't add the half and half - the soup was definitely creamy enough without it. I did take some of the other reviewer's advice and added less soy sauce and a little less of the bouillon powder.

I substituted EVOO + sunflower oil for the margarine, added 4 cloves garlic, used 2 leeks instead of onion, 2 cups home-made chicken stock + 1 cup water and 1 cup dry white wine, no flour (potato thickens it just fine), reserved the asparagus tips + added after pureeing, used a few Tbs half&half & yoghurt, then topped with creamy goat cheese & chiffonnade of fresh basil. Delicious. I'd give it five stars, but with so many substitutions, I can't say it's the same recipe!

I've been looking for a good cream of asparagus soup recipe and finally found it! The only change I made was to cut down the number of servings as I don't need to make a large amount. Wouldn't change a thing otherwise! Thanks!

Super tasty. Next time though I will use just a bit less soy sauce so it's not as salt.

Followed the adaptations and advice from the commentors below i.e. used 2 tbsp butter and olive oil, added garlic, did not use bullion and no soy sauce. Did add a leek as well.  A little on the bland side but as the soup sat, it got tastier. A nice light seasonal dish!

After reading other reviews I adjusted the recipe as I did it.  I sauteed the onion, celery and potato with 1 clove of chopped garlic.  I used liquid chicken oxo and added as needed.  I used black and white pepper but found that the soup didn't need any salt, it was quite salty on its own.  It also didn't need the soy sauce, that would have put the saltiness over the top.  Used my hand blender on it and it was terrific.

I just got done eating this yummy soup.  It took me a little longer than I expected but then again I always UNDER estimate cooking times when I cook cus I love it so much.  Reading the reviews I thought this was going to be way to salty so I used 4 cups of boxed low sodium chicken broth (store brand) and one cup of water, no bullion.  I ended adding a little salt while I ate it. I also added 4 cloves of garlic and did not use soy sauce…sounded kind of weird to me. JMO. I also used two medium red potatoes diced. FYI: be careful when you purée the hot soup. I put too much in my blender and it popped the top off and I was covered in hot soup. OUCH! This was a very good very light dinner. I served with Italian bread with butter, dry oregano and dried basil toasted under the broiler. My hubby really liked it!  I will for sure be making this again! Maybe next time for lunch instead of dinner.***I MADE THIS AGIAN BUT DOUBLED THE RECIPE.  I USED 8 CUPS CHICKEN BROTH WITH NO WATER OR BOUILON.... VERY VERY GOOD!!***

Excellent recipe, we added MUCH more white and black pepper then called for, and this really made the soup better for us, try adding more to taste and offering it on the table as well. Also decreased the bouillion significantly to decrease salt. Sometimes I use 4-6 cups chicken broth and no boullion or condensed broth, it just depends what I have on hand, but always a huge favorite with friends and family. I have also used fat free half and half or skim milk if it just for family (saves calories, but not quite as rich).

Very good. I added a diced clove of garlic per other users suggestions & I didn't use bouillon powder since I had enough chicken stock on hand. I used my immersion blender to puree the soup & it worked like a charm. Thanks for a great spring recipe!

Great recipe...mixed it with the comments of Lorax42. We added lemon juice, montreal seasoning and old bay. A little sugar brought it to new heights...will deffinately make again.

loved it!!!  Also like previous - used EVOO instead of margarine.  Also only used a splash of cream.  And no bouillion cubes, no water and all chicken broth.

I give this 4 starts but only after reheating it the next day. I made it pretty much according to the recipe (I did add garlic) and I was disappointed because it seemed bland. After letting the flavors blend overnight though, it is really very good.

Amazing.  Goofed and added 10.5 oz chix broth instead of 5.25.  Did not add half & half as others suggested.  Totally fine without it.  Wow.  So good and super easy!

Delicious!  I took other's advice and used 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water.  Sauted the onion and celery with some garlic and mushrooms and boiled the asparagus and potato first.  Excellent flavor!

Fantastic Soup!!  I made as an entry to dinner and everyone wanted to stop with the soup.  I followed the recipe except I used 3 cans of chicken broth and one cup water.  I also used some extra asparagus tips and tender pieces steamed for about 2 minutes and added them to the soup at the end.  I topped with a tsp. of sour cream.  Was delicious.  Will add to my favorite recipes book and will use it often.

Excellent soup!  Added a diced carrot, and sauted veggies with garlic.  Used all chicken broth instead of water and also added about another 2tbs of flour / 1/3 cup water to thicken it more.  Didn't totally puree - I like it more chunky.  Only added one boullion cube and the salt was perfect.

Use red wine vinegar instead of soy sauce.  It gives it a better "punch".  Also added a pound of chopped mushrooms and topped it with a fresh basil/red onion mixture for freshness.  This would also be a great base just for a creamed mushroom soup.  If you are looking to reduce calories, it tastes great even without the half & half.

My whole family loved this soup!  I used 4 knorr bullion cubes and the 4 cups of water and no stock.  I also added  another potato to make it creamier. I blended it and saved some cooked peices to cut up into bits. Very yummy!!!

Since some commented on the saltiness and I didn't have chix bouillon I used 3 cans (equivalent 42oz) of low sodium chicken broth instead of the 10oz can of broth, bouillion, and 4 c. water (also 42 oz). Wonderful soup!!

Mmm...mmm...good!!  I did do a bit of tweaking, per past recommendations and what was in my fridge.  Instead of the water and condensed chicken broth, I used 5 cups of chicken broth.  Also used 4 teaspoons chicken boullion, 2 potatoes, one tablespoon chopped garlic, and a cup of sliced mushrooms.  Also substituted worchestire for soy sauce, and added a dash of paprika.  Pureed the whole thing.  My brother ate the batch I made for his family...without sharing any with his wife.  He said he couldn't help himself!

I've made this soup several times and it is wonderful!  The only changes I made is using 3T of the boouillon powder instead of 4.  Also, I add lots of chopped garlic when browing onions.  I'll be anxiously awaiting the height of next years asparagus crop so I can make lots more of this great soup!!  Thanks William for sharing!!

I just made the soup right now and man, it's soooo good!  My sister, who hates asparagus, thought it was good too.  I took other's suggestions and used only 2 buillon and instead of margarine, used butter and olive oil and it turned out fine.

Fabulous!  I did, however, make some adjustments.  First, vegetarian broth makes this a delicious and healthy veg meal!  I used 5 cups water and 4 veg boullion cubes.  I also did not add any broth (had a naturally creamy texture and taste without it!) and also no additional S/P or soy sauce.  I will definately be making this again the next time asparagus is on sale!  :)

So good! I added two garlic cloves, used olive oil in place of margarine and used 3 bouillon cubes, 1.5 cups of water, and 2 cups of chicken broth. No soy sauce was needed. I used whole milk in place of half and half and bumped up the ground peppers, along with a few dashes of hot sauce since we like our soup to have a little bite. This soup was delicious! I served this with homemade pumpernickel garlic croutons. I will definitely make this again. **Update: I made this again and it's better without the half and half and I don't puree it. I have made this several times and sometimes leave out the potato (don't always have it) and add some raw cubed chicken and let it simmer until done. So good!

I didn't have any chicken bouillon, so I used 4 cups of stock instead. It still tasted a little bland, so I added some "Fox Point Seasoning" from Penzeys Spices. Terrific soup, warm and hearty on a cold day. Would be better if the tips were reserved and added back in after pureeing.

Delicious and very easy to make.  Before blending it I took out some chucks of asparagus to put back in the soup (like in the picture) and it was very good this way.  I added garlic and I omitted the soy sauce.

Very, very nice soup. Followed recipe with minor change - 1/2 whipping cream with 1/2 skim milk (all I had). Soooo much better than canned soup. Will do again. Dollop of sour cream on top would have been nice.

Great recipe that I made even better!  I used four potatoes and that thickened the soup enough that the flour was not necessary.  I used 32 oz of low-sodium chicken broth instead of the water/boullion specifed.  I also added a lot of garlic and cooked a red paper with the other veggies for flavor.  Outstanding soup with grain bread.  Try it.  There won't be any left over!  Enjoy!

I read the other reviews before I made this soup. My changes: two dollops of minced garlic, three chicken bouillion cubes instead of 4 tablespoons, low-fat milk and a dollop of low-fat sour cream in place of half and half (got to be a little virtuous!). AWESOME soup that just got better the next day! As we New Orleanians say,"So good it makes you want to slap your mama!" Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Awesome! I modified just a little using better than bouillon chicken flavor and pureed half the soup.  I like a substance to my soup.  I was skeptical on putting the soy sauce in fear that it would hinder the taste.  It was great.  I ate almost all of it myself.

This recipe was delicious!  I decided to omit the soy sauce just because I do not care for salt.  I also sautéed sliced mushrooms and added them to the soup at the very end; as well as reserve some asparagus tips and add to the soup with the mushrooms.

Excellent. Quick, easy and very flavorsome. My only complaint is that it was a little too salty (AND I omitted the soy sauce as I didn't like the idea of it in the soup). Great recipe. Thanks, William!

THIS IS THE ABSOULTE BEST SOUP I'VE EVER  TASTED. I USED THE TIPS OF THE ASPARAGUS FOR GARNISH. NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU PUREE THE ASPARAGUS VERY WELL, SO YOU DON'T HAVE STRINGY PIECES IN YOUR SOUP.

I got raves for this soup. I adjusted the recipe for 7 people (there were 5 of us). Everyone had seconds and there was still enough for leftovers. When my sister saw me preparing the veggies, she said, "asparagus?" disparagingly, but quickly changed her tune when she tasted it. I served it w/some diced red and yellow peppers in the middle for a garnish. I filing this one away for future use.

I really enjoyed this one...I used butter, onion, celery, 1/2 package of white mushrooms then sautéed for awhile then added the flour, cooked for awhile then added water, chicken boullion paste, a little salt, pepper,4 cloves of garlic, brought to a boil then added 1 lb asparagus. Cooked this for awhile then used an immersion blender to blend about a 1/3rd of it. Added about 3 cups of 2% milk, slowly brought back the heat and then added another lb of asparagus so it still a bit "crunchy" rather than "mushy". I did add the soy sauce which I find adds nice depth to creamed soups. Served with warm baguettes...

Great result.  Doubled entire recipe and used 4 cups of purchased chicken brothand 5 cubes of chicken bouillon and reduced the water to adjust liquid content, and, otherwise followed recipe.  No additional salt needed with soy sauce.

This soup is amazing!  It's creamy and tasty.  I used milk instead of half and half, just because that's what I had on hand.  Added some garlic when sauteing in the beginning and omitted celery. That's what's up!

i did make the soup without the potato & soy sauce and flour. too many unecessary calories. i made mine with asparagus tips only , then added chic .broth a few cooked veggies corn starch, garlic pepper kosher salt.& scallions. put everything in my vita mix  and then strained  it. cooked it until it thickened and boy was it delicious. my favorite soup now.

Amazingly wonderful recipe!  I doubled it for bottling and it is simply flavorful, smooth and delicious. Definitely my favorite asparagus soup recipe to date.  
Next time for serving I will add whole chunks of the asparagus for a beautiful display.

This soup had a very nice favor but much too salty. I would omit the soy sauce, and use low sodium products.  I also used Soy Milk instead of half & half.

I like asparagus, but I don't love it. However, this soup is excellent--so excellent that I made it twice in one week. In my opinion, the half-and-half is not needed. As others suggested, I swapped the margarine for 2 T each of olive oil and butter, added 4 cloves of garlic to the celery and onion, and I added fresh lemon juice at the end. FYI: I made my own broth using chicken, lamb and pork bones I had on hand instead of the condensed broth. It was yummy.

Loved this!!!  I made it exactly as written, minus the soy sauce.  And I will do it again and again and again.  I am thinking this would be perfect with any vegetable combination:  mushroom, carrot, tomato, celery, squash, etc.  Both my husband and I finished the entire batch in one sitting -- it was THAT good!  Highly recommend it.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

I am glad that this stuff turned out so good because my girlfriend did not care for it and I ended up eating the whole pot of soup by myself. I think I added a few baby carrots for color and cut the soy sauce in half but this soup would be good with or without those changes.

Used just-picked asparagus and I only had College Inn "culinary broth," which contains herbs.  I also was out of celery, so I skipped that.  Absolutely fantastic!!!

This soup is delicious.  Instead of chicken boillon I used McCormick powder poultry/turkey gravy mix.  It adds the same flavor to me w/out the salt flavor and adds a little thickening.  I saved the tops (steamed them) and added them to the soup in the end.  I would also add a less water and more cream.  But, if you're watching calories, it's great.  Will definitely make again.

Great soup!  I only had a sweet potatoe so I used it instead and it was great.  I also removed about a quarter of the veggies before pureeing to give some more texture.  I will deffinitely be making this again.

I did make some changes to this recipe... I used 2 1/2 cups of sodium-free vegetable stock and 2 cups of water in place of what the recipe suggested, and I left out the celery and soy sauce. I put in maybe a half teaspoon of salt and a very liberal amount of pepper to make up for the lack of saltiness. However, the asparagus flavor definitely showed through and tastes really great combined with the starchiness of the potatoes. I over pureed mine though--next time when I make it I will leave some chunks of asparagus and potato. This is excellent with herb bread or crumbled blue corn chips. Thanks for the great recipe!

So good, but I did alter a bit. Sauteed 2 sliced red potatoes for about 10 minutes with onions, carrots, celery and garlic. Then added broth & seasonings, one cup frozen chopped spinach & 2 cups frozen broccoli florets, simmered for 10 more minutes. Added one can asparagus (cut into small pieces) and the half-n-half, brought back to simmer, turned off immediately. YUM! Did not need flour, not concerned about the soup being really thick.

This soup is amazing. My family thought it was amazing. My family ate the soup with crackers. I did make a few changes to the recipe. I have a big family so i had to double the recipe but if your not doubling the recipe... use 2 tbsp. olive oil and 2 tbsp. butter. 1 medium onion, 3 stalks of celery, 3tbsp. flour. 5 cups of water with 3 cubes chicken bouillon and 1 tsp. vegeta. 2 medium sized potatoes. 2 cloves garlic minced. 1 pound asparagus and 3/4 cup milk instead of cream. I didn't add soy sauce, and i only added 1/2 tsp black pepper. Turned out amazing:)

Wonderful recipe!  Just a few small changes- I used fat-free half and half (unfortunately, I was dieting at the time, but it didn't hinder the taste or texture at all!) and reserved pieces of asparagus (not just tips) to add to the texture.  Like others, I like some "chunks" in my soup.  A keeper!

I am giving this a 5 but I agree with other reviewers.  This soup is way too salty using 4 tbls of chicken bouillon and 4 cups of water.  I had to add more water to correct it - making the soup thinner that I would have liked.  The next time I am just going to use all chicken broth instead of bothering with the bouillon powder and I may use a bit less broth than called for or add more asparagus.  Thanks submitter.

Simple, delicious, dependable.  Serve it as readily for a regular weekend dinner in season and for most special company during the holidays.  (Against doctor's wishes!!!) I use a half stick more butter and a bit more half and half.  Strictly the best!

Made this last night and really enjoyed it. I ended up using 2 potatoes because I was using idaho golds and they are rather small, everything else was the same though. Soup from scratch is time consuming, but well worth the effort. Everyone loved it. Thanks so much!

Great recipe, used beef broth and beef bullion because i was out of chicken and it was just as good as the first time when I used chicken.  Double the butter and replace some of the water with half and half and it's even richer...  haha

I too decided to save several asparagus tips and some stems because I like "chunky" soup.  I also added fresh chives - added color and flavor.  For an added twist (because I love garlic!) I sauteed minced garlic in the butter before adding flour.  The soup was VERY tasty and I will definitely make it again.  This was the first time I had cooked vegetables (onion, celery and asparagus) and then pureed them in a blender - it worked great!

This soup was wonderful. I was out of onion and substitued a cup of chopped mushrooms (and reduced the bouillon to 3 tbls.), and it turned out lovely. A word of CAUTION, though. If you must use a regular blender, as I did, let the soup cool down a bit before blending. The steam built up in my blender and the thing exploded all over me when I turned it on, despite my having the lid held tightly on. Besides making a huge mess, I got a pretty bad burn on my arm. But really, you must try the soup.

I'm glad I made a practice batch.  Definitely too salty using 4T bouillon powder!  Minus the salt, the flavor was deicious.  Will adjust bouillon to 4 tsp next round.  I liked the pureed version.  I don't like to know I'm eating cooked celery.  May add a bit more flour for thickness next time.

I wish I had found this recipe sooner!  I saw a review, and decided I needed to make this soup today!  I had to go with what I had..I had to used three shallots since I had no onion, and used two potatoes because I had just slightly under 1 lb of asparagus.  I also added two chopped garlic cloves.  This soup is so fantastic that I am having trouble waiting for dinner tonight.  I used a hand blended right in the pot, and left a few chunks of veggies.  So easy and so delicious!

Wow, what a delicious soup, everyone loved it and it was gone in a flash.  I did make a couple of changes also after reading the other reviews.  I omitted the bouillion powder and used 2 chicken bouillon cubes, used olive oil instead of margarine, put in 2 medium potatoes, and omitted the cream. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful soup, it is now on the top of my list of favorite soups.

This was very good! We were looking for a nice healthy meal that was different from our usual selections and this was perfect! It’s very low fat and low calorie but still has a great flavor and is filling. It’s full of great veggies! We both had several bowls and took some for our lunches the next day.

I used butter instead of margarine.  I used a sweet Vidalia onion.   Added 3/4 tsp of herbs de Provence and omitted soya sauce(soup base has enough salt). I used a carton of sodium reduced chicken broth to which I added 11/4 cups water and 3 tbsp of chicken soup base. Didn’t have half and half cream so I used 4 frozen cubes of whipping cream defrosted and added 1% milk to make the 3/4 cup quantity. To me the herbs made all the difference from the first time I followed the recipe. Salt and pepper to taste.

After make another recipe that used just the tips of the asparagus, I needed something to make with the remain 80% of the asparagus stalks. This recipe hit the spot!  It's easy to make and the flavor is amazing.

I made as directed (decreasing the bouillon amount). Other asparagus soup recipes included lemon, so my only real change was to substitute lemon pepper for the 2 peppers. We thought it was good but not necessarily a soup I'd dream about.  I think it can be better. Will probably attempt again and make modifications to increase the 'Wow' factor.

This was good. Used soymilk instead of cream and all broth, instead of the water, as I had no boullion. Worked fine this way, but didn't have the same oomph as it would have, had I used cream. Knowing this, I popped in some feta at the end. Also, added 4 or 5 garlic cloves, as it just wasnt super flavorful without it. Good recipe that can be tweaked to suit your tastes and what you have on hand.

Very nice, I tried to stick to the recipe so I could really taste it the original way.  However, I do think by looking at the recipe there is too much salt so I did only use 2Tbps of ckn powder and only 1/2Tbp of soy sauce and I think it was perfect.  Many said they used garlic(I usually always add it) but I didn't want to take away from the wonderful asparagus taste and it didn't need the garlic at all.  I also used the hand blender and it worked fine except for a few pieces of the ends of some of the asparagus, so either cut those smaller than the rest of the asparagus or use blender next time.The only reason I used 4 stars is that I believe the recipe calls for too much salt. Will make again.

This was wonderful, although I did make some changes.  For chicken broth I used 4 cups of water and 4 tsp chicken bouillon paste. I peeled and coarsely chopped the asparagus before adding it to the soup. I weighed the asparagus after it was peeled and trimmed. I pureed the soup so that it was slightly chunky instead of baby food consistency.  I added 1/2 cup heavy cream instead of half and half.  I think I could add less cream and less butter next time and it would still taste good. Because we are a GF household, I used 2 tbsp rice flour and 1 tbsp almond meal. I did not add pepper or soy sauce since the soup tasted great the way it was.

I did not care for this recipe.  It is so salty.  SO SALTY!!!  If you make the recipe as is you can maybe cut it with 2 parts water and make broth of chicken/asparagus but that's about it.

I used 2 tbsp butter and 2 of olive oil instead of margarine, only 1/2 cup of cream and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. It was good though. Even my picky 7-year old carnivore didn't mind eating it. I think you could leave out the cream entirely if you wanted it to be lactose free.

We really like this soup, even my husband who isnt too crazy about asparagus! We have made it several times now. My modifications: -Melt butter along with 2 tbsp minced garlic and 2 tbsp olive oil. -Use cream of chicken soup instead of condensed broth. -Use 3 potatoes instead of 1. -Soy sauce optional. YUM!

Delicious! I added two cloves of garlic, sauteed the onion & celery with just enough grapeseed oil instead of using margarine, left out the dairy and used all black pepper since I don't have white. 

This was the perfect way to use up some asparagus that was looking a little too limp and dried out for anything else.

This took some doing to make the first time, but I'll definitely be doing it again so it should be faster in the future. Creamy, healthy-tasting (sort of), and so so good.

A big hit here.  I used all chicken broth (no water) and 2 cubes of bouillion and a package of onion soup, since I didn't have the condensed chicken broth.  I skipped the soy sauce and it was salty enough for my saltoholic husband.  Probably a little too salty for the average person, but it had a great flavor.

Wonderful Flavors. I did add 5 cloves of garlic, some extra potatoes and used 5 cups of chicken broth, instead of the granules.I pureed in the same pot eliminating that additional step. There are so many things you can add to this for variety. Next time I'll try a chunkier version. A definite keeper. Toasted garlic bread on the side you have yourself a hardy fresh tasting soup. Thank You For Sharing

This is a good jumping-off point. For our tastes I found I needed to add minced garlic and crushed red pepper to the soup. We garnished with real bacon bits and hot sauce (a fairly common occurrence around here, and not a dig at the recipe really). I upped the flour & switched the half & half out for milk. Thanks for the recipe!

Great soup. My teen daughter keep "testing" the flavor as I was cooking and made several comments about how good it was. She has never tasted asparagus soup before, so I was a bit worried that she wouldn't care for it.   I did use more potatoes than called for and left them in chunks along with some of the asparagus, as we prefer more texture in our soup.   I will be making this winner again!

Exceptional Recipe!  I read the comments and was going to adhere to the recipe despite what I read but then I too realized that the amount of boullion powder was just too much. I used one tablespoon and was very impressed with the flavor.  I didn't make any other changes.  My husband said this one was surely a keeper.

I have made this several times and it's always a hit. It's very easy to make. I try to reduce the sodium by reducing the chicken broth and soy sauce or substituting low sodium versions of both. It has the same great taste. You'll love the soup!

Delicious veggie soup.  Since I used cream of celery, it tasted like celery.

Changes:
olive oil instead of mararine
6 celery stalks
6 cups water
1 can cream of celery soup
2 cubes beef bullion
sweet potato instead of regular
Eliminated half-and-half

This is a very tasty soup that is not too hard to make.  At least for a rookie like me, I think more time should be allotted because you have to blend the soup after boiling it.  This can be a challenge with very hot soup swirling around in plastic, so it we be wise to cool it first, which adds time.

Totally awsome soup, the only thing I would do is use low sodium chicken bouillon powder, the salt was a little overwhelming if you had a meal sized bowl.

Wow - I can't believe how good this soup is!!  I made a few minor changes (following the suggestions of other reviewers); here is what I did.  I used 2 1/2 cups of water and 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth (reduced sodium) along with 2 packets of powdered chicken bouillon.  I also sauteed the onion and celery in about 3 Tbsp of butter and 1 Tbsp of olive oil (adding a bit of sea salt to help draw moisture out of the vegetables).  I also omitted the soy sauce (because I forgot to add it).  Lastly, I reduced the amount of cream to 1/2 cup (I used 10% BF cream).  Once everything was cooked I used my immersion blender to puree everything; the end result was absolutely delicious...company worthy for sure!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The rave reviews led me to expect better.  It should be named cream of celery soup, as that is the predominant flavor.    If I made it again I would use only 1 stalk... or try one of the many other recipes on this site.  Sorry.

I only gave 4 stars because I used the "most helpful," suggestions.  I used 5 cups of reduced sodium chicken broth, I didn't use soy sauce or chicken "powder". I added garlic and red pepper flakes. I did not puree, but used a potato masher to condense it down.  I only used about half of the 1/2 & 1/2 called for.  I know it's not fair to rate a recipe when you don't follow it as written, but I was worried about calories, fat and sodium.  Thank you for sharing.  I really did like this and would never think to make asparagus soup, but I will in the future.

My wife and I love this recipe. Like some other reviewers, I used 5 cups of chicken broth instead of the water, broth, and bouillon mixture. I made this recipe with broccoli instead of asparagus one night, and it came out great!

This is my first soup made at home from scratch. It turned out great! I made it for Family Pumpkin Carving Night, and EVERYBODY loved it, even the kids (and these kids are hard to please). 

Although I honestly thought it was just a bit too "peppery", everyone else said that it was perfect. Even my cousin (who is the pickiest eater I know, she actually turned her nose up at it) took the the leftovers home, although there wasn't much left.

I expected the soup to turn out a little creamer than it did, but again, it tasted great. I also picked out the top of the asparagus and put it back in the soup after I pureed it (my father's idea). I didn't puree it for that long, because I like a chunkier soup.

ALL IN ALL, THIS SOUP WAS AWESOME!!!

This is a fantastic soup.  I read the reviews for it before making it and adjusted mine by only adding 1 1/2 Tablespoons of Chicken Bouillon Powder instead of the 4 that the recipe recommends and it came out magnifico.  A definite do again.

I sell asparagus from my own 1/3 of an acre field and this recipe has gotten me a lot of customers. The only thing I do differnt is I saute all my veggies in bacon grease and I use equal amounts of potatoes and asparagus. This could be served in a restraunt very easily.

This soup is delicious! It tastes like something you would get in a really great restaurant. I had no condensed chicken stock so I used OXO chicken bullion powder, 5 tablespoons with 5 cups water. I topped with finely grated parmesan cheese. I highly recommend this recipe! Yum!!!

Easy and quick!  I used an extra potato to make it thicker.  I also just used 5 large bouillon cubes and 6C of water (no condensed broth or powder)- maybe still a little too salty.  Used regular milk and left out the celery and white pepper because I didn't have any.  Used one very large onion.  Delicious!  I bet it would be good with broccoli too.

I made this tonight and it was excellent.  I made a few changes though.  I left out the celery as I am not a celery fan.  I cut the chicken bouillon powder down to 4 teaspoons and used low soduim soy to cut down the sodium.  I also substitued skim milk for the half and half to cut down the fat.  After pureeing the soup I pushed it though a fine sieve to remove any small lumps (mainly for the kids benefit).  I would definitely make this again.

I thought this soup was delicious, used Low salt broth and
chicken packets. Only thing about it I didn't like was that
it was too thin. Next time I won't puree it that much, but
the taste was great. My husband who doesn't like asparagus
that much said it was very good!

Maybe it was the chicken base I used but it was a bit overpowering and salty tasting. Next time I'll add less of that. I like onion so I added more. I also used 4 c. Milk and 1 1/2c. Water and no 1/2 & 1/2. It made it rich and creamy. Since when I eat soup I like to have something to chew and not suck it through a straw I skipped putting it in the food processor or blender. Overall it was very quick to make, simple and tasty. I will make this again. I may even try making different "cream of" soups with this same recipe.

Followed the directions as described, except I used beef cubes instead of the chicken base, because I didn't have chicken base and didn't add the soy sauce.  It was wonderful.  I used the blender and it came out smooth and delicious.  Pretty easy to make, good even for a weekday meal!

This was better then my moms version. I am not the best soup cook. I followed the directions exactly, and it was perfect. My 5 year old son loved it, after I told him it was "Hulk" soup. Very good, I did however prefer to set a few pieces of cooked asparagus to the side and then added them  after blending. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good.  I forgot to add the flowur into the sauted veggies.   But added it later.  I also added an extra potato.  It turned out a little thick after I put it in the food processor.  I also used skim milk instead of half and half.   I'll probably make again.

Wonderful soup - excellent texture and flavor.  I used two cans of chicken stock, 4 bouillon cubes & 2 1/2 cups water.  Other than that, follwed exactly and it turned out sooo yummy.  I'd give this one 6 stars if it was an option!

Wonderful.  I almost always change some things in recipes, but this time I did it exactly as the recipe said and we love it.  I did use about every pan in my kitchen, but next time will be more careful.  The blender makes it much smoother than the food processor.  I used both so dirtied both!

Wonderfull!  Of course the kids wouldn't eat it, they don't mind asparugus, but this was pushing it!  I used 2 potatoes, chicken bullion and water, and did without the half & half and soy sauce.

This was excellent. We are big asparagus fans and this was the first time we'd had it in soup. Good idea!

This was a real winner.  I used water and bouillon because I didn't have broth in the house.  Worked out fine.

Doubled the asparagus, omitted the half and half. It was a hit even with guests who claim they don't like asparagus!

This was fabulous!  I added a couple cloves of garlic & did not add the half & half to the whole soup-- I just trickled it over the soup before serving.  My husband DiD say he wanted a little more substance, so maybe next time I'll add chicken.  Very easy to prepare, very fast, great!!

My brother asked me to make Cream of Asparagus soup, I had never made it, I came here for the recipe and boy am I glad I did, the soup was better then any restaurant Asparagus soup I have ever had.  Note: It is nice to garnish with a few blanched asparagus tops.

We loved this soup...very tasty and delicious!  I agree with previous reviewer that the bouillon amount is incorrect...should be teaspoons, not Tablespoons...I used teaspoons and it turned out perfect.  Also agree that half/half is not needed.

This soup was terrific!  I used 1/2 the celery and only 1/2 cup of half and half (it was creamy enough on it's own), I let it simmer 10 minutes longer,  and it was perfect.  I thought the only thing it needed was maybe a little salt and slightly more pepper.  But my husband and I LOVED it, I can't wait to serve it to guests!

This was a very good soup. I didn't have celery so I omitted that but it still came out great. The broth was really flavorful. You don't really even need the cream. I will make this again for sure.

When I prepared this soup I cut the boullion in half after reading the other reviews about how salty this recipe is.  That was really the only substantial change I made and it turned out great! My husband loved it and wants it again.  And he is not even a big asparagus lover like I am!

This was a very enjoyable soup.  I think next time I will scale back on the pepper just a little and let each person season it individually.  I will also let it puree in the blender longer than I did.  Some asparagus tends to have fibers left.  But I will make this soup again.

I loved this recipe! Very good soup and my 6 year old likes it too! One of the best Cream of Asparagus soups I have had. I think I would cut back on the white pepper as I am not a white pepper fan. I would saute that in at the beginning next time.

I love this soup.  However, after reading everyone's remarks about the soup being too salty, I changed things a bit.  I used low sodium chicken broth and one chicken bouillan cube.  I tasted the soup after pureeing it and I ended up adding the soy sauce because it was not salty enough!  I didn't add the half-n-half because it tasted great without the extra fat.  I will definitely make this again.

I was very disappointed, I won't be making it again and I love Asparagus!  To be fair to the recipe, Florida does not get the best quality Asparagus, so maybe fresh snapped would have improved the flavor.

Omitting the soy sauce results in a greener, "cleaner" looking soup without sacrificing flavor.  Also substitute 1/2 extra virgin olive oil and 1/2 butter for the margarine for a more pure taste.

This is a winner! It reminded me of the cream soups I get from a certain restaurant. Also, my mother, who learned to hate asparagus from bad childhood experiences, loved this soup. She enjoyed it even more two days after it was cooked. Next time I'll opt to leave out the half and half, the soup is rich enough without it. Thanks.

I used broccoli stock (from when I last cooked broccoli) instead of water. My family loved this soup. I will use the base for other vegetable soups. I served it with a baguette.

I cooked a large quantity of asparagus so had a lot left over.   
      Cannot waste ANY food  so I had saved the woody ends which I had broken off and cut into one Inch pieces.  Cooked these in about a cup of water, saved the cooking water and ran the cooked pieces thru the Foley food mill.  I then added this to my soup as I was making it.  I made it as directed with one exception - I used whole milk instead of cream.
Delicious!!

This soup is delicious. The only change I made was using 1/2 tsp black pepper because I did not have the other peppers. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Flavor is mild and texture very smooth. Will definitely make again

Wonderful soup! I doubled the recipe so my husband & I could enjoy it again.  

Changes I made:   Didn't use flour--just added 1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup;  used 8 cups of chicken broth,  3/4 cups of Pinot Grecio , plus 1 cup of water instead of the liquids listed; used coconut aminos in place of soy; added 6 garlic cloves, herbs  de provence, 1/4 cup of sugar, 2 Tbsp Old Bay seasoning, some basil, & substituted 2 tsp lemon pepper instead of black pepper.

Used sour cream instead of half & half (didn't have any), left the skin on the 4 red potatoes that I used, added a 1/2 cup or so of very tiny chopped baby carrots, then topped finished soup in soup bowls with shredded Guyere cheese.

Double and triple the batch size.... Way to delicious to just have for one night. No soy or celery... used both chicken and beef for a protein.

This was truly a 5-star soup!  I added two cloves of fresh garlic, about 1/2 tablespoon of Herbs de Provence, chicken broth instead of water and 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon to amp up the chicken flavor, and substituted Paleo Flour for thickener instead of wheat flour.  Blended everything with the immersion blender and then added the asparagus tips.  It was wonderful!!!

Yes,  like most everyone else, I also thought the amount of chicken boullion was a typo.  I have made the before and this is round 2!  It was SO delicious!  I just mashed up my soup with a potato masher a little bit.  I like having the chunks of asparagus and potato!  This recipe....DIVINE!

I made with a few changes (butter, homemade broth) but otherwise did as directed with homegrown asparagus.  My VERY finicky son ate the whole bowl and asked for more.  What a great way to get the vitamins in him.  Definite keeper for this house.

This soup was excellent!  I added a handful of spinach to the simmering veggies. After blending smooth, I added about a cup of asparagus tips, cut in about 1/4 in. pieces, 3 thinly sliced green onions, and 1/2 cup coconut milk, and simmered 5 min. longer.(I like something to chew on!) The white pepper really adds a nice zip to it. I did use 2 tbs. butter instead of margarine.

Delicious!  Followed recipe but added 1 big clove of minced garlic and 2 thinly sliced carrots.  I didn't catch the "condensed" chicken broth until right before preparing so I just used a can of regular broth.  As far as the boullion powder, the type I was using called for 2 tsp. per cup of water so that's what I used and the salt content was fine.  Skipped the soy sauce because it sounded like it didn't belong and used an immersion blender; left some chunks of vegetables.  Good with and without half n' half.  Tasty and easy.  Will definitely make again.  Good with a pinch of cayenne pepper, too.  I think some ham would be good too.

Excellent!  Lots of flavor.  I used vegetable broth instead of the water/chicken bouillon.   I also left it a little chunky while immersion blending.

It's a keeper

I had leftover fresh asparagus stems.  I browned them in a pan with a little olive oil.  Then put in pot with the water to boil for about 10 minutes.  I removed stems and followed recipe.

I substituted water and chicken ingredients with 4 cups of  prepared chicken stock.  Left out the soy sauce.  Added one clove garlic and 1/2 tsp. ground fresh ginger.  I prebaked the asparagus with olive oil and butter.  Used that for the roux.  I loved this soup!

I followed the recipe, with the exception of the unhealthy margarine, (I used butter), and because I'm on a carb-free diet, I didn't use the potato. This soup was really good without them.

I will definitely make this again.  I used an immersion blender, but next time, I probably will just cut the asparagus into 1/2" pieces.  I love asparagus and would rather have little bites.

I misread the recipe and ended up using condensed cream of chicken instead of condensed chicken broth. :( I also had broccoli stem trimmings along with asparagus trimmings so I used them both. I didn't use quite as much bouillion, only 4 tsp instead of 4tbsp. I followed the rest of the recipe, using butter.

It all worked out, as I thought the soup was satisfying. It ended up looking more opaque than the photo on the recipe page, as the cream of chicken made it extra thick. I was surprised by the addition of the soy sauce in the recipe, but you really can't tell from the taste that it's in there, except perhaps for the added saltiness.

I will try the recipe with the condensed broth next time. Thank you for sharing!

Wow, what a great soup!  I don't usually make creamed soups but I had a lot of asparagus I had to use up.  I used cream of chicken soup because I didn't have the canned broth, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  I'll make this again.

Fantastic recipe. I also used butter instead of marg. I couldn't find bouillon powder so used 2 stock cubes instead. I used fresh young asparagus resulting in a beautiful mild flavoured soup. Served with freshly baked bread and butter it made for a very satisfying meal.

A mild tasting soup, added a dash of garlic powder. Only pureed half the batch so that there was pieces of asparagus in the soup.

It's really delicious and my kid really enjoyed eating the soup with me, which is always a plus. One problem I ran into was the celery threads wouldn't grind properly. But I'll definitely be making it again. So good!

It is AMAZING! My husband does not like soup and my dad doesn't like greens and they both LOVE this soup I am requested to make it often. I have made this recipe for over 6 years now and I still get rave reviews, even my kids, 8,6,3 and1 all eat it up!! (awesome!) I guess the only thing I do different is I only puree 1/2 soup that way you still have some veggies to chew but I do keep all the ingredients and measurements the same. Try it out, you'll love it!

I added thyme and cream of mushroom soup for my condense flavor and topped with a garnish lump crabmeat. I agree that 1tbs of bouillon was enough.

I love asparagus and this soup is my favorite. I've never had better. My hubby and 16-month old love it too. I've made it several times and usually follow the recipe exactly but I've also modified it by adding a little hot sauce for some kick and it's still excellent.

Loved this soup - quick and easy.  Used chicken broth instead of water/boullion, skipped the cream, and saved the asparagus tips to put in after pureeing.  Will definitely make this again.

Incredibly rich & Awesome flavor!

Her are our changes:

Real butter instead of margarine (must I explain?).
Used green onion stalks instead of a bulb.
Instead of condensed broth, used condensed golden mushroom soup.

Sauteed asparagus pieces in butter (yeah, again!) and folded them in at the end.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I served it to 8 people, and it was gone in minutes! What amazed me the most, was that you could taste every ingredient in the soup. I will definitely make this soup again!

Never made cream of asparagus soup before. Looked up the excellent basic recipe today to cook all afternoon in my crockpot. Added garlic - because who wouldn't include garlic? Added second potato. Doubled asparagus. When I returned home this evening I could smell the wonderfulness outdoors !  Rather than make a roux to thicken, used my hand blender to thicken it with blended soup ingredients.  Omitted half-and-half in recipe but stirred 1 cup sour cream into warm, blended soup before serving. It is a divine, luxurious, nourishing soup!

This is a great recipe. Very simple. Simple ingredients and easy to make. Wonderful flavor that every I have served this too has loved. I give this recipe five stars because not only have I made it over and over but have received requests for the recipe or folks remark about it later on!

SOOO Yummy. I've made it 4 times. Sometimes more chicken broth sometimes less, a little bit of bouillon powder to a little bit of water. It's just so easy and sooo tasty!

Omitted the soy sauce because this was plenty salty enough. Didn't have bouillon cubes so I used a little more stock and less water than indicated along with a few sprinkles of soul seasoning. Turned out absolutely delicious!

This is a favorite!  I use an immersion blender to 'cream' the soup just a bit (leaving pieces of potato and asparagus intact) and I use chicken broth instead of the bouillion and water.   Perfect topped with homemade croutons.

Fantastic soup!!  I had no onions so I used a leek instead.  While simmering, I found that the soup evaporated alot so I added 3 more cups of chicken broth.  I had no soya sauce or white pepper so I did not put that in the soup either.  I put milk instead of half-half cream.  It was still really good and very tasty.

I've never made an Aparagus soup, so this was a first try. I like to tweek toward the healthier side; so here was my attempt: I also used the advice from others and used 2T. olive oil and 2T. butter instead of "M" to saute' the celery and onions; I used 1 box(4c.) of organic chicken broth instead of the water, bouillon powder and can of chicken broth; exchanged 1T Bragg's Liquid Aminos for the Soy(tastes the same, just better for you). I canned Asparagus last spring, so used this and added it last and late in the process. I know it would probably be very wonderful with fresh, but it's winter in WI; I will try again in spring. I loved this base recipe to tinker with!

Fantastic.  Emersion blenders are great tools for making this type of soup creamy.  I always put my own touches on a dish, and this was no exception.  It is always helpful to have a great base recipe to help get it started and doesn't take away from my rating at all.

This soup was amazing! It didn't last long, even my 8 year old loved it. I did use an extra tablespoon of flour and used 1% milk instead of cream to reduce fat. The little extra flour and the potatoe made it really thick and creamy, I wasn't missing out at all without using the half and half cream!

Made this last night.  I'm pregnant and have no appetite--but this was great.   I made it through the entire bowl and I even brought some to work today and ate that.  Used a little less bouillon than called for and didn't puree it.  Delicious!

Awesome soup! I followed some of the other suggestions, and added 2 diced up chicken breasts to it. My 3 and 5 year olds cleaned their bowls! I will be making this again. I paired it with the "Tender Potato Rolls" recipe on here and they went perfect together.

Made it last night!  Only change I made was to use heavy cream instead of the half-and-half.  It was very good!

I doubled this recipe and it turned out excellent. I omitted the soy sauce because I didn't have any. This soup is excellent. Sure to become one of my family cold weather favourites.

Awesome recipe that even my kids enjoyed.  One change I made was I put 2 cans of chicken broth with 2 cups of water and then used 2 TB of chicken bouillon granules.  After pureeing the soup, it's a good idea to strain it to remove the stringy pieces that do not puree.  I also saved the tips and section close to the tips (cooked in the microwave) to add to the pureed soup to give it some texture.

Tasted very good, I added too much liquids to mine so it had more of a soup consistency then a cream but that's all right with me, just means more of a good thing!

Delish! Really good soup...I hummed and hawed about the puree thing, and in the end decided to do it, and I'm glad I did. It took no time at all in my blender, and the smooth texture is fantastic. I added minced garlic to simmer, 3 potatoes rather than just the one called for...and I thought that chicken broth AND chicken boullion was unneccessary, so I stuck with 5 cups water 5 tbsp boullion, and it worked out well. Not too salty, but I didn't add soya sauce either, which I think only adds more salt. Great creamy soup, I'll freeze some for the autumn months! Thanks for the post!

Awesome recipe. I pureed all the soup but there was still very small bites of asparagus that made it perfect. The potatoes with it was  wonderful and I used more than 1. My teenager took it to school the next day and my 6 year old took several bites but decided she didn't like it. Everyone else did and will make again. I might have to try growing some asparagus just for this recipe.

This is amazing soup! My daughter rated it 10/10. I made a couple of changes. I used leeks instead of onions, organic chicken stock (4 cups) and light cream. Absolutely delicious!!

Great recipe! My baby just discovered the world of crawling so you can imagine, I have little time to cook! This was a fast, easy, GREAT recipe. We are a salt family so we needed to add a little extra. Used whole milk instead of half n half because it was all we had. Will probably use it again. Soup turned out not to think but not to runny.

I've made this a couple of times but haven't had the nerve to add the soy sauce. I should try it when I'm not having company. Without something, the soup is a little bland.  This time, I sprinkled Chinese Five Spice on each bowl and added a few homemade croutons. Served as the first course for Christmas dinner.  All 10 bowls were practically scraped clean. (Couldn't find condensed chicken broth so I used condensed cream of chicken.)

This was excellent! Husband and I almost polished it off tonight.  I made a few changes, namely omitting the canned soup and just adding more water/bullion to compensate, sauteing garlic with the onion/celery, adding a bay leaf while the soup simmered, and leaving out the soy sauce.  I also used one full cup of non-dairy creamer to balance out the salty flavor from the bullion.  Next time I will scale back to 4 tsp. instead of tbsp.  But overall an excellent experiment in asparagus.  I will definitely make again and am planning to serve to company this weekend.  Also would be good as a broccoli soup.

5 stars+++!  Healthy and still creamy.  Don't leave out the lemon juice.  Suggestion is to make sure you puree thoroughly.  I have been looking for something healthy to eat and have made this about 8 times over the last year.  Fantastic just he way it is!

This is great! I've now made it 2 times - this time I reduced the chicken stock to 2Tbls and omitted the soy sauce, and it was perfect --- much less salty. I put in approx 1 Tbls garlic with the onion and celery, used 3 small potatoes, 5 C water with no chicken broth (the stock is all that's really needed)and subbed skim milk for the 1/2-n-1/2. I put it in the  blender to a beautiful creamy consistency. YUM!

GREAT RECIPE!! I CHANGED A FEW THINGS TO GET A MORE CREAMY SOUP. ONLY 1 STALK OF CELERY, ADDED 2 GARLIC CLOVES. INSTEAD OF WATER AND BULLION I USED 2 CUPS WATER & 2 CUPS OF CHICKEN BROTH PLUS 1 CAN OF BROTH. 5 SMALL POTATOES PEELED &. CUBED SMALL, INSTEAD OF PLAIN MILK I USED 2/3 C EVAPORATED MILK, 1 C HEAVY CREAM. THIS MAKES THE MOST AWESOME CREAMY SOUP. PERFECT FOR A TEA LUNCHEON. I'M QUITE SURE IT IS OFF THE CALORIE CHART.

I left out the potatoes but added chopped carrots for color. I mashed the vegies rather than pureeing them. Wished the soup was creamier (maybe the potato would have helped that) but flavor was great. Will try it again.

This was a hit for dinner! I did add 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic to the onions & celery. I did not have soy sauce, but I added 2 Tbs of fresh-squeezed lemon at the end. YUMM-O!!! SERVED IT WITH FRESH-BAKED HOME-MADE HONEY WHEAT BREAD!

Great Recipe.  A few variotions I made: I added minced garlic, and sauteed the onions and celery with two pieces of bacon. Great flavor.  Then, I spiced it up with some fresh cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious!

We all love this soup…even my 11 year old son! I’ve made it several times and it can turn out a little salty, so I just add a little less bouillon. I think the recipe is absolutely wonderful. Thanks William!

Perhaps I was overly optimistic based on the rave reviews of this recipe.Neither my husband nor I cared that much for it and thought we had prepared better asparagus soup than this. It was overly salty despite using reduced sodium broth and reducing the amount of bouillon. Definitely a disappointment. Will not fix again. Sorry

I loved this recipe, although I  did make a few slight adjustments.  I used butter instead of margerine.  I used 4 cups broth instead of water, chicken flavored salty cubes, and condensed broth.  I didn't have white pepper so I just used the black.  I also reserved all the tips and sauted them and placed them in the center of the soup bowls as a garnish, it looked so fine.

Excellent!  And easy.  I reserved the tops of the asparagus and steamed slightly then added them just before serving so that there were pieces of asparagus in the soup.  I forgot about the potato, not sure what one potato does anyway.  It seemed like a lot of pepper, but the flavor went well in the soup.  Thanks!

I don't like a lot of pepper in or on my food, so I found--even though in all 1/2 tsp. of pepper does not semm like a lot, it was too much for me. It seemed to over-power the soup and took away from the asparagus flavor, so next time I will cut back on the pepper. Other wise, enjoyed the soup.

This was the first time I have made asparagus soup and it was better than any I've had in a restaurant. I made without any changes except to make three servings instead of six. My wife loved this. Thanks Willam for a really good recipe.

This recipe was amazing.  I used extra potatoes and double the butter which probably made it extra fattening (but also extra good).  I have 6-7 pounds of asparagas left over from last year (vaccuum sealed in the freezer) and I will use every ounce of it making this over and over again...

It was just so bland.  Didn't really taste like anything. Very dissapointed. The recipe as is has no flavor and nobody in my family liked it.

Excellent soup, as most of the other posts have said.  I did alter it a bit, cut back on the amount of chicken bouillon, used less water and added one cup of milk.  Couldn't wish for anything better.  YUM, YUM.

A very good soup.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some frozen asparagus and this was perfect.  I can't wait to try it with fresh ingredients.  It was a little salty so next time I'll use a bit less bullion.

Excellent!!! I chose this cream of asparagus recipe to try because it was the lowest in calories and fat with great reviews and now I know why.  I followed it exactly except for no soy sauce, half the amount of cream, and used only white pepper. My entire family loved it as well and it was a hit at a recent luncheon. Thanks for such a great recipe! I'll be making this one for many years to come.

Absolutely delish!

I agree...4 teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder.  

Everyone is right, it doesn't NEED the 1/2 and 1/2 but adding it makes it SO good ;)

I'm going to try to use this as a basis for a homemade cream of tomato soup.  Mmmmmm!

I decided to be brave and try this xmas eve for the first time.  It was fairly easy to make and everyone (even all my 4 children, some who won't touch asparagus) ate every last bite.  Needs a little more salt, but I left as is and let my guests add if they wanted.  Good recipe, will make again for sure.

I am so glad that I read the reviews and didn't add the abundant amount of chicken bouillon (scaled it down to teaspoons) as called for in the recipe.  I used my hand blender for extra ease in blending the mixture at the end, but left some chunky bits of asparagus for more texture.  Thanks William!  This is a keeper in my soup file.

One of the best soups I've EVER had--in a restaurant or otherwise.  My wife *and* son both gave this one two thumbs up.  I made a double batch for only three of us and my son ask me why I only made "a little bit."  We just left it on the stove and it was gone in less than 24 hours.  I did not do the blending thing.  I prefer the extra substance of having chunks in my soup.  Typically, I prefer soup that is thicker.  This one turned out thinner than I expected, but it was fabulous nonetheless.

Very good and relatively easy to make.  I cut the salty products that were in this receipe (due to what I read in other reviews)and my husband thinks it needs more salt.  I only used 2 cubes of chicken boullion, so maybe it could use 3 or the called for, 4.  I served this with a loaf of Roasted Garlic French Bread.  We will definately make this one again.  Thanks William!!

I did not find this to be all I expected it to be. Two of our four children liked it (our five year old had thirds), and my husband liked it. I found it to have a heavy chicken flavor even after noting other reviews and trimming way back on the chicken bouillon. Our home gives it a 50/50 rating.

Very yummy! Just like a restaurant's in California that I used to eat at all the time when I lived there and now that I don't live there I crave it, so this satisfied my craving :) ! I didn't add the bouillon (I think that makes things too salty) or the potato & didn't have half & half so I just used a little bit of milk, it was creamy enough anyway without using too much. Very, very good! I will be making again!

This soup was extremely salty!  And this is coming from someone who generally likes salty foods.  I even used low-sodium soy sauce.  I did scale it down from 6 servings to 2, so maybe my measuring was off.  I may try again, possibly omitting the boullion powder.

I enjoyed this soup, although it was a little to salty for me too.  I also used half and half olive oil and butter instead of margarine.  Next time I will cut back on the boullion amount.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great flavor. I bought an extra pound of asparagus, one small potato,and added to the soup to make it a little chunky. Wonderful with crusty Italian or French bread. Very excellent flavor.

The best!  I used butter/olive oil, fresh chicken stock (omitting the bullion powder) - after I finished pureeing it in the blender, I didn't even need to add the cream!  Very and clean tasting soup - save some tiny spear tips to garnish on top.  Try this, you will love it!

A most delicious soup. Serve it with a loaf of french bread, you'll need it to clean the bowl with!

I made this with leftover asparagus (the tips were used for another recipe), and it was great!  We used mocha mix because we could not have dairy, and it worked just fine!

This is a great soup.  Easy to make and really tasty on a chilly day.  Reserve a few of cooked asparagus spears to garnish for a great presentation.

This turned out to be a soup that I was serving as an apetizer and I had so many bowls of it that I could hardly eat the entree! Really good recipe and fairly easy to make. A good recipe to consider for cold winter days.

I did find it a bit salty and will probably back off the bullion a bit when I make it again, but the rest of my dining guests found it to be just perfect.

Excellent recipe!  I used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter instead of margarine.  Cooked and pureed the soup in the morning.  Before serving for dinner, I added fat free half & half, soy, and the ground peppers.  It's a winner.

VERY VERY GOOD!  We are not a big fan of asparagus so I was leery - boy am I glad we tried it!  It is salty so next time I'll use low sodium chicken broth - no way would I take anything out! We had a crusty bread that was just perfect with it!

I am a newlywed and I am really into trying new recipes and let me tell you this was a hit! It was easy to prepare and my husband loved it. I think that next time I would omit the cream, I found after it was pureed it had a great creamy texture. A crusty bread goes well with this soup.

My husband and I never have soups, and he doesn't even like asparagus, but we both loved this asparagus soup recipe.  We didn't puree the soup because we didn't have a blender or food processor, and it still turned out just great.  We added mushrooms as well.  Just delicious!

What an awesome soup!! It was just a bit salty for my taste, so next time I will not add as much of the bouillon powder; and I did use a light soy sauce. But this was really wonderful!

I picked the right cream of asparagus soup when I chose this one.  It was so delicious, I used 1/4 cup of heavy cream instead of half and half and I also used butter instead of margarine.
