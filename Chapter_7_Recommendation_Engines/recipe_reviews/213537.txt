I used leftover mac n cheese from Easter dinner. The only change i made was using the Campbells fiesta cheese soup instead of the cream of mushroom and it was delish!

"The best macaroni and cheese ever!" is what my kids told me. It's easy, and tasty. I mixed in broccoli for some veggies and it was great. I would try other veggies like corn as well.

This is great! I made some modifications.  I used cream of chicken (don't like cream of mushroom), 4 cups of cheese, a whole 16 oz jar of Ortega Salsa, box of small shells, and 8 oz cream cheese.  I wouldn't put the chips on top again though, we didn't like it.  It was very cheesey and creamy! This is going to be added to my favorite recipe collect.

It was good.  Got thrown off by the can size for the mushroom soup, the recipe calls for a large can (26 oz) vs. the 10 oz can that I had in the cupboard, so I halfed the ingredients and it was perfect for the 2 of us.

Very Good- I added a pound of hamburger because I knew my boys would be angry with no meat! I added an extra cup of noodles too. AMAZING!

The cream of mushroom soup was too overpowering for us.  I think the ratio vs the salsa needs to be increased.  I used Monterey Jack and it didn't melt enough for us.  It was kinda chunky and grainy.  It was edible, but we won't be making it again.

Pretty good dish. Not the most fantastic thing I've ever tasted, but I do love the fact that it's quick, cheap and easy. It is in my weekly rotation for those reasons alone, but we get board of it. I add more pasta to make it hearty. If you make it the way it's written it's a little too watery, but more macaroni = delish. :)

This was great -- and really easy!  3 cups of pasta is roughly 1/2 box so I made double and froze half of it.  Will be making again!

A pretty decent version of mac and cheese. I used about 20 ounces of the soup (fat-free, and only because I had bought two smaller cans instead of the one, large can) and reduced the milk and salsa to about 3/4 each. I put in around 4-5 cups of pasta (I like a lot of pasta!), and only about 2 cups of cheese because I ran out. Next time I will definitely add in 3-4 since I couldn't really taste the cheese this time. Everything came out bubbly and creamy, and the dish had a nice tang to it. It also smelled really good in the oven. I'll make this again, as it's quick and easy and great for a chilly day.

I didn't like this dish simply because it wasn't cheesy enough for my tastes. Simple, bland, unflavorful recipe. I will not be making it again.

Made exactly as directed. My son hated it, but my husband and I thought it was OK.
