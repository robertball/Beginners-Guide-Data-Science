I've made this recipe many times and it is great!  I altered it a little by adding 2 sliced yellow onions and 2 cloves of sliced garlic.  I mix the potatoes, onions and garlic in a large bowl with the olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper and fresh rosemary.  Then I line a roasting pan with foil, spray it with Pam and dump the potatoes in the roasting pan.  After 30 minutes I sprinkle, grated Romano cheese over the potatoes and leave in the oven for 5-10 minutes.  These are superb!!!

I used only olive oil and some cooking spray for a low fat option.  I also cooked it 30 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered for a more roasted taste   - Awesome!

Easy, fast and delicious. These potatoes go great with just about anything. I lined my roasting pan with tin foil so clean-up was a snap.

I changed this recipe a bit, I used 16-18 baby red potatoes, using a vegetable peeler, remove a narrow strip of peel from around the middle of each potato.  I cooked the potatoes in boiling salted water until just tender (about 13 minutes)  Drained.  Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add potatoes, and fresh rosemary, saute until crisp and golden.(about 7 minutes)  Smells wonderful, and very tasty.

Very good! This is a mainstay when I serve filet mignon. It is very quick and easy to make. Use olive oil instead of the butter and vegetable oil and place all ingredients in a plastic ziplock bag so everything gets thoroughly coated; also quarter the potatoes. Yum!

A very easy and tasty dish!  I used olive oil in place of the oil and butter and added some chopped thyme and parsley too for added flavor.

Delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and used half a package of small red potatoes cut into wedges.  I used olive oil instead of veg. oil and 1 tsp. of dried rosemary.  I sprayed the bottom of an 8x8 pan with Pam and baked these uncovered at 425 for 35 minutes turning once during cooking.  They had a great flavor.

These were great!  We used fresh rosemary from my new rosemary plant.  I would even add more next time.  Used a mix of red, yellow, and purple potatoes.  Baked at 400 degrees for a shorter amount of time because I was making Baked Chicken Nuggets at the same time.

This is obviously a very simple and elegant recipe. I gave it three out of five stars because the butter is very unnecessary and three TBS is a lot of oil. For people who don't want the added fat, just using olive oil still gives the potatoes so much flavor. Also, I only used two tablespoons of olive oil and that was more than enough. Still healthy and a perfect side to any gourmet meal.

I love this dish, and have made it before I found it on this website.  A few things I do differently: I boil the potato chunks for 10-15 minutes, then drain. Preheat the oven to 375, and put the potatoes on a baking sheet.  Drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle with rosemary, garlic powder, basil, and oregano.  I like to add a little lemon juice also when serving alongside chicken, fish, or a light pork dish. It lightens the flavors a lot. Also, a thinly sliced lemon, sprinkled with herbs and baked with the potatoes adds a really nice and elegant touch to the presentation.  Bake for 35 minutes, until lightly browned on the outside. and tender inside.

Using a mix of butter and olive oil, hubs made individual portions for us tonight in cast iron mini cocottes. This made for a lovely, golden exterior, while the insides of the unpeeled, baby Yukon Golds he used were tender and creamy. Rosemary is always an excellent accompaniment to any potato dish as it was here as well. Simple, beautiful and delicious.

Good taters!  I microwaved whole reds first (1 min for small - 2 min for large) then coated and baked at 425 (to accomodate the other dish I was preparing) for 30 min. Very good!

I must be the minority on this one....I do think that the taste of rosemary was way to pungent and other than that....bland.  I won't be using this one again...sorry.  Thanks for the post anyway.

Very simple recipe and great side dish. Although, I mix everything in a bowl instead first and then dump it all on the pan. Not sure if it makes a difference but it was much easier and cleaner.

These potatoes have a lot of potential: just cut down on the oil & butter significantly.  I used 1T of each & they were still more greasy than necessary.  But the flavor & ease of thise dish are great with that one modification.  I'll make them again, but definitely with way less butter & oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great super easy way to make red potatoes.  I used just enough olive oil to coat the potatoes and then mixed in the salt, peper and rosemary.  They were great.

I have made these potatoes twice now, and I seriously doubt I will ever use another recipe for roasted red potatoes!  The first time I made them, I prepared the recipe as written, using a ziploc bag to mix it all up rather than a bowl and lining the pan with foil, as suggested by several other reviewers.  This time, I used the same technique, but used olive oil in place of vegetable oil (still used the butter too!), and added some fresh parsley and chives from our garden to the mixture along with the rosemary, salt, and pepper.  Oh my goodness, they turned out sooooo good!  Served with steaks and a salad, and these were the perfect finishing touch to our meal.  Thank you for sharing!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These are awesome, but way to much butter and oil.  I think 1 tablespoon of each would be plenty.  I used olive oil, fresh rosemary and about 1 tsp. kosher salt and 1/2 tsp. fresh ground black pepper.  It's tempting to want to add garlic, but it's really wonderful the way it is!

Follow the recipe to a letter, and you get bland, undercooked potatoes. It took an hour to get fork tender in my oven. Three stars for the premise, but, with a few changes, it was a five-star side. I followed advice and substituted olive oil for the regular. I also added 1 tablespoon- yes, a full tablespoon- of garlic salt and a teaspoon of onion powder. These little additions meant the difference between an unremarkable side dish, and one we will make many times.

I used dried rosemary and regular potatoes and these were great. However, I like my potatoes to be crisp and browned so I ended up taking off the foil and cooking them for over an hour to get the crispness I wanted. Next time I may try broiling at the end so I won't have to leave them in for as long.

Tasty.  These took about 40 minutes to cook at 450 degrees for us.  I used olive oil (about 4 tablespoons total) rather than the butter/oil combination.

This recipe wasn't all that I had hoped.  It was a good start, but it definitely needed a lot more rosemary in my opinion. After I made some changes (added garlic, poultry seasoning, and LOTS of pulverized rosemary) it was quite good, but prior to that, it was terribly bland.

Made this before, and it is a very nice addition to a steak dinner, among others.  I make it by slicing potatoes on my mandolin (cheap ones to be found, made of plastic). Slice about 1/4 inch thick, and also added yellow onion. I left out the butter to make it cholesterol-free, and eased back on the oil. I also switched out veggie oil, for a good, extra virgin olive oil. Put it all into a pouch, made from aluminum foil, and toss on grill, with steaks. You flip the steaks, you flip the pouch. Perfect every time!

I loved this dish. I made it as stated except I used EVOO (thank you Linda McLean and MandySue) and I kicked the oven up to 450, because I like to really roast my vegetables. About mid-way through the cooking process I stirred the potatoes and put the tray on the bottom oven rack. Next time I will use more fresh rosemary. The potatoes had a slight crispiness to the outside and were tender inside. I love the combination of butter (please use real butter) and EVOO. Thank you Bellarouge--this recipe is in my 5-star Recipe Box!

I added 10 minutes to the baking time and added garlic and these potatoes came out wonderfully!!  I tried the recipe again, lowering the oven to 350 degrees (I was baking meatloaf at the same time), adding a half hour to the baking time (for a total of one hour), and adding cut up asparagus during the last 20 minutes of baking.  Also came out wonderfully!!

HEAVENLY!!!!  They're greasy, but very flavorful! I threw a DASH of garlic salt over mine as well as the rosemary.  These were fantastic and I will make them again for sure!  Mine took close to an hour to cook, but luckily I planned my meal around that after reading the reviews...Thanks for the recipe!!

I omitted the butter and just covered the potatoes with olive oil.  I added lots of fresh garlic.  I loved the potatoes.

I did not care for this recipe. It had no flavor. I couldn't even serve them I resorted to boxed mac and cheese instead. I even tried to add garlic butter. try the honey roasted red potato recipe way better and still simple

I left the rosemary out because I was planning on having these under the 'Chicken Breasts in Caper Cream Sauce' recipe from this site. I figured the rosemary would change the flavor of the dish. It was delicious! I can't wait to try it with the rosemary another time!!

Roasted anything with rosemary-how can you go wrong?  So good and easy.  I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and a sprinkle of cajun seasoning.

They were very good, but didn't blow me away.  If it weren't for the rosemary there wouldn't be much flavor.  And even though the potatoes were cut into small chunks, they needed much more cooking time (close to an hour's worth).  I would make again as a more simple side dish.

I did half with dried rosemary and the other half with fresh rosemary.  I liked it a lot better with the fresh but I will add more than 1T next time as it needed a little extra.  Also, I microwaved the potatoes for a few minutes to lessen the cooking time.

These were great. I cut the recipe in half, used the same amount of rosemary, used olive oil instead of vegetable, and added one minced garlic clove. I baked them covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 20 minutes. I will be making these often. I would have given 5 stars but I added more flaver to the recipe.

Yummy!Easy! Add garlic if you like. (2 TBSP minced) To keep sodium down we used unsalted butter. Mix it all up in a gallon ziploc bag. Perfect.

Not good. Edible, but the rosemary was too strong. That was all I could smell in the house! I like the idea though, and may try this replacing the rosemary with garlic.

I wanted to make this as a side dish tonight, but didn't have any red potatoes. I decided to go ahead and make them with regular potatoes, and I added some baby carrots (sliced lengthwise), and a clove of minced garlic. It turned out really good. I love the rosemary flavor! And the kitchen smells wonderful when it's cooking. I'm looking forward trying it with the red potatoes!

I cook with rosemary alot because I love the flavor. I make these potatoes but I use olive oil instead of butter and vegetable oil and bake uncovered about 45 minutes, that way the potatoes get nice and crisp.

These were really good -- made my kitchen smell great! A few changes I made: I used EVOO instead of canola oil, which I think made a huge difference in the crispiness of the potatoes. I also added some oregano in with the rosemary which tasted great. Will make this recipe again!

These were very good...I followed the recipe with just a couple of changes.  I mixed everything together in a large bowl, stirred everything together, then put in the baking dish.  I also added extra fresh  rosemary.  When they were done, they were pale and very soft.  I took the foil off and browned them under the broiler to crisp them up a little.  They turned out very well, and they were so simple to make.  I served them with the Baked Salmon Filets Dijon (from this site...delish!) and steamed spinach.

I love this one too! One suggestion, if you like your potatoes a bit crispy, turn onto broil for the last 5-10 minutes, and they crisp up great. I had minced garlic (the kind you can buy in the big jars at Costco) and this recipe takes me 5 minutes to prepare! YUM

These are the best!! I used Olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.  You need to cook them a bit longer than the recipe notes.  The rosemary defintely adds great flavor.  I have made these over and over again. One of my favorites. Thanks!

I made this as a side dish to Alaskan King Crab legs and it was a hit.  My boyfriend claimed it was the best potato dish he has ever had.  I doubled the rosemary, and added a tiny bit more at the end of cooking for added color.

This recipe was pretty good, but there were some minor changes that we made. I put the potatoes on a baking sheet n the oven at 400 degrees for browner, crisper potatoes. Also, We found that about 2 and a half tsp.'s of salt is a pretty good amount. Enjoy!

Love these! I usually have to cook longer (like 45 min) in order for these to get kind of crusty like I like them. I use olive oil instead of vegetable, and the amount of oil and butter is enough to do twice or three times the amount of potatoes called for (in my opinion). I often use dried italian herbs instead of the rosemary if I don't have any and it's really good!

These were very delicious! A little greasy for my liking so next time I will cut back on the butter/oil. But very basic, easy and great flavor! I did have to bake much longer than it said so not sure about that.

I would make these again.  Easy and flavorful.  The cooking time was appropriate for me, but I did cut the potatoes into smaller wedges (about bite-sized).  I thought there was too much of the butter/oil combination and will use less next time.

These were really yummy. I used olive oil, no butter. I put them in a zip lock bag with the flavored oil and tossed. I covered them for 20 minutes, then uncovered for another 10. They were perfect.

This was my first time making red potatoes, and they came out great.  Probably just because I'm pregnant, I added sliced mushrooms to them.  I ate almost all of them by myself.

These were good; the rosemary was a bit subtle andI felt needed a bit more spices to jazz them up.  I didn't like the soft texture.  I even stuck them under the broiler but they didn't crisp up very well.  I think I'll go back to my usual potatoes.

We love this recipe!  I halve the amount of butter/oil (so 3T total) & pour the herbs, salt & pepper right into the butter/oil in a bowl.  I put the potatoes on top, stir & put in a foil-lined pan.  Bake @ 425 for 40 minutes! Yum :)

The aroma will bring in "customers" faster than any dinner bell!  I made mine on top of the stove as it is over 90 outside and didn't want to heat up the kitchen!  Sliced them 1/4" thick and cook in boiling water for abt. 20 min.  Drain thoroughly.  Melted 2 Tbsp. of butter and added a crushed garlic clove until cooked.  Add the sliced potatoes, finely chopped rosemary (abt. 2 sprigs) and some chicken broth.  (Start w/ 1/2 c. and "eyeball" it.)  You just want it to be nice and moist.  S & P to taste.  Wonderful!

Instead of butter and veg oil I generously coat with EVOO and a little crushed garlic. Now and then, instead of just rosemary, will use Herbs de Provence.  We've made at home and is also an easy camping side, roasted in foil over a grill (indirect heat). YUM!!!

Tasty, but had to cook for an extra 30 minutes! I used dried rosemary instead of fresh. About 1 Tbsp of dries rosemary. I also replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil. For a little more flaovor next time I think I will add 2 Tbsp minced garlic.

I made quite a few changes to these and they came out quite good.  I cut the potatoes into slices rather than wedges, spread them out in rows on a cookie sheet, and drizzled them with olive oil only.  Then, as suggested by other reviewers, I sprinkled liberal amounts of garlic and dried rosemary, thyme, and oregano over the tops.  This was a great side.  Thanks!

I absolutely love this recipe. It does seem to take a little longer to cook, probably because  I don't bother covering them.  I do add a bit of fresh thyme and granulated garlic as well. Thanks, Bellarouge!

these were really good and really easy.  mine cooked in 30 min no problem.  but I would take the foil off the last five minutes next time so they're a little darker and crispy.  excellent recipe!

Loved this recipe.  I did add Dill and Garlic to the mixture.  I used Olive Oil in place of the vegetable oil.  Also, I let the butter, oil, Rosemary, Dill, and Garlic simmer in a saucepan while cutting the potatoes until I was done and ready to pour the mixture over the potatoes

Perfect recipe,perfect side dish! Was very simple to make. I also added fresh garlic and more butter. I didn't add as much rosemary.The first time I made this recipe the rosemary over powered the potatoes. I also uncovered the potatoes for the last 5-10mins of the baking duration. My fiance loves these potatoes ...Thanks :)

Great recipe! I didn't vary the ingredients (with exception to olive oil instead of vegetable oil), the time said 30 minutes or more, so I kept them in for about 45 minutes, stirring every 10-15 minutes.  Just a note, I HAVE done a recipe very similar to this one that had you boil, then pan fry the potatoes.  There is a difference in the texture of final product, but both are equally good.  This one is a keeper:).

I love this recipe.  A friend made it for us and I had to make it myself.  I used white potatoes and it turned out great.  Also, I added some chopped garlic cloves to the mixture and I used garlic olive oil.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a very good recipe.  A tip for people using dried rosemary and not fresh rosemary - use less than the recipe calls for.  Use about half a tablespoon instead of a whole tablespoon.

Instead of baking these, I boiled the potato wedges for 10-15 minutes, then moved them to a skillet at medium high heat with just the oil and butter.  Let them get browned there for about twenty minutes, then add the garlic and rosemary and salt.  Cook for about another five minutes and it should come out great.  It's also slightly faster than baking.  I made it this way tonight and everyone loved it and went back for seconds.

very good! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and instead of plain table salt, I used a wonderful product called "Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up salt". It's the most delicious seasoned salt ive ever had! I am a big advocate of using seasoned salt in place of regular salt, as it adds so much more flavor.

I thought these potatoes could have used a bit more flavor.  I added fresh chives and wrapped them in foil and cooked them on the grill.  They were good, but not great.

This was a very good sidedish.  I tossed the potatoes with the butter and oil in a ziploc bag prior to placing them in the dish.  I think this coated them more evenly.  Would definitely make again!

This was so easy to make & it tasted excellent! I cut the red potatoes into smaller chunks so they would cook faster. I also added some minced garlic & season salt! Yummy! When I make this again, I will decrease the amount of oil. It was a bit greasy. I think this dish would taste great with fresh dill!

Delicious!!  I baked them longer, too, but I think it depends on how you like your potatoes.  I like mine soft.  My husband ate the leftovers for breakfast and thought they tasted better the next day!

Too bland for my taste.  Need more spices.  I cooked them 15 minutes longer because they were still crunchy.

Delicioso!!!  Yummmmy and super easy to make.  Takes some time in the oven though.  I think it could use a bit more salt and a little less oil/butter.  Careful not to add too much rosemary, it could kill it.

Good potatoes, but be very careful with the rosemary as it is easy to go overboard.  But a plus to any menu.

I rarely give a recipe 5 stars but this one earned every single one!  These are the best potato wedges I have ever had.  I stuck to the recipe except that I sprinkled some italian seasoning and baked them covered for 35 mins and them broiled them uncovered for 10 mins to crisp them up.  OUTSTANDING!  Will be making these often.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

I made this recipe for a brunch and it turned out well, it does seem to take closer to an hour cooked in a standard oven. I cut the potatoes much smaller than suggested so they were easier to eat, added salt and pepper. It was baked in an 8x8 pan for an hour to reach almost done (it was for the next morning). While the potatoes were still hot I stirred them, added more salt and pepper and an additional 1/2 tsp of rosemary before refrigerating - the flavors really got a chance to sink in! Popped them in the oven for about 30 min in the morning and they came out perfect.

Good potatoes...I added a couple cloves of minced garlic and only used 1 tbls. of smart balance butter, about 4 tbls. of evoo and fresh rosemary from my garden.  I cooked for about 40 min. with the foil on and 20  with it off so they would crisp up.  Thanks Bellarouge - we enjoyed your recipe.

I made these potatoes to go alongside my lamb chops.  They tasted very nice, although I did have to cook them for about 10 minutes longer.  I would make these again.

This recipe is excellent.  I've tried making it up on my own but didn't know how long to cook it for.  This recipe actually takes closer to 45 minutes.  I cover it with foil until the last 15 minutes, and then add grated parmesan in the last 5 minutes for a yummy crunchy crust that's also beautiful.  A fun twist is to add whole cloves of garlic to the potatoes before cooking.  They impart a yummy mild flavor while roasting right alongside the potatoes.  I also like to add a little thyme and sage.  Mmmmm.

Great base recipe! Here's my twist on it: In heavy-duty foil, I put in all ingredients as per the recipe. (I used fresh rosemay & baby reds.) I did add a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash's seasoning, but just a dash! ;) Folded the whole thing up and threw it on the (gas) grill.  I served this with London Broil, also cooked on the grill during the last 15 mins. (I love the taste of rosemary with beef, so the two are a natural pairing, IMO.) I suppose you could par-boil the potatoes to cut the grill time, but I haven't tried that yet. 
Side by side on a patter with the sliced beef & rosemary garnish, this is a casually elegant meal that goes over well.

Fantastic!  They are as good as they are simple!  I lined my pan with foil as to avoid clean-up and used freshly grated pepper and salt.  I ended up adding a little more s&p at the end once ?I gave an initial taste test.  I sliced my potatoes thinly which cut down on baking time considerably.

These potatoes go with so many things!  My only changes is I add 1 clove minced garlic and use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I do find I need to cook them longer than 30 minutes, usually 40-45 minutes.  I also recommend either using a non-stick roasting pan or line it with foil.

Delicious.  I cooked them at 350 for an hour like another reviewer did while I was cooking meatloaf.  I also used olive oil instead of veg oil.  They came out very tender and flavorful.  I used FRESH rosemary....YUMMY!

Half an hour is not long enough for these potatoes. They came out a little bit hard, but still pretty good.

This took longer to bake than I expected.  Eventually, I increased the oven temp to 425 and took off the aluminum foil to allow for browning. I added a generous clove of garlic, too.  This is a tasty side dish that is quick and easy to prepare.

Good recipe, but entirely too much oil used in it!  Even my husband, who loves everything greasy complained the potatoes were swimming in oil.  Cut the oil and butter by at least half and it is a really good recipe.

Very good!  Definitely could have used less butter/oil as others have suggested.  I used 1/2 tablespoon of dried rosemary and the hubby said to use even less next time, but I thought it was delicious as was.  Cooked at 375 for approximately 45 minutes (they were still a tad hard at 30 minutes).

I followed advise from a reviewer to make this recipe by first boiling the potatoes, then cooking them in a skillet. My oven was occupied, so I thought I'd try this method. I do not recommend it. When I combined the oil/butter and potatoes in the skillet, the potatoes were practically swimming in grease. I drained the pan several times throughout the cooking process and they turned out OK. My husband liked them, but he is a fan of fatty, buttery foods. I thought they were a bit much. If I made it again, I'd cut the oil/butter by at least half. I'd also add ALOT of spices as the end result is a bit bland.

The key to these is definitely fresh rosemary. I also minced three large cloves of garlic because I think the two flavors are awesome together.

A very good recipe.  Very easy to make.  I used dried rosemary, which worked just fine.  In order for it to be baked in 30 minutes, make sure your wedges are small.  Chop the potatoes into 6ths instead of 4ths.

Very quick and easy!  Next time I would use about half of the butter and vegetable oil, since I prefer them with more of a crisp to them.  Like another reader suggested...I would broil them towards the end.  I only had dried rosemary on hand, but it still had wonderful flavor.

yum, these potatoes are delicious!  i used olive oil and margarine (heart-healthy, no trans fatty acids) instead of butter and veg oil, and they were absolutely delicious.  also, i couldn't find fresh rosemary so i used dried.  too bad i had to share them with my boyfriend. :/

This was very good.  However, it took me 1 1/2 to cook the potatoes.  And you have to be careful that it doesn't burn.  But overall, nice flavor and texture.

This was a great recipe!  It tasted good, was easy to make and looked great!  My husband doesn't like rosemary so I substituted fresh basil - they tasted wonderful!  I also boiled them until just barely tender and then fried them on the stove.  Much quicker and they tasted great!  Try 'em!  You'll love 'em!

This recipe is great! The spices are good. I melted the butter and oil and instead of pouring it in the plate I put the pototoe's in the pan to cover them. then after they were all covered I poured the remainder of the oil/butter over them. If you cut your pototoe's fairly small they should cook in 30-40 minutes (I don't know why they would ever take 90 minutes!!!)My kids loved them and they were great the next day! enjoy!

Have made his a few times and each time it's so good and simple to make. Of course you can adjust the amounts to your taste after you've tried it once and know how the flavors work together but even following the recipe it's great. i think this recipe will even work if you throw in other vegetables that are about to spoil. These are my now go to potatoes! Thanks for the post.

Very tasty, and easy, too.  I used 2 potatoes, 2 Tbls butter, 2 Tbls olive oil, and a big sprig of Rosemary.  Baked in an 8 inch square dish.  It was just right for two people.  I didn't stir, I just placed the wedge in the butter mixture on it's side, turned it over so both cut sides were coated.  Then I sprinkled on the salt, pepper, and rosemary.  I didn't stir during baking, either, so they came out looking pretty.  I'm not crazy about potatoes, but these were good.

So much butter and oil! These didn't wow me but I suppose it really depends on what you're serving them with. If you have something else with stronger flavors these are a nice side, but for me I wanted a bit more flavor. I ended up adding more rosemary and I'm tempted to try some garlic or something else next time too. I'm also more of a crispy potato person too so I'd make them crispier next time. Overall, not bad but not amazing.

This was praised by everyone at my mom's birthday dinner last night. Turned out just right- crispy but tender inside, and a wonderful taste from the rosemary. I did follow the advice of some of the reviewers and used just enough olive oil to coat the potatoes, and baked it with foil on for the first 25 minutes and then foil off for an additional 20 (it took about 45 minutes to fully cook in my oven). Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have fresh rosemary, so did use the dried kind. I also sprinkled with garlic powder in addition to the other items. I baked for 30 minutes covered in foil, uncovered & sprinkled with Parmesan cheese & baked for another 15 minutes. Served with Ribeye steaks & a salad. Really good & easy to make.

Pungent guy !  Try Dill !Good on red taters also.... Use it on baked potatoes after microwaving ( set for 1 more potato than you cook, 3 pots. set for 4 ) wrap in foil after rubbing with butter , salt and dill. Seal tight and put on grill, turning twice while grilling steak. AWSOME ! Add spinach salad w/ Olive oil, red wine vinegar, little sugar, salt, pepper, sour cream,little mustard mixed and aged. AWSOMNER !

these were good, especially for breakfast- my 18 month old loved them.  I used a bit too much rosemary but it all depends on your taste.

This recipe is good in the microwave as well.  Just prepare as directed and microwave for about 15 minutes depending on the size of your potatoes.  Delicious!  Made it twice in one week.

Love this recipe! I like my roasted potatoes softer so I cook them for about 60 minutes. I also added a little extra butter to account for the longer cook time drying the potatoes out a little more, plus I like the added flavor. Add extra salt after you pull out of the over... to taste! Adding some minced garlic is also a nice option.

These potatoes were delicious!!  I used Canola oil instead of vegetable oil and added a very small amount of garlic powder, maybe 1 tsp.  We had them with grilled steak.

Delicious! The only adaptation I will make next time is cutting down on the oil and butter. I think 1 tablespoon of each is fine. Also, up the temp to 425 and they will cook in 30 minutes with a nice roasted flavor. YUM!

I had some fresh asparagus that I needed to use, so I did and the veggies were delicious!  I used another's suggestion and put everything into a plastic bag to mix and coat and it worked great. . .no mess!!  Also, I have let fresh herbs intimidate me (really?!?!?) because I wasn't sure if I would be using them correctly. I took the plunge and used fresh rosemary and I didn't wreck anything!!  Woohoo!  It was yummy!!

So simple and, yet, so delicious. I think I will use a little less butter and oil next time, just because I don't think it needed quite so much, but other than than, I will do this recipe often just as it is.

Substitute olive oil, a good fat, in place of the butter and veg oil.  Results are about the same but you're avoiding cholesterol and adding good fat.

I tossed in bag with olive oil, some garlic, and Italian seasoning, dry dill, plus salt and pepper. I dotted some butter on top of the potatoes before putting in oven. I had to bake for 45 minutes, broiling the last 5 minutes. 30 minutes wasn't enough. They were great with pork chops.

Very tasty but can become easily overwhelmed by the butter and oil. I recommend cutting back on them a bit as the dish turned ou a bit greasy.

I feel bad giving this recipe only one star, but it was VERY bland. Even after I doubled the spices like other reviewer's suggested. My potatoes didn't cook in the 30 minute time also. Too much rosemary for me, smelled like a car air freshner in the oven. Maybe if you added some cheese and olive oil instead of veg oil, it would taste better.

Great recipe! You don't have to change anything. In just 40min. I have a great side dish enjoyed by everyone. The only thing I have to add, is that I always put fresh rosemary from my garden!

Have also made these on the grill. I like to coat the potatoes with some bacon grease instead of the oil and butter...a little fattier alteration, but so fab! I love rosemary with potatoes...you can't go wrong.

Did take a lot longer to cook than it said, about an hour and could probably use 15 more minutes to have all the potatoes tender, but was pressed for time.  I used a combination of olive oil and butter.  Amazing vegetarian dish!

These were really great! It took about 45 min. to cook uncovered, but they came out well. I mixed fresh rosemary, a bit of thyme, a 1/4 tsp os salt and a bit of pepper in a bowl. I used olive oil only, and mixed in 4 cloves of minced garlic with the oil. I sprinkled the spices on the potatoes, but not enough got on, so I just mixed it all in the pan. I stirred them half way as well.

I have used this recipe so many times over the years. I do find that fresh rosemary is best, but is strong and needs a little less than the recipe asks for. Dried rosemary works just as great, too. 
I use more EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) than butter and chop my potatoes in smaller, bite-sized cubes for faster cooking.

Good however I would either cut down a bit on the rosemary or use dried. That much fresh rosemary was way too overpowering for my taste. Will make again with a few tweaks.

Very easy recipe to make.  It did take quite a bit longer to get the desired consistency of the potatoes, but it was worth the wait.  They were a big success at my Halloween Party!  Might use a little more oil and a little less "butter" next time...

I chose to replace the vegetable oil with Italian olive oil (dipping oil) and I added one teaspoon of garlic powder and also added carrots. It was very good. My son said the house smelled like Christmas!

I kept the potatoes baking for an extra 45 min or so so that they would absorb more flavor, and cook more. For the last half hour I removed the aluminum foil so that they would develop a crispness. I also added some garlic powder salt and pepper. They were really good.

These are good potatoes-I had to cut back some on the rosemary.  Added garlic salt and pepper and were great.  Like someone else, you could really cut the butter/oil mixture in half and they would still be fine.

These potatoes were okay. The flavours were quite good, if un-special (well, rosemary potatoes... what did I expect?). Also, it took much longer than 30 minutes to cook. I baked them for an extra 15 minutes and ended up cooking them in a wok with about 1.5 - 2 cups of water, until the water evaporated and the potatoes browned. Might be making this recipe again but will definitely modify it before doing so.

These are wonderful. Thankyou to the reviewers who advised using EVOO. Apart from that I didn't change a thing and there wasn't a scrap left. Many thanks.

These were very good and very easy to make.  If you like rosemary, you will love these potatoes.  I cooked at 350 for about 45 minutes instead because I had other dishes in the oven.  Turned out great.

Simple, delicious side! Used fresh Rosemary, added a little garlic salt as well -- other than that, nothing needs changing : )

This was a lovely side dish. Added my usual garlic and onion powders and used evoo. The rosemary gave it a wonderful flavor. Thanks to you and Mandy for suggesting this recipe!

I like these a lot and my potatoes came out perfectly cooked after 30 minutes.  They were just a bit oily, so next time I'll use less butter/olive oil.  I think I'll also add a little garlic.

I did not like these. The rosemary was way over-powering and the cook time was way off. After 45 minutes in the oven, I ended up putting these in the microwave.

These were pretty good, although I substituted the vegetable oil for more-healthy olive oil. I also suggest adding fresh garlic to the mix.  I will probably make these again.

These potatoes were very pretty and delicious.  I added more seaoning than suggested.  I baked min covered for about 40 min. then I refrigerated it overnight.  I uncovered it and baked it for 15 minutes and they were perfect and beautiful!

These potatoes were delicious in flavor. However, I prefer a more crispy potatoe dish. Maybe broiling the last few minutes would have helped.

Fast, easy & delicious. A nice change from the everyday side dish. I did not cover (as per my husband's request!) and it gave some of the potatoes a very nice crust.

Very simple recipe - added thinly sliced onions and a dash of minced garlic to the potatoes.  Also topped with some grated parmesan cheese.  Baked for 1 hour instead of 30 minutes, stirring occasionaly like the recipe suggests.  The first time I tried this recipe, I used dried rosemary...would not do that again.  Fresh tastes much better.

These potatoes were great! I just had to cook them about 15-20 minutes longer than what the recipe called for.  I like my potatoes soft though, so the time might be ok if you want firmer potatoes. I will also at least double this recipe next time (serving 4 people) They tasted wonderful though!!

Unfortunately, these took a lot longer than the recipe stated, thus I couldn't even serve them with dinner. I would suggest cutting your potatoes into SMALL wedges, or else add to the cooking time considerably. Plus, I would also add more seasoning, as they were a little bland for my liking.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I used 4 tablespoons of butter and only 1 tablespoon of oil (vs. 3 and 3).  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable and also added in 3 tablespoons of minced garlic.  Very good.

I have made this recipe for many years.  Fresh rosemary is this best.  Coat the potatoes with  enough olive oil plus a little bit of fresh garlic and cook until brown on one side.  Turn and cook again until brown and tender.  My girls who are now adults still call them "Mom's oven potatoes"

Very good... since it's pretty hard to make potatoes inedible!  Definitely go with the boiling method, and not use as much butter and oil!  Will try again that way!

I used baby red potatoes cut into wedges and had no trouble with them cooking within the time given.  However, they were "swimming in butter" to quote another reviewer and the overall appearance and flavor was nothing special.

This was good, but it took much longer than the suggested time to bake (I thought I cut the pieces small enough, but I guess they need to be even smaller). I also had to use only olive oil because one of my guests can't have dairy products. I think I'll try this again using the butter & adding more salt. It lacked some flavor in my opinion.

Great tasting!  My family loved them and I made 4 times the amount (24 potatoes) and they were almost all gone.  Next time, if it won't alter the flavor or cooking time, I will skin them because I'm not fond of the skin.  But it does take 45 mins. to cook them and they came out perfect and my whole house smelled like rosemary.  A definite keeper.

We thought these potatoes were GREAT and so easy to make.  I cut my potatoes in smaller pieces and I think that helped with the cook time, but like other reviewers agree that they do require more time in the oven than the recipe calls for.

fabulous..For a young woman trying to please her family... these potatoes were a hit with my 3 1/2 yr old.. There were no leftovers as my husband and I cleaned the tray.  Best bet, use only 2 table spoons of oil and garnish with a pinch or two of salt and garlic powder

Simple to prepare.  However the results left much to be desired.  Despite the overwhelming smell and taste of rosemary, the potatoes were otherwise very blah and tasteless.

This was a good recipe- but it inlcuded a bit too much butter for me.  I included 1 tablespoon of butter and lightly sprayed the potatoes with a butter flavored cooking spray.  A variation that turned out well= substitue fresh dill for the rosemary.

Easy side dish. Great presentation. I will make again. I used 8 potatoes for that amount of rosemary and it was not overpowering

It was a big hit. I made the potatoes with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. I feel this is still too much oil and butter. Next time I am going to try 4 tablespoons of olive oil and add more if that doesn't seem enough. I also cover it for 20 minutes and uncovered it for 10 minutes.

Made it using 1 tbsp butter (for flavor), 2tbsp vegetable oil (for consistency/burn factor, & 3 tbsp olive oil (for healthier choice. Came out so good there were no leftovers. Even from the elementary aged kids.

I made this for Easter dinner as a side.  I followed some of the recommendations and didn't use the butter and vegetable oil, but instead used olive oil.  I covered the potatoes in foil, but when they were done, they seemed a little soft, so I put them back in the oven, spread on a cookie sheet, uncovered for another 20 minutes.  Then they were perfect, with a nice crispness on the outside.   I will make this again, but will do the whole cooking without the foil on the cookie sheet.

Used less potatoes as it was dinner for two and it seemed to be too much. Wish I hadn't because they were so worth getting seconds of.

You can't go wrong with rosemary potatoes.  I added garlic salt and onions to give it a flavor boost.  Always a hit!

These were still raw after 40 minutes. It threw off the timing of everything,  as I was trying to have it done at the same time as salmon and shrimp.

I made this, and it was delicious. Based on past reviews I altered the recipe slightly, using only 3tbs of olive oil in replace of both the oil and butter, adding chopped purple onion, sliced garlic, about a teaspoon of garlic salt, about a tablespoon of fresh ground pepper, and about a tablespoon of dried parsley. I cut each potato in half, then quartered the halves as my red potatoes were quite large. From there I added everything to a ziplock bag and let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour. After that, I lined a glass baking dish with foil, sprayed the foil with cooking spray, and poured all the contents of the bag onto the foil. I baked as directed for 35 minutes, then uncovered the mixture and put it in the broiler for 10 minutes (not because the potatoes weren't done, but because they were obviously soft and saturated in oil.

Yummy!  I used about a TBS each of olive oil and butter, and used garlic salt instead of regular salt. I love rosemary, so I doubled the amount. It was tasty, but next time I'll add even more! I baked them for about an hour, uncovering for the last 10 minutes.

Super-easy and delicious. I added a few pinches of garlic salt to round out the rosemary flavor, and I imagine that fresh minced garlic would also make a tasty addition to this recipe. It's also versatile; goes grest with chicken or steak.

I eyeballed the measurements in this simple recipe, went heavy on the rosemary and light on the fat and this turned out excellent.  I cut the potatoes into bite sized pieces and this took about 45 minutes to bake, even after turning up the heat.  I pulled it out of the oven every 10 minutes to distribute the oil and rosemary, this must have increased the baking time.  I also turned the oven to about 475 for the last 10 minutes to get the nice golden brown potato my family loves.  This turned out great!  Thanks!!

Great recipe! I tweaked it a little. I added some garlic powder and parmesan cheese. And I threw every thing in a freezer bag for easy coating (as another member suggested). I microwaved the potatoes a bit (5 mins) before I baked them and still found that the bigger pieces weren't ready. I ate the smaller pieces and let the bigger ones bake for leftovers. I will definitely try this recipe again!

I asked my boyfriend to make dinner for me while I was at school.  He made these potatoes along with the Garlic Chicken recipe.  He pan fried them first for a bit, then threw them right on top of two pieces of chicken in a 5x9 Pyrex loaf pan and popped it in the oven uncovered. It was a great dinner :)

I've made this twice for my in-laws and everyone loved them.  After looking at other reviews I think I will throw in a little bit of garlic next time.  The potatoes do take longer to cook then stated in the recipe.  I cut mine into bite size pieces instead of wedges, helps to speed the cooking time. Will definitely make again.

Though they were easy to make, as others have said, they take far longer to cook than the recipe states. Because it took about twice as long, my dinner had to be served minus the potatoes. In the end, their flavor was lacking and they had a bit too much butter. I'll definitely try again with a few tweaks.

I made this as a side when we had guests for dinner, and this was the hit of the meal!  I made one small addition... I mixed in a Tablespoon of garlic salt with the rosemary & butter.  It added a really nice flavor and even my husband who hates garlic, loved this dish!  Will definitely make again!

Made as is...these are really lacking flavor. Sorry to say this but following recipe to a t, isn't recommended. It really needs some spicing up to be appreciated. That's just my opinion though. Thanks for the recipe anyhow!

Loved it! So easy.
I added some drizzled honey on the bottom of my baking dish and stirred the potatoes around before baking. My husband and I gobbled up the whole pan b/f the kids could even get a sample.

I love these potatoes!  They were an absolute hit at Thanksgiving AND Christmas!  Something cute that I did - I used an apple corer to chop the potatoes...  It was quite the topic of discussion!

I prepared them as the recipe read - only I had to use dried rosemary b/c I didn't have any fresh on hand.  I also added a few grinds of garlic/sea salt as well as fresh pepper.  I recommend serving immediately as the potatoes will continue to soak up any left over butter/oil mixture.  Good luck!

They weren't the best red potatoes but they weren't gross either.  Nothing special about these potatoes except its very very easy to make.

Very easy except for cutting up potatoes.  (I hate cutting things up.)  I love herbed red potatoes and have had other versions with a bit more zing, but these were good.  And they always "present" very nicely on the plate.  (I didn't count the total time, but I do recall them taking forever to get done.)

These potatoes were wonderful and very flavorful, however as other have mentioned, it does take a lot more time for cooking. We have a convection oven, so suggestion would be to either use that setting if available, or 'low broil'. Will definitely make again!

Had a good taste, but don't overdo the rosemary as I did.  i boiled for 10 minutes first before putting in the over, which worked out good.

Was delecious, I added italian herbs and cooked for 40 minutes rather than 30 until wedges were crispy. Although oil/butter measurements could have been cut in half - I drained the excess about halfway though.

If I could only eat one food for the rest of my life, it would be potatoes; I love them in nearly any form!  I halved the amount of potatoes for the two of us, using baby white potatoes from our garden.  I kept the rosemary at 1T and would even increase it more next time.  I accidentally kept the oven temp at 475F (meant to do 450F!), and at the midway point, I put the casserole dish on the bottom rack of the oven.  Worked just fine!  Hub was home late from work, so they ended up in the oven for about 45 minutes and turned out nice and ROASTED.  Used EVOO rather than vegetable oil, along with the butter for better flavor and browning.  Thank you, Bellarouge!

I guess I didn't follow this exactly as it says but did do for the most part. What I did different was that I realized I didn't have rosemary and so I used a Mrs. Dash type seasoning and just sprinkled that all over it. It came out so good though I can't imagine that it really needed too much more. We loved them even made a bit differently. Very tasty!

ANOTHER FAVORITE AND NOW A REGULAR!!  I put the potatoes in the microwave first b/c I make a lot more potatoes than the recipe calls for with a large family.  Fresh rosemary would be nice, but dried gives it super flavor too.  These are DELISH!!

So simple and great tasting.  Just prepare and place in the oven.  I didn't use the oil, I just used 1/2 stick of melted butter, and added sliced onion on top of the potatoes, and
added a pinch of salt and pepper, and baked them slowly at 300 degrees, and about 5 minutes before they were done, I sprinkled them wit grated parmesan cheese, and the turned out great!!

These were delicious.  They took about 30 minutes to cook in my oven, and came out perfect!  The only thing I altered was I used olive oil instead of vegetable.  I used the advice in the description since I didn't have fresh rosemary and used the dried.  We had a lot of leftovers so Saturday morning we are frying them up for hash browns for breakfast!  Mmmmm.... these were excellent!

The potatoes came out great.  I dont think I used enough rosemary though.  I would add more salt and pepper too.  Otherwise it was good.  Oh definatly take the foil off during the last few minutes of cooking to get them little crunchy (but not much).

I LOVE these potatoes, as does my husband. Its so simple, but the flavour is awesome!  I give it a 4 because they can be a little greasy, and they don't really get crispy on the outside which i like.  Although that's just a personal preference!  :)

The potatoes came out wonderfully moist and tasty.  I added the sweet onion during the last 20 minutes of cooking and it was good too.  I love rosemary so this was right up my alley!  I will make these again and again.

Lives up to the description, indeed simple and elegant. Added a quartered vidalia onion halfway through cooking, and slightly reduced the fats as well.  Subtle, delicious side dish.

The recipe was nice and simple, a good way to change the average potato sidedish however I found the cook time too nearly twice as long compared to what is advertised in the recipe.

These potatoes make a big impression on guests when I serve them. They are simple and tasty, but make a beautiful compliment to any main course. I do, however, always add extra salt since potatoes seem to be a bit bland without it.

These tasted OK, but did take a very long time to bake...I actually ended up frying them in a pan since the rest of the dinner was ready long before the potatoes were even close. I agree that they were too oily...cut the oil and butter by half!

We enjoyed these potatoes, but I would tend to agree with some of the other viewers that they could use a little less oil and butter. I also crisped them up a bit under the broiler before serving.May try 3T olive oil and add some minced garlic next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a quick and easy way to make potatoes. However I thought the rosemary taste was too strong.  It did not work well for my family, since  my 4 year old did not care for the rosemary flavoring. Alternatively I would try making this again with a seasoned salt or garlic poweder and completely omit the rosemary.

This is the best recipe I have found so far for baby reds.  I did sprinkle the potatoes with garlic powder as well as the S&P.  Next time I may mix in some minced garlic with the oil and butter.

I used dried rosemary (I didn't think this was bland, but I was liberal with the s+p).  I wouldn't call this an 'elegant' dish, but it did taste very good.  Next time I may take the foil off toward the end and let the potatoes brown up a little bit.

These turned out very delicious! My fiance has been doing most of the cooking and he made them perfectly! If we have fresh rosemary, I'm sure they will be even better than when using dried rosemary.

Easy, tasty side dish.  I used the Pampered Chef Rosemary Herb seasoning (1 T.).  I cooked it a little longer--more like 45 min. for crispier potatoes.  I baked these along with a pork tenderloin.  Add a salad and rolls--great dinner!

These are so yummy and a great alternative to your standard baked potato or mashed potatoes.  If you don't like rosemary, then just subsitute in another spice.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made the recipe as follows, except I sealed all ingredients in a foil and grilled on bbq. Turned out great and I did use less oil and butter and you would not have noticed at all.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because it helped me realize that I'm not that big a fan of Rosemary. These potatoes cooked well and would have been enjoyed more if I would of left out the Rosemary. Thanks anyway, Bellarouge.

I followed the boiling method on this, like the reviewer below me.  Mine came out wonderful, and I was easily able to brown the sides as much as I desired.  I didn't have any problems with too much oil, I just put in enough to coat the bottom of the pan.  Absolutely wonderful recipe.

I am giving these potatoes 5 stars because not only are they delicious but my  eight year old daughter and her two friends raved about them and cleaned their plates.  I served these potatoes with green beans and Roast Chicken with Rosemary from this site.

This was a very tasty and fragrant side dish.  Especially since I tossed it with two big cloves of minced garlic.  However, because of so much oil and butter (which taste great, of course) called for by the recipe, it gave me a tummy ache!  I would definitely cut back next time.

oh my...these were fabulous....I used olive oil instead of veg. oil..
Next time I will use a bit less oil.  My potatoes did only take 30 min. to cook but the wedges were not overly thick.
These potatoes served with the chicken Marsala I (off this site of course) was a hit!

I would add more garlic and rosemary next time.  They came out bland - and, I would let them bake longer, they weren't soft enough.  Good potential though, with some modifications

Simple and delicious! The only thing I did differently was use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.
