Amazing! I am typically not a big fan of potato salad and when I do eat it I prefer mustard potato salad over one that is drowned in mayo. This was excellent and the best potato salad I have ever had. Typically potato salads get better the longer they sit but I found it to be the opposite with this one. It was best right as it was first made and still at room temp. After sitting in the fridge overnight it got more of that mayo twang to it. Just something to keep in mind. The only thing off with this recipe was the amount of potatoes. I used exactly 2 pounds and it could have definitely used 3 pounds if not 4. So, add another pound of potatoes which will make the dish go even further. Win/win. Excellent recipe and thanks for sharing!

Too much work for too little flavor.

The recipe did not specify the heat level of the chilies or the type of pickle relish to use. I used Mild Hatch chilies that I had fire roasted at the store (they roasted them for free) and I chose to use dill pickle relish. I also let the salad chill in the fridge overnight.
The salad was a hit. Delicious! I plan on making this again as soon as possible. Maybe I 'll try it with the Hot Hatch Chilies.

Added one more Hatch chile; otherwise, I made no changes.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.  I served it with my recipe meatloaf stuffed with ham, salami, cheese, mushrooms, and roasted peppers.
