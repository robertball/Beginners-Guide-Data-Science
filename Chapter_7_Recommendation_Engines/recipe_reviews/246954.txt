I am 14 years old and I did make these by myself.  These pancakes are delicious and taste like crepes.  Although I am not Swedish, these are not that hard to make.  The first time I made these I had used a pan but then I had to switch to a griddle  after 1 pancake.  1 batch will provide for 4 people with toppings such as syrup and fruit.  They can be a little hard to flip a first but with little bit of practice you will get the hang of it.
Thanks for the great recipe.

My own Fristedt family recipe (Great-grandma from nineteenth century) is the same except for leaving out sugar and vanilla.  Great-gramma's instructions, written down by Mom, are for half these amounts and include, "if doubling, add another egg" which would be five eggs for these quantities.   You may have to experiment to find the best temperature for your stove and pan.  If you butter the pan you won't have to add butter on your plate, but don't let the butter burn too much.  Here's how to tell when to flip: The first side is done when you see two of these three indicators: the surface is flat, not shiny; the edges are a little brown and lift away from the pan; the steam rising from the surface stops.  Dad liked them with butter and sugar; some like berries or berry syrup.  A few of our friends who lived in Sweden like Nutella.  I like either raspberry preserves or maple syrup--if you use it, get real maple syrup, not corn syrup.  Make them full pan-size and roll 'em up around the topping on your plate!

Fantastic pancakes.  When I was very young,  my Swedish grandmother made pancakes for us.  While nothing will ever live up to those memories, this is the best recipe I have found so far.

I used jumbo eggs, and butter instead of vegetable oil.  The recipe made 18  pancakes, 6" in diameter.  

Rather than trying to flip the thin pancakes in the frying pan, I used 2 pans and flipped the half done pancake into the second pan.   This was much easier and doubled my cooking rate. 

I found a wonderful Lingonberry jam at Ikea.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and it worked out great. The taste was spot on and was great with a little fruit yogurt.

These came out fantastically!  I substituted in vanilla almond milk, and added a bit of cinnamon.

Wouldn't change a thing! These were delicious and perfect consistency. One of my boyfriends favorite breakfasts and he said they taste just like how his aunt made them. Enjoy!

Delicious and authentic.   I wanted to try a different recipe from my mother's , just out of interest.   These came out wonderfully.     My tips are:    Use salted (regular) butter for frying, instead of oil.  I think it adds a lot of flavor.  Also add a pat of butter on the pancakes when serving.      If you don't have lingonberry sauce or jam, you can use another.  Strawberry with a squeeze of lemon on top is a perfect combo of sweet and tart.
p.s. The first pancake usually doesn't come out. We call it "the tester".  After that, the pan will be seasoned and they should come out perfectly.

I make this recipe a few times a month. Depending on how thin I make the pancakes, we get somewhere between eight and twelve per recipe. I like the pancakes a little thicker (but still less than a millimeter thick) where you can really enjoy the egg-iness. My husband likes them thinner to showcase what's inside. My toddler loves then any which way. We can cut them in thirds and roll them up so they are an easy fist food. I use a cast iron skillet on medium low and do a quick swipe of butter in the pan between pancakes. When mixing the batter, add the dry ingredients first then the milk. Get all the clumps out before mixing in the eggs. I try not to get too much air in the batter when I mix in the eggs since I like a denser consistency but you can play around with this as well if you like your pancakes to be really light.  As a kid we grew up eating the pancakes with a squeeze of lemon and some powdered sugar on top. These days, I tend to do a couple tablespoons of Greek yogurt and some good jam with some fresh berries to compliment. For the toddler we do yogurt and applesauce.  Today as a special treat we switched out the yogurt for ricotta cheese which was so yummy. Like a crepe, you can take these in so many different directions.

I added another 1/4 of a cup of sugar for 8 servings and 1/2 cup of peanut butter and it tasted like peanut butter cookies!!!
