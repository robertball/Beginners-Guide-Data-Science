Please note that when I submitted this recipe, I indicated grated citrus peel to taste and barely 1/2 to 1 cup of powdered sugar, again to taste.  My submission did not include the "one cup of candied citron"... I'll assume that the editors added this in error.  With regards to rolling the dough, I found that paper-thin was too difficult to achieve with a rolling pin and was happy to have the pasta machine available.  I agree with the previous review that if you don't get the pastry thin enough the results will disappoint.  I'm sure that those trying to tackle this type of pastry have their own tricks up their sleeves, eveyone finds their best methods.  I do hope that those few tricks I included will help first-timers get good results.  Good luck and good eating.

Way too much citron, it takes away from the cannoli cream taste if all you can taste is citron, peel, fruit etc, no need for the wine in the shell recipe. needing a pasta machine for the thinnest setting is a bit much to ask, you hsould just say how thick the dough should be and people can roll it out. You must have the dough as thin as you can manage it so that it bubbles and blisters or it will be like cardboard

Absolutely Amazing!! I was looking for a descent cannoli shell for my cannoli cream I make and what I got far exceeded my expectations!! Since I knew I was going to eat a cannoli, I wasn't to worried about the "Healthiness" of what I was eating, so I used lard instead of shortening... well because it makes everything taste better. By the way, trying to make this by yourself would be a nightmare. You need an assembly line... people will work for food! I call this the Italian version of the Tamale because the whole family has to help in this process. The one thing that saddened me was that when I stored them in an airtight container, the next day they weren't crispy like the night before =(, but my sadness was soon expelled with a little oven toasting, which brought them right back up to its fresh, crispy self!!  Thanks Lydia!!

A fab 'Shell Recipe'.  I have made cannoli shells for years.  I often look for new recipes and this is absolutely the best.  A bit tricky but not difficult to run through the machine.  After chilling the dough place a lightly floured board under the pasta roller attachment.  Large gumball size balls are pressed into a small pancake then patted on the board and run through the machine dusting with each increment of the rollers.  On my KitchenAid setting 6 is thin enough.  I lay the disc on the board and lightly oil a tube. (don't skip the oil) Lay the tube on one end of the disc and roll the tube.  When you reach the end dab egg white on the flap and finish rolling.  Lightly press the visible flap to make the line somewhat invisible and place in 350 degree veg oil for 2mins.  Remove with tongs to paper towels and repeat.  The previous rolls are cool enough to carefully slide off the tubes in 2 mins. I make only 2 at a time so there is a bit of a pace to keep up with the timer.  It will take about an hour to make 20 shells.  NOTE:  Handle uncooked dough with clean fingertips.  If your not organized you can get the pasta machine too dirty and difficult to clean.  I keep the oil a few feet from the dough.  I also made filling from cannoli-enterprises.com  Many recipes to choose from.  My fav has folded whipped cream. I'm just about out of characters so i will now say good luck and have fun.

My husband has been wanting cannoli for a long time now. He cant have sugar and I thought that with out white sugar they may come out bad and not taste "AUTHENTIC" but we substituted loose equal for white sugar and the shells came out great. and of course the filling was easy to substitue with equal and it tasted just like he remembered when he was a kid. Thanks for the recipe. We will make these again for sure.

Great recipe.  I don't know too many Italian recipes that don't include Marsala wine so I used it, I know it serves a purpose.  As for the citron I don't care for it in cannoli anyway so I left it out and used coconut on the ends or the cannolis just like the Italian bakery near me does and they tasted the same.

I have been making cannolis for 30+years in our Italian family. This shell recipe is just as good as mine. I give the shells 5 stars. The filling is nothing like ours. I differ in the filling as such: I use ricotta used for pastries such as cannolis called IMPASATA RICOTTA .  This is what your bakeries and grocery stores in the bakery dept use. I find it in Italian pizza stores ask management to order. Best company to order from is Cisco Co but any will be good. It comes in 5 lb plastic containers and be frozen if necessary. If you do this I suggest make the filling first then freeze in batches for later use. To the ricotta I add confectionery sugar to taste and anise liquor to taste or rum liquor to taste but not both. No citron found most friends not Italian does not like. Then mini chocolate chips. Dip ends of shells in melted chocolate or gnache then in crushed pistachio nuts and enjoy.

The shells came out SO good!!  I was very pleased.  I DID add a tad more sugar, just because I tend to do that, but that's just me.  Also, the wine was the PERFECT touch to bring the flavors together.  The filling, on the other hand was tasty, but not firm enough to pipe well into the shells.  (It came out quite a mess, so I ended up scooping the filling with the shells in the end, since this was a trial run for me.)  I would HIGHLY recommend draining the ricotta overnight BEFORE you begin this process, and you'll end up much happier.  I also added some vanilla, and left out the citron in place of mini chocolate chips, since I'm not a fan of citron.  :D  All in all, this was a success for me, and Pop will be pleased when I come home for Christmas and make him this treat.  Thanks!!  
Note:  The shell making is NOT a one-person job.  I did it (and nearly set the dorm on fire MANY times) so it's POSSIBLE,  but way easier and more fun if you have someone rolling and forming the dough around the tubes, while someone else is frying them and then removing the shells, since they take around 30 seconds to cook.

Good job...just a couple of things..I add 2 tsp. vanilla and 3 drops cinnamon oil (not powdered cinnamon, which is a different taste) to the filling to get that authentic bakery taste. I like to use part candied citron and part orange peel. A few tsb. cocoa and a little extra sugar to taste and you have an amazing chocolate filling.  Lastly, it's worth it to try and get the *real* ricotta, ricotta impastata, which is different from regular/supermarket ricotta. Much drier.  If you have an outlet near you that makes fresh ravioli they might sell you some. Otherwise I drain whole milk supermarket ricotta a few days and sometimes add some dry milk powder to thicken it up, but nothing beats the impastata.  I also roll out the dough by hand, you don't need a machine..good exercise! Admittedly the machine makes it easier.

What a fabbbbulous recipe!  Making the dough was a piece of cake...and I was ALONE!  It sounds intimidating, but one does NOT need a whole family or neighborhood to get involved, although it could be a little more fun.  Firstly, I mixed all the dry ingredients in my food processor for 10 sec. (I also added 1/2 tsp of cocoa powder), then added the 3 tbsp of lard and pulsed for another 10 sec.  In a separate container, I mixed all the wet ingredients and the eggs together.  Through my food processor hole, I slowly added the liquid mixture while the processor was running.  Once all the liquid was combined, I let the processor run for appx another minute until all the ingredients formed into a ball.  Pulled the dough out, and kneaded for 2-3 min then covered with plastic and threw the dough in the fridge for an overnight rest.  Voila...I bought a pasta roller attachment for my Kitchen Aid to flatten the dough and it worked like a breeze.  The end result was wonderful.  The cannoli had a beautiful smell from the marsala wine.  I filled some of the cannolis with the ricotta filling ( I used fresh ricotta - not the impatasta bcuz I cannot find any in Quebec, Canada), and others with homemade gelato.  For the ricotta filling, I also added a few tbsp of mascarpone as suggested and it gave the filling a nice smell as well.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.

The cannoli shells I made from this recipe were excellent! For want of a pasta mangle, I had to roll the dough out by hand. I can see how the crispiness would be improved if the shells had been thinner, but for the record, I was at least able to get the suggested number of shells (30). I would recommend a little cocoa powder, but otherwise the shell recipe was perfect.  I made some modifications to the filling recipe: 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and almond extracts, a little citrus zest (as Lydia recommends in her review), and drained ricotta. (I put the ricotta on a coffee filter in a colander over a bowl, covered it with plastic wrap, and placed a bowl on top to press the liquid through. The whole apparatus sat in the fridge overnight.) I find this makes the filling less runny when it needs to sit out for some time, e.g. at the dessert table of a pot luck.

The shell was recipe was excellent. I had to add a couple of Tbs of water to get my dough to come together. But it did nicely. The narrowest sitting on my manual pasta machine cranked out shells that were blistering and crunchy, but also fragile. I might try the 2nd to narrowest setting the next time around. I also opted out of adding citron. Instead, I mixed in a tad amount of vanilla and almond extract.

I too have found this recipe worthy of praise.  The only change I would make is that when dealing with pastry type doughs such this one....always sprinkle rolling or kneading area with more 10x sugar then flour.  This will add to the crispness and lessen the sometime pasty texture that flour alone gives.  Thank you for sharing.

i add a touch of orange flavor, grated orange peel, cherries and choc. chips, also if you dont want to take time to drain ricotta, add 1 package of instant vanilla pudding  when mixing, this firms it up  nicely. also, when in  a hurry  you can buy ready made  boxes of cannoli shells,especially when you dont need quite as many,lol

These are the best cannoli shells ever.  No one in my family likes candied fruit, so I left it out.

Tried making Canollis for the first time and it was a lot of fun. After whipping up the filling, I cut it in half and added almond extract to one, and sprinkled in freshly grated orange zest to the other one. ALSO we added almost 3 talblespoons Marscapone to the mixtures, and that really pulled it all together. Thanks for adding a great place to start.

This was an AMAZING cannoli recipe! I've been on the hun for the perferct cannoli and the shell is more  than i can ask for! The filling was a little sweet for me but I guess I added more than half a cup, oh well the shells are delicious and i will DEFINITLY be using this recipe again. P.S. The thinner you roll out the dough for the shell, the better!

Great recipe!  I didn't have some of the ingredients, but still wanted to try it, and I'm glad I did!  I used orange juice instead of the wine and vinegar, and on the filling I left out the citron and added vanilla and almond extract.  I rolled out the dough to 1/8" with a rolling pin and sliced it into small chips to fry.  Served a few chips with a dollop of filling and sliced strawberries in a sundae glass.  It was great!  Looking forward to trying again with the wine.

Amazing dough recipe.  My pasta roller has 6 settings, next time I'll only go up to 5 and then hand roll them after cutting so that they're a little oblong.  I wasn't able to deep fry, so I baked them in a convection oven @ 400 - it worked great.  Dust 1 side of the shell with flour, wrap around form, then lightly brush oil on the outside with a pastry brush (I actually used the back of a spoon).  Just a couple minutes and they're perfect!  I also changed up the filling a bit: 2 c. warm milk + 6 Tbsp. flour (mix well & cook for 15 mintues).  Cool to room temp.  Add ricotta, chocolate, powdered sugar (I used 3/4 c.) + 1 Tbsp vanilla.  Whip for 10 mintues w/elec. mixer  Chill then fill.  I didn't add citrus zest, but will next time.  I'm from the east side of Detroit with a TON of Italian bakeries.  Best cannoli in town is from Giuseppes and this is pretty close.

well i made it :/...it wasn't that great..didn't like the filling..i think a lighter sweeter filling would have made this alot better..the dough wasn't bad though..i had to keep on rolling it so it got thin enough and fried up real nice..i will use the dough again but not the filling :o

This was soo good!  The dough recipe turned out great.  I added lemon rind instead of the orange to the filling and it was great!  This is a two person recipe though; I rolled the dough and my husband deep fried and it worked out perfect!

This recipe was terrific!  It was very helpful since I had never made cannolis before.  The other reviewers are right that this is a "more than one person" job.  The one this that I did change is that I doubled the sugar for the filling.  I also dipped the cannoli edges in chocolate before filling.  We are sugar-fanatics in our house so the sweeter the better.  I will use this recipe again.

Great recipe! We used this recipe to teach a cooking class to our homeschooled children, and it turned out beautifully! The tiny thing we changed, was since we're not a fan on citron, was to just grate some lemon zest and use that....the tinest amount really went far and provided a beautiful filling. For those who said it's too wet, make sure you are using whole milk ricotta and not that part skim junk. It makes a difference. We piped the filling in and then sprinkled mini chocolate chips on the end and gave a hit with powder sugar and they were perfect! A+ assignment and easy enough a 10 yr old can make (with help frying the shells of course).

A great recipe to be sure. BUT, I find that the ricotta where I live is WAY to thin. I strained it over night in a sieve lined with a few layers of coffee filters (it's what I had on hand). and a heavy plate on top. The Cheese needs to be fairly dry and firm.
Again a great recipe thank you Lydia.

Fantastic shell recipe, the marsala gives it an incredible flavor. We went ahead and rolled out the dough, and even with a LOT of rolling, it really isn't possible to get it perfect without a pasta machine, but it still came out really good.

My only complaint is that the filling recipe neglects one very important step: drain the ricotta first! If you just follow this recipe, the filling can be very wet and it doesn't stay inside the shells, you need to strain the ricotta first to remove some liquid.

This is a good recipe, however I'm just not a fan of pure ricotta filling.. When I was a kid my grandma who was from Italy made cannoli for me on special occasions and she always used mascarpone cheese. I personally think it makes for a deeper, creamier cannoli filling, but maybe I'm just biast to grandma :)

I just made this Jan 1, 2011 and WOW!  It does take a lot longer to do alone and without a pasta machine but for a first time they were WONDERFUL!  I made 34 from standard with 1 inch hole. and 4-5inch circles. I read the reviews first to see if people tried different things and the min. changes were great too.  I make lots of fried dough so I went with the reviews and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond ext. after the Marasala  and the shells were perfect. Fried in Veg. oil the thinner the better.  For the filling, I used Ricotta Impastasta (also review recommeneded- can be hard to get-rest. might sell to you) its dry and didn't need to drain it over night.  I also went with the suggestion of orange zest instead of the citron and they were delicious.  I did 1/2 fill with zest and the other 1/2 chocolate chip. (which would be great with the orange zest). Note:  Because I used fresh ric. impastasta from a farm I had to add a lot of confection. sugar  stirring at 1/2 cup at a time (easier to mix at room temp) until I got it sweet...I ended up using 2  1/4 cup and it prob. could have used a little more but we liked it the way it was.    THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE.  We brought some Cannolis from local bakeries including a great Italian one and you couldnt tell which was which except diff. flavors...we actually preferred this shell to the others too.   It might take be time consuming but SO WORTH the effort! YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!   Even the kids devoured them!

Oh my GOD. These were so good. They take some time, but are fun to make with friends. I think it would be hard to make these by your self. Everything blended well. I WILL BE MAKING THESE AGAIN!  I added nutmeg and didn't add the citron. It turned out great. I also drizzled chocolate over them.. WOW, you wont be able to stop eating them… These are fancy and very impressing looking to serve to guests.

I used another recipe for the shells that I love, so I only made the filling, but I had to add 1-1/2 t. vanilla and tripled the sugar.

Excellent shell. I didn't have cannoli tubes so instead I rolled out the dough (with a roller. Takes a lot of work but it's doable) and cut out small circles with the top of a drinking glass. I put a couple fork marks through each circle because they seemed to be puffing up quite a bit in the first round. Filling is good.

Made this recipe as a gift to my husband.  The dough was very simple to make and the filling was delicious.  I added a tiny bit of vanilla to the filling.  I did not have tubes to make cannoli shells, so I improvised and cut the dough into "chips" and served them with the filling as "dip".  People thought this was great!!!

so i changed it a bit due to the fact that i did not have sweet Marsala or fruit citron. Instead of the wine, i put in a little bit of rum and added the water to make the dough. Instead of the fruit, i added grated an orange peel and lemon peel.  This cannoli recipe was a hit. It's not too sweet and not boring by any means. Thank you!!

Almost identical to receipe given to me years ago by a dear friend from the Boston, MA Italian community.  Loranne was a marvelous "comfort food" chef and I treasure her receipes.  I usually do canolli during the Christmas holiday season and give as gifts to friends and family.  I use a dowel the size of a closet pole and these come out perfect!    Kathy T.  Hyder, AK

My first time to make these and they came out just "perfect", even without the pasta roller! The trick is, let the dough rest for at least 2 hours. When rolling, dust the work surface with a thin coating of flour. And i used a cookie cutter for convenience. My kids LOVE it!!! Thanks for sharing!

These came out wonderful. I made my own adjustments to the ricotta filling to taste. But I followed the shell recipe exactly and it was 5 stars by itself. Really wasn't as difficult as it thought it would be. Thanks.

I made these for a christmas work function and they were a hit.  I couldn't get enough compliments on the shells.  Definitely glad I had a pasta machine, I think that is the key.  So light and tasty.

This recipe is fabulous! I love to bake and recently decided to try my hand at making cannoli. I originally tried a recipe that came out horrible. The dough was like elastic and incredibly hard to roll out. This recipe is the exact opposite. I feel the thing that made it so easy was using my pasta maker. This was the first time I had ever used a pasta maker so once I realized that you need to flour the dough after every pass through the machine, it went very smoothly. The only things I would suggest are the possibility of adding a bit more sugar to the filling, but that is all a matter of personal taste. I prefer my cannoli a little more on the sweeter side. And DEFINITELY let the cheese sit over night to remove excess moisture. This made a huge difference. I will definitely be holding on to this recipe for many many future batches.

I just made these, well rather stuffed them. next time I'll try and make my own shells. I used the mini shells. I didn't add citron, because I don't really like it, BUT I did add the tiny chocolate chips and some chopped orange peel.  the filling was so simple and delicious. I made twenty and had some filling leftover (at least half) to do something else with!!  thank you!!

Just made these and am very disappointed.  We just returned from NYC where we had connoli in Little Italy at Cafe Palermo.  They were the best and I hoped to try and duplicate them.  The shell flavor is ok.  I did not use a pasta roller, so I think they would have been better if I had rolled them thinnner.  

The filling was grainy and not sweet enough.  I used whole milk ricotta and drained it overnight.  Don't know what went wrong, but I could not get it close to being smooth.  Finally whipped up some heavy cream and folded that in which helped some.  Maybe what we had at La Paloma was not real Italian cannoli.

I wanted to share how much fun my daughter and I had, making these. She found your recipe while looking for an "authentic Italian" dessert to make/contribute to her fifth grade class, for a unit they are studying. Impetuous bakelette that she is, she didn't fully read ALL your tips... We recovered. :-D She added a bit more sugar/choco-chips to the filling (MOM! My class won't LIKE it, if I DON'T!), and I fashioned the needed tubes by rolling tin foil around a small wooden rolling pin I have. PERFECT. The pastry is a bit "bready" (over kneading/rolling, as we have no pasta machine), But YUMMY, just the same. THANK YOU. :-)

This recipe had a nice flavor, but it was too watery.  I would suggest draining the ricotta cheese overnight in a cheese cloth to get rid of the moisture.  I also added Amaretto for extra flavor.

I have never made cannolis before so I used this recipe for the filling. I bought my shells at an Italian gourmet shop. I doubled the amount of powdered sugar as it wasn't sweet enough for me. I also added vanilla and put in more mini choc chips. I added almonds also. Yum!

This is a home run! Well at least the filling I had to make them fast and bought the shells didn't have the time to make the shells. I also made a second type based off of your recipe I substituted Neutella in place fo the powedered sugar and white chips... Not "AUTHENTIC" but very tasty and your awsome recipe made it possible. Also way better then the pricy ones you get here in NJ that arent very good you got to cross a bridge to get a decent cannoli at bst, but not when you have this recipe!!!! Thank you I used them as party favors went over HUGE!!!! Again a home run

I used just the filling and filled store purchased Cannoli shells. I made the filling using just a little lemon and orange peel, as suggested. While they tasted good, the texture was a little gritty. The next day, after sitting in the refrigerator they did taste better. I think I might have taken out too much liquid from the Ricotta cheese.

Shell recipe was flawless. Just make sure your dough isn't sticky if you use a pasta roller. I presonally like marscapone in my cannoli filling, so I subbed out some of the ricotta. I also wanted peppermint, dark chocolate cannoli, so I added some peppermint extra and also dipped the ends of the shells in dark chocolate and crushed mint. This recipe is an excelllent base and I'm glad to have found it!

I really liked the idea of using a pasta maker for getting the dough to the right thickness! Recipe was easy to follow. This is the second time I've made cannoli. The first recipe I tried was a nightmare.

This recipe was very good.  I've never made cannoli before, and I don't have cannoli tubes, so I used dowel rods cut to be four or five inches long.  I couldn't get the dough to roll on the thinnest setting of the pasta machine; it kept tearing.  So I kept it on setting four. Because it wasn't as thin as intended, it yielded seventeen.  Instead of tongs, a spatula worked just fine, and I used freshly grated orange peel, about half a cup, instead of the candied citron.  It was so good, and my family loved it!

Wow, this was a new experience for me... I received a new Kitchen Aid for Christmas and have been dying to use it and I thought this would be a great recipe to start, but I did not really need it.  I also received a pasta maker that someone did not use now what a perfect time to get one of these.  I followed the instructions exactly never using a pasta maker before I found that moving from one setting to the next until you get to lowest was not a good idea, when cooking these shells they were paper thin, I had to throw those away.  I'm not sure if some pasta machine settings are different but the lowest setting was to thin for me.  I pretty much kept the setting on 4 but I think setting 3 might have been good too.  I had a hard time keeping the dough wrapped around Cannoli tubes even using the egg whites there was no definite system.  The recipe said it make 30 shells but I think by the time I was done I came out with about 16 shells!  But I think with practice I might get better. When it came time to make the filling I did not have the candied citron but I did use lemon zest about one lemon when I tasted the filling I could not believe how delicious it was and it tasted exactly like cannoli filling from an Italian bakery I was sooo impressed!  When tasting the whole product together I felt the shells were not as crispy as they should be. This recipe was a lot of work, but a great learning experience and so much fun and I think the product tasted great and looked great!

I would substitute candied pineapple or a mixture of candied pineapple, green or red cherries --available at Christmas time in the grocery. The fruit keeps well unopened for a while. I do not like citron at all and would most definitely replace it.

While the recipe for the shells is alright, the filling is just off, grainy. Perhaps straining the cheese like other recipes call for or adding some vanilla might make it more palatable.

I loved how the shells turned out, but I’m not a fan of the texture of ricotta cheese. For my filling, I whipped an 8oz block of cream cheese with about a tablespoon of powdered sugar and then mixed in a packet of instant vanilla pudding and 2 cups of milk. Once it was thoroughly mixed, I added half a bag of semisweet chocolate chips. So good!

I will admit to being skeptical about the Marsala wine when I first was looking at this recipe, but the shells really are absolutely delicious. The only substitution I made was in the filling. I am less of a citrus person, so I swapped 3/4 tsp vanilla for the lemon, and it is very tasty and not too sweet. For this first pass, I used grocery store whole milk ricotta and drained it for half a day or so, which left the filling a really nice consistency. I may try the impastata cheese others recommend someday, but this way worked very well. Now I just have to get myself a fryer, because I’m not great at deep frying on the stove and maintaining a consistent oil temp, which you really need for this. The only last thing I would say is that on the very last setting on my pasta maker, I found the shells came out too thin and delicate. So, I didn’t go quite that far after the first few. Definitely going to make these again.

There appears to be a typo in quantities, most likely in the quantity of Marsala wine.  Following the quantities given results in a soup-like mixture.  I recovered by adding more and more flour, which enabled me to make some cannoli shells, but they were bread-like, not crisp.  I'll try the recipe again, using 1/4 cup of wine rather than 1/2 cup, then review again.

My review is mainly for the cannoli shells, I followed the recipe to the letter, right down to using my pasta maker on the thinnest setting to roll around the tubes.  My 10 year old son and I had fun making these, we partnered upon rolling the dough out and onto the cannoli forms, and I fried them.  By the end of it all, we had 40 cannoli shells, and half the dough is still in the fridge.  They fry very quickly...2 minutes or so, and turn a lovely golden colour, and blister everywhere!  I was actually getting  lazy, so I started using a thicker setting on the pasta maker, as the thin ones are so flaky and fragile.  
  For the filling, my son didn't like the grainy texture of the drained ricotta, and we could not find mascarpone, so I added a tub of creme fraiche to the filling.  Also didn't use lemon zest, but vanilla instead, and added some grated dark chocolate to some.  We ate cannoli in NYC for the first time, and have been waiting to try to make them at home, and these come pretty close to the original.  Can't wait to try a variety of fillings...pistachio, limoncello, dark chocolate, cherry and almond...endless possibilities!

HELP!!  I followed the recipe for the shells exactly as written.  Refrigerated dough for 2 hours.  However, when we put the dough through the machine rollers, it came out with holes in it.  We could not get it thin enough and only used the first setting.  Can someone respond and tell me what I did wrong or what I can do to get it right? Thank you for this recipe. Lydia.

LOVE! My pasta roller on my kitchen aid  has 8 settings. I liked 7th the best not the thinnest. I got more bubbles on 7th. Also I always throw some cream cheese or marscapone in with ricotta filling to add more flavor and stability to filling- Approx  8oz. And tsp vanilla. Wilton makes tubes bought mine on Amazon. Great recipe! Makes ALOT!! I cut recipe in half and had over 20!!

First time ever making cannolis and these turned out great! I didn’t have a pasta machine so I had to roll them thin myself, which wasn’t ideal but Ok! I also learned that the cannolis come off a lot better if the cannoli tubes have been soaked in some oil before use, and the flour dusting also helped! Didn’t make any changes.

I baked the cannoli shells instead of frying them.  We didn't like the orange  zest used in the filling.  The next time I won't put any fruit zest in. Also, I don't own a pasta machine so.hand rolled the dough. I did have trouble getting it as thin as it should have been. I had seen recipes where it called to drain the ricotta.  Should have listened.  Even though it was bought at Walmart and in those plastic tubes like cottage cheese and didn't appear to have liquid in it,  when I mixed the filling and it sat in the refrigerator for a few hours, there was liquid in the bowl. We liked the shells, even if they were too thick. I will try this again.  But may ask a friend for help, especially if I deep fry them. Do not try that alone!

They turned out ok, I think that I did something wrong. I would have got 26 shells, but a couple opened up while frying, and the first 7 I tried to bake instead of frying and they turned out to be too dense. My pasta was very elastic. I cut the 5" rounds with a cutter and by the time I wrapped the forms, they were 3". so I had to work them on the forms. After frying in Peanut Oil, The shells were puffy and fluffy and not hard lilke a canoli shell should be. They are very tasty though. I will give it a couple of more trys.

Pasta maker is a must have as it makes for easier rolling out the doe. This was a very good recipe, although I came up with my very own for the shells and filling years ago. I am sorry, but I do not share my recipes with others; however, I will sell my fresh made to order kits, my shells and filling are made fresh, but you MUST fill them yourself. Please do NOT ask me to fill the shells, as doing so will make for a soggy yucky shell. I do supply the order with filled and sealed disposable  piping bags for your ease and and convenience. Just cut the tip of bag and pipe batter from one side of the shell from the middle out and repeat for the other side. Directions and recommendations will be provided with each order. Shoot me an email for ordering info and cost.

I made exactly the way the recipe is written. I personally would put more confectioners sugar. When it was put into the canolli it seemed less sweet than when it was tried before. Don’t make too far ahead as the canolli will get soggy. Actually, I made filling exact but bought the canolli form to save work.

I made this Cannoli recipe a few years ago at Christmas  and everyone loved them.  So i am using this same recipe this year to make for Christmas once again. It's definitely a great recipe. I did omit the citrus peel and was very pleased with the taste, but I  think I will try the vanilla extract this year, and yes the Marsala wine is a must have in the dough.

I make it with mascarpone cheese because it comes out smoother. The shells are very easy and flavorful. You do need to roll out the dough very thin. I don't have a pasta maker, but I do use my tortilla press and it works great at achieving a thin  disk

I took time to drain the Ricotta and now the mix is so dry it will hardly stir. I wish I had kept the liquid to add it back. :(

I just made the shells and used my own family recipe for the filling. The shells have a great flavor - just what I was looking for - I used my kitchen aide for the kneading part as I have carpel tunnel and it was fine . I also had to put the shells in the oven the next day to make them crispy like I enjoy -  maybe my dough wasn’t thin enough to begin with for frying . I made this recipe alone and would not do that again - definitely requires 3 people . They fry so fast I had a hard time keeping up .

These are the most delicious shells!!! I did not have a pasta machine, but I had no trouble rolling them to the appropriate thinness. 
I dipped the shell ends in melted chocolate chips and added whipped cream to the filling. 
Amazing!

I have been making cannolis for 40+ years  and do them myself. I have now through the years purchased metal forms till now I have about a hundred. This way , I roll and seal them all so I then alone fry them in my double fryer. I use to use cut up broom sticks for forms like my grandmother did along with my   metal forms till I got enough forms to use up all my dough. You have to really watch when they fry as they don't take long to fry n burns quickly if left unattended.  I alone , through the years become fast enough to do this without help., but getting friends to help is also a good way to have a fun day making these with each having a part making , with listening to some beautiful Italian music , or just a good project n doubling dough so each can take some home. 
This recipe is as good as they get Except. For one change. I use impassata ricotta. It a thickened ricotta used for pastries. I order it through some Italian pizza places or warehouse stores. Need to check places where they sell cannolis . It comes in 5 lb buckets n prices around $12-$17 for 5 lbs n fills about 50 cannolis depending on your size of shells. I usually double shell recipe n store the extra shells as needed. They will last quite a long time in a sealed airtight container up to a month. To the impassata I use xxx sugar to sweeten to taste (as my nana did when making for so long , I don't measure anymore, just seem to know how much) but when people ask me for recipe , I then put ingredients in measur

Like all recipes, it will require tweaking. Its a good recipe though.  Good Italian cannolis are pretty simple and such things as only using riciotta and sugar for the filling are pretty much standard procedure.  The dough you are doing is pretty good. I would skip the Marsala since it isnt always available. The chocolate dip.. accurate and the tiny chocolate chips after the cream filling is applied is right on. If you cant get cannoli tubes, there are options. You can use 3/4" wood dowels sanded and oiled. Works fine. Also, metal tubing like curtain rods will work also. Cut to length and all the burrs removed works just fine. also, I wouldnt use anything in the filling at all. No zest.. nothing. IF.. you want authentic. If you are going for the personal touch... then experiment. Thats what cooking is all about. Trying, failing, altering things and succeeding. very good recipe.

I didn't have Marsala so I used Cream Sherry.  I would cut the shell recipe down a great deal, as this recipe will make 48 shells. I shudder to think what I would look like after eating 48 cannoli. 

The step which explains draining the ricotta is imperative. On the first batch I did not do that and the filling tended to fall out of the shells. Now I know. 

One thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of vanilla to the filling. It came out like a vanilla milkshake that you could eat with a fork! I also did not use the lemon zest. I don't think it needs it.

Great recipe.  Easy to follow and it came out great.   I did add another 1/2 cup confectioner sugar  to the filling to make it a bit sweeter and along with the chocolate chips I added pestachio pieces. Also I used regular marsala wine because I could not find the sweet marsala wine but it still came out wonderful.  I will never buy store bought again.

The recipe for the shells was easy to  follow.  Definitely use Marsala wine as one of the other reviewers recommended.  I did not follow the recipe for filling.  I prefer a lighter filling so I folded in 1/2 cup fresh whipped cream.   I experiment with fillings.  This year, I added mint extract and a few drops of green food coloring and decorated the ends with crushed Andes mints for one batch and used raspberry extract with red  food color  and chocolate chips for the other batch.  Beautiful presentation!

The area I live in does not carry the cannoli tubes for sale, nor the premade shells. What I did was make a pattern from paper (4.5" circle) & cut disposable aluminum pans into very wide strips & rolled them up, then wrapped the paper circle around to check the diameter of the tube was right. I split the dough into 1/3, then each third in half & from each half of that I made 5 dough balls (for a total of 30 balls). I did use a rolling pin & got them to size, wrapped around the aluminum tube, egg wash, put the other side on top, then egg washed it closed. Had zero problems with them busting open. I've got them stored (after frying & draining the oil on paper towels) & will fill them after lunch Christmas Day. It was very time consuming, but the end result was well worth it: shells taste perfect. I'm sure the filling will be equally tasty. Thank you for sharing!

Basic recipe. Couple of hints. If you use regular ricotta, make sure it's drained thoroughly, at least overnight. If you can find Impastata ricotta that's even better. Much creamier,  and drier. I also used 2 Tbsp of heavy cream, and orange zest in place of lemon. All in all a decent recipe.

We made these cannoli the old fashioned way - Rolled with rolling pin and fried in cast iron pan wrapped around a thin, wooden rolling pin (can also use a non-varnished broom handle). The flavor was phenomenal! The lemon zest adds a lot of freshness to the filling. Let the filling sit for a couple  of hours at least to let the flavors really enhance. Because we rolled them with a rolling pin, they were not as thin and some had to be re-fried (fried, taken off the form then put back in). We also noticed that the dough became a but tough after sitting at room temperature for a while, while we were making the circles. So the key is - roll as thin as you can & try not to handle the dough too much or it becomes tough! Will update review when we make it again. Thanks!

I have a great tip to to add.  I made these the nighy before,but I didn't stuff them. I put the shells in a zip lock bag overnight.  The next day, they were not crispy. They were like cardboard.  I threw them in the oven for 15-20 minutes on 350.  Perfect crispy shells.  Better than when first made.

This was my first time ever making cannoli. I don't have a pasta attachment for my mixer so I rolled it by hand. They turned out great! They taste and look delicious! I added 3/4 cup of powder sugar because I prefer a sweeter taste but didn't want to add too much since I added mini chocolate chips.

Made the cannoli filling ... Yummy ... Used pizzelle's instead (rolled on a tube while still warm right off  the machine).   Dipped the ends in Semi Sweet Bakers Chocolate ), then filled once they cooled .Much easier than trying to make shells !  Sprinkled with cocoa powder !!! Yummmm mommy

My Italian girlfriend loves Cannoli's from "Buca de bepo" Resteraunt, but it's 11$ for only 3. Don't get me wrong, they are good, but that was like 60 cents PER BITE. We made this recipe, took half of the day, but yields so many of them that not only were we set for more than a week, but we had to share with family and friends too. We did our own little twist on it, but this recipe is the bomb! If you've ever had Cannoli's, highly recommend it. If you haven't, imagine a thicker fried crepe, with a very soft crème (though not overly sweet) filling. Strongly recommend adding small chocolate chips in the filling for texture contrast.

This review is for the shells only, as I made my own filling by combining a few different recipes. The shells are spot on! This was my first time making cannoli shells, and the taste and texture are perfect. If you are familiar with making homemade pasta, you pretty much follow the same process. I used my pasta machine to smooth the dough, running it through on #2 a few times to get the correct smoothness (dusting with flour as necessary to keep it from sticking in the pasta machine). I found that the best setting for the final roll of the dough through the machine was #5. In a search for something that was the right size to cut the dough into circles, I found an upside-down margarita glass was the perfect size. I did not grease my cannoli tubes, but instead just made sure there was a light dusting of flour on the dough before rolling around the tubes. Fry time for me was about 1-1/2 minutes per side. Because this recipe makes quite a few shells, I decided to freeze some of them for future use. I just pulled some out of the freezer, and laid them on my kitchen island to defrost. I thought they might be slightly soft after defrosting, and had planned to crisp them back up in the oven, but that was not necessary. I made the shells back in November, when I made the Pumpkin Cannoli recipe (also on this site).

Excellent! I made it exactly as written except I did add a third of a cup of Marscapone and used the zest of 2 small oranges. It was a fun group activity for us to make at a dinner party.
