Needs some olive oil -- I'd make this again as an easy dinner, though.  You can definitely use other veggies too.

Pretty decent and very healthy. The only thing I did differently was to pour a little olive oil in to the baking dish, and thoroughly coat the veggies. Not bad at all. Thanks!

This was VERY yummy. Made it without the asparagus. My boys, who don't usually like Tilapia that much, and are of the pickiest ages (9 and 11), liked it!

the fish was very fishy tasting and all the vegetables tasted like carrots.  We were very disappointed after seeing the other reviews.  We will not eat this again.
