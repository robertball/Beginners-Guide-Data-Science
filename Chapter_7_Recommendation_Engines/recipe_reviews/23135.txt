These cookies are fabulous!  I did make some adjustments based on other reviews I read.  I added 1 1/2 cup oatmeal (total),1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp pumpkin spice in lieu of the cinnamon, 1 cup chopped walnuts, 1/4 zante currants, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 15oz can 100% pumpkin puree, and all brown sugar (instead of 1/2 white, & 1/2 brown).  I used a mellon baller to measure out the cookies and the total cooking time approx. 13 mins per batch.  I will make these again and again! :)

Yummy pumpkin cookies! I changed a few things...applesauce instead of butter, a little pumpkin spice, 1/2 whole wheat flour. They were very sticky so i was a little worried...but they just needed to be baked a tad longer. (11-12min) They turned out great and low in fat and high in fiber!

This is one of my all time favorite cookies. I JUST made these and I couldn't stop eating them. I do agree that they need to be cooked a bit longer, closer to 12 minutes. The only adjustments I made was to omit the raisins and adding 2 TBSP of ground flax seed. I LOVE the flavor flax provides not to mention the added protein and other benefits. I think next time, I will try to make a healthier version using more oats and applesauce instead of oil. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I believe it will become a family tradition in my home.

I, like other reviewers, used applesauce instead of butter. I also added pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon to add something extra. The only thing I had to change was the cooking time. I had to keep them in the oven for at least 14 minutes. The two batches that were in for 12 minutes were more like muffin tops in texture which may be great if you want them like that. If you want a more cookie texture, add baking time. The recipe was very tasty despite the muffin consitency and made my house smell great!

Absolutely awesome.  They were a little cakey, but in a really good way. ADD EXTRA CINNAMON, or better yet, some PUMPKIN PIE SPICE . . they are incredibly good.  We can see how some people would want to increase the baking time, but we like cookies slightly underdone, so this was perfect.

will make these again but will add some more spices. I used applesauce instead of butter and also cooked on parchment paper. I had to peel them off but they taste great.

These are great cookies!!  I didn't have raisins or chocolate chips, so used the sliced almonds I had in the cupboard.  I also used 1/3 less sugar, as I often do to reduce calories, and they were still great.  Kids love them!

These had really good flavor, but I was hoping for something a little more dense. They are more cake like. Which is not bad, but not what I was looking for.

I really liked these cookies.  The only change I made was to use chocolate chips instead of raisins, which was yummy!  I like the more cake-like texture of these cookies, and they came out very moist.  Thanks.

I love when I find a recipe that I can make pretty healthy, thats still delish! These are thick and moist, but don't know if thats due to some changes? I used whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of butter, 1/4 c white sugar instead of 1/2 c.. but still put in choc chips :) Added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg, heaping tsp ground flax seed and used 1 tsp cin insread of 1/2.. very good, enough so that I made them last night, they are gone.. and I just pulled more out of the oven just now.. (you know, cause I had to use the rest of the remaining canned pumpkin, ha!)

These are even better than I thought they would be. We don't like raisins, so we used dried cranberries. I can really taste the vanilla as well as the cinnamon. We found they needed to bake a little longer.

These are really good but very odd at the same time! I added a cup of pumpkin instead of half. And white chocolate chips that melted wonderfully. Also added more cinnamon, pumpkin spice, and nutmeg. They came out very good!! The texture was one that I have never experienced for a cookie before!! Awesome!!  I can't figure out how to submit a new review, so I'll add it to this one! I've made these cookies 3 times now and had to double the recipe. First with the white chocolate chips; delish, then with the raisins; great, and finally the most recent I diced up some fresh apples from my grandmothers apple tree. Sounds weird at first, but they melded wonderfully and had superb flavor!! Thanks again!

I followed this recipe to the tee and the "cookies" were more like bread, they were very soft and fluffy. This is not my idea of a good cookie. The flavor was good, but the texture and consistency was not to my liking.

I love oatmeal raisin cookies and this was such a good modification on that type of recipe!  It was delicious!  I might not use so much butter next time.

These cookies are light and airy and definitely not too sweet to the taste. Overall the flavor is lovely which is what gets it a high rating. The problem with this is that there definitely needs to be more oatmeal and I used 1 whole teaspoon of cinnamon. I estimate total will be about three cups of oatmeal altogether. The big adjustment in the oatmeal is why I only rate it three stars. Other than that it is a fine recipes and I will definitely make it again.

I cooked some fresh pumpkin tonight and decided to give this recipe a try.  Its not a very sweet cookie, and it does take 15 minutes to bake, but overall, I thought it was pretty good. The oatmeal gave it a nice texture. I sprayed the air bake cookie sheet with pam since it looked like a cake type of cookie and they slid right off.  This recipe is a little light on spices so you might give an extra 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  i will make again, but tinker with it.

I made these for my son's school.  I loved them - they were soft, chewy, not the least bit rubbery.  I made them plain, with raisins and with chocolate chips.  

I also used the serving conversion to take it to 100 servings, instead of 24.  It turned out great.  They spread nicely, and had a smooth surface like a regular cookie, rather than a bumpy surface as shown in the photo, or like some cake-like cookies tend to have.

YUM!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, except using pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and mini chocolate chips in place of the raisins.  At first, I was kind of disappointed.  The cookies were difficult to remove from the cookie pans, even though I used silpat mats and let them cool.  They were sticky and the texture wasn't great, although they tasted pretty good.  Since I'd doubled the recipe, I had a lot of dough that I put into the fridge to bake later.  Well, the next couple of trays of cookies turned out much better.  The trick was to bake them quite a bit longer than the recipe stated.  Instead of 10 minutes, I baked them for 14 or 15 minutes, until they turned a nice golden brown.  Not only were the cookies much easier to handle, the texture was better.  A bit crisp around the edge but chewy on the inside.   Still not the best pumpkin cookie I've tried, but much better when baked properly.

I didn't follow this carefully and they were awesome - chewy and sweet and good. I used all brown sugar, a healthy butter alternative (1/3 cup) added 1 cup of pumpkin, lots of extra oats, and a tsp of baking powder. Plus I used mixed spice instead of cinnamon. bake fifteen minutes for sure.

These cookies tasted more like regular Oatmeal cookies. Not enough pumpkin flavor.  Also the cookie texture was more bread like. A soft cookie mainly.  Still, it tasted good.  Next time, I'll add more pumpkin puree to the mix.

So moist. They stay moist for days. The second time I made them, I used golden raisins, which gave them a slightly different yet still good flavor. Everyone loved these cookies.

I can't decide whether or not I liked these "cookies".  Like other reviews said, they are more of a muffin top rather than a cookie.  I used organic apple cinnamon oatmeal instead of regular rolled oats, and used applesauce instead of butter.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe exactly (minus the raisins... don't like raisins).  I also left them in the oven for 12 minutes rather than 10.  Maybe they would taste better with some walnuts or something.

A pretty decent recipe, but nothing to write home about. A little too dense for me, without being rich or moist and chewy. I like the simplicity of the recipe and am always looking for ways to use the cooked pumpkin I make in the fall, but this one lacks glamour.

These are okay.  They definitely need more cooking time (I did mine 18 minutes and they still were kind of "pumpkin pie" like in the centre")    The kids like them, which is the only reason it gets 3 stars.  I would have given it 1 myself.

I used applesauce instead of butter, more oatmeal (about 3/4c) and added craisins and walnuts.  Added ground cloves and nutmeg along with the cinnamon.  These are awesome---a quick, very low fat treat.  My husband likes one for breakfast with his yogurt!

These cookies were awesome!  My husband and son both loved them.  I did make some substitutions based on other reviews and my own preferences.  I used 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup of the splenda brown sugar mix to cut down on sugar.  I increased or added ingredients, using 1 cup of oats, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a 15 oz. can of pumpkin.  You'll need to cook these longer due to the increase in moisture from the pumpkin.  I cooked them for 15-17 minutes.  They will not turn out dense, but rather like a light cake consistancy.  Good luck and enjoy!

I needed about 1 cup of extra flour.  Also, the cookies needed about 19 minutes in the oven.  I am not sure if this is because I baked them on stoneware rather than metal pans.  They were nice and chewy and had a great flavor, once i figured out the adjustments.

These were excellent!  I did not have quick cooking oats, so I used old fashioned rolled oats.  I may try 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 butter the next time.  My 2-year old loved them and kept asking for more.

So good! I used about 3/4 cup of caramel chips instead of raisins and added about 1/4 tsp of ginger and nutmeg. I also added about 1/4 tsp more of cinnamon. I highly suggest this recipe.

I added 1/2 cup more flour and 1 cup more oats. They were good, but not very pumpkin tasting. And I baked them for 18 minutes before they were done enough to lift off the baking tray. All in all a good cake-like cookie.

These cookies are good, I just wouldn't call them cookies. They are definitely more cake/muffin like. Still good, I just wouldn't call them cookies. The only change I made was to add some pumpkin pie spice and to add bake time.

I found this recipe years ago from a little halloween idea book in the checkout line. It was such a hit, but then I then lost the recipe. I was so happy when I found it on here! The only changes I make are the use of chocolate chips instead of raisins and I use vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla extract.  It makes for a much richer taste, I feel, but can be hard to find. Thanks for posting this!  It is such a delicious cookie and seems to be my signature dessert.  I'm always asked for the recipe...I should probably stop giving it out as to retain my culinary advantage ;)

These had a very nice flavor! I used walnuts instead of raisins because that's what I had on hand and they added a nice crunch. I'd like to try to chocolate chips too.

I struggled with the choice between four stars or five, and opted for four only because I hold five star recipes to an extremely high standard and dont give that away lightly.  Anyway, first I should confess that I do not like pumpkin.  I chose to make these cookies in the spirit of Thanksgiving, expecting to skip over them for some apple pie at dessert time.  BUT, when other pumpkin haters started gobbling them up, I gave in and tried them. Yum !  I was pleasantly surprised.  
The only problem I had was the cook time.  I took them out after 11 minutes and let them cool, only to realize that they were not done.  So I put them back in for a bit and I still think they could have cooked longer.  Very gooey. Could be my oven I 'spose. 
The oatmeal texture in a gooey cookie takes some warming up to, since they are so cakelike. But I did end up eating about 6, so I guess it's easy to overlook!

These were super easy to make. I agree, a little bland but I added nutmeg and double the oats. Chocolate chips instead of raisins. Conf. sugar on top of course.

I've been making these for the past few years....today I doubled the recipe....except for the pumpkin. Instead I added 1/2 c pumpkin, and 1/2 c carrot puree (had some from the purees i've been making from my deceptively delicious cookbook!~great). I also chopped up an apple (pink lady....they are nice and tart for baking).( I always add nutmeg as well, and sometime substitute some of the butter with applesauce.) They came out fantastic!

Very good! I did double the recipe and added walnuts and half a bag of choc chips and subbed craisins for raisins. 

(Hint regardless if you use raisins or craisins in baking soak them in a bit of orange liquor or juice and water for at least an hour so they get nice and plump.)

Next time I think I'd do double the oatmeal too. But they are awesome! Everyone loved them.

These were very good! I like most of the reviews changed the recipe a bit to fit what I thought would work. I added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and extra oatmeal and pumpkin. I, however, did not find that the dough was too soft, I found it to be the perfect cookie dough consistency. This will be another keeper recipe for me.

These are delicious. I've made them twice. The second time was for my four-year-old son's "snack day" at his pre-school. The kids and teachers loved them! I used golden raisins so they would blend in because my kids say they don't like raisins. But they gobbled these cookies up. This is a great recipe!

Great cookies, though I'll add more oats next time around.  I put in a liberal amount of dried cranberries and chopped walnuts in lieu or the raisins.  The cranberries were an excellent match for this cookie, and the walnuts gave it just the right amount of crunch.

Great texture; excellent balance between sweetness and spices.  In addition to butterscotch chips, I also throw in a cup of chipped walnuts.  Last, I make two substitutions:  Whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and half & half Splenda instead of the sugars.  Rave!

Good recipe.  To make it healthier I used whole wheat flour.  I also substituted Craisens for Raisens.  Really Yummy!

This is an excellent cookie. Based on what others said, I used 1 cup of oats and baked a little longer. A terrific tasting cake like cookie that will hold up well in a lunch box or cookie jar. I also used chocolate chips but I think raisins would be equally delicious.

Great fall cookies (or any time of the year for that matter!) These turned out perfectly! I added chocolate chips instead of raisins and an extra 1/4 c. of pumpkin and an extra 1/4 c. of oatmeal. 10 minutes of baking worked fine with my oven, plus I didn't make the cookies very big. Delicious cookies...taste just like a bite-size piece of pumpkin bread!

Good recipe! I love pumpkin.  When I made these cookies, they took a long time to bake, around 15 mins/batch.  And I would suggest using sweetened pumpkin or adding more brown sugar.  Vanilla icing and candycorn topping made these really cute!

Very good cookies, though they were more cake-like than I was hoping. I replaced the white sugar with Splenda and the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, and no one was the wiser. I also added a little extra cinnamon and a dash each of allspice, nutmeg, ground cloves, and ginger. Instead of raisins, I used white chocolate chips, which was divine! I too had to cook longer than called for -- about 13 to 14 minutes -- but I think I made the cookies bigger than the recipe intended.

THese were great! They are chewy but are also very soft. My granddaughters who are cookie freaks, devoured these in a flash. As for the adults, these are very pleasing and are only "2 Points" on one of the popular weight control 
programs.

This is a very tasty recipe, really soft and cake-like rather than "chewy" to me.  I substituted some whole-wheat flour for the white flour and added some wheat germ (I figured I would try to balance out all the butter and sugar with some more "healthy" stuff).  I would consider lowering the butter content by substituting applesauce next time, but I didn't want to make too many changes at once.  They do need to cook longer than 10 minutes, but they mixed up very quickly and are easy enough.  A nice treat for my son's kindergarten class after a trip to the pumpkin patch!

The batter was too thin for scooping up for cookies, so I added about 1/2 cup to a double batch. Then the taste was kind of blah, so I added some pumpkin pie spice.  Then they came out good. I would recommend a bit more oatmeal maybe to help thicken it up some too.

These are really good, soft cookies!  I followed the dough directions exactly then added cinnamon chips and chopped walnuts instead of raisins.  I really liked that combo!  Baked them for 12 min. (in a convection oven on insulated sheets).

I'm giving this 2 stars only because they tasted delicious. The problem I had was that mine never rose. I even tested my baking soda after the fact to see if that was the problem, but it still had plenty of potency.  Seems that there should be something acidic in the recipe to help the soda to react, but no one else mentioned this... I followed the recipe exactly so not sure why it didn't turn out. I also had a lot of trouble removing them from the pan so after the firt batch I gressed the pan with slightly better results.

NOT cookies!  As I was spooning onto a cookie sheet, I was thinking I should be pouring this cake batter into a cake or loaf pan.  Quantities are way wrong on this.

These are really nice moist soft cookies. Nice and cinnamon-y, and just the right sweetness. I put in craisins, since I didn't have any regular raisins. It's delish!  I should add that they should be cooked longer than stated on the recipe.  I think I cooked them for an extra ten minutes.

This was ok.  I needed to make a pumpkin pie and only had the 29oz can.  Left over pumpkin lead me to this recipe.  I used about 1 1/2 cup pumpkin and added pumpkin pie spice along with having to use silken tofu for the egg, added toasted pecans and dark chocolate chips.  I also cut 1/2 the butter and used flaxmeal.  They were just too cakey, was too soft.  I liked the flavor.  I am not sure if it was the tofu I had to use or not.  I might try again using egg next time.  I added extra oatmeal to the last batch and that helped a ton!  Still soft but more firm than gooey.

It was raining this morning, and the fall weather really started to hit. I was craving something pumpkin! These cookies were SO GOOD--very moist and melt-in-your-mouth! Now, I'm not a fan of raisins, so I added 1/2c of chocolate chips instead... I only added 1/2c instead of 1c because I was afraid the melted chocolate would overpower the pumpkin flavor. I'll definitely be making these even when fall is over!

I made these and made a few adjustments... Stevia instead of sugar, applesauce instead of butter & pumkin spice.  The dough was way sticky so I added 1/4c oats & flour.  Overall, they turned out good.  Next time I would add more pumpkin, for greater flavor.

Delicious! I already have to make another batch with my leftover pumpkin. With all the comments on the cookies being more like cake, I decided to bake as mini-muffins, which worked perfectly. Here are the changes I made for these delicious mini-muffins: 1/2 c raisins and 1/2 c chopped walnuts instead of the 1 c raisins, used 1 t vanilla instead of just 1/2 t, and added 1/4 t maple extract, used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, however I sprinkled a tad of cinnamon in for good measure when I was mixing in the dry ingredients. These are great to have around for the fall season and didn't end up being too sweet even with my alterations. Baking time increased to about 13-15 mns using toothpick method. Thanks!

This is an excellent cake cookie.  Lot's of flavour.  I added a bit more cinnamon but then I usually do when called for.  I would add walnuts next time but didn't have them on hand.

I thought these were just OK.  I'd like more pumpkin flavor and more spices.

These weren't completely horrible. I did make some adjustments so I hesitate to give these less than 3 stars because the problems may have been in my adjustments. But I thought they were dry and rather tasteless. Not inedible, but just bland. I will try these again, sometime and stick to the recipe and edit my review at that time.

I made this cookies recently and they came out great. I used choclate chips instead of raisons and they came out moist and delicious. Not too much pumpkin flavor but enough. Easy to make.

I found these cookies to be fairly bland and too cake-like for my taste. However, I did make a number of changes based on other reviews: I added an extra 1/2 cup of oats and 1/2 cup of flour, applesauce instead of butter, chocolate chips instead of raisins, and 1/3 tsp each of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and ground cloves. The spices added a nice flavor, but I still found them too bland. Maybe I should have stuck to the recipe better.

This is a great recipe for what it's meant to be: a light, fluffy cookie. Yeah, it's kind of cake-like. Who doesn't like cake?!? The only thing I would suggest is to DOUBLE THE RECIPE. One batch doesn't make a whole lot of cookies. They'll be gone in a couple minutes if you take them to a party.

Added extra oats, ginger, chocolate chips, and cooked for 16 minutes.  The cookies still fell apart when I tried to pick them up.  They don't taste that fantastic, either.  When you have to alter the recipe so much in order to get something edible, you're not using the same recipe anymore.  I won't be making these again.

I followed this recipe to the "T" and my cookies took too long to bake, and they came out more like cake than cookies. I would recommend this recipe for muffins or bread, but add more pumpkin to the mix. Although sort of bland my husband loved them, but then he loves sweets in general.

I doubled this recipe, since I make my cookies a little larger and prefer to make bigger batches (so they last longer than  two days!). I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and cinnamon chips for the raisins. Delicious - a perfect cookie for fall!

Following other reviewers, I used 1.5 cups of oatmeal, a full can of pumpkin,  and oodles of spices (Nutmeg / Cinnamon / Ginger / All-Spice / Cloves, etc).  The dough was HORRIBLY sticky and a bit loose, so I ended up adding more flour (about 3/4 cup more) and more oats (about a half cup) - still unbearably sticky.  
 
Due to the increased flour, they were pretty 'floury' - but still had a nice flavor.  I bet they'd be WAY Better with the raisins...I had to top these with cream cheese frosting to help with presentation.  Not the prettiest cookie I've seen.

The folks at work loved these! I thought the cookies were a little bland so I drizzled them with a standard powdered sugar/milk/vanilla extract icing. I also didn't have any raisins, so I used a cup of chopped walnuts instead. I had to bake them for 16 minutes in my oven.

I followed the recipe exactly, aside from adding some more spices, and the cookie dough came out more like batter.  This resulted in a very soft cake like cookie.  I brought them into work and they were devoured.

I liked these cookies better than my husband.  I added more oats and spices as per other readers and made them into bar cookies (no time for regular cookies).  I really enjoyed the flavor and I added craisins and white chocolate chips!

Delicious cookies!  I followed the others' advice and added LOTS more spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice),extra oatmeal and flour, choc chips, and walnuts.  I doubled the recipe and had no problems. I also sprayed the pan with oil.

These were really good. I like that they had oats in them. I used half whole wheat flour, about 1/2c walnuts and 1/2 cup cinnamon chips instead of the raisins. The kids liked the iced pumpkin cookies better. I think these were great, maybe I'll drizzle icing on these as well next time.

These cookies were delicious.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of the white sugar.  I also used chocolate chips.  I may have made them bigger because I had to bake them longer than ther recipe said, about 15 minutes.

Very nice cookies.  Agree with the others that they need longer to bake, more toward 15 minutes.  I prefer the flavor of them after they have cooled completely.  You know how we are always in a hurry to take a cookie warm from the oven?  Well, these ones taste better cold - the sweet pumpkin flavor comes through a lot better.

For some reason, I just got done making this and it didn't come out.   The cookies were not done all the way through.  I left them in the oven longer than it said also.  It's not my oven since I made a batch of Peanut Butter before that and they were beautiful...

I also had to bake these cookies closer to 15 minutes than 10. You have to see the ungreased cookie sheet so they cook on the bottom. My first two batches were on foil and very crumbly until I removed the foil and cooked them on the cookie sheet. They turned out great though, quite delicious.

I added chocolate chips instead of raisins, and instead of plain quick oats, I used a packet of cinnamon and spice instant oatmeal. I brought them to a baby shower and everyone loved them. They are very moist and the spices are great. I will definitely make these again.

Excellent!  Very easy and delicious.  I had to bake for about 12 minutes on my air-bake cookie sheet.  I used raisins and added some chopped nuts, and a dash each of nutmeg, cloves, and ginger.  I'm sure I'll be baking these again soon.

I used raisins and they turned out delicious. I did have to leave them in the oven for an extra few minutes because they didn't look done. I also substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour (a bit more nutritious). My boys all loved them!
