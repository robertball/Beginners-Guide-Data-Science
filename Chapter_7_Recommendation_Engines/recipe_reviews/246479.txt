Stevia measurements differ from brand to brand, so I made mine according to how sweet I like my drinks. This hot chocolate was ok, but it was a little weak. Next time, I will add another teaspoon of the cacao powder to make it "chocolatier." This is a good base recipe for people to adjust according to their diet, perhaps using almond or soy milk. I did like the flavor the cinnamon gave to it.
