I would like to say that I love to bake and love fudge. That being said, I was a fudge virgin and had never made it before. The author of he recipe negated to disclose how high do you heat the fudge? I boiled for 5 minutes on high, and my fudge burnt. I am sure, that had I known you do not cook fudge on high on the stove, that this recipe would have turned out. This information should have been disclosed in the cooking instuctions. The rsult: an 8"x8" dark brown brick(not kidding, I could not even score the surface with a knife)

This recipe has eluded me for years. My mom made it for years and lost it! This is exactly what I was looking for. I agree with the member who boiled it for 10 minutes and stirred for 5 minutes. Turns out perfectly. Just like I remember!!

This recipe turns out great every time.  You need to use a timer.  DO NOT just guess.  If you want to be even more precise, you need to use a candy thermometer and boil the mixture to 238 F.  Soft ball stage.  If you use a thermometer, you don't need to time it.  :)  I use less confectioners sugar - more like 1.25 cups.

I have been making different types of fudge religiously for 20+ years and swear by the importance of a candy thermometer.  Despite the fact that this fudge came out runny-ish-despite using a candy thermometer  at soft ball stage and freezing for several hours-- the taste was insanely amazing.  Like the most perfect taste ever. I am totally making this again; however, the next time I make it, I will make the following adjustments: A. Don't boil it on high high heat and B. cook it until I hit between soft and hard ball stage on the thermometer- I think because there is so much butter in this, it sets different than any other fudge that I have ever made.  As an additional note, after setting for an hour or so-- it could be the most perfect frosting ever.  Two other modifications that I made to put it over the top, instead of the total amount of conf sugar, I added half a cup of marshmallow and a cup of conf sugar.  This gave it a creamier appearance and less sicky sweet. Lastly, I added a few dashes of sea salt and chopped Heath bar on top- the flavors matched the fudge perfectly.  This is a great recipe, the cooking is tricky as it is with fudge generally.

This turned out perfectly! I used to make a similar fudge a long time ago, but had lost my recipe. This was a little different, as I know I never used confectioner's sugar. The recipe is simple and the timing directions are easier than temperature testing or soft-ball judging. I followed the directions exactly and used the fudge and a gift to my sister, who used to make brown sugar fudge with me.

Excellent tasting and very easy to make.I've made 6 batches in the last 24 hours to give away to co-workers. I did struggle to make the 1 inch cubes retain their shape when putting in gift boxes.     After trying to cut it at room temp, at semi-chilled and totally refridgerated- I concluded that the fudge cubes turned out perfect-shaped when 100% refridgerated. Note: they were very hard to carve at 35 degrees so please be careful with the knife! Just go slow!

We made this exactly as stated and it was crumbly, couldn't cut it into squares.  Taste was ok but consistency was awful.

After following the directions which didn't sound right to me to start with I now have a pot of sugar not fudge . I boiled the brown sugar 10 min and should have stopped right there. Adding confectioners sugar and beating for five min turned it all back to a much sweeter brown sugar in a granulated form.

Came out smooth and creamy. I used a heavy enameled pot and boiled It on low heat as I believe those who had a problem must have cooked it to hot.

This was perfect!
I made one little change and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I did find that my fudge fell apart when I cut it.  Any ideas what I did wrong?  It still taste delicious!!!!

Easy and yummy. I used organic whole milk instead of evaporated. Instead of nuts,  I  sprinkled the top with crushed pretzels and drizzled melted white chocolate over the top. Woah, tastes like salty carmel-y heaven!

Mine is not cooled yet but I can tell it will be exactly what I have been looking for (I make other fudge a lot so I can tell it will firm nicely and I tasted it and the flavor is perfect).  
When I used to work in restaurants, the cooks made this fudge quite often. I had not been able to find any like it until now.  I had been looking in Latin stores, etc... I thought it was called Mexican Fudge but the kind I found at Latin stores/markets just hasn't been very good to me.  Trader Joe's sells something similar and they call it English Butter Fudge (it is delicious!!).
All I did differently from this recipe was stir some vanilla into it by hand after I mixed it with hand mixer because I am a vanilla fanatic!  I read others' reviews so what I also did was time it and use a thermometer.  After 10 minutes it had not reached the normal soft ball temp per my candy thermometer so I cooked it a tad bit longer to make sure it would not be too soft.  It never reached the desired temp.  Also, I made sure it didn't boil really hard, kept it at a lower to medium-ish  boil and stirred once in a while - don't think it needed the stirs though. I beat it exactly 5 mins. with hand mixer.  I did not use any walnuts because my husband doesn't like them and the cooks never added them either.
A TIP: 
I always line my pans with foil and then butter the foil - makes it so much easier to get out (I take it out in one whole piece) and cut up. And you also don't scratch your pans by cutting it in them

Made this exactly as the recipe said to and everyone I gave it to said this was the best fudge they ever had! I think the key is to let the fudge come to a boil and lower heat so its still gently boiling but not to let the temperature get too high.

The fudge had a good flavour.  However, the reason the texture is not creamy for some is, more than likely, the fact that using a high-speed mixer such as a Kitchen-Aid, beats it at twice the speed as other mixers.  So, either beat by hand once the icing sugar is added or beat for less time than suggested.  Unfortunately, most of mine will be a topping on ice cream as it is crumbly and very dry.  I should have followed my instinct when I saw that it was ready to put into the pan. . . . . using the Kitchen-Aid only took 2 minutes to reach this point.  I will definitely try this again!  Thank you

I've made this a couple of times and it works well- the only thing I would add is a pinch of salt and a tsp of vanilla, both stirred in at the end.

I think I cooked boiled the mix slightly too long or at too high a temperature, but I'm glad I did, because it came out as Toffee-Flavored Fudge!

I also substituted half a jar of marshmallow fluff for the confectioner's sugar.

Can't get enough of this melt-in-the-mouth treat now.

Will make again. 2nd batch peanut butter.
Both batches appear slightly darker than in photo.
One star off only because of difficulty in boiled sugar fudges. 

Peanut fudge:  Used that huge 30oz container PBfit from bulk store. NOTE-It's so potent I'm still looking for other uses!
1Tbls PB POWDER (measure) in saucepan. 2 Tbls in PB powder in confectioner sugar. Also add 1-1.5 tsp of cocoa to sugar (yes powdered PB is that potent). 
Also put "glaze" on top: 1/2c confectioner sugar+2tsp coffee+caramel+milk (1tsp-Tbls, varies) Can use ice cream topping. Stir by hand to thick, pourable glaze. Add after getting fudge set in pan. I used 1/2tsp PB powder in lieu of caramel there. 

For fancy, "precut" fudge while warm after adding glaze top (this 'trick' works for many things.) Glaze makes it look like in photo. 

==>For any, any fudge virgins or newbies, add 2 marshmallows per 8^8 or 4-8 small marshmallows into saucepan Just Before mixing with confectioner sugar-stir briefly but the marshmallows don't need to totally dissolve. No matter how you under-over cooked it, the fudge will stick together. 

One other tip: use super-strong coffee or coffee crystals in fudge-in this style 1-2 tsp (liquid)in confectioner sugar NOT the boiled sugar. In lieu of vanilla in other recipes.

This recipe is EXACTLY right with 10 min soft-slow boil. But that's after everything is melted together. Also, I'm using a gas stove-electric cooking may take closer to

This is a nice, creamy fudge.  It does not make very much, which is good for the two of us.  If there are more of you, you will want to double it. One thing I found different, was adding salt. Next time I make this I'll leave the salt out.  I find it gives a "biting" taste that does not taste good...although I can certainly taste the rest of the ingredients. I used beaters to beat the fudge and it doesn't take long at all to thicken.

Mine turned into a brick of sugar. I followed exactly. I brought to a boil, then continued to boil for 10 mins. I think that's where it went wrong but that's what it said to do.

Very easy Penuche fudge! If you are a caramel, candy, or fudge novice this recipe might not have turned out as expected. When it doubt use a thermometer to get as close to 238F as possible. This won’t turn out as expected if over or under done. If you done have a thermometer keep that note it mind. It you don’t have one and still want to make this two things are important to do. 1. Keep heat in a low high to medium low range, never high. It just won’t work. 2. Once it comes to a solid boil, but not too hard, reduce heat it it boils too hard, you should leave it alone and let it boil lightly rolling for 5 minutes without stirring. I also recommend a pan with parchment or wax paper to set up and set it completely in the fridge.  Also- if you use skim or 1% milk it may not set well. They do not have enough fat content to set properly.

I put the butter into a metal pot first, and melted it on low heat without browning it.  I used Cabot's salted butter, for whatever that is worth.  Then I turned off the heat and stirred in the evaporated milk.  Then I stirred in the brown sugar.  Then I brought the mixture to a boil, and turned down the heat as low as I could to keep it boiling, stirring off and on with a metal spatula.  After 10 minutes, I took it off the heat, and added confectioner's sugar which included cornstarch according to the package.  Then I beat as fast as my mixer could go for 5 minutes, then took the advice and added more chopped walnuts than the recipe called for.  I stirred them in with the beater on low.  I poured the mixture into a pan and left it at room temperature to set.  I may need to put it somewhere colder.

I have never made, nor have I heard of brown sugar fudge. I was very interested when I read the recipe. I read the comments before I began. I decided to follow the recipe exactly as written. I boiled for 10 minutes, and mixed for 5 minutes. 

By the time it was finished mixing it was looking dry. I have 2 reasons for this: 1) Maybe the recipe 's 2 cups of powdered sugar is too much. One person said she cut it down to 1 1/2 cups.  2) I did not want to use my mixer in my pot. So I put the powdered sugar in my mixing bowl and poured the boiling mixture into it. Then I put the bowl in my stand mixer for 5 minutes. Perhaps the fact that the bowl was not hot caused the mixture to cool too fast. 

The result was dry crumbly fudge. The taste is good, but very sweet. Maybe cutting the powdered sugar is the next reasonable step.

I followed the instructions to the letter and was crushed when I had a bowl of dry grainy sugary stuff at the end.  I don't think you can really trust things like fudge by simply timing them.  I think you need to use a candy thermometer and wait until soft ball stage.

This was a delicious treat.  However, next time I will cut back on the 5 minute blending time.  It seemed to change the consistency for the worse blending for that long and it became less of a fudge consistency and more hard and crumbly.

I have never made fudge before in my life and fully expected to mess this up my first try. But I went in with a candy thermometer and a timer (just to make extra sure) and this fudge turned out awesome.

Best brown sugar fudge that I've ever made - very creamy.  I did not use confectionery sugar - instead  used 1-2 cups of marshmallow fluff.  Rather than time as specified, I used a candy thermometer.  Delicious!!!!

I found this recipe because I had planned to make Maple Walnut fudge and couldn't find maple extract anywhere.  So I found this.  My first batch came out far to soft.  The second batch came out so hard it was brutal to cut.  But it was sooooo delicous.  Melt-in-your-mouth delicious.
