I thought this was very delicious. The only change I made was instead of using sea salt I  used garlic salt. It turned out great.

Made this using a simple box grater (slicer side) so the slices were pretty thin. I put them in a bag and tossed with a little more olive oil than stated. I sprayed an insulated, airbake cookie sheet with nonstick (just to be safe) and spread them out well. I saved the salt to apply after cooking. They turned out perfect at the stated time and temperature. No burning.

Fabulous!  Can't wait for more to come out of the oven.  I used garlic salt in place of salt and watched carefully to avoid burning.  I put the thinner slices on one tray and those that came out thicker on another so I could take the thin ones out first. Thanks for the recipe and something different to do with all my zucchini.

This is the first time successfully had a crisp zucchini chip.  That being said, even though they appeared to be the same thickness, some were burnt, and some were tender.  So maybe the trick is making sure the olive oil is more evenly coated.  Of course there could be oven hot spots - who knows!  I'll try it again though!

Most of mine burned, and the few that did not burn, were chewy.  If I do try this again, I will lower the temperature for a longer duration of cooking time.

This was really good!  I found them a little too salty.  Next time I’ll put about half of the amount.  They were easy to make.

I tried it at this temperature and then at a much higher temperature, and they still would not crisp up. Mushy and wet is what I got. I'm going to buy an air fryer and see if that helps.

As suggested I added garlic powder rather than salt and then a little sea salt. I threw in some asparagus I had  and they both turned out wonderfully. Mine did not get crispy but it was still delicious. Sorry I ate it before I saw that I needed to write a review therefore no picture.

They were good, but not chips. Despite slicing them thin they were all soggy or had to be burnt to get crispy. I used parchment paper so nothing stuck to the trays. Nice as a side dish not for dipping.

I turned them over after 20 minutes as they were not done. I added an additional 20 minutes but they are still soggy. They taste good though.

I did not have the garlic olive oil to use. I did mixed instead oil with garlic seasoning and lemon/pepper seasoning as well. It gave a wonderful flavor then I spread the mixed with the brush in the bottom of the glass tray and afterwards on the top of the zucchini slides.

Tasted great, first time making these! Definitely should have cooked them longer, I guess I had thick slices. Next time I’ll try adding five minutes or so.

I did not care for this recipe. Mine were completely burnt in 18 minutes following the recipe exactly, with thin-sliced zucchini done on a mandolin.

Absolutely delicious! I made it with just run of the mill olive oil and a generous amount of salt and it was superb! Great for a low calorie snack.
