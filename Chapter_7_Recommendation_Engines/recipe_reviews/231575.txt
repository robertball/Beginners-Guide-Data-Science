This of COURSE was A W E S O M E !!!! I had walnuts in the freezer so I beat then up with a hammer and tossed them in the pudding pool. I was out of milk so I used about 1/4 of vanilla creamer. To be honest with you,1 cup of milk would have made this too soupy. JMO;) I liked the addition of cream cheese, it gave the salad a creamier texture, a little something special! Thank you SusieQ, this is a keeper that I'll be making again!;

Delicious! Great summertime treat for when its too hot to bake. I read other similar recipes but went with this one because of the cream cheese which is absent from most other recipes. I think it's a winner.

The only 2 things I did differently is I added the cool whip by folding it in to the cream cheese and milk and pudding.  My husband will like this.
