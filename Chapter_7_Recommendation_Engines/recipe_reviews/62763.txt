Excellent recipe--but I don't know that I would've given it 5 stars without the addition of 1 can each of black and garbanzo beans.  It needed a little more "body" and the beans were just the thing. Probably a can of corn in place of one of the beans would've worked well also.  The spices were perfect--however, I always like a touch of sweetness to tomato based recipes, so I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar....YUM! I would highly recommend this chili recipe---and for anyone that never usually tries ground turkey in place of ground beef, believe me, you'll never miss it.

Winner of the office Chili Cook-off.  I add a couple garlic cloves and lots of Chipolte Tabasco Saaas.  Toss in some Chili Powder (1 tsp+) if you are feeling crazy.  Once the meat is browned, toss everything in the slow cooker for 4 hrs on High.  Go for the gold!

I was nervous about adding taco seasoning to a chili recipe. I like to add the spices myself. But I went with the recipe and it was surprisingly fantastic. My only change, based on other reviews, was to add a can of black beans, kidney beans and cannellini beans to the chili; the chili wasn't soupy and the three bean colors gave texture and color.

I thought this was wonderful.  I have an aversion to zucchini so I left that out and added a can of kidney beans when the chili was almost done.  That's just personal preference. I also like a little more spice so I added a teaspoon of chili powder. Thanks!

This is an unusual recipe that really packs a "zing" to it! I was hesitant to try a recipe using ground turkey, but I certainly can't taste the difference. A real winner & one I'll make again, for sure!

What a great way to warm up on a cold night! We like our chili with beans, so I added a can of kidney and pinto beans. We also like our chili very spicy, so I added chili powder and a minced jalapeno. The salsa I used was spicy, too. I really liked the zucchini in this! I browned the turkey then threw everything into the slow cooker for 5 hours on high. I added some cornstarch after a few hours because the chili was too runny for me. Next time I will add more vegetables, because I like it really chunky.

What a great recipe!!  I wasn't paying attention and added a small can of tomato paste instead of 2TBS, but it turned out wonderful.  I also added a can of black beans and red kidney beans.  The flavor was wonderful and just the right amount of heat..Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks

This was EXCELLENT!  My husband, who is NOT a fan of ground turkey...really enjoyed it.  Even after I told him it was turkey, he gave it a "thumbs up".  Will make again.

The recipe is good as is. If you really want to kick it up a couple of notches I recommend adding chili seasoned tomatoes  instead of plain, a couple dashes of worcestershire, a couple cans of beans,  some corn and half a bottle of good beer.

We loved this chili!  I browned the turkey, onions and peppers together (skipped the oil, oregano and pepper flakes) then poured it into a crockpot for 8 hours.  I also added a can of black beans.  Lastly, I added zucchini and frozen corn for the last 20 minutes.  Top with salsa, cheese, sour cream and FRESH cilantro.  To die for!  Thanks for sharing!

Very Nice recipe!  I made some modifications to it and it turned out wonderful.  A can of beef broth here (Canada) is 10 oz not 14 and I used a whole large can (28 oz) of diced tomatoes in place of 14 oz can of crushed.  Tomatoes are the base of the chili in my opinion and to forgo a large quantity and big chucky ones I think would be a mistake.  I added all the vegetables that were called for but in addition I also added 2 chopped carrots, 3 stalks of chopped celery, and an 8oz packaged of sliced mushrooms.  I too like thick chili and although I LOVE beans (especially kidney) I am trying a carb reduced diet (P90X!) and beans unfortnately are high on the list despite their other healthy and nutritious qualities!  By adding the other vegetables, the chili thickened up just how I like it and tasted great!!  I also did not have any green chili pepper so substitued with chili powder (1/4 cup).  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic, 1 teaspoon of basil, about 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of sugar to get rid of that bland taste that tomato paste usually has!  I also added half a can of light beer (i.e. Coors Light or Bud Light etc), yes beer!, as it gives chili that extra oomph!  I topped with fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheddar cheese.  YUM!  I would like to try this with the green chili beans next time but I think I will keep everything else the same.  Thank you SO much for sharing this delicious, healthy, recipe!

This really is pretty terrific.  Subbed chicken stock for beef broth and added a can of black beans.  No other changes.  Very flavorful!

Made it exactly as written with one added can of drained black beans...and wouldn't change a thing.  Really didn't miss the beef at all and THAT is exciting! Very hearty and satisfying. A keeper for sure.

Yum!  I love this & it freezes so well!  You can really chop up the veggies small so it all blends together for the chili.

I must admit, I took some liberties with this recipe, but it turned out very well!  The main thing I did was use ground beef, rather than turkey.  We prefer beef and the rest of the recipe looked so good, I took a chance with it.  I also upped the tomato paste and lessened the beef broth, because the chili was so runny, and still had to strain out some liquid to have a chili rather than a soup.  I did not cook the beef in vegetable oil either and left out the zucchini completely.  When it was all done I let it simmer on low for 30 minutes and the flavors came together wonderfully!  I served it with cheddar garlic biscuits and we had a great meal!  Will definitely make again!

This was one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted!! It was simple to make and didnt need any additional seasoning.  I added two cans of black beans and a large can of garbanzo beans. I also mixed in a couple of handfulls of reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese...YUM!!

Considering that I'm not usually a huge fan of chili, this was TO DIE FOR!!! All I've eaten for the last two days is this chili, I can't get enough of it. I also made a few changes. I added some chili powder (about 1/2 tablespoon), some portobello mushrooms (I happened to have some that were going bad and decided to throw them in) and about a tablespoon of chopped garlic. I also added a can of kidney beans with their liquid, and a whole can of tomato paste instead of just a tablespoon. I didn't have chile peppers so I added one jalapeno. All together, it's absolutely amazing. I don't doubt it's just as amazing without my adjustments, I just had a few extras laying around I needed to use up, so I threw them in. Will definitely make again! Thanks!

Weight Watchers people~ about 6 points per bowl (a good helping) if you use x-tra lean ground turkey. This doesn't include the sour cream and cheese on top. I even added a can of black beans, and a can of chili beans. To make servings bigger, add more 0 point veggies like mushrooms and bell pepper. I've lost 60 pounds on Weight Watchers, and I am extremely careful about calculating points, so you can trust me! ;)

Great chili. I made it exactly as directed, and it was the bomb! I doubled the recipe and put red beans in half of it (for my husband and daughter). We all fell in love with it. Delicious. I will make this again for sure.  (Made with "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread", which was perfect).

Great recipe. I've made this a few times. WARNING: Be careful about the salsa you use, I tried a few and generally speaking, mild is best vs. medium or hot. Hot and medium salsa were too hot. Great with chopped/minced cooked bacon and drippings added. Enjoy!

This is a fantastic turkey chili recipe. Easy to put together and everyone loved it. I used cut up yellow, crook-neck squash instead of zucchini, because that was what I had on hand. Also used fresh cilantro instead of coriander... tasted great! Served this with cornbread on the side. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This is a winner. Too spicy for me but I'm a whimp. My husband, who is picky, loved this recipe. It's a winner with me because it's quick and easy to make and gets rave reviews.

Delicious. Absolutely delicious. Next time I would maybe do a bit less meat and chili flakes. I also used chicken broth instead of beef. Other than that, this is a fantastic recipe.

This is my absolute favorite chili recipe EVER!  I made a few changes (as I do to every recipe).  I switched out the zucchini for corn and green pepper for yellow.  I also added black and kidney beans.  I have tried it with both turkey and beef.  Love it!

This wasn't very good. The texture of it killed it in my opinion, and it is hard to pass it off as chili without the beans. It was more of a thick soup/almost spaghetti sauce conistency. Not good. I made it and had 3 big tupperware bowls left overm that no one would eat :(

Thought it was delish.  Made a few changes based on what I had on hand...  I started by sauteeing diced onions, carrots, celery and peppers with olive oil and garlic.  Added and browned the turkey.  Added the seasonings and liquids as listed.  Left out the crushed tomatoes and zucchini.  Added black beans.  Served with crushed tortilla chips instead of the sour cream and green onions.  Will definitely be making this again!

Excellent chili recipe.  I 5x the recipe to make it for 30 people.  I found I needed to add a lot more heat for our taste.  Also added a can of black beans (x5), a can of garbanzo beans (x5), and a cup or so (x5) of freshly shucked corn that I blanched.  Many of my guests said it was the best child they have ever had.  I served it on top of their choice of Fritos or white rice, with sour cream, grated cheese, and chopped green onions for toppings.  I will definitely make this again!  Easy for a big party.

My husband and I loved it!!!  This is a keeper!  Unlike some reviewers, I don't like beans so I was very happy to find a recipe without any while still being hearty.  For the most part, I made the recipe as is, however, I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil, I didn't have coriander so I used a T of pasta seasoning, I used  low sodium beef broth, I found 2 zucchini was plenty (and I cut them up a bit smaller then the recipe called for), no bell pepper (because I don't like them), and I add a can of unsalted corn instead.  It is so yummy!!!  You must try it!

Very good!  It was nice and hearty and I actually felt like I was eating really healthy.  I used a can of red kidney beans (suggested by others) and only two zucchini b/c that was all I had- I thought it was plenty.  I didn't have sour cream, cheese or green onions and it was still great (though I will try with them next time)!  Thanks!

Very good chili that my whole family loved! I used ground turkey breast, (vs. ground turkey). What a great way to sneak some veggies into a dinner for a family picky eaters! I loved this so much that I sent it to my Mom so she could try it. Reheats well and is even better the second day!

Great chili.  I used leftover turkey, a 1.5 pound mix of dark and white meat, various chopped sizes.  I also added a can of black and white beans, rinsed and drained.

My family loved this. I added tomatoes and about a cup of water. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also used mild green chilis. This will probably be the only chili I make from now on.

Good base recipe. I did add black beans and corn to give it a little more body. I served it with spinach brownies from this site. Plenty of spice.

Very good!  I omitted the coriander and the chili pepper flakes.  I also used water instead of broth, fresh tomatoes from our garden instead of salsa and the crushed tomatoes.

This is such a fresh take on the tradtional chili! I love it because it has no beans. You don't even miss the beans w/ all the great veggies going on in this chili. I added a handful of frozen corn at the end :) It was delicious served w/ corn chips, shredded cheddar & sour cream! The last time I made this I added in a little browned chorizo along w/ the turkey & just omitted the oil. Doing this adds tons of extra flavor!

My husband loves chili and we are always looking for good ground turkey recipes so we're happy to have found this one.  I made some changes based on other reviews and what we had on hand.  Instead of 3 zucchinis I used one, a can of corn (drained) and a can of chili beans (not drained).  Instead of chopped tomatoes in puree and a can of green chiles, I used a can of tomatoes and chiles together.  We didn't have coriander or pepper flakes so I skipped those, and it was plenty spicy.  To reduce the amount of dirty dishes I sauteed the veggies together first, then cooked the meat (with salt and pepper and garlic) and added the veggies.  Served with grated cheddar and cornbread, and my husband and I both agreed it was better the next day!  Thanks!

Seriously fabulous chili!!  I even shared it via Facebook!!  LOVED the veggies -- didn't miss the beef one single iota!!  Used ground extra lean turkey breast, didn't use even close to as much oil as was suggested and added rinsed kidney beans.  Would be good with an avocado garnish, but I didn't have any.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!  This will be my "go to" chili from now on!!

EXCELLENT!! I read the reviews and added 2 things: beans and corn. That's it! We doubled the recipe for a party, but only used 2 zucchini since they were fairly large, and I think it was plenty. Chili just isn't chili without beans, and I LOVE corn, making this my absolute favorite chili ever. Its got a good bit of spice and tons of flavor. Sour cream and cheese on top, you can't beat it on a cold fall/winter day!

I am a little bit of a wimp when it comes to spice but I toughed it out for this recipe! :) With a glass of milk by my side, I enjoyed every bite! My husband and I chose to add a can of black beans. We did not use bell peppers, green onions, chile peppers, or zucchini because we did not have these items at home. It turned out great without all of the ingredients. However, we want to try it with the additional veggies next time! Enjoy!

This was a great meal!  The strips of zucchini really add to the texture and flavor.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, and added garbanzo beans.

I have made this recipe AGAIN and it just stays a good chili to make and I love that it adds zucchini because to me that adds something to it or it would be ordinary but... I got the directions right in front of me and it's somewhat confusing,I reread it several times and had my mother read it and nowhere does it say to add the zucc so I just did at the end. I sauteed them in butter then put them in the chili,I don't know why the recipe didn't say to but I did,I still love the chili but I just wanted to say how confusing it was. Thanks for the recipe Big Surprise,whoever you are.

This turned out to be one of the best pots of chili I ever made.  It is very flavorful with the ground turkey and seasonings cooked together.  I added a can of corn and black beans, and skipped the sour cream.

I love chili.  Usually with beef and beans.  But this is the all-time favorite chili of my wife and I.  I substituted chicken broth for beef broth.  The green onions, cheddar and sour cream on top make it perfect.  This chili is also excellent with all ingredients just thrown into a slow cooker.

Made this last night and it was tasty!!  I did use some of the other reviewer suggestions, like adding a can each of Black, Kidney & Cannelli Beans.  I also used a black bean & corn salsa, which worked out well.  I am going to make another batch, adding chilli powder & garlic.  I would have given the recipe a FIVE star rating if I hadn't needed to add the other ingredients.

This recipe is super delicious just the way it is. I've also had it with added black or kidney beans which is also good. I wouldn't have thought to put salsa or taco seasoning into chili, but it works so well! Its in my regular dinner rotation and we fight over the left overs!

My husband and I can't stand the texture of beans, and so I have never made chili . . . until now. Made this tonight and it is GREAT! Followed recipe exactly except trading the zucchini out for a little corn. I have what they call a "cat tongue" & don't even like the slightest heat, & this does have a little kick, but I could not stop eating this chili - just had to keep up with the water & fritos!  I did find after some searching that chili pepper flakes are the same as red pepper flakes; news to me!

Great recipe!!.  In place of the chili pepper flakes, I used 1/2 t. of cayenne pepper.  I added a can of mild chili beans and a can of cannellini beans.  I also used chicken broth instead of beef and 1 additional can of broth to improve the consistency.

GREAT! I used chicken stock instead and 1 crushed garlic clove and left out the zucchini as I didnt have any in the fridge, it was a very tasty and healthier than our usual ground beef chilli. Possibly 'to date' our favorite recipe from this site

Fantastic recipe! I added some yellow squash and fresh corn (both from my farmshare) and left out the coriander. I also used chicken instead of beef broth. It came out amazing, and is a great way to use up those veggies! I'm not crazy about squask or zucchini but ate every bite of it thanks to this recipe.

This was yummy.  I left out the tomato paste and did not cook the veggies separately.  Just put it all together after cooking the meat and let it simmer.  I reduced the turkey to 1/2lb and added a can of kidney beans.

Excellent!! I added a large can of chili beans. I used the recipe for taco seasoning mix on this website and I should have known it would come out too spicy because that mix already has chili flakes in it. I liked it but it was a little much for my son.

Great  recipe!  I used ground beef since that is what I had on hand.  I also added about 3/4 lb. diced mushrooms and instead of the can of green chile, I served it with jalapenos so everyone could make it spicy to their liking...my hubby likes alot and my son...not so much!  Thanks.

Great flavor, but a bit watery, in my opinion, to call it a chili.  I think a more appropriately descriptive name would be Tex-Mex Turkey Vegetable Soup.  Still a delicious recipe, though!

Excellent.  I don't usually like turkey chili but this was delicious.  Of course, like others, I kicked it up a notch by adding a small can of diced jalapenos, a teaspoon of garlic powder, 2 teaspoons of chopped garlic when cooking the onions and bell peppers and I did add 4 tbl of tomato paste along with 2 tbl of brown sugar & 1 can each of kidney and pinto beans to add to the fiber.  The blend of spices and beef broth really make this versatile and savory!

Great (and flexible!) recipe. My kids are particular about vegetables, so I used grated carrot, red pepper, one can of corn and one can of kidney beans instead of the onion, green pepper and zucchini. Really enjoyed the cilantro flavor. I will make this again!

Delicious.  I used extra lean ground turkey and you couldn't even tell that it wasn't ground beef.  Somuch healthier.  I also added a can of black beans, dark red kidney beans and a can of corn.  I did omit the zucchini.  So good..my 8 and 10 year old loved it!!

Very good but needed little bit of salt in my opinion.  I also added can of kidney and pinto beans (rinsed of course), and five cloves of garlic, and dash of chili powder.  I browned my meat and threw everything in the slow cooker for 5 hours.  Thank you for the recipe.

I've been trying to find a perfect chili recipe forever, and this is the closest I have come so far.  Of course, I changed a few things.  Like many other reviewers, I added 1 can of black beans and 1 can of garbanzo beans.  I also substituted the beef broth with one 12oz bottle of beer.  The beer I used was actually brewed with coriander, so I omitted that spice from the recipe.  I put out sour cream, cheese, and Fritos for toppings.  It tasted amazing!

Add 1/2 to whole can paste. 1/2 can chile peppers or none. Used red pepper flakes instead of chili pepper flakes. Added 1 can kidney beans.    Suggestions: Add 1/4-1/2 cup brown sugar. Can corn. Chicken broth. Garlic. After browning meat put in crock pot for 4 hrs high. Chick peas. Black beans. Carrots, celery. Cinammon.

This was a quick delicious chili with an alternative to beef, not that I don't like beef, I like beef alot. I was kindof wary about the amount of zuccini when I was preparing it, but when it came to the taste challenge the dish prevailed and left me full(but not too full) and satisfied. I added a can of black beans as recommended by one of the other reviewers and also a dash of cumin. I have never made chili without cumin and I don't plan on starting... ever.

I love this recipe. I can't count how many times I've made it. For the most part I follow the recipe exactly. However I don't use the zucchini and I add black and kidney beans to the recipe. This recipe is delicious and to die for!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe (4.5 stars) - it was quick and easy and a leaner alternative to ground beef.  I did add kidney beans and black beans because I enjoy the texture of beans in chili.  Thanks for the recipe - its a keeper.

I made this for tonight for me and my  11 year-old daughter.  We both loved it!  The only changes I made was to add a can each of kidney and black beans, and to substitute chicken broth for beef broth (I don't eat beef).  It was fun to make, smelled great, and tasted wonderful.  I really like the zucchini.  Oh, I left out the coriander because I don't have any and I was feeling cheap at the grocery and couldn't bring myself to spend $5 for a bottle of it -- I didn't miss it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good, but way too hot for our taste.  Will make again but half the peppers and reduce the pepper flakes.  Will also add corn and black beans next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice!  I had to fool with it (of course) to accommodate ingredients on hand but the end result was tasty.  Makes a bigger batch than 6 servings... we got at least 10 servings from one recipe.  Not a problem with hungry teens!

Used red pepper flakes in place of chili pepper flakes b/c I read they are the same thing.  I left out the veg oil to cut calories- didn't seem to need it anyway..I didn't have a can of beef broth so I used 2 beef boullion cubes with 2 cups of water and let the liquid simmer out about 10 minutes.  I added everything to the crockpot after the beef broth simmered with the meat.  I used 20 oz. diced tomatoes with green chilis as that is what I had on hand.  I also added 1 can kidney beans, rinsed and drained.  Added the zucchini an hour before I served it.  Excellent.  Will be a regular in our house.

I have tried many chili recipes and this by far is my favorite! My whole family raved about it and my husband usually snubs his nose at turkey chili...not this one though. I followed the advice of previous reviews and added 2 cans of beans...1 garbanzo and 1 black. I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 2Tbsp chopped garlic. I left out the green pepper for my picky eaters. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious. This will be my go to chili recipe from now on.

This was my first time making chili and it was great!  
.  I used 2lbs turkey.  Browned it then threw it all in a crockpot on low for 6 hours. I changed some of the ingredients just because of what I had on hand.  I added chili powder instead of flakes.  I also added a bag of frozen 3 peppers and onions blend.  I did not add the Chili peppers (we dont like it hot) and the zucchini (I couldnt find it this time of year).  I will definately add it when its in season next time.

I was initially skeptical about a chili recipe that used taco seasoning and salsa, but we made this in the crockpot yesterday and it was amazing!  Due to "special needs" stomachs in my house, we doubled the meat, halved the salsa and the chili, added a can of chili beans and a dash of cumin.  The resulting chili was flavorful and warm without being spicy hot but the beauty of this recipe is that you can tweak the heat without ruining it.  Thanks for sharing!!

not sure how you make a chili without adding garlic.  This chili was fantastic, just add some garlic with the onions.   Also, found it a little sweet, so I will account for that the next time i make it, which will be soon as it was awesome.  Having the zuccini in it was great!

Delicious!  I have tried a few other chili recipes on this site that also have high ratings, but they do not compare to this one.  This is my new go-to chili recipe.

Excellent!  I added two cans of black beans and one can of kidney beans. I didn't have taco seasoning so I just added a generous helping of chili powder and cumin. I omitted the tomato paste and the crushed tomatoes and added one 28 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes and 1 can of rotel tomatoes.  I also added a red pepper to pack in a few more veggies.  I will make this again!

We used shredded turkey leftovers, and my husband really enjoyed it. I only used about 1/2 the salsa specified and it was still plenty spicy. I added a can of black beans as well. I would make this again, but cut down on the salsa and crushed red pepper some more so my daughter could eat it next time.

I loved this recipe!  It was fun, healthy, and tasty.  My husband hates beans, so it was a great compromise.  I served it to him over a baked potato, and he loved it.  It would also go well over spaghetti.

Wow, okay hands down, this is a GREAT chili recipe. Its a peice of cake to make. I also love that you dial it down or up depending on how hot you like it. I purchased spicy salsa and spicy taco season and as a result, this chili packed a punch. I added 3 cans of various beans to make it thick. This is a recipe I plan to make again and again.

This was great! I did add the garbanzo and also a can of black beans. For me, its really not chili unless it has beans in it! This is VERY good and healthy. Fantastic with a loaf of crusty bread, a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar cheese. I've made it a couple different times a couple different ways, and its been great every time. Freezes and reheats beautifully.

Love it!  So similar to the turkey chili I make, but I love that you added zucchini!  Yeah!  Gotta have some kind of beans in mine, but thanks for the tip. Great dish (and the cheese is a must).

We loved this version of turkey chili, and I made it exactly as the recipe said.  Next time I may add some black beans to it as well.  My fiance went back for seconds and thirds, and my 10-year-old wolfed it down!  Yummy!

This was my first attempt at making chili and it came out great. And it was super easy to make, just throw everything in a big pot. The best part is there is a lot of room to make the recipe your own, I added a packet of chili seasoning, a can of black beans, kidney beans and corn. I think the turkey meat was very good, you will never miss the more fatty ground beef.

I have made this several times over the past few months, and every time, my VERY picky husband (who, until he tasted "my" chili, never liked anything but his recipe) RAVES about it. I also add 14.5 oz cans of corn, kidney beans, and black beans, and use a half teaspoon of chili habanero sauce to give it more kick. I expect to make this for a long time!

This is the best chili I've made/made.  My husband (who doesn't like turkey anything) didn't even know it was not ground beef.  I added 2 cans of beans, because we love them no other changes except to add some garlic.  I threw the onion right in with the turket to cook first with olive oil, then the spices.  My 7 year old had 2 helpings, and it tasted even better the next day.  Perfect with homemade cornbread.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I had to take the time to write a review for this recipe! I trippled this and served it at a party i had and EVERYONE loved it! People could not stop talking about how good it was and asked me to bring leftovers the next night to another get together! I made exactly the same recipe with adding chille powder to the meat alond with taco seasoning and I added a minced jaleapeano with the onion and bell pepper. I made mine in after noon and than moved in to crock pot and put on high for four hours. I think this really helped get the flavors going and cook the zuchinni! I have a feeling this recipe will be made a lot of times on request!

Great recipe!  Very tastey and easy to make.  The prep time was nothing and the time to cook (considering it is chili) was relatively short.  For a turkey chili, this one is hard to beat.  Looking forward to leftovers for lunch today!

The only thing I added was a can of drained sweet corn. The heat was just right and even my beef loving boyfriend was raving about it. I will definately be making this again very soon!

The best flavored chili I've ever eaten.  Cooked for about 8 friends and all were surprised to see zuccini!  I added a can of corn, one of chick peas and one of black beans, some garlic and a dash of chili powder.  Did not have bell pepper and didn't miss it.  I also cut up half of a hillshire farms smoked sausage and threw that in.  Cooked all but the zuccini for about 2 hours then put in the zuccini and cooked another 30 minutes.  Really much better than traditional chili and much healthier too.

Maybe it is because i am used to tex-mex style chilis, but this was a bit bland for me.  It lacked the umph that I look prefer in chilies...maybe some type of bean would have helped.  I ended up adding salt, garlic powder and just a bit of cinnamon and liked it alright that way.

Found this recipe when my husband requested turkey chili. Simple, easy, and nothing exotic. Made a couple changes: used 2 smallish zucchini as that was all I could find, but could have definately done with 3. Added a can of mixed beans, but I'll probably add another can of kidney beans. Instead of browning the onion, pepper and zucchini, I just tossed it into the chili as I was planning on letting it simmer. Didn't add the jar of chili's, but as I used a medium salsa, it was quite spicy enough. Will definately forward this recipe to my brother as he loves chili, but his wife doesn't eat beef.

I tweaked this recipe a bit by adding ground chicken instead of the turkey. I also used chicken stock instead of beef stock. Added about half a bottle of Sam Adams Honey Porter beer (have also used the Winter lager in the past) to give it a deeper body. Added chili power (to taste), a can of drained kidney beans and a couple of dashes of Texas Pete. Delicious, easy and better the second day you eat it.

Delish!  I am a fan of chili and this one didn't disappoint.  As a note I didn't have all the ingredients on hand... Corriander for one and my kids don't like spicey so I left out the pepper flakes or green chile peppers and green bell pepper. (I know... I'm changing the recipe a lot)  The great thing about chili is it is VERY forgiving and even when it's not the best it's still really good!  My family hated the zucchini though (I liked it!).  Along with the above changes, I didn't have ground turkey, I used some hamburger and some chicken breast sliced thinly and seasoned like the ground turkey would be.  I actually really like the chicken in it like this!  It gives it nice big chunks that are full of flavor.  I also added a can of kidney beans and a can of black beans - both drained!  Everything was good and very simple.  Threw it all together in about 30 minutes.  Taco seasoning mix worked surprisingly well.

This is a great recipe for Turkey Chili. The changes I made were to add a can of black beans and a can of corn. Instead of chili flakes I used mild chili powder. I omitted the zucchini, as I really do not care for zucchini.  I think next time I would add the whole can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce a bit more because the actual sauce was a little runny for my liking.

I added garbanzo beans and black beans and cooked a little longer to boil off some of the water. I cooked it for about 2 hours total. My only minor gripe is that the use of the taco seasoning (obviously) lends this chili more of a taco flavor than of the typical Cumin flavor of most chili. Don't get me wrong, the taste is still great and the amount of spice is perfect for me. If you want to judge the flavor based on that of a more typical chili though, you might want to make some spice substitutions. Overall though, it was still a great meal and leftovers were great too.

Everyone loved this except the 8yo...will save and hopefully his tastes will change! Added 1 can (amount) of frozen corn, drained black beans, drained red kidney beans, and sliced zucchini into 6ths so the pieces were more the size of the beans. Hubby had seconds....this was great for a cold, foggy day! Update: took to a teachers' luncheon and I made labels with the name of the recipe and the website link. All 30 labels were taken! Everyone loved this! I made a pot of spicy for the teachers, with a heaping tbsp of red pepper flakes. GREAT on a cool day!

I got rave reviews of "the best chili we have ever had" from friends and family.  I used veg broth because I didn't have beef, one can of corn, and one can of beans.  Instead of using green peppers, I used a can of tomatoes with green peppers (or chile's I forget).  Crockpot on high for 5 hours.  Wonderful.  Thanks.

Great tasting turkey chili!  Like many, I made a couple of changes based on what was on hand:  no zucchini (but will surely add next time for another dimension), used chipotle flakes instead of red pepper flakes for some added smokiness, and added a can of chili beans. Really turned out well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and I absolutely adore this recipe!  I made a few adjustments to cater to my husband's taste.  I only use 1/2 can of green chile peppers, and add 1/2 can jalapeno peppers.  That really spices it up!  I've also left out the coriander because I don't have any, and I increased the cooking time to a few hours.  It is a winter favorite in our house.  I make a big batch and freeze part of it.  It's delicious with corn chips!

I really love this chili.  I leave out the peppers (taste preference) and it still has plenty of flavor.  I also add chick peas or cannelini beans.  It's a little time intensive but I just double the recipe - it freezes great.  Try it with 'Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole' for a perfect comfort food dinner.

I had never made chili before so I was really nervous how it would turn out, but holy cow this is the best chili I've ever had in my life! I added a tad more chili powder to give it a little more of a kick, and I didn't have any ground turkey so I used 93% lean ground beef. Will DEF be making this on a regular basis!

Very good and healthy. I didn't have a green pepper, so I omitted that and all I had was burrito seasoning mix. But it was still REALLY GOOD. I did add garbonzo beans as well. It makes a ton, it will be good to freeze.

I really liked this recipe!  I always tweak recipes as I go though.  I was going to make my own salsa but, didn't have time but, added a southwest salsa that turned out perfect.  I think you can use taco seasoning or chili seasoning-I used chili-I served it will tostada chips and sprinkled shredded cheese over it too.  I also added chili beans 1/2 can and 1/2 of cantenelli beans.  My family loved it and I will make it again.  I really like the zuchinni added to it-great way to add more veggies to your meals.

Absolutely love this!  Once again, I used my slow cooker after browning the turkey.  I love the addition of the zucchini, and I also chose to add some leftover corn and great northern beans.  This is a spicy, hearty, and healthy chili that we all enjoyed for dinner.  Thanks!

Very good!  We added garbanzo and black beans (3 cans total) and only half a pound of turkey.  Didn't have tomato paste and we think that may have made it watery.  Tried to remedy it w/ adding instant mashed potato flakes.  Worked, but left stringing stuff in the chili, which was kind of gross.

Great and easy! I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey rather than ground, and vegetable stock rather than beef. The taco seasoning mix, green chile peppers, and salsa make this simple dish into something special.

I like that this has veggies, served it over rice for a complete meal!  Doesn't have much kick, but I can add that next time.  Solid recipe, it'll be fun to play with it.

This is a fabulous chili and one that I'm planning on making over and over again! The zucchini really makes this recipe!  I also added more beans, black, kidney and pinto, and I also added a can of corn. You could really add anything to it to your liking.   My family never knew this was a turkey chili until I told them, they never would have guessed!

I thought this was alright, it seemed to be missing something. This is a little on the hot side. I was making this for the kids, they don't like hot but I do. I would omit the pepper flakes for them next time. I used only 2 zucchini as 3 is too much. added 1 can corn as suggested from other reviews, and some minced garlic. it turned out good. I think next time I would add some carrots. I would add beans but my kids don't care for beans and that's why I chose this recipe to begin with. just gotta play with it a little more for the kids' sake.

Delicious! As others have mentioned adding kidney or black beans is great (I substituted 1 can of drained black beans for some of the zuchini), and some corn is good too (added 1/2 bag frozen kernel corn).   We used the leftovers to make chili avocado frittatas and chili eggs benedit (spicy sour cream instead of hollondaise [sp?]).

Previous to trying this recipe, I have been using the same chili recipe for years. It will now be replaced with Terrific Turkey Chili! This recipe is absolutely wonderful - you would never know it was made with turkey! The flavor, texture & heat level are perfect, I did not change a thing!

LOVED this Chili!!! Added some paprika and cayenne pepper, a dash of sugar, black beans and Cannellini beans. My husband loves it spicy so I just added some hot sauce to his bowl. Our girls can’t handle the heat… Everyone LOVED it. Will make this one often.

Everyone loved it. Even my friend who's going to culinary school. This makes a good amount of zucchini. Two medium one are good enough if you don't want a lot of it.

Used a combination of spices to replace the commericial taco mix and added a can of beans but otherwise followed the recipe as stated.  It was delicious.  My beef eating husband gobbled it up for lunch all week and my nephew couldn't get enough.

We like "high-heat" chili and this was definitely spicy. If you are not into hot chili, watch out with the spices.  Excellent chili.

OMG, this was the most yummy chili I have ever made! I used 2 lbs turkey, 2 large onions, 6 really small peppers, the whole small can of tomato paste, none of the chili pepper flakes or chiles (I can't eat spicy foods), a big can of crushed tomatoes, 4 cans of different beans and garlic. Everything else was the same. I cooked the onions, turkey, peppers, zucchini and garlic in a big pot until the turkey was brown, drained, then tossed it all in the crockpot for 4 hours on high. It was soooo good! Will be eating this for days. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I loved this recipe!  It was so simple to make.  I cooked the turkey, sauteed the onions with some garlic and then stuck everything an a crockpot.  I only used 1 zuchinni (its all I had)...I added some additional seasonings, but I am sure it would have been fine the original way. I also added the kidney beans, garbonza beans and black beans.  The salsa I used had lots of corn in it.  It really was simple to make, but the taste was like I spent hrs on it :-)  Thanks!

Very good!!  This was my first attempt at homemade bean-less chili.  I couldn't find a 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes, so I subbed a 14.5 can of diced (drained) and an 8 oz can tomato sauce.  I was afraid 3 zucchinis might be too much so I just used 1 but threw in an extra pepper.  My pepper flakes are in a grinder - it turned out quite spicy with a whole teaspoon of ground up pepper flakes - but I liked it.  I am SO glad I didn't add chili powder before tasting it!!!  It would have been way too hot for me.  I thought the consistency was just right.  I never added water at any time during the cooking.

This was my first chili making attempt and it was a crowd pleaser! I did add 1 jalapeno pepper (only used half the seeds) because we like it a little more spicy.  Also substituted chili seasoning for taco seasoning. Turned out great with good consistency. I will definitely make this again!

This was so delicious!  I wasn't sure about the zucchini, so I only used half (it was really yummy though!).  I also substituted red pepper flakes because I did not have chili flakes.  I will definitely make this again and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a delicious, tasty chili recipe.

I'm new to the cooking life and my husband and I usually try to eat healthy. I thought this would be a great healthy dish. I did everything that the recipe calls for but I also added 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 cans of red kidney beans. My husband was very happy with the results as were everyone else in my family. And because of the demand, I have given this recipe out, several times. Thank you!!

Love it! I added a can of each of corn, black beans and pinto beans.  Because of all those extras, I had to add some water to get the right consistancy. I like that it's full of vegetables and bold flavors. This one's a keeper.

Excellent! I made this with left over turkey from the Thanksgiving meal, I omitted the paste and salsa and used canned diced tomatoes and added a can of black beans. The depth of flavor was wonderful!

I was hungry for chili but wanted something different than my usual recipe.  I'm a big fan of ground turkey so when I saw this one it was a must-try.  The title is well-earned "Terrific" because it is just that.  I only used one pound of turkey and it was plenty (I like lots of meat so another 1/2 pound would have been too much) The addition of taco seasoning is by far one of the best ingredients in my opinion.  I used a homemade taco seasoning from this site that is amazing and I will never use another.  I had to add kidney beans like other reviewers because I love my chili with beans.  I did the directions differently and didn't use the oil at all.  I find that with ground turkey, if you cook it on a low medium setting it doesn't cook too fast and doesn't stick.  So I browned the turkey along with onions, two large cloves garlic, green peppers and added the seasonings.  When that was cooked I added the beef broth, crushed tomatoes and kidney beans.  I didn't have zucchini and didn't bother with the sour cream and cheese.  It was good enough without the garnish (and extra calories) This was exactly the recipe I was looking for - full of flavor and a comfort food all rolled into one.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow this is good!  I did add a can of black and pinto beans each as others suggested.  I'm not a great cook but this was easy and my husband ate seconds!

This has become a staple in our house. Best chili ever. Careful...it's pretty spicy as written. You can always cut back on the chilies or the red pepper if you like a milder version.

We LOVED this recipe!  Even those in our family who aren't crazy about ground turkey raved about this chili.

This is my favorite chili recipe! I found it here a couple of years ago and have been making it since.  We prefer our chili without beans, so this was perfect. I've made it both with turkey and with beef. Both ways were delicious.

Delicious! Made this in the crockpot. Browned the meat and onions san spices. Then threw everything in the crockpot. Didn't have coriander, so I skipped that. Used chili powder instead of flakes. Omitted the tomato paste. Used 1/2 -1 cup of Pace Picante Sauce Medium (thought I bought salsa for a party and bought Picante sauce by mistake, but the sauce is perfect for this chili). Added two cans of beans based on another review. Cooked everything (minus zucchini and peppers) for 6 hours on low. Added zucchini and peppers at end for 1.5 hrs on low. YUM YUM YUM!! Thank you for an awesome recipe. Made a lot to save for later too!

This was really good.  I added a bit of ketchup to offset the spice, and added a can of diced tomatoes, kidney beans, and tomato sauce and a 2nd gr pepper.  I am doing weight watchers, so I cut down the ground turkey to 1 lb, and also used just 1 Tbl of oil and a good non-stick pan.  It was a great hearty chili!

I followed the recipe to the tee and I always added some changes. I only used 4 oz. of the green chiles; 7 oz. was a little TOO spicy but that also only matters on taste. I did follow everyones suggestion on adding beans and almost any work. I've tried it with pinto, red, garbanzo, etc. As a side dish I made honey cornbread muffins. The sweetness of the muffins pairs great with the spicy chili. AMAZING recipe. Enjoy!!:)

This recipe earned thumbs up from an entire Christmas party. I do a lot of different kinds of hunting during the winter, and I needed a recipe to use for some wild Canada Goose. I've listed all the substitutions are variations I used. The majority of my guests, like myself, like spicy cajun food, so I went with that theme.  I chopped 3 goose breasts into small cubes to substitute for the turkey, and used a bag of Tex-Mex chili seasoning instead of taco mix. Instead of the crushed tomatoes, I used a can of Medium-Spice Rotel tomatoes, and also added a can of chili beans and 3 freshly chopped jalapenos. I reduced the zucchini from 3 down to 1, and added 1/2 of a yellow squash for color. Instead of the chili pepper flakes (who sells those??) I used red pepper flakes, and I added about a teaspoon and a half of 50/50 Cayenne and Chili powder mix.  I followed the rest of the recipe until completion, and then refridgerated the chili overnight. I woke up the next day and put the chili in the crock pot on "Warm" for about 8 hours to really let the peppers release their warmth. All our guests were dumbfounded to learn they'd eaten, and LOVED, wild game, especially wild game with a not so great plate-reputation.

Not terrible but could be better. I did as the recipe said but replaced the zucchini with beans. The part i didn't like is that I could taste the beef broth. I did add a few things like paparika, salt, pepper, extra tomato paste and a little water. It would be great if it didn't taste like the beef broth. Some people substituted it for chicken broth. I might try that next time if my husband likes it. Too spicy for my children.

This recipe was great.  I added 3 teaspoons of brown sugar, left out the coriander (didn't have any), left out the zucchini and used two fresh jalapeno peppers finely diced.  Left everything else the same and wow was it good.  It was a good combo of spicy and sweet.

great recipe! Used cooked turkey ground up since I had it on hand, and a whole can of tomato paste. Also had on hand homemade salsa, and fresh roasted chile peppers, so I used them also instead of the canned.  Added a can of pinto beans and can of kidney beans. Will make this one again!

Very simple. I had been looking for a chili recipe for awhile. I've never made it, and it was easier than I thought! I added the tomato paste and seasonings, and it colored the ground turkey, so I was worried if I browned it enough, but I figured it would cook while I stewed it with the rest of the ingredients.  I couldn't find zucchini, so I left that part out. I doubled the recipe because it was easier, I could only find a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes, a 14 ounce of salsa and I didn't want to waste a 6oz can of tomato paste, so I just used it all.  It tasted delicious! I can't believe I spent $2.50 a cup of chili at Quiznos when I can make it myself with unlimited "refills"! The flavor was very good. I added cayenne pepper to the onions and green pepper as I was sauteeing them, to give it more spice. I also added a can of black beans 30 minutes before turning off the heat.   If anyone could help me, how can you thicken the base? I tried adding cornstarch mixed with water, but I was afraid to add too much cornstarch, so it made the chili MORE runny because of the addition of more water. After stewing though, some water evaporated and it was okay. It wasn't the right consistency I was hoping for, but it was very delicious. My picky eater of a brother loves it! :] Thanks!

Excellent chili.  I've made this twice, and the whole family loves it and can't tell that it isn't beef.  I add kidney beans, and I also used the whole can of tomato paste since we like thick chili.

This is a fantastic chili recipe, and great for people like me who can't eat beef. The only changes I made: I left out the zucchini and added one can each of black and kidney beans near the end of cooking. I didn't add any extra water, and it came out with a great, thick consistency. I chose Herdez brand salsa, specifically the Ranchero flavor, and it was perfect with the other ingredients.

Wonderful!  I loved this recipe!  I made a few changes-- no coriander, because I didn't happen to have it, and I just used extra regular chili powder in place of chili flakes, which I couldn't find.  I didn't have zucchini, so I added 1 can each of chickpeas and black beans, and it came out sensational!  I will make this again and again!

Really good chili. I didn't have zucchini, so added slice carrots instead. Followed other reviewer's changes and used chicken broth, 28 oz can diced tomatoes and a whole can of tomato paste. Browned and sauted the ingredients as written and poured into crockpot and cooked on low 6 hours. I am looking forward to fixing it again and using the zucchini. I also will try just browning the turkey and adding the rest of the ingredients to the crockpot and cooking on low longer.

Great! Easy to make and deliscious! Not too salty, not to spicy (depending on salsa and if you add hot sauce), and not too heavy.

Really good, added a can of diced tomatoes along with the crushed, used only 1/2 a green pepper, and added a medium sized can of pinto beans, turned out great.

This was surprisingly good - I let it simmer for a couple of hours also why dirty another pot - I sauteed the vegetables in the dutch oven before I browned the meat then set aside until the meat was ready.

I made this chili for my bro's birthday party....many people said it was the best they've had.  You don't lose a thing with the ground turkey.  I transfer everything to a crockpot when it's done and let it sit on low for a few hours...unbelieveable!

Very good!  I browned the onion and ground chicken, then put them in with the rest of the ingredients in a crock pot on low.  I also added some mild chicken sausage (browned first) and was very pleased with the addition.  Best chili recipe I've tried so far!

Delicious!  I just browned the turkey and tossed it all in the crock pot for the day.  I did add a can of black beans for a little more substance.  My whole family loved it and I will definitely make it again!  Thank you!

I've never had chili OR made chili before!  This was great.  I did add a can of kidney beans to it (per the boyfriend's request - but I picked mine out b/c I don't like beans).  And I browned the turkey and then dumped everything in the crockpot for 4 1/2 hours.  SO EASY and very tasty! EXCELLENT!

Great recipe- I browned the ground turkey (only use 1 lb.) on the stove and then put that, and all the other ingredients, into the crockpot in the morning, and cooked it on low all day.  I did add a little extra water, and used the whole can of tomato paste.  Love how this uses zucchini- it was really good in there!  I love beans so I added a can of black and a can of pinto.  (Garbanzo's aren't my thing).  I used a red pepper instead of the green.  Everyone loved this- even my five and three year olds.  Served with sour cream and tortilla chips.

For me, this was not even a good base for chili.  More like a very watery and bland soup.

I almost never follow a recipe exactly as written.  I believe that recipes are a guideline and everyone adjusts it according to what they have on hand and to their personal tastes as well.  With that being said this recipe was a very good starting point and I am only posting my changes for my own reference later on.  

I used boneless chicken thighs and breast bc that was what I had in the freezer.  I would have loved to try the zucchini but had none.  I added a can of black beans, light kidney beans, and some leftover corn from the night before.  I diced an onion, a green pepper, several cloves of garlic and a stalk of celery and sautéed them in some vegetable oil.  Then I sautéed the chicken which I had cut into bite sized pieces.  Threw all of that in the crockpot and added the seasoning.  I made my own taco seasoning from this site bc I didn't have any of the packaged kind and left out the coriander (I don't even know what it is).
Next I added one can of diced tomatoes, one can of tomatoes with green chiles, the salsa, and a small jar of homemade v8 juice. Next came the beans and corn.  I did not use beef broth but added a couple of tsp of chicken bouillon base ( with no sodium, this recipe does not need any added salt bc there is plenty in the taco seasoning).  Cooked for 3-4 hrs on high then tasted it.  It was nearly perfect at this point but tasted very acidic to me from the tomatoes so I threw in a little brown sugar.  It is now the perfect pot of soup. 5+ stars.

I made this chili last night for a very large group.  I tripled the recipe, used chicken stock instead of beef stock and added one can of black beans and one can of red kidney beans.  It came out DELICIOUS and everyone was raving about it.  Such a nice hearty meal with just the right amount of kick.  We plan to make this meal the centerpiece of an annual holiday kickoff party.  Will definitely make this again!

Very tasty! I had ground turkey and decided to make chili for chili dogs. This was very good as is but we like our stuff spicy. So I added a diced up jalapeno pepper, a bit of cumin powder a tad more pepper flake. Toasted some hot dog buns, topped the dogs with this chili, jack/chedder cheese and red onions and O BOY! was it good. My husband's new favorite chili and he LOVES beef chili.

I dont cook, but I wanted to show off for my wife. This is Great chili!!! Took me a bit longer to make cuz i forgot to defrost the meat but besides that it was great. Only concern is the amount of sodium in the finished product; one serving has an entire days worth of salt...Ouch!!!

Yum yum! We used the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe on this site b/c we didn't have a packet, and it was GREAT! The only thing we changed was not adding the zucchini, and that was only because we actually ATE all that was in our garden. (Weird, I know.) This was absolutely delicious.

This is the first time I've made chilli. My husband hates beans, so it never occurred to me to find a recipes without beans. We are also trying to reduce his intake of red meat. This recipe was perfect! I made a few modifications - I left out the coriander, because I didn't have any, but I did add crushed garlic. I used homemade taco seasoning because I make it sodium-free (A salt-free version of Allrecipes Taco Seasoning I). I used "no salt added" fat free beef broth. I used sweet corn instead of zucchini. We added crushed tortilla chips on top. I accidentally bought hot salsa, and it really gave tons of heat to this recipe. My husband loved it, but next time, I think I'll go for medium, because my mouth was burning! The cheese and sour cream helped put the fire out Other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out great. I plan to freeze the leftovers in 1-2 portion servings and use it for quick lunches.

This is my all time favorite chili! I use red and yellow bell peppers instead of green and also use only two well chopped zuchini instead of three. I also double the red pepper flakes since I never seem to have corriander and round up all the tomato and salsa ingredients. Last time I accidentally used a whole can of tomato paste (one of the little ones) and it was a great "mistake". I have made this a few times now and always just love it. It never lasts long in my house!

I made this pretty much almost as written. I did not have coriander & left out green chiles by choice. This was a great and super easy recipe but too spicy for my young children. I also simmered it a good 30-45 minutes after all the ingredients were added. Maybe this was omitted? Cooking time is noted as 55 minutes but does not say this in the actual recipe other than 5 min here, 10 min there, etc. I will make it again and adjust the spices accordingly.

Really good chlii!  I added some pinto beans to the chili because I felt that it needed a little something more.  I also used shredded leftover turkey from Thanksgiving instead of ground turkey.  Everyone at our family get together LOVED it!

My husband and kids say this is the best chili they've ever eaten! They were amazed to find out it was made with ingredients they normally don't enjoy. I thinly sliced zucchini, yellow squash, onion & yellow bell pepper, which I added to the ground turkey, as it was cooking. I added just a bit of water to the mix, keeping the turkey from clumping. My kids are major bean fans, so I added a can of ranch style pinto beans w/jalapeno's, chili beans & black beans. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes with onions & garlic. I didn't have beef broth, so substituted chicken broth. I served over chips, topped with shredded cheddar cheese. I'm thrilled to have found a healthy version of chili. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks so much for sharing!

Excellent recipe, but I did change a few ingredients.  I used a shredded, cooked boneless turkey breast, 2 28oz cans of tomato sauce, 1 can tomato soup (instead of tomato paste, beef broth, salsa & crushed tomatoes) and put it all in the crockpot for 6-8 hours.  It was delicious.  A keeper at my house.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for Thanksgiving night supper and my family raved about it!!  I have to agree with other reviewers--even those who don't particularly care for ground turkey will love this.  My mother-in-law asked me to make this for a party she is having in a few weeks and my brother-in-law begged to take home the leftovers.  A definite keeper!!

Such a great recipe! As others have suggested, it's a great base recipe that can be tweaked to your own liking. I browned the turkey without the oil because I didn't feel it was necessary. I used some of the beef broth to mix with the taco seasoning to cook that in. From there, I just added the salsa and tomatoes and started simmering, throwing things in as I went. I used two 4oz cans of green chiles, half a jumbo white onion and an entire green pepper. I also threw in two stalks of chopped celery. I left out zucchini because I'm not a big fan, and added two cans of black beans because I love them. I think the best part was using two cans of fire roasted tomatoes instead of the other kind as suggested... it ended up with a nice, robust flavor! I also added a bottle of my favorite local beer, a malty sweet red that I thought would balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Beer may sound weird, but it comes out awesome! I used an entire 6oz can of tomato paste so I wouldn't waste it, and left out coriander because I didn't have any. Simmered for about 3-3.5 hours and the end result was to die for! I absolutely LOVED it and so did my friends and family! My mom said it was actually better than her own chili that I grew up on! A little cooking tip for the beginners like me... cooking with the lid off will remove more of the liquid and cook down into a thicker chili. If it is already thick enough, keep the lid on while it is simmering. Enjoy everyone, this is highly recommended!!

I won a chili contest with this recipe making a few adjustments. Omitted the oil and used Pam and browned the onions in with meat. Used 1/2 the chili pepper. Omitted salsa, green chilis and tomatoes and added three cans of mild rotel. Omitted green pepper and zucchini and added one can black beans and one can pinto beans drained. After browning the meat I took meat mixture and added rest of ingrediants and placed on low in crockpot for 8 hours. Was a big hit!

Oh Maw Gawd this chili is AWESOME.  I hate coriander so I used cumin, oregano and chili powder but this was so good, an entire crock pot lasted just one day.  Flavorful, hearty and just the right spice!  Family LOVED it!

Even my 4 1/2 and very picky 2 year old ate this chili and my husband and I loved it.  I took some ideas from others and browned the meat in a pan and then added all the ingredients into a crockpot on high for 4 hours and the veggies were not mushy at all!  I also added two large garlic gloves (minced) and a can of kidney beans and another of canelli beans.  I will definitely make this one again!

This chili is fantastic!  I had just used my last zucchini before I made this so, sadly, there wasn't any zucchini in it but I will make sure I have some on hand for the next time I make this.  My husband loved it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

The salsa, taco seasoning and zucchini caught my eye leading me to try this …and I was not disappointed. It was a delicious hearty chili! I used “Restaurant-Style Taco Meat Seasoning,” from this site. I added 1 can each of northern beans and kidney beans for color, texture and nutrition. I like my chili with beans and also thick not too soupy or runny. I also added a couple of garlic cloves, chopped. I omitted the can of green chile peppers, added a teeny pinch of chili pepper flakes. Rather than add just 2T of tomato paste and waste the remainder of the can I used the entire 6 oz. can along with chicken broth. Thou the cooking time was approximate, chose to I simmer the chili for a while. Right before serving, I topped this with a little sour cream, shredded cheese and green onions. The chili was seasoned just right, not spicy and with a good consistency. I’m glad I added the beans as it gave the chili a little more body. Tonight my family wanted this served over hot rice thou I would have preferred this with cornbread. Either way this was a nice blend of flavors and one I would consider making again. By the way I think this would also taste good over a plate of hot spaghetti noodles.

I loved the chili.  I substituted the turkey for beef, added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a pint of mango pico de gallo.  It made it a great sweet chili.

This really hit the spot!  I added corn and garbanzo beans during the last 15 minutes as others suggested.  Goes really well with the "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" recipe found on this site.

We will DEFINITELY make this again!

Tasty and healthy dish.  I like having a change from the traditional chili with beans.  Since I did not have either beef broth or crushed tomatoes on hand, I substituted vegetable juice and water.  The flavor was a little spicy for my kids, but my husband and I liked it fine as is.

This is really good chili. I didn't change any ingredients. The instructions are a little weird, and I'd do things in a different order next time. Really, two pans to make chili? But the spices were great and my entire family liked it.

My go to chili! I prefer a lighter chili with lots of veggies and this is perfect. I took others advice and browned the pepper and onion in the pan with the meat to cut down on time. I also use veggie stock and a little chicken bouillon. I add a dash of this and a dash of that to taste - but a great starter.

Added 1 can of black beans and 1/2 can of corn + juice from the corn at the suggestion of other reviewers. Simply the BEST chilli I've ever made. Rave reviews all around. A+ will make again soon.

Pretty darn good! Made with beef because that's what I had on hand love the addition of zucchini. Thanks! **edited- I made this again but made substitions based on what I had on hand. Vegetable broth in place of beef, homemade taco seasoning, tomatoes with jalapenos in place of the green chilies and added one can chili beans and one can kidney beans. Delicious!

This was the bomb!  I made exactly as written except added a few teaspoons of brown sugar to cut down on the acidity and added a can of black beans and a can of kidney beans as others suggested.  We are a family of picky eaters who don't like a veggie chunky chile or sauces, so I chopped all the veggies up fine in a chopper before I added to the chili and noone even new the veggies were in there!  Definitely a keeper, and so healthy!

I made quite a few modifications, but just to suit my taste.  I like things spicy, so I did the following: added chili powder, cumin, garlic powder and red pepper flakes to my taste.  I also subbed diced tomatoes, used red and yellow peppers (just threw into pot along with turkey and onions) and added a can each of black, kidney and garbanzo beans.  I also sauteed the zucchini for about 10 min. because I prefer them without a crunch in soups.  Does NOT take long to throw together...and you can't really mess this one up!  A good weeknight fix!

This was WONDERFUL! I changed a few things as well.  Adding Kidney beans and black beans gave it the chili feel. I also used chili powder instead of the flakes. If you like garlic, I suggest adding chopped garlic or garlic salt!  Very yummy!

Like most everyone, I modified this somewhat. I ixnayed the green chilis and chili pepper flakes. Subbed in its place a hot and spicy taco seasoning with chipotle and a tablespoon of Ancho chili powder.I added two cans of beans, one of black, one of kidney and added an additional of can of chopped tomatoes. The result is most decidedly delicious and I'll make this again. I should add, I also did not use the cheddar or sour cream. I've no doubt those would be awesome on this but why bother going to the expense of ground turkey if you're just going to deep 6 the health benefits? A good if somewhat odd base recipe but delightful nonetheless.

I've now made this 5-6 times and it is FABULOUS!!!  The first time I made this I was thinking 3 medium zucchini was a TON, but it cooks down quite a bit and is perfect. I like beans in my chili, so I added a can of black and a can of cannelini beans and it fleshed it out perfectly. This was amazing served with some tortilla chips and is in now our regular rotation. There was a suggestion to use a taco seasoning mix from this site by Bill Engols and I would repeat that.  It does wonders in an already fabulous chili!

Amazing chili!!! Loved it. Added a few extra things. One clove of crush garlic, 1 teaspoon of chili powered, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 2 cans of kidney beans, drained. Next time I will cut the red pepper flakes down to 1/2 teaspoon. It was a little hot for us. I served this with spinach salad and hard rolls. So YUMMY!!!!

I searched for a chili recipe with turkey meat to make for Super Bowl Sunday.  The reviews for this recipe were so impressive and so was the recipe!  I made 2 batches due to the size of our group and the only things I changed is I used garlic ground coriander, added a can of black beans and also added some more chili pepper flakes as we like it spicy down here:)  Didn't need to add any water as the beef broth had enough liquid. The flavor was incredible and everyone loved it.  This is definitely going down as an all time favorite recipe and I will make many times over!

Made this as written and it was rated "best taste" at an office chili competition.  Definitely better two days later when all the flavors soaked into the chili.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the zucchinni, though I like the pieces cut a little smaller.

This was the first time I've ever made Chili and it turned out great! Added a can of black beans and a few shakes of hot sauce per some other reviews and with a little cheese on top, it's the perfect antidote to cold winter days!

"This is the best chili I've ever had" said my husband, who has very high standards and was pretty pessimistic when he saw the ingredient list!  I added a fresh jalapeno (without the seeds), beans as suggested by others, and some extra tomato paste (I like it thick).  Good and harty!

This recipe is really good and is now permanently in my recipe box. I added black beans (rinsed and drained) and corn, I used seasoned crushed tomatoes.  I served it with a dollup of sour cream, cheddar cheese, and tortilla chips

Wow, if you didn't include the chopped green chiles and the zucchini, then you did not make this recipe, you made some other recipe.  Those two ingredients seem pretty integral to this dish, considering the thousands of chili recipes that exist, all pretty much the same as the next.  ...Anyway, I made this Terrific Turkey Chili and it was delicious and a really nice change!  The zucchini is a great addition.

Awesomely simple recipe, with lots of room for customization. By itself, it's a fantastic recipe, but the true strength lies in the ability to add things to your hearts content.
I personally doubled the recipe, and added the following ingrediants:
3 medium red peppers, diced; 3 medium carrots, diced; one red onion and one yellow onion (instead of two yellow), diced; 2 shallots, minced; 4 medium jalapenos (instead of canned green chili's); 1 can garbanzo beans; 1 can kidney beans;
Sauteed the carrots for about 5 minutes on high, stirring occasionally. Then added the green and red peppers for a few minutes, and finally threw the onions and shallots in to finish till they were translucent. Jalapeno's I threw in a pot with vinegar till it started boiling, then boiled for about 5 minutes. Take the peppers off the stove and blend them together with some fresh garlic and some of the crushed tomatos (adding some vinegar to get it to a slurry). Added all the veggies and jalapeno slurry at the time the recipe calls for (including the chick peas/beans), and moved to the crock pot on high for 2 hours. Add a water/flour slurry (approximately 1 tbsp of each, double that if a thicker chili is desired) to the crock pot, mix thoroughly, and cook on low overnight. I actually had about 3 lbs of jalapenos, so I made a lot of extra slurry on the side to add as desired. Plan on making it much more often now that I have this incredibly simple recipe (planned for Christmas dinner).

I usually freeze leftover chili for an easy meal later, this stuff won't make it to the freezer! So good! I did substitute the tomatoes and green chillis for 2 cans of rotel, added some yellow squash in place of some of the zucchini, added corn, 1 can of black beans and 1 can of kidney beans. Instead of adding water when it got too thick I kept adding beef broth as I buy cartons of it, not cans.

This recipe was super easy and super delicious, it's a nice base to a turkey chili recipe. Like the other reviews, I added a can of black beans and put everything in a slow cooker after browning the ground turkey with all the seasonings. There were things I did not added like the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, zucchini and green chile peppers and it still came out delicious. People were coming back for thirds and asked for th recipe.

This was a great chili and it comes together very easily.  I am not used to adding so many "prepared" ingredients, such as the taco seasoning and the salsa, but it worked out great.   I wanted something with a little more body, so I added a can of drained kidney beans and left out the zucchini.  Definitely will repeat.

Absolutely delicious.  I was very weary of using taco seasoning, since I didn't want a taco-flavored soup.  You'd never know it was in there.  The seasoning added the perfect blend of spices and spice.  I skipped the zucchini because I didn't have one, and added 2 cans of diced tomatoes for texture.  10 people watching football on a cozy Sunday all raved.  Thank you for the perfect chili recipe!

I thought this was very good chili.  It's wasn't as spicy as I usually make but it had very good flavor and I didn't have to fight with the kids to eat their food.  I added a can of garbanzo and black beans.  I'd probably replace the garbanzo beans with kidney or pinto beans next time.

Overall, a great dish. My only complaint was the salsa - I felt it overpowered the dish a bit. The second time I made it I reduced the salsa by ~ 1/3 and it was much better.

This chili is the only recipe I use now. It is healthy and has tons of flavor. It is the recipe that my fiance requests most often.
I add a can each of pinto and black beans.

This is the tastiest chili I've ever made.  I think this will become a favorite in our home.  My husband doesn't like "hot-spicy", so I omitted the green chile peppers & chili pepper flakes, & it was delicious.  It's a welcome change from the usual chili recipes.  I served it over rice & found it substantial without the beans.  I think the key to this recipe's rich flavor is the beef broth.  I recommend using a brand without MSG, such as Kitchen Basics Beef Stock (that's what I used).

I'm not a ground turkey fan, but this tasted good. I added 1 can of kidney beans and about 1 cup of frozen corn.

This recipe was very good.  It has an excellent flavor. 

I made the following changes:
- cooked onion first and added garlic.  Browned the meat with the onion & garlic to enhance flavor
- added about 1tb brown sugar....this was so key!
- added CORN - so delicious!!
- served with fat free sour cream mixed with scallions, yellow rice, and more corn kernels.  And of course Coronas!

It's very good, but as written, very hot. I used chipotle pepper flakes, med salsa, black beans.  Haven't put the zucchini in yet...

This was a really great recipe. I kept the basic spice ingredients for flavor but made some modifications: I used 80/20 beef so I did not need vegetable oil; I did not use the one can of crushed tomatos or green chilis because I did not have on hand--instead, I used a 7 oz. can of diced tomatos *with green chiles; used only 1 zucchini.
I also added one can of chili-seasoned beans and more spices for heat(about 1 tsp each of crushed red pepper and chili powder). 
Great recipe to “play” with. With the basic ingredients (taco seasoning, spices and salsa), you cannot go wrong by adding or omitting different veggies (I am not a fan of bell pepper so I left that out and also used about ¼ onion). You can also choose different types of salsa-I used Southwestern made with corn and black beans. The tomato paste may also not be necessary—I rarely use paste so it was a waste for me to only use a little bit and then have to throw the rest of the can out.

This was really yummy!  I too like chili to be hot so I used the "hot" chili seasoning packet and a little chili powder.  The zucchini was delicious.  Other reviews complained about the chili being too thin and soupy, so they suggested adding beans, veggies, etc.  I added black beans, corn, and garbanzos, but it was still a little more soupy than I like chili to be.  Next time I may stir in some corn starch or replace the can of crushed tomatoes with a can of tomato sauce.

I had never made Turkey Chili because I thought it wouldn't have as much flavor as chili made with beef.  I was wrong...this is not only the best Turkey Chili I've ever eaten, it may rank among my favorite chili recipes.  Period.  Since I only had 1 lb of turkey I did add a can of chili beans.  I also browned the onion along with the turkey and diced the zucchini so that it could simmer and cook.  At least that eliminated the need to wash another skillet...

Fantastic recipe!!
I added some dark red kidney beans to give it some more texture, this has to be the best chili recipe I've found, my husband loves it, even my daughter ate it! I've given out this recipe to 3 friends also, I'll be using this regularly!

Love this chili.  I haven't made it for a few years but I stumbled upon this recipe again and it was just as good as I remember.  I did change it up a bit though.  My husband doesn't care for zucchini so I omitted that.  I used one can of corn, chili beans and black beans instead of the zucchini so keep a thicker consistency.  I only had chicken broth at home so I used that instead of the beef broth, I also didn't have any vegetable oil so I replaced it with olive oil.  We like our food spicy so I used 1/2 a can of green chile peppers and 1/2 a can of jalapeno peppers.  Even though I changed it up a bit it is still amazing!

This is the perfect 'feel good' recipe for a cold day!  It is easy to whip up for company and delicious for leftovers.  I eliminated any super spicy ingredients (i.e. the chili peppers) and used kidneys instead of garbanzos.  It was a hit!

Excellent!!  I made this chili without adding anything and it came out perfect.   I really liked having the zucchini in the chili.  I ended up using left over roasted garlic salsa by Newman's Own which gave the chili a lot more flavor!!

I added beans. That's it. It's delicious as is and I got rave reviews from a very picky chili loving boyfriend. I will make this again, and will not make any changes. I try to always stick to the recipe the first time I make it, then make changes. This recipe requires no changes. (except for the addition of beans)

Tasted too much like spaghetti sauce until I added chili powder, cumin, garlic powder and kidney beans.  Not sure I'll make this again.

This recipe not only deserved its 5 star rating............it really WAS "TERRIFIC".  Followed the recipe as written but took the advice of others who suggested adding kidney beans and/or corn. We added both. Made a huge potful so lots of leftovers.  Have a feeling this is going to be one of those recipes that is even better the next day...........though it was great today.  Oh, btw, don't skip on the green onions, cheese and sour cream.  They really add to the flavor.

The ingredients regarding portion sizes available in stores here are as follows: Turkey - 20 oz. frozen; taco seasoning -- just add a pkg. rounded to an oz.; broth 14 - 20 oz. works fine; can up the broth in place of part of the water. In other words don't let larger purchased quantities go to waste. A little more here or there makes no taste difference.

The arrangement of this recipe should be changed as follows: Chop the vegetables first. Brown the turkey. Add ALL spices and the broth -- bring to a boil and then simmer 4 minutes. Now, in your empty skillet, brown the onions and pepper. Toss into a kettle along with the turkey. 
Bring to a simmer. Brown the zuke. Toss into kettle. 

Now for added pleasure, as one remarkable woman suggested, add 3 minced garlic simmered just briefly. Add a cup or so of frozen corn. Add a can of black beans (rinsed). Add a tablespoon of brown sugar. Stir.

Now, everything should be in the kettle that has been simmering. Simmer an additional 15 minutes. Now wasn't that easy and well organized? 

Smiling right at you, Vaughn

Tasty! Followed it to the letter, added more tomatoe and thinned with a littke extra beef broth....oh and added some cumin. Could have used a tad more heat, but great recipie that seems very forgiving to a twist here and there. Loved the addition of zucchini!  By far one of the best turkey chilli recipies!

It was one of those days and I spaced the directions..ended up cooking the turkey and then throwing everything in the pot to simmer.  Turned out super tasty!  Used Mexican oregano and didn't put in the ground red pepper,still had a nice kick but was not spicey,spicey. Keeper!  Will follow the directions next time.  :)

I made this today for my husband and I since it was a cold snowy day and we needed something warm. I did not have zucchini so I added a can of pinto beans and a can of kidney beans at the end (drained). I didn't have green chilies so I added one can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos and I used water instead of broth. I used Emeril's Southwest Seasoning instead of taco seasoning. It was very good and flavorful and very easy to prepare.

I usually don't pat myself on the back but this turned out to be an awesome meal!!! :)  I added kidney beans to it as well!  It was nice and hearty, not too spicy and just SOO good!!  Loved the cheese and sour cream added to it!

This recipe is awesome!!  We love it and now it's a family staple.  I even served it to my son's cub scout campout and a few people said it was the best chili they had ever had.  The changes I made are as follows:  I left out the zucchini, added both a can of each black beans and kidney beans (drained and rinsed) and added minced garlic.  I browned the turkey in a skillet and added it, and all the remaining ingredients to a crock pot and cooked on low for 4-5 hours or high for 2-3 hours.  Very tasty!

After trying this recipe.. i will never try another chili recipe. This was literally the first time I ever attempted to make chili and it was a success! I did make a few adjustments. I used 1/2 tsp of coriander and 1/2 tsp of cumin because I love cumin and didn't really know what coriander tastes like. I also left out the tomato paste and used a splash of the beef broth to mix in the spices. I used 2 onions because my fiance and I LOVE onions. I also added 1 can of black beans and 1 can of kidney beans.. then threw it all into the crockpot for a few hours after it was all combined! Next time I will do a can of chili beans instead of kidney beans. My chili recipe for life! Thanks for sharing!!

This is the BEST chili I have ever had!  I did not change a thing. EXCELLENT!  I did just basically throw everything in the pot and slow cooked it for 4 hours. Just excellent! Did not use cheese, sour cream or green onions  to top. Excellent without it!!!!!!!!

Really great, really easy, really healthy recipe.  I agree with many other reviewers in that a couple additions are necessary.  I added 1 can of corn and 1 can of kidney beans, but any bean would work.  I did fully brown the meat and add the can of beef broth before adding the spices (taco seasonings thru pepper flakes) as I felt the spices without the broth would burn the pan.  I do advise cooking it several hours in advance and letting it simmer so favors can mix.  I also added a couple shakes of Tabasco as I like spicy.  Thank you Big Surprise for a great recipe that's a keeper!

Really great and easy chili! I look for interesting and chunky salsa. I also omit the coriander, green chillies and green pepper. I add in a drained can of Rotel and some caned corn.

This Chili recipe is wonderful. I've been searching for many years for the perfect chili recipe. Not necessary with turkey either. This flavor is so zesty and good. I did add 1 can of black beans and 1 can of kidney beans. Omitted the zuchini just because my younger ones aren't into that. It turned out fabulous. Definitely will save this recipe. I served over rice!~ Woot!~ Awesome.

Oh man this was amazing, the hubby loved it too. Added frozen corn, kidney beans, and blacks beans. Also added the whole little can of tomato paste because I didn't want it hanging out in the fridge for who knows how long. Everything else left the same, so yummy!! Will definitely make again for sure.

Have made this a few times and it's ALWAYS a hit! It's such a filling chili, no one can tell it's not beef. Like other reviewers, I added a can of corn and a can of red kidney beans. Serve this with cornbread and no one will be disappointed!

This was my first attempt at making chilli, and OMG was it good. I can't wait to make it again! I left out the onion (allergies) and added a can each of black and kidney beans to make it a bit more chunky. I also followed the directions of another reviewer and used a crock pot. I cooked the turkey with all of the spices as directed in the recipe and then threw it in the crock pot with everything else on high for 4 hours. YUM!

Excellent, easy and delicious.  Definitely add a couple of cans of beans but otherwise, don't change a thing!  And if you are counting calories, the nutrition breakdown includes the cheese and sour cream.  Without those things, this recipe is between 225-300 calories per serving! :)

Very good turkey chili recipe, loved the texture that the zucchini and green pepper brought to the chili.  Definitely recommend adding a can of beans as well.  I still thought it was lacking somewhat in the spice dept., so I added cayenne pepper; that wasn't it so I followed another reviewers suggestion and added a little brown sugar to taste and that did the trick.  (I'm from Cincinnati, we like a little sweetness to our chili).  Overall an excellent recipe that you can adjust to your own liking.

Great recipe, especially good for using up extra zukes from the garden.  A few additions really upped the ante and added complexity to the flavor:  I added 3 cloves of crushed garlic, 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of chipotle spice, 1 bottle of beer, 1 Tbsp each of worchestershire and tamari sauce,  1 can each of whote and red kidney beans, 1 can chickpeas, 1 can black beans, 1 small can of tomato paste, some chopped tomatoes I had hanging around the kitchen, 1 cup of leftover coffee and 1 small can of tomato sauce to thicken. I also browned the turkey with some chopped hickory bacon.  After browning the meat, I added everything else in no particular order, except for the tomato sauce and paste which I added at the end (just add what you need).

Just won a blue ribbon at our church chili cook-off using a modified version of this recipe.  Used beef instead of turkey.  Omitted green onions and zuchinni and also followed some of the other recommendations:  added 1 can of cannalini beans, 1 can of red beans, 1 can on black beans, 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 jar of pasta sauce.  Also used full can of tomato paste.  Over $300 was raised for our missions ministry at our event.

Great recipe. I added a can of red kidney beans. It's a little watery than I expected. But the flavor was awsome. Taco mix really helps.

Yum! Very thick and flavorful.  i added black & white beans, about a teaspoon of minced garlic, and  chopped fresh jalapeno.  Subbed some tomato sauce for the tomato paste, a packet of au jus with water for the beef broth (out of broth, but I would go with broth next time), and used only about half the onion & green pepper, both finely chopped.

Excellent!

I added a 30 oz can of chili beans and 3 additional cups of chicken stock.  I also added a Bhut Jolokia pepper (one small, no seeds).  Used a bean and corn based salsa.

Really liked this a lot.  My 4 yr old who never had Chili before, said "Chili is my favorite!"  Also added beans per the reviews, no chili pepper flakes and topped with cheese.  Loved that I used zuccini in this

awesome! I served this and there wasn't one drop left. I doubled the recipe and replaced one packet of taco seasoning for spicy taco seasoning, I also added a couple cans of chopped tomatoes and one can of chopped tomatoes with chile peppers for a little more spice and substance.

Delicious and easy to make.  The kids loved it and so did hubby.  You would never know it was made with low fat turkey.  I cut back on the amount of zucchini and then wished I hadn't done so.  I also added kidney beans and used medium salsa.  I made it with Grandmother's buttermilk corn bread and white rice.  The kids cant wait to eat it for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love that this recipe has zucchini in it.  I rarely make a recipe as written...this one came out perfectly!  I topped it with loads of scallions, cilantro, queso fresco, and a small dollop of sour cream.  Excellent!

I used 1/2 turkey sausage and 1/2 beef to make the 1 1/2 lbs. I also added a bit more tomato paste, and regular chopped tomatoes (all I had on hand) and it turned out wonderfully. Also added one can of chili beans (like my chili with beans!) Easy to alter for your taste and how hot you like it! My husband loved it.

Fantastic flavor! Only changes I made were using chili powder instead of the chili pepper flakes and using 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chili peppers instead of the can of crushed tomatoes and the can of chopped green chili peppers. This is definitely a keeper and will make it into the dinner rotation. Usually I don't like soups or stews until the second day when the flavors have had a chance to meld, this one was fantastic on day one.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I must say the prep time took more than 15 minutes.  There are many vegetables needing to be diced and chopped.  But it's still fairly simple.  Everyone in my family LOVED this, including the hard to please men!

Hubby loved it and so did I. That says a lot, because it means it struck the right balance spice-wise. He usually likes things much spicier than I do. Will make this again!

Per the prior reviews, I added beans (garbanzo, black, and kidney) to the recipe and it turned out incredibly hearty and delicious.  It was my first attempt at chili and the outcome made it seem as though I've made it for years and years.  Guests loved it and asked to take it home.  The chili tastes even better the following day when the flavors marinate through the meat and veggies.

The best turkey chili I've ever made or had! I doubled the recipe because ground turkey was on sale at the store and I am really glad that I did because this recipe is a keeper.  I made the recipe as written and didn't have any problems with it being soupy.      I think this will be a great chili to serve for casual parties, with a topping bar, a crisp salad, and some warm cornbread.

This chili is excellent!  I recommend cutting the zucchinis in quarters for easier bites...and using small zuc's to avoid seeds.  The toppings are a must.  We wished we doubled the recipe so back to the store I go!

Easily the best chili I've ever made!  The flavor was awesome!  I have to watch my sodium intake so just used low sodium options and it was still fantastic!   I followed the advice of other reviewers and left out the zucchini but added a can of drained kidney beans and a can of drained corn.  I also only used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and a 4ounce can of diced green chiles so that it wasn't too spicy.  If you like spicy food though, leave the whole amount in....I would have if my husband liked spicy food.  Will make this over and over.  Thanks!

Very, very good.  A keeper for sure. Loved the addition of zucchini - I 1/4'd the zuc & then cut it into smaller cubes.  Wonderful combination of flavors.

It was so delicious! I had cut down the spicy ingredients (based on other peoples' reviews saying it was really spicy), and added chick peas and kidney beans like a lot of the other users. It was a huge hit with my dinner party, and they even took home leftovers! Thank you for this awesome recipe!

We loved this recipe. I took the advice of others and added black beans, chili beans, and red beans. I also added an extra can of green chiles and an extra can of tomatoes. The meat had great flavor but the liquid seemed to lack a little flavor so I added cumin, nutmeg, chili powder, cayenne, and dried cilantro. I through it all in a slow cooker and let the flavors cook through for a few hours. My boyfriend said it was the best chili we've ever made!

This chili is fantastic!  I just ate a bowl of leftovers for lunch.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 b/c I changed up the recipe a bit.  You can change up some ingredients to your liking.  I left out the zuccini and added 1 can of kidney beans + 1 can of corn, both drained.  I also left out the tomato paste b/c I didn't have any but if you simmer the chili long enough, it will reduce to your desired consistency.  I also had leftover chiopotles in adobo sauce and added two of those. SO GOOD!

Yum!!  We just loved this recipe.  I added 1 cup of frozen corn to give it a little crunch but it would have been great without that too.  I much prefer this to the bean-filled versions!

This IS my favourite chili recipe; in fact, it is now my ONLY chili recipe! With my husband not able to eat beef, and neither of us being huge fans of typical kidney bean-filled chili, we LOVED this recipe! We've been fighting over who gets the leftovers! Prepared everything exactly as stated, and it was perfect. This will be made over and over, only sometimes I will really cut down on the chili pepper flakes as it was too spicy for the kids... Perfect for me, but a little too much for kids. Can't thank-you enough for this recipe!

I was shocked at the high ratings once I tasted it. I just don't understand why so many liked it. It had no flavor, and yes I followed the recipe exactly. After 2 hours in the slow cooker I tasted it and it didn't taste like anything more than a homemade pasta sauce, not at all what I expected with all the ingredients and spices. I then added some minced garlic, garlic powder, pepper, and chili powder. I also added 3 different types of canned beans. A couple hours later I was still very disappointed with the lack of flavor. Only 1 out of the 7 of us liked it. Will not be making again.

Yum! I used mild green chile peppers and salsa but still added the red pepper flakes and it had the perfect amount of kick while still getting my picky 5 year old to eat it. Great recipe! I also added half a can of garbanzo beans and a whole can of red beans drained. Very good served over Fritos!!

Great flavor!  I made a triple batch.  I didn't have tomato paste or the veggies, but I added two cans of black beans, a bit of sea salt and onion powder.  I served it with sharp cheddar cheese and corn chips.  Delicious!

WOW is this good chili!  I followed the recipe except I cooked it in a slow cooker for 4 hours and added 2 cans of rinsed kidney beans in the last hour.  Delicious.  A keeper for sure.

My family loves this recipe and i never used all ingredients as i did not have on hand. I did not use tomato paste or bell pepper and zucchini and once used fajita seasoning as i did not have taco...you really cannot mess this recipe up it is solid.  I also cook the turkey with 3 minced garlic cloves and chopped onion before adding to crock pot.

Hi!
I thought this recipe was very good - what I did after I read the critiques where it was "watery" was to hold the broth - I used every other ingredient.  It was thick, a bit spicy, and very good.
Hold the broth!!

I made this chili for a 4th of July Potluck (a week ago). OMG it was amazing and everyone including the kids loved it. I have already been asked to prepare it again this weekend. For the most part I stayed true to the recipe. I did double the recipe and add two cans kidney beans, one can garbanzo beans and a can of black beans. I also added more beef broth to loosen it up a bit. It was incredible!!! If your not a turkey lover I encourage you to try it with turkey before you use ground beef because the flavor is so rich that you cant even tell that it is made with turkey. Top with shredded cheddar cheese and enjoy!!

Best chili I've ever made.  I omitted the green chilis as I couldn't find any in the store.  I added the spices and tomato paste to the meat at the early stage of browning as the recipe was unclear if spices went in before, during, or after browning.  It made the meat really finely crumbled and delicious.  I also added two cans of rinsed and drained beans at the final stage with the zucchini.  I used sodium reduced taco seasoning and broth to shave out some salt, and make the dish even healthier.

Added a can of retried beans, red (instead of green) pepper, 2 lg. tomatoes ( for the salsa), left out the zucchini (only bc husband doesn't like), also added few shakes of chili powder, and cumin powder along with all the spices suggested.  This recipe is a keeper.  Added bit of shredded cheddar and dalop of sour cream. So GOOD!  p.s.  if I'd had canned beans on hand would have added those also.  Really like the consistency that the retried beans gave to this dish.  Quick to make also .  ENJOY,

My husband and I found this recipe to be extremely salty. Taco seasonong mix is loaded with sodium, and all the canned ingredients have their own salt, especially the salsa & broth. When this was done it was too salty for us to eat. But the flavor was good, in the future I would not use taco seasoning mix at all, just cumin & chili powder with the other recipe seasonings - and low sodium broth. You can always add salt to taste at the end.

Fantastic. I love this easy  yummy recipe. I always add 2 can of beans ( kidney black whatever)  - ive never not done this, but wouldnt want to try. I brown the turkey with the taco seasoning and throw everything in a slow cooker. Turns out great every time.  I pair this with corn bread and slaw and it makes a perfect meal to take to a  sick friend

Great chili! Only mistake was putting in too many cans of beans. Next time I'll make it bean-less or with only one small can of beans.

Excellent! Did not have tomato paste so used equal measure of catsup. Added beans for personal taste and a smidge of cinnamon and garlic (sautéed 3 garlic cloves w/onion). This is an excellent base recipe for turkey chili and can easily be tailored to suit individual tastes

I felt this was a very good chili. It was simple to make and had plenty of seasonings. It was, however, quite lacking in its punch, so adding some chili powder or something a bit hotter would definitely help this out. It also had no beans listed in the recipe, so I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added 2 cans of red kidney beans and a can of black beans. It was definitely simple to make, which I very much appreciate.

Five stars.  This is some healthy and satisfying chili.  I made it to put on chili dogs.  Killer! I highly recommend using the taco seasoning mix recipe from this site- tasty and preservative free.

We love this recipe for turkey chili! My kids (before this) hated chili and now will actually request it! It is the only chili that doesn't give me heartburn. My husband adds in a can or two of kidney beans as he can't do chili without them but it doesn't hurt the flavor of this! YUM!

Love this chili! Originally made this for my zucchini, pepper, onion and tomato hating hubby and he said he wouldn't try it but since we were trying to eat lower carb he agreed to "try" it. He loved it and actually said that he likes it more than regular chili. It is time consuming to make but worth it. Don't even try to change the ingredients or not do the steps in order.....I've tried both of those and failed. There is a reason that the order is important and the ingredients are too. It is very filling and healthy too. Beans are good for you but also high in calories and carbs so this is a nice alternative.

wonderful.  I added drained can of kidney beans and black beans and used drained diced tomatoes and just added some paste to it to taste/texture.  Next time I will leave out the zucchini though because don't think it made a difference.

Great Chili. Has a very fresh taste. The only change I made was adding one can of mixed beans. Could use more kick as it wasn't spicy at all.

I don't usually like chili, but I LOVE this one.  It's more of a taco chili than a regular chili.  I did not add the zucchini, though, as it sounded like a weird vegetable to add to chili.  My husband agreed.  I did add one can of pinto beans as that seems more chili like than zucchini.  I used low sodium beef broth & found the chili plenty salty. I also left out the chili flakes & used hot salsa instead.  I will definitely be making this chili again.

I made this tonight and I think it is just okay.  I basically followed the recipe exactly, only leaving out the zuchinni. It must be the taco seasonong, but to me it tasted exactly like a taco.  So I might as well of wrapped it in a tortilla and called it a taco. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good just not like how I think chili should taste.

This is so, so delicious!  Doubled the recipe and made it exactly as instructed, excep that I did add some dashes of tabasco sauce to bring up the heat.  Had I used a medium salsa instead of mild, that might've been enough.  Absolutely scrumptious, and even better leftover.

This was great. I like spicy. Added chili powder and a habanero, but I also did not use canned green chilis or salsa. I used fresh sweet peppers from my garden. Added garbanzo beans. Sauteed carrot sticks with the zuccinni. It was refreshing, but comforting.

I was making this for kids so I omitted the green chilis and used just a pinch of red pepper flakes. It had just a perfect slight kick. I also added a tbsp of brown sugar. It was very flavorful and everyone loved it!

I made two small changes - less zuchini (because I'm the only one in my family that would eat that part) and instead of the green chilis I chopped up a medium sized canned chipotle and added that with about a tablespoon of the canned adobe sauce.  My son, who is a chili con carne traditionalist, said this was the best chili he'd ever tasted.  My husband said it was even better on the second day.

Excellent recipe - lots of flavor.  Like others, I added two cans of drained beans, some frozen corn, and a bit of brown sugar.  It was actually a lot of fun to make because my husband doesn't like things spicy, so we each made 1/2 the recipe in our own pot and he could decide what he wanted to add or not!  We each liked our version the best (mine was truer to the recipe) and he learned to appreciate the chili more having "created" it.

Great recipe!  I added garbanzo and kidney beans like the other reviewers suggested.  Next time I will add a couple of jalapeños to spice it up, and I will omit the zucchini because it became mushy when the chili was reheated.

This chili is GREAT!!  I let my son test taste it and he told me something was missing! I asked him what and he said a bowl was missing because he wanted more.  I loved hearing that.  I added the black beans, cannellini beans and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  The hot from the peppers with the sweet from the sugar worked well together.  Enjoy!

this is good chili--but sour cream and cheese are obviously both dairy products.  recipe should be in an other section.

Very good.  Made only minor changes.  Used 1.5 lbs of leftover, diced, cooked turkey instead of ground turkey.  Used 1/2 t chipotle chili powder is place of the chili pepper flakes.  Also, diced one zucchini (all I had on hand) and sauted it together with the onion and green pepper to save a step.  Added canned garbonzo beans at the end as recommended.  It's a keeper!

Tastes good if you like spicy. A little labor intensive to make. Somebody told me to microwave pepper and onions instead of browning them - not sure what kind of difference that would make.

This is a five star recipe for sure. After reading notes from other members I added one can of black beans and one can of corn, both drained. I substituted the canned salsa with Jardine’s Roasted Campfire salsa. The chili turned out absolutely delicious, hearty yet light. Both my husband and I had two servings because we enjoyed the flavors so much. We tried it with the suggested shredded cheddar and sour cream as well as without it. The recipe is savory in itself that it doesn’t need it if you want to cut out a few calories. With the additions of beans and corn this serves approx. 9.

Delicious! I was a bit sceptical about the taco seasoning, but it was perfectly seasoned. I used a can of tomato sauce instead of crushed and threw in a 19 oz can of black beans. I used only one zucchini and sautéed all the vegetables together. Will definitely make this again.

This is fantastic. It has a bit too much heat for us, so I would cut the red pepper flakes down to 1/2 tsp.  My husband ate two huge bowls and he is not a zucchini fan.

I love chili but traditional recipes that contain beans usually upset my stomach. This recipe is absolutely delicious and has a bit of zing without being too spicy. Also, because its made with ground turkey and zucchini, it is a lower calorie option.

This recipe IS terrific but with modifications. I added black beans and chick peas to mine. I also cooked it with beef bone broth and I used a red pepper instead of zucchini.  Also, lots of garlic.  The end result was 5 stars!

Really tasty. Easy to make. My wife was a little thrown off by the zucchini. Next time she wants to swap it out for beans. But the flavor is really good. Perfect on a potatoe or corn dog.

My family loved this chili! I did make some changes... left out the zucchini and green bell peppers (my kids don't like them) and left out the coriander (we didn't have it). I also added a can of kidney beans, a can of garbanzo beans, 2 tbsp. of brown sugar, and 2 tbsp. of plain greek yogurt (sour cream would have worked the same). It was perfect for adults!!! So yummy! Next time I'll make it without the chili flakes in order to tone down the spice for my kids. I may also put the onions in the food processor instead of chopping them and do a 4oz. can of diced green chilis instead of 7oz because of the kids. Such an  easy and healthy recipe.

Awesome but I made without zucchini, added pinto & black beans, fresh tomato, chili & cayenne pepper, parsley & pepper with multi grain crackers, Not that I am a bad cook but for the first time EVER making chili, it came out GREAT! I believe because the recipe was simple and easy to follow!

This recipe lived up to its name-it really us terrific! There is absolutely nothing I would change. I loved that it uses turkey, which is low fat, and I thought the zucchini was an excellent addition! My husband and I both loved this and I will definitely make it again!

This was the first time I made chili and I really liked this recipe.  I liked the fact that it was turkey instead of beef. I had to tweak it a little and added, according to some reviews, 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Overall, great recipe!

Never made turkey chili before, and this was great. Even my husband who does not like turkey chili loved it. After having it for dinner and lunch, he wanted more. I did modify it a little.  reduced the level of spicy due to the fact that my husband does not like spicy food. It was still delicious. This one is a keeper!

Made this and it was really tasty. Mine wasn't as thick as I'd like so after we had a couple bowls I added another bag of corn, mushrooms, and beans. I could probably add another pound of turkey. I browned the turkey and threw everything into the crock pot which made this recipe easy. I plan to make this again. Thank you for this recipe and all of the reviews.

Made a double batch for Christmas Eve. Everyone loved it! I was a little worried that the "meat" eaters wouldn't like it but I doubt they noticed. I used chicken broth instead of beef broth.

I make this every year in anticipation of my out of towners coming in for the holiday. I  double it and scoop the chili into gallon zip lock bags and store flat in the freezer.
I make it differently all the time - but I do add about 2T chipotle sauce and sometimes a chipotle pepper finely chopped without seeds. I also add about 3 T brown sugar. This time I may or may not add black beans bc I added zucchini and the chili is pretty thick w/o them. My family is crazy about this recipe and it's easy to make ahead for cold winter nights!

This chili is bomb! I added black beans and kidney beans after reading a few recommendations. I was too weirded out by the zucchini to add it, but we didn't miss it a bit. Will definitely be making this a lot this winter.

I really like this recipe. I don't like all the steps to it. I brown my turkey with my onion, zucchini, red and orange bell pepper and I believe my preferred salsa really gives it the sweetness and zing that my family likes. As for the soupy texture, I cook it down to the thickness that we like. All easy fixes.

This recipe would have been good if it did not include zucchini. My husband didn't like the zucchini either, so I spent 10 minutes fishing zucchini out of the dutch oven so we would like the leftovers.

I made this for a potluck lunch at work. I added 1 additional can of black beans because it seemed a little thin without it.  Everyone loved this recipe and I received several compliments.  The only negative is that there are a lot of ingredients, so it required a little more shopping and prep time.

We were having a chili cook-off for charity at work and we didn't have enough entries, so I decided I would enter and try this recipe for the sake of the charity. I got so many compliments on it and actually tied for 1st place for People's Choice! I have made it twice at home since then and my family LOVES it!

Excellent recipe and lots of flavour.  I did add a can of kidney beans for more body and didn't have green chilies but was spicy enough.   My son didn't like the zucchini but most  people would! I'd definitely make this again.

It is a 10, even veggie- hating hubs loves this.  I most always make to recipe, sometimes add a can of beans.   Tonight I added 2 T chopped  roasted hatch chilis in place of the canned.  Never fails to satisfy.

I have made this chili many times. We love it!!  I always double it, add 4 cans pinto beans, and use the taco mixture in the pouches.  I spice it up a bit more as family likes heat.  Delicious chili recipe.  Highly recommend it!

Great recipe, I added some red pepper flakes and extra chili powder to give an additional kick. The sauce is a bit thin so adding red beans and mashing a handful will thicken the sauce. This recipe is near perfect!

This was fantastic! We used vegetable broth (had it on hand) and skipped the zucchini (personal preference). Very, very good chili! Will definitely keep this as my go-to chili recipe.

This chili is so good! I've made this recipe at least 15 times. I've made it exactly as it reads and sometimes I have omitted the zucchini and added beans instead. Both ways are excellent. I do let it sit on the stove on low for longer than 15 minutes in Step 4 only because I don't want to be cooking when the kids and husband get home. Maybe that's why I've never had a problem with the chili being runny as stated in some reviews? Everyone LOVES this chili. Very delicious! I did try it with beef once and found it to be a little on the rich side.

I did not care for this recipe. I found it to be extremely bland. Not only is it not at all spicy, but the flavor is just flat.  I added onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper, and cayenne, and now it is just acceptable, but not great.

This was really good! And easy. You don't miss the ground beef at all. I added a can of beans, 2 tsp chilli powder, 3 celery, 2 cups of corn, smoked cheddar cheese, and skipped the chillis and zucchini. I cooked it the night before and threw it in the slow cooker on low while I was at work for 8 hours.

It's delicious!  Today is my second time making it.  It has just the right spice to it.  The only thing I do is take away the green chile peppers and add a can of chili beans.  This lasts me a week and if it's too much just freeze for another day.

This recipe was awesome!!  I made several changes because i used what i had, but they all had seconds!  Instead of taco seasonings, i used quesadilla seasonings.  I didnt used zucchini but threw in black beans, kidney beans, and 1/2 can great northern beans.  I added garlic salt, chili powder, and a bit of onion powder. I didnt have beef broth so used turkey broth.  You have to use canned tomatoes so i had some diced canned tomatoes.  I topped it with shredded colby jack and sour cream and it was amazing!!  For those who need a heartier meal, cook some macaroni or other pasta and serve the chili on top!!

AMAZING !!  I couldn't love it more. Great recipe to add your on twists too. I added a little bit on garlic and cumin to the oil before I added the turkey( that always adds depth of flavor) I used a 32 oz carton of beef broth and didn't have to add more water. I added navy beans. Also a diced fresh jalapanios after cutting the green chili in half.  The longer it simmers the better it tastes !! Love what a hit.

Yum!!  Made this recipe and loved it!  I switched out the zucchini for eggplant (a relative of mine who joined for dinner cannot have them due to the oxalates) and loved it!  I also used a can of fire roasted tomatoes in place of regular ones.  It gives a great smoky flavor!  A can of black beans and one of red kidney beans in it with a big batch of corn bread on the side.  Mmmm....

Really good. I wanted to throw something in the Crockpot in the morning, so I started with this recipe. I omitted the bell pepper because I was lazy, used hot/spicy taco seasoning mix, added two drained cans of kidney beans, used vegetable broth instead of beef because that is what I had open, and omitted the tomato paste. I wish I had added the tomato paste to give the broth a little more tomato taste and thickness and will use it next time. I also did not brown the turkey first, as is usually advised for these kind of recipes. I think that may be why the final result looked a little strange, but it tasted great. A great flavor, some heat but not too spicy. It looks like a complicated recipe, because it has so many ingredients, but mostly it is just opening cans/jars and adding spices. If I make it in the Crockpot again, I will add the zucchini later. I added it at the beginning, with everything else, and it was overcooked. Otherwise, really solid recipe, will definitely make again.

Next time I will brown the meat lightly before adding the paste.  Added Garbonzo beans and kidney beans as well as a can of corn, okra, and tomatoes.  Turned out great!  Loved the zucchini in it!

This was excellent! I would give it 5 stars but my son (age 19) voted for 3, so I compromised. I added a can each of rinsed black & kidney beans. With Greek yogurt on top, it was amazing! Oh, I don't have coriander and my taco seasoning was homemade.

I liked this as a base-line recipe. I used traditional chili seasoning instead of taco seasoning and used 2 packets instead of 1. I also added cheyenne pepper and kidney beans for a more traditional chili feel.

Great recipe, and easy to follow! I made it already 4 times (strictly followed the directions), fiance keeps asking for it! Today, i made a few substitutions: I did not have the tomato paste, I used ketchup instead. Also, instead of the crushed tomatoes I used Ragu. It came out pretty much the same! Don't be afraid to experiment =)

We've tried dozens of turkey chilli recipes and this one ranks among the best. We really enjoyed the chunky zucchini and the zesty flavors, this one had everything. The only change we made was chicken broth for beef broth but I don't think that was noticeable. Seriously, if your looking for a good chili recipe, this one's a must!

Have made this several times just as written except for adding a can of rinsed drained garbanzo beans  toward the end of cooking.  I love the mix of spices.  Took it to a tailgate and had requests for the recipe.  This one is a winner; even better the next day as leftovers for lunch.

Chili with no beans and no chili powder didn't cut it. I prefer a more traditional chili.

Amazing recipe.  I will never go back to making chilli with beef again.  Only made a few modifications for personal preference.  Added celery, mushrooms, medley of beans and crushed garlic.  Next time I will only use a half a teaspoon of chilli flakes because I found this to be on the brink of being too spicy.  Since it was a little too spicy for my liking I added a few unsweetened chocolate chips to melt and neutralize the spice.  Turned out perfect.  My boyfriend said it was the best chilli he's ever had.  Served it in a bread bowl with melted cheddar cheese, dollop of sour cream and green onions sprinkled on top. BOMB!!

Love this chili!  Extremely easy and has great flavor! Made it for a party we had with a chili bar and everyone was asking for the recipe! Have already made it twice and will definitely make it again to freeze for the winter!

Haven't made this yet, but plan to for thanksgiving dinner (canada is tommorrow). i know eh?  my son luvs tacos, and i'm not crazy about turkey anyway. so this should be a nice hearty warm meal cause it's cold outside!  just making a note that i think the reason the beans were left out was to keep it LOWCARB. or maybe it's a regional preferance, texans don't normally use beans.  either way, if you are lowcarbing it, omit the beans or use black soy ones.

This recipe is SO good! I made it for a group of friends last night and it was a huge hit!!! Everyone loved it and some even ate it with the "grandma's cornbread" mixed in!

I did change some things... as other reviewers have mentioned, I thought it helped to add a full can of tomato paste and some garlic. I also love beans in chili and decided to add one can of each pinto and black beans which really helped thicken out the chili! In addition, I added a full can of corn, a couple carrots, did just one larger zucchini, and did one red and one yellow bell pepper instead of the green.

I am sure you could customize this recipe a lot and it would be just as delicious! It just depends on your preferences. I think this was one of the best chilis I have ever had and would highly recommend trying it! It was great for the party too because I made it early in the afternoon and let it simmer until guests arrived... it had a chance to develop the flavors a little more and made the timing of feeding everyone a snap! Served it up with the "grandma's cornbread" recipe, and some cheddar cheese, sour cream, and sliced green onions. YUM!!! 

Will definitely be making this again! Thanks :)

What a different recipe! Fantastic flavor and texture.  But even better when refrigerated overnight.  I substituted a small can of corn, a small can of red kidney beans, and a large can of white cannellini beans, I left out the coriander and chili pepper flakes.  Also put two tablespoons of granulated sugar into the broth to develop the flavors.  The taco seasoning packet carries the dish very nicely. Mild bite as far as the heat goes, perfect balance. Can't say enough about this chili.  Best way to utilize ground turkey as a lean meal instead of the traditional beef.

My husband never missed the beef!  I couldn't believe it!  I used very lean turkey and made my own "taco seasoning"....onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, ground cumin, salt, pepper. I used a red bell because that is what i had. I left out the red pepper flakes.  Next time, I will omit the salsa and use an extra can of tomato sauce, or something.  I could taste salsa in there.  It took away from the chili flavor.  Not to mention, it made it too spicy for my 8 and 5 yo kids to eat. topped with cheese, green onion and avocado!  Will definitely make again!  Love the zucchini in there.  Who would have thought!

I made this recipe last night and I am VERY pleased with it. I am no chef by far and as I was cutting the vegetables up I got a chance to see that even more. I omitted some of the ingredients because my supermarket didn't have them (green onions, coriander, and tomato paste). I also forgot to add the diced tomatoes and I didn't have tomato paste so I used a small can of tomato sauce. Maybe there is a big difference but I doubt I would taste it as much. Also, I used a peppercorn blend that had coriander in it because there was no coriander available. Everything worked out well with cooking the ingredients together. The only thing I would say is if you don't like big chunks of veggies, make sure you dice everything up finely. My zucchini's were cut fairly big but it's fine now because they soften up after all the cooking is done and almost melt in your mouth. 

All in all, great recipe! And like someone said, it does make "tons" and is good to freeze for later if you want some for a night and then need to make something else for the next day.

I'm a new mom (age 36) and just learning how to cook!  I tried this recipe, it took me a while to find all of the spices as I didn't own a single one of them ahead of time.  I love spicy food and beans, so I used this recipe but added a can of black beans, a can of garbonzo beans and a can of kidney beans.  I also added a TON of hot sauce (we love Tapatio sauce) to taste.  It was so spicy it made my nose run.....just the way I like it.  :)  I loved the chunks of zucchini, never had them in chili before.  Hearty and healthy!

I entered this chili in a chili contest and it won best out of 6! Added a can of drained and rinsed white beans and black beans and 1/2 of a 14 oz can of corn.Also 1/2 tsp sale and 3/4 tsp of sugar. Besides being delicious it makes a really pretty chili.

This is the best chili recipe I've found. I made some modifications the first time because I didn't have all the ingredients and it was really good so I've continued to make it with these changes: one can black beans (1/2 of which are mashed), chicken broth with a beef flavor boost packet instead of beef broth and no zucchini. I serve it with black bean chips. It's become one of our favorite cold weather dishes.

I love this recipe! I've shared it with everyone. I only made two slight changes. I added one can of chili beans and used a packet of chili seasoning, rather than taco. I've made it 3 times and it's consistently delicious. My husband loves it. A perfect cold weather meal!

Since this wasn't a from-scratch recipe, I thought the ingredients list for this recipe was innovative; I really liked the idea of using salsa in the mix despite what my snobbish foodie uncle said about it. That said, it was much too mild and lacked some substance for my eaters. I kept the great base but added black beans and red kidney beans, and SPICE: 1 1/2 tbsp of chili powder, 1/2 tbsp garlic powder, and 2 dashes of my own dry spicy concoction.

Very good. I added one can each of black, garbanzo, and kidney beans. I omitted the bell pepper. I browned the meat and then threw it all in the crockpot on high for 3 hours. It came out fab!

I would've given this 5 stars but I altered it to make it better. I added beans like other reviewers have recommended and next time I will add corn as well. I also didn't taste a kick (I like spice) so I added more flakes and a teaspoon of extra spicy cayenne pepper. That did the job. This dish was SUPER easy to make and was quick if you were able to multitask. Really great chili.

Really really good turkey chili. I used homemade salsa from this site because I had some on hand. Added a little canned corn. Didnt add the green onions. Next time I might make it with shredded turkey or chicken because I like that better than ground turkey. Really good flavors! Thanks!

Just finished making this and love, love, love it! If you like your chili with a kick to it you will love this recipe. The only thing I did different was to add a can of dark kidney beans to it, otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. This is certainly a new favorite recipe and will be making it again, soon!

Fantastic! Sauted some onions and garlic before adding the turkey and added some sausage as well. Used just only two medium zucchinis (one green and one yellow). No green onion or chiles and substituted red for green bell pepper. Added Chef Paul's Fajita Magic instead of taco seasoning. Everyone LOVED it! Can't wait to have it again tomorrow! I'm sure it'll be twice as good! Thanks for the recipe!

Sooo good!! made a fast trip to the store and forgot  a couple things. I used about 4 oz. of tomato sauce because I forgot the paste, used chili powder cause i forgot the pepper flakes. added less broth due to the fact i used tomato sauce. I also added kidney beans and only veggie added was onion. Also added chili beans. This was one of the best chili's I've ever made... Thanks!!!

I've made this recipe 5 times and it's a keeper.  I don't have to be perfect on the ingredients.  Like beef broth.  My sisterinlaw is vegetarian so we substituted vegetable broth & noticed little difference.  Still haven't made it with chili pepper flakes but keep meaning to get some at the store!  I like that others are throwing other vegetables in along with the zucchini.  I haven't tried that but once didn't have zucchini and it was good with just onions and peppers.  I've started buying frozen and canned just to keep everything on hand to make this.  It's a handy one for a last minute dinner.  My husband, who normally won't eat turkey except at Thanksgiving likes it and I convinced the kids to eat it with a little chips and cheese.  You don't really need the sour cream or cheese in the basic version.  It's good as a basic turkey chili, nice & healthy ...

I loved this recipe! It was the first time I made chili and it came out great! I added some diced adouille to it b/c I like heat, and used chicken broth rather then beef broth. I also left out the zucchini but added a can of drained cannolini beans...delicious!!

I added two cans of light kidney beans and used ground turkey breast.  I liked it a lot!  I wasn't expecting it to be as spicy as it is, but that was from my choice of salsa and chili flakes.  However, I did like that it was a little different than traditional chilis and very healthy.  (I used less oil as well).  Thanks!

This was really delicious.  I too added a can of garbanzo beans, a can of black beans and a small can of corn.  I used red pepper instead of green.  A dash of brown sugar too.  It was just the right consistency.  Very hearty and healthy and no way can you tell that it is made with turkey!  The melted cheese on top was great!!

I've made this recipe twice now, and it has turned out amazing both times.  I never thought using canned and packaged ingredients could taste so fresh!

I had better results using the all white meat ground turkey (as opposed to the regular ground turkey with dark meat).  I used olive oil instead of veg. oil.  I also used two pounds of meat both times and omitted the onion and green bell pepper (personal preference).  I added two tablespoons of chili powder, a few dashes of cayenne pepper and extra of all the other spices.  At the end, if it's not thick enough, you can always stir in a tablespoon of flour or cornstarch mixed with cold water.

I also ran the chiles through the food processor for a less chunky texture and used a sweet salsa, I like a little sweet/spicy combo in my chili.  I added a can of corn to make up for the missing body (less chunks and no beans for me!).

Everyone loves this chili and I can't get enough - especially topped with low fat cheese and FF sour cream!

Awesome recipe, I also added 2 cans of black beans (drained and rinsed) and next time I will cut up my zucchini into smaller peices. I could not and still can not find the jar of cut green chilli peppers, so I just added a bit more chilli powder and cut up jalopenos to serve on the side.   It was delicious.  Great chilli.

My husband and I REALLY enjoy this chili.  I am always trying to find yummy recipes that substitute for beef (since I don't eat it and he does!).  This one does the trick.  I make it as written but I add one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans!  A++++

Great recipe! Not too hard or even too expensive to make. I added my own twist here and there. Used olive oil and butter to cook the veggies with a clove a garlic. Added some kidney beans and corn. Made a hearty meal the entire family loved, thanks for posting it.

This chili was so delicious. The only changes I made to the ingredients were adding an additional half pound of turkey (so 2 lbs total) and adding a can of IPA. 

Out of laziness I made this a one pot meal and it turned out perfectly. I sauteed the onion first, then the turkey then I added the zucchinni and garlic and spices. I used a full can of IPA that I had on hand to deglaze the pan before adding the other liquids. After that I followed the recipe instructions exactly but simmered for a long time. I wanted the zuchinni to get really soft so i could smash it and thicken the chili. 

Worked like a charm and will definitely be making this again!

Wow flavor and you’d never know it was turkey except for the color.  I had only a lb. of ground turkey so I adjusted the amount of other ingredients accordingly and added garlic and  rinsed black beans.  I also used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned and only 1/3 of pepper flakes.   Also did not have beef broth so I used Italian beef gravy.  Delicious!  I thought zucchini in chili would have been odd but it was great.

Outstanding chili recipe! I didn’t have zucchini so I subbed chopped celery and I also added a can of pinto beans. This immediately replaced my previous favorite chili recipe!

This is my go to chili recipe.    Delicious every time.  Very customizable and simple.  The zucchini really works well.  I have made this many times with and without adding beans. Without beans, it is keto-friendly, a plus for my keto-conscious husband.

Delicious and easy. Since ground turkey comes in 1 lb packages in our store I just used that and kept everything else the same (no red pepper flakes because we are wimps). Perfect and just the right spice.

I keep the ingredients for this recipe in my pantry at all times and make this every week to 10 days to eat as a meal or snack.  Excellent if you are watching your weight.  I follow the recipe exactly using white breast ground turkey.  Today I decided to add a small can of low sodium corn and a can of chili beans in mild sauce  just for a slight change. Sometimes I use toppings, sometimes I don't.

Delicious recipe! The only change was to add one can each of black beans, red beans and white beans. I did not use taco seasoning but used no salt chili seasoning instead. Will definitely make again!

I was so excited to make this because of all the rave reviews. I made it as instructed but added corn and black beans as recommended by others. I found the taste to be blah, just okay. I had to spice it up a bit on my own adding more salt, ground cumin and a few other additions. I think that there is too much broth in the recipe and it was very loose. It took a really long time for me to cook it down to reduce the liquid. Also, I think that the crushed tomatoes also gave too much liquid. I would use 2 cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes if I were to make this again and skip the salsa. I'm glad others liked this recipe but it just didn't cut the mustard for us.

I am not a big fan of recipes that use packaged food products or seasoning mixes. This one asks you to chop fresh onions and peppers, but then wants you to dump in a jar of salsa?? Coriander powder, Chili pepper flakes and oregano then a pack of taco seasoning??    Redundant...   Oh, and chili without beans? come on.. A bag of red kidney beans re-hydrated and cooked while the veggies are cut, prepped and cooked.
Due to the above, I really only use this recipe as a general guide for the turkey/squash ratio.  I make a home made chili seasoning mix from multiple varieties of dried chilies, Mexican oregano and roasted cumin seed then measure it in, according to the meat volume. 
I have made this at least 4 times now, tripling the recipe each time because it is _that_good_  and freezes well.
Everyone who tries it loves it. The squash is a master stroke that keeps the turkey from getting dry and gritty.

Mix and match on some ingredients and I'm a huge fan of cilantro and actual "live" chilis rather than powder, but the turkey adds a lighter dimension that's really delicious.

Like others I added beans and frozen yellow corn.  One thing I also like is some smoky flavor, so I added a good smoky hot sauce (devil's duel).  2-3 tsp adds a great southwest smoky spice flavor without overdoing the heat.

I have never made turkey chili before, but this stuff was very good! I did it a little different, as I cooked it in my Instant Pot. I sautéed the turkey with the spices &  tomato paste, added the beef stock, salsa, and then threw everything else in and set the Instant Pot on the "chili" program (high-pressure for 30 minutes). I am not a zucchini super-fan so I didn't know how that would turn out, however even with 3 zucchini, which seemed like a LOT, it really cooked down to a lot less, and you wouldn't even know that there was zucchini in there. Like other reviewers, I added a blended-up can of black beans for extra protein & fibre. I could not find pinto beans in the store (they're not common in central Canada), so I added a can of refried beans which are pinto beans ground up anyway. Worked like a charm. Will definitely make this again!

I was skeptical because I don't really like zucchini and there are no beans, but was asked to make this for a large crowd. The only change I made was I replaced the green chilis for a can of Tomatoes and chilis so it wouldn't be quite as hot. It was very good!

Delicious. I added about six cloves of garlic sliced plus some garlic powder and used chicken stock instead of beef. (Just personal preference.) Sauteed the onions, pepper, garlic and three smallish zucchini in the pan after the turkey. Put all into the slow cooker on low, it's been on about two hours now and the seasoning and flavor is perfect. Not a zucchini fan and was afraid it's overpower the dish with its zucchini-ness but it didn't and the dish is very tasty. Will be serving with Mexican cream, cheese and scallion, as directed.

Awesome chili recipe. One of our favorites. I reduced the coriander to1/2 tsp, oregano 1/2  tsp, chili pepper flakes 1/4 tsp because I wanted a bit milder flavor & it was delicious.

I found this recipe several years ago when searching for a healthier alternative to ground beef chili and have made it many times for family and friends. It’s always a huge hit and I’ve passed the recipe on more times than I can count. It has a rich, delicious flavor and you can omit or alter the veggies to your liking, such as adding a can or two of kidney beans. Try subbing half of the ground turkey with turkey sausage removed from the casings for more texture. Even better the next day!

Except for the sour cream, cheese and some additional spices, this is essentially the Weight Watchers' chili. Very good.

This was a wonderful chili recipe. I usually do not change anything when I first try a recipe but I have to admit I added 1 14oz can of red kidney beans as one reviewer suggested and it was perfect for us. My husband is used to seeing beans in his chili so I didn't want to disappoint and it was great. This recipe is VERY flavourful. You don't need to add any flavour after adding the listed ingredients. Thank you for a new go-to recipe. Much appreciated!

Made exactly as written, and LOVED it! Made it a dozen times or more now, several times for company, and have had to give this recipe out to several people. A keeper for sure!

I have probably made this a dozen times or more.  I change it up a little every time--add more veggies, spices, etc. but it is great every time.   One thing I always do is add 2 cans of chickpeas as several reviews suggest.  That really makes it perfect.  I am making this today and doubling the recipe so there are plenty of leftovers.  Don't hesitate to try it...it's a winner

Great recipe! We try to eat Heart Healthy so I wanted a chili without beef & this was very tasty.  I left out the coriander since I forgot to get it.  I substituted red pepper for bell pepper, and only used 1 zucchini because I was afraid my husband would balk at too much. :)  At the end I added a can of  chili beans and a can of corn.  We loved it!!  I froze half of it since it makes a lot and it's just 2 of us.

This is now my favourite chili recipe but I only gave it 4 stars as I made a few changes in line with the suggestions of others. I added a half a pound of ground turkey as it's only sold by the pound where I live. I also added a can of black beans, a clove of garlic and a cup of frozen corn. I sauteed the onions, garlic and green beans for a few minutes first. Then, I added the turkey and continued cooking until it was browned. Then I threw all of the ingredients into a crockpot and cooked on high for 4 hours.

I didn't use the zucchini because they were past their prime upon further inspection.  Instead I added a can of rinsed dark kidney beans and a can of sliced mushrooms.  I also used chicken bone broth and added cumin.  Cooked it long enough to reduce out most of the liquid and then put in a 9x13 pan.  I mixed a box of jiffy corn mix with 1/2 cup sour cream, 3 eggs, 1/2 shredded cheddar cheese, and 3 green onions chopped and spread it on top of the chili.  Baked for 30 minutes at 350 or until corbread was golden brown.  So yummy!  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make again.

This was delicious and most definitely terrific!  It was very easy to throw together and had a phenomenal flavor.  This is definitely up there with our top favorite chili recipes.  I did only use 1 lb. ground turkey, added in some chopped celery, a few chopped garlic cloves, and about 1/2 can of water added.  I also completely omitted step 3.  I found it unnecessary to saute the veggies separately and just sauteed them up with the meat mixture from the beginning.   I did add the zucchini near the last 20-30 minutes, so they wouldn't get too mushy, and only added 1 medium sized zucchini and it was plenty.   I simmered on the stove for around 1 1/2 hours and it was so full of flavor and delicious.  You don't miss the beans in this.  It's a great turkey veggie chili with a medium heat level.  Thank you for the recipe, it will definitely be made again!

I sautéed the onion with a bit of garlic for a few minutes & just added the turkey and spices to the same pan to add more flavour to the meat. Per other reviewer suggestions, I added a beer while simmering. First batch I made without the zucchini, but added chickpeas, black beans & corn. Added a tablespoon of sugar to cut the tomato acidity.  I took it to work in my crockpot for a lunch event. It simmered all morning & was a big hit. Will definitely use this as my go to chilli.

Mmmm.  This is a great recipe.  Just a few changes- low sodium taco seasoning, 2 cans beans (we used kidney and pinto), and added chipotle hot sauce to taste.

Easy process and ingredients I usually have on hand. My husband said the spices were good and didn't even notice it was turkey until I told him. Only change I made was to use "Chili-ready" tomatoes, instead of tomatoes and added chili's. Also, I added carrots and celery for more veggies. You can never have too many veggies!

This was VERY EASY to make, healthy, not much prep work or ckean up, and most of all delicious! Instead of zucchini, I added a can of great north white beans. I also added a little additional chili powder and about a teaspoon of garlic powder. I typically don’t like ground turkey much but I will most certainly make this again. My hubby is a heart patient and everything in this (minus the sour cream and cheese) are good for his diet.  It is a meal the whole family enjoyed!

Really tasty! Mine didn't come out too thin at all- it was deliciously thick and hearty. The turkey adds a nice lighter taste than a beef chili would have. And I added about 1.5 ounces of extra chiles because I couldn't find a 7oz. can in the store, so it was nice and spicy!

Turkey seems like a healthier option but it still tastes like turkey.  I think I'll stick with low fat hamburger instead.

I added frozen corn, doubled the amount of diced tomatoes and added a can of black beans to the chili.  I used spicy salsa and it delivered a nice heat.  This is now my husband's favorite chili/soup.

Great turkey chili recipe! I stuck to the proportions in the recipe exactly, didn't need to add beans as some other cooks reported. The zucchini was enough to add weight. If you like controlling your ingredients a bit more, there is a good taco spice recipe in the app. Fresh poblano peppers work nicely instead of canned, extra crushed tomato and garlic etc instead of salsa. Enjoy!

Not a zucchini fan in chili, so I omitted it.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes and added kidney beans.  I cooked the turkey, onions and green peppers together and put them and the rest of the ingredients in a crock pot on low for the day.  My husband who is not a fan of ground turkey loved this.  Nice!  Easy recipe on top of it!

good chili- even better than store bought!

didn't have taco seasoning, so used chili season packet (+ sugar) instead.  browned meat then dumped everything into slower cooker on high, 4 hrs with lid ajar.
only used 2 (diced) zucchinis and added some drained canned beans and frozen corn at the end (omitted the tomato paste).

This is a terrific base recipe. I combined other favorite chili recipe ingredients by  adding  2 cans chili beans, 1 can light kidney beans (drained), 2 tbs. cocoa, 1/2 cup beer, 1 tbs. Lea and Perrins,  2 bay leaves.   It was fabulous.  One of my friends reported that is was the best chili he had ever had.   Even better reheated!

I'm a bit of a lazy cook and this recipe had more ingredients and steps then I'd do on a weeknight, but for a Sunday afternoon I gave it a try. It was well worth the extra prep time. Delicious and even better the second day. The only thing I did differently was make a pot of penne pasta to serve the chili over -- yum!

This is a great recipe for turkey  chili.  I also chose reduced sodium taco seasoning, water instead of beer, and added a pinch of salt for more flavor.  As always, prepare your vegetables ahead of starting so that the process goes quicker.  This is a more more hearty, liquid chili so adjust according to your liking as the recipe suggested.

I love that this recipe didn't call for a ton of salt and it was pretty easy to find low-sodium versions of the seasonings and canned items.  Like many other reviews, I loaded mine with veggies (corn, black beans, carrots, jalapeno, mushroom) though it was still thick with plenty of meat, not soupy as some others experienced.  I did a double batch so that I can freeze some for later.  Served it with cheddar-scallion cornbread.

I've been making ground turkey chili for years in a crockpot,  I get a bit carried away,  I use one pound of ground turkey, black beans, pintos, red kidney and red beans. Along with my seasonings I add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter, this tweaks the flavor and if you over season the chili,  the peanut butter buffers the heat. I'd list the seasonings but I never make my chili the same way twice (I must be dyslexic or have a short attention span), I use a pinch of this, a fistful of that, a smidgen of whatever, a can of beer I just walk it through the spice garden !  Plus I git  1/2 crocked makin' crockpot chili !!! Bon Appetito,...Shalom !

Amazing recipe, but in our family’s opinion, even better with the addition of two cans of beans! My two small children love this turkey chili, especially when coupled with cornbread. Yum.

This wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't anything great either.  The taco seasoning was interesting, but I'm not entirely sure I'd want to use it again.  The zucchini was new to me also.  It was nice to get a few more veggies in and I didn't mind them, but with these two additions it took on a new flavor rather than your traditional chili/turkey chili.  I needed to add a black and kidney beans and a lot more water.  For those with kids who don't care for spicy, you may want to lose the green chilies.

I used the dark meat leftovers from a whole Turkey we cooked. I great way to use the dark meat in cold weather. I also found it very strange that the recipe called for 1.5 pounds of ground turkey when ground turkey is sold in one pound packages.

My friend asked if I'd make this with her and we did. 

it was ok but to be honest the beef broth did not go with the turkey meet.  I think water or chicken broth would be better. 

Also the zucchini was way out of place and didn't go with the chili.  I would not use a packet of taco mix; it's kind of gross.  I'd rather use chili powder, paprika, & cumin.  It was also a little bit thin for me.  I would use kidney beans or a bean of your choice.  

Ive made and eaten a lot of chili and it just wasnt that great.  I'm sure some will enjoy it but we want more authentic taste that we got.  I didn't like the green onions either.  Raw onions would have been better.  IMHO.

This chili wasn't very good.  It just didn't have very much flavor.  I've since doctored the leftovers with 4 tablespoons of chili powder, 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, and a healthy dash of tabasco sauce.  It is better with the additions.  I also now know that I prefer my chili without chunks of zucchini.  I made the recipe exactly as written, except I couldn't find the 14.5 oz. of crushed tomatoes, and hadn't yet seen the recommendation for the substitute, and so used 14.5 oz. of petite diced tomatoes in juice.

Added black beans, pinto beans and corn. And took someone's suggestion of adding a little garlic. Also, 1 tsp of red pepper flakes is just enough heat to be yummy, but not too much for the kids.

I skipped the jar of salsa, used 2 lbs of lean ground turkey and browned that with onions, carrots and celery. I skipped the zucchini and green pepper too and added maybe an 1/8 cup of brown sugar. Then added two cans of rinsed pinto beans at the end. It's really good!  Very easy. Great fall meal!

This was fantastic! Hardly changed a thing, added chili beans and black beans and extra tomatoes. Tsp of chili powder because I was out of chili flakes. The flavor on this is wonderful. Husband said it is his favorite chili yet. Thank you for the great recipe! Side note- you can easily just brown the turkey, then add your diced onion, green pepper, and zucchini with spices and sautee til tender to your liking...no need to do that step seperately at the end in another pan for any cooks that are unsure.

i did this in the slow cooker, browned the meat first and then threw it all int he slow cooker for 2.5 hours on high and 1 hour on low. I had to use cumin instead of coriander since I didn't have any in the pantry, but it still tasted great!  If using the slow cooker, i recommend to chop the veggies bigger than usual because they turn mushy, but we like it that way. I also had to use onion powder to supplement b/c i didn't have enough onions. I thought it was too soupy, so i added extra tomato paste to thicken it up.  I also added half can of kidney beans - duh! Chili!

This was gobbled up so next time I will double the recipe. Made some minor changes: used chili powder instead of flakes, 2 zucchini, 2 cans petite diced tomatoes since I didn't have crushed, and added 1 can of beans and some frozen corn.  We also like yellow or red peppers verses green.  Too many steps with cooking veggies so next time will combine some of them like onion, peppers, and zucchini into one step or add the onion and pepper with the meat to cook.

This was super yummy and easy to make. The only thing I would do different is not add so much heat! I added "Hot Taco Seasoning" and half my chili's were hot. Adding sour cream to it helped but it was still a bit too spicy for my family. O and I also added a can of rinsed chili beans - because it seemed odd to have chili without the beans.

Delicious. As other reviewers suggested, I also added black beans and pinto beans, a sprinkling of frozen corn at the end. Also added some leftover roasted butternut squash - awesome. More chili pepper flakes, we like spicy. After browning, sauteing, put in slow cooker for 8 hours on low. Will definitely make again. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

So good!  I'd been avoiding Turkey Chili for a while because it just didn't sound that good to me.  Wrong!!!  This recipe was easy and delicious.  I skipped the zucchini, coriander and green chilis because I didn't have any, and added 1/4 c. brown sugar (it made it pretty sweet but in a good way) and 1 can each of beans:  light red kidney, dark red kidney and white beans.  A keeper!

Came in second out of 18 for a chilli cook off. Missed first by one point. Great recipe but I added peppers and didn't mash the beans this time. I wanted people to see the beans.  Also added more cumin and chili powder to taste.  Was bland without extra seasoning.

Fantastic, highly recommend.
did not add coriander.
I did add 1 large drained can of kidney beans, and 1 large  drained can of mixed beans. 
other wise followed exactly. 
Best turkey I've ever tasted, thank you for sharing.
I make it the day before and you can't tell it's not  beef.
I have made it at least once a month since I found recipe.
Left overs freeze well.

Outstanding, but with a few tweaks. I substituted ground chuck instead of the turkey, Carol Shelby's Chili Mix instead of the taco seasoning, left out the zucchini and added fresh jalapeños, half a beer, and 2 cans of kidney beans. I'll make this again!

I am completely inadequate in the kitchen and this entirely manageable for me. It is delicious! The only thing I did differently was to add a bit more tomato paste as I prefer my chili more "red", if you will. I also cut back on the salsa, as the first time, I used what was suggested and it was a bit watery. I divide this into portions and freeze so I can take it to work for lunch. It thaws and serves up really nicely after freezing. Bravo!

This recipe is excellent! I have made it several times and each time it's been delicious! I did a few variations the last few times. I left out the coriander( I didn't have any) and I used red pepper flakes, I also added a can of light red kidney beans. One thing I did the first time was I sautéed the onion and green pepper with the turkey and just added the zucchini once everything was mixed together and it cooked while the chili was simmering. This recipe is so great that even though I have had to change a few things because I didn't have one of the ingredients it has came out excellent every time!

This is easy to make and tastes great. I made it more or less following the recipe, but I used chicken "Better Than Boullion" and used more of it.  I personally think the zucchini is a great substitute for beans. Not everyone likes beans in chili. The beauty of this recipe is you can kinda throw in what you have on hand and it still turns out great.

Next time I make this I'll add more zucchini and use a bigger pot, because this will get eaten up fast!!!! XD

I didn't have coriander!  I used cumin.  I didn't have enough beef broth! I added chicken broth.  We don't like too much hot/heat so skipped the green chiles. I only had a red pepper, not green.  I know that's a lot of changes!  but other than that - the spice balance was fantastic!  the consistency was fantastic!  the kid asked for MORE! in fact - said - will you make this all the time? Why yes, yes I will. :)

I used hot taco seasoning mix and added two cans of red kidney beans and two cloves of garlic. It turned out spicy, but that's how we like it. Delicious! I'll definitely make this again!

I really liked this chili. I never would have thought to add zucchini to chili. I changed a few things. I didnt add the hot pepper flakes by choice, I couldnt locate my coriander spice, and accidentally forgot to add the chilis. This was a meaty chili and mild the way I made it. I only had a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes so I used the whole can. I used a fresh Texas salsa for the amount called for. To save time I sauteed the onion, green pepper, and 2 med. zucchini in a little oil, removed it, and then sauteed the turkey. I used 1 1/4 lb pack Shady Brook 93% lean ground turkey and seasoned it with Adobo seasoning. Lastly, the submitter suggested gabanzo beans added were good. I added a can of drained rinsed pinto beans at the end of simmering time. I used the garnishes listed and they worked well with this. Ty

Wonderful.  I think it would have been amazing just as written but I read some other reviews and tweaked it. I diced up about 2 lb of leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  Sautéed the onion and peppers with a few garlic cloves.  Added one can of pinto beans , can of corn and 1 tablespoon of chili powder.  Threw everything in crock pot for 6 hours on low. Super tasty.

Excellent! I added black and white northern beans; the consistency is great. I made it to eat for lunch tomorrow, but sampled small bowl w/o any cheese, green onions or sour cream and ended up yummin' down another bowl w/o missing any of it! Can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

My first recipe and review on Allrecipes.com!  This chili was completely delicious!  I followed the recipe and made some additions based on the recommendations of other reviewers, such as one can each of black beans, and kidney beans (both drained), and increased the crushed tomato to a 28 oz can.  I also added two items from my kitchen that needed to be used up:  one tomato, chopped up, and roughly 1/3 cup of frozen corn kernels.  The amount of spices was perfect and did not need salt (I did not use low sodium broth, but did use low sodium crushed tomato, if that helps).  I did use about a half can (7 oz or so) of leftover chicken broth instead of water since the addition of the beans really thickened up the chili.  I love this recipe and hope my further creations are just as successful!

I give this recipe 5 stars with the addition of garbanzo beans and black beans. The whole batch went the night I made it, even my girlfriend who "doesn't like chili" loved it. Cornbread compliments this dish perfectly. The only thing I would do differently next time is make a double batch!

Terrific is right! I make A LOT of chili once the weather starts cooling down, and frequently try new recipes, always searching for the perfect one.  This was definitely one of the best, if not the best, turkey chili I've made.  Not sure, but I'm guessing it had to do with the green chiles.  This recipe quick and easy, and unlike most chili/soups, it tasted excellent right away (versus tasting much better the 2nd day). I'll admit, I thought the method was a bit odd since most chili and soup recipes begin with sautéing the onions and peppers (and garlic, which this recipe doesn't use);  browning the meat, then combining the two  before you start adding everything else to the meat mix.  I stuck with the method in this recipe and it was fine. I did tweak this recipe to suit my own taste and am confident the changes didn't alter the original enough to affect, what I believe to be a 5 star recipe as written. Here are my tweaks: Added a can of red kidney and a can of black beans, both drained. Used 3 Tbsp of Bob Echol's taco seasoning mix (sans the red pepper flakes) instead of a box mix. Did not add additional oregano since my mix had it already, nor did I add red pepper flakes. No zucchini - can't imagine it in chili. Diced tomatoes instead of crushed. The finished product was delicious. It was a bit thick, but that's fixable. It was fine for eating right away, but will be super thick when re-heating. 3 people ate this and we only had 2 small servings left.

My husband LOVES chili, but I'm generally not a fan. I decided to try this recipe to make a special meal for him, and it was delicious! He said it was the best chili he ever had! (I tried a different recipe on here another time, and he did not think it was great.) I subbed a couple of items: I added 2 extra tablespoons of the tomato paste and I added black beans. This gave it a nice tomato taste and the black beans were a great change from kidney beans. I also let the chili cook on low for 4 hours. I served it with cornbread. Yum!

I was skeptical at first. Taco seasoning in my chili?  But my husband and I were very happy with the results. We added 2 cans of red kidney beans to give it a little more flavor and added nutrition.  Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe except I use low-sodium taco seasoning. That is probably why I had to add some salt to taste and I also added some Worcester sauce. I also saw some comments and added about a 4th cup of brown sugar. I highly recommend adding a little sugar the little bit of sweetness made this chili to die for, it was delicious. My husband and I both loved it.  I noticed a lot of people added beans but as a "no bean" chili this is a terrific recipe.

I made two versions, and halved the ingredients for each pot. In one pot, I used ground turkey, in the other beans (black and red). We have a mixed house (vegetarian and omnivore), so making the whole recipe either way would have resulted in too many leftovers. I used the spices exactly in the vegetarian version and added one jalapeno (perfect!), left out the hot spices and peppers for the turkey version (husband and kids strongly approved). I can't wait until tomorrow to eat it again, chili tastes better after sitting overnight. I think I will serve it with Southern corn bread tomorrow.

I've never followed a chili recipe before but I decided to try this. I used chicken stock (all I had) and whole tomatoes I crushed up by hand after draining the juice (i kept the juice aside but never ended up needing it because I don't like watery chili) and jarred jalapenos instead of chili peppers. Everyone said it tasted like it was cooking in the crockpot all day. Literally the best they've ever had. Will definitely always keep this on hand.

This is a wonderful chili recipe!  My whole family loved it-including my super picky 8 year old boys (they cleaned their bowls), and my toddler loved it.  I did add a can of black beans and corn (rinsed) and added a few cloves freshly minced garlic to the green pepper and onion mixture.  It was delicious.  We will definitely make this again!!

I used the crockpot after browning the turkey.  Used less beef broth and no chili peppers, added beans as suggested and my son didn't know it was made from turkey.   Having the cool sour cream on top really brought out the flavor.

This is wonderfully delicious!! I love the levels of flavor!! I make turkey chili often but none have ever tasted this good!! A KEEPER!! The onions add a wonderful crunch and do try with fritos. (-: I did add a tablespoon of chili powder and beans and both were a bonus. Enjoy!!

This is one of my favorite chili recipes.  It is not a traditional chili, so if that's what you want, this ain't your recipe.  I LOVE the zucchini, and the overall flavor of this dish is out of this world.  However, my husband and daughter are not fond of it, so I make it when they're not home.  I usually add a can of beans, but to me, it is a 5 star recipe even without them.  It is a very adaptable recipe.  Try it!

Very good! I made only a few slight changes to the recipe (left out the salsa and added kidney beans) and this was some of the best chili I've had anywhere! A great healthy meal

I am not a chili fan, but was in charge of my team's submission for a Chili Cook off at work. Made this recipe for our practice run. Changed a few things, but it was a big hit for us. I eliminated the bell peppers, zucchini and green onions. (I don't do those). Used chicken broth vs. beef broth and added a drained can of black beans. I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil and sauteed the onions with a chopped garlic clove first, placed those aside, then browned the meat in the same skillet.  After the turkey was browned well with all spices, I added the prior onion/garlic, then added the rest of the ingredients. Put the mixture in the crock pot on high for 2.5-3 hrs. To add a little something after it cooked for an hour, I put about a teaspoon of soy sauce which seemed to blend all the flavors. Served with cheddar sprinkled on top, a spoon of sour cream and oyster crackers. It was the best and my family raved over it! Was a hit at the Chili Cook Off too.

I loved how easy it follow this was. I did, however, add ground beef and pork. I also added black beans to make it a little more hearty.

My husband and I love this chili.  The only thing I added was a couple of cans of beans.  Otherwise, the recipe is great as-is.

I made this for a Super Bowl party and it was absolutely delicious.  I did take suggestions from others and added a can each of kidney beans and black beans.  I had a bottle of Goya Spicy Chipotle sauce - added a few good shakes - just enough to add some flavor without that overwhelming smokiness you sometimes get from Chipotle. Never thought of putting zucchini into chili, but it was incredible.

We decided to make this as a family (myself, my husband and our 11 year old son).  It was amazing!  We loved it and will definitely be making this again!  We decided to quarter the zucchini instead of cutting them in half.  It worked out much better for us.

This was a great recipe and my family LOVED it.  I too removed the zucchini but added beans and it was great.  I will probably add more tomatoes next time but overall it was fantastic!!!

Absolutely delicious. I didn't have zucchini, but eggplant was a good substitute. To make it a little heartier, I added drained black beans (Goya black bean soup made with olive oil, onion an bell pepper). I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is a regular meal in our house! My husband hates kidney beans and I love chili so when I was searching for a recipe I stumbled upon this and had to try it. It's become OUR chili recipe and he asks for it all the time! I don't put in cheese, green onion, sour cream or zucchini, but the thing with chili is you can pretty much do whatever you want. It also has the perfect amount of heat in it too!

I love this chili.  It's become my go-to chili recently.  I don't even think it needs any added beans.  It's great as it is.  I do add extra tomato paste and tomatoes, but that's all the changes I make.

Amazing flavor. I'm on a low carb diet and dishes like this are the ones that make me feel I'm not missing on anything. Delicious.  Little too spicy so will cut chiles amount in half next time. Loved it!

I use recipes on line frequently, and never have I taken the time to review them. This recipe is definitely the exception to the rule, it's fantastic.  Fun to cook and great flavor.  I added a can of drained kidney beans and used chicken broth rather than beef and increased the amount of tomato paste to thicken and the family couldn't get enough.  Thank you and Bon Appetite!

Wow-- Great recipe.  One of my favorite chills ever, and I make a lot.  Only changes I made-- per other reviews, added a can of black beans, can of garbanzo beans and about a tablespoon of chili powder.  And I subbed yellow pepper for the green (hubby's preference).  Going into my regular chili rotation!

When I saved this to my recipe box I didn't notice the multiple steps to sauté the vegetables. I decided to just throw all the veggies in with the turkey as it browned. It cut back on the oil saved me a few steps (and dishes). We enjoyed the flavor of the chili topped with sour cream and sharp cheddar. We will make this again.

We loved it! You would never know it was turkey! I added two cloves of garlic to the turkey mixture and another clove to the onion mixture. We didn't have zucchini and didn't want green pepper so I omitted both of those. I added some cilantro in place of the coriander seed and added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce , a little red wine and a can of pinto beans to the simmering chili mixture. I also doubled the recipe. My husband loves chili and said this was by far the best he ever had, which shocked me, I mean it is turkey chili after all! Totally delicious! You must make it!

I'm not able to eat beans so this is the prefect recipe for me and also the first time I have cooked with ground turkey. In a slow cooker on auto shift I put the beef broth in and started to heat it up.  Cooked the ground turkey with the spices suggested in 1 TBSP of oil.  Set aside. With the other 1 TBSP oil sauteed the onions, 2 TBSP garlic, green bell pepper, and green chilies (med).  Added black bean and corn med salsa.  Heated a bit.  Added turkey mixture and salsa mixture to slow cooker.  Added 1-14 oz. can of whole kernel corn, drained and added diced chili tomatoes with 1/2 liquid.  Added 1 tsp chili powder and a dash of salt.  Cooked for 5 hours.  The family loved it and want me to serve it again.  Great way to use ground turkey. debmo

Yum!!!  Used  my own produce so green beans in place of zucchini, no cans, Ramen packet for beef broth!  Great spice combo.  Will make with veggie "crumbles' for vegetarians and seasonal/ put-up produce whenever made but the spice combo is PERFECT.  :)

This was really good.  We don't care for zuchini, so we substituted a can of kidney and a can of pinto beans.  I used my own taco seasoning (from this website) and use anch chili powder (next time I will use regular chili powder).  We squeezed 1/4 of a juicy lime in each bowl and topped with fresh cilantro (we did not add the corriander), sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  The lime and other toppings really made the dish.  It may have been a bit light on flavor otherwise.  Also it was good the first day; but, it was way better the second day.  If you are making this to take somewhere or for company make it the day before.  It is worth the wait.

I made this recipe a few years ago, following it exactly. Since then, I've been tweaking it, but I still come back to this for reference. I don't add the taco seasoning, salsa or can of chili peppers - The salsa simply isn't needed and I replaced the canned chili peppers with a couple chopped hot peppers. I replace the taco seasoning with random individual spices - chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, etc... you get the idea.  

Still, LOVE the zucchini in this.

My husband loves this!  I made this chili with a few changes and it was a huge hit with my very picky husband.  I did not add the bell pepper or zucchini.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, 1 can of light red kidney beans, and an extra teaspoon of chili pepper flakes.  Nice and spicy!

Fabulous recipe.  Like others, I replaced the zucchini with beans (1 can each of black, light kidney, and cannellini) and instead of turkey meat I went with the Boca crumbles (soy protein that's almost indistinguishable form ground turkey after it's cooked.).  The texture was just right, the flavors were rich but mild enough that everyone could enjoy.

You would never know it was turkey and not beef.  I add a can of black beans and a can of corn.  If I'm making it for my wife, I reduce the red pepper flakes by half.  One of my favorites.

Flavor was good but next time I will add less broth because it was a little watery.  I also ended up adding the whole can of tomato paste to thicken it up a little.  My husband also said that we should have added beans.

I made this for a couple friends of mine, and they absolutely loved it. I added garlic, took out the taco seasoning and used chili powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper instead, and used chicken broth instead of beef broth. It turned out AMAZING! I will be using it from now on.

One of the best Chili's, I have tried so far - my Family was a little skeptical at first, because of the Turkey meat, but it is marked for repeats. I didn't change the recipe at all, but would sub some meat for black beans next time, to cut down a little on meat. Thanks for this recipe!

We made this recipe to eat while we were watching the football playoffs. It's a nice meal for a chilly day. I didn't have chili pepper flakes, so I substitued chili powder in its place, about half a teaspoon. Also added a shake of cumin powder. The only other change I made was to add a can of black beans, and I would definitely do that again, added a lot in terms of flavor and thickening this up. The only other thing I would change is to cut back on the zucchini; for us this was way too much zucchini, and it seems a little out of place in a chili recipe. I would probably leave it out of the recipe entirely next time we make it. We topped ours with crushed tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and sour cream, and it was great.

Easy and delicious!  As with some of the other reviewers, I cooked the veggies with the turkey.  I added a fresh jalapeno, garlic, chili powder, black and kidney beans.  I left out the squash as I'm not a fan.  Yum!

Great recipe! But I leave out the toppings, taste good without all the extras. Although, I do add a can of mixed beans (rinsed), and sometimes garbanzo beans too! And I'm kind of a garlic freak, so I add a bunch of that as well! :)

This is excellent turkey chili.  I used 2 zucchini instead of 3 and then added a small can of kidney beans and a small can of garbanzo beans. Gave a nice consistency and appearance. Also added 4 garlic cloves because I like Garlic.   It still tasted too much like taco seasoning. Added 1 cup of red wine and it became 5 star.

IT was great but because I was cooking it for my kids I made some changes. I did not use any chilly, instead of the tomato puree/paste, I used two fresh ripe tomatoes and mixed it with tomato paste to give them body. I used fresh coriander leaves and added some chicken masala (spice mix).
And for the turkey I used chunks instead of mince.

One of THE BEST chilis I have ever had! My family (including a 2yo and 6yo) loved it. I only had alb of turkey so I added a can of navy beans. I left out the chili pepper flakes (too hot for the kids). Served it with corn bread casserole on the side. WOW!!!!

I made this recipe last week and LOVED it so did my mother-in-law who is so picky! I made one change and that was to leave out the Beef Broth and replace it with Organic Vegetable Broth, was nervous thinking it may not be as good, but I do not eat red meat and all the Hydrogenated stuff they put in it and boulion cubes, yikes. But it was so excellent, I didn't have the chili pepper flakes, but I like to add to my soups and chili's, Franks Origanl RedHot sauce. I highly recommend this Chili it will be one of my favorites for chili and healthy if you use the right stuff, I recommend the Vegetable broth it tasted great and I am picky too, yum yum. I watched the video as I made it, that they have to the right of the recipe, it made it even easier and fun to make. Oh I did add Garbanzo beans as they suggested I also doubled this recipe, they definitely add to it. GREAT RECIPE!!!!

This is a great recipe! Perfect for a cold evening! I made a couple of small tweaks, based on how my husband and I like our food. First, I used only a 4 oz. can of the green chiles. But I added a clove of minced garlic and half of a jalepeno, chopped. Delicious! I will definitely make this again.

Best chili I have ever had! I made it the first time with Italian Turkey Sausage because it's what I had. The second time I made it with plain ground turkey. It was amazing both ways but the first with the Italian Sausage was better. I did add a TBS of minced garlic and some black beans. You made my family happy on these cold nights! Thank you for this recipe.

I made this in the crock pot yesterday, and it was FABULOUS!  Whenever I make a new recipe, I ask my family if there's anything I should change for next time, and both my daughter and my husband said it was perfect just the way it was!  I didn't change anything about it, other than cook it on low in the crock pot all day, and I added half a can of garbanzo beans and half a can of black beans.  I didn't have any coriander, so I had to leave that out.  It was very delicious and very tasty.  Oh, and instead of using a taco seasoning packet, I made the Taco Seasoning 2 recipe on this site.  Delicious.  Thank you!

Terrific Turkey Chili Haiku: "At a loss for words, at how Terrific this was. I'll make it again!" Absolutely adored this chili w/ the zucchini & AR's "Taco Seasoning I", along w/ the recipe submitter's suggestion of garbanzo beans. Seriously, I am in love w/ chick peas, and have never thought to use them in chili, so when I got home from work (I tossed everything but the zucchini in the crockpot in the a.m.) and smelled the heavenly aroma, I knew I was in for a treat. (Incidentally, I didn't saute the zucchini - just tossed the pieces into the crockpot about an 1 on low b4 serving, so they wouldn't be smoosh.)

Really yummy! and better the next day.  I did make changes to make this an even healthier recipe.  Instead of broth, I used water.  All my vegetable ingredients were fresh.  Hatch green chilies were in season so I used 1/2 c chopped.  Instead of the chili, I used chipoltle chili powder and to further reduce the sodium content, I made my own taco seasoning.  I also added 1 clove of chopped garlic to the sauteed veggies.  My husband loved it!

Really Delicious. I had a packet of chilli seasoning mix on hand so I used that instead of taco mix. I also used 12 ounces of turkey and added a can of drained black beans. I browned the ground turkey on the stove top and then dumped that and everything else in the crock pot and cooked on high for about 4 1/2 hours. The chilli mix was just a tad too spicy so next time I'll use the taco mix as called for in the recipe

Good!  I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe on this site instead of a package.  I didn't have all the ingredients for this on hand, so I used a fresh jalapeno instead of the canned chiles, I used some red and yellow bell pepper instead of green, and I left out the zucchini.  I used chunky chipotle salsa.  I added a little garlic, but other than that the amounts of spices were right on! (Usually I have to add more spices to make our household happy.)  Also, we like chili with beans, so I added one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans.  It probably doesn't compare to chili with beef and pork, but I'm giving it five stars because we ate all the leftovers, and that seldom happens.

Very very good.  Made exactly according to directions, except for adding a little hot sauce.  I did not add beans, but next time I will add garbanzos because I think they will add a great addition of flavor and texture.
