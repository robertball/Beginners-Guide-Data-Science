Short review:loved it.  
Long review:
I used
- a 6 oz can of tuna
- 1 tbl of fat free nayonaise (soy based product)
- 1 tbl of "hot dog relish" (mustard/relish mixed)
- 1 tbl orange juice
- a nut mix of soy nuts, peanuts, cashews and sesame seeds with garlic powder and other spices already on it.

The flavor of the salad was overall "brighter" and different from normal tuna salad, but not so different as to be odd.  I thought the taste and texture were both great.  The only thing I didn't like was that the nuts became somewhat soft after sitting in the tuna salad overnight.  However, it is possible that it has something to do with the type of nuts I used.  Sometime, I'll have to try it with pecans or walnuts and see how it turns out.

This was deliciously different! I have a friend that was asking for a tuna salad w/o mayo in it...I am going to pass this one on to her. For a little extra sweetness, I added some chopped mandrin oranges after I tasted the original salad. I liked it even better with the man. oranges! Thanks for the post!

I didn't have onion powder, so I added a tablespoon or so of minced sweet onion.  This is delicious!

I did not have sweet pickle relish, so instead minced one large celery stalk. Not a fan of garlic powder or onion powder so I did not include these elements. Very good taste, I just served it over whole grain bread. Thank you for sharing!

This was ok but I think it may be better with chicken instead of tuna. I think the tuna flavor was a bit over powering for the rest of the ingredients. I'll try it with chicken next time.

This is a very tasty twist to tuna! I didn't even have sour cream so I had to use mayo but even with mayo it was good. I never thought orange juice would add such a great flavor, and not to mention the pecans! Yummy!

My daughter loved it! She doesn't like mayo so it was a great recipe to try. I am making this again tomorrow, and will add mandarin orange slices as others suggested...

Giving this a 5 star rating...we really liked it! Used it over a bed of Romaine lettuce w/boiled egg quarters on the side. Yummy w/a bowl of steaming chicken noodle soup.

I'm not a fan of the sweet pickle relish, so I use dill pickles instead. A really great dish!

I didn't care for this. I think it would have been better without the mustard. All the flavors just seemed to be competing, not complimenting eachother. Sorry, but thanks for sharing! :)

My family does not care for Tuna, but I do.  This recipe was a winner at both ends. No "fishy" tuna taste. It almost tasted like chicken! Very refreshing!  A keeper!

The delicious taste of this salad makes it very versatile! I used dijon mustard, doubled the amounts in this recipe, and added it to wheat bread to make one-sided tuna melts in the oven (with slices of cheddar cheese).  My husband is on a diet and absolutely loved the way this tasted.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used a fresh orange to squeeze the juice and then cut up the orange content and added that.   I tripled the amts of everything. Did add a tbsp of miracle whip.  Very nice different twist on tuna.  Thanks for the recipe.

I added extra orange juice and I still couldn't taste the orange.  It was very dry so I doubled the sour cream and mustard.  I also added some green onion for color and texture.
