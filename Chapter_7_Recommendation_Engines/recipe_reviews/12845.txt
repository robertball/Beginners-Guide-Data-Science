Okay... this recipe was very good, but there were a few adjustments that I had to make.  I went ahead and followed the directions, but instead of using milk, I substituted it with heavy whipping cream.  I chopped the onions, instead of slicing them.  I also added a few tablespoons of tomato puree, I added some more worestshire sauce and some more chayenne pepper and VIOLA! The recipe was perfected.  Oh... I also let it cook on low heat for about 1 hour.  The trick to this recipe is to allow it to simmer.  Wilma, you had the right idea, but you just needed a little more special additions to your recipe to make it perfect.  Thank you for giving me the basics.  This has become one of my family's favorite!  Michi in Miami

I discovered that it's possible to purchase a 12oz bag of frozen Australian slipper lobster tails at Trader Joe's for $8.99 so that's what I used. This soup was excellent! The lobster tails were raw and had to be sauteed. I reduced the liquid from them and added it to the soup. I made the following modifications: doubled the flour and butter, used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup reduced fat milk instead of two cups milk, added about 3 tbsp tomato paste, and used the extra cayenne pepper, extra Worcestershire sauce plus black pepper, parsley and garlic powder suggested in earlier reviews, and I simmered the soup for about an hour and a half. The one change I would make next time: I thought that simmering the lobster overcooked it and made it a bit tough. Next time I would add the lobster just before serving. Even better than the little Italian restaurant in my neighborhood. Will definitely make this again (and again).

This was bar none the best and easiest recipe ever. I like others changed a few things, I used one cup of milk and one cup of half-and-half, instead of an onion I used one small shallot, two tabelspoons of tomatoe paste (just enough to make the soup a little pink), I added a touch of old bay seasoning, a spalsh of garlic powder. Other people suggested three tabelspoons of flour, mine was very thick with two. I did not use lobster I used shrimp that i put through the food processor just for a second. Voila! Such a great recipe.

This recipe was phenomenal with the little changes that everyone had put in previously:
4 tablesppons butter
4 tablespoons flour - makes it thicker
1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup half and half, 1 cup heavy cream - this makes the recipe creamier
1/4 tsp parsley
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 tablespoon worcestershire
1/2 tsp cayenne

this was yummy but if you don't like a bite leave out the cayenne because it gives it a lot of kick

I had to rate this recipe.  It was very good.  I added more salt and worcetshire sauce and added garlic too.  It needed thickening up so instead of adding cream like others have suggested I took half of the soup out and blended it and then addedt it back to the soup.  It made the soup thick and a nice pink colour, without having to add the extra fat from the cream.

Similar to other reviewers, I spiced the recipe up a bit.  Change the worcestershire to 2 tsp, same with the cayenne pepper.  Omitted the salt, added garlic powder and fresh parsley.  Letting it simmer for about an hour was important, lets the flavor of the spices come through.  I also used 3 tbsp tomato paste to add flavor and help thicken, as well as use 1 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup half & half and 1/2 cup milk.

Wonderful recipe!  I was looking for a CRAB bisque, but none were shown as 5*.  I made the following changes and now have my crab bisque. Used 1 lb. fresh imitation crab instead of the lobster and fat-free half and half instead of the milk.  This is a delicious bisque that is easy reasonably priced, and better for you than it tastes.  We will have this on a regular basis.

After the 1st time trying this, my family BEGS me to make over and over. Like others, I used 1c half and half, 1c milk (2%) and added about 3 tablespoons tomato paste. Because of a picky family, I removed the onion after simmering. WONDERFUL! Great with a fresh salad and fresh bread. Thanks for sharing!

Very good - made a few adjustments.
Used 1 cup skim milk, 1 cup whipping cream instead of 2 cups milk.
Added:
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper (makes it pretty tasty..
1/4 tsp. pepper
1/4 tsp. parsley
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1 Tbsp. Worcheshire sauce (additional)

To save time, I prepared the lobster meat the day ahead then threw it all together the next day.  The soup is so delicious and very meaty.  
Thanks for such a great recipe!!

I've now made this a handful of times and everyone loves it

I used one cup whipping cream, half cup half & half and half cup of milk instead of two cups of milk.  I added zatarains creole seasoning to taste (about a teaspoon)and parsley.  Also used 3 teaspoons of flour instead of two. I added cooked shrimp in with the lobster meat.  The result was out of this world.  The bisque was creamy, meaty and well seasoned.

I have made this bisque several times, now.  The changes I made were mostly from reviewer Michi's Oct. 2003 review.  The only other change I made was to add some sherry to taste.  You can not have a good lobster bisque without sherry.  I have also made this using the imitation seafood combos that are a lot cheaper and it was great.  Oh, and I use seafood stock or clam juice instead of chicken stock.  Sounds like a lot of changes, but really the base recipe is very good and the joy of cooking is to make it like you like it.  Thanks, Wilma.

Good start - Needed some jazzing up.  I cooked the onions longer (10 minutes), added 1 TBL minced garlic, 3 TBL tomato paste, increased the worchestershire to 1.5 TBL, used 1 cup milk and 1 cup half & half, doubled the cayenne and added more salt to taste (much too bland) - THEN this recipe knocked my socks off!

This bisque is AWESOME!!  I've always loved lobster bisque and now that my husband catches lobster a lot, I decided to try out some lobster recipes myself.   I used a lot of the advice that others gave and I'm so glad that I did.  I used 1 shallot rather than regular onion.  To replace the milk, I used 1 cup half and half, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup skim milk (the only milk I had in the house).  I increased the amount of Worcestershire sauce to 1 tablespoon and cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.  I also added 3 tablespoons of tomato puree and about 1/2 cup parsley near the end.  I didn't want to overcook the lobster so I let the sauce simmer for about 30 minutes, then added the nearly fully cooked lobster (which I sauteed with butter, shallots and garlic) to the sauce to simmer for another 30 minutes.  SO TASTY!  If you prefer a mild taste, reduce the cayenne pepper.  1/2 teaspoon gives a nice kick which I loved.

I took 2 cans of chicken broth and simmered my leftover lobster tail shells-4- to make a seafood broth. Then I did as others, doubled the butter, flour, 3 TBSP tomato paste, added 2 TBSP worcestershire sauce, 1/4 tsp celery salt, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 2 tsp Old Bay Seasonsing. Used 1 pint of half and half. Simmered for an hour. Added in my lobster tails at the end and then used my emmersion blender to make it smooth. Poured in about 1/4 cup of sherry to serve...YUM!UPDATE!! 2/24/2014: This time I steamed my lobster in a dark lager and a light lager. I will always cook it this way...it came out perfect!!! 8 minutes for 2 large lobster tails. I reduced the liquid with the leftover lobster shells until it made a rich broth, about 2 cups. I added a TBSP of Better than Bouillon to give it a richer flavor. I sautéed a large shallot in the leftover "lobster dipping butter", added an equal amount of flour and cooked that for about a minute, added the lobster broth, 2 TBSP Worcestershire sauce, 3 TBSP tomato paste, celery seed, nutmeg, white pepper, 2 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning and a pinch of nutmeg. After that thickened, I emulsified it and then simmered it before adding HALF of the NON FAT half and half. Simmered it and now I am waiting for it to meld so that I can finish it off with the rest of the cream, sprinkling it with cooked chopped lobster and some sherry. Drooling!

Very quick & easy, and of course delicious! I also used a few alterations:
I boiled fresh shrimp & lobster until almost done, then simmered the boiling liquid and used 1 cup of that instead of the the chicken broth.
instead of 2 cups milk: I used 1 cup milk, 1 cup heavy whipping cream.
 Added:
 1/4 tsp. white pepper
 1/4 tsp. garlic powder
 2 tablespoons good chardonnay

My family loved it! Thank you for the quick recipe! Will sure to be making this again!  But I took Michi in Miami's advise and added extra Worcestershire sauce and a little more Cayenne pepper, along with a little tomato sauce (didn't have tomato puree).

I minced my onions and added about 2 tbsp total of W sauce.  It was fantastic and a great base for any kind of bisque.

This is my first review. This recipe was so excellent that I absolutely HAD to register to write this! I'm sure the basic recipe is very good to begin with (thank you Wilma!), but I changed several things to my liking.    First off, I didn't have any lobster so I used Lobster Classic by Trans Ocean. It's imitation lobster meat made with surimi, a cooked fish protein. This particular brand uses Alaskan Pollock. To my surprise, the Lobster Classic tasted quite good as a replacement for the real thing. You get a nice sweetness and none of the fishy flavor that I noticed when eating it by itself. While the texture is a little off, the bisque is so flavorful that it blends right in.    As far as the bisque ingredients go, I substituted:   6 pearl onions, sliced (in place of the regular sliced onion);  3 tbsps butter (instead of 2, to make it creamier);  1 1/2 tbsps corn starch (instead of 3 tbsps flour; my girlfriend has Celiac disease, which is essentially an intolerance to wheat gluten.);  1/2 tsp of seasoned salt (instead of regular salt);  1 dash cayenne pepper (instead of a pinch).   I then added:  1/4 tsp black pepper;  1 turkish bay leaf;  1 dash garlic powder;  1 dash celery salt.   I also let it simmer for about 30 minutes, which helped it thicken up better.    My girlfriend doesn't really like fish or shellfish much---granted I didn't use real lobster---but she LOVED this bisque! I am very happy to have found this recipe. Thanks a million!

This is easy to make and tasty if you follow the suggestions of others to up the Worcestershire sauce and use some tomato paste to thicken.  Otherwise, it's far too thin and watery.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  It required items that you would normally have in your home.  One thing though, I added a little thyme, a pinch of parsley and basil, these items spiced it up a bit more.  Overall my husband, parents and friends loved it very much.

I have never made a bisque before so I was somewhat apprehensive about making this recipe. I was sure off base! This recipe was so fast and easy! I made mine with shrimp instead of lobster and I was so pleased with the outcome. I also added more flour(about double)than what the recipe called for because I wanted to pour this bisque over pasta.

My husband and two year old son are both VERY picky eaters and both of them LOVED it. I will definitely make this recipe again and again. Thanks Wilma!

I made the recipe "as is" and neither my husband nor I were impressed.  It did not have much flavor.  If you are going to make this, you're going to have to invest time in reading others' reviews and adding multiple ingredients to the original recipe.

I took a few modifications to this recipe and we all loved it!  We had langostino lobster from Costco, and when shopping for ingredients I found Lobster base bouillon which had a similar recipe on the label so I combined the two and it was easy and fabulous.  Modifications: 2 tbsp tomato paste, a bit extra Worcestershire sauce, replaced chicken broth with Lobster bouillon, 3/4 cup of chardonnay, half half rather than milk, and 25% more meat, and an extra tbsp. of flour.  I pureed the onion and some of the meat.  I actually tripled this recipe and it was fantastic the next day also!

I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except I used a little bit of crab with the lobster.  Also added some tomato paste and paprika for color.  This is a wonderful recipe that I loved, as did my children.  Thanks for posting it!

Such a wonderful bisque to make. Mind you it is impossible to follow the recipe. You find yourself throwing in extra broth here, some more spices there, thickening it up some more with flour/cornstarch. Everybody just has a preferrence and that's okay. I think this recipe is easy to toy with. My recommendations are as follows. . .
-use whipping cream as opposed to milk (keep it on low and constantly stir as to not let it scorch or settle)
-use more worcestershire and just an eencie bit more cayenne or tobasco.
-depending on what kind of bisque you like either chop up the lobster finely and have your bisque chunky, or cool it down once its all put together and blend it to really combine the ingredients. . .
-Lastly, I don't know about all of you but if you have a fresh lobster to use, barbecue that bad boy with some gnarly add ons (lemon, garlic, worcestershire, pepper, etc) just to get your meat prefunked before it goes in the pot. . .

What an easy and delicious bisque!  I thickened it up a little at the end by taking 3/4 cup of the soup and mixing it with a little flour then adding it back.  An excellent recipe.

Very good basic and simple recipe.  I added a bit more worsteshire, some garlic, used half milk/half heavy cream,and cayenne as other reviewers did, however, I also added a little of Sherry which really gave it the taste I was looking for.

I didn't have any regular milk, so I substituted half milk and half heavy cream.  I used sea salt instead of regular salt.  This recipe is so easy to fix and it is worthy of being served at a dinner party.  Absolutely delicious.

I followed one of the other posts and added half cup half and half, half a cup milk and a whole cup heavy cream.  Also added in old bay seasoning and parsley and a bit of garlic salt.  Turned out decent, but absolutely NOTHING to brag about.

I had made this many many times. It takes a while for the bisque to tighten up so instead of adding the lobster meat as instructed which will get tough, I add it at the end so the lobster meat stays sweet and tender. Please note:  I do add a piece of lobster when instructed (for flavor) but it is to tough to eat so I discard.

My hubby and I thought this was pretty good.  The one thing I will do differently next time is blend the lobster meat, as I did not like the chunks.  The flavor was very good, maybe just a tad too spicy.  Would make again with these changes.

Excellent recipe!  Substituted half & half for milk and added 1/4 C brandy.  Also added a bit more flour (to thicken) and worchestershire. Everyone raved and said it was the best they ever had. Thank you Wilma, this is definitely a keeper!

NatalieMac - If you're going to use the broth created by cooking the lobster make sure you don't add salt. I cooked a whole lobster using the recipe from this site which calls for adding 1 TBSP of salt per quart of water. Adding that broth to this soup nearly got me sick it was soooooo salty. I also have a larger family so if I were to do this again I would look at doing double the recipe without doubling the lobster.

This was lovely...to the last drop!  I did alter the original recipe with all of "Michi in Miami"'s adjustments....to fine tune I used 4 tsp of the tomato puree, 1 1/2 tsp of Worcestershire  sauce and instead of milk, used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2....we "tasted" it prior to dinner and my guests ate it all...it never made the table....outstanding!  A nice buttery chardonnay pairs nicely! :)

AMAZING with the following suggestions taken from here: saute chopped onion and 2 minced cloves of garlic in olive oil before adding chicken broth, whisk 3 tbs butter with 3 tbs flour, use 1 cup half & half, 1 cup skim milk, 1/2 cup white wine, 1 tsp Worcestershire, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/4 teaspoon thyme, 2 cups lobster, simmer on low for an hour.  Found this to be the perfect consistency, spice, and amount for 2!

This recipe is so good!  I used  heavy cream instead of milk cuz I had some left to get rid of and added a pinch more of the cayenne pepper.  Thank you for sharing it.  I will be making this a regular part of our menu.

My husband and I make this using imitation crab, 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of half and half.  Splash in a little white wine, add some white pepper and a little more worchestershire and it is superb.  We also pureed it until smooth.

I really like the taste and simplicity of this recipe.  I made a couple of modifications.  First, the base of the recipe was made just as it is called for with chicken broth, onion, butter, and flour.  Then, I added heavy cream instead of milk, and Campbell's Tomato Soup for some extra flavor, and color.  Next, I added the salt, Worcestershire, and cayenne pepper.  I added 3 - 6 oz. cans of crab meat, instead of the lobster, but it tastes very similiar.  For a little extra spunk, I also added one can of small shrimp.  One note to mention, remember to cook the onions all the way through before adding to the rest of the mixture.

This recipe is really easy and delicious.  I doubled the cayenne because we like our food spicy.  I'll definitely make it again, but next time I will cut the lobster in small, fine pieces instead of cubed.

I loved, love, loved ths soup.  It was easy and probably the best soup I ever had.  I made some changes based on what I had on hand.  I used scallops cooked with olive oil & garlic instead of lobster.  I used one cup of heavy cream and one cup of milk instead of 2 cups of milk.  I added a couple of heaping tablespoons of vodka spaghetti sauce (cuz I didn't have tomato paste) but I will always add that from now on becuase I think that was what took it from really good to really, really great.  I can't wait to make this again - and again and again.

This tasted like onion soup. I also didn't enjoy the amount of chunky in the soup. I did chop the onions rather than slice. Since I didn't like the full size of the onions I put the soup in a blender to make it creamy. I thought  'bisque' is a creamy soup not chunky. Not sure if I will make this again.

For a simple soup this is definatly a 5 star recipe. After reading the reviews I decided to add 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, 4 tablespoons of butter and 4 tablespoons of flour. I also chopped the onions, but my husband and I agree not to chop them again. With the lobster we shredded it, and it kept the soup hearty. YUM!

This was easier to make that I thought it would be.  I couldn't get lobster because the commissary didn't have any, so I used crab meat instead.  I only gave it 4 stars in part because we didn't care for it that much.  I will try it again with lobster though, but if I can't find lobster I might try it with scallops.  I think that crab meat was a poor substitute.

This recipe was very quick and easy to make.  Tastes good.  Defnitely add the tomato paste as suggested by other reviews.  It helps with the colour and adds a bit of flavour but doesn't overpower the lobster.

This was the best and I could not have found a better recipe.  As with all the others, I made the same changes; doubled the butter/flour, used 1cup whipping cream, 1/2 c half and half and 1/2 c milk.  Added more worchestire and cayene and added 2 tbl ketchup (did not have tomato paste on hand)  This was awesome!!!!

Great recipe! So easy... I added a little extra flour and a dash of paprika and garlic. It had great flavor! I also added a few chives for a little green color and let it simmer for about half an hour. Delicious!

This was the most amazing seafood bisque I've ever had in my life. Great recipe, will definitely make over and over again. My only recommendation is to add some creole seasoning and garlic powder to give it a bit more kick, and to use half and half instead of milk! I have also made this with crab meat instead of lobster, and it came out just lovely.

A fantastic and easy recipe. I followed the advice of some others and added tomato paste and upped the cayenne and worchester sauce. I also had alot to serve and being that lobster is expensive here in the midwest, I added a pound of scallops to the pound of lobster when doubling the recipe. The flavor and texture was excellent.

I was very happy with this recipe, although I took several suggestions from other cooks.  I used half cream and half milk but it tastes just as good and is much healthier with two cups of milk.  I bought packaged pre-cooked imitation lobster meat and the taste was wonderful, although I would suggest cutting the meat into smaller pieces.  I also added ½ tsp chili pepper
¼ tsp pepper
¼ tsp parsley
¼ tsp garlic powder
FANTASATIC!

THE ONLY PROBLEM IS WE DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND IT STILL WASN'T ENOUGH!!VERY RICH AND CREAMY.GOOD SIZE PIECES OF LOBSTER MEAT GIVE IT MORE SUBSTANCE THAN A PUREED BISQUE.

I don't eat seafood, but the Fiance gives this 5 stars!  I did try it and it wasn't that bad but he LOVED it.  He said that he would have eaten the whole thing if he could but he was full.  The only thing I would do differently is a fix the one mistake I made of chopping the onions and putting it in the soup.  he would have preffered NOT doing this. (it was a suggestion made in a review and he loves onion but said it just didn't taste quite right)  My dad was a chef at a local seafood restaurant yet i DONT eat seafood.  I had about 3 tablespoons of the broth but wouldn't eat the chunks!  Because I don't eat seafood, I didn't know where to get lobster, so i got imitation lobster (1 LB for $6) and he said it tasted GREAT!  I did 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream and also took half of the soup in the blender and put it back in with the soup to chop up some of the pieces and make the soup a little thicker (we like thick soup).  I didn't do the whole thing becuase I know he likes the chunks too.  I was going to freeze some for him for easy pulloutofthefreezerandhavethenextdayfor lunch, but it will probably be gone by today.  I'll have to make it again when he isn't home and put containers in the freezer or he will probably eat it all.  Great recipe to keep the fiance wanting to marry me!  Thanks so much!!!

This WON my boyfriend over!!!! Only changes I made was that I used 1 pound of crawfish (readily available in the freezer at Walmart for about 7 bucks) and I added a splash of Zattarran's Shrimp and Crab boil, with fresh cracked black pepper just before serving....FANTASTIC!!!! Very easy recipe!!!

I loved this recipe! I had bought some little cooked lobster tails, about shrimp size, from Trader Joe's and they worked perfect for this. I used skim milk for half and nonfat half and half for the rest. Who needs to clog their arteries, just for a good soup? I would mince the onions next time, I think. I also added a little more cayenne, which gives a nice touch of heat to the sweet lobster. My family loved it and I will definitely be trying it again. Maybe with crab, next time. Yum!!

This recipe is greatly enhanced if you use a fish/shellfish/seafood stock instead of chicken broth. That and you should add Michi in Miami's modifications. Then it's perfect.

This recipe was very easy and extremely good. I used crab and heavy whipping cream. I also added a bit of black pepper and took an extra cup of the whipping cream and beat it til it was light and fluffy and slowly folded it in to make it a bit thicker. I floated a few pieces of crab on top of each individual bowl and sprinkled a little parsley over the floating crab.

Super easy.  We substituted crawfish meat for lobster and it was great.  I bet its even better with lobster.  My husband thought it would be really good as a sauce over pasta if it were a bit thicker, I'll give that a go next time.

Wonderful! Very easy and perfectly delicious. I used 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy cream, but would have been fine with all milk. Thanks for the great recipe. I'll be making this often.

I made this recipe but was confused by the instructions, specifically the "2 Slices Onion". It seems as if onion is added at two different points, and I wasn't sure if it was two slices of onion or two onions sliced. Regardless, I used 1 1/2 medium/large onions and did the rest according to the directions and it tasted wonderful and probably could have used a little more cayenne. Thank you for the simple recipe!

very good - i made only a few adjustments; i doubled the recipe however used three pounds of fresh lobster tails flash cooked in a skillet with a dab of butter and cubed it (a bit more expensive but worth it), substituted heavy whipping cream for the milk and added three table spoons of tomato paste, a bit more worcestershire sauce and a bit more cayenne pepper.  absolutely excellent.

I made this recipe exactly only using crab meat instead of lobster and did not change anything as others have and it was awful to me and my husband who really loves bisque of any kind.  I used 2 lbs of crab meat since it called for 2lbs of lobster and that was way too much meat so I think 1/2 lb would have sufficed.  After it was done and I tasted it and didn't like the taste, I did add a little garlic salt, more worchestershire, pepper and cayene but that provided little improvement.  So on this soup, I'll leave it to the restaurants!

I followed michi from miami's review by adding a few tbs of tomato paste (I used 3 tbs) to give it that nice pink colour. I also subbed the milk for heavy cream, however, i think 2 cups of heavy cream makes the soup too heavy. I'd do 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk next time. Instead of using chicken broth, I boiled lobster shells in water and used "lobster broth" to give it a better lobster taste. I also added the lobster meat right before serving instead of letting it get all chewy. I also let the bisque simmer for about an hour as suggested by michi.

This one was just ok.  It was definitely bland for our taste, and that was after already adding creole seasoning and the cayenne pepper.  I might make it again, if I could figure out what was missing.

My boyfriend loves lobster bisque soup. I made this for him with some left over lobster tail. I add 3 tablespoons tomato puree, a couple cloves of garlic and some old bay seasoning and parsley. I let it simmer for an hour very YUMMY. He said it was the best he ever had.

This was AMAZING!!!  I made it for Valentines Day for my husband as the starter course.  He had 2 full bowls and didn't want the dinner.  He said he thought we were at a fancy restaurant it was so good.  Made slight changes based on other reviews - added a couple tsps of tomato paste and garlic with the onion - I used shallots.  I used 2 4oz tails that I boiled and chopped up ahead of time.  My husband said that it was better than a restaurant because every bite actually had chunks of lobster in it.  Thank you for this recipe.  I've already passed it on to 3 friends.

I literally just got done eating this bisque. And dear lord it is delicious!!! Def the best soup ive ever made and possibly the best ive ever had. I followed MICHI IN MIAMI's suggestions and used heavy cream instead of milk, added more Worcestershire, more cayenne, and 2 Tbl of tomato paste. I also added a dash or old bay, oh and some black pepper. It was so good, i cant get over it. i might have to make this for a pot luck sometime. Thanks for this awesome recipe

This bisque was GREAT! I made it for my daughter-in-law when she came home from the hospital with my first grandchild (a boy, he is beautiful!) and we both loved it!  I looked at a bunch of recipes for bisque and checked all the reviews, and added 2 Tbsp of tomato paste as well, and some crabmeat (I only bought 2 small lobster tails) and it was so tasty!  This one's a keeper, I've put this in my "favorite recipes!"

Very good, but I thought this was more like a chowder than a bisque.  Next time I make it, I will try to make it a just a bit thicker and puree it.  I also added a bit of tomato paste for flavor and color.  Thanks for sharing!

I used crawfish meat instead of lobster meat in this recipe. It was easy to make and tasted delicious!

This was simple and delicious.  I added shrimp and crab meat to expand the flavor.  The only other alteration I made was to use half-and-half intstead of milk.  Overall it was very very good!

This turned out so good that my wife is still talking about it. I cooked a whole lobster and after removing the meat I returned the shells to the pot and made a lobster broth. I also took other reviewers suggestions and chopped the onions, used 1/2 &1/2, 2t tomato paste,more Worcestershire, and cayenne.

This recipe is better than the one made at my favorite 5 star restaurant. I am land locked so I made this with imitation crab and I prefer my bisque to have a lot of body, so I pureed some crab with the soup and mixed it back into the bisque.  EXCELLENT!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I followed other reviewer's suggestions to add tomato paste, garlic, and pepper. I was doubling the recipe so I used one of those small cans of tomato paste, 2 cloves of garlic crushed, and pepper to taste. I also used lowfat milk and fat free half and half and the soup was plenty creamy. I used shrimp instead of lobster and I didn't use worcestshire sauce because I didn't have any. With these modifications it was a fantastic bisque that my entire family, from the 5 year old to the 50 year old, really enjoyed.

THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER MADE LOBSTER BISQUE AND IT WAS A COMPLETE SUCCESS.  I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE MAKING IT AND USED THE ADVICE OF THE OTHER COOKS.  I CHOPPED THE ONIONS INSTEAD OF SLICING THEM, USED 2 CUPS OF HEAVY CREAM INSTEAD OF MILK, ADDED GARLIC POWDER AND TOMATO PASTE, AND SOME WHITE WINE.  I ALSO USED TWO CHICKEN BOUILLON CUBES WITH TWO CUPS OF WATER FOR THE CHICKEN STOCK.  IF I WERE TO DO IT AGAIN, I WOULD ADD ONLY ONE BOUILLON CUBE AND  ONE CUP OF HEAVY CREAM WITH ONE CUP OF MILK.  I DIDN'T HAVE CAYENNE PEPPER SO I JUST USED BLACK PEPPER.

I substituted shrimp for lobster and it was great... Although I had to add more flour to thicken it.

I really enjoyed this! I also followed the advice of another poster and added more spice to give it some kick as well as 2-3 TBL of tomato paste for some color. In addition, I used 1C half & half as well as fat free half & half instead of milk. It was nice and creamy. Then I kinda "cheated" an added a couple cubed new potatoes (I know, it makes it more a chowder than a bisque but I really wanted it to have more texture). But I will definitely make this again.

Very good.  I still need to tweak.  First of all I needed to make it gluten free... I used sorghum flour and a pinch of xanthan gum.  Seemed to work well.  Next I added about 3/4 c. rendered sherry, tripled the butter and used half-and-half instead of milk.  Only about 14 oz lobster meat.  Tried to emulsify with an immersion blender but the meat resisted a great deal.  Next time I will add more worcestershire... I did add a little extra cayenne and salt and that punched it up some, but I think it can get better.

We followed suggestions.  We doubled the recipe and we used 2 cups of milk, 2 cups of cream and a little over a lb of lobster.  Chopped two shallots and satueed in chicken broth.  Then added the Cayanne Pepper and Worchester Sauce to taste.  Fantastic.

We enjoyed it and I liked that it was made with milk instead of cream. Next time I would use less lobster and cut it smaller. I would put a little more onion, worcestershire and cayenne. I have already started thinking about other ways to use the base of the soup like adding chicken and corn instead of lobster. Lots of options!

This recipe is pretty good. I used half/half, more wrcster sauce, more cayenne pepper, more salt and pepper, and DEFINETLY more flour, a little more than double what it calls for. Just make you taste it after every addition of anything, because it's really easy to go over on the caynne. Added garlic powder and a bit of parsley and that's as close you can get it to restaurant style with this recipe.

Wonderful. My family loves it. I followed other readers' suggestions and chopped the onion (I used about half a small onion), half and half instead of milk, a bit more cayenne, and I used lump crabmeat instead of lobster meat. I served it with crusty bread and green salad.

This recipe is outstanding!  After the first bite we started giggling because it was *so  good* that we couldn't believe that it came out of our kitchen!  I served it with fresh bread and a salad, and it was absolutely perfect.  Like others, I doctored the recipe a little.  I used more butter & flour (4 Tb of each), and I added two healthy sprinkles of cayenne pepper, and two shakes of Northwoods seasoning (similar to Old Bay).  We both thought that the cayenne was integral to the recipe... but couldn't have identified it if we hadn't known what was in there.  It just gave the soup a depth that would have been missing otherwise.

I followed the directions, and switched out the milk for half-and-half, and it had a decent consistency.  Unfortunately, it seems that 1 lb of crab meat was way too much.  I'd do like half next time.

needed more flavor - the worcestershire sauce added some flavor a long with the cayenne pepper so I added the lobster juice.  I also diced the onions, not chopped.  Very easy and yummy and easy.

I made this bisque a few months back and it was the best I've ever had.  I tried to find the recipe again and had a rough time.  I tried another and it was nowhere near as good as this one.  I'm sooooo relieved I found it again!!  My man can't stop telling me how amazing it is as he gobbles every last bite.  The reason I tried this to begin with is because I had all the ingredients, minus the lobster.  Several others were more complicated and I didn't have everything.  Seems simple is best!  I have added to my favorites and again am very happy I found this again after not writing it down!  Thanks!

We're not big seafood eaters and I had some langoustinos I didn't know how to cook.  After reading about 40 reviews of this recipe I figured I could fake my way to something great with the ingredients I had as the recipe seems very forgiving.  I doubled the roux to 3-4T flour and the same of butter, used 1.5 onions, diced and sauteed, no garlic(!), about a quart of veggy stock, a couple cups of milk, maybe a cup of cream, about 3-4 T of tomato paste, some frozen chopped spinach, and 12oz of chopped pre-cooked langoustinos. While the end result was probably more a soup than a bisque, it was really quite tasty; even my two year old ate it happily.

Excellent!  I added about 1/4 cup of Sherry and it tasted like the best bisque I've ever had in any restaurant.  Won't be paying big bucks for this anymore now that I know how easy it is to make!  I used lactose free milk and it was still delicious.

We are on a school budget so we used Lobster "sticks", canned crab and shrimp to flavor our Bisque. It was wonderful!We added a small can of tomato paste for color and flavor. We also added some seasoned salt and Old Bay. Remember to add the seafood for only the last 40 minutes or so. Add it too early it will be tough.

Made this with fresh cracked crab leg meat instead of lobster.  Using some of the modifications suggested I used half & half instead of milk,shallots instead of onion, added cyanne pepper, and used tomato sauce to give it that thick "bisque-ness".  I'll definatly make this one again.  Husband and I both love it as a meal.

I felt the need to add lobster liquor for additional lobster flavor, however it turned out pretty good anyway. I did nearly double the spices and added garlic powder to this, as well as added some shrimp.

This was sooooo good, I used 2 cartons of clam base instead of chicken broth, used half and half instead of milk, I also did not use the Worcestershire sauce, and used the imitation meat to cut down on the cost but I added in 2 lbs of raw shrimp, and I served it over big chunks of fresh baked bread to soak up some of the juices.  This is the best bisque I have ever eaten.

Great Bisque...quick and easy.  I followed some of the other reviewer suggestions (love that about this site:) and upped the worccestershire and cayenne pepper to taste.  I also added about half of a small can of tomato paste.  I was a little hesitant to do this but it really boosted the over all flavor.  I also doubled the recipe and used imitation crab and some leftover shrimp (being budget minded).  After it had cooked for a bit, I put about a third of it in my blender and than added it back in.  This made for a very rich and creamy soup.  I also used all half and half instead of just milk.  Will be making this again.

I changed this by adding 1 cup heavy cream & reducing the regular milk to 1 cup. I also added 2 tsp paprika for flavor and colour without it the bisquye looks too white.I also doubled the Wostecher sauce. Every one raves about this. My husbands favorite.

AMAZING !!
I was lucky enough to have frsh lobster on hand. Did as was suggested by others and used 1c cream and 1c milk. Also added a splash of white wine with the onions and some fresh garlic. One small can of tomato paste and the it turned out beyond my expectations. Thanks so much for a recipe I will make time and time again!

Wonderful recipe! I substituted lobster with crayfish and added some lobster broth and lemon to the bisque. I also put half a tablespoon of flour extra into the butter so the bisque came out nice and thick. Great recipe! Thanks!

Tasty and easy to make. The base would be better if it were thicker. Load it up the lobster!! Add a little more cayenne for a kick!

An absolutely great recipe!!  This is easy to make with limited ingredients.   I did make a few changes after reading other reviews and also made a few changes of my own.   Instead of onions I used two shallots minced. I added 1/4 tsp of white pepper along with black pepper to taste.   I added 3 T of tomatoe paste, light cream instead of milk,and I doubled the worcestershire and cayenne.   I also added 1/2 t garlic powder and used unsalted butter.  The soup simmer for 1-2 hours.   Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

Wonderful recipe - I also chopped the onions, doubled the Worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper and added 8 oz. mushrooms sauteed in chicken broth, a good-sized splash of Marsala wine, and plenty of garlic powder.  I like a creamy bisque so used light cream instead of milk.  Delicious!

I found this recipe to be very quick, easy & good!  I used imitation crabmeat, & I'm going to use shrimp when I make it again for a change.  I also used green onions.  This would be a good base for mushroom soup if you didn't want to use seafood.

Very good soup.  I had some Lobster bisque at a French restaurant in Hawaii, and I was hoping this was similar.  It wasn't, but still very good.  It could use a bit more flavor, maybe some spices, but I will make it again.

I added a can of tomato paste...probably too much. Then added more worcestershire and cayenne. I had 1 can of lobster and also about 2 cups of baby scallops to make a seafood bisque. My guys enjoyed this bisque perhaps more than I did.

Really great flavor! I wish I had seafood base instead of chicken, but it was very tasty. I used half and half. I found it made exactly four servings. I chopped my lobster up and waited until about 5 min before serving to add, bc I did not want it to overcook.

This was wonderful!! After reading reviews (after all, a recipe is only a guide for those of us who love to cook:) I used langostino instead of lobster, easier to work with and great flavor. Also used my electric hand held blender to thicken soup. Taking others suggestions, I added the garlic powder, a bit more cayanne pepper and some Old Bay seasoning, as well a couple tbs or so of cooking Sherry. (I made it for 6 servings) Fresh parsely from the garden and it was a big hit with my family.

LACTOSE-FREE VERSION! I made the following changes: Instead of milk, I used 2 cups almond of milk. Since almond milk won't thicken quite like regular milk, I used 3 tablespoons of flour + 4 tablespoons margarine to make the roux. Additionally, I added 1/2 cup non-dairy sour cream to help a little with the creaminess. I also did what the others did, by adding 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp parsley and garlic powder, 1 tbls worcestershire sauce, and 3 tbls tomato sauce. Don't forget to let the soup simmer for at elast 30 mins, stirring occasionally. This soup did not taste like flour or almonds, but had a great light taste that complimented the lobster!

This was an excellent base recipe!!!  I doubled the recipe and ended up using 3 cups of chicken stock and 1 can of evaporated milk.  It came out perfectly creamy!  I blended up half the contents to make it a half bisque/half lobster stew and this added to the creamyness of it.  I also added more worcestershire sauce and onions that the recipe called for.  It is spectacular!!!  I think that you can't go wrong with this recipe or adjusting it to your particular tastes.  I definitely recommend blending half the contents as this makes it a really nice texture.

This is an awesome bisque! Our family (and friends who have tasted it) love it. We add lots of fresh garlic to it and use fat-free half & half instead of milk and we double the recipe because it's so good!

Tasty!  Altered a little though.  Did not have Worcestershire sauce, so I added a packet of soy sauce.  Also did the medium slices of onion.  However, these were large when eating the soup, so next time I will dice before putting in the skillet.

This bisque was great!  Like most people, I made a few changes.  First, my fiance is lactose intolerant so I made it with Lactaid whole milk and it still came out very creamy.  Second, I added a little Old Bay and extra W. sauce.  Finally, I let it cook for about 30 minutes on low heat.  It was really perfect!

This was GREAT !  I did make my own changes, I did not add worchestershire sauce or cayenne pepper, I used about 2 tablespoons of red onion, and I added garlic and sundried tomatoes, both minced as small as I could get them.  I also used about 2 tablespoons of dry sherry,  a pinch of black pepper, and about 2 teaspoons of old bay.  It was INCREDIBLY easy to make, I believe the prep time is what took me the longest with the cutting of my red onion, garlic, and sundried tomatoes, and instead of lobster I used shrimp, crabmeat, and pan seared scallops.  To cook this maybe took all of ten minutes, maybe 15, but it was worth the wait.  It was great, the best bisque I've ever had, will be living off of this recipe when the winter hits !

This is a good recipe, just not amazing.  I will make it again, although not for my husband as I found out he doesn't like seafood bisques.  As other reviewers suggested I used 4 T butter and 4 T flour to and added garlic (1-2 cloves), old bay seasoning (just a bit), and some parsley (maybe a tsp).  Instead of the cayenne (didn't have any) I added a few shakes of hot sauce.  Unlike many other reviewers I used milk (skim) and the consistency was fine.  Many of the reviews also called for tomato paste, but didn't have any so put a few squirts of ketchup (after tasting and realizing it was missing something) in there and it added a lot to the dish.  To keep a little more budget friendly used shrimp/crab instead of lobster and it was just fine.  It would have been bland without the additional seasonings.

Super bomb!  I made this for valentines day, used six lobster tails, made the stock from the tails, didn't have paste so used two tsp catsup, added dried pepper flakes instead of cayenne, and more seasonings and worst. like the other reviewers.  The next day I made crab bisque with left over king crab meat (we ate too much bisque to finish the crab) this time i used tom. paste and white wine,  it wasn't near as good with the paste/wine, but still good had we had not just had the OUTSTANDING lobster version we'd probably have liked it better.

We love this.  I used imitation lobster (when I could find it...it's not easy to find down here) and I have used crab meat.  Both turned out great.

I made this for my 11 yr. old son's birthday and he loved it!  I took some of the other's suggestion and added the tomato paste.  I couldn't believe how easy and good this was!

This was awesome but I made a lot of changes.  I used canned salmon instead of lobster and added dill.  I also used shrimp stock instead of the chicken stock.  Everyone ate it and asked that I make it again.  Great recipe and easy to vary according to what you have on hand.

This was fabulous! I made some minor changes just based on the amount of things I had on hand, but basically followed the recipe. Very easy to make! The reviewer that said to puree or finely chop some of the lobster was right on...that gave it the perfect texture. I will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!, I did a couple of different things thanks to some previous suggestions.  I had left over crawfish tails from a crawfish boil so used that instead of lobster.  1 cup whipping cream , 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup whole milk.  Onion was diced and also added little bit of green onion at the end.  I added 1/2 cup of frozen white corn, talk about yummy! 3 pinches of cayenne and little more salt.  My teenager loved it! Thank you for sharing this

Made the change of using heay whipping cream.. Sauted shrimp and used the remaining butter in the bisque.  Made sure I added lots of lobster meat, but also made sure I was very careful how much cayenne pepper was added.

Wow!  I havent ever had a lobster bisque, let alone made one so this was a nice first try!  I did add some pepper about 1/4 cup parmesean cheesse and did half crab half lobster (and all I had was imitation).  It came out fantastic (even with the imitation).  We served it with some baguettes and loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was just OK. I followed the recipe exactly and it never really thickened up. But my kids liked it, hence the four stars.

Good Soup. My mom enjoyed it more than I did. It was definitely better than the lobster bisque i purchased. I think it need to be a lil thicker so i recommend 3 TBS butter/ 3 TBS flour. I will make again when i have company but probably not for myself.

Very good bisque!  I followed the advice of others and used 1 C. half and half and then 1 C. milk. I added more worcertshire sauce and a pinch more of cayenne pepper.  I also used 1/2 imitation lobster and half canned crab (kept the price down).  It was very creamy and delicious and my whole family loved it!  There was none left after dinner!  Thanks to Wilma!

I loved this soup, the only problem that I found is that it is a bit to thin, so I used some corn starch to thicken it up, and it seemed to do the trick.

Absolutely the best bisque I've ever had.  However, instead of chicken broth I used the shell of the lobster I was using for meat to make a lobster stock, which I think added a lot of true lobster flavor to the dish.  This did add a lot of time to the preparation, though, so I wouldn't recommend doing so unless you have a free day.

Just right.  I tasted it before the lobster went in.  All it would take is oysters and I'd have my grandmother's oyster stew.  Yum.

Made this for my Valentine with a big salad.  Awesome.

I replace 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream.  Next time I'll use all the lobster I have and make a full recipe instead of for 4.  Plus make the salad first.  This soup goes together very fast.  It was scrumptious.

Substitude heavy whipping cream for milk. Double cheyanne pepper and add just a couple tablespoons of tomatoe puree or a dash of tomato paste. Make sure you minch onions if your family isnt a fan of onions. Its great when white pepper added to taste too. Easy to reheat, heck, even good cold as left over! Oh, whoever mentioned simmering for an hour had a great suggetion. If its too thick, instead of heavy cream, try 1/2 + 1/2, but just milk loses some of the yummy factor. This is always my main dish since its so rich and delicious,  just add a roll or piece of bread and a salad, and its an excellent meal for the family!  Many, MANY thanks to those who are original posters. Ive learned so much from you who know enough to share their recipes. I always learn the most important aspects of cooking each dish from you. I then read the tweaks of others, decide which sound like improvements, and apply what i feel my family would enjoy most. Between the two, i almost always end up with a personalized version just right for me. Thanks to so many who are willing to share their culinary knowledge. My mother was a dietician who knew how to throw leftovers together to make the most delicious soups but she passed before i learned enough to know how to do this. She always said as long as you add something sweet everytime you added something sour, the balance would blend to make the taste wonderful, but i still dont understand which vegitables are considered which. Is cabbage a sweet or sour?

This bisque is a treat and so easy to make.  I, too, had to make some adjustments due to family allergy issues, and it turned out fabulous.  I added extra Worcestershire sauce and butter and added garlic and some red pepper flakes, but omitted the onion and salt.

Love this recipe!  I will definitely make this again.  The tomato paste and garlic suggestion was very helpful...the flavor was amazing.  I didn't happen to have chicken broth on hand, only veggie broth, so I used it and added  two chicken bouillon cubes (omitted the extra salt).   Used Cajun seasoning instead of cayenne , as well as Old Bay it turned out with an incredible depth of flavor.  Hope these suggestions are helpful!  Kallie

This was my first ever attempt at making lobster bisque and am I glad I gave it a try.  I only wish I hadn't waited so long.  This quick and easy bisque has wonderful flavor and the cayenne pepper was just enough to make it really warm you up inside.  I had only a small amount of lobster (about 8 ounces), but followed the recipe proportions, with the exception of the lobster meat.  I did substitute lobster base for the chicken broth.  I cooked my lobster tail in lightly salted water then added a little "Better Than Broth Lobster base" to taste.  I used skim milk which tasted great, those wanting a richer soup could certainly use a higher fat content milk.  My husband and son were both looking for seconds which I unfortunately did not have.  Will plan on making this again very soon.

I made it as stated in the recipe, but doubled it. It needed some flavor enhancers. So I added some garlic salt, a splash more worcestershire sauce, two skinned and pureed Roma tomatoes, and a little Zatarans Creole seasoning. It was on the thin side, but the flavor was good.

I am severely dissapointed with this recipe. Athough I have never had Lobster Bisque before, I am certain that is not what it's supposed to taste like. Mind you, I followed this recipe TO THE "T"! It was bland and I am sorely sorry that I wasted a perfectly good lobster tail on this. I even took the suggestion of another reviewer and grilled the tail first and basted it in garlic lemon butter. I will never make this again.

Pretty good.  I added 3 tbs. of tomato paste, doubled the cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce, substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for 1 cup of milk, and added about a dozen shrimp.  I'll make this one again.  Maybe next time I'll add some fresh corn.

This soup was incredible and easy! I followed some of the recommendations.  I doubled the worchestershire and chopped the onions.  I also used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and crab instead of lobster.  I didn't add the tomatoe paste.  My husband loved it with a little Sherry drizzled over top.

This was a GREAT start to a GREAT BISQUE.  I used Shrimp instead of Lobster and half and half instead of milk.  Added a little more onion and OH MY GOODNESS was this the BEST EVER! OH and the Chicken Broth I used had roasted garlic in it so it added to the flavor. as well

My husband actually said it as better than the lobster we had the left iovers from---I added more cayenne and more worcheshire and a little tomato paste and 1/2 And 1/2.  So simple yet extraordinary!

I think the flavor of this dish was ok, nothing exceptional, but it was a little on the thin side and didn't quite live up to my expectations.  Hubby said it was good, but I'm not sure he wasn't just complimenting the effort of making him an entire seafood dinner.  I'll give it another shot eventually - hopefully I just didn't do something quite right since everyone else has rated it so highly.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe pretty much as written and it turned out great.  I did use skim milk, and added axtra cayenne and Tobasco.  We thought it had a good flavor considering the simplicity of the recipe.

This was a great recipie. I tend to like most of my food spicy and on the 'lighter' side. I modified this to use low cal butter substitute and added extra paprika.

My housemates and I loved this soup, although I doctored it a lot.  I used corn flour (one roommate has a wheat allergy) which worked nicely.  I followed some other tips and added garlic with the onions, used some heavy cream (1/2 c) instead of all milk, and added 3 T tomato paste.  I didn't have worcestershire, so I added thyme, black pepper and 1 T of cooking sherry.  I also threw in some corn and avocado just because.  It turned out wonderfully and I would recommend any or all of the changes I made.

This recipe is great and super simple!  I chopped the onion and used whole milk and frozen lobster meat.  No need to use cream or half and half, in my opinion.

Incredible!  Minor changes:  used half and half, 1 tsp. cayenne, 2 tsp. Worcestershire, veg. broth, 2 cloves of pressed garlic, 2 tsp. chicken boullion, sauted lobster in extra butter and simmered for 2 hours, which I think was the key to making this soup so unbelieveable.  Served eight guests and they all raved about it.

This was the first time I have made bisque at home.  It was excellent.  After it was cooked, I did use the blender to give it more of a creamy texture.  It is as good, if not better, than my favorite restuarant!

Delicious, especially with previously recommended changes:  chopped the onion, added tomato paste, doubled the Worcestershire, used 1/2 & 1/2.  Also sauteed the onion and the lobster in butter...if only I'd added a bit of vermouth...it would've been a 5!  Ahhh, next time.

i agree with the others. This may need alittle more flour or cream. Was a bit thin but still good. This could definately be a base for any seafood(shrimp, crab, even oysters). Thanks for the recipe.

I hate when people rate a recipe but then totally make it their own....but here I am. So I doubled the recipe and instead of 4 slices  of onion I used 2 small  whole onions sliced and cooked in about a cup of broth.  Instead of using all milk I used 3 cups of milk and one small carton of whipping cream. I puréed a can of stewed tomatoes and puréed the onion slices that were cooked in the broth and added that to the broth prior to the milk.  I upped the cayenne to about 3/4 teaspoon and added about 2 tsp of onion salt.  After all my changes, it as amazing.

I found a lobster bisque at Walmart, that I love. I've had other seafood bisque and dont really care for the spiciness. The Walmart marketside bisque let's the sweet flavor of lobster, be the star. I made this recipe without the cayenne, added a dash of old bay, a little garlic powder, and a pinch of sugar to get that sweetness. I used shrimp that I threw in the food processor for a couple spins. Turned out great! Maybe next time, I'll half the worcheshire. Not a huge fan of that either.

I followed the reviews and used beer to steam the lobster and use as a soup base, cooking the empty shells and a celery stalk int the left over beer for an hour. 
It was AMAZING. 
I added four cups of chicken stock to the beer along with 1 sautéed onion, 6 stalks of celery & 8 cloves of garlic. I pureed half of the that and added it to the soup base along with three Tbs. of tomato paste and a dash of Old Bay seasoning .  Like others, I doubled the flour and Worcestershire sauce to the base. Cooked for an hour before adding 1 and 1/2 cups half and half and simmered another half hour.  Added the lobster just before serving. Really awesome!! Everyone said it was a 5 star course that would pay for - will make this again for sure.

I made this with leftover shellfish and it was a hit! Only changed the recipe to suit what I had on hand so it wasn’t  exact but everyone loved it and it was pretty close.

LOVE this. Made it twice. Next time I'm just going to make a double batch. I add a tablespoon of sherry I saw from another recipe. Doubled up on the butter, flour and broth. 

Update. I added organic frozen corn and 1 cooked potato. Very tasty.

I made no changes but I did follow the video and went by that and not the recipe. I think I'll try the same with Gulf shrimp next time.

This was good as it but I did alter the recipe. For my notes, I simmered the cooked lobster tails, then with leftover steam water and shells , added  g. onion, celery seed, sage branch, in half & half for about an hour. Strain pot. Melt butter, add onion till brown, then add flour. Then whisk in seasoned milk, stock, cayenne, 3 T tomato paste, worst sauce. Simmer 10-20 add paprika and chopped lobster.  Turned out great!

This bisque was wonderful! My variations....I substituted a cup of heavy cream for one of the cups of milk and added some cooking sherry. Not sure I would add that amount of parsley next time but I will make this again.

The flavor was amazing, and I made it a seafood Bisque, adding shrimp and scallops. After reading many reviews, I took he suggestions of adding butter, and also flour to make it thicker. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 in place of half of the milk.

Substituted peeled crawfish tails for the lobster.  Added chopped bell pepper, a little finely diced celery and jalopeno pepper and a lot of black pepper.  It was sublime!

Tasted spectacular, and very easy to follow. I sprinkled some old bay on top in each serving bowl, which adds a whole extra layer of flavor. 

We agreed that the leftover lobster in here was better than the fresh lobster the night before!

Was looking for a good Lobster Bisque.  I tried this one, came out awesome. The only things I changed; I warmed milk in sauce pan and whisked 1/2 can tomato paste  into milk. I used a white wine instead of sherry.  Used 2 cups broth from lobsters I had cooked and 1 cup chicken broth.  I also cut down on the flour, it became to thick with the 1/2 c of flour. 
Delicious! I will definetly make again now that I have a good recipe!

Awful recipe! I made changes by purring the ingredients otherwise would have been a lumpy soup, but still remained fairly tasteless. Directions were not clear: I was confused by two slices of medium onion and had too much onion bc diced two medium onions , which was way too much

Oh my goodness..this recipe, along with a few suggested and dietary tweaks, was soo yummy!! I added a tablespoon of tomato paste, a bit more cayenne and a bit more worsheshire sauce and used canned crab meat and baby shrimp. My boyfriend loved it! Don't drain the juice from the crab meat though! Use it in the broth! Since we are both lactose-intolerant, I used 2 parts canned unsweetened coconut milk and 1 part unsweetened almond milk and it was still wonderfully creamy without tasting like coconut! I was afraid of that but did not taste the soup until it was just about finished and I was extremely pleasantly surprised! This is such a simple and wonderful recipe! Definitely adding this to the books!

Delicious with a few added touches. As others recommended  i finely chopped the onions, and garlic and sauteed in butter and then vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. . i used an immersion blender after i combined the onions with the white sauce.  Sundried tomatoes were a great addition. i added the lobster near the end, just to heat and not overcook.  i will definitely make this again.

I made this with barely any actual lobster meat. I used the lobster tail shells for my stock which gives in a great flavor. I can only imagine this recipe being better with actual lobster in the soup.

This is a four star recipe as written and 5 star with adding 1/8 cup sherry, 2tbsp tomato paste, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and replace milk with half and half. Restaurant quality! The flour amount called for was perfect. The people who complained it wasn’t, most likely did not bring the soup to an almost boil for it to thicken up. I added the cooked langostino lobster the last 5 minutes of cooking, lowered to lowest heat setting after soup was thick enough in order to not over cook/toughen the lobster. Thank you for the great start to a perfect lobster bisque.

The soup winds up white in color and bland in flavor with an aftertaste of disappointment. I'm cringing as I type this thinking about wasting all of that precious (and expensive) lobster meat in this abomination. It's borderline inedible, it's that bad. It in no way resembles actual lobster bisque (which is not white, BTW). I will not make this again, nor will I be fooled in the future by AllRecipe's apparently arbitrary star-rating system. 

Truly horrible.

I really liked this bisque but it would be so much better with some garlic. After watching the video I went with the suggested changes of 2 T of flour and butter, I cut the recipe back to 2 portions as I only had 8 oz of lobster.  I added the full cup of chicken broth to a small pot and added the onion and shells from the lobster and let that simmer for a 1/2 hour. I then strained the liquid into a bowl. I'll probably make this again but not often as it is very rich. Thanks for sharing. #Allrecipesallstarscanada

My first time making Lobster Bisque.  I followed the tip on the video and increased the butter and Worcestershire.  The creamy broth was fabulous.  Add the pinch of fresh parsley before serving.  My kids approved and my Husband Loved!!

This was good but here is what I did to make for my wife who has celiac and is lactose intolerant. For gluten free it is as simple as using GF flower and almond milk. We also did not have cayenne pepper so I used crush red pepper,  it was delicious!

This was so good! I was a bit nervous because I had to add a boy more flour at one point to thicken it up. But I just turned up the heat and it melted in. I didn't add cream due to the fat content. I was trying to keep it controlled. There is a good amount of butter in this and I had to add more in the end since I skipped the cream. I used crab and shrimp instead of lobster. Turned out great.

I steamed the lobster for 8 minutes and diced it. I added 1 c of corn because There wasn't much lobster meat from the 3 I steamed.  Next time I'll dice the onion and simmer about 5 minutes until it's soft. I also added another tsp of salt and 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  I'd give it 5 stars  but it needed to be thicker. Next time I'll double the flour and use 1 c milk and 1 c half and half.

This is a FABULOUS dish, but I followed Katie's suggestions with using shallots, half&half, heavy cream, adding more Cayenne, and tomato puree. The tomato puree is what really sealed the deal for me!

We had guest over last night and to start the dinner off we had lobster bisque.  Everyone thought I catered it in, it was so good.   I will do this again. Thank you.

Awesome!!!  I followed the video tips of 4 tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup flour, 2 teaspoons worsteshire sauce, and a teaspoon of sherry. I followed the advice of another reviewer, and added a small amount of tomato paste.  I also replaced 1/4 cup of milk with Half & Half.  It was so easy compared to other lobster bisque recipes.  Those other recipes were all difficult, and not worth the effort.  This is the taste for which I was looking.  Amazingly delicious!!!

I made this lobster bisque for my boyfriend and I and I thought it was bland.  

I followed the recipe, but I used Half & Half and it desperately needed a splash of sherry and a little paprika.

It tasted better with my adjustments, but it was a broth... not a chowder.  Next time I'll use Heavy Cream and more flour.  (to make it thicker)

Thank you.  It was very easy to follow.  Can't wait to make again.

Just made this for my wife and I, really easy to make and tastes great, added diced portabella mushrooms and sauted with onions and broth, sauted the lobster in butter and added to the rue. Great recipe.

this was super easy and the quickest/easiest bisque I've ever made but I had a lot of substitutions.  1) Seafood broth for chicken, 2) more onion, I used a whole one 3) Tomato paste for Flour, also adds pink 4) added sherry to taste, 5) used 1/2 and 1/2 6) used small lobster langoustinos find at Trader Joes and blended in about a 1/3 of broth to make it thicker/creamier, left.  I doubled recipe for a party and got rave reviews from everyone!  I think the suggestion to add garlic is also good.

This recipe was tasty but it seemed a little bland.  As suggested by other reviews, I punched it up a notch by adding a little garlic, black pepper, and a tad bit more cayenne pepper.  Instead of two cups of milk, I substituted one cup with heavy cream. I also added 3 Tblsp of tomato puree.  I definitely would make again though.

Very very good.  I skipped the cayenne because Mom is very heat sensitive, and used Old Bay  instead.  I thought it still needed a little extra something so I added extra Worcestershire, garlic powder, black pepper, and a dash of sherry.  This really made it great.   Anything like crab, langoustine, shrimp would also work great with this.

I did not try this as written but used m in miami's suggestions about cream, tomato, cyanne, etc and turned out great. Tip: if using immiation meat puree it first with milk if you like bisque texture.

I made this soup as a shrimp bisque last night for the 2nd time. Took the suggestions of more cayenne pepper, more worcestershire sauce (1Tb, then check near the end), more flour. Instead of chicken stock, we had the shrimp shells boiled in water and used that liquid. I had some fresh rosemary on hand so crushed it and threw it in but it was good the 1st time without that even.

With the 2 slightly heaped Tb of flour I had in, the soup was a good thickness even with the 2 cups of low fat milk (trying to be more healthy). Accidentally had put too much cayenne in but my younger brother said the soup was addictive. I didn't feel like drinking wine but if I had a bottle already open, I would have added a splash in for even better flavour.

Threw the shrimps in raw, and only simmered it for about 45mins coz of the time.

This recipe was fabulous!!  I did as previously suggested, I used 1 1/2 cup heavy cream and the rest milk and also used more flour.  I also added garlic, and a little more Worcestershire sauce.  I loved the leftovers and am definitely going to make this recipe alot.  I can't wait to see what it tastes like with fresh seafood!!

This was great, but I substituted heavy cream for the milk.  It made it smoother more like the version from my favorite french restaurant.

Middle of the road! Of course I am comparing against my to favorite restaurant stops for bisque! I dunno what all the hype is here!My wife says it really doesnt taste like any bisque she has had but does claim that she likes the flavor "it's different"
