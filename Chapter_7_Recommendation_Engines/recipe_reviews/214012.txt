I read through the reviews very carefully before making this, which I think was my first mistake. I usually don't do that and fly by the seat of my shorts. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some for busy mornings, added more baking powder for a fluffier pancake, doubled the spices and added nutmeg and allspice and I cut the water down to two cups, as a lot of people mentioned that the batter was way too wet. My pancakes were pretty thick and fluffy but they were a pain to cook. The spices I doubled and added were perfect, it's just that maybe cutting back the liquid to two cups was too much? Next time, I'll cut it back only a half cup and I think it might be perfect. It really does need the extra baking powder for a fluffier pancake. That being said, tasty pancake. Even with my flub-up's, this recipe made 15 large pancakes when doubled. Out of the 15, I had three leftover. My boys loved them. I had a small bite of one and thought it was mighty tasty. My son actually remarked that "these are the best pancakes EVER, Mom".

Very good recipe. I didn't have molasses, so I substituted it with 3 Tbsp  firmly packed brown sugar. My husband loved it!

Delicious gingerbread taste.  Smelled and tasted amazing.  The only reason that this is not a 5 star recipe is because they came out a little flat.  I like my pancakes a little fluffier.  I'll keep the spices, vanilla and molasses and try to alter the recipe for a fluffier result next time.  Will definitely keep working on this recipe though, because it was a hit with my ginger-living husband!

I did this the lazy way by using a cup and a half of pancake mix and then adding the recommended amount of spices, molasses and vanilla then just adding water until it reached my preferred consistency. Delicious! 

If you have pancake mix save yourself the trouble of mixing the dry ingredients and just use that instead. Doing it this way will also fix the problems that some reviewers were having with the pancakes not being fluffy or thick enough... If it's too thin just add a little more pancake mix - too thick? Add a little more water. Enjoy!

Followed recipe exactly. Batter is way too thin, and the pancakes are very thin too. Sorry, though the taste is good, the pancakes look awful.

Mmm, delicious!  Thanks CKincaid1!  The flavor was exactly what we'd hoped for.  We reduced the water to 1 c. and I wish we hadn't.  They were a little too thick.  Excellent with whipped cream, maple syrup, bananas and strawberries.  Or by themselves!

I don't think this was a bad recipe. I think this comes down to personal taste. I was not a fan of these pancakes. It was nice to try something new, but this was not for me. The texture was perfect.

I have never had gingerbread pancakes before but these were pretty good. After cooking the first one, my son and I decided they weren't spicy enough for our taste. We added extra cinnamon and ginger. I would do 1 tsp. ginger and 2 tsp. cinnamon next time. We also don't like syrup so added about 1/3 cup granulated sugar after tasting the first one. They were good but I had some trouble with them sticking to my pan.I normally don't have that problem.  We topped with whipped cream and they were yummy.

Pretty tasty alternative to regular pancakes. Based on other reviews, I increased the baking powder by 1/2 tsp and used only 1 cup of water. My pancakes were thick and fluffy. I also used whole wheat flour. They weren't very sweet, but had a nice spicy flavour. They'd be really good with apple sauce. Also, for some reason they seemed a bit more delicate than regular pancakes, so I had to be quite careful when flipping them.

These were tasty and fun to eat.  I used my own wheat free pancake recipe but added molasses and ground ginger.  They turned out very fluffy, almost cake like and yummy.  Next time I'll use fresh ginger an i bet they'll be even better.  thanks

I agree with most of the reviews that you will need to increase amount of the cinnamon and ginger for flavor.  After my batter was ready, I tasted and it was still missing that great gingerbread flavor I was looking for.  Then the light turned on in my head, :) and I went straight to the pantry and grabbed one large piece (depending on how strong you want the ginger flavor, can add more or less) of crystallized ginger, chopped it up into small pieces and mixed in the batter, made the pancakes and there it was!  Whala! Hummm so amazingly delicious!!! Now THAT made it 5 star! :)

I really liked the idea of these.  We LOVE gingerbread at our house.  I read the reviews and used heaping measuring spoons of the spices.  I also reduced the water by 1/4 cup and added more baking powder.  They tasted good, but were really thin.  I will try them again usin gonly 1 cup of water and see if that helps.

These taste more like plain molasses pancakes than 'gingerbread'. I would reduce the molasses to just a couple of tablespoons next time. They were still pretty good with maple syrup and vanilla ice cream though.

I was very excited about this recipe and enjoyed the pancakes a lot during the holiday season.  I am a fan of a thin, crepe like pancake so these were right on target for me on texture and fluff.  I thought that the gingerbread taste was mild, so like some other reviewers I think I would adjust some of the spices in the future.  Overall they were delicious and the family ate them up.

They make the house smell nice though which is why they get 1 star.

These were very good but if you want to make them a five out of five, add a little more salt and replace 1 cup of water with 1 cup of buttermilk. I promise you, these will be even better!

Made for Christmas breakfast.  Doubled the spice, added some nutmeg and allspice.  Added more baking sode to increase fluffiness as the previous reviewers stated (thank goodness!!).  They ended up nice and fluffy, though they were still somewhat dense. I was disappointed in the flavor - I wanted something more pungently cookie-like.  It was a nice twist, but didn't live up to my expectations.

I love these pancakes!  I made a small mistake when I first made them and added 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of baking soda....but, the pancakes turned out great and fluffy.  Thanks so much!

Very good. Made 2 changes; I didn't have any vanilla extract, so I omitted and I used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour. Love it! It's delicious!

Good, but the batter did not rise well.  Doubled spices, extra tsp baking powder and 1/4 less water. Try with even less water next.

My son has a lot of allergies so I used a rice flour mix and flax seed as an egg substitute. I usually make buttermilk pancakes so I used 1 cup of soy milk for the water; it was rather thick so I added about another cup of water to thin it out. I admittedly (and a little ashamedly) forgot to add the molasses/brown sugar because making the substitutes distracted me, so my husband didn't enjoy it so much, but my son ate all on his plate, and that is a huge accomplishment, so I will definitely try these again. It's been difficult for us to find a bread-like product that my son will eat that is allergen-free, so finding this recipe has been such a blessing to us.

Good recipe but needed a few minor adjustments.  I upped the amount of flour to 2 cups, added more spices (1 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp ground cloves and 1 tsp of vanilla).  I also used 1% milk instead of water.  Turned out great!  Not to thin or thick.

Delicious! I followed recipe other than adding some extra of the spices and topping with some toasted nuts. I would recommend using real maple syrup, agave nectar, or top with fresh whipped cream for a more decadent pancake. My fiance awoke to spicy, warm, and comforting smells. He loved them!

What a great idea!  2 of my favorites - gingerbread and pancakes.  I loved these pancakes, but I have given 4 stars as I wish they were fluffier.  Mine also turned out darker than the photos others have posted.  It may have something to do with the type of molasses I used.  Not sure.

It had a good flavor, but being a  I am a huge spice person I added spices..  It was, like some of the reviewers said, needing more soda or powder which I added, but they were still a bit chewy.  If you add that plus a little flour (or reduce the water), they are a tasty breakfast treat!

Loved them! I made them GF with the GF flour blend and added just a bit more baking powder to add fluffiness per other reviewers. Yummy!* Update, I made them regular this morning and I agree with other reviewers...up the spice, cut back a bit on the water and up the bp. So good~

They were good with maple syrup and cool whip on top.  Next time I would add a little bit of sugar to the mix and they would be good plain.

Great recipe....I took other reviewers suggestions and doubled most of the spices, I also increased the baking soda to make them more fluffy. Oh, and I also decreased the liquid a bit, and even tried one batch using soy milk nog.....it was super yummy! I would certainly make these again, especially with the molasses!

Thank you!  What a unique recipe.  It's nice to have a pancake recipe without milk!  I got 18 VERY small pancakes out of this.  I made the recipe as written except I doubled the baking powder and soda, as another reviewer suggested, so the pancakes wouldn't be so thin, and I doubled the ginger and cinnamon.

These pancakes had a good flavor, but turned out pretty thin.  I think next time I'd cut down on the water, since we like our pancakes a little thicker.  But they're really good with whipped cream!

Make sure you don't over mix the batter, or the pancakes will be flat and rubbery.
The first time I made this, it was a flop, but it was my own fault. I definitely read in too much of the reviews.
 
When I made this again, I reduced the water to just one cup, and instead of baking soda, I added another teaspoon of baking powder. I agree that the gingerbread flavor was not very strong, but my kids loved it! I also was out of molasses, so I subbed maple syrup (maybe why the flavor was milder?)Would make this again.

After reading some of the reviews, I decreased the ater to 1 1/4 cups.  I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda.  I also had a smidgen of cloves.  The pancakes turned out light and fluffy.  However, the gingerbread flavor was a it lacking.  Next time I will increase the spice amount and add a couple tablespoons of brown sugar.

These were okay.  I do like less fluffy pancakes so the texture was good but the flavor was too weak.  I am still looking/experimenting.

The taste and smell of these pancakes was wonderful; like a breakfast kiss of the approaching holiday season. The aroma drifted upstairs, prompting my pre-schooler to declare, at 7 a.m., that it was "cookie time!" My only qualm w/ the recipe was that the pancakes were flat, and I prefer a fluffier texture - hot off the griddle w/ a pat of butter (no syrup necessary!), the taste was; however, fabulous.

Definitely needs more baking powder.  Was disappointed in the lack of fluffiness in the pancake but maybe that's the way they're suppose to be.  Will try again using more baking powder & molasses instead of the brown sugar recommended by another reviewer.

Terrible. Followed the recipe to the letter until I was left with a way too runny bowl of goop. Added probably another cup of flour. Ended up with little flavor and bad texture.

I have made this recipe many times over the past few years and it comes out better with the following modifications: 2 tsp baking powder, double the amount of the spices and add 1/4 tsp cloves, cut back to 1 cup or 1 1/4 cup of water depending on how thick you like your pancakes, and make sure you grease the pan every one to two pancakes otherwise the stick very bad. This will give you fluffier pancakes that actually have a decent but not overwhelming amount of flavor.

I've made these many times now, and it CAN be a really good recipe.  But this version includes so much water that the pancakes become wafer-thin and it takes forever to cook all the batter.  Cut the water to 1 cup, then look at your batter and see if it really needs any more.  I've played around with the proportions, and 1 cup of water works perfectly for me.  Also great with berries or fruit chunks mixed in.

READ THROUGH THE OTHER REVIEWS BEFORE MAKING THIS RECIPE! As a base, it's a decent recipe, but like many have said, it is way too thin. I added less water, more flour, 2 TB brown sugar, and an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. Were I to make it again, I'd add more ginger too. But after all those tweaks, the pancakes were great.

If you like gingerbread, you'll like these pancakes. But you must cut down on the liquid. I used 1 cup of milk (rather than water, for a richer taste), and the batter was still very loose but the final pancakes were nice and fluffy. I didn't have quite enough molasses so I subbed some brown sugar for the remaining molasses. I also added a dash of nutmeg. The smell of these cooking was amazing but the actual pancakes were a bit bland. Still worth making.

I used this recipe for the gingerbread flavor, but adapted the Fluffy Pancakes recipe as my base. 

I made them this morning for Christmas brunch and they came out AMAZING!

I made these for Christmas breakfast this morning. I'm thankful I read the reviews beforehand. I reduced the water by 1/4 cup and the consistency and fluffiness was perfect!! I also added a pinch of nutmeg, but couldn't actually taste it anyway. Next time, I will keep the water deduction the same and add 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. A great starting point for a recipe, but given four stars for the excess water.

If you let the batter set up a few minutes, it's still thin but finishes better. Like others I added 2ish T of sugar and 1/2 t more powder. Next time I'll increase spices and reduce molasses a touch. Thanks!

The batter was very thin so I added a 1/2 cup of flour and a 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  The pancakes turned out very well.  They tasted good and smelled wonderful.

I made this recipe as directed, but used generous measurements for the ginger and cinnamon.  (And I'm glad I did).  Wow! Amazing pancakes! They turned out light and fluffy.  Not sweet at all so they pair perfectly with lots of yummy whipped cream and syrup! I've had the recipe saved for a while and now I'm regretting not trying them sooner.  I will make these over and over again.  My toddler is chowing down as I type this.

These are delicious and always make the house smell so wonderful!  A go to for cold mornings that take almost no time to whip up and have a rich flavor.  I've serverd these with maple syrup or with a bourbon glaze sauce and both were fantastic.

I added allspice and nutmeg, as well as doubled the other spices which made it really tasty. The only thing I didn't like was the texture. It was chewy. Any suggestions on how to change that so it's more like a normal pancake?

Very bland. Followed the seasonings exactly. Added less water because it was already quite thin with 1/2 cup to go. Dense and tasteless. Will not make again.

Really played with increasing the spices and added the water to the batter slowly until I reached the consistency I wanted.  They were awesome and so fluffy!!!  Thanks Grammie!!!

made the big soft gingerbread cookies this Christmas and loved them...got me into gingerbread so I thought I would make these for the kidlets.  Followed recipe to the tee and we did not love these pancakes.  Really strong molasses flavour and the consistency is really not like a regular pancake, more like a cake. We love big fluffy pancakes so might just try our regular pancake recipe and add some ginger and cinnamon next year.

I am eating the last of my first batch of these pancakes as I type. I made a single batch exactly as directed. Not bad! They are a thin pancake, almost a crepe, but the flavor is wonderful (as is the smell as they cook), served with plain ol' pancake syrup on top and cheesy scrambled eggs on the side. I will probably experiment to fluff them up a little bit next time (less water? more baking powder?), but my husband said there is nothing wrong with a thin pancake and my children all loved them.

These are my absolute favorite pancakes.... they are perfect with only a slight drizzle of syrup.. and plain. I always double the recipe, add a couple table spoons of brown sugar, and increase the baking powder by 1/2 teaspoon. we turn it into a gingerbread day and munch on them plain ALL day long. My daughters love them :D

Made these this morning. I thought they were bland. Only alteration I made was that since I did not have any molasses I substituted with brown sugar.  I was hoping they would taste more like a gingerbread cookie. My almost 4 year old did not like them and requested his normal bowl of oatmeal for breakfast.

Really good, but I think the ginger was a little strong for my kids.  Husband and I enjoyed them more than the kids.  Batter turned out great and they cooked evenly.

Sorry, but I wasn't a fan of these... I made them for my daughter and I and they just seemed a little bland for what I would want a gingerbread pancake to taste like. Nice concept but I would have added many more spices and a little more molasses to make them better.

I have made these twice so far, the first following the directions completely. They were delicious, though needed more spice.  The second time I doubled the spices, baking powder (as I like thicker pancakes) and another spoonful of flour! They turned out wonderful, smells like Christmas in the house. My 6 yr old LOVES them!   On a side note, I think some butter and cinnamon & sugar are better with it then syrup. Good luck!

Yummy!  Because there is no oil in the recipe, make sure to use nonstick spray on the griddle as the recipe suggests.  I served with warm cinnamon pears (just microwave sliced pears sprinkled with cinnamon for about 2 1/2 or 3 minutes) and maple syrup.  Delicious!

I really wanted to like these but it just didn't happen, I followed the recipe as stated and found the pancakes to be very thin with not much in the way of flavor. Maybe with some tweaking I will try again.

Disclaimer: My review is based on an altered recipe. I subbed half whole-wheat flour and used cold brewed coffee and milk to replace part of the water. The batter was too thin--and I typically prefer thin batter--so I added quick oats to thicken. These tasted good, but I wanted more spice flavor. I might double the spices next time and add a touch of oil or melted butter.

I used pumpkin pie spice instead because I didn't have any ginger. I also used a box mix and just added the spice, molasses, and vanilla. These came out great. Served with a blueberry syrup.

These pancakes are delicious! I made them for Christmas morning and the family loved them. After reading the other reviews, I made some changes and they turned out perfect. I doubled the recipe, increased the baking powder to 1 tablespoon and reduced the water by 1/2 cup. Makes the kitchen smell wonderful and is a perfect Christmas breakfast!

I used milk instead of water and decreased the amount to a cup, added 2T melted butter (you really do need fat in pancakes...), added a tablespoon of brown sugar as well.  These were pretty good with my changes, but a work in progress at this point.

Just had this for Christmas breakfast!  Turned out fabulous on the griddle on a gas range.  So easy to make.  I used 1 cup all purpose white flour + 1/2 cup organic whole wheat flour.  Texture was perfect for the griddle.

I gave these four stars only because I feel that the comments and changes that resulted from reading them helped make this such a delicious treat. I cut the water buy a fourth after doubling the recipe and I did and Ace Kos more ginger and cinnamon  As well as baking powder. The trick that was the toughest with these pancakes was juggling the temperature of the pan  so it wasn’t too hot nor too cool. 

 They tend to cook rather quickly and burn fast if you don’t keep a watchful eye on them. Be careful not to overcook. Because of the consistency of the batter, I did not seem to have a problem with   Call cooked on the outside Ross bites on the inside and as long as I balanced. The pay off was AMAZING! Very tasty pancakes! I only wish we had the time to make gingerbread men out of them as we had planned. They would be adorable.

I do have to say that I enjoy a little more salt in the batter to balance the suite. That might come though, from salted butter if you use it. We presented ours with powdered sugar sprinkled on top and it made for A beautifully festive plate to bring to a potluck. Not sure how well the pancakes held up to the rewarm but they were already to mini quiche being offered up by other people. LOL this would be a wonderful Christmas time treat for kids.

Before preparing these, I read the reviews. Many were saying that the mix was too watery and the pancakes were too thin. I used 1 cup of water instead of a cup and a half and the pancakes turned out great and fluffy.

The first time I made this I followed the instructions and used the 1.5 cups of water and the pancakes were very thin almost like crepes. The second time I used just over a cup of water and they were fluffy and amazing. My two girls loved them.

These came out pretty good but a bit flat. To fluff them up next time I'm going to use a little more baking powder. They have a very good ginger bread flavor.

Not super fluffy, but I chalk that up to the molasses, so that's hard to help. In any case, they are easy and totally delicious!

Added about an 1/8 cup of brown sugar just for a little sweetness. 
Also subbed half the water for whole milk, and only added about 1 1/4 cup to batter til it reached my desired consistentsy.

I doubled the baking soda and reduced the water to 1 cup like some other reviewers suggested.  They were not too thin at all.  In fact, they were a little too dense and I may change that if I made them again.
I also doubled the ginger, extra cinnamon and a few different additional spices.
They were just okay.  They were a little dense and smelled much better than they tasted.  The taste wasn't bad, it was just very subtle.

Don't know what I did differently than others, but I followed the recipe and these pancakes turned out light, fluffy and oh so yummy! I thought the batter was a bit thin, but they turned out perfect. I used medium to medium high heat, it took a bit longer to cook, but like I said they turned out perfectly! I've been looking for a recipe like this for years and finally decided to try this one, I just love them!

Cooked exactly as is and found the recipe to be too light on gingerbread flavor and the texture to be a little rubbery. I can’t help but wonder if it is because lack of fat...many pancake recipes call for a couple tablespoons of butter or oil, and also milk. I think if I try these again I’ll use milk instead of water, add a bit more baking soda, and increase each spice by half a tsp.

I really dislike it when people change a recipe and then give it a review as if they made it as written. That being said,...guilty as charged, but I didn't change the flavor profile just the structural issues.  The ingredients and amounts didn't look right to me, which was confirmed with what I read in the reviews. So what I did was eliminated the baking soda (activates with acidic ingredients, none present), upped the baking powder to 3tsp (fixed the "flat pancake complaint) reduced the total liquid from 1+3/4 ( 1 1/2 water 1/4molasses ) to 1+1/2  (1 1/4 water 1/4molasses) to fix the runny batter issue.

To make theses vegan I substituted the egg for 1 tbsp ground flax seed and 3 tbsp water.  Let sit for a few minutes to thicken up.  I was hesitant to add the 1 1/2 cups water, so I started with 1 cup.  The first batch were really thick so I added the remaining water and made sure the pancakes were thinner.  Absolutely delicious!   serve with maple syrup.  Ensure you use non-GMO products, to make this 'truly' vegan.  Thank your grandmother for me!

I used pancake mix. Doubled the spices as suggested and whisked them into the dry mix.
For the liquid amount I measured the molasses and then add the other liquid to equal the amount in the directions. This had a very subtle favor that was great with sliced bananas and cool whip. I will make this again. I served this with ham slices.

I used milk instead of water. Pancakes came out good, but on the flat side not fluffy like the picture. I would reduce the milk next time and increase the baking powder.

These turned out very well. I would have liked them to be a little fluffier, so will take some of the reviewers suggestions on increasing baking powder. To us, the flavor was perfect.

I made it! I followed the tips from others about reducing the water and additional baking powder. It made a nice, thick cake, I wouldn’t say fluffy, but not flat. I used gluten free powder. Tasted great! Family loved it! Success! It was an easy recipe. Will try the nutmeg suggestion next!

I looked at the reviews and looked at some of the pictures. I ended up following the recipe, except for the water. I used 1 1/4 cup of water. I don't use oil because I use a non stick griddle. To measure out I used a 1/3 cup measuring cup so they would all be the same size. With this recipe, I made 11 pancakes. When I make pancakes I hate runny batter and I hate a doughy batter as well, so with that in mind I used a small spatula to slightly spread them.

Although these are good, I think I will use my own pancake recipe and use the spices and molasses. I like fluffier pancakes. You can definitely taste the molasses but not much more.

I made this according to the recipe, but like other reviewers, I found the batter to be too thin. I added about 4 heaping tablespoons of flour to the batter to thicken it up. This helped a lot. The flavor was great, but I will decrease the amount of water by about 1/2 cup if I make them again.

I agree with many of the reviewers who doctored this recipe that it can be a 4-5 star recipe based on taste. But as written here, these just are not pancakes. Far too much water; I almost wonder if the volume of water was a typo? For those who want a gingerbread pancake, I recommend reading through the comments to pick up some very helpful tips to doctor this recipe (esp less water, more baking powder).

These were okay. Maybe it was the minor adjustments that I made that caused them to turn out "okay" instead of "fantastic". I added an extra 1/2 tsp of baking powder because my kids like fluffy pancakes  and I only used 1 cup of water since the consistency after 1 cup was how I like it.  The flavor is good- next time I think I'll double the spices because we like a lot of flavor.  The issue I have with my version of this recipe is that they are very chewy- probably the chewiest pancake that I have ever had. As I said before that chewiness may be because of user error.

I thought it turned out really well. I substituted fresh ginger for dry, ground ginger. I also put some whipped cream on top when I served it. I didn't have any trouble with them being too runny. That is probably because I live in a desert and the flour seems to be drying here and take extra moisture anyway.

I followed the recipe except I used two teaspoons of baking powder to lighten them up and 1-1/4 cups milk to make them a little thicker.  Everyone liked them, but there wasn't nearly enough ginger taste to actually call them "gingerbread" pancakes.  I'll double that up next time.

Great flavor, but I agree with many reviews. The batter was too runny, and it needed less molasses and more spices.

I had to add about 1/2 cup more flour so they weren't so runny, and they turned out fabulous.  I also used fresh ginger (which I just happened to have - no idea why I bought it at the store this week) so I grated it in. I was surprised at how much flavor this added.  I have 6 kids  ages 10-16 and with their picky pallets I wasn't sure, but  they all ate them up.  I also used 1/2 whole grain flour and 1/2 white unbleached - of course to try to make them a little healthier =).

So I made the recipe as directed and it was too watered down. If you wanted crepes, then leave it thin. I wanted a little more thickness so I added 1 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp more of baking powder. Came out great and they are delicious!

I used 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of condensed milk.  The pancakes were quite thin, but i like thin pancakes more. 
1 teaspoon of ginger is better than 1/2.

I loved this recipe!! I followed others' suggestions and doubled the spices and the baking powder. The extra baking powder made the pancakes fluffy which is the way I like them. I served it with pork sausages and real maple syrup. Its not something I would make all the time, its more like breakfast 'dessert' but boy was it tasty!

I made this recipe exactly as directed except I used half whole wheat flour. Batter was a bit runny and aside from the pancakes being a bit flat... I thought they were great. I REALLY appreciate that this recipe uses molasses as the sweetener so no extra sugar needed and a bit of extra iron from the molasses as well. I think next time I will use an egg substitute and make it vegan. Also love that it has no oil. The best part is that my fussy toddler ate them! Overall great recipe but needs fine tuning.

Really good recipe although I did alter it a little bit. I like my pancakes a bit fluffier so I did 2 cups of flour. Since I didn't have ground dried ginger I used ground ginger for 2 tsp instead of a half, I also added 1/4 cup of sugar since there wasn't any in the recipe and I added one bag of chocolate chips.  I can't wait to share this with my friends and family.

I made this eggless as we have an allergy in our house. I used 1c water and 1/2 c orange juice in place of the water. I also used egg replacer in place of egg. My family and extended family ask for these all the time, they can be a bit runny, I just add a tiny bit more flour!

Good basic recipe. My grandmother may have just spoiled me, but I've always believed that pancakes should be able to stand alone, not smothered in syrup. I, like other reviewers, like a fluffy pancake.  So I only used 1 c water. Added 1Tbsp sugar.  Used 2 tsp cinnamon, 2tsp ginger & 1/4 tsp clove, for bite.  For my taste they turned out perfect. Note, since the batter will be thicker, you will need to spread it around a bit on your griddle. Enjoy!

We weren't awed by this recipe, but I also did mess it up a bit.  I added more baking powder as suggested by another reviewer but I also added more baking soda accidently.  Still, this just made it more fluffy than I had planned.  Surprisingly, the spices and molasses didn't add as much flavor as I like.  I will try again to see if it was my mistake that made it bland.  Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out great with a few additions. I added a half cup of old fashioned oats, a few pieces of minced candied ginger, about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans, and about 1/4 cup of chopped gourmet chocolate pieces. They were to die for!

Batter was too thin. Had to add more dry ingredients. Other than that they were great. Very tasty.

A bit too thin. Next time I'll cut back on the water, increase the amount of baking powder and use 3/4 C. of whole wheat flour. I like the fact that this recipe did not call for milk. Delicious. You don't even need maple syrup.

I put 4 stars because we had to make a couple adjustments. Otherwise, these were so good and everyone loved them (even the kids)! I would do 2 tsp of baking powder and 1 cup of milk instead of water. They turn out fluffier.

I really liked these, but had to add some cloves and brown sugar to boost the flavor.  I made these in advance for our Christmas Eve breakfast, and I know my girls will love them.  They're fun to decorate like gingerbread boy faces also--don't use white chocolate chips because they burn, but white sprinkles are adorable.

Simple, easy and tasty! Made exactly as written for this round. Think next time I'd add a bit of nutmeg. But great as is written. My picky and unadventurous eater asked for seconds!

Made these for breakfast this morning....they were pretty good! Didn't have any molasses on hand so I used brown sugar as another reviewer suggested. Really think molasses will make this a 5 star recipe for me. My husband who isn't a big fan of ginger thought they were good and my 15 month old gobbled up 2 whole pancakes by herself and came back for more! (We had to cut her off!) All in all, I think this recipe is a keeper and will become a staple in our house every Fall and Winter.

This recipe was a nice change. Great flavour! I did double the recipe and added 1/2 cup of ground flax seed for fibre in place of some of the flour, as well I only used 2 cups of water and double the amount of baking powder. Turned out perfect. Thank's to the reviews, I used some of there suggestions. We served them with maple surup and real whipped cream. Kids loved them!

I used pancake mix for most of the ingredients, then added in the extra stuff. Turned out very well! Will make them again. I took the suggestion and doubled the spices - good idea.

My family loved these!  I doubled the recipe because there were 5 of us eating them for dinner.  In doubling the recipe, though, I did not double the amount of water because I thought the mix would be too thin.  I simply added water until I thought the mix was the right consistency.  I have already been told that these better be added to the regular rotation!

Tasted like gingerbread, we added strawberries and cool whip on top and my kids loved it.
