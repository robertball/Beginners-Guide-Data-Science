This tasted like a granola bar, not Baby Ruth... but still good. The oats were kind of crumbly so I might suggest adding 1/2 cup butter to the recipe. Also, there was barely enough chocolate/peanut butter mixture to cover the bars. I might change it to 1 1/2c chocolate and 3/4c peanut butter since there didn't seem to be that much peanut butter once all combined.

something is wrong with this recipe. there is not enough butter or your missing an ingredient in the crust. One stick (1/2 cup) of butter is not enough to keep this crust from crumbling. I had to mix everything together over low  heat, add chocolate chips and make 'drop' cookies out of these to save bake sale. i won't be making these again.

This recipe needs to be reviewed to determine whether there is an ingredient that is missing or a quantity misstated.  The butter/oatmeal mixture does not form a base that can be cut.  I added an extra stick of butter to this recipe, and still ended up with a pile of oatmeal crumbs underneath a chocolate layer.  While my kids enjoyed eating it with ice cream, it was not even close to a bar.

Delicious - After reading some other reviews, I made the following changes: doubled the butter for the crust, used 1/2 c. peanut butter and added 1/4 c. agave syrup.  I also substituted baker's semi-sweet chocolate for the chocolate chips.  Overall it turned out very well.
