3.31.16  We’re about mid-range on spicy foods, and I knew that the amount of red pepper flakes in this recipe would totally overpower everything.  Almost makes me wonder if that’s a typo?  I scaled this recipe down to 3 servings, and it then called for 1 Tbsp of red pepper flakes.  I used 1/2 tsp, and still got the kick.  Cauliflower is very mild in flavor, and unless you adjust the red pepper flakes in this recipe, I suspect all you’ll taste is the “heat” and not the cauliflower or the cheese.  I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave on high for 2 minutes, used Italian panko crumbs, and was quite happy with the way this ultimately turned out.

Definitely a keeper! We are trying to reduce starches in our diet, and this is a good substitute for a potato side dish. I left off the panko topping to keep the carbs down. I plan to try adding bacon and chives the next time around!

As others have noted, way too much red pepper flake. I used less than half the amount called for and it was still too much. The onion is also overpowering and the sauce doesn't really get liquid or cheesy enough.

Consistency not as nice as I would prefer, but suspect that is because this sauce has no flour/is not a roux base. I would maybe bump up the cheese next time. I also lightly browned a shallot instead of using onion b/c I thought that may generate a bit more flavor.  I did not use the red pepper flakes because of other reviews. Overall a good base, but you may need to play with ti some.

Like other reviewers, I thought 2 TBls way too much red pepper flakes, but recipe DOES say "or to taste".  I settled on 1/2 tsp as my Mom is 92 and doesn't handle hot spice well. My husband and Mom loved this, me - it was okay. But then, I don't care for mac n cheese!, so its me. We will be making this again as we are all watching our carbs. Its rich and decadent and very easy. Thanks for a recipe we will use often

It was too hot to turn on the oven, so I made it in the microwave. One pot dish was fabulous!

I adjust the recipe to feed four and reduced the hot pepper flakes to 1 tsp.  4 tsp (the recommended amount) would have been flamingly hot. I did make one significant change, switching the sour cream to nonfat greek yogurt (I didn’t have sour cream). I imagine it would be creamier (and delicious) with sour cream, but it was fine with greek yogurt. I think that switch probably was the reason the texture was a little grainy, though. I did sauté the onions briefly before mixing them in.

Do NOT put 2 T of red pepper flakes.  That has to be a typo.  Do put some, maybe start with 1 teaspoon.  I used regular bread crumbs for the top because I didn't have panko.  That would be better, but still, a yummy recipe that my husband actually ate!

enjoyed this recipe very much, however, you should correct the amount of red pepper flakes. two tablespoons is way over board. I reduced the am to 2 tsp and it was still spicy.

Loved it, with the tweaks that some others did. Here's what I did:1. Roasted the cauliflower first 350 F for 30 min, coated with some olive oil and about 1/2 tsp salt.  Made the sauce with 1/2 cup MORE milk and about 3 oz more cheese. 1 tsp dijon, 1/2 tsp paprika - really gave it the zip that many reviews said it was lacking.  Put the sauce on the florets, then back in the oven for about 8 min.  The sauce coated it nicely without being runny or watery.   Hubby and I both had seconds of it just by itself, it was so good.

Wish I'd read the reviews.  I only put in one tbsp. of pepper flakes and even that was a bit too hot.  I'll use less next time.  Other than that it was an easy recipe to make ahead and cook the next day.

Great recipe.  Also suspect the amount of red pepper flakes called for may be a typo.  I left the pepper flakes out and just put them on the table so people can add as much as they like.  Otherwise this is really yummy and one we will make again.

I just left out the red pepper flakes entirely as we really don't like heat. I sprinkled some parmesan on top of the bread crumbs and it was delicious!  Will definitely make again!

Loved it. For red pepper flakes, three packs of the flakes pizza take out gives you is perfect
