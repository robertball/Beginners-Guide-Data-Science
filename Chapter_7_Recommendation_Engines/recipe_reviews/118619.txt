I usually don't make recipes that aren't already reviewed but boy am I glad I made this one. It is simple with ingreds you have on hand and surprisingly very flavorful.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except that I accidentally put the garlic powder into the egg/shrimp mixture which actually turned out to be a GOOD thing...it seemed to add even more depth to the dish. I also used fat free ranch since that is all I had. The directions seem odd to grill for 20 mins then wrap them tightly and flip.  I did EXACTLY what they said and there ended up be a delicious 'sauce' in the bottom of the foil which I poured over the chicken when serving. The only tricky part is sealing up the chicken with toothpicks.  I simply put the shrimp on one side of the butterflied chicken, folded one half over and then 'skewered' the edge of the chicken with toothpicks until fully closed. Try this dish...you'll like it!

This was super simple and quite tasty! Next time though I would do this as a casserole and place the shrimp on top, like an imperial. Will make again.

As is this recipe is pretty good.  I don't know that I like the egg and shallot used in the shrimp filling. I say this for many reasons but namely b/c the egg is going to run out of the shrimp filling before the egg will cook.  I also chose to cook this in the oven, but cranked my oven to 375Â° and cooked it for about 35 minutes.  I chose to chop up the shrimp to make it easier to close the chicken up.  I think I'll make this again, but will tweak it to suit my preferences
