The taste was delicious! I found it came out watery, but I rarely ever measure anything so that might have been just me. To get more of that chai flavor, try boiling it with the milk as well as the water. Then let it cool to about room temp before putting it in the blender with the ice.

I really like this recipe, although not sure if it counts! I followed Amy's suggestion and brewed the tea with the milk and water. I omitted the ice and drank it hot.  Also I used about 1 1/2 Tbsp sugar instead of 2 Tbsp. Good taste, would make again.

This tasted watered down. I even used less water to brew the tea and it was still too runny.
