This is headed in the right direction but is not quite there. I would suggest baking the pizza crust for about 2 minutes in the oven first. Then take it out, top with some fresh mozz. and then back in the oven for the required cook time written on the package. While it's baking you toss some arugula with some balsamic dressing and shaved parmigiano reggiano and when the pizza comes out of the oven you top with this salad. Let it sit for a minute or two and the hot cheese helps the salad stick. Boom, instant fantastic pizza and also good with a little prosciutto added with the salad (not baked.)

Good but I prefer to make my own very thin crust pizza and topped with bagged spring salad mix tossed with a simple balsamic vinegar/olive oil dressing and freshly shaved pecorino/parmesan cheese. Yum. Served this at parties lots of times. Beautiful presentation.

This isn't so much a recipe, more than an idea... What a great idea! Wonder why I never thought of this? Super fast meal, only thing I did different was to put some dressing on the crust first so the salad would "stick" to it better and make this easier to eat. I used Boboli thin crust pizza shell and romaine lettuce blend. This is a good base for a lot of possibilities.

I make this using Pillsbury Pizza Dough crust-make it first.  Then top with bagged spring salad mix tossed with a simple balsamic vinegar/olive oil dressing.  I add halved grape tomatoes, crumbled feta, and sliced olives.  I also add a little parm/romano cheese on top.  Very good!

Simple to make but sloppy to eat, I agree.  I usually leave off the chicken but add some shredded mozzarella for a meatless meal.

Agreed that this more an idea rather than a recipe and one I think that would work best with leftover salad (already mixed with dressing and add-ins) that no one wants to eat but you feel bad throwing away. If you go that route, make sure to use thick crust so it gives the salad a chance to dry out a bit while baking and boom veggie pizza. I think that's what I'll do next time. /as for this time, I didn't realize that you don't bake the pizza but simply have the crust ready. Having used a thin crust the dressing didn't let it crisp up too well. Meh, it was eaten. I used sausage instead of chicken strips.

Very good, but extremely difficult to eat. The salad leaves don't want to stay on the pizza. I added garlic pepper to the chicken to give it some extra zest.
