I love this recipe! The only change I make is, instead of sweet peppers, I use chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, drained. It makes it a completely different dish with a bite!

We thought this was good. The chicken is in need of some spices/breading. Maybe omitting the feta will allow for breading the chicken and still keep it low-cal. I think i would've enjoyed it more as a side w/out the chicken.

I'm giving this a 4 beacuse my I totaly loved it, but my non-exotic-food-eating husband hated it. I loved the flavor, and it was just right for a late dinner with wine and a movie.

Delicious!  Even my kids liked it.  To 'healthify' use whole wheat penne or rotini pasta.  Also skipped the wine and used 1/2 cup chicken broth instead.  Feta cheese optional.  This is definitely on my 'keepr list'.

A little too soupy and on the bland side. I substituted stewed tomatoes for the roasted peppers because I wanted more of a tomato base. Next time I may try  crushed tomatoes. I also added capers. It still seems like it needs something else to spark it up.
