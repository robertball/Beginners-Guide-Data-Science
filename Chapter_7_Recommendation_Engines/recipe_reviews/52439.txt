This was very tasty.  I added some extra chocolate chips to the brownie before baking to add some chunks.

If you have not made this pie yet, YOU ARE REALLY MISSING OUT!" 
I've made this pie twice now and it's hard to decide which one I like best. The first time I served it with Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream, and it was soooooo good! But then, second time I served it with Frozen Vanilla Custard, "OH MY, WHAT A PIE". Go make this pie!

Excellent, fudgey, rich dessert.  Followed recipe to a 'T' and came out great.  Topped with homemade vanilla ice cream.

This is the most outstanding tasting fudgy brownies I have EVER tasted. If you follow the recipe to a "t", you will wind up with a wonderful dessert! I poured the fudge sauce onto the warm brownie pie & it hardened some & tasted marvelous. Yumm! I can't imagine how obscene these brownies are with ice cream--they are the richest choclate dessert ever! this recipe is NOT for the weak. If you like chocolate A LOT make this!!!

I forgot to get all the ingredients for my husband's favorite cake for his birthday, so I had to change my plans in a hurry.  I found this recipe and thought it sounded like something he would enjoy, and I already had all the ingredients, so...HE LOVED IT!!!  I used vanilla frozen yogurt instead of ice cream, and it was still delicious this way.  I'm going to be using the simple recipe for the yummy fudge sauce for other desserts in the future.

Just like the hot fudge brownie delights we'd get at Dairy Queen as kids when we could afford the calories!  Popular desert with the young & old at our house. Great recipe, easy to make!

Totally sinful!!!!  Absolutely amazing, can't pass this dessert up!  Try vanilla bean ice cream.  I've also used peanut butter sauce rather than fudge, as well as a combo of both and it is great every time.  A wonderful, no fail dessert that will draw raves from anyone you serve it to!!

Skip going out to a restaurant for dessert! You can do better at home. I made my husband this for his birthday and he devoured it.  This is a high quality treat that tastes delicious with cookies n' cream ice cream. Yum! Definitely making this for his birthday next year.
