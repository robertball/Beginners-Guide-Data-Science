Fantastic is an understatement! These ribs were AWESOME! I was nervous since this was my first try at short ribs in the oven. Whew, I pulled it off without any troubles! Other than leaving out the celery (personal taste) and baking uncovered for the first hour and half ~ then covering with foil during the last hour and half, I followed the recipe step by step! Thanks so much for the great recipe, Dave! It's nice to find such a *winner*!!

These were great!  I used the crockpot and cooked them for 8hr while at work and they fell off the bone tender.  Wonderful sauce that I will use for other things I am sure!  Super Easy!  Thanks!

Wow Dave!!!

Ummmazing ribs, and we thank you for posting your recipe.  I ended up purchasing a traditional "Jewish" cut of short ribs, called "Flanken", because a lot of meat markets aren't hip to the cut of short ribs that are served in up-scale restaurants these days.  Same rib, just different shape. I made this cold weather dish in the middle of a hot Sherman Oaks, California August, and let me tell you that 3 hungry diners were toasting you tonight.  Falling off the bone tender, saucy, meaty, and just plain yummy ribs, resting on top of mashed potatoes.
Odd, how I can't even rememember what I served for dessert!

Thanks again for posting.

Best to you,
Jeff

This is fail proof! The sauce is perfect, the perfect amount of zip!  I cooked them uncovered for the first 1.5 hours and then covered for the remaining 1.5 hours.  I also had a little sauce left which I used to baste them with after cooking.  Thanks so much!

We did not care for this and ended up throwing the majority out.  The sauce was on the cloying side and had a very strong ketchup flavor.  Sorry.

These were great! I prepared just like the recipe, not altering anything. Very easy and tasty! thanks Dave!

Update 12/09: hadn't made these in years, but I found the recipe the other day so I decided to make them again. I used pork ribs instead of beef, and nixed the celery because I was running out the door. Oh my goodness these were heavenly! The meat just falls off the bone and they are so flavorful. Husband and kids absolutely loved them too! Baked at 325, and covered with foil for the last half of cooking time. Thanks again for this wonderful recipe!

These ribs are fantastic!  Sometimes I run out of lemon juice and use fresh squeezed orange juice instead.  It still turns out just fine.  The flavor of these ribs are just to die for!!!

This was also my first attempt at ribs and it was very simple.  I made these for my boyfriend and I and we both loved them.  I added about 2T. of honey just for a little more sweetness.  I will definately be making these again!  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good for ribs.  If we were big rib eaters we probablly would have given it a 5.

This is an excellent way to prepare beef short ribs abpnd have them come out tender.  Incorrect cooking of short ribs yields very tough ribs so carefully following cooking instructions is a must.  ThanksDave the Chef!

These fell off the bone, so good. Very tender. I seasoned my ribs with S&P and then seared all sides in a dutch oven in two Tbs of vegetable oil. Added Sweet Baby Ray's and threw it all in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Very tasty.

These ribs really are FANTASTIC! The sauce was incredibly flavorful. I love simple, yet scrumptious recipes like this. If you try this recipe, DO NOT change any of the ingredients, try it just as is first. I did change the temperature to 350 and reduced the time to 2 1/2 hours since we had to leave. I refrigerated overnight, skimmed the fat off and reheated.

oh dear .... I'm so sorry, but ... sauce was okay - maybe it was just the shortribs and all that fat (shudder).  So so sorry.

These were very good. I cut the recipe in half - not a wise choice for the sauce ingrediaents.  The time to bake was too long with reduced sauce to cover.  I would make again - hubby enjoyed it!

The meat turned out very tender, but we didn't care for the sauce. It was thin and watery and my son thought it tasted weird, so he covered this in bottled sauce from the fridge instead. I only cooked this 1.5 hrs. due to time limitations and glad I stopped it when I did as they would have been burnt to a crisp if I had left these in the oven for the full 3 hrs!!! I probably won't try this again.

Excellent but a little too sweet for my taste.  I would cut back just a little on the ketchup and brown sugar.  Will definitely make this recipe again!

3 hours was too long - my ribs burnt.  But, I'm still giving this 4 stars because the sauce itself was delicious.  I will use the sauce again - but most likely on chicken instead.  Thanks!

These ribs were great tasting and tender. I adjusted the recipe a little by omitting the lemon juice from the sauce & using boneless Short Ribs. I cut up the celery & onion into small pieces (instead of grating it) as well as green bell pepper. The meat was seasoned well and placed in a shallow glass pan with about 2-3 tablespoons of water. I sprinkled the celery/onion/green bell pepper on top of the ribs then poured the sauce mixture over it (minus the lemon juice). I covered it with foil and baked at 325 degrees F for 3 hours. They turned out very moist and tender. My husband was very pleased so I will definitely make these again.

Great Recipe!!! I made it today & the meat was just falling off the bone. I only made two changes: I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used regular vinegar & I didn't have celery so I just used some celery salt. I covered it with foil & baked for 3 hours. YUM!

I gave it 3 stars because I think they would have tasted great if they hadn't been burned to a crisp. I followed the recipe, layered the ribs in a shallow pan, covered with the sauce and put in the oven. I cooked muffins earlier that day and the oven temp was fine. The ribs weren't just well done, they were black, hardened, charred to nothing. Total loss of some lovely ribs.

This was pretty good. We really loved the sauce it made, but we added about 2 tsps. of worsteshire sauce to make it a little less sweet just because of personal preference. I made it in the slow cooker because we were busy running around all day & I used boneless ribs since that was what I had on hand & they turned out a little dry. Which was probably my own doing so I'll use the right ribs next time. But very good recipe.

The sauce was great and really easy. I changed the cooking method a little but loved the sauce.

I thought this sauce was delicious.  I did add a little honey but otherwise, I left it alone.  It was quick and easy to make.

The flavor of the meat and sauce was really good.  Imade this in a covered clay pot, and the meat literally fell off the bone.  I was not sure how to grate celery without it becoming stringy, so I left most of it out.  Also, I cut back a bit on the ketchup.

This sauce was not good at all, I had prepared it ahead of time and it just taste like catsup, nothing more nothing less! what a waste of time! I was however able to save the ribs. They should take the recipe off the internet!!!!

We absolutely loved this recipe. The sauce smelled just like a home made Worcestershire sauce and tasted like it too. So darn good from the get go. The ribs were so juicy and tender. We just wanted more after every bite. Typically we throw these on the grill after a long marinating period, but this is going to become our new favorite go-to recipe. We paired this dish with the lemon garlic broccoli recipe found here. So delicious. Follow the recipe exactly.

Made as is, temp and timing are perfect. Produced the most tender beef ribs that I have ever eaten. Sauce, was just ok. Next time I will either use a different sauce or cut the ketchup in half, and/or tweak it a bit.

I made this tonight for my husband and daughter. We were all pleased with the flavor. 
I did not use celery as my daughter doesn't like it.  Otherwise I followed the recipe. 
It's a keeper!

I wouldn't call these ribs "fantastic," but I wouldn't call them horrible, either.  I gave them a 3 star--hubby gave them a 4 star.  They were very greasy, but that's just how short ribs are.  I would have liked to eat some of the sauce spooned over them, but there was so much fat in it.  Since there is just the two of us, we will have leftovers tomorrow.  So I put the sauce in the fridge, hoping all the fat will rise and can be skimmed off.  Others reviews about them burning scared me, so I covered them the first half of cooking, then took the cover off for the last half.  They were very tender.  I served them with corn on the cob and cole slaw.  I might make them again.

This was a pretty good recipe. It was easy as well. My family liked this quite a bit and the meat was very tender. One of my sons enjoyed the sauce onteh bones quite well also. I am not sure if everyone knows, but I would att to take the membrane off back of the ribs by the bones. This makes them a bit more tender and also easier to eat.

I used the sauce here as a marinade, let 'er soak in the mix for 24 hours. Slapped on some sweet baby rays hickory and brown sugar bbq every half hour or so, 2.5 hours of oven=30 mins. of ribs ecstasy.

This recipe was amazing . No fuss after putting in oven. Quick prep just put in the oven and leave it.  The marinade/sauce does the rest.  Best ribs I have ever tasted! and my daughter and husband feel the same.

These were wonderful! I added 2 tbls honey and 1 tsp garlic powder.  Instead of grating the onion and celery I chopped them very fine with a hand chopper.

My family just loved this recipe!  I have honestly never made BBQ ribs before without using store-bought BBQ sauce, so for my BBQ-loving husband to rave about it, I think this recipe is tops!! I did add a little Cookies BBQ sauce to it because I had a larger roasting pan and didn't think I had enough sauce, but next time, I will definitely make more of this sauce.  We also reduced the cooking time to 2 1/2 hours, because at that point they were just falling off the bone!!! DEEE-LICOUS!
