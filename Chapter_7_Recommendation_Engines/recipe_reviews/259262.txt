Love acai bowls but they are so expensive to buy so thought I'd try making it. I was able to get the acai pur√©e at Whole Foods and followed recipe except that I added about 1 tsp of honey into the mix. Needed more than 2 Tbs of milk. I used about 3. Then topped with granola, banana, blueberries, strawberries and almond butter. Delicious!

IT tasted good but it had a weird texture on my tongue.
