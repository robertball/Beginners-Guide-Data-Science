I made these cookies twice. The second time, I toasted the coconut first. This made them much better, and more "coconutty". To toast the coconut just spread it on a baking sheet, and bake it at 350 for 5-10 mins, stirring a few times. I also used rice krispies instead of cornflakes the second time, and I liked it much better. Great recipe!

Great cookies, Melissa. I made a batch in compliance with the recipe and agreed with a couple other reviewers that they had a slightly salty taste. The second batch was made eliminating the baking powder and 1/2 the salt, also added toasted walnuts and chocolate chips. Baked at 375degrees for 9 minutes. CRISPY AND DELISH! Just the way my family likes them. Thanks for sharing.

Toast the coconut at 350 degrees for ten minutes prior to putting into the mixture, add a 1/2 cup chocolate chip cookies, and add 1/2 cup more flour - perfection!  The toasting of the coconut really gives it a true coconut flavor.  I was also generous on the vanilla.  Excellent!

I made these cookies leaving out the salt. I arranged them on a air-bake cookie sheet in 1-tsp size rounded balls, then smashed them somewhat 'flat'. I baked on a for 9 minutes at 325 degrees in a convection oven. (375 degrees if non-convection). 

After they had cooled, I melted 1-1/2 cups semi-seet chocolate chips and 3 tbsp shortening. (Double boiler or microwave 1 min or until melted)
I then dipped the cookie 1/2 way, then layed on wax paper to cool. They didn't last very long! You can also use white chocolate chips as an option.

Great cookies.  Great flavour and texture.
I doubled the recipe my first time out and am glad I did.
I followed the recipe as written. 
These cookies spread very little so you can put them much closer than the 2" specified.  
The first batch I shaped as per instructions.  Then I found that the dough was easy to shape into a log for slice-and-bake cookies - although you do need a good sharp knife.
Thanks for the recipe, Melissa J.

These cookies are awesome!!  Even if you don't like coconut you'll love these!  I used rice crispy cereal in place of corn flakes because I was out and they were soooo good!  They really are crispy and chewy!  Thank You!

Yum! This was a real hit with my whole family. I have done some baking in the past but I am not a pro and I made this recipe with ease. I did make a few changes in order to make them a bit healthier...I used 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup melted honey (just mixed in at same time as sugar) I added 1/4 tsp. baking soda (because of honey) and instead of 1/2 cup butter I used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of apple sauce. I then cooked them on a lower temp. (just below 300 F) for 18-20 mins. I will definately try again with more honey and less sugar. Great recipe, thanks a bunch!

Did I just die and go straight to heaven?? These cookies are extremely good. They are truly crispy. The ingredients don't stick together like in other cookie dough, but it melts together during the baking process. I used brazil nuts instead of coconut. I also added dried cranberries instead of raisins. It's going to be another favorite!!! Thanks!!!

Fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. Definately a keeper and will be a frequent addition to our cookie jar. Next time I will try adding chocolate chips for a different variety.

I really wanted to do something different with these cookies, so I cooked them in miniature muffin tins.  I filled them about 3/4 of the way full, and baked them right at 10 minutes.  After they cooled completely, I removed them from the muffin tins and they held their shape perfectly.  I didn't have the coconut or chocolate chips and I really wanted a chocolate taste in these cookies...so I added 2 packets of instant hot chocolate with marshmallows.  I know it sounds funny, but the cookies had a good flavor.  All I had was a packet of raspberry flavored chocolate chips (from Hershey PA) and I wasn't going to open them for this recipe.  I'd be glad to make these again.  Thanks for sharing.

My 5 yr old daughter wanted to make coconut cookies, so we found this recipe and decided to whip up a batch. And are we glad we did, they came out AWESOME! There were a few changes to the original recipe, didn't have cornflakes, subbed Rice Krispys, lightly crushed...and my 5 year old accidentally added another teaspoon of vanilla...she also insisted we toss in some semi-sweet chocolate chips, lol...With my pain in the butt tricky oven, they took about 12 min total for a nice golden brown edge, and are the promised crispy chewy cookie! My hubby is SUPER picky about cookies, and almost always has a critique of my baking, he said these were PERFECT! I give it 5 stars, even with my revisions, because without the original recipe, I'd have had nothing to play with! Thanks Melissa, awesome recipe and I'll be putting a copy in my permanent cookie recipe box.

I toasted 1 1/3 cups of coconut flakes in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes. I also threw in the remainder of the coconut flakes that were left in the 7 ounce Baker's Coconut package. I baked the first batch at 10 minutes because I like my cookies a little chewy. The rest I baked at the full 12 minutes for a more crispier texture. The cookies don't spread out too much.  I ended up with 36 coconut cookies. They hold their round shape nicely. I could see some of the coconut flakes were lightly brown at the edges - nice! I do think toasting the coconut flakes gives this a slight "coconutty" flavor, however it is not necessary and the cookies would be just as good even if this extra step was not taken. The cookie is slightly crispy and when I tried the other batch that was baked the full 12 minutes, I found it the same- slightly crispy only darker in color. I like the texture that the cornflakes adds. The ingredients and directions were approximate. These were definitely chewy, moist and delicious cookies!

I used half butter and half butter flavored Crisco shortening. Had no problems with crumbling... I find that cookie recipes containing all butter ARE crumbly, so it depends on what end result you wish to achieve. Anyway, these were delectable, chewy and crispy as promised. They didn't last but a night in my house! Thanks, Melissa!

These are a great little cookie. It reminded me of a oatmeal cookie with a little more crunch.  This one is a keeper for my recipe box, but I think next time I will make the cookie larger with a chocolate chip, raisin, or butterscotch chip.  To me it needed something more.  Hope that helps!  Happy baking =)

These were great! Chewy at first, they became crisp over time. Great with either texture! I used packed teaspoons & was careful to not overbake. Will make these again.

This is just the recipe I've been looking for.  I used 1/2t almond extract and 1/2t vanilla instead of the 1t vanilla.  And I baked for 9 min in 325 convection oven.  These are great!

Excellent! I've never baked anything this delicious! I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 applesauce instead of 1/2 cup of butter and they came out delicious. However, they were thinner than I hoped for and they spread a lot during baking, so large spoonfuls aren't necessary. They were somewhat hard to get off the pan because they were very sticky and soft when they came out of the oven. They also only took about 7 minutes to cook to a nice brown color. I made a batch with chocolate chips and my brother LOVED them. These are a hit with everyone, I'll definitely be making them again soon. Thank you!

Yum! Only change I made was to reduce the salt to 1/4 tps (per other reviewers). Also, I didn't bother to crush the corn flakes. These are really delicious and so easy to make.

These were pretty tasty.  I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter, and rice krispies instead of corn flakes, and I toasted the coconut on a cookie sheet for 10 mins at 350.    These do flatten out a little, but not bad, and they do have a chewy and crispy component.  Pretty good!

This recipe was great and the cookies are absolutely delicious! I followed the advice given in some other reviews and cut down the salt by about half. I also toasted the coconut to make the flavor a little more prevalent. After ten minutes at 350 degrees these puppies were perfect. Thanks so much for the great idea!

Great recipe!  I cooked each batch only 9 minutes due to burning.  Make sure you store these right away.  I left some out for 40 minutes and they softened up and were not crispy anymore.

I make this recipe all the time!  They are awesome!  I only use 1 cup coconut.  My husband is a cookie monster and one day I took these to work and left only 4 at home.  I thought I was going to divorce court!!!  I told him they were for a potluck at work!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out well.  I'm sure that I will make them again.  That being said, I would recommend waiting until they are cool to eat them because the cornflakes became super chewy giving the impression that each cookie had a piece of wax paper hidden in it...that was a new experience!  Thanks for the recipe.

Once again, an excellent cookie. Crisp on the outside , chewy in the middle. I took another's advice and toasted the coconut. Great! I also made one batch basic, another with a chunk of caramel in the middle, and the last with choclate chips in it. Can't decide which one is best! A winner. Would be great dressed up for the holidays!

These were so yummy! I only had half of the vanilla extract on hand so I used 1/2 almond extract. Coconut almond? Delicious! I think I'll make it that way from now on!

Great cookie! You can adjust this cookie to be more crispy or chewy based on how you measure your dry ingredients. For the standard recipe make sure you level off ALL of your dry  ingredients with a knife for the most exact measurement. If you decide to toast the coconut, only toast 2/3 cup and leave the other 2/3 cup moist. Toasting your coconut will lessen the moisture in the cookie. I also cut back on the oatmeal just slightly. This is perfect with French vanilla ice cream.

This cookie is perfectly cripsy due to the cereal (I used Crispix) and chewy due to the coconut and oatmeal.  I made them because I was looking for a ranger cookie--something my grandmother made me, and this seemed closest to her recipe.  I love this cookie and have been making it for 3 years.

Excellent recipe!  Makes a big, beautiful, chewy cookie!  I added pecans and more oatmeal but not the cereal.  Chocolate chips would be a good addition.  Needs to bake longer.  Overall, it rates 5 stars.

Really good cookie! I wish it would have said to add cinnamon thou. I put it in my last batch and the one's without it don't even compare. I also toasted the coconut as other reviews advice. Also I didn't have any corn flakes so rice krispie's worked just as well.

A big hit!!!  I used frosted flakes instead of corn flakes for extra sweetness. The recipe was big enough to split into three portions, and I added chocolate chips to some, raisins to some, and coconut to the rest.

OMG!!! These cookies are super duper delicious and everyone likes them. I didn't change a thing. Maybe only used around 1,5 cup of grated coconut. Half of it I roasted and another half I left fresh. The coconut flavor is so rich and alluring. Even my mom who doesn't like sweets very much is enamoured of them. The only thing I don't understand is why my cookies are much darker than other users' ones. =S

I did not have the oatmeal and made a couple of other changes based on comments that the cookies were too salty and too sweet.  I only used 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/3 cup each of the sugars.  Made like this the cookies are delicious!  Crispy, chewy, and packed with flavor!

We really liked these (both the first and second time I made them).  I did a lot of tweaking the second time I made them (cut back the amount of sugar, used 1/2 whole-wheat and 1/2 AP flour, used 1/2 light butter and 1/2 applesauce, used Brown Rice Krispies), and will post an custom version of this recipe separately if anyone wants to see it--we liked the altered recipe as much as the original.  My rating is for the original, unaltered recipe.  I pre-toasted the coconut, as per some other reviewers suggestions, and this really made the coconut stand out for us.  The cookies were really sweet, yummy and soft, yet had a neat crunch, as the title of the recipe suggests.

These are really good cookies.  I did find the dough a little dry and I wonder if I used too much cornflake cereal.  I used 1 cup of crushed cornflakes and I wonder if it should be 1 cup of cornflakes crushed.  It didn't really matter too much...still an excellent cookie!

These were really good cookies. I followed the recipe exactly as Melissa said, other than toasting the coconut first...as others suggested.  The texture is the best I have ever had. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they didn't have as much of a coconut flavor as I would have liked. I guess I was just craving coconut tonight! They would be really good with a little chocolate drizzled on them. Maybe add a little coconut extract if you want more coconut flavor.  I will try that next time.

Very good.  Lovely coconut taste, and even though I didn't really crush the cereal, it didn't matter.  I baked as directed and got a nice, soft cookie.  Mine didn't burn or get too hard, so it works for me.  Bf and coworkers gobbled them up.  Thanks for the reicpe!

Been using this recipe for a few years now, but I've always made it a little different. I thought I'd share that difference that turns these cookies from good to great. It's simple enough, just use a whole bag of flaked coconut instead of 1 1/3c. It's a heck of a lot more and your cookies will look much different, but once that butter and sugar caramelizes the coconut you're left with a crunchy, delicious treat that people will ask for over and over again. This makes a spectacular christmas cookie!

Subbed Frosted Flakes as we were out of Corn Flakes. Really exceptional cookie! About the only thing we'd do different is the addition of chocolate to make these off-the-chart delicious!

YUMMY!!! Definitely going to be one of my favorite cookies. You can taste the salt, so adjust to your liking. I cut the amount of salt in half and I thought it was perfect. The only other changes I made was simply the addition of white chocolate chips, as others have suggested, and I did use Rice Crispies instead of cornflakes. I will try toasting the coconut next time just to see if I like it any more than I already do. THX Melissa for the recipe!

The only change is that I add rice krispies instead of corn flakes because we never have corn flakes. I make this cookie all the time and it's my hubby's favourite.

Oh my gosh, these are SO yummy! I just adore coconut cookies and this recipe does not disappoint. I didn't have cornflakes, so I skipped that ingredient, but they were delicious nonetheless. I will definitely be making this again! (And again and again...)

Good! I added a teaspoon of coconut flavoring to punch up the coconut taste a bit. I'm not sure that I love the cornflakes in there, but overall a good cookie. Thanks :)

These were good, I am not sure about the cornflakes, I did crush them but almost felt like they didn't belong.  I will probably make these again and next time I may use coconut extract along with the flaked coconut and add some chocolate chips.

very good! the only change that i made was to reduce the coconut to 1 cup (it just made sense to have them all the same!) i also used a very small ice cream scoop to measure them out, so i got 58 cookies, and they took about 7 minutes to bake. my daughter and her boyfriend just ate the entire first pan right out of the oven (18 cookies!)

Recipe is OK but salty for my taste. The second time I omitted the salt, toasted the coconut as the oven was preheating, and substituted rice crispies because I prefer them to corn flakes and they're not coated in sugar. I used a cookie scoop for uniform size and baking time, plus a Silpat to slide them off. The trick is to take them out of the oven when they're golden brown but not completely done because they'll continue cooking. Perfect. Cookies disappeared in hours, and I don't have children. ;) This is definitely a keeper.

Ohhh YUMMMMM!  When I try a new dish, I like to follow the recipe exactly as written the first time around and then maybe will tweak it when making it again.  That's what I did with these cookies -- followed the recipe exactly.  I have nothing to change, I will save it exactly as it is and will continue to make it this way each time.  The cookies came out crispy and chewy and wonderful.  I wouldn't change a thing!  I didn't get 5 dozen; closer to 3.  Ok, I ate a LITTLE of the dough....and I made the first pan of cookies a little bigger.....  No Matter!  I loved these cookies!

OMG these are soooooooo yummy!!! I just pulled these out of the oven and wow they are awesome! I did use sweetened coconut and added some white chocolate chips. I baked them for 12 minutes on my pampered chef stone and let them sit for about 5-10 min's when I pulled them out. I then transferred them to my cooling rack but of course had to taste one while it was still warm. Very very yummy!!

These cookies taste somewhat like a macaroon and an oatmeal cookie put together and crisped up a bit. Yum!! This recipe is quick, easy, basic, and very adaptable-- adjust to your taste. For instance: I cut the salt a bit, used different types of cereal (honey bunches of oats, smart start, etc.), and once I even replaced the oats with more cereal because I ran out halfway through making the cookies (!)-- with no problems in taste, texture, or appearance. My husband added the coup de grace-- a sprinkling of cinnamon on top of the warm cookies right out of the oven. They were delicious!

Very Good.  I did add pecans - since they grow here in Texas in our backyard and don't cost anything -  My husband and I were very pleased with this recipe.  They also freeze well.  I froze half the recipe and after a few weeks they were still just as yummy as the day they were baked.  Thanks.

Great recipe! These are crisp when you take them out of the oven but the become chewy because of the coconut after cooling. I used rice krispies instead of the cornflakes. Nice cookie for a change without nuts or chocolate chips.

I made these exactly as written---except I toasted the coconut, but the dough was very dry, and unless you flatten the dough balls, they won't flatten out themselves. They taste very good, but are very crispy/crumbly because of the dry batter. I will make them again to try to fix this--maybe another egg or two or more butter?

This recipe makes YUMMY cookies. I followed it exactly as written (with the exception of toasting the coconut and adding some white chocolate chips). The one thing that was surprising was that the cookies had very little coconut flavor...but my coconut was a little old so maybe that's why. Oh well, it's still a keeper!

I did change it slightly because I didn't want a chewy cookie at all I eliminated the baking soda and baking powder. They are absolutely perfect, excellent taste and just the right crispy texture.

Surprisingly good for such a simple recipe.  I chose this one only because it two items in my pantry I wanted to use up:  Corn flake crumbs and coconut.  I suggest that you flatted the drops out a bit before cooking.

These are just too good.  They are juicy from the coconut and buttery tasting.  They do taste better than they look, which is just like a plain old cookie.  A great addition to anyone's recipe collection.  Thank you

I found this to be too salty!  It overpowered the other good ingredients, so it was simply the salt taste you noticed.

I am a huge coconut fan, but my hubby loves chocolate.  So I added 2/3c chocolate chips - they were a huge hit!  I did, however, have to add 2T of water to moisten the batter a bit, though... probably because I live in a very dry climate.  Thanks for the recipe - this one's a keeper!

These cookies came out salty and no one would eat them.  I don't think I'll try again.  If you want to try, you should cut out salt and cut down baking soda.

I have made these cookies several times and have tweaked to too my preference. Everyone loves them. I toasted the coconut as others before me have suggested. I used rice crispy cereal instead of corn flakes. I also added 1/2 cup dried fruit.(Raisins,cranberries, etc.)

I must have measured something incorrectly.  The dough was extremely dry and I had to squeeze it so it would stay together.  The cookies  didn’t spread at all just baked in lumps.  WTS they still tasted amazing and the hubby loved the too.  I will make them again and pay attention to my measurements.

I made the cookies today.  There is not sufficient butter, oil or moisture to hold the cookie.  I formed the cookie dough in small ball and placed on cookie sheet.  Still fell apart.  I baked for 10 minutes and hard.  To remaining cookie dough added liquid coconut oil (about 1/3 cup) This batch was crisp and delicious.  I came to the web site again to review the recipe.  It is exactly the recipe is used to make dough.  The ingredients are excellent but not the cookie imagined!  I added chopped pecans but they fell out of the cookie dough on the sheet.  Something is missing as  I am a frequent cookie maker.

This recipe is just awesome....as is! The only thing I didn't do is to "sift" which I never do and they came out just fine. Living in South Texas for many years gave me my first introduction to and love of, "Ranger Cookies", of which there were many variations, but all very much like this. Having moved further north, these have been a pleasant surprise to friends & loved ones in the Midwest. Thanks so much for posting!

I'm a very good baker but this just didn't turn out as I expected.  First, taste of Baking Soda is too strong (1 tsp is too much!), also it needs to be frozen or refrigerated well before baking otherwise they will just stick to the bottom of baking sheets and make a mess.  I used 1 1/2 cups of shredded coconut.  Not too sweet; Chewy texture. I'll probably try it again with less baking soda a bit more sugar since I like my cookies to be sweeter.

These are always a hit wherever we take them. We use the cinnamon corn flakes and cut back just a little on the white sugar and oatmeal when making, but still yummy.

I was craving coconut cookies and these fit the bill. I used corn Chex as I didn't want to buy a big box of corn flakes just to make cookies, since we don't eat them. The cookies taste a little too "corny", so I'd reduce the corn cereal to a half cup in future.  I used two cups of coconut because I love it!  I bakedas directed, but the cookies browned way too quickly so I reduced the heat for the second tray to 330 and baked 15 minutes. The second tray is still a bit too brown so next time, I'll try baking them even "lower & slower". They're delicious, so I'll keep tweaking till I get it right!

I cut back the sugars to only one cup all together. I added raisins and toasted the coconut as mentioned in other reviews. I also used Rice Krispies instead of corn flakes. We ate them up quickly. Next time I want to add dark chocolate chips. Good one for the books.

My wife likes crisp cookies so I decided to try this recipe.  This is now our favorite cookie.  The only change I made is to substitute Special K with vanilla and almonds for the corn flakes.  My last batch I omitted the coconut and they were delicious.  We live at altitude so I baked them for 20 minutes.

You can't lose with this recipe. I've made them several times. At Christmas, I dipped them half way into a milk chocolate dip. Everyone devoured them. Other times, I've added bittersweet chocolate morsels or raisins. We also love them straight up. They always turn out chewy and crunchy, buttery, coconutty (?)  and delicious.

Best cookies ever.  I leave out the cornflakes and add about a half cup more coconut. I make these throughout the year but more so during the holidays. Even friends who claim to not like coconut LOVE these cookies.

These are really really great cookies, a four star only because I made a few changes based on what is available.  I live in Guatemala, and it can be a challenge to find every ingredient.  I doubled the recipe, and only had about a cup and half of corn flakes, so added in about a cup of sesame seeds for additional crunch and flavor, and won't have any left-overs.  These cookies are light, crispy outside but chewy inside.  I used coconut without sugar, so they weren't too sweet as others suggested.  Great cookies., as always.

The only change I made was to double the recipe and to use honey bunch of oats bc I did not have corn flakes.  Excellent!!! Personally I would not toast the coconut as one review stated.  Perfect as is!  I got 4 dozen plus 4 cookies out of doubling recipe

I used rice krispies in this recipe because I had them and didn't have cornflakes. I do have a recipe for cornflake cookies much like this one and it is very good. The crumbly nature of the dough made it difficult to get the cookies uniform in shape and I think the cookies were a little tough after cooking, but the flavor was delicious. We had no trouble eating them. I do like my other recipe better though.

Great flavor, but strange fluffy muffin texture. Would recommend leaving out the baking soda and toasting the coconut beforehand.

I made these exactly as the recipe was written and they were delicious!  A childhood recipe didn't include the oats and love having them in there. I didn't think the cookies were too salty as I read in other comments...perfect!

Fantastic little cookie. I toasted the coconut as suggested by other bakers, added 1/2 tsp extra vanilla extract and mixed my oats 50/50 quick cooking oats and old fashioned oats. I will be adding raisins next time. Macadamia nuts would be a wonderful addition as well. Will definitely make these again.

this is aa superb cookie recipe. dont get why some of the health nuts make cookies. their reviews are worthless. eat grass clippings if thats your thing. I however followed the instructions except had no corn flakes but better yet had frosted flakes.  I'm not the best baker in the world but i do know my oven (gas) runs hot. placed the trays on the top rack and turned the temp to 325 as was suggested in a review.  12 minutes and they came out top notch.

Very tasty and chewy. Unfortunately, I was also able to taste the baking soda. Next time  I'll use half or no baking soda, but overall, it's delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly the first time that I made it. I did find it to be a little bit too salty. As other reviewers have suggested, I would omit the salt and possibly baking powder from this recipe. I personally also liked that crispiness of the cookies better when left in the oven for 12 minutes as opposed to 10 minutes.

Good basic recipe but cookie dough was a little dry after adding flour, cereal, corn flakes, coconut and oats.  Next time I will increase the butter to 3/4 cup to see if the dough holds together better.  I took one reviewer's suggestion and toasted the coconut first and this may have also added to a somewhat drier batter as I find fresh coconut adds a bit of moisture to the cookie dough.  This recipe is a keeper but definitely needs fine tuning for me.

They taste great but I found the mix a bit too dry. The cookies didn't spread out at all. I would add more butter or shortening next time. I also added less salt based on other reviews and it was enough.

These cookies remind me of my Grandmother.  Those that say they taste a bit "salty" ... I agree, but that is the delight in them!  I make them during harvest, and they really seem to hit the spot with the hard working folk!  I did add raisins and pecans, just to up the calories, but don't really need it!  5 stars all the way!

I made these cookies first exactly as directed, however I found that the cookies where a bit dry after about an hour and the sugar was a bit too much.  I Baked them a second time making a few adjustments, I added a 1/2 cup of coconut oil to the 1/2 cup butter, I substituted gluten free flour to the regular,  I added a 1/2 cup of crushed corn flakes to the recipe and added 1 tsp of coconut extract and the vanilla, I also added chocolate chips and a quarter of a cup of flax seeds.  Everything else I kept the same.  
The cookies remained chewy, and my family loved them.

OMG these are so good. I toasted my coconut and it started to burn at 5 minutes so I took it out.. and the cookies were done at 8 mins in my oven. We have ate them two nights in a row. Crunchy but not hard and great flavor.

Disclaimer:  I did make two changes:  I replaced corn flakes with rice crispy cereal (because that's what I had), and I eliminated the white sugar altogether.

They were ok.  Nothing special.  Plenty sweet (so that wasn't the issue), but just nothing out of the ordinary.

These cookies are awesome. truly crispy and chewy. I have made them using rice krispie cereal in place of the corn flakes as one reviewer did and I actually prefer that. One thing I find is that the batter is fairly dry and it is a challenge to get the cookie shaped into balls sometimes. I wonder if adding additional butter would help and not hinder the recipe. I think I will try that next time.

My best friend made these yummy, crispy cookies and I totally fell in love with them! They remind me of Ranger Cookies. It has the right crispness and the cornflake with the coconut adds extra goodness. Now that it is summer time I look forward to making these myself. I think white chocolate chunks and macadamia nuts would bring these gems to another level of yumminess. Thanks for sharing :)

I've made these several times.  I've followed the recipe and made them with some changes.  They are great both ways.  I made two changes.  I used rice krispies instead of corn flakes, and I added a teaspoon of rum flavoring.  The rum flavor makes them amazingly good.  People at work tell me they're the best cookies they've ever had.

These are really good cookies. They are perfect if you are looking for a crispy oatmeal snack, and the coconut flavor isn't too strong. Thank you for the great recipe!

Great recipe! I may have added too much toasted coconut....b/c it was much too crumbly to hold together...so I added 2 more eggs & an extra stick of butter...probably could have added a bit less butter....but they turned out delicious anyway!!! =)

Amazing! I didn't have the korn flakes or rice crispies so I just added more oats and flour since I doubled the recipe. I also tried someones idea of dipping them in chocolate and I also substituted half the butter for apple sauce as well as toasting the coconut. Wow so good!

LOVED it.  Instead of 1.2 cups of butter i did 1/2 cups of applesauce,  I exchange whole wheat flour with the all purpose flour.  Triva sugar instead of white sugar,  Egg white instead of egg. protein plus corn flakes too!   Still sooooo moist and chewy!  (  beat the applesauce and sugars and egg white until it gets fluffy)

This is the best cookie recipe I've made! I added some chocolate chips to a few per my chocolate loving daughter's request. Personally, I like them without it. Not sure why some said they were too salty. I think this was a perfect combination of ingredients. Crunchy and chewy at the same time! My kids ate these faster than I could bake them.

I told my husband I was making these and he said not to use corn flakes so I doubled the rolled oats. I also substituted 1/2 of the butter with applesauce and used all white sugar (with a little extra). I also halved the salt as we were looking for sweet cookies. These were requested again and eaten right up.

Okay, I made this the first time with revisions. I did give it 5 stars due to the fact that my healthy version tasted so good that the original must, also.
My changes: whole wheat flour for all purpose, Nature's Path Smart Bran cereal for the cornflakes, 1/4 cup Brummell and Brown Yogurt spread and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the butter, 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, 1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes, and added 1/3 cup dark chocolate chips.
I baked for the recommended cooking time and they were perfect. My husband usually hates "healthified" versions of treats, but really likes these. I haven't told him they contain a high fiber cereal...

I had high hopes for these cookies, they were delicious but just a tad bit too salty. I could barely taste the brown sugar and the sugar, I'm thinking maybe it needed a little more sugar...but overall they are tasty!

Simply amazing!  Just a few changes. I used 2 tsp of vanilla instead of one.  Used rice crispies instead of cornflakes. Make sure you use unsweetened coconut!!  Made the mistake of using sweetened the first time..oops!

I toasted the coconut as suggested by other bakers. I added 1/2 cup of chopped macadamia nuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chunks. The resulting cookies were raved about by all. I omitted the salt because I used salted butter and it is found in the chocolate. I will definetly be using this again!!!

Perfect texture as is!  I always make a double batch, but use half the baking powder, double the vanilla and use no salt.  I pressed down on the cookies before putting them in over & baked at 360 for 12 min.  Addicting!!  I wouldn't substitute anything else.

Yummy.  Instead of dropping by teaspoon, I made mine about a large tablespoon size, baked 10-11 mins. Makes about 3 dozen.  I think teaspoon size of dough would be very very small cookies.

I made these cuz i had some coconut in my fridge that i wanted to use. I thought they turned out really good, and i made a few variations. I also used Crispix (had it on hand) and added chocolate chips, and used a little less salt. they come out plenty salty, and are nice and chewy/crispy. thanx!

These were awesome!  In trying to make these a healthier treat, I subbed applesauce for the butter.  They were a little sticky on the bottom, but tasted great!

This was a great cookie!! I followed the recipe except I didn't include the salt and 1/2'd the baking soda. This cookie is so good!! I love a crispy cookie and this hit the spot. Great recipe, I will be making this again!

These cookies were absolutely wonderful! I've since made them twice.  The second time I made these I added a few golden raisins to the mix.  They were awesome.  Very similar to a ranger cookie minus the chocolate.  Definitely a must try!

I loved these cookies, really lived up to the title. Used Honey Bunches of Oats, chilled in fridge before baking so they would not spread as much. Added chocolate chips to half of the batch to try, good both ways- really great cookie- thanks!

My husband ate it off the baking tray and his comment was "the best coconut cookie I ever ate"!! I didn't use cornflakes but did add walnuts. I put the timer on for 8 minutes, half way through the baking i noticed they didn't flatten so I flattened them with a spoon and left them for the full 10 minutes. Next time I would leave them in for 8. They were good but crispy, not chewy.

These were very yummy. I made a few slight changes to the recipe. I wanted to make them a little healthier so I cut the butter down to 5 Tbl and substituted applesauce for the other 3 Tbl. I added some semi-sweet chocolate chips (just a few) and substituted quick oats for the rolled oats, as that was all I had. They definitely present some competition to my usual recipe!

I am not a cookie baker.  I much prefer candy, cakes and pies.  I was asked to bring cookies to a luncheon so I searched the net and found this one.  It is wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and the cookies turned out perfectly and were all eaten.  It was so easy and used ingredients that I always have on hand.  I will definitely be making more of these.

I like them.  But here are my issues.  I used margarine instead of butter because that is what I had.  I used a mini scoop to put the dough on the sheet pan, maybe that packed the dough too tight.  To get them to flatten enough I cooked them for twice the recommended amount of time.  They aren't burned, they are perfect in color.  But they are now dunkers instead of chewy gooey cookies.  I used an all natural cereal by Nature's Path called Flax Plus Pumpkin Raisin Crunch and this was great in the recipe.  Because it is a mixture of flakes, pumpkin seeds, granola clusters and raisins there was a lot of flavor bang for the buck.  I am going to try the recipe again but try flattening them a little, different kinds of cereals, a little cinnamon would be nice, etc...  Thanks for a great starter recipe!!

Delicious! Didn't have any cereal on hand, so instead used a bit more coconut, and added some butterscotch chips. Really good without the cornflakes, but next time will try using them.

while these taste absolutely delicious; I thought they were too dry because they completely fell apart after being cooked
(I baked the coconut first as many people suggested, and I also used rice krispies instead of cornflakes)

Can someone tell me what I did wrong?  I followed the recipe but I had to do a REAlLY big batch, I was making 12 dozen.  Anyway, The cookies didn't flaten at all when they baked so we added tons more butter and eggs because it was all very dry.  I looked over the recipe a million times and I didn't make a mistake. After I added extra butter and eggs it worked much better...although still not like the picture. I bought my cornflakes already crushed, they were more like crumbs...was that the problem?  I had to hand mix it and man, this stuff scratches...haha.  I rated it 4 because I know it tastes good, I ate tons of the dough!!

YUMMY!!!!  I made these just as the recipe states and they were wonderful.  My family ate them quicker then I could make them so I ended up having to make another batch. A good coconut flavor...perfect.  They even replaced my hubbys favorite cookie.

On their own, I would give these a higher rating, but I had really hoped for some chew. Sadly, these were just crispy- almost hard. I often add coconut to my oatmeal cookies, which stay chewy and crisp. In the future, I will just stick to this method, and avoid the hassle of cornflakes and hard cookies. But- for those who like a crisp cookie, this did have a nice flavor and was easy.

These cookies taste AWESOME!!!  I lOVE coconut and that helps, I guess!  They're easy to overbake, so keep a close eye.  I thought these were GREAT and I'll definitely make them again...(and again and again---this week alone!)  ENJOY!

These are so good!  I substituted half the vanilla with coconut extract for added flavor.  My husband thought they were a little salty.  I didn't, but I may adjust the salt next time.... and there WILL be a next time!

I made these cookies according to recipe.  They are delicious, chewy with a little crunch.  I did not find them salty as some said.  Even my kids, who do not like coconut, ate them and asked for some in their lunchbox for school.  I'll add this one to my recipe book.  Will try some variety next time, chocolate chips, nuts, dipped in chocolate.  Sounds yummy!  Thanks for sharing.

I liked these, other people seemed to leave them alone though.  They definitely live up to their name and are fine if you make them bigger.

I wasn't sure what the texture of these cookies would be like, as they are called chewy and crispy. They are excellent! I baked them for 10 minutes and they were chewy, but had a slight crunch as you bite into them from the crushed cereal. I added chocolate chips. Next time I may try adding some walnuts as well. These are my new favorite!

These are awesome!  Crispy on the edges and chewy in the center.  I took them to work and everyone loved them and kept asking for the recipe.

Oh yummy.  I reduced the white sugar by half, and used a little less coconut.  For the butter, I used half margarine and half butter.  They're flying out of the cookie tin, so they're a hit.  Thanks for a winner.

These are the best cookies ...migod, I've made two batches now and everytime I want a cookie I think of these.
I suggest cooking them longer for super crispy crunchy yumminess, so they are browned on the edges. ...stick with the average time if you want that chewiness though. I like to make one tray more crunchy and one tray more chewy.

I found these cookies to be a little bland. They were also too hard and crunchy.

i was really disappointed by this recipe.  don't know if i did something wrong, but they stayed small and were very crumbly.  they were edible, but i won't make them again.  i have made a similar recipe that turned out really good, so will have to hunt it down.

Yummy!  Mine did not turn out very "crispy", but they were fabulous anyway.  Added chocolate chips, also.
