This is quite an interesting dish.  I had to omit the garlic because I live with a vampire and I had to substitute kale for spinach because that vampire doesn't care for spinach.  I think this needs something more, though I'm not sure what.  It's just not colorful enough.  Diced tomatoes on top?  Red rice instead of brown?  Husband suggests beans and/or corn.  I can't wait to play with it because it really is very good.

Tasted great. Next time I’ll make the rice the night before as I don’t use instant rice. I’ll try adding black beans as well. Overall I would recommend this recipe.

A different, delicious and nutritious breakfast, lunch or light supper.  I used Himalayan Red rice.  It's slightly chewy  and has a nutty taste.

Used 1# of bulk sausage, added a 1/2 cup diced red pepper, 1 cup of sliced mushrooms and sautéed the veggies in with with the sausage. Used 4 cups of cooked basmati brown rice, seasoned to taste and it came out about perfect! Thanks for the recipe!!
