This was good, but like other reviewers, I thought it tasted a little too ketchupy.  Next time I will modify the sauce ingredients to match a sauce for oven-barbecued beef that I've always liked from one of my old Betty Crocker  cookbooks: 1/2 cup chopped onions, 3/4 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup vinegar (can use apple cider vinegar), 1 Tbsp. brown sugar, 3/4 cup water, 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1 Tbsp. prepared mustard, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. pepper.  B.C. says to simmer it for 5 minutes, but I don't think it would hurt to simmer it for up to 15 minutes to meld the flavors.  If anybody out there tries this, let me know how it turns out.  Also, I baked the chicken for 25 minutes, turned it, basted it with the sauce, and baked it for an additional 20 minutes.  It came out fork tender.  I'm from the old school of cooking and still believe in cooking chicken parts and porks chops for at least 45 minutes total.  They've always turned out great!

I made this tonight but did not have all the necessary ingredients.  I used Dijon mustard and yellow mustard instead of mustard powder.  I added a little hot pepper flakes, cumin, paprika, and chili powder to the rest of the ingredients.  I also added a tsp of white sugar, to add a little more sweetness.  It turned out delicious!  I will definately be making this again!  Very moist for baked chicken, and full of flavor.

My husband liked this recipe, so I will probably make it again; but I ended up putting sauce from a bottle on my plate to eat it because I didn't think the sauce was all that great.  And I agree with others....there is no way that this chicken is ready to eat in 25 minutes.  Make sure to allow more cooking time.

I loved this chicken.  It was very good and didn't require getting the grill going which was nice.  Just mix everything together and pop in the oven.  Great with rice.

I greatly enjoyed this recipe.  My husband is very picky on what he eats and even he was very pleased.  I did cut back on the ketchup and used only a 1/2 cup.  It was great.  I will definately be making this again.

I put only half the ketchup and in its place I put 1/4 cup of Hoisin sauce.  My husband is Chinese so we always have it available.  It gave it a fantastic tangy taste. Definitely would have this again.
You can get Hoisin sauce in the Asian section of the grocery store.  Definitely in Chinatown.

I liked the idea of not using bottled bbq sauce and this was very easy to throw together but it was too ketchupy as written.  I upped the other ingredients to cut the ketchup while it was simmering.  I would definitely make this again because it's simple and will try adding other spices to cut the ketchup some more.

I had such high hopes for this. I followed the recipe exactly. Just really tasted like baked chicken with ketchup on it. It's edible, but not something I think I would fix again. Shredded leftovers and made sandwiches the next night. Sorry! Just didn't work for us.

This recipe BLEW me and my family away!  I doubled the recipe for my extended family of 9 (plus lunches the next day).  The only changes I made were using apple cider vinegar rather than white, I used Splenda brown sugar blend, and added a bit of molasses.  After pouring the sauce over the chicken, I heated B&M country style beans in the pot to take on some of the flavor.  Amazing!  Will definitely make again!

WAY TOO SALTY! Between the ketchup, added salt and vinegar, the taste was not pleasant and very overpowering. DO NOT RECOMMEND

I just made this and REALLY loved the flavor of the sauce. I never run out of ketchup, except today of course, so I had to use a little Honey French salad dressing to make up the difference, but i thought it was great. I was baking potatoes at the same time, so for the last 10 mins, i turned the oven up to 450 and I thought the sauce was fine-not too runny!

As is was a little too vinegary for the BF...actually he said that the final product was also but he still rated it a 4. Changes I made when I thought it was going to be too tart. Cooked much longer, added honey, a little dijon mustard, cayenne pepper, butter to help carmelized the onions, worchestershire sauce, garlice powder,followed the rest of the recipe. Next time will not add so much vinegar and probably sub onion powder. BF wanted to know what the mushy things in the sauce were.

Blah!  Way too ketchup-y!  I tried adding more of the other ingredients to tone down the ketchup taste but was unsuccessful.  All we could taste was ketchup and a little bit of chicken.  Won't ever make this one again.  Good you anyone who has a ketchup deficiency.

excellant recipe. next time i'll double the sauce. there was too much moisture in the chicken breasts and it made the sauce pretty runny, so i'm wondering if i added some cornstarch, would this solve the problem?

Way too much ketchup. I read the reviews prior to making this dish and used a touch less ketchup and it was still too much... and I love ketchup. I think this would be better with less ketcup, more brown sugar and onions.

I wanted to use this in my slow cooker.  Since it did not taste good to me, I am scrapping the idea and using a bottle of bbq sauce.

I really, really liked this, but I had to add soooooo much other stuff to it: Cajun Spices, Mrs. Dash, Paprika, Chilli powder, garlic powder, worsteschire sauce, a tiny bit of butter, dill, etc. Though I honestly would have never have thought to do this in the first place. That's why I'm giving this two stars.

These turned out excellent!  I skipped the onions due to personal preference (hubby and I are not fond of them).  I otherwise stuck to the recipe, hubby and I both loved it!  I did have to cook the breasts longer (about 40-45 min. total).  Definitely a keeper for meal planning!

I give the recipe 5 stars for concept. Slap some BBQ sauce on chicken breast for a relatively quick, easy, and healthy dinner. However, the recipe gets 3 stars for the actual results. The sauce is just ok. I tinkered with it best I could with my limited abilities as a beginning cook. I'll make this again, but with a different sauce recipe.

Better than I expected. I used tenderloins instead of breasts (I usually do). Next time I'll probably use cider vinegar.

I used 1/2 the ketchup because I thought it was way too much and substituted the rest for BBQ sauce.  My husband and I liked the flavor and it came out very tender.  I also cooked it a little longer than the recipe said to.

Flavor was good but the sauce came out a little watery so it didn't stick to the chicken.  Might try it again to see if I did something wrong.

This recipe was GREAT!!!  Very easy and tasty too. . this will be one I will make again, only I may change the BBQ sauce up next time, it was a tad bit too sweet for our tastes. . but overall the entire family was ready for seconds!!!

This was okay.  I added just a touch of liquid smoke to the sauce.  I thought there was too much of a ketchup taste. This was easy to prepare but wasn't my favorite.

I did look at the recipe and decided to make it the way Kathy H did and it was awesome. My husband thought it was the best he's had. Kathy I think you ought to add this to the all recipes site so people can see it.

Very moist, very tender, very easy, but tasted too much like ketchup. Would appreciate it if Wolfwalker could adapt the sauce for a more barbeque flavor.

This was a so-so recipe for us.  It definitely had more of a ketchupie taste to it.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  Although I think I'll probably stick with bar-b-q sauce from a jar unless I can find a really good recipe.

After I had made the sauce for this recipe I realized it would be no where near enough to cover the chicken and have extra sauce.  My husband loves food that is extra saucey and I was afraid this would just turn out to be dry. I didn't want to add more ketchup because of the other reviwers warnings, so I added tomatoe sauce and lots of extra brown sugar.  It turned out great, though I am sure was nothing like what it was supposed to be. I am only giving it two stars because I think the original recipe would result in dry, ketuchpy chicken.

I put this together ahead of time and put in fridge.  (I couldn't be home) I left a note for my husband to pop it in oven and set the timer.  He and the kids raved about it.  I had leftovers the next day and it was very good.  My husband hates chicken breast (he likes dark meat) and hates baked chicken even more.  He has talked about it for a week.  I am making it again tonight but with thighs.  This recipie is so easy I am definitly going to use it regularly  by the way I ommited onions because of the kids other than that I followed the recipie.  Thank you Thank you.

Absolutely delicious! My husband and I loved this dish! I was quite pleasantly surprised by the very tangy BBQ flavor of the sauce (except when I went to taste the sauce while it was cooking and discovered the hard way that I'd forgotten to add the brown sugar. Oops!). I served it with mashed potatoes and corn and it was an excellent meal! I will definitely add this to my personal recipe book!

I made this the other night and my boyfriend and I enjoyed it. The chicken was very moist and tender and it had good flavor. I added a bit of garlic powder and cayenne, and next time will use a little bit less ketchup.

Since I only cooked this recipe for one, I was wondering if it would be worth the effort. It definately was! The sauce did taste a little too much like ketchup so I added one more tablespoon brown sugar and one-eighth teaspoon white sugar. It made it sweet and tangy! So delicous! The chicken cooked perfectly. I will definately be making this recipe for others! It's so simple too! I paired it with steamed broccoli and served ontop of brown rice. Yum!

Everyone loved this dish. I thought it was a delicious sweet bbq flavor. I highly recommend it. Make it a true country meal by adding side dishes like rice, corn on the cob, green beans, and some yeast rolls.

4 stars because it was tasty but not perfect. My husband loved this dish and I made it with spanish rice from this site and it was a great and easy meal. The sauce was a bit sweet but it was overall quite good.

This has become a go-to recipe for us. It's got kick and I play with the sauce to give it some more. I don't use dry mustard, I use spicey mustard instead. I also add a little bit of hot sauce sometimes in different flavors. I also don't use onions because my boyfriend doesn't like them. Sometimes I use less ketchup than the whole cup. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! I usually store the leftovers over a thin bed of rice. It's great warmed up as well.

I mixed the ingredients in a bowl, fired up the grill, and brushed the chicken with the sauce, and it tasted excellent.  I also added a little bit of garlic and sugar, which gave it some more flavor.

I made this dish for supper last night and we really liked it.  I made the sauce almost according to the recipe.  I reduced the amount of ketchup to 3/4 cup, I added about 1 tsp of regular mustard as I didn't have quite enough dried on hand, and I added 2 cloves of minced garlic. Once the sauce had cooked for 15 minutes or so, I tasted it and the flavour of the vinegar was really strong....so I added about 1/4 cup of fancy molasses to balance the flavours.  The end result was really good and very quick to make.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I found this simply too sharp. It has far too much vinegar. I'd cut the vinegar to 1/3 cup, the ketchup to 3/4 and add a bit of garlic. Although I'm not likely to make it again...

Delicious. Made this last night. The sauce came out a little runny but it worked well in the end. I had rice with it and since the sauce wasn't sticking to the chicken very well I was able to spoon extra sauce onto the rice

Easy? Check. Delicious? Double Check. A Keeper? Definitely! I accidentally added too much pepper, but it turned out good in the end, it kicked the sauce up!

This recipe sounded interesting and yummy to me when I first read it, but it didn't taste like what I thought it would. It was different, but I liked it. I thought it would have a BBQ-ie taste, but it was more tangy to me...it was nice for a change of pace, but I probably won't make it that often.

So easy! and we had raves tonight. However, I have to admit I made some changes....after reading reviews, I used bottled barbecue sauce. I used chicken thighs with skins and cooked at 350 deg. for 40 minutes. It was so TENDER, tasty and made a delicious sauce that I spooned over the cooked chicken. Saved cleaning the barbecue grill!

I followed the recipe incorporating some of the suggestions...less ketchup, add water, etc.....it tasted very child-like.  We ate it, but the recipe is going in the garbage along with all of the leftovers.  Sorry.

This was ok, but honestly, I don't think it was really good enough to be worth the work of making your own bbq sauce. I think store-bought sauces are just as good, if not better than this.

I added a good amount fresh minced garlic and a few spices (onion powder, garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper, touch Liquid Smoke, Frank's Hot Sauce). This was very tangy--quite heavy on the vinegar and dry mustard. I would like to try this again but cut back on the vinegar/dry mustard by half.

Have made this twice now. Second time I used cider vinegar as suggested by some and I replaced the ketchup with chili sauce but only used1/2 cup. Added 2 TBSP of ketchup with the chili sauce. I also cut back on the sugar and added 2TBSP of molasses.  Sauce was a bit thin so added a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up.  Chili sauce seemed to give it an added kick. I did omit any additional salt as well. I used bone in, skin on chicken breasts and browned them first.

This was very good, however, I did make some changes. This time I used chicken legs and thighs. Next time I will use boneless chicken breasts and I will cook them for a few mins in a sauce pan to get some of the fat out before I put them in the baking dish.  I followed others suggestions to cut down on the ketchup and up some of the other ingredients. I need to find some way to make it thicker. It may help by browning the chicken in a sauce pan first to get rid of some of the fat and increasing the amount of brown sugar. I served chicken over mashed potatoes and had cut corn.  Very good and my hubby liked it, too.

Loved it!  After reading through all the reviews I decided to use your recipe as written.  It was wonderful and spot-on.  I did have plenty of sauce left over as I didn't use as much chicken as it called for.  I definitely will be making this again.

I love this recipe, it's versatile. Make it your own. I always do a whole large onion, cut the ketchup to 3/4 c, add a slurry of half tbsp flour and 1/4 c water so it's not so sweet and ketchuppy and a pinch of each of paprika and chili powder. My husband loves it. We use thighs or legs though not breasts so it cooks for about 45-1 hr. So good! Serve with stuffed zuchini, broccoli or asparagus!

I loved this recipe! It reminded me of the sauce my mother made years ago.  As it cooked in the saucepan and in the oven my mouth was watering.  I also added some chopped yellow pepper as she also used to put sweet bell pepper in hers.

a decent starter, but would never eat it with out adding to the recipe. I added paprika, onion powder, xtra sugar, whiskey, molasses, garlic, Worcester, spicy mustard and dried thyme.
