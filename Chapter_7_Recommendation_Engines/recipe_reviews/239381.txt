I took a chance and made this recipe as is.  I though it was good but it really does need to be baked for an additional 5-10 mins.  Sadly I didn't realize that until I cut into it and I even used a 9 inch vs 8 inch pan.  Thankfully it was done enough to eat but the texture was more of a bread pudding than a pancake. I will try this again with the additional bake time and update my review accordingly. I did like the brown sugar and cinnamon topping! I served this with butter &  maple syrup!

The sugar topping adds a nice crunch, and it didn't deflate as much as baked pancakes usually do when removed from the oven.  I did increase the baking time however.  I served with saut√©ed apples to make a fabulous breakfast.

Excellent! Super easy and yummy. I baked in my convection oven at 400 for a bit over 20 minutes and it was perfect. Once I loosened the sides, it flipped right onto the plate, although unfortunately it left the brown sugar behind. I think I would enjoy this more in a 9 inch pan, I thought it was a little too thick. DBF and DS loved this for supper with some maple sausage patties and fresh cantaloupe. Thanks for the recipe, Shannon!
