I am an old farmer from 'way back and have made my own kraut for years. This is the way I make it, except I don't use a crock, but pack the shredded cabbage directly into wide-mouth quart jars. Store at temperature of 60-70 degrees, covered with an old blanket to keep dark. (I store it in an outbuilding.)In six to seven weeks, we feast on sauerkraut and ribs. Makes about 18 quarts. I run the quarts through a boiling water bath for about 20 minutes to seal.
(A 15" piece of 3/4" dowel makes a great tapper!)

I've been using this recipe for years and it always turns out great - except last year when I left it way too long and it got mushy :(  I use kosher salt instead of canning salt, so have to use 4 Tbsp to get the right weight.  I make the kraut in 5 lb. batches and mix it well in a large container as the salt needs to be evenly dispersed before packing in the buckets.  I use a 5 gallon white food safe bucket (which holds up to 25 pounds of cabbage).  I scrub it well, pre-rinse with a bleach/water solution and then rinse well with water.  I weigh the kraut down with a glass pie plate and gallon jar with water in it.  For more tart kraut, you can also add a cup apple cider vinegar.

My husband makes this recipe twice a year. This recipe is delicious. It makes great gifts. Our friends love it when we give them a jar. We seem to never have enough on hand. In Pennsylvania, using fall cabbage is best, but since we winter in Florida we make a recipe in the July, then again in October, before we go to Floida.

So easy, so yummy! I use my food processor to do my shredding, and used a plastic container from my wine making kit(about a six gallon volume) to do the packing.  A large plate was a perfect weight, topped off with a large plastic bag filled with salt water. This bag spreads out and seals the edges over the plate on the cabbage.  I had absolutely no scum formation.  I did use the lid that came with the plastic container, also.

I had my doubts, but it worked.  The final product was relatively crisp and mild...and very salty.  With a large batch it is difficult to gauge the cabbage weight, so I may have oversalted.  I drained the brine and rinsed before cooking and it cut the saltiness, but diminished the taste a bit.  It stinks while brewing, and the gasses produced from fermentation make the kraut volume increase a bit, so put it in a slightly larger container than you think it needs.  Will stain plastic.

Very easy, very good.  I only made 25 pounds of it this year, and ran out before next cabbage season.  I'll definitely make more of it next time.

I used a similar method as another Reviewer, "camprunfarm."  Used the slicing disc on my food processor, packed in a food grade bucket (disinfected with a diluted bleach solution and rinsed really well). I used a plastic canister as a muddler to do the packing - this covered a lot of area instead of using a spoon or dowel.  I always use sea salt.  Topped with a heavy dinner plate and a jug of water w/lid to hold everything below the brine, and used an inverted large bowl as a lid for the bucket, then covered with a heavy bath towel to keep it dark. Checked it daily; no scum ever formed!  I've packed it in individual jars before now, but with the jars you have to pack it down every day to keep it below the brine so nothing gunky will form.  :-)  Bucket method is awesome when processing 3 or more heads of cabbage at once, and you can get one at your local hardware store for only a few bucks.

I add one whole head of roasted garlic run through the food processor with a bit of water and salt from the recipe.  That way it mixes in easily and disperses quickly.  I use a 1/2 gal. jug that I pack tightly.  Allow extra room for the cabbage to "Grow" a bit while it ferments.  Once you get a nice flavor you can take it out of the jug and can it in mason jars processed for 20 minutes in a BWB.  That will allow you to get the next batch started quickly, trust me once you get a taste you will never buy store kraut again.  Make several batches for yourself and friends. I also add a Tsp. of mustard seed, fennel seed and 1/2 cup of vinegar to add some balance and zing to the salty sweet taste of the cabbage.  Use the freshest and firmest heads of cabbage available, they should feel heavy for their size.  A mandolin makes quick work of getting a uniform thickness in the cabbage.  This Recipe, home made pastrami, rye bread and Russian dressing recipes make it a 100% from scratch home made meal, the wait is worth it.  And I get to practice my favorite hobby which is preparing wholesome, fresh home cooked meals for my wife and son.  Since I am a stay at home disabled dad I thoroughly enjoy those kinds of a challenge!!!

Using a postal scale, weigh the cabbage in grams.  Divide by 50 for grams of salt.

This is almost identical to the recipe I use and have used for years. My grandmother and great grandmother also made kraut the same way. But I have never simmered the kraut or canned it. I simply keep it in cold storage - in my case a spare refrigerator in a different building. Now that my grown son and his family know where I keep it I may have to find a new hiding spot, though.

I was really skeptical about making kraut, but this recipe was great. I put it in a large plastic container, covered it with the cheese cloth and in 2 1/2 weeks I had wonderful kraut.  Another recipe noted that the kraut had been covered with an "old blanket", blocking out light that can cause foam.  I did this and it worked great.

We didn't have luck with this at all.  The smell was unbearable, had to throw it out.
