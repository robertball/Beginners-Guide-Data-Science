As is, I don't think its the "best" but with a few MINOR additions, puts this recipe among the top. I too added 2 TBLS softened butter, used Miracle Whip instead of mayo, and less garlic powder (apprx half). BUT I added in a pinch of crushed rosemary, pinch of ground thyme, and a dash of dried oregano. This really added depth to the bread and is on our top 10 list of favorite garlic breads. Great with pasta! Thanks Kendra!

Good Recipe.  I have one that my family likes better.  3/4 cup mayo, 4 oz parm cheese, 5 oz cheddar and jack mix, 2 tsp. granulated garlic, 1/8 cup fresh parsley and 1/2 oz green onion and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper.  Then I bake it at 375 for 5-7 minutes, I tend to burn using the broiler.

I make this same recipe using french bread cut in half length wise.  In a bowl mix up about 1/2 cup mayo with about 1 cup shredded mozzarela cheese.  ON the bread I spread butter on both pieces and sprinkle that with garlic powder and then spread the mayo mixture over that.  This gets broiled med to low for about 3-4 minutes (until cheese mixture is browned and bubbling).  I have never made this recipe and not been asked for the recipe.  It can be very rich but with pasta it is AWESOME!!!

Like others, I thought the title was misleading...  However this recipe has possibilites if you cut back on the garlic powder and grated Parmesan. I added some softened butter along with the mayo and some herbs such as oregano and Italian seasoning. You have to play with this one in order to get the garlic bread you're looking for...

Just to clarify, you need to use real mayo, NOT miracle whip. The miracle whip will give it a sweeter funny taste. The Mayo is only to hold the ingredients together, that is also why it is important to make sure it is a paste consistency. Add more or less garlic to taste, I like lots. I get lots of requests and compliments on this garlic bread. It is awesome with a good lasgna.

I read many different recipes and I am reviewing this one since I used this one as a base and went from there.  I used softened butter and spread on bread first then combined mayo, 3 garlic cloves, parm cheese, oregano and salt to taste.  Strong garlic flavor, you can use 2 cloves if you dont like it so strong.  The bread was very tasty and I would make this again.  My kids said this was they way they always want garlic bread.

The name doesn't describe the end result by far.  The ingredients have possibilities, but the quantities need adjustment.  Sorry, we thought it was awful.

Well, I burnt it.  My bad.  I got sidetracked and most of the bread burnt under the hot broiler.  There was enough for the meal, but I like leftovers too.  The bread that survived was good, not great. I expected a "paste" that was a little thinner.  It was hard to get on the bread--too thick for a brush, for sure.  I had to use a spoon.  There are better garlic bread recipes on this website.

Absolutely YUM! Only thing i added was a little bit of Italian seasoning to the mix before spreading it. The second time I made this I added shredded cheese on top before baking it, even better!

We didn't really care for this. The mayonnaise is just too weird, and it would have tasted a lot better with fresh garlic.

Very good.  I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, and I added about three tablespoons of softened butter.  Tasty!

Yum! Made this for the first time last night with some left over french bread that I had. It was delicious! I only had a tablespoon on mayo on hand so, I did the other half butter. Will only make it this way from now on.

It turned out pretty good. I did not bother to make a paste out of the mayo, cheese and garlic powder.  I just spread some butter on the bread then some mayo, then sprinkled the parmesan cheese and garlic powder, then popped it into my toaster oven for a minute or two until it got bubbly.

If you start with frozen garlic bread, omit the garlic and put on the mayo/parm mixture it's fantastic and super easy.

Very good and easy! Like some users, I also added a little bit of butter. Next time I will definetly cut the garlic powder in half though. A little strong.

Delicious starter garlic bread.  Instead of powder I used roasted garlic cloves mashed well combined with both butter and mayo, parm and fresh parsley.  Lots of compliments!

This is wonderful garlic bread as is.  However, I used mayo with olive oil for a healthier option, as well as chopped garlic rather than the powder and it was just as good.  I make my garlic bread this way all of the time!

Quick and easy. I added one clove of garlic in addition to a pinch of garlic powder.  I also buttered the loaves before adding the cheese spread. Delicious!

I don't know why this comment I left on here a year ago only had the word " I ", but 2 users found it useful so that was funny! It was to be con't with... never really liked garlic bread until this recipe, NOW I CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!! I guess if you already love garlic bread, the bubbly creamy topping might not be your fav...or it just might make you never go back to your old recipe again. Happy Eating!

*Tried this using butter too and preferred mayo, but both were yummy!!!!

I made this using Smart Balance Healthy mayo (1/2 fat) and then followed the rest of the recipe on some slices of my homemade sourdough bread.  It's a keeper and I'll be making it again.

The absolute best garlic bread I ever had!! I used a loaf of Italian bread. I did add fresh roasted garlic, since I had some already done for my spaghetti sauce. Also about 1 Tbsp. of my Fleishmans Olive oil spread was added in. We ate the whole loaf, one glorious slice at a time!

This is so simple and really tasty. I've made this a few times now and will continue to make it. I do use a blend of Italian shredded cheeses instead of the grated parmesan. Thanks :)

This wasn't bad, but I'd never make it again.  Regular garlic bread (with butter) is just way too much better than this to make this again.  I used a little extra mayo (maybe a teaspoon extra) and it formed a paste as described which I spread over the bread (use a rubber spatula...a knife didn't work well).  Well, it was just topping sitting right on top of the bread.  I like how the butter sinks into the bread when making real garlic bread...that didn't happen at all with this recipe.  It didn't taste bad, it wasn't what I was looking for.  Thanks anyway!

Pretty good!  Do as the comments say . . . just add mayo until moistened.

Not the best garlic bread I've ever had, but not bad either.  Something was a little too overpowering--just couldn't tell if it was the garlic or parm cheese.  Next time I will adjust some of the ingredients.

Love, love, love! I usually make my own French bread, but I had some sourdough hoagie rolls in the freezer and decided to use those (2 of the sandwich size rolls to make 4 pieces - you could also cut those in half to make 8 decent size pieces).

I used softened butter (maybe 2 tbsp.) as others have suggested, spreading it on the rolls.  I mixed the 2 tbsp. Best Foods/Hellman's mayo, 1/4 cup parmesan (vs. 1/2), and 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic in a bowl, then spread it onto the bread with a spoon.  Topped that with a sprinkle of "Italian Blend" shredded cheese from a bag (mozzarella, mild cheddar, smoked provolone & asiago).

I ran them under the broiler and watched them carefully until they reached golden brown perfection (which only took maybe 3 minutes - don't walk away!).

My husband said it was "a home run outta the park hit" and "the best garlic bread I've EVER had!"  :)  Brilliant!!

I changed this a lot, but I have it 5 stars because the basic idea is good and I never would have thought of using mayo on garlic bread if I hadn't seen this recipe.  I made this twice this weekend.  The first time I made it, I used my normal recipe and also made a variation of this one cause I was scared this might be weird.  (I mixed about 1 1/2 tbs butter with garlic, spread on bread and lightly toasted.  I then spread the mayo/fresh minced garlic/Parmesan/italian seasoning mixture over that and broiled until it was nice and brown and bubbly.). We both liked the bread with the mayo topping the best with our chicken parm.  The second night I used my leftover marinara for chicken meatball subs and made them on garlic bread using the mayo topping again.  They were seriously to die for.  One of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  Give this a shot, but I do suggest fresh garlic and letting the mayo mixture's flavors combine for a little while.

I made this for my family and they are very picky about their food. They just loved it, however, I used fat free miracle whip and added 1/2 fat free cheddar cheese and 1/2 parmesan. It was very good and I cut the fat. I make it often.

I needed to use up a half loaf of french bread made this recipe.  I had to scale back to four servings and added a bit of softened butter to the mayo mixture.  Kids were fighting over the last piece!

I liked the flavor, but the mayo didn't melt down into the bread; it just flaked off when we tried to eat it.  Tried it with butter instead and it was great.

Simple but good. Instead of mayo, I just mixed 2 tbsp of melted margarine to the mix, plus I buttered the loaf of bread before putting this spread on.

I loved this bread. I make garlic bread at least twice a week and have been using the same recipe my mother has used for years, but this will now become the one I use.
Just made a few alteration; I used low fat mayo, garlic salt, and sour dough and it came out great. Even my husband who doesn't like mayo loved it. 
Excellent and super simple recipe!!!

This bread was awesome! The only thing I did different was used half the amount of garlic powder and added about a tablespoon of fresh crushed garlic. I also needed 1 1/2 of the recipe to cover the 1# loaf of french bread.

DIDNT CARE FOR THIS AT ALL...BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN MY FAULT. I USED FAT FREE MAYO WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN WHY I DIDNT LIKE IT...I LIKE TO GO LOW FAT IN RECIPES BUT MAYBE THIS ONE WAS ONE I SHOULDNT HAVE TRIED TO.

This is great if you don't put it on too thick because the bread will be mushy underneath.  I
used 2 T. butter, 2 T. Miracle Whip and Italian seasonings along with less garlic.

This is an ok start. I like really flavorful garlic bread so I added 2T butter, pinch of oregano, rosemary and sea salt. Taste then add more accordingly. I baked at 400 until browned so the bottom wasn’t soft.

This was really easy and loved by all at a recent family dinner.   Only changes I made was to use 1/2 mayonnaise called for and used 1/2 butter for total original amount of mayonnaise called for in original recipe.   So easy when cooking for a crowd.  I had spread on all of the bread on sheet pans and just before we all sat down for dinner placed the pans under the broilers.   Will make over and over again.

If you want to make it a little healthier, try plain yogurt in place of the mayo...it worked out just fine for me!  I also added some fresh garlic, a little onion powder, and Italian seasoning.  I put it on top of slightly toasted english muffins and then set them under the broiler.  Very easy, very tasty!

I had my daughter mix this recipe up according to the directions while I finished up dinner, and it was wonderful!  Easy and delicious.

This was delicious with the addition of approximately 1 1/2 tbsp margarine creamed with the mayo and cheese mix. Used slightly less garlic and a great crusty bread. Thanks!

Very good, very easy!  I broiled a tad too long (about 4 minutes), but it was really good nonetheless.  Would definitely make again!

Oh my gosh how good this is!!! Definitely make sure this is pastey. The idea here is that the mayo doesn't soak into the bread like say butter or margarine would. Hence it has a think cooked topping when it comes out. 

I did this in the oven at 425 degrees (I burn everything I broil) and it was just delicious.

I loved it and so did everyone eles.  only 1 thing, make sure when you mix it that its a thick paste and the more dark brown it is when you broil it the better! thanks for the great recipe.

To cut down on the fat and calories I suggest you use low fat oleo and Mrs.Dash garlic and herb flavored no salt additive - mix to your liking.

I added fresh minced garlic and dried parsley on top before broiling.  This was wonderful.  I will make this often.

This was decent, but not the "best" I've ever had.  I'm used to making garlic bread with fresh garlic instead of powder, so maybe I'll try this next time with one clove of minced garlic instead of the powder.  Thanks though Kendra!
