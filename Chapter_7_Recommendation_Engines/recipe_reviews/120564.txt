I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  My husband is not a fan of coffee cakes, but I keep trying anyway and this one was a success!  To minimize excess use of ingredients if it wasn't successful, I cut the recipe in half.  I used a regular 9" round cake pan to bake it.  No problems with that.  My cake didn't turn out dense like other reviewers and I think it's because I beat the butter, cream cheese, sugar, eggs, and vanilla until REALLY light and fluffy.  The cake was really light, which was a plus for us.  I used this recipe as a dessert and served with homemade whipped topping on the side.  So good!  Thank you!

Excellent. Made in a bundt pan. Doubled the topping, put first in pan, then half batter, rest of topping, rest of batter.  I used Ghiardelli choc chips.  Divine.

Oh my gosh! AMAZING! I followed all directions and I just added more chocolate chips, but used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet which I recommend! I can't wait to share this with others! Make sure your butter and cream cheese is room temp. before mixing to ensure the batter can be whipped together well.

This is a very moist coffee cake which I love!  I made this as a "Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake" using half unsalted butter and half peanut butter, half semi-sweet chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips.  It was so peanutty ;) For the topping (I doubled the amount, then sprinkled in the middle too), I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I made three different types of pans at the same time.  I baked @350F for 55 mins with a 7" springform pan, for 30 mins with 6 standard muffin cups and for 25 mins with 8 mini muffin cups out of this recipe.  I will definitely make this again :)

WOW! The first time I get this much of a good reaction from everyone in the family for a coffee cake! Everyone said it was perfect tasting, had a perfect texture and the perfect amount of chocolate(I did add a little bit more than a cup). It was dense, yet light, somewhat simlar to a pound cake as another reviewer noticed as well. If there was anything negative with it, trust me, my family is not too shy to let me know! They really all loved it, and it was all gone very quickly! Thanks so much for this awesome recipe, 100% delish!

My first question is why does the rating system only go to 5 stars.  This was totally wonderful.  A big hit for dessert last night and even better this morning for breakfast.

Really delicious! Used a bigger pan and baked it alittle bit longer. Added an egg, and used brown sugar in the topping and more chocolate chips.

ABSOLUTE BEST COFFEE CAKE.  You have to try this.  I made mine in a bundt pan and it worked really well.  I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the "topping," sprinkled half of it on the bottom of the bundt, poured half the batter in, then sprinkled the remaining topping on, and the remaining batter.   I agree with other reviewers: beat sugar, butter, and cream cheese until light and fluffy for a light and fluffy cake!

Awesome, and i cannot stop eating this. It melts in your mouth. The only changes I made were to put about 1 serving of dry instant coffee into the topping and I baked it in a 9x13 till tested done. WOW!!

Excellent coffee cake. I added extra chocolate chips to the batter. Made a small amount of chocolate glaze and drizzled it over the top but will leave that off next time, it does not need it.

This coffee cake turned out really moist and not so heavy as I expected to be. I used fat free cream cheese to cut on fat and used walnuts because that's what I had on hand. Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly as is.

This is very attractive and delicious.  The combination of the butter and cream cheese make it very soft and moist.  There weren't enough pecans to cover the whole cake, so they looked kind of scattered and weird.  So I would add more pecans, or skip them all together and just put cinnamon and sugar on top.  Also, my pecans burned a little, I think because there's no butter in the topping.  I don't really know how to fix that problem.  Overall, excellent, and everyone complimented me on how it looked and tasted.

Excellent cake, followed the recipe with the exception of the nuts. I had a recipe similar to this, the only difference was using cream cheese instead of sour cream that my recipe called for. Bake time was 55 minutes for me, house smelled amazing while it was baking and presentation was nice.

I made 1/2 this recipe today (still using a 9 inch springform pan) and it was excellent.  Took about 30 min in the oven and I coated the chocolate chips in flour to keep them from sinking to the bottom.  Will definately make this again and again.

Great flavor but this came out a bit dense and dry for us. I may have overcooked it by a few minutes.  Thanks for the recipe Michelle.

Made this over the weekend for my teen daughter and six of her friends and they all raved about how good it was.  One girl has a nut allergy, so I left the nuts off the top using only the sugar/cinnamon. I will be making again soon.

Used butter instead of margarine and low fat cream cheese, also used a 10" springform pan.....SOOOOOO yummy! Used mini chocolate chips, too. This was  rich and dense with a grreat flavor from the chocolate chips and the cinnamon. Nice change and combo of flavors. Great cake...thanks!

Dee-licious.  Very forgiving and adaptable recipe.  I inadvertently put the whole amount of sugar in the batter and did not remove 1/2 cup as directed.  Cake was a little heavier from it but not unpleasantly so.   I also subbed soy products for the dairy and it worked just fine.   It smelled so good while baking that I had to slap a few hands back from cutting it right away.  Yeah, that didn't last, it was gone in a flash.  Definably a keeper!

Texture of this cake was very nice, tender and moist.  I hate it when people rate a recipe when they haven't tried it as written, but I did substitute 1/2 c. peanut butter for half the butter and 1/2 c. peanut butter chips for half the chocolate chips, as someone else suggested.  My husband LOVED this cake and reminded me to save the recipe.  I thought it was very good, but not exceptional. However, I am planning on keeping the recipe because I want to try it as written.  At any rate, it is a very nice coffee cake and worth making.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I love this recipe!!  I put the batter in a 9 x 13 pan because I don't have a spring form pan.  I also didn't put all of the cinn. and sugar mixture on top of the batter.  For me it would have been too much.  I also used mini semi sweet chocolate chips.  The cake has substance using the cream cheese.  I will definitely make it again and again.  It is pretty easy to prepare.  My husband liked it also.

Very good recipe! 
The only thing I changed was topping. I substituted a teaspoon of instant coffee instead of cinnamon. I left out the nuts and added some of the left over chocolate chips to the top of the cake directly after pulling it out of the oven!

Fantastic, easy to make with common ingredients found as pantry staples. The cake was moist, not too sweet and great for gatherings.  I will be making this again!

Oh Yes! Perfect coffee cake that is great for company. I used 1.5 cups of chocolate chips and substituted walnuts for pecans because this is what I had on hand. For the topping, per others suggestions, I used a combo of brown and white sugar and this worked well.

This recipe was originally published by Marleen Sorosky in her cookbook "Cookery for Entertaining" in the 70's.  It really bugs me when recipes are published without acknowledging the original author! Nevertheless, this is a wonderful coffee cake that has become a family favorite.  The cake is wonderfully moist and the combo of the cinnamon sugar and pecan topping along with the chocolate chips in the cake is to die for.

Deliciously flavourful cake, perfect with  a hot drink and melting ice cream!  The only thing I changed was the sugar - splitting it half and half with brown instead of all white, and using only brown for the crumble coating.  Made it in a silicone bake pan and it came out beautifully!  Have already made it twice in a week.

I'm an experienced baker but had trouble with this recipe.  I made it once following the diections and the cake fell and was tacky in the center.  The second time, I made a few adjustments, beat the sugar and butter longer and baked it 15 minutes more than suggested.  It still fell creating a tacky, gummy center.  On the plus side the flavor was very good.  I will not use this recipe again.

Great recipe!  I omitted the nuts and made sure to beat the butter mixture very well until it was light and fluffy and it wasn't heavy at all.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I brought it to work and a co-worker told me it's the best cake she's ever had.  I didn't have a springform pan so I baked this in a bundt pan.  I used a third of the topping in the bottom of the bundt pan, then a half of the batter, then another third of the topping, the remainder of the batter and remainder of the topping.  I did it this way since I was using a bundt pan.  It turned out great.  Mine was done at 1 hour in my oven.  It is a very soft, tender cake so at first it didn't look cooked through but it was.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome tasting cake!  At the very last moment I realized I didn't have enough white flour, so I had to use 1.5 cups of wheat flour.  It turned out great!  I would either add a little butter to the topping next time or mix it in with the batter as some reviewers suggested.  I used toffee chips instead of pecans as someone suggested.  Definitely will make again!

FANTASTIC.  Followed some of the suggestions - 

Replaced chocolate chips with butterscotch chips.  Split brown sugar and white sugar for the topping.  

Everyone at work loved it!  Not a crumb left.

Excellent recipe. Had an extra fancy bag of chocolate chips on hand and wanted to do more than a cookie...Perfect! Cake was moist, buttery and delicious. I wanted a crumb topping on mine and made a simple one of flour, butter and brown sugar and put half the cinnamon in the cake batter and the other half in the crumb topping. Would be equally delicious without, however. Making again for ladies brunch later in the week. Truly a prize winning recipe and a KEEPER for sure!  Well done!

This was a great recipe I added toffee bits instead of pecans and used brown sugar for the top instead of white sugar. All in all this cake turned out very nice in my opinion it tasted better the next day, thanks for the recipe!

Thought this was a little fussy and couldn't imagine the taste would equal how much work there was - I was pleasantly surprised!!  Made it as written and would not change a thing...not heavy and not too chocolate-y which my non chocoholic daughter appreciated.  Warmed with a dollop of coffee ice cream and this is to DIE for!

I have made this cake twice now.  It seems the time for the baking is not good.  It says 50-55 minutes but I have found that I need about 70 minutes or so.  I am sure my oven is not that far off.

My husband liked this coffee cake, although I wasn't as impressed.  I left out the pecans but otherwise followed the recipe.  I found that the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom so it might be better to save about a quarter cup to sprinkle on the top before adding the cinnamon/sugar mixture.

Fabulous as is!  Also made gluten-free by substituting  Pamela's GF Pancake mix for the flour and adding just a pinch more of baking soda and baking powder.  Wow!  Wrked out really well, too! Now I just have to slice and freeze some single servings before my gluten tolerant family finishes this cake off...

This recipe is fantastic! I have made it in a spring form pan, mini bundt cake pan and individual mini cake pans...it always turns out beautifully. The only thing I do different is add some toffee bits and a white chocolate drizzle!

I had to make this last night at about 11:00 to take to a function today.  I didn't realize until it was already in the oven that I had only added 1 stick of butter, instead of 1 cup of butter.  I was worried that it wouldn't turn out right, but it turned out wonderful.  Easy to cut, very moist, and the chocolate chips are pure heaven.  I did a combination of mini semi-sweet chips and milk chocolate chips.  I used walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had.  I loved it and so did everybody at the swim meet.  Thanks!

This tastes even better when you use a whole bag or butterscotch chips instead of a cup of chocolate chips

This was excellent.  I used low fat cream cheese, mini chocolate chips and only made half of the recipe and used a pie pan.  I pressed the topping into the batter before baking.  2/20/14 - we make this all the time...it's by far our favorite.  We still make a half recipe but use a 9x5 pan.

This is a great recipe! I made it as written, except skipped the nuts in the topping, because of nut allergies in the family. I wasn't sure how the chocolate chips would taste in contrast to the rich, cinnamon sugar topped cake, and was pleasantly surprised to see how good this was! The cake part was the best...super moist, dense, and rich, with a tender, buttery crumb. I'll be making this one again! I'm going to try some different variations of this as well...the cake part is so delicious...it would be great with blueberries, raspberries, and peaches. Thanks for sharing the recipe....I'll be making this again!!!

Perfect!  Loved everything about this coffee cake.  It turned out very moist and just sweet enough.  The only thing I did differently was to bake it in a 9x13 glass dish for 45 minutes and it turned out great!  Thanks!

Hands down the best coffee cake I have ever made or tasted!!! It was not dry at all, very moist. I added some Heath bits in the cake along with the chocolate chips. I also subbed the Heath Bits for the pecans on top...so yummy! It looked beautiful, smelled delicious while baking and, most of all, was loved by all. Thanks so much for this keeper of a recipe!

I made it with chocolate/peanut butter chips and baked it is a bundt cake pan. I also changed the cinnamon sugar to cocoa and sugar. It turned out wonderfully and the family loved it! Very easy to make too.

Excellent - was a big hit at work! Instead of using chocolate chips, I melted them and swirled in the chocolate with the rest of the batter before baking. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This was really good. I used walnuts instead of pecans. Also, watch the time since ovens are different.  I set my timer for 45 minutes, and it was completely done at 45 minutes, so be careful not to overcook. Will make this again.

Everyone loved this coffee cake, even though it hadn't cooked all the way through. I substituted more chocolate chips for the pecans because my sister is allergic to pecans.  I will make it again, though I will cook it longer than the instructions this time:)

I followed another reviewer, and beat my butter, cream cheese and sugar until SUPER fluffy, and ended up with the perfect coffee cake for a birthday breakfast at work. I also upped the amount of chocolate, and chopped a few pieces to put on top. Every one loved it, and I barely had but 2 pieces to bring home! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

Absolutely delicious.  The first time I made this the middle fell as it cooled - was undercooked and gooey. ( I'd checked for doneness but maybe more to the sides than the center.)  I ended up throwing it out and went out to get the ingredients to try  again.....it had smelled so good baking I knew it would taste great.  I checked my oven temp. and it was right on the money.  Second attempt turned out fine - the cake is dense so I think you need to watch carefully to bake until done but not overdone.  I used a 9 inch springform pan.  Served for Easter brunch to rave reviews.

I made this for my boyfriend who is Gluten free and dairy free.  I subbed out the butter for a vegan spread, the cream cheese for soy cream cheese and the flour for a gluten free ap flour mix.  It came out great.  Tasted like the real thing, if I served it to someone they would have never guessed it was altered.

Absolutely delicious! We loved that it wasn't overly sweet. Since I read a few reviews that it was a little dense so I used Neufchatel cheese instead of the cream cheese, which I think made it airier and lighter. It was so fluffy and tender!

This was amazing!  I forgot to mix in  the chocolate chips and it was in the oven already before I noticed.  I pulled it out and sprinkle some over the top and lightly pressed them in some.  This is SO moist I'm guessing from the cream cheese?  Anyway my husband is going to take the rest to work and I KNOW those guys are gonna love it!  Great recipe!!

This is a 5 star coffee cake.  You can"t go wrong with chocolate, butter, pecans, cinnamon.  Your taste buds make your eyes roll in your head on the very first bite.  I didn't change a thing.  I did mix everything in my stand mixer to whip it lighter.  It is a rich heavenly cake.  It compliments a cup of coffee to a fault.  There were left overs after serving this cake to my company.  My husband suggested we save the leftvers and share them with a rich cup of coffee in the evenings.  I thought to myself this cake is giving us coffee cake dates.  How cool is that?

This is an absolutey wonderful coffee cake! I made half the recipe and baked it in a 9" cake pan for 27 minutes. The cake is light, fluffy and perfectly moist. The topping is crunchy and delicious. I did double the amount of pecans, and I'm really glad I did. I also used lowfat cream cheese, which is all I had on hand. I don't know if that made a difference in the final product or not, but I will use it again since this cake is so awesome and turned out so perfectly! Thank you for the recipe!

The batter was so light and fluffy, but overall the cake did not  have alot of flavor. It all seemed to be in the topping. It might be better with the nut mixture altered  with the batter in layers so the flavor is through out. Is is a very pretty cake.

wow! this cake was amazing, i tried this out last night and my mom flipped. I baked the cake in a bundt pan because i didn't have a spring form and it was just as great. I also took out the pecans. Besides those two the cake was still fantastic!

Very good! I brought it into work and it was well received. Not all of the cinnamon/sugar mixture baked in on the top so I will probably swirl that in next time. Also the top caved in for some reason. But will add it to my list of coffee cake recipes that I like!

Nice cake but very "cakey/doughy" to our taste.  Slices warmed up tasted wonderful but cold...not so much.  I made exactly as the recipe stated without any tweaks!  Cheers...

Not bad, but nothing spectacular.  I took this to a church brunch and brought about 1/3 home.  To be fair, there was plenty of food, but I was hoping people would love it so much, they'd go back for seconds.  I also have to say I didn't have any problems eating the leftovers. :) Again, not bad - just not the wow factor I was hoping for.

I used more chocolate chips in the batter, used brown sugar instead of white for the topping and add chocolate chips to the topping.  It was perfect!

My cake looked done when it came out of the oven, but after 15 minutes the middle sunk.  Luckily, I cut it before serving it, because it was raw in the middle.  I followed the recipe exactly and even cooked it for 60 minutes.  Fortunately, I made One Bowl Chocolate Cake III as a back up and it worked well.  I'm not making this cake again!

This was really great!  I used one reviewers advice and really creamed the cream cheese and butter batter and it was nice and fluffy.  I couldn't get my hands on my nine inch springform pan so I used two 9 in round cake pans and it was great.  I was able to make one without nuts for my husband and the bake time was significantly shorter 35 min or so.

The only things I changed on this recipe was that I added about 3/4 cup more choc. chips and I omited the pecans. It is a beautiful cake, and SO EASY to make. I will make this again and again. I cooked it for 55 min - just as recipe states.

This cake is very moist and delicious.  I think it's the perfect coffee cake.  The only suggestion I have is to add more chocolate chips to the batter and also sprinkle them on top of the cake before baking.

Out of this world!!  The only change that I made was that I eliminated the nuts (due to a food allergy) and doubled the chocolate chips.  The kids, dh, and grandma gobbled it up! Thanks!

Great cake, easy to do (and that's from someone who is new at baking).  I doubled the amount of chocolate chips (which was definite bonus).  I would have preferred if I used brown sugar, but next time!  We ate it all quickly.

this is the best dessert to take to anyone, for anything.  I usually split it into two of the disposable square baking pans.  it freezes well also, I pull it out the night before to thaw - and have a breakfast treat ready in the morning!  I love that the recipe is fantastic as-is... no need to change this and that.

Nice.  Tasty and yes, reminiscent of a pound cake, but a bit better (IMO).  I made this for a birthday celebration at work, and there might have been one piece left at the end of the day, so I'm pretty sure my coworkers liked it a lot.  This is incredibly easy, even with the topping.  I had to bake an extra 25 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I think this is good? I made it in a slightly larger spring form about 10".  Since I was using a convect oven I baked for 48 mins, tooth pick came out clean. I cut it after cooling but still slightly warm. At first I thought it was under cooked but then realized it was the bottom that was wet,  like it had to much butter. Also the chips all sank to the bottom. Will coat in flour next time to prevent that. I used milk choco. chips and butterscotch.  Also swirled ever so slightly the topping into the batter which I used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar.

Wonderfully moist and great taste, but I would put this in a larger springform pan next time.  The outside and top were overdone, but the center was underdone and sank on cooling.  Also, I would pat the nuts into the batter, because when cutting pieces, the topping all fell off.  Definitely would make again though, as it's very easy!

Great recipe.  I added some almond extract and used slivered almonds on top (about 1/2 cup) along with extra chocolate chips.  I loved the variety of textures.  The creamy chocolate chips, the moist cake, and the crunchy top were a great combination.  I will make this again and again!

I only had 4 ounces of cream cheese instead of 8 but I made it anyway and it was SO GOOD! Everyone loved it. I didn't have nuts either so I just put cinnamon on top (no extra sugar).
I just made it again with no cream cheese but added about 1/4 cup of sour cream instead. Still deliciousness!

This is so delicious - I keep making it over and over again. My family likes it with chocolate chips and cocoa powder on top and my boyfriend likes the whole thing with nuts, instead of chocolate chips. Both versions are great!

This was a lovely moist cake and I have been asked for the recipe on many occasions. I have also had success using this recipe in two loaf pans rather than as one big cake. I like to make one loaf to take out and then I put the other loaf in the freezer. Also if I leave out the milk and do not put the topping on, this makes a scrumptious muffin. Thank you for such a versatile recipe!

This coffee cake is excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out really good, my only complain is that cooking it for 55 min. is a little too long in my oven, the pecans were a little burnt and the edge was a little crusty and brown so next time I'm going to start checking at 45 min. also I;m going to add a little butter and flour to the topping as I think that will make it even better, overall it came out delicious, I'm a cooffe cake girl and this is one that I'll be making often. Thanks Michelle for sumitting your recipe.Update: 07-06-09 I made this cake to send to a potluck at my hubbys workplace and it was gone in a few min. everybody loved it! even people from other dept. that didn't even know my husband came looking for the person that had bring the cofeecake, 6 different ladies were begging him to bring them the recipe, and I didn't even try the changes I suggested above:) Delicious!

I was looking for a recipe to take to a potluck and this was amazing! I doubled the recipe to make one for my mom to take to a potluck as well and everyone from both places loved it! I'm definitely making this again soon. The cinnamon mixed with the chocolate chips seemed strange to me before I tried this, but they combined perfectly. The texture of this cake is amazing, as well.

2/12/2011 - I just had to re-edit my review which I first did in 2009.  I got this recipe in the very very early 90's in my home economics class when I was in junior high.  My mom still has the original laminated in her recipe binder. HOWEVER, the only difference in this one is that it calls for 1 CUP of butter instead of my recipe which calls for 1 STICK.  I made this recipe the first time, as written, since I couldn't find my copy and something tasted different. I couldn't place my finger on it, but it was just not as well received as it had been in the past.   When I found my recipe, I compared it side by side and the ONLY difference is CUP vs. STICK of butter.  Um, well, if the one with less butter tastes better, well that's the one I'm going to stick with. This coffee cake is BY FAR the best best best thing ever (with one stick).  It's become a winter tradition for us. We made over and over every winter growing up (talk about lovely memories!) and now I make it for my family. It is sooo well received by everyone. I even give it as xmas gifts to my neighbors.  Anyways, try it with 1 STICK not Cup.  It's softer, moister, more tender and less "greasy."

Absolutetely amazing coffee cake!  My husband and daughter both commented that it tasted like something you'd get in a great little coffee shop/bakery, the kind that only exist in books and movies.  I can't have pecans (migraines!), so I left those out and sprinkled a few extra chocolate chips on top of the cake.  Next time (and there will be a next time for this recipe!), I'm going to try subbing some cocoa for some of the cinnamon on top.

Really good.  I love the richness that the cream cheese adds and all that butter, what more could you ask for? I took half to work and ended up passing out the recipe to everyone. I made a second cake and substituted cocoa powder for the cinnamon (I like CHOCOLATE!!!). It was even better.

I do not bake much, but wanted to give it a shot. This cake was absolutely one of the best I have ever had and so simple to make.( I followed the directions just as written ) My husband does not eat cake and had a few slices. I also like some of the other reviewers changes which I plan to try. Absolutely wonderful!!!!

Excellent coffee cake! As recommended by other reviewers, I beat the butter and cream cheese really well. The cake turned out moist and delicious and not too sweet. I took this to work and had 3 small slices left at the end of the day. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! I made this for the first time tonight as an experiment before taking to a work function later in the week. Rave reviews from my 3 guinea pigs and a definite recipe box keeper. Only adjustment - I added 2T flour to adjust for altitude. Yum.

The cake was delicious, although I highly recommend the following:

- serve cold...just out of the fridge.  The chips taste delicious that way.

- add 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips.  Some people said 2 cups which I found to be too much

- add half semi sweet chips and half milk chocolate - otherwise I found it a bit bitter.

Yum, yum, yum! This was a hit to everyone I have made it for. I only added more chocolate chips because, well, I love chocolate, but yes, this is a 10! Thank you so much for sharing!

Really good and easy to make. I put more chocolate chips on top instead of pecans because I always prefer chocolate to nuts. That also gave it a Mexican chocolate flavor with the cinnamon baking right into the chocolate. But DON'T wait until it's cool to eat it! So much better warm. And the next day I heated up my slice in the microwave 15 seconds. It did dry out a little the second and third days; warming it and adding some whipped cream helped.

I thought this was a good coffee cake, a bit different from the expected but didn't live up to the reviews in my mind.  Overall though a good recipe.  I used two 9" cake pans and baked for 35 minutes.

I made this cake for a group friends and it was a huge hit.  Gone in minutes!  It was easy to make and the taste and texture were perfect.  I did however have to bake it quite a bit longer than the recipe said.  That may just be my oven, but I baked it for probably closer to 70 minutes.  If you make this cake, just be sure to check it frequently for to see if it is done.  Mine was a still a little underdone in the middle, even with the extra time, but I would prefer it that way rather than overdone and dried out.  All in all, a delicious and moist coffee cake!

Good, family enjoyed, however was a little "heavy" for coffee cake.  Turned out like it should though.
