Easy to make and quite good. I made a few changes. I liked the suggestion about the microwave, so I steamed the chunks of cauliflower in the microwave until fork tender with about a half cup of vegetable broth - about 8-10 minutes. I added them to a food processor with a tablespoon of the liquid, a teaspoon each of garlic powder and white pepper, a tablespoon of salt and two tablespoons of butter. Processed until very similar to mashed potato. Then added a quarter cup of heavy cream and pulsed it a few more times.

This is a bit bland as is so you might want to take the submitters advice in the Footnotes. After tasting the cauliflower puree as is I added garlic salt and black pepper.

I had a head of cauliflower in my frig for a few weeks, and I decided to puree it & eat it later. I steamed it in a basket on the stove only added a little of the water,  some sea salt & 2 tbls butter. It was so delicious just like that! I wanted to eat the whole bowl, but had to force myself to save it for later. It was so tasty!! I can't imagine anyone not liking it.

Do NOT add any water! It makes it a watery mush. Pretty tasteless so I added garlic which helped. And some cheese.

The amount of water seemed excessive, and I preferred it with extra butter and some Italian parsley.

Thanks Nicholio! I added sauteed garlic, onion, butter, salt and pepper. I cooked the cauliflower for 15 minutes. My 40 year old blender is on the fritz so I pulled out my food processor and it worked very nicely. Although I reserved a cup of the Cauliflower water, I didn't need it as I didn't drain the C as much. Again thank you!

I made a few changes to this one. After I puréed the cauliflower I added it to a low heat and added a bunch of shredded cheese, garlic powder and minced garlic, and some salt and pepper. I kept adding these in until I got it to the taste I liked. Then I puréed it once more. Still a little grainy so I think I need to let it boil a bit longer next time before I purée it. But very simple and ate it for lunch with some butternut squash soup.

I didn't read the reviews before making this just now, and agree that as is I found it to be a bit bland, even after butter, salt & pepper. (I think I may have overcooked the cauliflower, a little, which probably didn't help.) But I loved how quick and simple it is, and I love cauliflower, so I'll definitely try it again using some of the other reviewers' suggestions to give it a deeper flavor.

Just make sure you season the water during the boil. I added half a lemon and salt to help give more flavor.

added fresh garlic, sliced onions, chicken broth anddd still meh. maybe because I didn't add butter it was missing that. The consistency wasn't very appealing. I'll probably experiment with it some more.

Easy peasy!  I added some garlic salt and green onions to zip up the taste a bit...then it became very tasty.
