We loved this recipe.  It was so simple to make.  I would suggest marinating chicken for at least 4 hours.  I used 3 zucchini and 1 yellow squash but definitely needed more zoodles- It must depend on the size of the squash. Next time I will use more fresh basil. There was plenty of lemon flavor without the added squirt of lemon. LastlyI, made sure my tomatoes were room temperature(I never refrigerate them) and sprinkled some fresh parmesan over each plate.

What a wonderful summertime dinner! The recipe was fresh-tasting and simple to make.  I agree that more basil would be good.  I had to use feta instead of ricotta, because that's what I had, but it worked out fine.  Next time, I think I'll toast 1/4 cup of pine nuts or walnuts for garnish.

This was delicious and easy. My picky family loved it and I did to.  I prepped the chicken in the morning and even spiralized the zucchini. Put it in separate zip lock bags. It was so easy when dinner time came around. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I will definitely make this again.  I appreciated that it was inexpensive and fairly easy to make. It had a fresh, clean, light taste that was unexpected for a cream sauce dish.  It was satisfying, but did not sit heavy on the stomach.   We paired it with a light red wine.  I wouldn't change the recipe much next time except maybe adding some black olives and thickening the sauce slightly.  It would have been delicious to have some breadsticks to dip in the leftover sauce... but we chose this dish specifically because we are cutting back on carbs like pasta and bread so I resisted the temptation.

This dish is so delicious.  If low carb diets consist of dishes like this one, I can handle this diet.
This recipe is perfect the way it is.

This was great. I didn’t have time to marinate, so I spiced up the chicken and cooked it. Added zucchini and broccoli to the chicken  and tomatoes and served it over Trader Joe’s lemon pappardelle pasta. With everything else I followed the recipe. Yummy!

I used two chicken breast instead of four. In addition to the marinade the recipe calls for I also put in lime juice, 5.5 oz tomato juice, and a little bit of white balsamic vinegar. I let the chicken sit in the marinade for 24 hours. Note when making zucchini noodles don't make them too long.

Liked all the ingredients but am sorry I didn't drain the zucchini after I heated it in the skillet. The accumulated moisture diluted the ricotta too much and lessened the flavor.

I give it generous 4 because I messed up and put way too much thyme in not seeing fresh until I had already put ground thyme in so that was pretty much all we tasted but it was still ok.  I will make again (correctly and maybe change my review.

As far as a zucchini dishes go, this is one of my favorites.  To save time, I used pre-spiraled zucchini from the grocery store.  I also substituted thin turkey cutlets, in place of the chicken breasts, because they cook in only 2-3 minutes.  I love that I can make the marinade in the morning and let the protein sit. 
 Then at dinner time, it took less than 10 minutes to cook on the stove top.  Next time I may bump up some of the herbs.

Made the recipe exactly as written. It was delicious. I put it in my special recipe file and plan to make it often.  I used the store bought pre-cut zucchini. It was so fast to make and low in carbs. I love that.

Love this! I just purchased a spiralizer and couldn't wait to use it.  Saw this recipe and hoped it was as good as it sounded and was not disappointed. I didn't realize I forgot the tomatoes until I was midway through my portion & added some diced up to the remainder on my plate and have to say it was delicious either way. The only changes  I made were using dried Italian Seasoning instead of the fresh herbs. Sorry I didn't measure how much ... just winged it,  but I did have fresh chives on hand. I used low fat ricotta & the juice of  only 1/2 a lemon in the sauce. I also added grated Parmesan on top before serving.  Even my picky husband enjoyed it! Will absolutely make again. OH...also I marinated for only about an hour because I didn't plan ahead of time and it turned out just fine.

This is good!  I calculated the calories at 486 per serving and that was using part skim ricotta.

Modified the recipe for two people, but used more zucchini based on others recommendation.  Don’t have a sprializer so used my mandolin to make zoodles. Marinated about 4 hours. Will try longer time next time. Very colorful dish. Tasted great.  Hubby  and I both liked it and will definitely make it again.

I didn't add the tomato as my daughter doesn't care for it and I added some extra red pepper flakes as we both like spice. It was delicious and SUPER easy to make.

This was amazing! Not a fan of lemon so omitted the last squeeze. However I did add the zest to the marinade.  Very filling and was raved about by a guest!

Not sure what I did wrong, but I found this pretty plain. I don't like chicken cooked in a pan on the stove (I find it rubbery), so I guess I should have known. The zoodles with ricotta were good, just not very exciting.

This was a very nice refreshing summer meal. I utilized many of the vegetables and herbs that I had in my garden.  Next time  I will not drizzle with lemon juice, as I felt that lemon zest added plenty of lemon flavor.  I will be making this again!
