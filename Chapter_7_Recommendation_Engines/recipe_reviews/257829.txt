Delicious! Keep a close eye on them because they will explode on you if you leave them  in too long. Serve with a side of marinara sauce and you won't be disappointed!

I loved this idea, because it would be so Keto-friendly.  However, one change.  Use coconut oil instead of grapeseed or vegetable oil.  The grapeseed or vegetable oil is actually unhealthy for you, creating inflammation that brings on the diseases that Keto prevents.  Otherwise, these are perfect for the Keto diet, with the low-carb, high protein cheese, the grain-free flours to coat them in, the protein in the eggs, as well.  A good coconut oil is able to withstand the higher heat to fry in (up to 450 degrees F), without imparting any flavor to the frying, but with lots of MCT oil benefits.
