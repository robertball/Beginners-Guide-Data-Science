I believe this is the Cornell recipe and it is very good.  However there is a warning about the sauce.  If you wish to use the extra sauce on the COOKED chicken, be sure to bring the sauce to a boil. The raw eggs are the reason to cook the sauce.

Extremely easy to prepare and not necessary to use a blender or processor, as long as you mix by hand really well.  The vinegar and eggs make a nice contrast, making the chicken quite flavorful.  Slightly salty to the taste, it is not recommended for people who want to cut back on their sodium intake.  I would recommend cutting the vinegar back maybe to 3/4 cup.

We thought this sauce was great, it was very similar to the chicken bbq's at local events.  We will use it again soon.  I would cut back on the salt though.

Funny -- my name is Dorothy and I had a recipe almost exactly like this from my former mother-in-law!  Glad I found this to remind how to make it.  I always make a lot more: 1 c. oil, 2 c. white vinegar, 1/2 box of poultry seasoning, 2 eggs, garlic and black pepper and usually a good splash of beer.  I boil it on the stove and then let it cool.  I also sometimes parboil the chicken to save time, then marinate, then charcoal grill.

This is an excellent recipe!  Do not change a thing.  Those that left low stars were expecting tradition bbq sauce which this is not. This marinade is perfect just the way it is.  Do not substitute the oven for the grill...or you will be dissapointed.  Nice flavor for the whole family.  My 6 year old and teens like it and they are picky.  We don't think this is too salty and think it would be lacking if left out.

Fantastic! Just like the Cornell or "white" chicken bbq sauce we discovered upon moving from red-bbq-sauce country to rural upstate NY. The Cornell recipe calls for gently heating the sauce since it's often made in bulk prior to the big event. All summer long one can smell wonderful fumes from the chicken bbq picnics and fundraisers -- fire depts, lodges, churches, scouts and charities! I made this sauce using the AR recipe for poultry seasoning, tossed a Ziploc bag filled with sauce and chicken into a very cold fridge for 2 hrs; used reserved sauce to baste grilling chicken. Everything must be cooked to a very safe temperature. My belief system regarding barbeque sauces: all good, some better.

This is absolutely the most divine marinade for chicken.  Marinade overnight and it will melt in your mouth.  I was so wary when I started it because of the color and smell (all that vinegar), but it is so scrumptious.  2 thumbs up :)

I am one of the few who didn't find this recipe to be too great.   I guess I like my barbecue sauce to be thick and stay on the meat, rather than be soup.

Marinated for 1-1/2 hr., but I think it would be best to marinate overnight (if possible), as I didn't get too much of the marinade flavor.  The chicken browned nicely at about 35 minutes and it was moist,  but the flavor was lacking just a bit...but was still good.

This is the chicken recipe that I got from my uncle, the fireman. It is the one the local firemen used at their dinners. Small world. And great chicken.

Like the last reviewer Dorothy, this is an old family recipe and I am here to find it.  My wife, another Dorothy, has this and many of my mothers other recipes written down in a small notebook.  Unfortunately I can't find it, Dorothy is at work, and I want to prepare this for a picnic at a beach park here in Hawaii after I pick D up from work.  This is an excellent recipe as is.  Growing up in northwestern PA as a kid, my father used to shovel a path through the snow to prepare this on his grill.  He used to cook half chickens, and yes we would all eat a full half.  Today I usually use split breasts.  The only disadvantage to them is the skin often peels back.  It's not good for you, but that is where much of the flavor is.  My family never marinated the chickens, but I do now sometimes if time permits.  There is not a lot of difference.  We also pre-bake the chicken covered with foil for about 30 to 45 minutes at 350 to reduce the grilling time.  That also reduces the fat content in the chicken, so "fire control" at the grill is less time consuming and saves more beer for me.

BBQ Sauce was nice.  I used boneless chicken breast and it did just fine.

Delicious, we put the chicken on the grill and basted it as directed, changed nothing. This taste exactly like the kind of chicken barbeque they sell in the summer! Our neighbors agree also!

I think this should just be called marinade instead of BBQ sauce, but it is FABULOUS no matter what you call it.  I used olive oil (that's what I had), added some hot sauce, and added an extra egg (for no reason except my gut said "use another egg!!).  I mixed it by hand, and marinated chicken thighs for about 4-5 hours.  YUM!

This was very good!! The only change I made was I threw in a couple of garlic cloves when I blended the sauce.  I used skinless bonless chicken breast. I marinated them for 2 hours in the sauce.  They were jucy with great flavor (even inside the chicken not just the outside) This one is a keeper!! Thanks

This didn't really have a taste. I'm sorry maybe I did something wrong. Although I followed the recipe exactly. And I marinated the chicken for over 2 hrs. My husband thought the skin tasted okay, but I guess we are just used to big bold BBQ sauces. Thanks anyway.

This is the fireman's chicken bbq recipe. I would double the poultry seasoning and the pepper. The salt looks about right, maybe a little less. It's not as good with boneless, skinless breasts but with split chicken breasts, it is great. Oh, with a potato salad, a feast

What a great find!  I thought this was just fantastic.  I cut down on the salt, but followed the recipe as written.  As the recipe calls for, I marinated the chicken for an hour and used some reserved sauce for basting while it was on the grill.  Can't wait to make this for friends!

I have tweeked this recipe to suit our taste. Omit the eggs, increase the vinegar to 1 qt, veg oil to 1 pt, 1/2 c salt, 1/8 c poultry seasoning, 2T garlic powder and pepper. Warm vinegar and salt until salt is dissolved, add remaining ingredients, pour warm sauce over chicken and soak for at least 24 hours, 48 is better.  The salt is what makes the sauce soak into the chicken, if you are sensitive to salt use Morton's NO Salt, it tastes the same. Slow cook on charcoal grill, gas grills will flare up more that charcoal.

Very good and easy to make.  I used it to marinade the chicken and reserved some to baste during cooking.  I only let it marinate for a couple of hours, I think in the future I would let it sit overnight in the fridge.

OMG!!!! I tried this recipe with the most fussy of people.....my daughter and....woot woot....success!!! I did not have cider vinegar and had to use regular vinegar and I added a tablespoon of fresh garlic......The best!!
