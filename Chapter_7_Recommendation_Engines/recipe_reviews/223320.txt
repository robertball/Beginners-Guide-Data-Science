This was OK but bland. Needed more coconut milk more lemon and maybe more pepper flakes. My husband didn't like the unwilted arugala better if you toss it in with the hot pasta and let it wilt.

This was just okay. I Wasn't a huge fan of the flavor of this sauce. A little too acidic and not the nice creaminess I was hoping for with the coconut milk I would say the lemon is the dominant flavor. The whole family ate it but not something we will make again. I did add some shredded carrot and cucumber to the bed of salad and I liked the idea of a warm noodle dish over salad. It had a nice fresh feeling for a pasta dish.

I used a full can of coconut milk. Poured the sauce over leftover pasta and let stand for 15 minutes. Topped with fresh prawns. Awesome!

Fresh easy and a great way to repurpose leftover chicken. I used the entire 12 oz. can of coconut milk and added in chopped straw mushrooms with the bean sprouts for extra flavor. I winged the herbs and it still came out amazing. It has a creamy lemon basil taste to it with good bite from al dente spaghetti and the straw mushrooms. I would recommend this to anyone that loves lemon.

Great for leftover chicken- needed more salt.
