A friend brought a version of this to a dinner party as an appetizer, she also added a little mozarella and parmesan cheese, it was a hit! It really looks pretty if you top it with the cheeses and then lay big slices of fresh tomato over the top.

Very tasty! My first dish using pesto and it turned out great! My hubby & 3 yr old loved it! Inexpensive (and quick!) to make if you use the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust (also on this site - I will be adding a tblsp. or so of Italian herbs to the dough before baking next time).

Yum!  Everyone in my family loved this pizza - even the ones who don't like feta cheese.  The only changes were... I made my own dough with some oregano and garlic salt added, I used orange bell pepper instead of green, and tomato basil feta.  This one is definitely going in my recipe box!

Out Of This World Delicious!!  It smelled so good while baking in the oven, and tasted even better.  I used some homemade pesto from my basil plants - - nice and garlicky.  There is nothing I would change on this recipe....it's perfect.

I loved this recipe...yes, a bit on the expensive side, but totally worth it! I like adding some sunflower seeds for a bit more crunch.

Quick, easy, and a nice twist on "same-o, same-o" boring pizza.  Pesto gives a wonderful "gourmet" flavor.

This was sooo good!  I think as long as you use good pizza dough and pesto, it is impossible to make this recipe any less than a five-star one!  I used my homemade dough and homemade pesto the way my family likes it, topped it with artichokes, olives, and thin slices of tomatoes, as well as feta and some mozzerella, and we all loved it!  Great recipe!

Make pizza dough in bread maker - adding about 1T of italian seasoning.  Baked while oven was heating plus additional 4-5 min.  Added toppings:  basil pesto, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, onions, and entire mozzarella ball shredded.  Baked for 10 minutes.  Came out absolutely perfect.

Easy and excellent! I'm not a cook by any stretch, but my wife was hurt and I was forced to take up the cooking duties for the next 4 months. This was one of the easiest and tastiest things I made, and for a novice like me, it garnered 5 stars from my wife!

The amount of toppings this recipe calls for is enough for two pizzas and it took about 20 minutes to cook.  My friends and I made it and the feta would not melt.  We thought this recipe would be much improved if we had used less toppings and saut√©ed the vegetables.  We also felt that it would be wiser to use mozzarella and Parmesan instead of feta, as the feta seemed to overpower everything.  We also made our own dough instead of using the pre-baked kind.

This is REALLY outstanding! You could probably make two pizzas with this amount of toppings. The only thing I added was a drizzle of olive oil over top before baking. Thanks!

Good way to use up an abundant basil & tomato crop ... Used the "easy pesto" from this site (lowered the sodium) & fresh black olives (never from a can). 
Put these ingredients onto a pita and baked at 425 for 20 minutes - let stand 5 minutes to cool and this was a five.  I've rated it a 4 as written.

Someone complained that this was expensive to make - I disagree, I think that if you make your own crust it's fairly inexpensive for a fun/creative meal.  I would use goat cheese next time, though - a little too many salty foods at once with the feta.

Taste is ok but could be better possibly with a different cheese (one that melts)..The feta stays clumpy and doesn't get the slightest bit soft.

Good idea, great flavor, quick and easy.  Much better than ordering out.  We added more cheese than directed and that seemed to add it.   Also put basil leaves under some of the cheese.

I don't know how one could call this pizza a disappointment! This is exceptional, and a must have for any recipe collection. I sometimes use sundried tomatoes rather than the red bell pepper, but either way it's delicious!

Excellent recipe!  Unique combination of ingredients make this a flavorful and impressive pizza... but so easy and quick to make.  Use it to wow friends and family!  A pizza stone will greatly enhance the texture of the crust.  This recipe will be a staple in our house!

My husband and I thought this pizza was great. Very flavorful, and quick since there wasn't anything that I had to cook prior to putting all the ingredients onto the pizza. This is one of the more expensive pizzas to make so this wouldn't be one that I would make on a regular basis, but as a treat every once in a while it's great! I loved the pesto as the sauce for something different instead of using a tomato based sauce. Thank you for the recipe, SKWms!

This was a good recipe.  I didn't measure things exactly since I was just putting the toppings on and seeing what looked right for our taste so I can't say if the toppings were too plentiful as others reported.  I thought it was a good balance just going by sight.  For my personal taste, next time I'll use more pesto and maybe add some  garlic powder or salt to give it a kick.  I did add a little bit of mozzarella after reading about some complaints of melted cheese.  It was good too.  A very good base recipe to spring from if you desire.

Great alternative to "regular" pizza.  You can't go wrong with Pesto.  I did try to keep the recipe the same, but I don't like olives or artichoke hearts, so I added sliced tomatoes in addition to the diced (as in another review).  I also added basil, per another reviewer as well.  It turned out great.  Even my 2 year old had a second slice!  Yum.

Made it the first time and thought it was good, but for the 2nd time, I made a couple of revisions and it was delicious!!! My boyfriend thought it was much better than any restaurant pizza.  I made fresh pesto sauce using roasted garlic, basil, walnuts, olive oil, Parmesan. I used Digourno crust, a much better crust than the cheaper one I originally tried. Did not add bell peppers or onions, but did add in spinach and mozzarella cheese.

I also had this on the quick and easy pizza crust, which I cooked for about 10 minutes before adding the toppings. I also added some squares of mozzarella. I don't usually like cold leftover pizza, but I was super excited to have this in my lunch the next day and it was excellent cold too!!

I thought the pesto gave this pizza plenty of flavor !!!  It wasn't bland at all.  Since feta isn't my husband's fave I used mozzarella.  A keeper for us !!!

Aweaome! I did add some baby bella mushrooms and a little sprinkle of parmesan on top of the feta.  I used my pwn recipe for the pesto. I grow my own herbs and this was so fresh. I will definitely make this again.

My go-to pizza recipe. I usually omit the artichoke hearts - they're a little expensive and I don't think they add that much flavor to the pizza. Tip from my sister - mix all the vegetables and feta together in a bowl, then spread on top of the pesto. It's faster and you end up with a very even distribution of toppings, but you do miss out on the fun of sprinkling them all over :)

Fantastic!  Didn't change the ingredients at all but was just generous with the pesto sauce.  SO easy to make!  I chopped up all the ingredients and my 2 year old loved helping me to assemble the pizza...then ate a ton of it! Will make again for sure.

Great combination - I didn't change a thing.  The one thing I'd suggest is that if you start with unbaked pizza dough, like I did, either pre-bake it (I forgot) or go easy on the oil in your pesto - our pizza was a bit soggy.  Totally my fault, though.  We'll make this a lot!

So Delicious! Beautiful pizza, picture perfect.The posted pic doesn't do this one justice, it looks so much better. Oh and you should smell it! This smelled great as it was baking. I didn't have any green peppers so I just left them off, but I found some baby spinach in the fridge and added that in it's place. I used a handful of snipped sun dried tomatoes as I didn't have a fresh tomato on hand. I used a mediterranean blend cheese crumbles (feta, provolone, parmesan) Very very good and I will make this one again. I think I'll try fresh mozarella and mushrooms as well the next time I make this. Pizza Hut sure doesn't make 'em like this!

I used straight up goat cheese and some roasted garlic in addition to the other toppings and it was REALLY good.  My dough was too thick (my fault), but had I made thin crust, this would have been THE BOMB!  We have a pizza place here that sells pizza similar to these for $16/small!  Thanks for saving us money!

Best pizza I've ever had!  I layered with what I had on hand, fresh mozz slices instead of feta and topped with chunky pepperoni, slices of roma tomatoe, black olives and lastly hand grated romano cheese.  Baked until the edges were crispy.  I made on an 8in boboli crust with 2 "ice cubes" of my own frozen pesto.  I may never use pizza sauce again!

This is a big hit with my husband! He loves the fresh flavor and this is the perfect recipe for a light summer pizza. I now keep artichoke hearts, black olives, packaged thin crusts,pesto,(basil and sun dried tomato) and feta in the house (and I always have tomatoes, peppers, and red onions on hand) for a quick "go to" recipe that I know he will enjoy.

This pizza was delicious.  I omitted the onion, substituted goat cheese for feta and rep pepper for green and used the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe found on this site.  I will definitely make this again.

This is really not as good as chain pizza restaurant products.  The pesto overpowers the artichoke hearts.

This was great. We used a ton of the vegetables; it was almost comical how high the toppings were on the pizza. We had to cook it a little longer than it said, but that's not a big deal. It was also pretty filling due to all the veggies...A nice guilt free pizza!

Can't imagine anyone NOT loving this.  I made my own 14" crust and didn't prebake.  Sauteed 10 Baby Bella mushrooms with the pepper and used sliced Roma tomatoes on the top.  Used about 10 Greek olives instead of canned and my homemade pesto.  Gave it a delicious punch.  Cooked about 15 minutes since the crust wasn't cooked first.  Spectacular.  Thanks for this.

My family loved this!  You could probably make two pizzas with this amount of toppings though.  I used mozarella cheese (because that is what I had on hand).  I left out the green bell pepper and the onion because I had everything on hand except those ingredients and I didn't feel like running to the store.  Also, my boys like "MEAT" on their pizza so we added pepperoni.  Turned out great.  Everyone loved it!   Easy recipe!   ;-)

This pizza is delicious! I used homemade pesto and homemade pizza crust. I felt there was too much feta on the pizza, however, so next time I may cut the amount of cheese. This pizza does take some time to make if you have to chop up fresh veggies, so I wouldn't be able to make it on a weeknight. It was fine for a weekend meal.

I have never tried Pesto pizza before and I must say that it was a great change from the regular! I used spelt flour instead of bread flour and had to add a 1/2 cup of additional flour just because it was a bit moist. I also used some mozzarella cheese along with the feta and it turned out wonderfully! I will most definitely be making this one again, thanks a lot!

Easy and excellent!  We used Kalamata olives and omitted the tomato and green pepper (none on hand).  Doubled up on the artichokes and it was marvelous.  We even used WalMart pre-made crust and it was better than the higher priced 'brand' name-- who knew?  We'll be making again!!

I loved it and so did my family.  We used the veggies we liked green and yellow peppers and a red onion.  We also added chicken that I cooked ahead of time and it was great.  I used the feta and italian blend preshredded cheese.

I've made many versions of pesto pizza, and my fav is simple: flatbread or wraps, pesto, and chopped yellow, red, and orange peppers. It's quick, easy, and it's yummy.

We thought the artichoke overpowered the flavor profile of the pesto base.  Also, I added some mozzarella cheese to melt it all together.

I wasn't paying attention and bought the bigger cans of olives and artichoke hearts.  Mine turned out looking like a mountain instead of a pizza.  The flavor was good, but the edges burned before the feta browned.  I think that was my screw up from too many olives and artichokes.  Basically I ended up with a pretty good artichoke salad with bread on the bottom.  I would make it again though--may the right way this time.  My only complaint is that I really feel it's stretching it calling it a pizza--maybe I'm set in my ways, but I think any pizza I have I want a tomato sauce taste to it.

Excellent taste. I made my own pesto with the basil from my garden. You can also add whatever veggies or protein you have available. I had some salmon steaks so I cut thing slices and put those on as well as the peppers, red onion, artichoke hearts. I also used pieces of fresh mozzarella as well as some grated parm. Overall flavor very good and a great way to use leftover items for a delicious dinner.

I was looking for something to do with the pesto sauce and left over gorgonzola in my fridge and this recipe hit the spot.  Between my fridge and pantry I had all the ingredients all ready so it didn't cost a dime.  I replaced the feta with the gorgonzola and just used less.  Worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really delicious simply recipe.  I made this on fresh baked focaccia using a fresh spinach basil pesto.  I added chicken for added substance, but feel it would have tasted just as good without.  I only gave it 4 stars because I don't think it would have been as tasty using store bought bread and/or pesto from a jar.  That's just my opinion.

Loved it even though I ended up not having artichokes, tomatoes, or olives. I used frozen onions and frozen green peppers. I also didn't much feta left, so I used mozzarella. I also used a whole grain crust. My 6 yr old tried a bite and said yuck but I thought it was great.

This pizza turned out awesome!! This recipe is a definite keeper! However I made a few revisions and let me tell you they were well worth it! I basically added 2 extra toppings--sliced kalamata olives and roasted eggplant slices (I roasted them in the oven previously for about 5 minutes with salt, pepper, and olive oil). These two additional toppings definitely kicked it up a notch and made this pizza unforgettable!

This was definitely fast and easy, which is my first test, but the feta didn't melt (I suspected it wouldn't).  May try the other reviewer's suggestion of adding mozzarella and parmesan cheese to melt in and hold all the toppings together.  The family was not overly excited, and it rated, "I guess I'd eat it again, but don't go out of your way".  My son skipped it altogether.

Great pizza but I had to use what was in my fridge!  I had parm cheese, yellow onions and red bell pepper, a can of olives and I only bought a tomato. I did a saut√© of onion, bell pepper and added crushed garlic. I made my own dough in the bread maker, rolled the dough in small portions, spread the pesto sauce, added the veggies and cheese, and put small pizzas on a stone at 500 degrees for 10 minutes.  Perfect!

I don't know why I never thought of using pesto as a pizza sauce before this.  I loved it with the onion and the olives (Kalamata) and the peppers (banana).   I had to omit the artichoke hearts, finding that I didn't have a can in the pantry after starting the pizza.  I tossed on some cooked chicken instead, but I love artichoke hearts and know they would be an excellent addition to this.  I used a French feta which is much creamier than a Greek or Bulgarian feta and it did a wonderful job of melting.  I baked the pizza for 6 minutes, then added a handful of shredded Parmesan on top and baked another 3 minutes.  I rarely follow the amounts listed in pizza recipes, preferring to eyeball ingredients and ratios to our tastes.  This is not something to eat often - but as an occasional change of pace it is delightful.

Delicious. I sliced thin red and green peppers the onions and the artichokes, (rather than dice) did not use olives as my husband and I do not like them, sprinkled grated parm cheese over the pesto spread and also a thin layer of shredded mozza cheese. I baked it for about 25 minutes with the pizza crust directly on the oven rack, rotating it every 8 minutes or so. Very fresh tasting, will be making it soon again and trying other veggies to top it with. Thank you for sharing!

This was very good.  The only thing I changed was I used my own pizza dough instead of the pre-made.

I found this recipe on allrecipes quite a while ago and have made it several times.  It's foolproof and delicious! Perfect for a quick dinner or lunch.  I've used both jarred pesto and the Knorr packaged mix. Both work well for this recipe, but I prefer the jarred as it is a little thicker.

I left off the tomatoes because my boyfriend hates them & the peppers because I didn't feel like dicing one.  Added a little mozzarella & parmesan...delightful!  Loved it

We didn't use the onion because I didn't have one. We also put some Italian cheeses on top of it all. The feta was fine too.  We really enjoyed this.

Delicious, the flavors work well together, a new favorite for dinner for my husband and I. My mom shared leftovers the next day and her exact words were "simply delicious" This was very easy to make as well.

My husband and I both loved this!  The artichoke hearts really add to the flavor.  We'll be making this again.
