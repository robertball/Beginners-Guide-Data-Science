OMG! So odd, but so good! Sometimes some of the strangest food pairings turn out to be really tasty. This was a great combination of sweet & salty. I used whole wheat bread and grilled my sandwich to get my peanut butter a bit melty and used Granny Smith Apples. I say don't knock it 'til ya try it!

Peanut butter and Bacon sandwiches are a staple for me and I like the crunchy addition of apples!  Thanks for posting this classic, at least a classic in my house.  I like mine on buttered and toasted wheat bread.

Excellent! I used whole wheat, put pb on both slices of bread to hold things together - and I probably used more of everything. Thanks!! :)

My husband found this recipe in a magazine and tried it as a last minute alternative.  To be honest, I thought it sounded a bit gross.  Our recipe used smoked apple bacon and adding peach jam.  Also,  I suggest using Texas toast.  The thicker sliced bread prevents it from getting soggy after grilling it.  We are huge fans of this recipe!  It is one of our favorites.

I tried this with bananas instead of apple since I'm not a big fan of apples and I LOVE bananas with peanut butter.  I thought it was good, but nothing special. The bacon took away from the peanut butter flavor too much for me to rank this a 5.  I need to taste my PB!

This recipe was intriguing to me.  Simple and a bit off the beaten path (which I truly like--who wants normal all the time?), so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  I didn't exactly follow the recipe completely for a few reasons.  I don't usually have or like white bread, so I used the pb and jelly bread I'd just made.  I also only have bacon crumbles, not bacon, so I mixed some crumbles with pb and used that as the spread on both sides of the bread, then put the apples in the middle.  I like it; the savory flavor of bacon goes well with peanut butter, and the apples add some sweetness.  I can't say if the bf would like this, but it works as a simple lunch for me.  Thanks!

These are really good! I make mine on toasted English muffins.  Often substitute Canadian bacon for the regular bacon.  I know this is going to make the combination sound even stranger, but a thin slice of onion will really add more zip to this sandwich and tastes a lot better than it probably sounds.

Bacon, apple PB, where have you been my whole life?! This was love at first sight, and yes it was delicious too! This sandwich will be good morning, noon and night! I used thin cut Honeycrisp.

I have been making this recipe for years, but without the apple. Peanut butter and bacon are a great match, even though it may seem a bit odd. Will try it with apples, maybe even with a pear!

This was a good sandwich, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would.  My apple kind of got lost in it.  Perhaps if it would have been sweeter it would have been more noticeable.  I will definitely be trying the recipe again, as I think it's a great combo!  Thanks for sharing, krschumm!!

These are definitely worth trying even if they sound different. The flavors work well together; next time I'm going to put some thinly sliced onion on them.
