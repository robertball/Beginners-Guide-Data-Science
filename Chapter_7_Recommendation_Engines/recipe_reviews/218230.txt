Hi, Dad! We thought this was a pretty good start, and something we would love to try again. I made this recipe to the letter, and I think next time I will go for some slight changes. First, the oil content seems excessive. I might just use a tablespoon of olive oil for browning the roast and forgo all of the additional oil. Also, I think I will use about half of the soy sauce. The pasta seemed to soak up more of the flavors than the roast did, which was fine, but it seemed that I could have made twice as much as indicated. My picky three year old keeps "mmm"-ing at the table, and my 1 year-old is gobbling up the carrots. Over all, a good weekday meal.

All of that soy and worcestershire sauce make the broth so salty that the macaroni was inedible.  Also, way too much lemon juice and garlic

I love this recipe I'm on HCG now so I didnt' add any oil, or sugars  or added vegies -and this is EXCELLENT.  For my family I would add carrots, potatos, and onion.
NO: Worcestershire sauce, (sugar) lemon juice (i forgot it), or added oil ( infact I would skimm the cooled broth before storing it becuase there was plenty of fat from the beef).  I used 5 cups of vegie broth (Seitenbacher Vegetarian Vegetable Broth -gluten, dairy, etc free) because I didn't have beef broth, Braggs (1/4) instead of Soy sauce, no carrots or pasta. I think the pasta in the pot would be Extreemly salty  and would recomment cooking seperatly.  I also added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and a few grinds of my "McCormics Steakhouse seasoning GRINDER".  I browned the roast in a cast iron skillet before i put it in the crock pot, then added the liquid and seasonings, gave it a stir and about 3-4 hours later I had the BEST most TENDER roast that just fell apart with a fork.  I have been eating it with very thinly slice cucumber for the last few days. The only chane I would make is to reduce the Braggs Liquid Aminos futher to 2-3 TBS as it was a little salty. P.s  I am making this for Sunday dinner for my family!  YUMMY

Not bad.  I left out the lemon juice (knew bf wouldn't like) 1 tbs of the garlic powder, and the soy sauce.  I just felt it would be too salty that way.  The pasta didn't cook very well--not sure why, but perhaps it was our pasta that was the problem (it came from bf's grandmother's house and who knows how old it is).  I also used only enough olive oil to brown the meat, then eliminated the rest and added some 2 cups of water to account for the liquid I left out.  I didn't bother putting it into the food processor but used the same pan I used to brown the meat and deglazed it with the broth, water, and spice mixture, which worked well.  I cooked on low from 9 am to about 5, then added the veggies, although with baby carrots you really can add them sooner (not with the meat, of course, but sooner) than with other veggies.  The roast was falling off the bone by the time it was done, which was perfect since it can be a tough piece of meat.  The pasta does soak up the flavor of the sauce, so make sure you like it!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious! Totally forget that I wanted to make this and had to defrost my roast in the microwave and cooked this on high in my slow cooker for about 5 hours and it still came out so tender, it was like slicing butter!
