Great dish. My boss has traveled the country and says these were the best he'd had.  I added personal seasonings to the VERY FINELY crushed chips.  Black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of nutmeg.  Cooked the scallops at 425 until they weren't opaque any longer.  Broiled to turn the chips on top golden.  Delish!! Thanks.

I'm new to allrecipies.  I am also alone since my husband passed and I like to eat.  So I went looking for recipes - easy and for one - and discovered allrecipies. 

I love the fact that we can get a scaling version of each recipe and was very interested in this particular recipe because there are only two ingredients and it's super easy.

I used Cape Cod Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper Potato Chips (my favorite) and this was so good.  You can't beat super easy and super tasty.

Thanks littleone for sharing this recipe.

The only saving grace of this dish is that it's scallops, which are pretty tasty by themselves. My girlfriend (this account) asked why I was abusing the poor scallops with the potato chips.

Unfortunately, this is the recipe I made for my husbands and father in laws  first try at scallops.  It was a dismal failure.  I love scallops and this did nothing for them.  They were very bland, and well not that appetizing, and I love scallops.  I saved all the untouched ones, and had them as left overs for myself after pan frying in garlic butter sauce, but alas the guys would not touch them.  Very dissappointing.

These were OK, but a little bland.  Next time, I think I'll dip the scallops in a bit of egg and milk to hold the chips on better.  I added a bit of white pepper and Old Bay to my finely crushed chips, but I think I should have added a lot more, considering the volume of chips; at least a teaspoon of white pepper and half a tablespoon of Old Bay next time.  We'll see if that improves it.

Loved these but I think you need to turn the 2 ingredients into 3. I thought I had sea scallops in the freezer but they ended up being bay scallops. I proceeded with the recipe anyway and they were good but after 20 minutes they were done but not brown. I tasted them at this step and they were good BUT at this point I sprinkled them with Old Bay and stuck them under the broiler for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes under the broiler the chips browned up nicely and the Old Bay Season was a huge plus! Squeeze a wedge of fresh lemon over the scallops and you have a 5 star all the way! Can't wait to try this again with the sea scallops.
