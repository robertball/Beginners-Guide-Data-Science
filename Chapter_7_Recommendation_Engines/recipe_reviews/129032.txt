I made this exactly as directed and it was hands down one of the prettiest things I've ever made. It's truly a beautiful looking dessert. It's tasty though it bit sweet and I wish that there was a little something salty or buttery to balance it. The apricot flavor really dominates and the sugar on the crystallized ginger doesn't melt or have the best texture. I would absolutely make this again with a few tweaks.

Made the recipe as is and the white chocolate with the ginger was just too sweet and overwhelming in ginger flavor. Its just not the kind of thing we'd pack for a hike or take camping, its just too sweet.

I love anything with dried fruit in it but the ginger overwhelmed all the other flavours. I would make it again if I could find a way to create a proper fudge texture but it was very sticky and too soft

Just okay, not a keeper.  Crystallized ginger costs nearly $9 for 2 ounces, so I used only 1 ounce, (about 2 Tbs) and I would not have liked the full amount anyway.  I think the white chocolate should not be added to the hot pan the evaporated milk and sugar were cooked because the pan is hot enough to scorch the chocolate and may be why mine seemed a little dry.

I have made this since it first appeared in USA Weekend.  This is very good fudge, and very pretty with the green nuts, red cranberries and orange apricots.  Although I love candied ginger, it did not appeal to me in this recipe so I left it out.  I make sure to use roasted/salted pistachios to balance the sweetness of the fudge.  I also use a mix of Turkish apricots (also called Mediterranean), which are sweet, and California apricots, which are tart.
