4.26.16  If you're planning to make this in advance, I can certainly see why you'd want to get the excess moisture out and go through the procedure outlined in the instructions.   I had this for lunch today, cut it up, added the poppy seed dressing, and I had no problem with watery dressing.  Nice little salad, certainly like the way this one breaks nutritionally.   Thanks for sharing.
