Great recipe for PB and chocolate lovers!  Very easy to make.  Didn't have any Peanut Butter and Milk Chocolate Chips.  Used 11 ounces of dark chocolate instead (cut into small chunks).  Added a couple of extra tablespoons of PB to compliment the chocolate. Husband ate 10 in one sitting! Will make them again.

I liked this recipe but found the dough to be too dry after mixing.  I added 2 TBSP milk to the dough and this helped (I doubled the recipe).  I also used Reeses premier baking pieces - mini peanut butter cups rather than the suggested choco/peanut butter chips suggested.  The kids loved these.

I was excited to try this recipe, but was a little disappointed.  I didn't make any alterations to this recipe.  When my timer went off, I opened the over expecting to see yummy yummy cookies ready to be taken out.  Insead, I saw 12 mounds looking exactly the same as I last saw them when I put them in- I had used my cookie scoop and all the cookies were still in the "scoop" shape.  Yes, my oven was on.  I used the back of the scoop to flatten them out a little, and then they looked better, but they weren't near done yet.  I baked them a little longer and took them out.  With the next batch to go in the oven, i flattened them right away.  Both sets turned out dry.  Not the best cookie I've ever made, but they're not terrible.  Even though I'm sure they'll get eaten up, I don't think I'll try this recipe again.

A very good cookie.  Spreads very little.  Nice texture.  Truly a cross between a peanut butter cookie and a chocolate chip.  I found that I needed to bake them the entire 14 minutes.

These did not taste very peanut buttery.  It made 36 VERY small cookies, and the dough did not expand much after being baked.  Despite all this, they still tasted very good and I will make them again.
