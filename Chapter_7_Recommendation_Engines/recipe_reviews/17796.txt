My boyfriend, who is a picky eater, liked this recipe as did I!  I stuffed the cavity with the lemon and leeks per the recipe but I also threw in some minced garlic and poultry seasoning.  I also used the poulty seasoning on the outside of the and added some olive oil.  Halfway through cooking, I milted a teaspoon of butter and gently brushed the top of the cornish hens.  I cooked untill the internal temperature reached 180 degrees.  The meat was tender and juicy...not to mention elegant.  I served with Saffron Rice and Broccoli.

This was a great basic recipe!  To suit my owns tastes, I substituted fines herbes for the poultry seasoning, and added a dash of olive oil and some minced garlic.  Also, rubbing the birds with the herbs enhances the flavor.  And brushing the birds with butter during the roasting results in lovely golden skins.  
And if you're feeding any vegetarians, usig the marinade to broil portabellas results in a delicious entree my boyfriend raved over.

This was a great recipe! I followed it exactly, and my mother and I both thought that the hens were delicious. Pretty easy, considering that I'm not the most advanced cook. Thanks!

These were great, but I did have to add a bit more seasonings to them...  In the cavity I salt and peppered and added the poultry seasoning before I put in lemon and leeks.  On the outside I rubbed with evoo then the poultry seasonings and sprinkled with garlic powder and dried rosemary... I placed on a bed of lemon and leeks as another reviewer suggested.  Even the breast meat was juicy after cooking 1 1/2 hours.  The whole family thought they were great and looked elegant!.. ** Picture was taken before I realized they weren't done enough; I baked another 30 minutes and the skin browned nicely!

I used this recipe and the other reviews as a guideline. I made a herb and garlic infused butter (Rosemary, sage, thyme and parsley) and coated the cavity before seasoning with salt, pepper and stuffing with lemon and leeks. I made a layer of sliced lemon and leeks in the bottom of the pan with what I had left over. I sprinkled the poultry seasoning, salt, pepper and the zest of one lemon on the outside of the hens and sprinkled with fresh parsley. I basted more of the butter several times during the cook process, which was more like an hour and a half. The end result was flavorful, moist and fantastic! Will definitely make again!

Thank you so much!  This is a delicious and easy recipe. I added more poultry seasoning, so it "coated" both hens.  I think the hens I used were on the big side, so I cooked them for almost an hour and a half at 350 F.  It was a hit with my partner, and I will cook it again!

My boyfriend is mainly a beef eater - but he keeps asking me to make this recipe! Very tasty! I prepared it exactly the way the recipe called for...but will try some of the other suggestions such as rubbing with herbs and butter. Thanks!

This was perfect for an intimate Christmas dinner!  My husband and I had his best friend over and they both devoured the hens.  The only thing is that I forgot to get lemons, but it still tasted great!

The was really good. I forgot to by leeks, so I tucked thinly sliced garlic under the skin, and put rosemary in the cavity. Yum.

Very tasty recipe - I recommend using a healthy dosing of seasoning. One tablespoon wasn't enough so I just sprinkled a bunch on.

I'm only a beginner cook and this recipe left me uninspired.  The flavors were not strong enough and next time I make Cornish Hens I'll pick another recipe.

The Cornish Hens were $4 each here, so I substituted bone-in chicken breasts.  I sauteed the leeks as directed, then stuff them with lemon slices under the skin, dusted with poultry seasoning and salt, then baked.  It was very good although the chicken did not pick up much leek/lemon flavor; however, I mixed the cooked leeks in with my couscous and enjoyed.

Yummy and simple!!!  The flavors infuse the entire bird. I used several suggestions from other reviewers when making this dish.  For example, I mixed herbs in soft butter and rubbed the hens before roasting.  I also saved some of that herbed butter to add later--help with keeping the meat moist.

This recipe is perfect. I love that it has far less sodium because you arn't using any kind of chicken broth. And I love leeks ! I like to make an almond and wild rice stuffing to go in before baking, then serve it with cooked asparagus and lemon dill sauce.

A very good basic recipe and quite adaptable.  I didn't have leeks so I used  shallot and brushed olive oil over the top.  Made a simple gravy with the drippings and some chicken stock.

I made the recipe exactly as written, and found it very easy to do.  The flavor was very delicate - I love leeks!   Next time, I may add some more leeks, perhaps a little garlic and some more salt.
