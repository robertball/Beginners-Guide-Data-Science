With 1/2 cup of butter anything is good! This was a delicious recipe- for those of you not following the recipe ( skim milk, low fat sour cream etc) you should not be rating THIS recipe, you have changed it and it seems unfair to the person who posted. Just sayin....

I freaked out when I saw this recipe because I didn't know how much 2 lb of potatoes was. I used a kitchen scale, and 2 lb of potatoes is approximately 8 medium-sized potatoes. This recipe is very delicious and creamy. Definitely reccomended!

Update: I usually do not have garlic in the house so I often add garlic powder or garlic salt and taste test to see how much is necessary

This is a great recipe! The only thing I would change is the garlic... I found that adding the fresh chopped garlic was a bit strong and next time I think I'll saute it in olive oil for a minute or two just to take the edge off. Very good recipe though.

We really enjoyed these!  Creamy texture, rather than the fluffiness I usually associate with mashed potatoes.  I love potatoe skin, though, and it's so nutritious!  I have also tried baking the potatoes for an hour and then mashing them.  Also turns out well!  Thumbs up!

Used Yukon Gold potatoes, and put some peeled garlic (to taste) into the water the potatoes were boilng in...Mashed it all together and added the rest of the ingredients...Sprinkled a little parmesean cheese and paprika on top just before serving...Can also sprinkle on some finely chopped scallions for a little extra flavor and color

Maybe it's my fault for using skim milk, fat-free sour cream & low-fat butter substitute, but this tasted too "light" to me, like it had no substance or "oomph".

I loved these ptoatoes. Skins are great for you and I think red or yukon potatoes would be best. I boiled 4 whole garlic cloves with the potatoes. I used maine potatoes and they were good. I added more sour cream and omitted basil. I just felt like it had no place in the potatoes I served with Texas ranch chicken from this site. Yummy

I really liked these.  I'm not a huge fan of garlic, so instead of adding directly to the potatoes, i used 1 tsp crushed garlic right in the water when i boiled the potatoes.  Gives a little hint of garlic but not overpowering.

Before trying this recipe, I'd never made skin-on mashed potatoes, although I'd had them at restaurants. 

I'd use thinner-skinned potatoes next time, as there seemed to be a lot of skin in them. Also, my husband wasn't crazy about the flavor, although I liked it. 

They were really easy to make though - I loved not having to peel the potatoes!

Pretty basic mashed potatoes, but adding raw garlic was the new factor for me.  I used fresh rather than dried basil, and I did use the minced garlic (at least I'm *assuming* the submitted meant minced, not chopped).  While not totally unpleasant, I will not add raw garlic to mashed potatoes again.  I do like garlic in mashed potatoes - but roasted.

These mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. I'm not a very experienced cook and it was my first time making homemade mashed potatoes and it was an easy recipe to follow and they came out delicious. Regular garlic seasoning or salt works just fine too!

Even my Irish taste buds declare these so delicious!  I was dubious about both the skins and the sour cream, but these were creamy and hearty and just so good. I did skip the basil as I felt it would be in competition with the herbs in the shepherd's pie for which it was a topping, but didn't miss it at all.

These are great!  Mashed potatoes should always be made with the skin on.  I took out the milk and added 1/4 cup of cream cheese and they were wonderful!

I've made this recipe so many times that I know it by memory. So delicious! I don't change a thing, except that I substitute garlic powder for the chopped garlic to save some time. I also use fat-free sour cream, and nobody can tell.

Went to make this, started to add the sour cream, and realized I had none.  So, I used cream cheese instead.
Second time I made this recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Another great way to make a classic.  Thanks for the post.

These were great. I used 3/4 tsp garlic powder & 1/2 tsp italian seasoning. I also halved the recipe & used 2 tbsp light butter-which worked fine. Very, very creamy & delicious. So great to not have to peel those potatoes! Thanks!

These are delicious!  I used them in another recipe in place of instant potatoes and made my husband (the non-cook) make them while I was preparing the other part of the meal.  We cheated and used garlic powder.  They came out completely amazing.

Made these last night for dinner, and they were EXTREMELY good.  The rest of the family didn't realize the skin (which they normally whine about.)  I didn't even need to add pepper it was that good.

Followed the recipe, added a bit more sour cream because we like our potatoes on the creamy side. Nice not having to peel potatoes and much healthier. Thanks for the recipe.

I was never able to make "lump free" mashed potatoes.  Decided to stop trying & named my potatoes "country mashed potatoes."  This is pretty much it.  Everyone loves them--and I don't have to apologize for lumps!  ;-0!  And that's a GOOD THING!

Whatever you do, do NOT leave out the basil! I use fresh, and it's awesome. Leaving on the skin is SO much healthier for you. I used red rose and Yukon gold potatoes. Thank you for this recipe! I've made it several times now.

Very creamy and the skins add a nice texture.  Added a dash of paprika but other than that followed the recipe to a T.  Next time I will use a bit less salt.

Easy & really delicious! The potatoes took longer than 15 min to boil, but they were worth the wait :-) Also, I would recommend using an electric mixer on the potatoes to make the chunks of potato skins smaller. But they are easier than regular mashed and are really tasty!

Excellent recipe. I used redskin potatoes and the slightly sweet taste and smooth texture they have worked well in this recipe. I also added a few whole cloves of garlic to the potatoes when they were boiling and mashed them up with the potatoes. I did not add the butter since my family does that at the table. Very good, my kids loved it as well. I will never want to peel potatoes again and why should I? This is more nutritious, easier and tasty.

I used this recipe with extra garlic on top of a Shepherd's Pie. I recommend trying it on your Shepherd's Pie because it is really great and you will never go back to plain old mashed potatoes.

For mashed potatoes, not bad at all. I did leave out the sour cream as I'm not a big fan. I also used Idaho potatoes.

I goofed on this recipe, I didn't boil the potatoes long enough so they weren't completely done, (we were to anxious to eat!)  The taste was really good though, we put extra sour cream on top along with some cheddar cheese.  Will be making these again for sure, next time I'll practice a little more patience.  Thanks for the recipe.

So good!  I love the texture that the skin gives the mashed potatoes- it adds a little more substance and more nutrients as well.  Works great with gravy but the basil and garlic give it such a great flavor that it really doesn't need anything added!

Wow! such a simple and tasty recipe. I tried it last night and it was a winner! I didn't put in dried basil nor milk, but added extra sour cream and butter. It was really quite fattening, but such a treat!

Very good!  I added some asiago cheese in the last step for a little extra flavor.  My husband, who is not a big potato fan, helped himself to 2 huge servings.  We will make this one again.

I love this recipe.  I have used one similar to this but keeping the skins on makes it that much easier and enjoyable.

These mashed potatoes were marvelous! I wasn't sure how they'd be with the skin on, but they ended up being so tasty and my whole family loved them!

Simply excellent!  I've made these enough times that now I play with the sour cream, butter and garlic measurements and they're fantastic if you go by the recipe exactly or do change amounts of things on the list of ingredients!

This was a great recipe for a classic comfort food! My wife and I loved it. She and I are vegan, so I simply replaced the milk, sour cream, and butter ingredients with vegan equivalents. Worked perfectly.

These were really good! I did cut down on the butter and cut out the salt & pepper. I probably had more potatoes too but were still really good! Next time I will add more green onions and maybe a bit more milk.

15 minutes is not even close. We did a second boil to salvage the food, but definitely check em' with a fork to see if they are soft. Mine were raw at the core.

We loved these! I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream because we didn't have any and they turned out great.

May be able to leave out the basil; possibly replace with parsley.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was delicious! It was one of the easier mashed potato recipes I found, and I liked that it uses no heavy cream. I used 3/4 the basil called for because I thought kids would prefer it that way. I used Yukon Gold potatoes. If you have a few extra minutes, roast the garlic in the oven, in a bit of olive oil, for a few minutes before adding it to the potatoes, to mellow the garlic.

I've made this several times.  Always delicious but I like it best with thin skin potatoes like Yukon gold.  Still good with Russett though.
