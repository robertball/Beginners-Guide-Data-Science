A little Teddy Graham in place of the mini graham crackers made these just too cute to resist, and they are yummy too! This would be a cute project to do with little ones. My teenagers loved them!

Cute idea.  I needed to see the photo to clarify the instructions a bit.  Thanks.

Be careful not to cut too much off the bottoms of the berries - or there's nothing to hold the Nutella in ;) I shopped at Trader Joe's, so I used chocolate almond spread, instead of the Nutella. I loved the Teddy Graham's that Kim's Cooking Now! used - but TJs had kitties that I used instead. I filled the strawberries the night before, topping them in the morning, as a side for breakfast. Adults and kids alike loved these [some without the toppings.] These were fine for family, but for company, I would not do them ahead, at all...

These came out cute and tasty but I had trouble with the whipped cream melting very fast. Even after placing them in the refrigerator the cream melted. Any suggestions? I would definitely not make ahead of time.

I didnâ€™t put the mini graham crackers on, no room. Everyone loved them.  I also used cool whip instead of whipped cream.

Really good and very cute. I took this to a July 4th party (red, white, and blue), and it was a hit.
