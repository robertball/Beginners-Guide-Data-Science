For a basic beef stew recipe, this is very good.  I did have to change it though.  I tossed the beef in 3 Tbsp. regular flour with lemon pepper, chili powder, and garlic powder.  I browned it with a little olive oil.  I put it in the crock pot (because I needed my oven for other baking) and it turned out fine.  The other change I made was using 1/2 c. V-8 and 1/2 c. bloody mary mix.  I thought it would give it a little kick, and it did.  In the last about 20 minutes, I added a cup of frozen peas for some color.  Along with lots of salt and pepper, it turned out great.  This recipe is a great base to build off of and add whatever you like for flavors!

EXCELLENT Irish stew recipe. Very easy to make. The brown sugar it calls for in the recipe does make it a bit sweeter than I like it so I omit the sugar when I make it. Kids LOVE it!!! This will become a family tradition recipe for us! Thank you for sharing it!

Have made this for years. I always used a spicy tomato cocktail drink. Hoppin Tom or spicy V-8 and never used any sugar. Always raves and NEVER any left over. Hardy and delicious and extremely simple. Never had a need to brown meat before hand.Always tender and veggies perfect. NEVER open oven door and peek as heat goes down and takes a long time to raise back up.  Just throw in oven and forget it for 5 hours!!

I was skeptical. A stew made with only 1 cup of liquid? And that liquid is a can of V8? But this was GOOD. And SO easy! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing next time.  My husband is Irish and very picky about his stew. He loved it, and it will definitely go into regular cirulation at our house. (He would like me to specify that he's from Ireland, not a "Plastic Paddy" - a term used to describe an American who claims Irish heritage. No offense to those of Irish heritage!) You know what this seemed like? Each piece was coated with a delicious thick sauce the same way a Chinese dish like orange chicken is, but the dish is not overwhelmed with sauce. This was so appetizing that I couldn’t resist it, and I don’t eat beef!  Next time I'll take a picture.

Delicious!  A couple of suggestions...next time I will brown the meat to seal in the juices.  Even after cooking for 5 1/2 hours, the meat wasn't as soft as I would have liked.  Also, IMPORTANT, I will add a teaspoon of salt and a dash of pepper.  The veggies needed some seasoning and were a tad bland.  But overall, this is a WINNER RECIPE!  Incredible stew, and so easy.  Oh, and a question for the person whose veggies weren't soft after 5 hours of baking....was your oven on?  :)

This is a very easy and hearty beef stew and perfect for a warming winter meal.  I used regular flour and it came out great.  A great basic staple that everyone loves!

This was the most delicious stew I have ever eaten -- not to mention the easiest and healthiest.  I did add more potatoes and a few spears of broccoli.  Not as spicy as I thought it would be which was fine with me.  Thumbs up!

This turned out great considering I have never cooked before.  I made this for my dorm floor, and it was gone in five minutes.  Very hearty, add garlic and spices like cayenne pepper to add zest.

This is very tasty, and so low maintenance!  I did add extra liquid (a couple cups of beef broth, because we like some gravy) and some italian seasoning, as we like things highly seasoned and the recipe didn't call for any.  Thanks!

Very bland.  Ended up with meat and vegtables like a roast, no juice or sauce to really make it a stew.

Really good, came out tasty and meat very tender. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would leave the sugar out.  It made the dish just too sweet. It needs no sugar at all.  I had to add more salt that I would have liked to combat the sweetness.

I've made this stew many ways for years. I use a can of tomatoes instead of the juice cocktail. It's a stew that you can tweak to meet your taste buds but it turns out great each time.

As written I found this to be bland. The only thing different I did originally was that I used cornstarch instead of the flour to thicken. I ended up adding some leftover cooked cabbage, Worcestershire and various herbs to give it more flavor and it turned out okay. I think using the spicy vegetable juice cocktail would be a must if I make this again.

Great recipe, but I must not have been careful enough in my flour measurement; they didn't "flatten" and tended to crumble. I did add a pinch of salt and some vanilla as suggested in other comments, and they tasted great.

This technique earns 5 stars, but the flavor is lacking (despite using a mixture of Spicy Hot V-8 and bloody mary mix).  I also added salt, pepper, cayenne, rosemary, and roast beef seasoning.  I used cornstarch instead of flour, which worked fine. Next time I make this, I'll omit the sugar and tweak the spices more to ramp up the flavor.

This was wonderful. I couldn't believe how beautiful it looked when I removed the foil.  I did make a few small changes to the sauce - I added a few spashes of worcestershire sauce and a tablespoon of beef base, and I did salt and pepper the meat and veggies. Will definitely be making this one again.

This recipe is totally solid. It needs a little salt and pepper, some garlic powder, and perhaps a dash of Worcestershire sauce to really kick it into "awesome," but even without the extra ingredients, the meat comes out incredibly tender. I might suggest using waxy potatoes, which won't get as mealy as they cook.

Loved IT!!!!!Had it lastnite. We made a couple additions though.  We used pork, which was so tender.. also added beef broth, minced garlic, worchestershire sauce and salt and pepper and tossed the meat in flour and browned it first.  The meat was excellent...so tender.. can't til lunchtime to have it again....

Very easy and very good.  I love having dinner prepared by lunchtime so I can take the rest of the day off. We sometimes add a cup of frozen peas just before serving.

We used all-purpose flour and regular V8 juice.  Not spicy, but still full bodied - no need for additional spices unless you want to change it up with parsley or basil.  Definitely will be in our Favorites list!
