I really like this recipe. The second time I made it, I added a layer of tomato sauce and sauteed onions, and put sliced tomatoes on top before I baked it. The tomatoes give the dish an added kick that really worked. Thanks for the recipe!

I will confess I added to this recipe to help enhance the flavor.  I added the following: Garlic powder Thyme Parsley Parmesean cheese Tomato sauce (you can experiment with different flavors too)  The additional ingredients really added dimension to this dish.

I knew from the start that this recipe would need some doctoring up, based on other reviews and the list of ingredients. But I don't like to review a recipe and say, "Okay, this recipe is great, but first you have to do this, this and this" and by the end you're nowhere near the original recipe. I also like to make a recipe from start to finish by the letter the first time I try it. Having said that, even with a few changes/additions of spices, this recipe is on the bland side. But that's what I was looking for!! I wanted something I could eat for breakfast that was on the savory side, not spicy, not offensive smelling when it was re-heated. This recipe was great for that. If you're looking for an impressive wowza side-dish, look elsewhere, but for what this is and for a change of routine for breakfast, this was good.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I normally like the combination of spinach and cottage cheese, but in this dish they didn't blend very well, which gave the spinach a bland flavor.  I'd give it another shot, but would add seasoning to the mixture (garlic powder, maybe garlic salt) and double the crumb topping to enhance what's beneath.

This recipe was very nice made with fresh spinach. I think I will add a quarter cup of fresh parmesan next time though - it needed a little more zip!

I agree with other reviewers that this is a great base to add a little to.  I added onions, garlic, basil and chicken breast (already cooked) this time, leaving it pretty bland for the little ones and we added more spices at the table.

This is a base that has potential. I used fresh spinach,then added mushrooms, black olives and diced salami. For spices, I added a tsp. of Italian seasoning, a dash of red pepper flakes, and served with shredded Parmesan on top.

Pretty tasty. I sauteed the spinach in a little olive oil with minced onion, plus I added a can of tomato sauce at the end. Pretty tasty, I thought. But the kids weren't crazy about it. They ate it b/c they were hungry enough!

I love the cottage cheese in this recipe, BUT, way too many ingredients need to be added to give the dish enough flavor to be a favorite.  i.e.  Fresh grated parm cheese.  You might as well just add cottage cheese to any of the other really good alfredo recipes.

This recipe was quick and easy, but was not satisfying. The cottage cheese did not mix well with the spinach at all. very disappointing.

I thought the concept was great - love all the ingredients - but I couldn't get through the leftovers. The flavors just didn't go together quite right and it was extremely bland.

This casserole, while super easy to make, ended up being rather bland and the bread crumbs didn't "crunch" as they were supposed to.  Definitely needs a little spice - I ended up adding some Frank's Red Hot, some salt and a lot of pepper to make this a bit tastier.  Not sure I'll make it again.

Great recipe. My family enjoyed the casserole. It was easy to prepare. I added the layer of tomato sauce, sauteed onions and slice tomatoes on top before baking as suggested in an earlier review.

I did not care for this recipe. I didn't have much faith since there are no spices or seasonings, and even though I added a few extra spices myself, it still doesn't taste good.  I am usually a fan of spinach pasta dishes, but this one takes the cake on not so good.

My husband and I loved this! I got the impression it was going to be bland so I started adding ingredients from the get go. I added sliced olives and mushrooms. Instead of the old bread, I used some pre-seasoned bread crumbs that I had. I also added some tomato sauce across the top and sprinkled it with some grated cheese. This was a great starter recipe and I will definitely be making it again!

B-O-R-I-N-G. I added a sauteed onion, parmesan cheese and nearly a cup of tomato sauce, and still I can't give this more than a 3. It's boring! It's easy, but not fabulous, not memorable, not interesting. I won't make again unless I do a lot to it, in which case, we're talking a whole new recipe.

I made this recipe for lunch for my 3 year old and myself, satisfied with the result, this is the kind of recipes i like, simple, not complicated ingredients, easy to cook and good flavor, the only "variation" that i made was the seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder and italian seasoning. Best of all almost half percent of protein intake, i will definitely do it again!

Needed Parmesan cheese on top. I also doubled the spinach.  For the reviewer who said the cottage cheese didn't mix in, fat free cottage cheese won't mix in well.  If you add a higher fat cottage cheese to the hot pasta and cook the spinach first, it should be fine.

I loved this casserole.  I did add a handful of grated parmesan just because I had it, but think it would have been good without.  Am planning to make it again for company.
