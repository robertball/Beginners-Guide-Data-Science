It has great flavor but even though I only added 3/4 of the noodles, it was too dry. Next time I'll add 1/2 of the noodles and see if that works.

I would agree that it's very thick. I added about 3 tablespoons of sesame oil. Has a nice little kick to it, but I feel like it was still missing something. Hence the 3 stars.

This was good! It is very thick when you try to mix the sauce with the pasta, so I'm glad that I reserved some pasta water to thin it out a bit. I think this would be best served right away, b/c as it cooled it became very thick again. The flavor was good...the family didn't care for this, so I probably wont be making it again, but I loved trying it...Thanks for sharing. :)
