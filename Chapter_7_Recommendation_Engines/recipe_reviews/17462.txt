My husband and 15 yr. old son thought this cake was "the greatest"! It is very simple and the topping makes the cake.  I used pecans and also added 1/2 of the mandarin orange juice to the cake mix,making it delicious and very moist. A wonderful, easy, supper dessert!

This is a nice easy and quick recipe.  At first I couldn't believe there was no butter in the batter.  But then I realized the more I mix it, the more liquid it becomes because the mandarin oranges becomes flakes.

You don't taste the orange, but it is a light and refreshing cake.  If you are looing for something not overly sweet and can stand alone without a glob of icing on top, this is a good recipe

I followed the directions perfectly, and then when it was finished baking, I put a cake tester in it and it cake out with all this stuff on it... so, I put the cake back in the oven and it wound up baking for another half hour.  But when I toook it out and tried to flip it, it wouldn't flip, so I then decided to loosen the sides  and it finally did flip, but when it finally flipped, I found out that the bottom was a sticky substance and stuck to the bottom, not allowing the cake to filp.  So, I then cleaned out my pan, and re-greased it.  I put the mixture back in and tried to let it re-bake.  It turned out weird again and I finally decided to give up.

I made this yesterday and it's almost gone!  My husband said, "I can't stay away from this cake!" ...and this from a man who doesn't like desserts without chocolate.

I didn't have coconut and didn't feel like using nuts so I made it without. The frosting really makes this cake!

I made this healthier by using white whole wheat flour and cutting the sugar a little.  I used pineapple instead of oranges.  It's what I had on hand.  I put the icing on as soon as the cake came out.  Then, put it under the broiler 6 in. from heat for 3-4 min. until toasty brown.   Very, very good!

Pretty good; I didn't have the nuts the recipe called for or the amount so I used about 3 oz. of pecans and they tasted great together. I also cut up a peach and put it on top and that was good too. The only thing I don't really like about the cake is how moist/soggy it is.

I liked making this cake because it was very easy and quick.  I agree with everyone else that it doesn't taste much like oranges, but my friends and I enjoyed the sugary topping and overall it was a big hit.

Went by the recipe. This cake  is excellent but it doesn't taste much like orange. My granddaughter pointed out that canned mandarins taste pleasant but not really orange. She suggested using cuties for flavor. Lol.  Faster, easier  and less messy than a box cake, yet tastes 10 times better.  This  recipe is a keeper.

This is a nice moist coffee cake.  I added some blueberries 1/2 cup to it and it turned out really great!

Oranges are my passion and I'm always looking for a recipe that is made from scratch and not from a box (though boxing it does come in handy sometimes!) I agree with one reviewer that the orange flavor doesnt come through strongly when I made it the first time.  Being in the orange cake business at Orange Clementine, I was exploring the combination of flavors of coconut with the mandarines.  Here's what I did the second time to put some amazing flavor into the cake... I put the zest of one orange and beat it with a fork into the 3 tablespoons of butter and I did half vanilla, half natural orange oil for the flavoring.  The cake was lovely but I am going to explore omitting the leaveners because my palate can detect that flavor.... happy zesting everyone!  Clem
