My new favorite! I have made it twice. The first time the crust almost burned before inside done- so the second time I microwaved the inside in a glass bowl for 2minutes to speed up the cooking time inside. I also cooked the pie crust in the oven- I love my crust flakey on the bottom- After the pie crust was lightly cooked I poured the microwaved pie mixture in the pie and cooked till the crust was a nice brown and the inside was done.  Awesome!  I speed up many recipes using the microwave to precook the insides alittle faster. Pies or casseroles or baked potatoes!

I think, people should give  review off of the recipe that is posted, not a recipe that they have created by changing what has been kindly given to us. Post your own, if you are just going to change everything, and then say I tweaked this, added that, and omitted this, other than that, was a great recipe. It frustrates me. This is a great pie, just the way it is, thank you for sharing.

My family loved this recipe. I made two pies and one I used nutmeg and the other ground cinnamon. I have to say the one with cinnamon came out better. A word of advice, use deep dish pie crust.Thanks For Such A Wonderful Recipe.

This recipe will do but I have one that's been used in my family for generations that notes some differences:  3 eggs (beaten), 1 1/2 C. sugar, 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter (melted, cooled to lukewarm), 1/2 C. Buttermilk (make your own by adding a tabls. of vinegar to milk and let sit 1/2 hour - same chemical reaction), 2 Tabls. flour,rounded - not heaping, 1 teas. pure vanilla.  Mix/sift together (sifting originated decades ago when flour almost always had mealy bugs in it!!) sugar and flour, add buttermilk, butter, eggs and vanilla. Mix well. Pour into pie shell (hard for the best cook to beat Pillsbury's frig crust - but use a Deep Dish if using frozen). Bake at 400 for 15 minutes. Reduce to 325 for apx. 30-40 minutes. Note: Pie should rise up in the middle - it will fall to level upon cooking. Additional test; shake - should not wiggle in the middle. This pie melts in your mouth and couldn't be easier. Variations: Add some fresh sliced peaches in a round across the top when in season. Or - Toss over some mini chocolate chips after that first 15 minutes. Enjoy whatever version!!

I made this pie today and it really turned out great.  I did a little bit of substitution--instead of eggs I used egg beaters, Splenda instead of sugar and Reduced Fat Buttermilk.  Not sure how many calories I saved but it was still great and it was also more diabetic friendly.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!  We generally purchase a buttermilk pie each week from an amazing restaurant ($28 per pie) that we truly love...until we decided to try THIS recipe :o)  I have already made two pies and they literally disappeared.  The flavor and texture are right on.  I do not add the entire tbs of lemon juice (but almost)...and I increase the vanilla by just a smidge...besides that - NO changes and you end up with total perfection!  THANKS SO MUCH for the recipe :o)

I made this for the first time (yesterday) for an office party, which everyone raved over. Very simple and easy. One suggestion: for a more intense lemon flavor; I used fresh lemon juice from a whole lemon (a smidge over 2 Tbsp) and zested some of the rind into the batter. Also, bake on the lowest rack in the oven. I did this, which allowed it to baked completely through the center, yet to a golden brown perfection. - Then, dust it lightly with powdered sugar.

This pie is delish!!  I am not a lemon lover, so left that out and used approx. 2 t. vanilla instead.  Also, left out the nutmeg.  My husband wants me to add coconut to it the next time. This is definately a keeper.

I lost my own buttermilk pie recipe and thought this was the closest to the one I made for years.  The pie was tasty and I got lots of compliments.  Like every other buttermilk pie recipe there is always a little of the custard that will not fit into the pie shell.  I made three pies and had enough left over from each to make a small pie to leave at home.  I followed  someone's previous suggestion and tried two with cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  I liked both versions.  I think it just depends whether you like the flavor of nutmeg or cinnamon better.  Great recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I read some of the reviews and did these changes. Microwaved the filling for 4 min to get it going, also baked the crust for about 4 min as well, to avoid pie being runny. Also instead of 3 Tbsp of flour I used 2 and added 1 Tbsp of corn starch, thinking it will help the pie set and it did! Took 50 min in the owen and top didn't burn and yet, pie was nice and firm, it settled even more after it cooled off. However I found it bit too sweet, so next time I will cut down the sugar just a tad. Overall will make it again with these changes, otherwise it would have bee all 5 stars!

I have been trying for four years to get my Grandmother-In-Law's custard pie just right and haven't done it yet. (I think it's more a matter of my Husband's nostalgia than any actual pie). But I made this recipe tonight and it was declared the new favorite, don't tell Grandma =)

I made this oh-so-remarkable pie today using the adjustments recommended by others (sugar reduced from 1.5 cups to 1 cup and butter reduced from 8 tablespoons to 5) and it was utter perfection. I chose this recipe WITH the above amendments after researching new and old family recipes around the internet. I wanted to get this Buttermilk Pie right the very first time, because I was making it for someone special. So glad to have found this recipe!

This is a great recipe! I left out the lemon juice and used cinamon instead of nutmeg. Also, I used 2 tablespoons of vanilla and 1 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Came out perfectly!!

I was going to rate this with 4 stars because I thought it was just a tad too sweet but my husband said it was the best buttermilk pie he's had so I gave it 5 stars.  I also used a homemade pie crust from allrecipes.com Basic Flaky Pie Crust.  What is nice about this crust is that I have not made one bad crust and when I make extra I can freeze it and it still comes out nice and flaky!  I took a bit of advise from another reviewer and used cinnamon as well as the nutmeg.  This really is an easy pie recipe and I wil probably make another one tomorrow for a gathering of our friends.  I am really pleased with this pie and cannot believe that I've been buying slices for the price it takes to make one!  This is about the most fool-proof recipe one can ask for!

A good old-fashioned pie.  It took 70 minutes to bake, and I covered the crust partway through cookiing so it wouldn't get burnt.  I liked the browning on top and felt that it added to the flavor.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is reduce the sugar.  Both my RM and I felt that the pie is too sweet as-is.  And the key to this pie's success is a nice balance between sweet and tart.

Awesome creamy custard like pie base for many flavors. I added extra lime juice instead of lemon and coconut shavings/flakes. It was so good! I didn't even use a crust. I just dusted the buttered pan with flour  and poured it in.

Fabulous!  The best chess pie I've ever had.  After baking for 30 minutes I reduced the oven temperature by 25 degrees and laid a piece of foil over the pie to prevent the top from over browning.  This increased the baking time to about seventy minutes, but the extra time was worth it. A beautiful pie worthy of a state fair ribbon.

First attempt at this and it was good but a little too sweet for my tastes. Being diabetic I used splenda instead of sugar, possibly that was it.

Slight changes to the recipe (all suggested by other reviewers). I cooked my pie shell for 4 minutes, I subbed one tbsp of flour for cornstarch and used slightly less sugar than called for. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. The batter CURDLED. I freaked out and thought it was ruined, but cooked it anyway with small hope. Then I read online somewhere else that this might happen and not to panic. I still had my doubts, especially when the top looked very brown. BUT!!!! It tastes great! The top is brown, but not burnt and as another reviewer stated, it gives it a good flavor. It's very lemony with just 1 tbsp of lemon, but I might consider adding the zest next time. I have no idea why it curdled though....

Very good pie.  The only change I made was I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg, as other reviewers suggested.  Next time I might cut the sugar back to 1 cup, as it is kind of sweet.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is pretty good. My grandmother used to make these and they were wonderful so I thought I would give it a try. I followed the recipe exactly without making any changes. The only thing that I will change in the future is either eliminating the lemon juice or reducing it. I find the lemon taste very prominent in this pie which I wasn't expecting but it still tasted good. Also this pie is best eaten when it's completely cooled or the next day after baking.

It was really good! I took advice of others and: Started pie off at 400 degrees for 15 minutes then lowered to 325 for an additional 40 minutes. 55 mn total cooking time. Very easy to make and it really hit the sweet spot ;-) Definitely use a DEEP DISH pie crust and pan.

So very rich and delicious.  The only thing I'd change is the amount of sugar.  (Since I've reduced my sugar intake, I can't take things that are too sweet.)

Very, very good buttermilk pie.  Next time I will reduce sugar by 1/2-2/3 cup.

This was really good! The second pie I have ever made in my life and it turned out great! I did put my eggs out so they would be at room temp when I mixed everything.

This was really easy to make. I only use a 1c. of sugar and it was just right. This was my first time making a buttermilk pie and tasting a buttermilk pie. I give it a 5 stars!! Very yummy!!

My great grandmother used to make these pies. My mom had the recipe and somehow I never got a copy. This pie is exactly like hers. It was delicious. It is sweet and rich so go easy on the size of the slices. I left out the nutmeg just because I don't like it but other than that I cooked it about 10 minutes longer. Thank you for sharing.

I recommend: If you get frozen 9-inch pie crusts you MUST pre-cook it. Marie Callendar's pie crusts instruct people to pre-cook it about 10 mins at 400 degrees after pricking the sides and bottom thoroughly. First thaw them at room temp for 15 mins. This is very important. I think if people skip this step then any pies, specifically custard or pudding type pies will not set in the center.  Secondly, I would use a Meyer lemon, these lemons are not so "sour" and they are great for cooking with a nice lemon but not sour flavor. A bit of lemon zest, as someone recommended, sure, why not?  I cut the sugar down to only 1 C.  Some people love super sweet pies and others do not. So it's personal taste. Just recall that true Southern pies tend to be very very sugary, so keep this in mind. Bon Appetit!

I used refrigerated, pre-rolled pie crusts, and made 2 pies (out of one recipe... it would be great for a single deep-dish pie, but there's too much for a regular pie plate).  Because one of the reviewers mentioned that she almost burned the crust the first time she made it, I covered the edges of my crust with aluminum foil, which kept them from scorching.  When I tested the pies for doneness at 40 minutes, they still needed a few minutes, so I took off the aluminum foil and when the pies were done the crusts were a lovely golden brown.  Apart from splitting the filling between two shells, I made no other substitutions, and believe me, this recipe doesn't need any!  Wonderful pie... a new favorite.  I'm glad I made 2, so I can freeze one for later.

This is the best buttermilk pie in the world. I did make one substitution, I used 1% buttermilk & it didn't changed the flavor or consistancy of the pie. This is by far the best, thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

I love this pie, it always comes out so perfectly!  The only thing I do differently is add Splenda instead of sugar, since there are two diabetics in the family.  It's a delicious, sugar-free pie we all love.

It really is a delicious pie, I made it exactly - lemon, vanilla & sprinkled with nutmeg before baking, the three flavorings together just make it so yum.  I made homemade lard pie crust which puts it over the top decadent.

What an EASY pie!  And talk about delicious!  I made one out of curiosity ... next thing I knew, I had requests to make three more.  This NEVER survives in my kitchen for more than 2 days.  Used Marie Callendar's deep dish frozen crust.  Didn't use cinnamon or nutmeg but it was WONDERFUL anyway!  This is a KEEPER!  Thank you!

One thing not included in the directions which would have helped me was that you need to cool, then refrigerate this pie once it cooks. I cut into it when it was still a bit warm and it was more like pudding/custard with the sugary bits separated towards the top. Mine did not look like the picture. Also, it calls for 1/8 of a TABLESPOON (not teaspoon); crazy measurement. I had to google what the equivalent was but ended up using 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. My only future change to this is I will use less sugar.

This pie is delicious made following the recipe exactly. It is similar to a custard pie, but creamier and less eggy. Cook it until the middle no longer jiggles.

This recipe is the hands down fav. At our house now that summer is over and blackberries aren't in season for BlackBerry cobbler. This was SO GOOD! I only put half the amount of butter when I make a double recipe, since I did this once when I didn't have enough. So delicious and still AWESOME. We also use our homemade buttermilk from our raw cows milk....mmm. I'm only 15, but hey...it's still easy to make for non cookers as well. I do suggest putting less sugar...and more lemon.

This is the best & easiest pie recipe ever! I am not a hardcore baker but you would never know it because this recipe made my buttermilk pies a hit over the holidays! Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe. The first 3 pies I made using this recipe, I substitued with Crisco butter flavored sticks. The last pie I made, I used regular butter. The only difference is that with regular butter the pie will bubble more and release a lot of air but it makes for a prettier pie.Thanks again!

The flavor of this pie is exceptional, but I couldn't get it to firm up for the life of me! I don't know if the temperature gauge is off in my oven or what, but I left this in waaaaay longer than it needed to be. Maybe if I make it again I'll use some cornmeal to help it thicken as someone else suggested.

I wish that I knew what buttermilk pie should taste like or what the texture was supposed to be like. Not sure mine cooked the whole way through. I think I should have left in a little longer. (left in 50 min.) The top set but the filling closer to the bottom is a little more custardy (I know that's not a word) than I think it is supposed to be. Used a regular sized 9 inch pie crust and the filling spilled over. (glad I put foil on bottom rack to catch the spillage!) If I tried this pie again I would make in a deep dish  and cook longer and on the bottom rack as someone suggested. Also would cover the crust with foil 1/2 way through to prevent burning.

Filling made 2 small pies.  For one of the pies, I added pumpkin pie spice as suggested;  the other I did not. The pie with the spice was the better of the two.

This is fantastic. Follow the recipe exactly - baking time of 50 minutes. I did rub a little cinnamon into the edge of my pie crust before baking and served with a little squeeze of fresh lemon and a dusting of powdered sugar. Keep it chilled and serve COLD!

This was a really great recipe.  It was kind of like custard pie meets a cheesecake.  I had no trouble with burning before it was set.  Perhaps try letting your eggs come to room temp before baking, that's what I always do when baking.

SO, SO delicious!!  My changes/thoughts.....not the biggest nutmeg fan BUT love cinnamon, so as you can guess, I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  No more changes just a suggestion that you use a deep dish pie plate.  This makes too little for 2 pies and too much for 1 pie!!   Having said all of that....great, easy pie!  Very classic taste!

Made this for the first time last night, with alterations based on reviews from others on here and in other buttermilk pie recipes.  Unfortunately I shouldn't have added extra flour, and because my eggs were so small, I used 4.  Bad call since it's much thicker, not the custard I was expecting.  But the flavor is nice, and it all fit in one 9" pie crust  (organic wheat crust, which goes well with this).  Next time I'll follow directions more closely.  But I did reduce the sugar down to 1.25 cups and would probably go down to 1 cup next time.  Very sweet.

Trying this recipe again today to use up the last of the buttermilk.  Added a few chocolate chips and reduced the sugar to one cup. Was better.

I have been thinking about buttermilk pie for years and before I had a computer, I didn't have the recipe.  My aunt, who has since passed away, used to make this pie every year at Christmas and it was so special.  She was from Alabama and the lady could cook!  Some people would never even taste the pie if you told them it had buttermilk in it.  I followed the recipe almost to the "T", but I omitted the lemon juice and added an extra little bit more of vanilla.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon salt and about a teaspoon of nutmeg. Before I poured the mixture into my store bought deep dish pie crust I dusted the crust with a tablespoon of flour and sprinkled the top with a tablespoon, also mixed with about 1/4 teasspoon nutmeg.  I read that somewhere and don't ask me what it does.:-)  Now when my niece and nephews eat it Christmas I want to see their faces when I tell them they just had buttermilk.  Delicious pie, girl.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy to follow directions (even my hubby made one for his squadron Thanksgiving dinner).  So far, I've made a total of 6 pies...you can say I have this recipe almost implanted in my memory =-)

During my 4th pie I ran out of vanilla, and it did taste like it was missing something, though it was still very good.  Try not to omit the vanilla...it makes a difference!

This pie was very easy to make and was very tasty. Just follow the recipe.

Prep time was about 5 minutes. Tips: eggs should be room temp. The recipe made too much filling for a standard pie shell, next time I'll try a deep pie pan.

The only change I made was to reduce the amount of sugar from 1 & 1/2 cups to 1 cup. Next time I make it, I will only put 3/4 cup sugar. Though my husband said to leave the full cup.

I never had buttermilk pie before.  I made this just to use up leftover buttermilk.  It was yummy!  Will make again! So easy too.   I did cut down sugar to only 1 cup.  I didn't add nutmeg, but instead added a little lemon zest. (I love lemon). 
Next time I will make sure to use a deep dish crust.  Since there was too much filling, I poured some into a ramekin.  (That was fine, but resulted in the actual pie with crust to have less custard and it certainly could have used it)

I added a tablespoon of grated lemon rind. Nice mild lemon flavor with creamy texture. Microwave filling for 2 minutes for faster cooking (40min) and less burning of crust.

This recipe was really simple.  I used a Pillsbury 9" deep frozen pie shell, which was perfect for the amount of batter.  The only modification made to the recipe is that I omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have any and I added cinnamon and nutmeg for flavor.  I really liked it, but the next time, I would decrease the sugar cause it was too sweet for me. I will definitely use this recipe again, and experiment by adding coconut, nuts, or chocolate.

Loved this pie! A little sweet for me, but that's just my personal preference. I'm making it again with a little less sugar. I know this will become a family favorite. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this without the crust, so I guess it wasn't really pie - but very different! And delicious!(That left out a lot of calories, too.) As long as I was juicing a lemon, I grated in about a tsp. or so of zest, which really "brightened" up the flavor. I loved it.
Update - 1/11/2018. This is just totally outstanding! I've been making it with the crust  lately. So simple! As long as you have a bit of buttermilk, you can make it at 3PM & have a wonderful company-worthy dessert for dinner! I've been using Fiori di Sicilia extract from King Arthur Flour instead of the vanilla extract. (It's a combination of citrus oil and vanilla)The kitchen smells yummy for hours! And maybe closer to 2 teaspoons of finely chopped lemon zest. Or, maybe use lemon extract with the vanilla. Also, I've used a deep-dish clay pie baker. I can trim the raw crust to filling level, and place tin foil over the top, because my crust always over browns. The foil won't touch the custard, and mar the top when you take it off. Oh, you can cut the sugar back to about a cup.

Very good pie, I did not change one thing about the recipe.  The next time I will leave out the lemon juice as we like our pies on the sweet side.  I am going to add this to my holiday menu.  Baked for 50 min and it was cooked perfectly.  Put rack on lowest position.

Loved this.  I had buttermilk that was given to me so I decided to search or something to use it with. I decided upon this pie. It was VERY good.  I have never even had Buttermilk pie previously but loved it.  I took the pie into work and everyone liked it!  It was gone in a flash.  I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon and cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cup, it was perfect.  The only issue I had was the crust getting dark too fast.  I will make this again

Made this the first time with a bit too much lemon juice (my mistake) and it turned out great. Made it a second time correctly per recipe and loved it more. Baked the pie crust for 10 minutes before adding pie mixture and it turned out so flaky. Just a very good dessert. Directions and time to make were right on. I think this might be a great base for coconut, lemon or lime pies and I plan to try them all. Thank you Tracy.

OK, well this was interesting. I read a LOT of the reviews and although I did add less sugar, I pre-baked the crust for a few minutes and baked the pie at 400F for 15 min. and then 350F for about 40 minutes. The texture was not as creamy as I would have thought. I had never made a pie like this before or tasted one. I think the family was being kind but didn't really like it. It took a long time to finish eating it!

I would make this again but I would cut back a bit on the sugar...maybe use only 1 cup or 1 1/4 cups.  I backed it 
in small custard cups and put whipped cream on top!  Everyone

This is a delicious recipe! I always make a caramel sauce with brown sugar, butter, salt, and cream and pour it over the top before serving. It brings it to another level! Yum!

My family loved it!  My local grocery did not have fresh nutmeg, therefore had to use my dried spices.  Turned out perfect substitutions are not necessary for this one!!!

This was my first try making a buttermilk pie and I have not heard of one before either but since I had a whole lot of buttermilk left in the fridge, which I didn't want to throw out, I thought I give it a try! My husband loved it, for me it was too sweet. So between okay for me and "love it" from my husband it deserves 4 stars. As somebody else suggested, I precooked it in the microwave for a couple minutes and baked it for 60 minutes, yet it was not fully done. Thanks for the recipe, the lemon flavor came out nice and the nutmeg blended in well also.

I loved it! I hadn't heard of buttermilk pie before but needed to use up some buttermilk so I gave it a go. I messed up horribly as I didnt thoroughly read the directions. I threw all ingredients together and just beat until smooth. I used the nutmeg and a bit of cinnamon. I will definitely make again, maybe even the right way.

Nobody in my family (including me) had ever tasted a buttermilk pie before, so we didn't have anything to compare it to, but this pie was very good! I would definitely make it again!

Turned out beautifully! I've made this one before (very similar to my grandmother's recipe), and loved it - only modifications: add both cinnamon and nutmeg, plus a little extra lemon juice and less sugar.

Too much sugar in this recipe. It is not balanced. I have a sweet tooth, but this buttermilk pie taste like a sugar pie. Although, I am a lemon lover the lemon juice also makes this pie super lemony and that doesn't balance well with the nutmeg. I say go with lemon and add zest and leave out the nutmeg all together, or cut down the lemon juice to 1 tsp. in this recipe. Still too much sugar tho. The cooking time is not great either for the unbaked pie shell called for in this recipe. I had a soggy shell on this pie that would have easily been rectified by either half blind baking the shell or cooking at a higher temperature at the beginning of the cooking and then turning it down after 10-15 min. Still on the hunt for that perfect buttermilk pie I grew up eating here in S. Texas. This ain't it.

Variation: 
I added about 2-3 tablespoons of rum and and substituted 1/4 of the sugar with shredded coconut. This works really well with the lemon.


The original recipe is great too. Overall this recipe is super easy and really delicious.

This pie had an excellent texture and taste. I think the secret is the lemon juice. I surprised  my husband by making this in November and he was in heaven. It was my first attempt at making Buttermilk Pie and it turned out fantastic!

Use FULL fat ingredients (otherwise, why bother). I used a frozen pie crust which turned out great in this pie.

We are always searching for recipes sweetened with honey, and I modified this one to use honey. I replaced sugar with 1 cup honey and reduced buttermilk to 3/4 cup. I baked at 325 degrees for about 50 - 55 min. It was wonderful!

AMAZING!! I had a lot of extra buttermilk from previously making a white chocolate cake. I had never even heard of buttermilk pie, but it sounded interesting. I tried it out one day, making one 9 inch deep dish pie and it was metrically the perfect amount of filling. My family loved it as did my coworkers. Still had buttermilk and decided to make two nine inch smaller pies, worked perfectly with the filling once more. I gave one Pie away and they loved it, kept the other one for a bbq and everyone who tried it loved it. Both times i used nutmeg and cinnamon in them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because i feel it can still be a bit better, something is missing and I plan on finding out what it is :)

This was hard to rate because in some ways I liked it and in some ways I didn't.  I think it's a good start but next time I would use much less sugar.  Too sweet for my taste.  I also think I am going to leave out the lemon and use cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  Just my personal taste.  Although I like lemon I think it made it too tart but maybe that was the buttermilk.  I've never had buttermilk Pie before so that might be how it's supposed to taste.

Loved this pie. Followed the recipe as it is with exception of adding chopped walnuts to the top prior to baking.  It turned out great and is now my favorite Buttermilk Pie recipe.

I made this after a last minute menu change for Thanksgiving since I had an extra pie crust and everything on hand. I would have given it all 5 stars except that I did make some very slight changes:  I followed the recommendation to start the filling in the microwave as I was worried about getting the crust/top too dark (photo honestly didn't build confidence either).  I basically warmed the filling with one minute increments, whisking before adding time since I didn't want to scramble the eggs.  Once is was fairly hot I poured it into the shell and followed the baking instructions.  I also switched out the nutmeg for cinnamon for personal preference and after tasting it we all agreed that that was the right choice...very little was and my left and my mother-in-law enjoyed having a pie her mom use to make. :)

I think less buttermilk and no nutmeg would be better. Following another suggestion, I microwaved the filling for several minutes before putting in the crust and baking. Had I not done so, it definitely would have burned the crust in the oven to get it to set. However, the texture was lumpy and not smooth as a result. Not a do-over.

I decided to make this last night around 10pm because I had the munchies and felt like something sweet. I found this, searching for recipes with buttermilk, and MAN was I happy with the outcome! I only had 2 eggs, so I reduced the other ingredients a bit. This pie was sweet, tangy, and ended up with a delicious sugary "crust" on the top...I will most definitely make this again! I used the "easy to remember pie crust" from this site, which was also ridiculously easy and delicious...

Light and gentle in flavor.  I never had buttermilk pie before and was quite impressed with the taste.  Definitely a good dessert for someone who doesn't like a rich dessert.   The only thing I'd change is cooking it in a pie tin...next time I'll use a tart pan.

Easy & delicious!   I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg- it really turned out great!  My father-in-law loved it! My new favorite dessert!

Very surprizing!  Nice texture, I might try slightly less sugar next time, was very sweet.  I did substitue cinnamon for the nutmeg.

Formed a nice chewy top layer, creamy inside.  Very mild flavor.  Remotely reminded me a bit of a lemon square- with not enough of the lemon in it.

I used four eggs because they were a little small.  I up the sugar to two cups because we like things sweet.  It was soooo good.  Mom's 92 she said it was the best she has ever ate.

Good recipe, thanks for sharing it with us.  I needed to use up some buttermilk (why don't they sell it in pints?) and this did the trick.  Even if the recipe was bad (which is wasn't) I would love it...who doesn't like Buttermilk Pie?

I made this recipe for my husband and he LOVED it.  He does not normally like buttermilk, but he loved this pie.  He wanted me to make one for the guys that he works with and now they keep requesting that I make another one.  This recipe is a keeper!!!!

This is like the recipe in Marcia Adams' Cooking from Quilt Country.  I tried it last night using a Pillsbury roll-out pie crust (easy!) and it was absolutely fabulous!  My husband had two pieces while it was still warm and I think it's even better today after sitting in the fridge all night.  There is an almost crunchy crust that forms on the top, which really distinguishes this pie from other pies, IMO.  I will most definitely make this again.

Made the recipe as is except swapped nutmeg for cinnamon, incredible flavor for such a simple recipe and might even be a new favorite, very light and creamy similar to a creme brulee may try additions another time like bourbon.

I've made probably 10 different recipes for a buttermilk pie in the last month. This one is by far the best. I even added an ounce of bourbon to a couple of them. This one is just easier and better. Just follow the actual instructions and you won't have any issues.

My family asked me to make this pie. I said sure, although Ive never made one; lemon chess is my specialty so how hard can it be. It proved to be pretty easy. My family loved it and wanted more (I make one pie). I followed the recipe as written with a slight modification. I added double the lemon juice, vanilla. Perfection!  Highly recommend.

I changed the nutmeg to cinnamon since I dont like nutmeg or allspice. It will be my recipe to use. It's very good and it made 2 pies instead of just 1.

Loved this pie. Easy to make with great results! My family loved it. Like a gun old-fashioned and unique taste of the past. I was worried it’d be a little sour—given that it’s buttermilk—but it was fantastic!

first time making a buttermilk pie ....twas HEAVENLY....only deviation: used ground nutmeg from my spice rack rather than freshly ground....and it was a good thing i did or i probably would have passed out it would have been so good....no fine restaurant could have served a better buttermilk pie...thank you so much for sharing....think i'll make it again this Sunday....( i cooked it slightly less than the 40 minutes i think my oven runs hot)

This was easy and good. I think I may have put to much lemon juice in it. But it was still really good. Thank you for sharing.

I took the advice of some other reviewers and used 1 cup sugar and 5 tablespoons butter but it still came out  a little too sweet. I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg which was a great sub and did not add lemon juice. This pie was sweet and filling. It had to cook for a full 60 minutes and was still a tad underdone on the very bottom but we didn't mind. It had a great texture and flavor.

I followed what a few others suggested - I used 1 cup of sugar and added 1 cup of coconut flakes. First time I used a regular ready made pie crust, it could not hold everything so the second time I used a deep dish crust and it was great!! Also, did not pre bake the crust so the crust didn't burn. Awesome awesome pie, especially when eaten cold. My husband couldn't stop himself!

I used a crust from Trader Joe's...Hands down the best frozen pie crust EVER! Just like Grandma used to make. I'd rather line the pie with cardboard rather than use Pillsbury...yuck. The pie turned out great. I made it according to directions...baked a few minutes longer.

Easy to make.  Buttertmilk pie is my husband’s favorite.  He thought it was great!   I think that when I make it again I will par bake the crust for a crispy bottom.

Wonderful recipe.  We loved it.  Unfortunately, I lost it and was sorry because I think this turns out much better.  I did make one change when I found it again - 1 cup of brown sugar instead of the white sugar.   It was the one thing my family took out of the temporary recipe.  It isnt necessary to have a good pue, just something that we liked.  Either way, this recipe us wonderful and firms nicely.

I made this recipe without any changes and I was a lil surprised at how good it was. I actually made two a thick one time and froze the other one and it even taste different better as if the ingredients may have claimed the pie and made it better.

This pie tasted like rotten milk to me, and 2 other people in my household also did not like it. I think this pie might have been okay without the added lemon juice, or maybe it was the mix of nutmeg and lemon together, I don't know. The only thing I changed was that I used 1/4 cup less sugar.

Easy to make and turns out great.   I added an equal amount of cinnamon because..why not.  It is typical southern sweet and a diabetics  nightmare, but I can see a no sugar version being almost as good.

Absolutley amazing!  Won second place in our pie contest.  What really helped was making the crust from scratch.  I left out the lemon and added cinnamon, everything else I followed the recipe.  Everyone loved it!

Wonderful, unique flavor and texture, my husband loved it.  When I make it again I'll cut the sugar a bit- we like less sugar, maybe 1 cup would do.  I made this with my first lard crust.  Holy cow!  I'll never buy Crisco again. Turned out to be the best pie I've ever made, and over the years I've made more than a few pies...

I've made a couple Buttermilk Pies before and then I lost the recipe for them. This recipe tastes great. Better than the one that I used before. It tastes great and is a crowd pleaser for my family......especially my son who thinks of himself as a pie aficionado.

I love this recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving. My husband doesn’t like nutmeg, so I tried something completely different. I added three dashes of cumin. It gave this pie a subtle kick that complimented the sweet bu wasn’t overwhelming.

I have made this several times and we love it. This time I took another baker's advice and substituted cinnamon in place of nutmeg. Also delicious!  I would post a picture but my pies always look like Allrecipes picture.

Delicious and easy to make. I baked pies for 65 min. I also sprinkled nutmeg on top before  baking. Next time I will cut the sugar back to 1 cup. It’s very sweet with 1 1/2 cups. I used deep dish pie crusts and made two pies so I could freeze one for later. Great dessert!

My 91 yr old grandmother mentioned this pie, eating it from when her mother had made it a very long time ago. Again had it in the Ozarks some thirty years ago. I had never heard of it till she said it one night. Being her health was diminishing I looked it up here and made it. It came out great and she said it reminded her of her mother back when she made it. That pie lasted only a couple of days before the family finished it off. Thanks for the recipe and making her day.

I had Buttermilk Pie for the first time at a restaurant in Sedona because it was their specialty. I liked it so much that I started searching for recipes and found that Chef John (someone I follow on Allrecipes) had one so made his for my first attempt.  While it turned out ok, it had way more lemon flavor than the one I was trying to copy. I tried this recipe on my second attempt & it was spot on! I followed the ingredients & directions to a T. It was very easy & very good.

I made homemade butter last night with my granddaughter and was looking for a recipe that I could use the leftover buttermilk in.  I ran across this pie and after reading several reviews I decided to use the basic recipe less 1/2 cup sugar since I don't like my desserts overly sweet.  This pie is the bomb!  It's a very simple pie to make and I let it cook until the center puffed up which was about 55 - 60 minutes.  I did place a foil tent over the pie about 45 minutes in due to the crust getting brown.  I used a frozen deep dish pie crust and the bottom of the pie crust also browned very nicely without pre-baking the crust. Once the pie cooled I ate a piece and then another piece.   Regarding flavor, it did not have too much lemon but I also used 100% natural lemon juice.  I misread the measurement for the nutmeg and used 1/8 tsp as apposed to 1/8 TBL in the recipe so I'll add a bit more the next time.  I can't imagine this pie with cinnamon so I think I'll stick with the nutmeg.

I made this pie with a slight change.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar as my husband is diabetic.  The pie was still delicious and held together firmly.  I strongly recommend using fresh nutmeg, not the canned mix.

I made this exactly as written. After 60 minutes in a fully preheated oven it was not fully set. To prevent further browning I did take it out of the oven, let it cool and refrigerate overnight. I am not pleased with the texture or flavor. I may have over eaten the eggs. Based on the reviews I will try it again to see if I may have done something wrong.

Turned out great just as the recipe calls for it. Just be sure to use a deep dish pie crust! The recipe doesn’t specify that, but it makes exactly enough to fill a 9”deep dish pie crust (I used Pillsbury frozen).

Baked for an hour and it was still runny on the inside. Taste was okay but next time I go to make a buttermilk pie I'll leave out the nutmeg and lemon. Those kind of threw the taste off for us.

i made it as directed the first time and it was good but made it again (and several more times) using cinnamon instead of nutmeg and baked on lowest rack as suggested in another review. i also cut sugar to 1 cup and used 3/4 cup white and 1/4 brown and 2 tbs lemon juice. we like it better with these changes. question: in every other buttermilk pie recipe i've seen it says to melt/cool butter, not just soften it. does it make a difference?

I'll need to try this recipe again. It is delicious, but the texture is messed up in the top ~1/3 of the pie. I think I over-baked it by keeping it in a full 60 minutes. Checking it at 40 minutes it was still liquid and at 50 minutes it still did not seem set. So note to myself and others -- I bet it'll set after removing it from the oven and allowing it to rest.

This is the second time I made this.  It's easy and I usually have the ingredients on hand.  It has been a hit each time with family & friends.  I prefer cinnamon to the nutmeg, but I usually make both.  Use a deep dish pie pan for a 9 inch pie.  It is also good without a crust in a ramekin!

This pie is wonderful and very easy to make!  I didn't have buttermilk so substituted 1/4C whole milk + 3/4C plain yogurt and it still turned out fantastic.  This pie is definitely going in my dessert portfolio.

I would cut down on the sugar a bit and it was not as firm as I would like either.   I did bake it for an hour.  The flavor was good though.  That said, I always appreciate that people would take the time to share their recipes.  Thank you.

The recipe called for too much sugar.  Considering how rich this is with the combination of buttermilk, butter and eggs, it did not require the full amount of sugar in the ingredients list.
Most of the guests were complaining it was too sweet as well.
If there is a next time, I would go down to 1 cup of sugar.

Best Buttermilk pie recipe! The hint of lemon makes a huge difference to the taste buds. Not overpowering, but just right. I do however lesson the amount of sugar to 1 cup and 2 tablespoons. 1 cup may be even better because 1 1/2 cups of sugar is quite a bit much and makes it too sweet. I use two 9" our crusts with this recipe.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe!   For years I heard my sister rave about buttermilk pie being her favorite but I never thought of making one myself until I came across this recipe in my feed here.   It was super easy to make and an instant favorite.   My husband’s favorite dessert has always been cheesecake, but he enjoyed this pie so much he ranked it as his now favorite!   I was really shocked!  This pie filling is sweet, but not too sweet and has a much lighter texture than I expected.   Thankfully, it really is a breeze to make, especially compared to cheesecake!   I made it just as written and won’t even attempt to tweak it...as they say, if it ain’t broke...

My husband grew up in the South and his mama made this kind of pie regularly. Ha gave this one high marks. Along with a cup of coffee, this was the perfect dessert to end a frigid day! I used a refrigerated pie crust, only 1 cup of sugar and substituted kefir for buttermilk.

Great recipe.  I’ll definitely make this again especially when I have leftover buttermilk from making biscuits or pancakes.  I didn’t have any lemon juice but added cinnamon to the recipe.  Velvety smooth and just the right amount by of sweetness. Everyone loved it!

This pie stands very well on its own without any needed changes. However I will say I use cinnamon instead of nutmeg because I don't want to spend $5 for a little thing of nutmeg.

Personally, I would use half the amount of lemon juice, but it still tasted great and baked perfectly.

Made this for Thanksgiving and followed the exact recipe.   It set well and looked amazing.  It was a huge disappointment. Not sweet enough - really disappointed since I had read so many of the positive reviews.

I added cinnamon to make this Thanksgiving ready.  It turned out great.  Everyone loved my addition.  The original recipe is fantastic as is.

I first made this a few years ago, it turned out perfect and only made one 9" pie. I used vinegar instead of lemon because that's how I remember it at my Tennessee MIL's. So sorry I can't find her recipe but I'm thrilled with this one. Getting ready to make it again only for Thanksgiving

My husband gave this pie 5 stars! I didn't have any buttermilk so I made my own with milk and vinegar. Followed instructions as written for mixing then cooked crust 5 minutes, microwaved filling 3 minutes ( as a reviewer mentioned to speed things up) then filled crust and baked 60 minutes . Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

I made no changes in the recipe.  Everyone loved it!  I made the recipe and divided the filling between 6 mini-pie plates.  The happy recipients of a small pie loved the presentation as well as the delicious custard filling.  The buttermilk tames the sweetness and makes this recipe very "comforting."

My family described this as "heaven on a spoon." I prevented overbrowning by wrapping foil around the crust. Also, I used both cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious! A new favorite.

The pie consistency was perfect, I baked it for 60 mins. 
There is a restaurant in my town that has the most amazing buttermilk pie, and I was hoping this one would be just as good, but sadly, it wasn't. And I think it's more about my distaste for buttermilk than anything else. I don't care for that sour taste... at all! 
The pie at the place here in town does not have even a slight sour taste, so perhaps they use regular milk? I might try using regular milk and see if we like that better. But other than that, I think if you like buttermilk, or don't mind that tangy flavor, its perfect. It came out beautifully.

Very sweet. Next time I will decrease sugar. I made buttermilk with mixture of 2% milk, a few tbsp of half and half and 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice because that saved a trip to the store. It still needed a bit more lemon. I love nutmeg so used 1/2 tsp. This was heavenly. Tasted like a light egg nog tapioca. Will make often now. Will try almond and rum extracts and perhaps almond milk. But wonderful just as simple as it is. Thanks for posting.

This is my go-to recipe for buttermilk pie. It is incredibly easy to make,  you don't have to make the crust. I do find the original recipe a tad too sweet so I've had to tone down the sugar.

I added this pie to my annual family pie extravaganza (in the interest of "life is short, eat dessert first" we get together for a pie feast the night before Thanksgiving.). Everyone liked it-- the general consensus was that it tasted like a light-textured cheesecake. My only challenge was testing for doneness. The center was still pretty wiggly even though the "clean knife" test showed it was done. I decided to trust the knife test and sure enough,  when the pie cooled it firmed up nicely.

Terrific recipe. I have made it so often that I have it memorized. It's my to go pie for potlucks, going to see a friend, weeknight desserts, and holiday gatherings. Great flavor and texture. Lightly sweet with good lemon flavor and subtle nutmeg. It's one of those old style pies that is nostalgic to people and as soon as they try it,  they remember why they love it.

Best recipe! These cookies are the best batch I have EVER made!  The only thing I can think of is that the butter is melted instead of at room temp which made the sugar melt as well.  Whatever it is, they're amazing!

This was good and ended up being more like an egg custard tasting pie. I generally like he old fashioned buttermilk pies but I'm glad I made this one.

Great buttermilk pie,  We have added whisky to the recipe but it really doesn't make it better or worse.  Its better in my mind without.

I made one with lemon juice and one without and I preferred the one without the lemon juice.  My coworkers who know what real southern cooking is loved this recipe.

Very easy to make.   I made it like the recipe stated-no changes except I used nutmeg from the spice aisle (and white eggs-not brown- LOL).  Turned out great and I loved the taste and texture.  I'll make it again!

Like those before me, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup (I couldn't imagine it any sweeter!); used 1T of corn starch and 2T of flour;  5T of butter instead of 8T; and the juice of 1/2 lemon (didn't care how it measured).  I also cooked the pie for 30 minutes at 350, then reduced the heat to 325 and cooked it for an additional 30 minutes (covered with a sheet of aluminum foil).

While someone else mentioned it wasn't fair to rate this recipe if the reviewer made a lot of changes, I just want  others to know it's a great recipe (and probably just as great with the original directions)--I just preferred to make it with less sugar and less fat.   

Whatever you decide to do--enjoy!

Good Lawd!! Been looking for this for a while. Tried others. This is the one. Made it exactly as per instructions.  Made it for the crew in the oil patch and they loved it. It is requested, no demanded about once a week now.  Some like more nutmeg some like less. Make several at a time and vary it a bit. A well received dish by one and all.

WAY TOO MUCH LEMON! I put less than the recipe called because of the reviews and the lemon was still overpowering. I will make this again, but I plan on using 1/2 or 1/4 teaspoon next time. Other than that it was a tasty and easy pie.

I made exactly according to recipe.  Sadly I just really do not like it...it's bland and so sweet it makes my teeth hurt.  I gave it 3 stars because the pie  turned out fine...all the consistencies were right and I guess if this is something you enjoy, it's a fine recipe.  It just wasn't to my taste.

I made 3 of these pies last week for our sr ctr lunch, my pies showed 3 distinct layers after baking.  I have no idea why, except that I do know it added to the look of the pie: crust, a yellow custard-y layer, then the brown topping.  It all amalgamated into a luscusious taste on the tongue.  I cut back the sugar slightly and replaced about 1/4 of the remaining amount  with sugar substitute. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Used Never, Never Fail Pie Pastry from AR - perfect.

I scaled back the receipe to serve 6 persons and that fit very well into a single pie crust.  It is sweet, but as my husband says - it is dessert, it is supposed to be sweet.  This was very tasty and well received at the dinner table.  I will make it again,  and freeze the extra, if only to use up the buttermilk that I bought just for this recipe.

Made exactly as directed (well, ok, I forgot the nutmeg and subbed 1/2 T vinegar since I didn't have lemon juice), but it was delicious. The texture was a bit weird at first, but everyone loved it and I'd definitely make again.

I had never made a buttermilk pie before, and this is so good!  I used cinnamon because that's all I had.  I covered the edges of the crust through the entire baking.   Baked in a glass pie pan for 60 minutes.  Crust was very brown but not burnt.  I loved the crunchy top and creamy filling!

I loved it, family loved it and it has been the first desert to be finished off. Great recipe. I'm about to make it a 4th time, but I only have half a stick of butter, going to try and use some heavy cream. I will let everyone know how it goes.

I loved the consistency of the pie and it was super-easy to make!  The issues for me were its being so sweet that I couldn't take in more than a few bites and that the center would not "set" in any resemblance to the cooking time noted.  I'm not into "healthy" if it interferes with taste, so the butter, fat, etc. is all great with me- but I do think I am going to cut the sugar by a third, add an egg yolk and season it more to our taste.  Everyone who ate it made the same remarks, "wow, that's too sweet" and then would usually say it tasted too lemony.  By reducing the lemon juice and replacing the rest with vanilla, reducing the sugar considerably, and increasing the nutmeg (with a little dash of cinnamon), I think this will be more to our taste.  I did not have an y problems with the crust, as others did, but I also baked it on the lower shelf in the oven to prevent this.  Great pie, just be careful you LOVE sugar if you are sticking with the original recipe!

I'm going to take the suggestion of debbyc1026 and try setting the filling before adding it to the crust. The lack of doneness in the center was a miss, and it tasted a tad too lemon-y.  I think I'll reduce the lemon juice, add an extra egg yolk and maybe a pinch more flour to se if that also "gets it right" for my palate next time.  Super easy recipe; thanks for posting!

I made the recipe as written, and I ended up with a huge pool of butter in the middle of the pie before it was finished baking. I pulled the pie out of the oven and poured off most of the butter and put it back in to complete the baking process. The pie ended up with a huge crater in the middle. it tasted okay but I turned around and made it again this time omitting the butter and the pie turned out beautiful. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem but I think the only thing I did different was I nuked the butter a little bit too long in the microwave and it was melted by the time I poured it into the mixer rather than just softened and as a recipe called for. if the photo I uploaded attaches to this review, the pie in the foreground is the second batch and  the pie in the background was the first go around.

This is a wonderful recipe. To avoid over browning, make a foil tent over the pie. You can remove just before pie is done to brown more if you like.

I personally though it was too heavy, but that could just be because it's a buttermilk pie.

While this tasted amazing and came out looking very nice, this recipe makes way too much for a regular 9-inch pie shell. I wasted probably 3/4 of a cup. This must be a deep-dish recipe. If used with a deep-dish crust, this would turn out perfectly.

This was my first time trying buttermilk pie, and my husband and toddler thought it was delicious. I found it a little bit greasy, but that's maybe because it wasn't cool enough?

Tried this recipe bt added 1 1/2 table spoon custard powder in the mixture. Also pre cooked the pie else I would have burnt the cream part of my pie. Yes a bit too sweet bt for sure will try it with less sugar.

EXTREMELY SWEET!!! The sugar could have been nearly reduced to half. Frankly, we do not understand all of the rave reviews. Apparently many people like extremely sweet pie. Gave 1/2 of it to the neighbor who told me that maybe this is a recipe that should be skipped. I will.

Has a light tang and creamy, custardy consistency that is a winning combination. I used store-bought pie crust to make it easier to go together. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup raw honey for nutrition and to make it slightly less sweet. It turned out beautifully.

You can't rate this anything but a 5 star!  It's a firehall favorite.  It buries chess AND custard pie although a lot alike.  The buttermilk adds what the other two are missing!

I love love love this recipe. It's so simple and easy to make! I made my first pie a week ago and split it in half and sent the other half with my husband to my mother in laws house, her opinion matters lol. My sister in law and mother in law loved it but complained that it was a little to sweet. And I have to agree. I am about to make two other pies tonight and am def using less sugar. But other than that YUM!!

Great texture and taste. I think the lemon helped to balance out all the sweetness. I made it with cinnamon instead of nutmeg because that's all I had. I covered the crust edge with strips of foil to prevent the crust from burning before the rest of the pie cooked. There was no left overs so as soon as I got home I made another one!

Good basic recipe!  You can also add a child's handful of pecans (the pieces work great) to the batter before pouring in pie shells or fruit.  I like that the additions provide varying texture to a pie such as this.

This recipe is a hit everywhere I take it. Most folks have never tried it and ask for the recipe.
I make mine totally in the blender. The eggs blend smoothly with everything else and it comes together so quickly before I pour it into my prepared, unbaked pie crust.

Great flavor. Would probably not add the lemon juice next time. Maybe just a few sprinkles would do, but a whole tablespoon was a bit too much in my opinion. Most likely (as long as crust isn't burning) you will need to cook this for the WHOLE 60 minutes. Overall, a delicious pie!

I too used cinnamon and I will cut back on the amount next time.  I also cut back on the sugar.  It was alittle to sweet for me.  But my son loved it.  I will make again though.

Best buttermilk pie recipe I have tried, and I tried a few! I did leave out the lemon and 2 teaspoon vanilla and cinnamon instead of nutmeg. What really impressed me was the creamy texture that I was not getting in other recipes, nice!

This was amazing.  I never have even heard of buttermilk pie so I no idea what to expect.  I used a deep dish pie pan with a store bought crust and it came out awesome.  Followed the recipe exactly even the cooking time.  Would not change a thing.  I'll be making this for the next picnic.

Excellent. ..Tastes better as the days go by if you can keep it that long.  I double the recipe and reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Wonderful, wonderful pie

Delicious! Even without vanilla or lemon juice. I used a 9 inch pie pan, it took 60 minutes. I made this gluten free by subbing the flour part w/ 2 Tbl of white rice flour and 1 Tbl of cornstarch, and used gluten free crust. I did add chopped pecans to it. It was really pretty too. I will definitely make it again.

My first attempt, and I'm a believer! I used the very small tin foil pie plates, which worked well. That's because I only had 1/3 cup of buttermilk left over! Question-- Should I have baked it until it was as dark as the picture, or is that something else sprinkled on top?

This buttermilk pie is wonderful, however, I would leave off the lemon juice and sliced lemon.  It's meant to be sweet.  Also, to keep the crust from burning around the edges, when it browns about halfway through cooking time, put thin strips of foil on top of the crust edges.  That way you want to eat every bite.

Good, but next time I'll leave out the nutmeg. It was too overpowering and distracting for my taste. When I try again, I'll probably increase the lemon flavor instead.

Excellent (and super easy) pie! Kind of a cross between a pumpkin pie and a blondie. I used half white sugar and half dark brown sugar to give it a more carmelized flavor.

Me and my wife made a 12" pie and it was good, everyone loved it.  I added some cinnamin to it.  Then we made a 9" pie without cinnamon, with cinnamin was a little better I though.

Great recipe---super easy, great flavor and texture, something out of the ordinary.  One thing I noticed though, the nutmeg taste gets a little intense after being in the refrigerator for a couple days.  Best eaten cold on first or second day.

Was OK - not the same texture or flavor from Texas I am familiar with, but would do a variation of it next time.

The filling was very tasty but ended up coming out more quiche like than custard like.  Not at all creamy like ones I've had in the past.
