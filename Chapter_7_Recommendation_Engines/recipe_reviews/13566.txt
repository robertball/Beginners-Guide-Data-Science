This is such a delicious quick bread. I really like the suggestion of one reviewer who wrote that she left the cranberries whole... that way you get the maximum flavor. I quess my only (very small) complaint about this bread was that I wanted more cranberries. I would probably double the amount next time. Thank you Karin for submitting this recipe!

p.s. I made another batch and baked it as mini loaves... recipe made 4; they were done in 25 min.... love this recipe!

This bread was wonderful!  After greasing the pan, I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar in the pan to give the crust a sweet crunch.  I sprinkled some extra chopped walnuts and some "sugar in the raw" on top before baking, and it really does look like a picture!  Tastes great and a beautiful holiday bread.  Takes no time to whip together too!

Excellent and Easy.  This is the recipe on the back of the cranberry bags.  Other than doubling the amount to 2 cups of berries and keeping them whole, I don't change a thing.  Don't overbake. 50 min. exactly is right.  If the dough is too stiff, add a few tablespoon of milk to moisten it up. TIP - for a prettier bread, place some cranberries on top of the batter before you bake it.  The red color on top adds a gorgeous appearance to the bread. I also glaze mine with a lemon glaze. The glaze gives it a little tart flavor on top and keeps the bread moist. (glaze - lemon juice and powdered sugar).  Glaze while warm.

Very tasty, fruity bread.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in "little loaf" pans, 5 3/4 x 3 x 2 1/8, for 30 minutes.  It made 5 little loaves.

This bread was fabulous! I thought that the orange flavor, from the juice AND zest, might be a bit strong, but it wasn't--it complimented the tang of the cranberries beautifully, so don't skimp on the orange zest...I took other reviewers' advice and used whole cranberries (increased to 1 1/4 cup) and it was perfect.  Looks beautiful and tastes moist and flavorful--well worth making.

This is so good!  I made it on Thanksgiving day, and everyone love it.  My husband love it so much that he went to the market to grab me 2 more bags of cranberries. ^^ I also try to make it using the muffin pan and baked in the oven for about 22 mins, and it came out good as well.

SUGGESTIONS: you can add one more egg if you want, or increase the amount of cranberries, or decrease the sugar to add some tablespoon of orange juice concentrate ! Delicious !

Absolutely amazing recipe! My husband asks for this weekly now! I made, as written with the following changes; I added 1/3 cup brown sugar, doubled the cranberried and left them whole. I also made a simple glaze with orange juice and powdered sugar. Truly my top 5 favorite recipes, EVER! Thank you!

Unbelievable recipe! I didn’t have fresh cranberries so I substituted Craisins, soaking them in the OJ to bring them back to life. I also used a combination of Splenda (6 packets) and brown sugar (1/2 cup) in place of the white sugar. I didn’t have orange zest so I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger. I also used applesauce in place of the oil, making the bread even tastier! I made mini muffins rather than a loaf of bread and I baked them at 350 for 22 minutes. I will be making a SECOND batch later tonight! Yum!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.  I've been making breads of all types for over 40 yrs and this is absolutely the best Cranberry Nut bread I've ever tasted.  It is MOIST - truly.  The addition of Orange zest and juice makes all the difference.  I coursely chopped the cranberries and used the zest of a whole orange.  I cheated and used 2 tblsp of frozen oj making sure the liquids came to almost 1 cup.  It was perfect.  this will be my go-to forever.  Thanks Karin for discovering this wonderful equation of ingredients.

Very good!  The orange flavor really comes through and enhances the bread's flavor.  I used dried cranberries ("Craisins") and it was great.  To add a little something extra to the finished bread, I made a glaze of powdered sugar, orange juice and some orange extract and drizzled it over the top.  This is a great treat to make at holiday time - I'll bake it up again!

Delicious and moist. I like this a lot. I had to omit the walnuts because I didn't have them and I replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil. I used 1/2 of a banana mashed with 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to replace the egg and make this a vegan bread. My substitution worked well so I recommend this for anyone with an egg allergy too.

Big hit at our holiday party.  The only addition I made was dark chocolate chips.  According to everyone there that's what made the two loaves I made disappear in no time..

Very tasty - I would make again. I didn't have any orange juice, so I used the liquid drained from a can of mandarin oranges plus 1 teaspoon of orange flavor.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup since canned fruit has extra sugar added to it.  I used one tablespoon of melted butter instead of the 2 tablespoons of oil.  I baked it in a silicone loaf pan and it took 65 minutes.

I gave it 4 stars since I made several changes.  First I increased the berries to 1-1/2 cups and left them whole.  Next I added an additional egg and 3 Tbsp. of sour cream as several people commented the bread was dry and/or crumbly.  I also increase the sugar by 1/4 cup.  I made an orange/powdered sugar drizzle to go on top.  Wow, what a wonderful treat, hubby and I had 2 slices for breakfast when it came out of the oven.  Definitely a keeper for the holiday season.

Delicious!  and I "healthed it up" by using whole wheat flour, about half the sugar, and 1/4 cup applesauce instead of the oil (although it's, not much oil so that doesn't matter much).

Delicious! The orangy flavor added just the right hint of lightness. The reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because I had to add about another 1/4 cup of OJ to make it the proper consistency. It was more like a cookie dough before I did, and would not spread in the pan. I baked it in a brownie pan because I didn't want it to be super thick and it came out fabulous in about 40 minutes. Will definitely be making this again.

I've made something very similar to this, although I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and skipped the zest. This also works w/ half whole wheat flour.

I used all whole wheat flour and turbinado sugar and it came out really, really tasty. I also only happened to have extra virgin olive oil on hand, but I really wanted to make the bread so I went with it, and actually I liked the very, very faint, delicate flavor that it added. I didn't have a problem with the bread not rising, even with the whole wheat flour. Next time, I might use a full 2 cups of chopped fresh cranberries. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good bread.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on it before I baked it and it was excellent.  The only thing was it was a bit dry.  I would have liked a little more moisture.

This tasted really great.  It was a bit more crumbly than I would have liked, however.  Difficult to cut into slices.  Think that I will try a different recipe next time.

I made mini loaves to put in gift baskets that I made this year. Every one really liked them. It was very tasty and easy to make.

This turned out GREAT.  It will replace my old recipe for Cranberry Nut Bread.  It is so moist. The orange juice adds great flavor to it. Usually the cranberries in my breads seem a bit tart, but this recipe they are much sweeter. I think the orange juice flavoring helps to cover up the tartness of the cranberries.

A bit too dry in my opinion... & a bit too "orangey" tasting for me. Also had problems with it not baking all the way through in the middle. Probably won't try this one again.

This bread is amazing! Loved it! I put in whole cranberries, and used two reader's tips: sprinkling cinnamon and sugar in the baking pan before adding the batter and I also sprinkled more nuts and some brown sugar on top! Yumm!

I'm going to make this for some friends for Xmas but one of them is vegan. Any ideas on egg substitution?

this is lovely bread---i added some vanilla and almond extract, and used almonds in place of walnuts.  I sprinkled some raw sugar on top and it came out wonderfully.  I didn't bother to chop the cranberries---like little bursts of flavor;  terrific!  thanks for the recipe!! EDIT: to add that i made mine using granulated Splenda and Egg Beaters---worked great!

This is a very moist, tasty bread! With it's tangy cranberry pieces, crunchy nuts, and more than just a hint of orange flavor, this bread was a hit at coffee hour at our church. It is also pretty healthy, compared to most quick breads, with less than a cup of sugar and only 2 tbs. of oil. It is also super easy to make. I made the bread exactly as written, and the only problem I had was that the "batter" was super thick. I don't think it caused any problems, but it made stirring a bit difficult. Other than that, this is a delicious, wholesome bread that I will be making again! Thanks for sharing!

I've had much better cranberry breads.  I made this according to the recipe as I don't think it's fair to rate or review a recipe when you've modified it.  (I do modify things all of the time, but then I don't rate them.)

This is something I don't mind eating myself, but I will not be serving it for company.

I decided to take a chance and bake this recipe in my bread machine (Williams-Sonoma). I put the wet ingredients straight into the bread machine pan and then mixed the dry ingredients and added them. Used the Quick Bread cycle, kept my eye on it and then took it out 20 min before cycle was up. Put it under my regular oven broiler to brown up the top a bit.. only a few minutes. I used 1 cup dried cranberries and 1 cup chopped pecans. Just tried a slice and it turned out great!!!! Nice and moist inside with a beautiful crust outside.  Will be excellent tomorrow morning for breakfast. Thanks for sharing Karin!

I got a lot of complements on this bread. It was tangy and delicious. I used pecans instead of walnuts and cut the sugar a bit. I also used a stick of butter instead of oil which made it more cake-like.

Although my bread came out a bit too tart but still very good, I must give this recipe the five stars it deserves.  It is moist with just the perfect hint of sweetness.  The next time I make it, I won't use to heaping cups of whole cranberries....maybe just one heaping cup...LOL!!!

This recipe was super easy and the bread was very good. I used pecans instead of walnuts and baked in 3 small loaf pans instead of 1 regular loaf.  I'll make this bread again.

This is almost identical to the classic Ocean Spray recipe I've used for years.  It's better with an extra half cup of cranberries, though, and I much prefer using pecans instead of walnuts.

This turned out perfectly and was very easy to make. However, I found the sweetness from the orange zest, juice, cranberries and sugar too overwhelming. Maybe it was because I used dried cranberries. My guests liked it though.

This bread came out perfect.  I had no problems with it being flat; it rose perfectly and looked like a picture.  I did not have enough orange so I added tangerine peel to make the full tablespoon.  It was very moist and not crumbly at all.  The citrus added a wonderful overtone.  I have this recipe in my box and this is the one I'll use when I make cranberry bread.

In response to Timkerbell:  It sounds like the bread was not done.  Try the toothpick test.  When you think the bread is about done, put a toothpick in the center and pull it back out.  There should be little to no crumbs on it.  If it's gooey, then it's definitely not done.  Adjust the temperature and baking time for your oven - ovens vary. I hope that helps.

I've made this 5 times.  It tastes great but it doesn't rise.  It fact it falls in the middle.  I have new baking powder and new soda.  Have tried a metal pan, a glass pan, and a new Baker's secret pan. I don't overstir it. I did add 1/4 cup sugar, and used whole grain pastry flour instead of white flour. Does anyone know what the problem is?

Here are my mods: 1/2 c sugar, butter instead of oil, 2 c whole cranberries, 1 c walnuts, zest of 2 oranges. I made per the recipe first and it's good but the mods above were how I tailored to our family's taste. I also have made in mini loaf pans and they seem pretty perfect at 25 min in a 325 degree convection.

Made this with leftover Fresh cranberries from the holidays. Wasn't sure what to expect, but the flavor was amazing! I think next time I will add more cranberries, and a tad more sugar, but it was very good nonetheless.

Pretty good.  As a bread loaf difficult to cut(starts to crumble).  made with 1 1/4 c of cranberries whole.  Topped w/ sprinkle of sugar and pumpkin spice which was nice.  Nice change for the holiday.

Delicious!  I followed other suggestions and added an extra 1/4 cranberries and kept them whole.

This is a wonderful recipe and it turned out very good. I was a bit worried about it being too dry with only 2 Tbs. of oil in it, so I added an additional 2 Tbs. of oil. I also needed to use up an apple that had been hanging around too long, so I grated the peeled apple into the batter as well. I didn't have fresh cranberries (and didn't want to run to the store), so I reconstituted 3/4 cup dried in a bit of water to sub for the fresh. Thank you again for the awesome recipe!

This bread was way too dry for my liking.  It was near crumbly when trying to cut it.  I added an orange glaze to try and combat the dryness, but it didn't really help.  It's really too bad because the flavor was great.  I loved the tart cranberries and crunchy nuts.  I did follow this recipe exactly baking it in mini loaf pans because my intention was to give one as a gift.  I think that baking in a larger pan for an even longer time would have made it even dryer. Needless to say, I made a different bread for the gift.

I've been making this for a few months now and it's my favorite quick bread recipe.  I use half white flour and half whole wheat for extra fiber.  I also add the cranberries whole instead of chopping and the bread comes out perfectly!  It's great with a little butter or cream cheese and has become a Sunday morning staple for us!

This came out a bit crumbly, but wonderful with added walnuts.  I like that out of all the cranberry bread recipes on this site (most of which are more or less the same), this one has less sugar and less fat.  It still tastes wonderful.

Very tasty. I used frozen cranberries and wholemeal flour and as I didn't have any oranges I substituted apple juice. Very successful.

It tasted awesome but was a little dry. I'll probably try 2 more tablespoons of orange juice next time. I also didn't realize the cranberries weren't supposed to be whole but I think it turned out more flavorful that way.

This bread is incredible!  I did make a few changes: omitted nuts (allergies); added extra cranberries, halved; used 3 tbsp of oil instead of 2, since some reviews said it was dry; and added a glaze of confectioner's sugar and orange juice.  Came out moist and DELICIOUS!  I might try reducing the orange zest just a little and adding vanilla next time, since I like it just a LITTLE sweeter/less tart, but overall it was wonderful.  This is now my go-to recipe for cranberry orange bread!

Very very good!  I made mini loaves in my pan, which makes 8, and baked for 40 minutes.  I had leftover cinnamon sugar from muffins I was making, so I added the sugar on top of the mini loaves.  I also used dried cranberries bc I was too lazy to defrost the cranberries I have in the freezer.  Excellent bread.  Thank you!  I love the orange and cranberry flavor together.

Delicious. I used a heaping tablespoon of the orange zest, but other than this, I followed the recipe as shown. 50 minutes in the oven was just right, and it came out moist and not crumbly. Will definitely make this again.

At last-I've been looking for a good Cranberry Bread recipe and I finally found it! I had lemon peel instead of orange and and it still came out great. Oh-and I tented it with foil the last few minutes. No other changes. Thanks for sharing!

I agree with another poster...this is similar to, if not the same as the recipe on the cranberry bag. That said, it is a great recipe and the comments from various cooks about what makes the recipe a success is what makes Allrecipes my favorite, go-to recipe website. I added additional cranberries, some chopped and some whole, used applesauce in place of the oil and found my oven had the bread done in 40 minutes. I will continue to use this recipe as my go to when I need cranberry bread.

I made this by the recipe but used zest from Cuties and for the juice used Dole's mandarin oranges in 100% juice, chopped up in the juice. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I also used raw sugar.  It just came out of the oven about 15 min ago. It is delicious,  but I feel like it should be a little more moist, with butter added to the recipe.

Easy and good tasting. I doubled the recipe and it made 6 small loves in those little paper pans. 5 loaves would have been a little better, as they were not full to the top  of the pan with 6.

Delicious! I made my own orange juice using navel oranges and substituted the walnuts for pecans! I also used frozen whole cranberries because it was all I had.. I think that's why mine took a little longer than 50 mins to bake (more like 70 mins). Very good :)

Easy, moist and will make again. The only thing I did that the recipe did not suggest to do was to toast the walnuts in the preheated oven for about 8 minutes or until you start to smell them.

OK, so after reading a ton of these great reviews, here's what I came away with.. and it works out wonderfully! I doubled the recipe (I mean, who only wants one loaf!), using 3 eggs instead of 2, 3T of oil instead of 2, added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. Once the batter was in the pans prior to baking, I placed a few cranberries and nut pieces directly on top, then sprinkled the loaf with sugar-in-the-raw. All of these were suggestions I garnered from reading numerous reviews. Thanks to the allrecipes.com community for taking a great recipe and perfecting it!

Excellent recipe...a tad dry, but it could be me..... Nothing a little butter can't fix! 
I sliced the cranberries for a prettier look, photo doesn't show that.

So GOOD!  I love the tartness of this bread.  It was delicious toasted with butter  and a cup of coffee for breakfast.  Gave to my neighbors as a Christmas "gift" and several have called asking for the recipe.  I did add 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1 tbsp cinnamon and a few dashes of nutmeg, mainly because I like these ingredients in my sweet breads.  I will certainly be making this every year!!

Certainly not bad, but not my favorite. The flavor didn't quite pop the way I wanted it to. Found an even better recipe on this very site though-- check out Cranberry Nut Bread II, it'll totally blow your hair back.

So great! My first time making Cranberry bread and here's the changes I made: 2 cups of whole cranberries. Since there was such little oil asked for I skipped it and just added a splash of Almond Milk to help the dough come together. So good!

I selected this recipe to make mini loaves to accompany holiday cookies for my neighbors. I have to agree with several who had stated it was a very dry, crumbly bread. The flavor is sufficient. After reviewing the ingredients, I was concerned the wet to dry ratio would result in a dry end product. I was right.

I substituted Craisins for fresh cranberries. Used 2 cups of Craisins that had been reconstituted prior to adding to mix. To reconstitute cover Craisins with water in a pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, then let sit in the water for 5 minutes. Drain before using. And I added one peeled and grated Granny Smith apple. Wonderful bread!!

Bread came out tasty but a little dry and crumbly. I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, 2 cups of whole cranberries and the orange zest was from a spice jar. The rest of the ingredients were exactly as listed in the original recipe. When I poured the wet into the dry ingredients, it became very apparent that there wasn't quite enough "wet" to blend. But I got the job done. Bread was done in 50 minutes, which is unusual for my "slow" oven. The first piece was warm and delicious. But the next morning it was a bit dry and crumbly. A bit disappointing. Next time I will try another reviewers suggestion and add a second egg. I will also check it around 48 minutes in the oven.  The flavor of this recipe is really good, but it does need some tweaking.

I took the advise and doubled the cranberries and another egg, sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar on top (I forgot to do it in the pan), and it came out great! I picked tons of cranberries this season and this recipe will be made again and again!

This bread had flavor with the cranberries and orange juice without being too sweet.  Moist...company arrived just after it came out of the oven and was gone before it was completely cool.  A hit at our house.

Not impressed, unfortunately. I had such high hopes, but this was on the bland side. I will give high marks for being moist and attractive when sliced, but it just wasn't very tasty, though I followed the recipe to a T. I'll keep looking for a more flavorful recipe.

Best Cranberry bread ever!!! Husband & kids said WOW! Used great suggestions from others, such as 2 cups whole cranberries, cinnamon sugar in the greased stones, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon and the lemon glaze.  AWESOME!  My son said make it all the time.  Enjoy All and Happy Holidays!

This recipe is great! I only change it slightly - instead of orange juice, I use one small bottle (200ml) of San Pellegrino Aranchiata and the juice from the orange that I used for making the zest.

just cut it warm and it is fabulous.  nhot too sweet with all kinds of hints of flavors.  Will do this again with all kinds of other tart fruits, cherries, raspberries, blueberries.  This could even take a streusel topping as well.

Next time I'll use half of the orange zest.  Maybe add some buttermilk to make it a little more moist.

Wasn't sure how this would come out as I used wheat flour and orange marmalade in place of juice/rind but it came out FABULOUS!

Delicious cranberry bread - I added extra cranberries & left them whole per others suggestion & it came out perfect. Orange juice/zest added a nice tang. This is likely to be our go to cranberry bread recipe from now on. Thanks!

Very dry. I was unable to find fresh cranberries at the grocery store, so I used a 6 oz. package of Craisins. The dough was so dry, I ended up added an additional egg as some other reviewers suggested. Still very dry. Lacks flavor. Maybe a little vanilla and additional vegetable oil would have helped? I'm not sure. Won't try this recipe again.

Wow, what a wonderful treat! I "healthified" it (as I do most recipes) and it still came out delicious! I used 1c sweetened, dried cranberries (which I soaked in boiling water for 5 minutes to plump up), 1c whole wheat flour, 1/2c whole wheat pastry flour, and 1/2c all-purp flour. I also added 1/4c wheat bran for more fiber. I only used 1/4c white sugar and 1/4c brown, and it was plenty sweet! Next time, I'll be sure to use a WHOLE 1T of orange zest (I skimped!), FRESH orange juice, and whole cranberries, which I know will make this bread that much more scruptious!

Very good bread recipe.  Nice and moist.  The orange zest made the flavor!  I only sliced my cranberries in half...we like the burst of tart cranberry flavor.  Thanks for a keeper!

This is the best bread.  Great for a gift, for breakfast, potluck...any event!  Pretty easy to do.  Helpful if you have a chopper to dice the cranberries.  Recommend adding an additional tbsp of oil for moisture.

This was ok. I thought it was going to be sweeter but it really wasn't that sweet at all. I don't know if it was the cranberries I used, but it really wasn't that great. I may try it again and make a sugar coating around the outside.

This is a perfect bread.  I made two for gifts, just on the advice of other readers and they looked and smelled so perfect, I made two more.  Delicious and easy, but looks like you slaved over the hot stove.  Thank you!

Yum!  I didn't have orange juice, so I juiced fresh oranges and  left my cranberries whole.  The flavor is DELICIOUS!  It's a little too crumbly, so I'm only giving it 4 stars, maybe with another egg or a little more oil it wouldn't fall apart so much.  Overall, it's a great recipe!  Thank you!

I made some alteration, but still found this recipe lacking something.  I added 1c. sugar and more cranberries and nuts.  Made it for Thanksgiving and my parents liked it very much.  I think it could have used a glaze of powdered sugar and orange juice.  I ate it cold with cold Oranged Cranberry Sauce from this site and it was good.  As an aside, cranberries are tough to chop!  I don't have a food processor so I might leave them whole next time.

The bread was very moist. The flavors all worked but the cranberries were a bit too tart. I will take the time to really chop them finely next time around.

Very moist, flavorfull bread, but too sweet for me, so I'll cut back on the sugar next time.  I cut it back to 1/2 c. this time, but needs to be cut back more.  I also added 1/4 c. ground flaxseed for nutrition.

Came out tasty but not as sweet as I would have liked. This could have been because we were out of orange juice so I had to squeeze my own from a couple of oranges that weren't overly sweet. Also, use a sharp knife to cut the bread otherwise it will crumble.

I've never made Cranberry Bread before but certainly plan to again.  My husband and I loved it!  Since he's not a berry fan I didn't even think he would try it and was so glad  he did!  It took me a while to "grate" the orange peel, since I don't own a zester.  The orange and cranberry taste were a match made in heaven.  I'm planning to purchase a zester since I know I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

This bread is incredible.  We have an international student living with us who is very picky about what he eats, and he rated this "GREAT!"  Others we have baked for this Christmas have also given it rave reviews.  Many thanks!  P.S.  I did use the zest; it was fantastic.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving!  My husband is allergic to gluten (in wheat), so I substituted brown rice flour and 1-1/2 teaspoons of xanthan gum for the wheat flour, and it was still very yummy!

Be sure to make two loaves - my only loaf disappeared from the table within minutes!

I love the fact that this recipe calls for only 2 tbsp of oil - I've read a couple cranberry bread recipes that require 1/2 cup shortening per loaf! I used only 1 tbsp oil, left out the nuts and the salt, and I mushed a banana into the batter because I read a couple reviews stating that the bread turns out dry. I love how it turned out. I've had a freezer full of cranberries for months, and I finally know their fate!

Couldn't be better.  I used whole frozen cranberries and substituted about half of the white flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  The orange flavor is heavenly.

I think it's probably my fault.  I might have messed up on the orange zest part. i peeled the out side of the orange, 1 tbsp full.  It didn't tatse so good....I'm inexperienced it was probably something I did.

FABULOUS! I have always used my mother's recipe to make this bread but couldn't find it this year. This bread is just as good, even better. Nice and moist and full of flavor. I always add more cranberries and nuts than called for. Thanks Karin, for sharing your wonderful recipe!

I made this recipe into muffins!  I did take the advice from a previous poster and doubled the cranberries ( used 2 cups).  I also used a 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 c chopped walnuts, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon mixed together and placed on top of the muffins before baking.  They are absolutely perfect!

I made the recipe as written, I added about 1/3 more cranberries. I also added a splash of cream as the batter seemed a little dry. Topped these mini muffins with sparkling large sugar crystals. I baked them for 10 minutes and cooked at a higher temperature for a nice dome. Perfect for a Christmas gift basket.

So we baked one in a ceramic loaf pan and one loaf in an aluminum  disposeable pan, which was a bit smaller.  Ironically, the larger one got overcooked and dried out.   It was still good.   The smaller loaf was not dry but rather quite moist.  My daughter said she was worried it was not done when she took it out but it was perfect.   It was excellent, basic cranberry orange bread.    So watch the cook time- i think that might explain some of the reviews that mentioned dryness.      Overall, really delicious, but I wouldn’t say fool-proof.   I could picture trying A few more recipes...and perhaps coming back to this one.  We’ll see.

I reduced the salt to 1/2t. and cut the cranberries in half with kitchen shears. All ingredients were mixed according to the directions. The batter is a little thick, so I 'm glad I blended everything by hand and didn't  risk over mixing it with an electric mixer. The batter filled three Pampered Chef mini loaf pans. Bake for 35-40 minutes.

I love this bread. I followed the recipes as is. I did take someone’s recommendation and I put cinnamon sugar around the bread pan after greasing it. It gave a lovely sweet taste which helped to balance out the tartness of the cranberries.

Easy, quick and delicious! The only change to the recipe I made was I used frozen whole cranberries instead. I didn’t chop them. The zest got left out because I didn’t have an orange. I used 3 small loaf pans and 40 min. baking time. First time making this recipe, it certainly won’t be the last! Yum Yum Yummy!

This recipe is lacking moisture and I needed to add 1/4 cup milk to be able to mix in the amount of flour asked for. The flavor is great with the orange zest in it to complement the cranberries.

Needs a touch more moisture...I added 1/4 c pineapple juice (what I had onhand) and check for doneness @ 45-50 minutes...or bread could be dry. I make this every holiday season for all of my friends and neighbors....Will also make 3  small foil pans of bread!

Our all time favorite quick bread!  Have been making this for years (although didn’t originally get the recipe here), and everyone who tries it really likes it.  I don’t make any changes at all ... every ingredient is important to the overall flavor.  I chop my cranberries in a food processor, and one bag will make enough for three loaves.  I did use some mini bread pans today for the first time ... one batch went into eight 3 1/2 x 2 1/2 loaves ... the kind that come as a single pan with 8 individual loaves.  (Honestly, those are too small ... almost like a large muffin.) Those baked for 23 minutes.  The second batch was a pan that made 4 loaves ... each was about 5 1/2 x 3 1/2 ... that’s a much better size!  Those took about 35 minutes.  (Notes for my future reference, but might help someone else who’s trying to figure out how to make these on mini pans.)

This turned out to be a great recipe although I did tweak it a little. I have never made this bread before. Some changes I made: I used a full cup of orange juice, 1.5 - 2 tablespoons of orange zest, a full teaspoon of salt,  a full cup of chopped walnuts, and a cup and a half of halved cranberries. I buttered the inside of the pan. VERY flavorful and moist bread.

Quick and easy recipe!  Very delicious.  I made muffins instead of bread for quicker baking time.

Really liked it as made, but think that it would be even better with a couple of changes.  First, I followed somebody else’s advise  and left the cranberries whole.  Other than that I made it exactly as written, but would add cinnamon and grated orange rind next time.
Thanks for the great idea!

This is so good. I did what other reviewers did - kept the berries whole. Also, I didn’t add nuts inside, but added a walnut, raw sugar, cinnamon crumble to the top, and a little cinnamon/sugar to the bottom of the pan. I am going to make these to give guests to take home on Thanksgiving.

Very nice! A refreshing bread. You might think, "whoah now, that's a lot of orange in my bread," but it works. I had to leave it baking about 20 more minutes until it was fully cooked, but that might have just been my oven. My only complaint was that the nuts keep the flour inside of them, and while the taste doesn't change, it make the appearance look a little eh. Really quick, unique taste, and the people I gave it to loved it.

Mine turned out very dry.  I knew something was amiss when the batter was super tight.  And I went against my philosophy of only using butter, with the belief that oil would make the bread super moist.  Disappointed.  It still takes good of course, but just didn't yield the expected result.

This bread is a keeper!  I followed the recipe, sans the orange zest, and per other reviewer's suggestion, I used a total of 1 cup of orange juice. The bread had a hint of orange flavor, as advertised, and tasted better each day till it was gone on the third.
I baked the bread for 65 minutes and put foil over the top of the bread for 15 minutes after I took it out of the oven. The bread was moist, and the top was yummy sticky.
The only changes that I'll make next time are add orange zest and add more cranberries.

This is almost the same as my old recipe.  I use no oil I use 2 tablespoon butter..  I use 2 cups of cranberries chop them real rough and add some to top before baking.  .  I use a cup of rough chopped walnuts.  I also use the rind from one large orange and squeeze the juice from that orange but add some to make the 3/4 cup.  
Great and moist recipe.  Can make muffins with same recipe.
Enjoy!! Nana

This is really good.  I doubled it, so I could freeze a loaf for after my baby gets here.  Delicious!  I would not change a thing except the baking time.  I have a bit of a fast oven, so I decreased the temp to 340 degrees and it was actually done after 40 minutes. To make things easier in terms of chopping walnuts and cranberries, I used my food processor (just pulsed until they were chopped into a good size).

I added an additional half cup chopped walnuts and an additional 1/4cup orange juice. This recipe turned out excellent! Exactly the right moistness and taste of cranberry and orange is balanced.

Made 2 loaves; used a heaping cup of dried cranberries; left out the walnuts...absolutely delicious! Will be making this for gift giving! Next time I will probably make it with Gluten-Free Flour, will review it again at that time.

Very Tasty! I used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar. 1-1/2 C. whole cranberries and pecans instead of walnuts (preference). Put into 2 small loaf pans then drizzled an orange icing over both when cooled. Super moist, great recipe!

Received this bread for Christmas. It was a dark, moist bread.  Thought I would find the recipe. Found the above photo (dark rich).  Followed the directions completely, but my bread was not the dark rich color pictured in the photo.  Not what I expected, would like to find a darker bread recipe.

Perfect for Christmas morning! This is a great, super easy recipe. I used about 3 times as many cranberries as the recipe called for,  and I left them whole, except for a handful that I halved and used to decorate the top of the loaf. I also used about 2 1/2 times as many walnuts. And I sprinkled half a tablespoon of sugar over the top of the loaf as well. The resulting bread was scrumptious.

A great quick and easy bread and "starter" recipe for the novice. Very tasty. I have added variety to this basic recipe by adding in  other dried fruit like dates, plums, cherry, etc. You are only limited by your imagination.

Other than the cranberries, there wasn't much flavor. It was ok but I won't make it again.

I put a bit more zest to bring out the orange. My oven is getting older and doesn't distribute the  heat very well...so the bottom was a bit more done. However, one thing that I do...while you bread is hot....put butter or margarine on top....get it nice and moist....then put a coating of sugar on top. I started doing this years ago with my banana bread and its a small touch that makes it all my own!

I don't bake very often but I did make this bread and it was excellent.  My husband doesn't  normally care for cranberries but he loved this bread.  It was moist and looked very festive.  I plan to make some mini-loaves to add to Christmas baskets.  Not sure how long to bake the mini-loaves.  The full size took 50 minutes so maybe 25 minutes?

Fruit flavors were strong and slightly tart, which is good, but not much richness or depth.  The consistency was a bit dense and firm and the top was glossy and hard. It was very light in color, not brown and moist.

I made a batch and divided it into 3 small loaf pans so I could try it without nuts, with walnuts, and with pecans--all of which were yummy. I love the orange flavor with the cranberries. My personal favorite is with pecans. I will definitely make it again.

Had to share... Tried it yesterday and it is delicious and moist..... and SO quick and easy!
I chopped up the cranberries and the walnuts, measured out the dry ingredients, cracked my egg... then realized I had no orange juice...SO I used apple juice and a 1/4 tsp orange extract!!
Will definitely make it again.

Excellent, basic and simple recipe that I make every Thanksgiving.  I make with and without chocolate chips and the loaf with the chips always disappears before the standard one.  Use whatever size or type of chip you like depending on your love of chocolate.  Enjoy!

Love this recipe.  The only change I made was to add 1 more cup of chopped cranberries, as others had suggested.  I divided the batter into 2 slightly smaller loaves and baked for 40-42 minutes.  The results were great so I will make it again for Thanksgiving this year, 2015.

Like some other reviewers, I found this bread to be quite dry.  The flavor is nice (especially the cranberry) but mine did not turn out moist at all.  It almost seems as though it may be over-baked, though I only baked it for 43 minutes in a slightly less than 350 degree oven. I wonder if there is too little oil.  If I make it again, I will try adding some applesauce.

Beat recipe ever.  It is not overly sweet.  Added 50% more nuts and cranberries.  I doubled the recipe. (Don't double the salt ! Only half again as much)  This was very moist.  Not dry at all!  Do not over mix. Just fold ingredients together till the dry is just moistened. It is not dark brown when done. Only golden.  50 minutes in my convection oven.  Don't skip the zest.  It is really good. 
Awesome recipe!!!

This is a wonderful bread. I used lightly toasted pecans instead of walnuts and very coarsely chopped the cranberries. I like it because I don't have to drag out the mixer -- can all be done by hand.  The bread is not overly sweet, but still has enough sweetness to be satisfying. Great breakfast bread!

This is a good recipe. I think that when you get a bite that doesn't have cranberry though, the bread isn't very flavorful by itself. I recommend putting in  some ground cinnamon, cloves, and allspice to make it more interesting.

I love this bread, we have it at the hospital. I split the flour to 1 C all purpose and 1 C whole wheat. omitted oil and replaced it with one small ripe banana. (if you don't have a ripe banana, you can roast and cool a fresh one). Instead of the white sugar, I used brown (helps with moisture too) and added cinnamon and allspice (my preference), Juice and zest of 2 oranges, as I love the orange taste more equally with the walnuts and cranberries, instead of a 'hint' of orange. Overall great basic recipe, it's like lasagna or meatloaf, you can add or leave out what you like, just keep the balance of wet and dry ingredients, baking is more fickle when it comes to dry/wet ingredients. Thanks for Sharing!

I didn't have fresh cranberries, so I used dried ones. The bread is moist and remarkably orange flavored even without adding orange zest. I'm going to try it again using fresh cranberries and I'll bet it will be a 5 star with the extra tartness.

I made this bread today, a double batch, and it was SO GOOD! Things to note that I did:  I cut the fresh cranberries into halves. I didn't have orange juice so I squeezed the juice from one orange (yielded approx. 1/4 cup) and then used 1 more egg, and 1 cup of applesauce to offset the missing liquid. The batter was VERY THICK, and it came out perfect.

Great recipe. I did add a cinnamon crumble topping which just made it better, but I bet it would be great with some orange donut glaze drizzled on it.

This is a very good recipe. Easy and fast, 2 of my favorites.  I did use a whole bag of cranberries because I didn't want to save them. I used coconut oil for the oil and added some cinnamon & nutmeg only because I love spices in everything. I didn't have any orange juice so I used a pear cinnamon cider that I had on hand. It was very moist with a great flavor.

Karin you hit it out of the park with this one.  The first time I made it only change I made was to leave out the nuts because of a food allergy.  Everyone loved it!  Simply out of personal taste, the other changes were to increase the OJ to 1 cup and the cranberries to about a cup and 1/2.  

I made it for Thanksgiving this year along with my mothers cran/nut and my entire family liked it better.  Sorry mom.

Loved this and it wasn't too sicky sweet which I prefer. I made it vegan by substituting Energ-G egg replacer for the egg and it came out great.  Other adjustments I made: used whole wheat pastry flour vs white, cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, eliminated the orange zest (didn't have any), increased OJ to 1 cup and prepared this as muffins. Sprinkled the top with more chopped walnuts and next time I'll also add some cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top like some other reviewers raved about.  Baked up 12 muffins in 30 mins at 350 F. Much better once the muffins completely cool and the ingredients settle in together.

Easy and half the sugar of most recipes which is important to me. I always use whole berries and at times have thrown in blueberries too. Make it almost every week during cranberry season. Love it!!

Wow very delicious nut bread. I used the nuts I had on hand. Almonds and pecans. Be generous with the cranberries. I used fresh ones. I will be making this again. Oh, I also used half whole wheat flour.

Very moist and flavorful.  I used about 1 1/2 cup of cranberries - small berries were kept whole and larger berries were cut in half.   This bread is good with a glaze topping, crumb topping and with no topping at all.  You can easily alter this recipe to your taste.  Looking foward to trying this with almonds soon.

Even with an extra teaspoon of oil, this bread was crumbly and on the dry side.  Followed directions very carefully and did not over mix.  Pulled out of oven early, too, since it was done ahead of baking time.  Also didn't care for the orange flavor -- it was bitter and I used zest rather than peel.  Guess this flavor combination isn't for me.  Served it with whipped cream cheese and that helped.

I never baked with fresh cranberries before, and I was surprised at how tough the berries are.  But when sliced and baked they were delicious!  The best thing I liked about this recipe is that it was simple to follow and didn't use too many ingredients.  I will make this again!

Really good. I did dark chocolate chips instead of walnuts. Next time I would add an extra 1/4-1/2 cup of berries. Also I stole someone else's suggestion of lining the greased pan with cinnamon and sugar to make it a crispier crust. Then add some with sugar in the raw on top before baking.

For a more decorative look had press some berries and chocolate on top before putting it in the oven.

This is my first time making cranberry bread, and I read the reviews before trying it myself. I noted that several people said this recipe made the bread very dry, so I added 1/3 cup of sour cream to the mix as well as a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 tsp nutmeg for flavor. I reduced the cranberries to 1 cup and increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also sliced and smashed the cranberries before adding them. I must agree that it is much better after it has cooled. If you try it when it's warm, the cranberries do over power the flavor of the bread. We chilled it before eating it, and it turned out absolutely wonderful! My husband and my son both love it, so I will definitely be making this for our Thanksgiving family get-together. 
The only thing I would do differently next time is add some melted butter to the top of the loaf while it's baking because the crust did come out pretty hard, which I usually like, but it was a little tough to bite into the corners. Otherwise, I'm really glad I found this recipe!

Yum! I'm eating this right now, fresh out of the oven. I omitted nuts, and used lemon zest in place of the orange zest which made the bread tarter, and it could have benefited from a little bit more sugar in the dough. I used about 1/4-1/3 C whole wheat flour out of the 2 C of prescribed flour. Overall, a keeper and so delicious.

Amazing!!
I used 1 1/2 cups of cranberries and 2/3 cups of walnut and 1 cup of sugar (because I was worried about tartness due to extra cranberries). Kept the rest same. I chopped the cranberries and walnuts in the food processor. They were fairly finely chopped. 
Will be making it again soon!

Very good. I decreased the sugar to 2/3 c, added toasted almonds instead of walnuts, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and used the zest of a lemon instead of the orange. Turned out amazing!

Used most of a bag of cranberries.  I chopped 1/2 cup and put the rest in whole.  Next time I'll just throw them all in whole.  I used sliced almonds because that is what I had on hand and I really liked the flavor combination.  By far the prettiest bread I have ever made!

Delicious and Yummy :) I made this for Thanksgiving Breakfast and sliced it and put cream cheese on it .. YUMMY. I used the base of the recipe I only added more Walnuts since I love a lot of nuts ... I sliced the cranberries in half but before I put the bread in the oven I placed Whole Berries and brown sugar on the top - Looked BEAUTIFUL. I did have to cook these for about 60 min. Thank You for a Great recipe

I made this recipe this morning for our New Year's breakfast. I used fresh squeezed OJ and cranberry, and also an OJ glaze.  The favor was good, not too sweet, but it didn't knock my socks off. I think I'd either add an additional egg to increase the moisture content.

Thank you so much for this recipe! It's a great alternative to regular cranberry sauce no one touched last year. This was the first time I baked it, on Thanksgiving day no less, and it didn't flop. Very big hit esp when right out of the oven. Very moist and yummy were the comments I got back. Will definitely make again!

This is the second year in a row that I have made this bread and once again, I had to make a second batch.  I just can't keep it around.  It is so good and moist too!  I do increase walnuts to 1 cup and add decorative red sugar on top before baking.  It comes out lovely every single time.

Finally!  a very good way to use my fresh cranberries in a bread form.  We all loved this bread recipe.  Very moist and yummy.

This bread is awesome! I made about 2 dozen loaves to pass out at Christmas. It was a hit! Everyone loved it and wanted more.
I used 1 1/4 c flour and 3/4 c whole wheat flour, added an extra 1/4 c cranberries and omitted one tablespoon oil.

This recipe was delicious and very tangy with the orange flavoring. I just had to watch it sooner than 50 mins. Mine was done in about 40 so it was a little dry on the ends but--yum! Thanks!

I want to say I did something wrong. It came out dry, heavy, and not sweet enough. I will have to try again. Only one other person said this about this loaf.
