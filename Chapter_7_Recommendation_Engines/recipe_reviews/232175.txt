Just a couple of thoughts on this recipe - peeling and cooking the potatoes then slicing and frying leads to more of a mashed potato than sliced.  Leftover chilled potatoes would probably work better.   Hubby loved this covered in ketchup.  Bell peppers would be a good addition with the onions.

This is a great potato recipe. I would add more eggs next time as well as either bacon or sausage bits to give it a more complete meal feel. Although filling, it felt more like a side. Feeds three adults at my house with the original recipe.
