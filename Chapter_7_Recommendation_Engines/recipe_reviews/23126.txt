This was so good I almost ate half of it before dinner was even served.  Don't be fooled by its simplicity, and don't leave out the fennel seed, as it really complements the flavour of the black-eyed peas and the spinach.  I only had whole fennel seeds so I used those.  The only change I would make is to cook the whole dish over the stove as I don't see the point of transferring it to another dish just to finish it in the oven.

This is very good, but I used a 14.5 oz can of tomatoes instead and added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to give it more flavor.  I brought it to Thanksgiving dinner and my uncle kept going on and on about how much he loved it; he ate more of this than anything else, even the turkey!  It travels really well and looks very pretty and colorful.  The red and green might be fun at a Christmas dinner!  BTW, I used frozen spinach, thawed and drained, and it was still very good.

I cooked my beans in a crock pot for a few hours, ground the fennel seed in my Bullet...  the fennel gave this meal just the right flavor.  I loved this healthy meal and will definitely make it again and again.

Loved the combination of ingredients. I used a "family size" bag of fresh spinach, added two minced cloves of garlic, basil, oregano and pinch of cayenne. I sprinkled fresh shredded parmesan of top before baking.

Our family really enjoyed this recipe -- including our 6 year old daughter.  I might cut the salt back just a little bit.  I also didn't have the fennel seed (and am not a big fan of it) so I just used an equal amount of Herbes de Provence.  It was a really hit and we'll be cooking it again!

Very tasty. Since I didn't have a pressure cooker, nor time to soak and cook dried black-eyed peas, I used canned organic black-eyed peas.  And here's a happy accident: I mistakenly used too much salt, so to counteract it, I added some cooked macaroni to the finished dish. Nice addition.  By the way, the baking step at the end may not be crucial, but your call.

Oh wow, this is scrumptious and hearty. I read other reviews and made minor changes: 14.5 oz can of tomatoes instead of the larger one, used half the salt, and added a clove of pressed garlic and a bit of cayenne pepper. I had whole fennel seeds on hand so I did my best to chop them a bit with a knife. it turned out awesome. I think I'm going to explode from eating too much of this! :)

Quite delicious, and healthy. My dad loved it and raved about it.  I added about 1/4 cup of Jicama, which helped soak up the flavors; used a 14.5 oz can of garlic and herb tomatoes, plus about 6 cherry tomatoes I had lying around, and threw in a tomatillo I had left over, all which added a wonderful sweetness.

I made this last night for dinner, and really enjoyed it.  Met our high fiber needs along with our vegetarian son's needs.  The only difference was I used canned black beans and crumbled some day old corn bread over the top. Yum.

This dish really surprised me.  I've never used fennel before, but went ahead and got some and tried it.  I think the very subtle/mild licorice sort of flavour really made this dish.  I'm not really a big licorice fan, but the flavour is mild and enhances the rest of the flavours to give that little something different.  I might just make this for the office potluck this week... the red & green colours go with the festive season! :)

This was truly an original.  It is a great way to eat good-for-you foods.  I modified it a bit by adding ground veal with spices at the bottom of the casserole dish and putting a few tablespoons of heavy cream in the spinach (I kept the veal, spinach and beans separate simulating a shepard's pie).  It was very tasty and was a complete meal with some garlic bread on the side. Enjoy!

Not a bad dish, both my husband and I liked it, but not good enough to save the leftovers.  Also, my girls (3 & 5) did not care for it at all, so it is probably not a dish I would make again.  I thought the fennel seed was a little overpowering, so I wish I would've gone with my initial instincts and just added some basil and oregano instead.  I think that the fennel was the main turnoff for my kids, as well.  If I ever do make this again, I will switch out the herbs and serve it as a side dish rather than a main dish.

Yum Yum Yum!!! This was very tasty. My 3 year old, 1 year old and husband all loved it. I think it would be good served with some barley, rice or a crusty bread. Will be making again!

My picky family ate every bit of this. I changed the recipe to meet what I had in the kitchen that day. I used Italian seasoning instead of fennel. I used frozen black eyed peas and frozen spinah, and frozen chopped onion. I just cooked the frozen black eyed peas as it says on the package. I added double the diced tomatoes. The colors were beautiful. It goes great with sausage cornbread!

Surprisingly good for something so simple! Fennel seemed like an odd choice, but somehow it just works--I'd advise against subbing other seasonings in its place, at least on the first go round. I followed the advice of others and used canned, not fresh, black-eyed peas and just a 14.5-oz can of tomatoes. I also used whole unground fennel seeds, two bags of spinach (~4-5 cups), only 1 1/2 ts of salt, and a liberal sprinkling of black pepper, and I let it cook down on the stove rather than transferring to the oven. I thought this recipe would be underwhelming, but it's really excellent--will definitely be making this again!

Turned out great. Family loved it. I did not have a pressure cooker so I used 2 cans of black eyed peas and drained and rinsed them. Used 1 tsp salt instead of 2.

Amazingly delicious!!  As a southern girl, I wanted to elevate the traditional New Year's Eve black eye pea  dish.  This is definitely met that markt and I will be making it throughout the year  too!  I don't like the taste of fennel.  As a substitute I sautéed the onion in basil infused olive oil, then added the tomatoes (drained - reserving the juice), spinach, salt and  oregano.  I added the juice to the casserole as needed to add moistness.  I served it over Sweet Jalapeno Cornbread.   I strongly advise cooking  the peas in the pressure cooker.  They came out with a firm but tender texture.  And the spinach, tomatoes, and onion added the right amount of zing and pizazz.  This dish is a real winner!!

This was surprisingly delicious! Looking at the ingredients I figured it would be bland but wanted to give it a shot anyways. Great festive dish for Christmas but it's so good  I will start rotating this dish in for our regular weeknight meals too!

Delicious!! I love this stuff!! My husband did too. I had made a double batch and I'm glad because our son stopped by and had 3 helpings! We will definitely be having this one again.
I had to substitute the fennel... researched the best substitutes for fennel and closest match with very similar taste was anise. I didn't have anise seeds and with a little more research, I found that anise extract could be used but at a .6 to 1 tsp ratio. That was the only deviation that I made and it worked. Smelled delicious while cooking too.

This is super. I doubled the recipe - two 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes, one can of black-eyed peas and I used almost two full bags (10oz each) of fresh spinach due to spinach's magnificent shrinking act. One onion is plenty when doubling. I also only had fennel seed and didn't have the patience to grind it. After saute-ing all of it, I drained out some of the liquid and baked it as directed. My 19 month old kept asking for more and I had to pull the fork from my husband to save it for the guests!

Interesting blend of flavours! We enjoyed the mild fennel flavour. I made this meal entirely in a large saucepan and used fresh tomatoes from the garden. Quick, easy and tasty.  This recipe is a keeper. Thanks!

Very Good! I added 2 cloves of garlic and only used 1 tsp of salt. My family loved this recipe for our meatless Monday!

this need more flavor, but i'm not sure what.  i also ruined it by putting a non-quality cheddar cheese on top while it baked in the oven.  the next day's leftovers were better, but it still needed something.

A hearty, tasty meal that my family enjoyed. I used a mix of beans too. Next time I want to try adding mushrooms!

This was OK, but much better once I reheated with some curry flavouring
