This recipes was so simple and delicious!  This was my first time roasting a pork loin, and I was very afraid it would turn out dry.  It was so moist!  My husband and my toddler both loved it.  I did improvise a little bit.  We don't like rosemary, so I didn't use it.  I also did not have dijon mustard, so I used 2 Tbsp powdered mustard and 1 Tbsp of hot sweet mustard and it turned out great.  I had originally thought that the applesauce would slide off of the roast, but it actually stayed on very well, which is why I think it was so moist.  This is definitely one of those rare recipes that I will print out and put into my recipe binder.  Oh, and it tastes great with a little bit cranberry sauce too!  Yum!

This is honestly the BEST pork loin recipe I have tried, and believe me, I've tried a lot! I used homemade applesauce, and it was amazing! Not only was the pork extremely tender, but it also had great flavor. Others mentioned that their applesauce burnt from the cooking time, but mine came out a beautiful golden color. I would absolutely recommend this recipe, and plan to make this for the next family dinner that we are having! This is the only pork loin recipe I am using from now on!

This recipe was simple yet delicous.  I didn't have applesauce so I substituted applebutter omitting the honey from the recipe.  The fresh rosemary smelled devine as it was cooking.  Once the roast was done, I threw away the sprigs of rosemary and thinly sliced the roast.  My whole family (who really aren't big pork fans) gave it the thumbs up.  I would't hesistate to go with the applebutter in the future, in fact since it did turn out so well,  I will skip the applesauce and honey and stick with that.

Nummy!! My first pork roast in the oven, as I usually cook them in the slow cooker. I tripled the sauce and coated the pork with it. I didnt have any fresh rosemary so I used dried and it tasted great! I also left out the salt and pepper. This was a super tender roast that everyone raved about. Everyone also made pork sandwiches with the left overs the next day and couldnt get enough. Going to make this again this coming weekend for more company!

This was so easy to make.  I added baby carrots all around the roast.  The applesauce mixture made them taste so sweet!  Even my two year old loved them.  My husband and I didn't care for the rosemary on the top so I will exclude it next time.  I will make this recipe on a regular basis.

YUMMY! I only had the individual servings of applesauce with cinnamon in it on hand. This turned out totally delicious!

I followed the recipe for the sauce and made it for porkchops (so I altered the amounts a bit)  It was tasty, something different and one I would consider basic, as it used ingrediants I already had open in my fridge.

This was very moist, tender, and flavorful. I did not have honey. I also omitted the herb. I used regular mustard, as I didn't have Dijon,and it was excellent.

This is so gross! The sauce was just a blob on the pork, it didnt cook into a 'sauce' or carmalize as others had happen. It was a nasty puke color, and just plain bad. I will not make again!

Needing something healthy and quick for dinner, this worked out very well. I scaled it down using just one pork tenderloin as there are only two of us and that was the perfect amount. I didn't sear it in oil, just used Pam, and used a bit of cinnamon in the sauce. I didn't have any fresh rosemary so I just used crushed but it still tasted great. I poured about a cup of apple cider into the baking dish before placing the tenderloin in and then covered with the sauce. It came out moist and the sauce thickened to the tenderloin perfectly. Thank you for this recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

This was too easy to taste this good! All I had was THICK cut pork chops, so (after seasoning and browning as directed) I just put 3 of those in the oven with the sauce mix for about 50 minutes, until internal temp was 155, then covered with foil and let them rest 10 minutes before serving. They were fantastic! Reheated well as leftovers, too. I'll make this again and again!

Found the meat to be rather bland.  Mostly tasted like applesauce on top of pork.  The meat needs to be seasoned prior to topping with the applesauce mixture.  I think I would add onion & garlic. I gave it 3 stars because the meat was really tender, but I don't think I would use this recipe again without adding to it.

I am with the others... i usually  either grill or slow cook my pork. I cooked the way they said but instead of cooking it in my HUGE roasting pan. I wrapped mine in foil and set in a glass pan. My take on it .. Well it makes it more moist and prevents alot of the juices and goodness from browning on the bottom of the pan. Although surely not the low fat way to do things..lol if you prefer you sauce more colored i would say unwrap it for the last hour at most. Might really help with people saying there meat was dry. Cause this is amazing.

Very good.  Applesauce (home made), mustard and honey compliment the pork nicely.  Next time will slice open roast and add a layer of sauce mix and rosemary inside, then tie closed before cooking. Used a 1.5lb roast and it took 1.5 to 2 hrs to cook.

Made exactly as stated with a 3lb pork loin. As many others stated the outside of the roast is very flavorful but the inside was not. Need a way to get this sauce into the middle of the loin so that should give you some ideas. I brined my pork loin for 4 hours before cooking and that helped with the moisture.

Not sure what I did wrong, but my pork was really dry (and I monitored the internal temp).  I also didn't really care for the sauce/glaze since I tasted mostly applesauce.

fabulously tender and moist - can't believe how great it turned out! I usually cover my roasts, and they still get dry. This is PERFECT.

This was super easy!  I threw mine in my slow cooker and let it simmer all day.   This took out any chance of it being dry (and it made my house smell fantastic!)  I took another reviewer's advice and used the apple butter while omitting the honey.  I also used dried rosemary instead of fresh.   I will certainly make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe that tastes like it took a lot more work than it actually does!

I made this with pork chops in a skillet and I didn't have the rosemary but it still tasted good.  I served it with egg noodles that I mixed some cream cheese into.  The noodles which were plain tasting went well with the applesauce & pork flavor.

Very moist.  It needed no sauce and was tender and skightkly fruitfu flavor.  Browning the loin is is of utmost importanance .  I actually chopped and cooked fresh apples rather than use canned apple sauese.  Served with slamm roasted potatoesl, green beens, garlic, red peppers.n

This was so good!  I use allrecipes all the time and I never remember to review things, but I wanted to make a point to for this one.  It was so easy to make and it came out amazing, my husband and I both loved it.  The only change I made was to double the sauce, I'm not sure if it even made a difference but the sauce was delicious and the pork came out so moist.  I will definitely be making this again.  I'm going to use my panini press to make cuban sandwiches with the leftovers.

The one and only time my oven roasted pork loin was actually tender and moist! I have always used a crock pot for that very reason, but last night I took a chance and wasn't disappointed. I did make a few tiny changes: I deglazed the searing pan with a 1/4 cup white wine, lightly reduced that, and added the liquid to my roasting dish, added a 1/2 tsp. ginger paste, garlic paste, 1/4 tsp sage, finely chopped just the rosemary nettles, and mixed all that into the applesauce (and used homemade cinnamon b/c that's what was open in the fridge) and it was great! You really couldn't taste the cinnamon in the roast directly, but it could have mellowed the flavor, and I do think searing the roast is a crucial step to sealing in the juices!

My first pork loin roast was a success (for the most part)!  Here are the things I did differently . . . 1. Doubled the sauce b/c I used two 1.5 lb pork roasts.  2. Only used 3 sprigs of rosemary and the flavor still dominated the roast.  3. Used a roasting pan with a lid and I don't know if I would do that again.  I was afraid the roast would be dry but I think the cover stopped the sauce from turning into a glaze.  Not going to lie, it looked kind of gross when it was done.  It still tasted good though!!

This was simple to prepare and was outstanding.  People were referring to the applesauce mixture as a sauce - I considered it more of a coating and it created this heavenly crust on the outside of the roast.  This had so much flavor and the prep work was so fast and easy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Vikki.

I've always been hesitant to try a roast for fear it'd be too complicated. I am no longer afraid-cuz this was super easy-and delicious! I added just a splash of cider vinegar and an 1/8 tsp. of cinnamon.

This recipe did not turn out as well as I had hoped.  The sauce blackened after about an hour from the cooking temperature, and the pork loin still had another hour to go!  Flavor wasn't anything special either.  It was easy, and my boyfriend said he liked it, but I will not be making this again.  Maybe add the applesauce mixture later, or cook at a slightly lower temperature?

This was very good. I used the applebutter and tarragon because I did not have applesauce or rosemary. The only issue I had with this was it did not turn out as tender as I wanted it to be. Next time I will try the crockpot. I will use this recipe again.

Good flavor except I somewhat agree with one reviewer who questioned the cosmetics of the dish.  I left my applesauce in big chunks, added some slices of onion on top of the roast before smearing it with the apple mix.  The juices it created were very tasty and would make a nice gravy if thickened slightly.  Maybe use pink applesauce or tinit with a little red food coloring to give it a more appetizing appearance?

Made this today and we loved it! I increased applesauce to entire can, doubled the dijon & prescribed amt of honey...put the fresh rosemary on top to bake.
This is a good recipe, tasty & simple to make...Thanks for sharing it!

Got a last minute call to prepare pork loin for 35 people.  Found this recipe which looked easy and prayed for the best.  It was FANTASTIC!  I got rave reviews from everyone.  We used chunky apple sauce to give more texture to the meal.  For those who found this to not be flavorful, it may depend on the apple sauce you use.  Some watery kinds just don't have the flavor you'd need to make this as good as it could be.  We started with a high quality cut of meat, used fresh rosemary and had had no complaints at all - except for those people who wanted MORE!

4.5 stars. Very easy and quite tasty. Made 1 1/2 amount of glaze which covered the roast well. Stays moist but remember to brown well before covering. Will make again.

We had this for supper tonight and have to say it is really flavourful and moist.  Super good.  Made a couple of changes... left out salt and ground about a teaspoon of rosemary and mixed with the apple sauce and Dijon etc before covering the roast with the mixture.  Definitely will make again.

Awesome!  Subbed a few sprinkles of cinnamon for the rosemary and e.v.o.o. for the veg oil.  SO delicious and easy.  My three year old took seconds for the first time in a year!  Served with caramelized red onions and potato hash.

I made 4-1punder loins in a cast iron pan and it was delicious. I used doubled to tripled the oil, onions and garlic because i like it. I also had it a little to long in the oven so it was dry. I also had no applesauce but i could not stop tasting the meat with the sauce that was in the pan. My husband like it also allot. Thank you for publishing this.

This was excellent as written, except for a tad too much dijon for my taste. I will reduce to 2 tablespoons next time. The only change I made was adding a diced apple to the applesauce mixture. I also mixed the rosemary into the applesauce, otherwise it would have sat on top and dried out. I think I will used sage next time.

Makes a great moist and flavorful pork roast.  I used chunky applesauce and a stone ground mustard-increased the quantities of both by 1/3. I used fresh rosemary which gave a wonderful aroma to the kitchen while it was cooking.  This one's a keeper!

This was good. It's not the crispy outside/juicy inside tenderloin I am used to. It wasn't anything wonderful, but it was okay. Not sure if I will make again.

This recipe was great with one extra special ingredient...so the applesauce mix I added Chipotle-style Tabasco sauce and it gave the meat a much-needed kick, without which I'm afraid it would have been too bland.  I omitted the rosemary, as other reviewers suggested, and instead made rosemary potatoes as a side.  Perfect and can't wait to make again!

Very good. I did not have any mustard, but decided to add some liquid smoke to the applesauce mixture - it turned out great! Will make again.

Everyone loved it.  It was moist.  I didn't use the rosemary sprigs because I thought my kids (ages 6 & 9) wouldn't like it.  My youngest did notice the pepper - I will use less next time.

This is a great recipe for a pork loin!  I used Sarah's Applesauce recipe, which is awesome.  In the past I've had bad results baking pork loin always ending up with dry icky pork so I normally cook it on the grill, but since it's snowy I was forced to search for an oven method.  I did use a roasting bag, just to be safe (and easy cleanup!) and the pork was so moist and delicious.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried and added some dried thyme as well.  Served with extra applesauce on the side and homemade stuffing with figs and apricots and it was a perfect savory/sweet dinner for a snowy winter night!

This was extremely easy to prepare and tasted fabulous!  Even my 20 year old nephew told his mom that it was the best pork roast he had ever eaten!  I did, however, leave out the rosemary and I only had chipotle mustard.  I will definitely make this again!

This was very moist. I had a 41/2lb Tenderloin so I increased the other ingredients proportionaly. I did add garlic powder, Sage and some basil to flavor it up a bit. Also I substituted French's Horseradish Mustard and a dash of white cooking wine for the Dijon Mustard. There were no leftovers.

Delicious! The juices at 160 degrees were still pretty red though so I cooked it longer until it was about 180 degrees. Definitely something healthy Ill make again!

Thank you for this delicious recipe. I made this a couple of weeks ago and my entire family liked it so well, that I've got a double batch in the oven right now for Easter dinner. FIVE ***** STARS!

Since I, too, had apple butter on hand, I followed SLIMPICKINGS advice, using it and omitting the honey.  The roast turned out to be fabulous!  Juicy and with delicious flavor.  I'll definitely be repeating this one again.

I don't know what the person did to this recipe to call it "gross" but this recipe was excellent. I poked some holes in my roast and spooned the sauce in them and the flavor was all thru the roast. I also kept adding the sauce throughout the cooking. That was last week and I'm making it again today. Delicious!!

this came out excellent, everyone in my family could not get enough of how juicy the pork was and they loved the flavor of the sauce. the only thing i did differently was i used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon and omitted the rosemary as i did not have any. it came out great!

This was a delicious pork loin.  I marinated the meat over night to add extra flavor and added a tiny bit of ginger, which I think both added a lot to the recipe.  It is very good for how few ingredients it calls for.  Mine did cook up quite a bit faster, probably about 50 minutes and the sauce around the pork burned, but not the sauce on the pork.  Great recipe overall!

This recipe is wonderful.  Very simple, wonderful presentation that makes it look far more complicated than it is.  I do suggest adding some chopped apple pieces (if you aren't going to make your own applesauce, which I will do next time) and cinnamon.  I also added some brown sugar, based on a dish I had at a restaurant.  The brown sugar added a perfect amount of sweetness without makign it too sugary or syrupy.  I'm not a creative chef, so if I can alter it and it comes out well, its got to be a great recipe to start with. I made it for my boyfriend's family, and they loved it.

This was great!  I did not bake it, but we put it on the grill.  I should have let it marinade for a lot longer (I did for 1 hr)  The little bit of taste that did manage to seep in was excellent.  I would never of put these ingredients together, but it was good.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was ok, but nothing impressive. The pork did come out moist, but thought it was a bit flavorless. Maybe try it again with the applebutter.

This is a great recipe for pork. I used it on 2 tenderloins. I am usually not a huge fan of fruit & meat, but it sounded like something my children would enjoy. As far as some reviewers saying there wasn't much flavor, try adding some more seasoning to the pork before adding the applesauce mixture. This recipe as written is more mild, but you can always add to it. It was terrific. We all love it and it was incredibly tender. Thanks!

I followed this recipe almost exactly except had to use regular mustard. It was moist but completely flavorless. I will never make this again. 2 stars instead of 1 only because it was moist.

GREAT RECIPE! I used  pork tenderloin (500g) 1/2 applesauce and 1 tablespoon of dijon honey mustard. I loved the rosemary on top! Very moist and tasty. I cook to 170F.

This was a great dish (and I am not a huge pork fan) but I couldn't cook it as long as recommended or it would have been dried out so be sure to watch it in case your oven cooks too fast!

This was a super easy and yummy dish. I'll definately make it again but without the rosemary.
