Okay, so I just bought a herb arrangement from the local high school horticulture sale. I don't want to wait for blossoms, so I used some stems. Delicious!  Lavender latte like the fancy coffee shops!  Used about 10" of snips from the plant in place of blossoms.

I found it to be extremely weak, I normally boil my simple syrup down to be somewhat on the thicker side, maybe not enough lavender buds, I don't know?

Really easy gift to make or to keep a bottle of it at home. I used it to make a vodka lemonade lavender martini, lavender prosecco, lavender whipped cream, lavender iced tea, and only waffles and pancakes. Fantastic!!

I made this plus added lavender oil. I also added food coloring to make it a purple color. Made this with my own lavender I grow. This makes a very yummy lavender ~lemon drop.

Went with half the sugar, changed nothing else, and itâ€™s a lightly sweet floral addition to cocktails and lattes!

This simple syrup is amazing!! I added at least double the amount of lavender because I was looking for strong lavender flavor. We put it in our coffee and make lavender lattes and mochas. A-mazing!!
