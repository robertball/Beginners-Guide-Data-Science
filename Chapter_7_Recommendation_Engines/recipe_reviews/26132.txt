Yummieee cookies ~ and the oats make them chewy.
 The only things I changed were the amount of sugar (and they were plenty sweet) I put about 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. And I used a stick plus 3 Tbsp. of butter instead of 2 sticks....Also used some dried cherries since I didn't have enough cranberries.
 *Lots of flavor ~ Love the orange in it*

great cookies!!   this is a recipe i would definately make again & recommend.. it really did make soft, chewy, flavorful cookies!! **PREPERATION:  i added extra orange zest, extract & cranberries... **BAKING:  baked on Pampered Chef stoneware on bottom shelf (this always produces soft chewy cookies i find..) for about 15 mins (it takes a bit longer to bake on stoneware)  **MODIFICATIONS:  next time i'm going to add white chocolate chips & use flavored cranberries...

Great cookies, very easy to make.  I used 1 tablespoonful of Cointreau (orange flavored liqueur) instead of orange extract, and orange-flavored dried cranberries.  Yummy!  Next time I'll use even more Cointreau.

I had recently tasted some wonderful cranberry-orange cookies and found this recipe shortly thereafter.  Unfortunately, they came out bad!  Maybe it was me but the came out "poofy" more like a bread instead of a cookie.  I will try it again - I'm not giving up!

I really enjoyed these cookies. They are a great way to trick the kids into eating oatmeal and cranberries! They had no clue until I told them. The orange flavor adds a great depth to the cookies. They were so moist and chewy. These cookies have made my permanent recipe list!

In place of cranberries, I put fresh, chopped apricots in the cookies and a little extra cinnamon. They are excellent! FYI: The batter is very sticky. My first batch of cookies were HUGE because I put heaping spoonfuls on the pan. You only need to use very small tablespoon-size spoonfuls and they turn out very moist and very good!

Just made a batch... Very good  Cranberry Orange Oatmeal Cookies. A little on the sweet side and could use a bit more cinnamon. Other than that wonderful recipe.

These are absolutely delicious...the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the butter can be cut to 1 1/2 sticks and the sugar could be cut a bit...I used fresh squeezed orange juice instead of orange extract because I didn't have any, and they're soooo good!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty. I substituted orange juice in place of the extract and soaked the cranberries in some orange juice before I added them; they were delicious.

This recipe saved me this holiday season!  I had one very similar that I make every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas. I lost it and went into a panic until I discovered this one!  I changed it a tiny bit to make it more like my original, adding 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, 3/4 chopped toasted pecans, and a little bit more cranberries. (I alos find parchment paper is the way to go.) They are excellent and taste just like the holidays to me!  So glad I found it. I will be making these every year!

Came out of the oven with a wonderful texture--chewy and soft, almost cake-like. Delicious cookies, but I'm only giving four stars because I had to double the amount of both orange zest and orange extract to get the orange flavor to stand out in the cookies.

The flavors meld together very well in this cookie.  The recipe yields a cookie that is soft and chewy in the center and a little crisp along the edge, which is just right.  The orange and the cranberries make this a perfect cookie for the fall months.

great flavor! i added ~1tbs orange juice instead of orange extract and used trader joe's orange-flavored cranberries. i also halved the butter and substituted applesauce 1:1. i did have a problem removing them from the nonstick cookie sheet on the first round- they stuck and crumbled. it was less of an issue on round 2 when i greased the sheet and added 1-2mins to the baking time. maybe would fare better without decreasing the fat. very yummy and great chewy texture. i will definitely try these again. maybe add some almonds!

These cookies are amazing.  The only thing I changed was instead of 1 cup butter, I did 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce.  They stay so moist and have half the fat!

I didn't have orange extract and I'm kind of glad I didn't - the peel was plenty of taste to make it subtle yet delicious - also I used instant oats and it worked fine

Fantastic chewy cookies!  My kid don't like them, but I think they're entirely wonderful.  I'd intended to glaze them, but they'd be too sweet if I did.  Next time may reduce the sugar a little if I want glaze on them.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

A perfect cookie-chewy-not too sweet-very satisfying.  Maybe not too easy on the waistline i.e butter content.  I stuck to the recipe exactly, and I got 3.5 dozen cookies, some were a tad larger. I would highly recommend parchment paper for these cookies.  They slide right off.

They turned out well - but nothing too special. The flavor was very good. Nice balance of cranberry & orange. Perfect with a cup of tea! Great winter cookie.

I made these this weekend.  I put less dried cranberries for my family's liking, and added some chocolate chips.  I didn't have orange extract, but squeezed a couple teaspoons of orange juice in.  These were wonderful and my family loved them!

Delivers the promised crunch and chewiness! Much more appealing than the traditional oatmeal raisin cookie. A classy classic.

These were okay, but I felt they were missing something.  If I make again, I would use more cranberries and less sugar - they were incredibly sweet!

My new favourite cookie! The dough was hard to mix near the end, it's very thick, but the cookies came out so dense and chewy, and really perfectly flavoured.  On the second batch I skipped the orange zest and just used maybe an extra half-tsp of orange extract, they were equally delicious. Definitely recommended for anyone who likes cranberries.  Was very well received by everyone.

Wow, these are good cookies! I added just a bit more cinnamon, and used orange juice in place of the extract, as that is what I had on hand, otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  These cookies are a nice change from your average oatmeal cookies.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe!

These are THE BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted.  I will never make plain oatmeal raisin cookies again.  I'll splurge on the dried cranberries and enjoy every bite.  If you haven't tried this recipe, you should. Thank you SO much for sharing!

I like these chewy oatmeal cookies. I did alter spice: 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also added 1 cup vanilla chips. I would make them again. Patrizia

I love these cookies! I increased the dried cranberries & orange flavoring for added punch. I also added just a little more flour for a fluffier cookie. Delicious. Thanks!

SOOOO TASTY!! These cookies are so warming and delicious everyone in my house loved them! Modifications to try: I took out half the sugar and half the butter to make them a little healthier and replaced 1 cup of oats with 1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds and 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds. I also added the juice from the orange instead of the orange flavoring and 1/4 tsp clove. The result was perfect!

Such an easy but yummy recipe!  I had to modify a few things thanks to a European kitchen. I replaced the baking soda with 16g (one package) of baking powder - worked fine. I didn't have any orange zest or extract so I substituted 5 tbsp (75 ml) of juice and added about 1/4 more oats - next time, I'll just leave it out. I used fresh cranberries with no problems whatsoever.   I also cooked them for about 14 min @ 180 degrees Celcius. This gave a fairly cakey effect, they probably could have gone for another minute or two, depending on personal preference and oven.   Very nice, I can't stop eating them!

I used half the sugar, a little less butter, more cranberries. The dough was very thick which had me a little worried. So I spooned small amounts of dough on the cookie sheet. They yielded about 45 cookies and tasted great.

The first time I made these they hardly spread, which was great. Today I made them again and they flattened into round cookies. They still taste the same but I am wondering which result is the expected one.

I made this last night and I was so excited about this recipe. The flavors were good, but the consistency was terrible.  I read other reviews and made sure my baking soda and eggs were fresh, but the cookies won't stay together.  I was going to take them to work, but they look terrible too. What a waste.

This is a great recipe.  I marinated the cranberries in orange juice and used the juice in place of the orange extract. I also used 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon of allspice (just because I love the way it makes desserts taste).  This will definately go into my recipe box.

I made these for the first time today & they were a hit.  My husband dislikes oatmeal cookies & doesn't care for cranberries, either.  But he liked these well enough to help himself to 3 of them.  I also found them to be tasty & a nice change from oatmeal raisin cookies.  The only modification I made was using 1T undiluted orange juice concentrate in place of the orange extract because that was all I had on hand.  I wouldn't recommend this, but it worked in a pinch.

My daughter has made these cookies 3 times for the County Fair and she has gotten a purple  all 3 times. She took it to the State Fair and also got a purple, every one that has tasted these cookies comments on the unique taste.  They are soft and chewy and easy to make.

This recipe was awesome. The orange and cranberry pairing is a nice combination. I bought the dried cranberries in the bulk section at Sprout's and they had a bit of orange flavor. Fantastic! My daughter and husband loved them! Note: I omitted the orange flavoring since the dried cranberries contained the flavor, but I still used the orange zest.

these were a hit with my co-workers.  such a nice change of pace from the usual oatmeal cookie.  I didn't measure the zest; just added all the zest from a large orange.  The only addition for me was dark about a cup of dark chocolate chips, as I thought the dark chocolate would compliment the orange nicely, and it did!  To keep these moist and chewy, I always add a slice of bread to my cookie tin, and it always works like a charm.  thanks for sharing this nice recipe.

Decent recipe! Easy! Only change I made was using real cranberries vs dried. I think the recipe would have been really dry had I not. They are very sweet cookies too. I would lessen sugar next time; especially if using dried cranberries.

Delicious! A happy 7-year old too (who doesn't like oatmeal at all)! I kept the recipe the same, but instead of using regular dried cranberries, I used cranberry-orange dried cranberries. I was worried the abundance of orange flavors would overpower the cookie, but it was just right! Will definitely make these again! Thanks for sharing a cookie recipe that isn't your traditional chocolate chip cookie... also very good... but different is always better in my house!

Easy and delicious cookie. My only change was using 1/2 cup self-rising flour because I ran out of all-purpose flour. It did not seem to make any difference. I will make these again.

My 4 yr old made these an they turned out great. Nice simple recipe. We changed the amount of butter to a half cup ( that was all the butter I had atm) an used  a duck egg instead of two chicken eggs.

These turned out really good.  I only gave 4 stars because they were a little too sweet for me. I used raspberry flavored cranberries that I got directly from a farm so maybe they were sweetened more than usual. Smelled amazing while baking.

These are delicious!  I substituted 1/2 cup margarine for half of the butter, used the zest from an entire orange (so maybe 1 1-2 Tbsps) and 1 Tbsp orange liqueur for the extract.  I refrigerated the dough overnight and baked on silicone mats in my baking sheets 10-11 minutes.

These turned out delicious!  I added orange extract and the orange flavored Craisins from Trader Joe’s… I also added a ton of walnuts! So yummy! I only used half of the brown sugar called for, and added extra cinnamon and ginger as well!  They were a little dry putting them on the sheet to cook but they do not come out dry after baked! And added extra cinnamon and ginger as well.  When the cookies bake they don’t spread out too much though… Are used a cookie scoop and if I didn’t press them down before I put them in the oven they remained the shape of a big ball....  I wanted something different to add to my Christmas baking list… Something delicious but not so sweet and these were perfect! No glaze or icing needed!

Oh my goodness!  Was looking for something different with on-hand ingredients.  This was a hit with the whole family.  In fact, my daughter (8) instantly requested them for her upcoming birthday party.  I wasn't sure about the orange, so I only made a 1/2 batch.  Next time, I'll be doubling the batch!
The only change I made was eliminating the orange extract, since I didn't have any and squeezing about 1/2 tsp orange juice in.

I substituted 1/2 cup of coconut flour for 1/2 c of all purpose. I also used a combo of rolled spelt and Kamut flakes instead of the oats. Since I didn’t have orange extract on hand, I substituted Triple Sec. I added 1/2 cup of chopped almonds.  They turned out chewy and delicious! The yield was 53 two inch cookies.

I made these exactly as written but they crumbled into pieces when I tried to remove them (after 2 minutes cooling on the sheet).  They are barely sweet enough for a cookie.  Everything I used was fresh.  I rolled them into a ball and placed them on the sheet, they spread fine-actually the outer 1/4" spread as thin as paper.  After they failed to hold together I went back to the recipe and noticed a lot of 5-star reviews included alterations and a few of the photos didn't appear to have oatmeal.  Maybe quick oats work better or 1/2 alternative to butter but this didn't work for me as written and that happens very rarely.

I made this and it is lovely! So yummy and my husband really loved it. He said it was not too sweet and the hint of orange is really nice. I added 1 cup of chopped almonds in place of 1 cup of oatmeal. It gives it a nice crunch! :)

I just left the orange out. I tried that with the dried cranberries, it was good but it isn't something I would eat regularly.  But the cookies were so yummy, even without the orange flavor, very mouth watery...thank you.

Just made these...they were fabulous! And I'm not an oatmeal cookie person! I did follow the suggestions and halfed the sugar. I also added a little extra orange zest, but I love citrus. The recipe was easy and the cookies were quick to make. I will definitely be making these again!

I made some changes , but I used the basics of this recipe. I omitted the vanilla and used the juice of half an orange. I also omitted the cinnamon. I used half butter and half shortening and I folded in a mixture of raisins and cranberry raisins. They were unbelievable! I hope people will try my variation to this recipe, they were crisp, chewy, and had a great orange flavor to complement  the cranberry and raisins in the recipe.

I've made this recipe several times now and have added it to my cookie gifts for Christmas.  I generally add some chopped walnuts to the mix.  My family and friends think these are terrific!  Just today my sister asked for this recipe.

Delicious cookies! I used dairy-free soy-free "butter" sticks, reduced the amount of sugar (to 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar), and I did not have any orange extract so I went without. Will definitely be making these again!!!

Just made these and I like them very much but the final product was a bit "flat" tasting.  I use sweet butter (no salt) for all my baking and there was no salt in the recipe.  I may try adding 1/2 tsp. of salt next time to see if that helps.

Great recipe I replaced the eggs and white sugar from the recipe with two bananas. Also didn't have any vanilla but the added banana have good flavor. This is a good way too make these if you have a kid that is allergic too egg.

I make this recipe every year at the holidays. We add a cup full of white chocolate chips to it and instead of orange extract, I add a 1/2 T more of orange zest. I like the flavor more that way. These are always a huge hit.

I actually made only one dozen to try it out. I used sultanas instead of cranberries. Skipped the brown sugar and added four tbsp of sugar and one tbsp of Mala's orange crush. I also used 100 g Nilgiri's vanilla yogurt instead of the egg. I had to change it to 1/2 c of flour and used 3/4 c of Britannia's classic oats, which are instant. I used only 1/4 tsp of dried zest that I made at home with sun-dried Nagpur orange peels. I think it came out well. It was soft and the flavor was perfect....but I had to change many things based on the availability of the ingredients.

Just made these and love them!  I used slightly less than 1 cup of butter because it was what I had and I used orange oil instead of extract (but used less b/c oil is very strong) & reduced sugar a little.  They are so tasty, will definitely make again.  I think the recipe is probably perfect as written I just made changes b/c of what I had on hand and I always try to reduce sugar wherever I can.

Good. Maybe I didn't add 1 T of orange zest because it wasn't very strong. Next time I would add more orange zest.

This is a great recipe to bounce some new ones off of. I made these cookies with close to half the sugar by using bakers sugar which is finer and 1/4 cup less brown sugar and added  to this recipe 1/4 tsp. salt about 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips & apporx 1/16 tsp. clove because dark chocolate, orange and cloves just scram warm cozy Christmas. If you feel adventurous try it this way. These are DELICIOUS!

I could not find the family recipe for these cookies, so I used this one instead and it is very close to what I had. This is a great, moist chewy cookie. 

I added a cup of cocoanut to the mix. I really like the added flavor and texture.
