Tastes amazing! We used regular Cool Whip and Zoe Greek Yogurt in Vanilla flavor - but it seems to me you could substitute any flavor of yogurt. Next time I might try a chocolate graham crust. Five stars!

I made this recipe and it was delicious! I used Greek yogurt because I couldn't find regular yogurt in plain lemon, but next time I'll use blueberry yogurt instead of lemon :-)

Very good.  Can be fairly healthy depending on type of yogurt and Cool Whip used.  Have made several of these with different flavors and they're all good!
