Using beef will add more flavor and for those who are not big eggplant fans...cut it in half. I also like big flavors so if you are not one of those people decrease the rosemary a bit. Glad so many like it. Thanks;) M

This turned out really fantastic! My just husband loved it. The only thing I changed was I omitted the leeks (because I forgot to buy them) used regular mushrooms instead of portabellos and doubled the sauce. Will make again.

Very good flavor the eggplant lends an interesting and unexpected deliciousness. Next time I make this I will use less cheese to make it a more calorie wise meal. Otherwise great!

Followed the directions to a tee. Pretty good but I think the italian seasoning overwhelmed the eggplant mushroom and chicken. Next time I'll use maybe a bit of fresh basil.

This recipe was WAY too much work to justify the end result. I followed this recipe exactly as instructed. The filling is delicious but the oven temperature is way too high and burned the cheese before it was done and though I added the parmesan about halfway through it burned as well. My oven temp has been checked and it is right on the money. It was an extremely dish and I will not make it again though I will use the ingredients again in another dish.

No radical changes. Locally fresh pasta sheets are unattainable so I opted to use cannelloni pasta tubes instead. I under-cooked the tubes from 8 to 6 minutes. The cheese gravy was good but very time consuming (but worth it). I donned some latex gloves to fill the tubes with the meat & veggie stuffing. The sauce was a little thicker than I anticipated and I spread and applied it while still wearing the latex gloves. The cooking time should say 45-60 minutes depending upon the oven and the browning that you desire. 50 minutes would have been about right. Delicious - salt & pepper to taste.

I used pre fab cannelloni which was more work than using fresh. For seasoning I left out the italian mix but used a lot of ground black pepper and sea salt. All and all a tasty dish would definately make it again.

I made this dish tonight for dinner and like other reviewers found it a bit bland. Good (but not rich or solid) flavor but...lacking something. I used ground beef and 1/2 the eggplant (was afraid my eggplant-phobic hubby would reject it and leave a massive casserole for me to eat solo. I also chose to cook up the mushrooms and eggplant a bit after the leeks were sauteed and wined. I also half browned the ground beef before wrapping in pasta to ensure food safety. Ended up baking for about 40 minutes. All in all I'm sitting on the fence with this one...it's a fair amount of work for a pretty good but not super dish...but my hubs did not notice the eggplant and enjoyed it:) so it may be a good dish for stealthy use of my garden abundance. I may or may not make it again.
