Thank you for sharing. This was awesome.  Instead of grilling; since we are in apartment, I baked the salmon for 25 min at 350 and it turned out wonderful.

AWESOME!  I will make this again and again!  Yumm!  And don't be afraid of the cayenne pepper it's certainly not too strong (my husband agreed and he doesn't care for really spicy things - I do though).  We cooked exactly by recipe and on a cedar plank on gas grill!  It was out of this world - one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had!

My husband and I love this recipe. Thank you so much.

It is a KEEPER!

Question: some have mentioned  plank salmon

cooking using a kitchen oven instead of outside grilling.

How do you preheat the plank and cook the salmon without 
having your home filled with SMOKE?

I made this recipe last night for the wife and I. The taste was excellent. My wife has declared it her favorite salmon recipe to date. I served it over white rice and mixed some of the sauce into the rice as it cooked. I did as some others suggested and brushed salmon with sauce 3-4 times as it cooked. Otherwise I did not open grill at all. Poured a genourous amount of sauce overtop all seconds before eating. Only real modification was that i used a alder plank rather than a cedar.

VERY GOOD!!  Didn't change a thing.  It was a little spicy when tasting alone, but was perfect once on the salmon.  It had just the right amount of spicy sweet flavor.  I put salmon on top of whole grain rice, then poured a little of the left over sauce on top.  FANTASTIC!

I LOVED this recipe. Only thing that I added was peppercorns on top and baked for 25 minutes. I basted the salmon a few times while the sauce thickened and had leftover,  so we had enough to dip each piece of salmon in the sauce. SO FREEEKING DELICIOUS! I seriously just wanted to drink the sauce.

Served to rave reviews from entire family! All agreed this was the best Salmon recipe ever tasted! I followed the recipe exactly except simmered the sauce for at least 40 minutes instead of the 15 suggested. It took that much time to reduce to a syrupy texture. Will make this again and again!

I am always trying to do new things with Salmon, it is, after all, my family's favorite fish.  This was wonderful.  So much so, I made it twice in one week, and shared with my visiting parents.  Okay, so I don't measure the ingredients, just put in as much as looked good.  AND, I used it to glaze the fish about three times while cooking, so there was no need to serve any extra sauce on top at the table.  My four year old LOVED it.  He's my favorite and most honest critic.  Freeze left over sauce to use again next time for ease on week nights.

This was our first time grilling salmon on a plank. It sure was amazing how much the plank gave flavor to the salmon. We decided on this sauce because we liked the ingredients of sweet and spice. However I was at the stove top for 45 minutes and the sauce wasn't getting thick like syrup. I followed the instructions to a tee. I had my laptop there and since I had plenty of time to read I saw many reviews complaining about the same problem. Luckily I had a small amount of pineapple juice left and mixed 2T of cornstarch in that and finally my sauce was thickened to the syrup consistency. Once the sauce was thickened it did taste good, a bit on the sweet side with all that honey and sugar. The salmon was tender and moist full of flavor from the plank.

Excellent!  My family loved the recipe.  Although the recipe includes cayenne pepper, it is not too hot.  I love garlic so I increased the garlic powder to 1/2 teaspoon.  I used some of the sauce to saute whole mushrooms to serve with the salmon fillets.....perfect!  Tip: The sauce needs to simmer much longer than 15 minutes to thicken....more like 40-45 minutes.  Note, however, that it will continue to thicken as it cools after being removed from heat.

I'm making this AGAIN tonight!  I make it exactly as stated.  Tonight I'm making it with salmon and  giant prawns for DH birthday.  Don't be afraid of the sauce, it smells a little strong when your cooking it down but TASTES fantastic!  Like other reviewers, it took about 35-40 minutes to get the sauce to the consistency that I wanted. *************FANTASTIC!!!*****************

I made this for a dinner party and it was a HUGE success.  I didn't have straight pineapple juice so I used a pineapple/mango nectar instead. The fish had a nice smokey flavor and the sauce was heaven.  Paired perfectly with grilled veggie kabobs and a white sangria.  I highly recommend this recipe!

WOW, this is the best Salmon recipe i've tried and i've tried many!!  My sugestion for the sauce, let it simmer a lot longer (about 30-45min. to really get the syrup consistancy) before you let it cool!!  PERFECT!!  I'll be making this one over and over again!!! :)

Excellent!!  Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. There were six kids ages 4-13 so I only used half the pepper since I was worried about it being to spicy.  A couple of reviewers noted they didn't like it since the sauce overpowered the smoky flavour.  We didn't find that to be the case.  The salmon had a great smoky flavour.  We soaked the board for 24 hours though and the longer you soak the boards the greater the smoky flavour.

This was my very first dish from that I made. Super easy and I loved the sauce it was sweet with a little bit of spicy kick to it. 
I live in Seattle so Salmon is a staple. Always looking for new ways to cook it. I do not have a gril so I baked the salmon in the oven an it work just as well. All my guest thought it was great.

My boyfriend and I eat a lot of fish and this is the best salmon I've ever made at home. Definitely going to make this again! 

As a reviewer mentioned earlier, don't let the spice of the glaze worry you, it's perfect once it's actually on the fish.

Excellent recipe. Good mix of sweet and tangy! Squeeze some lemon on that beeotch and its quite good. I used some salmon I bought from costco (frozen) and it turned out 5 star worthy indeed.

We LOVE the flavor of this recipe - it's my hubby's new favorite. But I've made it twice now, and I can't get it thicken!  I've even simmered it for up to 30 mins... We've alternatively used it as a marinade which works just fine!

This is about the best salmon recipe I have ever tried!  Even folks who don't like fish love this.  A little of the sauce goes a long way - I usually divide it when making it and freeze the rest for another fabulous dinner.  Even great to use on chicken!  The cedar plank really adds a lot of flavor to dishes. I have tried this on the grill and in the oven and great every time!

I made this with Tilapia instead of Salmon.  The sauce seemed awfully thin, so I ended up simmering for about an hour, and added a finely chopped onion about 30 minutes in.  It came out a wonderful consistency, a little thinner than syrup, and the flavor was out of this world.  This will be one of our new regular recipes, as it is now one of our favorites!

This was easy and delicious! Instead of grilling them, I baked them in the oven on 350'F for 20 minutes and they turned out great! I also suggest you serve it with some of the sauce and slices of lemon atop the salmon. The lemon juice balances out the sweetness of the sauce. I'm making these again tomorrow for our Sunday family dinner. Thanks for this recipe! :)

We thought it was way to peppery and we usually like spicey. We liked the other flavors and might make it again but adjust it a bit.

I tried this recipe last night and was very impressed. I have never used cedar planks, so that was an expreience, but loved it. I was temped to merinate the salmon but did not know if it would be 'too much', but followed the recipe as written. Has anyone tried marinating? I did baste it more during cooking rather than just spoon over at the end. The salmon was so moist. I did put burbon in the soaking water for the plank and then rubbed a very small amount of sea salt on the plank.

Wow - SOOO good!  My husband was worried that I was deviating from our previous "favorite" recipe for preparing salmon, but I think this is now his "new" favorite! Two thumbs up from both of us - and our teenage son, too! :-)

I tried this recipe last summer and it was DELICIOUS!  It was my first try at plank cooking and my friends loved it.  I'm going to make it again tomorrow with some grilled eggplant slices and asparagus on the side.

The salmon was delicious. I didn't really measure the ingredients but the sauce firmed up in about 45 minutes and really became thick. I added more pineapple juice so I could marinate the salmon. I marinated the salmon for 2 hours with the entire sauce and cooked it on the grill with an All Cad grill. I couldn't find a cedar board so I used the grill instead. Worked fine. Great recipe and easy. I may use it with other meats. Thanks for the recipe and it is awesome.

It was funny, after reading all the reviews about not being able to get the glaze to thicken (or it taking a much longer time) I ended up overcooking mine---it was so thick and sticky you couldn't get the spoon out of it!  :)  (Not the recipes fault!)  However, next time I am going to make a rub out of the dry ingred. instead and try that.  This was the first time I've done any plank cooking.  It imparted alot more smoke flavor than I expected.

This had fantastic flavor but sauce really needs to simmer about 45 minutes to thicken.  One of my favorite salmon recipes.

Very good and easy - first time cooking on a plank and used one Hickory and one Cedar.  The Hickory was more flavorful and more popular.  I loved the sauce and a little goes a long way (it was a bit too much spice for my son).  Great easy recipe for a big gathering/bbq.

Absolutely best salmon recipe we have used. We used untreated cedar plank from old tree we had planed last year. The plank was a little thick & we were a little hesitant that it wouldn't cook completely, but it cooked within time frame recommended & was delicious with a delicate smokey flavor! And then the sauce was the kicker: delicious! thank you!

Fantastic! I made this for the first time tonight and it was a hit! I didn't change a thing recipe wise but I did bake it at 350 for 25 min as suggested by another reviewer since I didn't have a cedar plank. Soooo good.

If you enjoy salmon, you'll love this.  I made it for company last weekend and I received the 5 stars.  My wife and I eat ALOT of fish, especially salmon.  I'm not sure that we've ever had a better fish recipe outside of a fine restaurant.  Run, don't walk to the store to get the cedar planks and other ingredients, and try this recipe.  You'll thank me for that advice.

I gave this 2 stars cuz the sauce is wonderful..unfortunately, so good, that it cancels out the flavor of the cedar plank.  Sauce great on chicken or ribs in the oven or the grill w/out the cedar plank.  You can't taste the "cedar-ness" with this recipe.  The best I've found so far is a mix of mayo, whole grain mustard (3:1 ratio) S and P  and fresh chopped dill (just a tad) spread over top. It brings out the cedar flavor w/out being over the top.  I will use the sauce again, just not for this recipe.

Didn't dissapoint. Was really yummy! Only thing I changed was I cooked mine in the oven without the cedar planks and added garlic since I like garlic in everything. I'm sure on the grill would be even better!

This was our first time cooking with a cedar plank. The sauce was absolutely perfect and fantastic and delicious. I wanted to vary on a couple things but I'm glad I didn't because I loved it just the way it is. The cedar plank is great and we cooked the salmon perfectly, adding some fresh lemon slices to the top of the filets. We will be making this again when we can share it with some friends. YUM!

Excellent! The sauce was so fantastic!  I might try to marinate the salmon in some of the sauce before grilling to get even more of that flavor. I will make this again.

This was my first time having salmon and I definitely picked the perfect recipe to prepare it with.  The glaze really brought out the best in this fish. The sauce was a bit thin at first but I added a touch of cornstarch and that thickened it up nicely.  Since I had pineapple left over I threw that on the plank next to the salmon.  It went well served with rice.  Can't wait to make this again soon!

I had to bake instead of grill and ended up using canned chunks of pineapple instead of just juice, it wasnt as much of a syrup but it tasted great! everyone loved it.

We love this salmon recipe - I thought that I had wrote a review on this before, but apparently I have not. My daughter who hates most fish really enjoyed this recipe. Because I was out of many of the items...I subbed the honey with agave, pineapple juice with orange juice and brown sugar w/ with white sugar and a tbsp of molasses. The cayenne brings a nice heat to the fish. Note....YOU MUST SOAK YOUR CEDAR PLANKS....We were distracted and did not notice that the water had drained...spent about 30 mins straight trying to soak them...needless to say, half way through they caught fire and we had to hose down the BBQ. We removed the fish, put it on a cookie sheet, threw it back on the grill and let it finish...believe me....it had the cedar smoked flavor - haha. GREAT recipe, highly recommend!

I have now made this 3 times, twice for guests. Both sets of guests said it was better than salmon from a restaurant. The cooking times work perfectly and the salmon is never dry. The sauce is wonderful, seems to suit all palates! Thank you for a recipe that will be a family favourite for years to come!

This received high marks from all of the Make-Ahead Mamas and our kids! Combine the marinade and freeze separate from the fish (we get the pre-shrink wrapped frozen filets at a warehouse/club store). Thaw the fish in the refrigerator the night before serving, and add it to the marinade 1-24 hours before grilling. Your family and friends will be impressed, with hardly any effort!!

Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly (although it took more like 45 minutes to reduce the glaze). I will definitely make this again.

this was awesome and a huge hit. it took 45 minutes + to get the glaze syrupy and I used half the amount of black pepper.
the key though was wild fresh copper river salmon. only available for 3 weeks out of the year! yowza!

Excellent!  I was in a hurry & really didn't measure anything - even used on-hand grapefruit juice instead of the pineapple.  As was just 1 piece for myself, I used the oven. Usually I smother salmon in tartar sauce, but no need here.  This is definitely a keeper!

There's about 1/2 cup left, so I'm going to use on some prawns in the freezer our neighbour caught here off Vancouver Island.  Mmmmmmm.

Instead of grilling, i cooked it in the stove and it was absolutely amazing.  It is my favorite salmon recipe.  I cooked it for my sister and she said that she wouldn't be getting salmon at a restaurant anymore.  I then cooked it for my family and my dad who has never liked salmon said he really liked it. (i was surprised he even tried it!)
Wonderful recipe!

Outstanding!  I will be making this again and again, one of the best things I've ever cooked.  I didn't use a plank of any kind, I simply cooked it in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes.  The sauce stayed a thin consistency for me, but that was fine, I just poured it over the fish before and after baking.  This sauce has a little punch to it, but my boyfriend who hates spicy food didn't find it too hot.

So sad there aren't more stars. I followed the recipe to the letter, the second time not so much and it still truned out great. The first time my Alder planks started on fire ( I left the heat on to long) but was able to save the salmon. The second time I used cedar planks and we think we like the Alder planks better, Maybe it was the extra smoke from the fire that added all that flavor.

Made this recipe over the Memorial weekend and it was a great success.  Two NYC professional chefs were guests and they both asked for the recipe.  Can't think of a greater compliment!

Awesome marinade! Although I did not use a cedar plank but the fish came out beautifully straight on the grill. I marinated over-nite and the flavors really pop'd. I didn't use the recommended amount of honey or spices, I was light on the honey and heavy on the spices, & will definitely be trying this again!

Kind of disapointing.  The sauce never thickend,I even made sure and re-read the recipe to make sure I did not forget anything.  Did not really care for the flavor of the paprika in the sauce.  The plank cooking of course turned out great just not the sauce.

This has become my family's Go To Recipe for salmon. Even my son, who doesn't like fish, likes it when we use this marinade. It's a very versatile recipe, and can be used for when company is coming or when you're just making family dinner.  We've used it in the oven with success, too.

I was a little worried about the amount of sugar and honey along with the pineapple juice.  I thought it would be too sweet, but it's not.  It's very good.  The sauce caramelizes around the edges of the fish while grilling.  YUM!  The only thing I did different was to marinate the salmon in some of the sauce before grilling it.

I cooked this according to the recipeand it was awesome!  Probably had more than twice the amount of sauce that was necessary, but I'd rather have to much than run short.  Thanks for a super recipe!

AMAZING!!! Since I didn't have all the ingredients I used orange juice instead of pineapple juice and used more brown sugar since I only had 1/2 cup of honey.  The salmon was super moist and tender and soooo flavorful.  P.S since I had a lot of extra sauce, I used it as a dressing on coleslaw the next day, also amazing.

I smoked these on my BGE and I have to say this is the ABSOLUTE BEST Salmon I have ever had.  The second best was a 5* restaurant in Minneapolis named Horton's.  This is one that will definitely WOW your company.  Oh and I didn't do the Bourbon...  I may give that a try next time --otherwise I followed the recipe.

Wow. I was disappointed.   I made this recipe because of the reviews. I was sure I had a winner. I'm sure it's my personal taste, but I found this sauce to be TOO strong. It overpowered, rather than enhanced, the cedar flavour.  Anyway, I'd still say give it a try. Chances are you will like it. I seem to be in the minority here. I just wanted more of that smokey flavour.

I did it both ways, on the grill for my sister and I then in the oven when my fiance got home from work...the grill was a little more flavorful.  Also, I like my salmon more of a medium well to well temperature so I left it on a few extra minutes.  I will be using this recipe many more times in the future....thank you!!!

I followed the recipe as is, but baked in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes as I didn't have any cedar planks. My husband RAVED about this recipe! He said it was hands down the best salmon he's ever had. He couldn't stop talking about it through all of dinner! My son (4) thought it was a little too spicy and didn't care for it. I used frozen salmon, but think it would have been even better had it been fresh. I also can't wait to try the sauce on chicken! Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!!!

Yummy! Just made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was delish! I didn't have any cedar planks so I just baked it in the oven at 325 degrees for 25 minutes as someone suggested. My only edit would be skipping the brown sugar - it was just a tad too sweet with the honey. I threw the salmon on top of a bed of spinach and used the sauce as a dressing. It was perfect!

Good recipe!  I didn't have cedar planks, so I used the sauce for my salmon.  Unfortunately I let the sauce boil too long and it had a molasses-like consistency.  After cooking the salmon for a while with the sauce, it tasted a little too peppery to my liking, so I sprinkled extra brown sugar into the sauce and pressed it into the salmon with a spoon.  Delicious!

We just got done doing the dishes after eating this fabulous salmon outside right before the sunset...ahhhh. Loved it and I will make it again. Because of me not watching it closely the only mistake I made was allowing the plank to catch on fire on the grill...I over heated it thinking I would get more 'smoke' before cooking the salmon. I got more smoke all right!! At any rate the salmon cooked wonderfully and taste was great. I did not have the pineapple juice, used apple juice so I doubled the amount of lemon juice, & I simmered it longer. I wanted a thicker sauce. Too bad I did not see this one at the START of summer!

Incredible.   I didn't have enough honey (only 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup), but it was still great.  In fact, me and hubby liked it so much, we made it two nights in a row!

This recipe is the first one I tried for cedar plank smoking. When I was reading the ingredients for the sauce, being that I can't tolerate a lot of spice, I got cold feet and cut the cayenne pepper and paprika by 1/2. After I made the sauce and tasted it, it was spicy, and I was afraid that the end product would be too spicy. I followed the rest of the recipe and the salmon turned out perfect, just the combo of the salmon, grilling, smoking and spice. Can't wait to make it again. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

My new favorite way to prepare salmon!  Usually people write about how they changed the recipe to make it better, but I wouldn't change a thing.  The only thing I do different is use alder planks, because I have a ton of them.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe...it will definitely win you over!

I (and my wife) were absolutely blown away by this recipe! I have been trying to get away from the steak/burger/chicken routine on the grill, and this gave me the perfect opportunity to try something new. Also my first time grilling with cedar planks - another great discovery!  I served the fish with Jasmine rice and grilled veggies - I drizzled a little sauce over the rice and veggies and it seemed to just bring the whole dish together. I have tried many new recipes on here with a lot of success, but this one is my personal favorite to date! :-)

Delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly.  Left out the bourbon and used only a little over 1/4 tsp cayenne.  It was still a bit too spicy as a dipping sauce for my kids but it was PERFECT on the fish.  One note about the sauce - it won't necessarily look syrupy in the hot pan but thickens as it cools b/c of the honey so just follow the times listed rather than waiting for it to look thick.

This recipe is amazing.  The cedar smoke flavor perfectly accents the sweet pepper honey sauce.  This is on my regular list now.  I just make extra sauce to reuse!

I was looking for a great plank salmon recipe and this is it! Delicious and super easy, our salmon was perfect. My 12 year old daughter declared it the only way to eat salmon. I followed the wine recommendation, but went with a sparkling Rose which worked out quite well, as we're hot here in the coastal south now.

In looking for a recipe for salmon, I ran across this one and I must say that I would rate it 10 stars if I could.  This was served with guests and was a hit even with kids who did not think they liked salmon.

I really liked this sauce too!  I didn't have the cedar planks for the salmon but just rubbed a little olive oil on the fish before putting on the grill.  This worked out great.  I think I will try the left over sauce on some chicken wings.  I think it will be great on those.

This recipe is a keeper. The fish was moist and full of flavor. I ended up grilling for a little longer with the grill top open because the plank kept catching on fire.

Oh my gosh this salmon is AMAZING!! We are big fans of salmon and usually use the same recipe so last night I decided to try this (it was also our first time using a cedar plank). WOW, the sauce is sooo good. we cooked some white rice and I added a little bit of the sauce to the rice along with some extra soy sauce to make it not so thick. The flavor was delicious and we will definately be making this more often. Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe!!

This is one of my all time favorites. My wife usually doesn't like salmon (except sashimi), but she loves this!  The salmon is moist as butter and not the slightest bit dry. We only make two pieces of salmon, but make the full amount of sauce and dribble it over some jasmine coconut rice as a side dish.

My boyfriend and I have salmon quite often, so I am always looking for different ways to have salmon outside of the generic Asian sauce, which is what I was afraid this would be at first. It does not now, however taste like a teriyaki or anything like that. It is VERY sweet and has a kick, but the spice was not overwhelming for us. I couldn't distinguish any particular flavors that stood out other than sweet and a little spicy, but it was good. I used half honey and half agave, and I had a hard time thickening it on the stove, so I used a cornstarch slurry and boiled for a few minutes. It thickened up to a beautiful sauce, and the salmon did not need more seasoning than salt and pepper with this sauce. Over all it was good, but only if you like sweet sauces on salmon!

AMAZING!! THANK YOU JMCURTAIN FOR SHARING:) It's the kind of recipe that makes you sad when you only have one more bite left. I wish I could add some suggestions but REALLY IT WAS JUST THAT GOOD. I thought if anything it was more sweet than spicy, and it was just the right amount of both:). The only thing I did different was bake it wrapped in tin foil for 15 minutes at 425F. Can't wait to cook it the right way on the plank:) Then it will be THE BEST SALMON I EVER HAD!!!

Delicious.  Definitely took me 45 minutes to thicken the sauce.  However, it thickened more upon cooling.  Wish I had marinated the salmon a bit...

Unnecessarily complex marinade.  The Prep and cook time are inaccurate.  Took waay too long to put this together, and then it didn't thicken.  My boys liked it, but think I'll stick to my much simpler marinade next time.

I didnt have pineapple juice so i substituted orange juice and that worked too. So yummy! I didnt have the planks either so I just pan fried it. Even the kids loved it. We used it on salmon and turkey. Excellent recipe Thank you!

I make a recipe from this site almost nightly, and I must say that I think this is in my personal top 3! Unfortunately, I did not have all of the ingredients as specified, so I had to use orange juice instead of pineapple, La Choy Original Sauce & Marinade instead of soy sauce, canola oil instead of olive, and I accidentally doubled the garlic (whoops). Also, I didn't have any cedar planks, so I just tossed everything together pan fried (with a lid on the pan!) the fish on medium heat, seven minutes per side (adding sauce as I went). PERFECTION! And it wasn't too spicy for the hubster.

I really like this recipe.  I made the following alterations (half recipe): substituted orange juice (reduced calorie) for pineapple juice, substituted cider vinegar for white vinegar, left out the cayenne and added 1/4 tsp of salt.  I also seared the salmon on one side in olive oil for about 5 minutes.  I then removed the salmon from the pan and poured in the sauce in the same pan I cooked the salmon in.  I cooked the sauce on medium to medium low for about 10 minutes.  I then returned the salmon to the pan, basted the salmon with the sauce and put in the oven for 4 minutes at 375F.  The salmon came out perfectly!

This recipe has helped me convert three (3) of the most difficult fish haters to absolutely LOVING salmon (only THIS salmon). And it's been requested several times since the first try.

This is an amazing recipe!  I was so impressed with how the sauce turned out.  I used real garlic instead of garlic powder, and increased the cayenne because we like it SPICY.  I glazed the salmon with the sauce several times during grilling.  I will make this again, especially for company.

only changes I made were to use a smoker box on the grill since I don't have cedar planks and I used half the hot pepper...was afraid 1/2 tsp would overwhelm the fish/just taste hot n spicy....so I used 1/4 tsp. Even hubby who does not like salmon liked it.

Our entire family LOVED this recipe.  We did however use fresh garlic, agave rather than honey, and we used fresh rainbow trout. It was the best fish we have EVER eaten!

Good flavor. B/c we don't have a grill, I took another reviewer's suggestion and baked it at 350degrees for 25mins, and I also basted it a few times with the sauce.

I liked it a lot.  I wanted to lick the bowl with the sauce, it's so tasty.  But, I cut down the amount of pepper in this recipe, and used Coconut Aminos as a low salt Soy sauce substitute.  I didn't have straight pineapple juice so I opened a can of pineapple chunks in 100% juice and used that.  Some of the pineapples got into it, and they were tasty too! 

Like another reviewer, I added more pineapple juice mixed with thickener, because it took way longer than 15 minutes to thicken (like 45 minutes).   

I would've given this 5 stars with the changes I made, but as written, it's 4.

Love this recipe!!! I always make rice with it and some extra sauce so I can pour it over the rice. I have made this recipe many times and will continue to. I don't change anything, except increasing the sauce.

I made this recipe and have to say, the proportions seemed off.  It was was to peppery.  I like hot/spicy, but this didn't seem to work.  Cayenne overpowered everything.  Try with less cayenne and perhaps it could be a winner.

The sauce tasted okay but it did not enhance the taste of the salmon, if  anything made it too sugary. I will not be making this again.

I just want to say that i never ever write reviews. But for this one i had to, because it was so delicious! My husband doesn't really like fish, but i made this dish and he told me it is the best dish that i have ever made! I didn't even use the cedar planks. I cooked the fish on an indoor grill plate for 10 minutes and then for the remaining 5 minutes cooked it in a foil pouch with the sauce on the grill plate. The only thing i changed was that i used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar and it was so good!

Too much cayenne and we usually enjoy a bit of a bite.  Otherwise not too bad.
This recipe seemed to make way too much sauce and half went down the sink - waste is a big minus in this home..

This was delicious! I didn't use the cedar planks, but we did grill it. I doubled the sauce recipe, but I shouldn't have because there was a ton leftover. I was concerned about the cayenne (I used crushed red pepper instead) but it wasn't too spicy for my 7 year old who really enjoyed it as well. I served over white rice with peas. Will definitely make again!

I make this sauce for salmon, chicken, and turkey. Have made and frozen for future use. Really does take 30+ minutes of stirring to thicken up. As much too sweet for us, I cut back on the sugar. Have made as written but also without a few of the ingredients if I don't have them on hand. Always a winner as long as you don't burn it.

Made this recipe for Father's Day lunch for 10 people. I doubled the recipe for the sauce as mentioned in some of the reviews but followed it exactly. Everyone raved!! Also, since I don't cook a lot of seafood the tip about the "white stuff seeping" out of the salmon to indicate that it was done was excellant!! Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

Made it tonight for the family.  I substituted 1TBSP of white vinegar for apple cider vinegar (I like apple cider vinegar better).  Didn't smell right when it was reducing (which I could have reduced it a little more to get it a little thicker, now I know).  Thought it was going to be a little to sweet when tasted by itself, but on top of the salmon.......winnahs!!!! Didn't use cedar planks but smoked it with mesquite and kiawe for about 30 min at 290ish.  Brushed the sauce on it every 10 mins and BAM!!!!!! Gonna make it again for the rest of the family this sunday.  Excellent recipe. Thinking I might finish it off by brushing a think sauce on the top then broiling it for a minute or two.

Followed th sauce recipe exactly and it was SO good.  My guests LOVED it and went for seconds.  I am not a salmon person but I went for seconds myself.  Didn't have a plank or grill, so just baked in the oven and turned out great.  Sauce thickens if you remove it from the heat/burner.  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe!

I had tried a slightly different recipe in the past, which was already good, but this one is way better. The different spices made it perfect. I think it was the best Cedar Planked Salmon I have ever cooked. Thanks for sharing

Thanks for the recipe.  Salmon Sunday needed something a little different and this hit the spot!!  The spice was pretty good. My wife said this was her favorite to date.

Love the honey/lemon/pepper combo!!  I was short on honey so I topped it up with some Grade A maple syrup.  Outstanding overall, definitely going to kick up the cayenne next time as it wasn't very spicy and the extra heat would take this to another level.  A little wasabi mayo on the side adds just the right kind of creamy kick.  Thanks for sharing!!

The salmon just melted in our mouths. The sauce was sweet, but not overpowering. Great recipe and will make again!

Loved this. Made it as listed with no changes.  The only problem I had was that it kept boiling over even on very low heat, so next time I will use a bigger sauce pan. My friend called it "company good"

This recipe comes out so delicious!!! We've tried it with and without the planks because the marinade is delicious. The planks absolutely make this recipe outstanding, especially when the sugar burns a bit on the fish---and the aroma that is let out as it is grilling..!! OH, SO GOOD!!

This recipe is simple and delicious! It did take 30 minutes or so to get the sauce to thicken, but so easy! A definite keeper.

OH MY YUM!!! So good!! I did everything exactly as directed, EXCEPT I baked it in the oven instead of grilling.(Baked at 350 for 20-25 mins) I did read some reviews and noticed many people said they need to cook sauce for much longer. I found that if you cook it the 15 minutes and set it aside while doing other prep the sauce thickens as it cools off. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing!!!!
