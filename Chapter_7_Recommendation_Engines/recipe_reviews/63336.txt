If you perfer your vegetables mostly tender, cook them briefly first in about an inch of water,(about 1/2 way cooked) then drain and add to browned butter mixture, once the wine is added the butter will slow greatly with browning, watch closely for first signs of browning, wait for nutty aroma, then add wine, then vegetables and allow to simmer.

We loved this and I even forgot the wine! I like the complexity of flavors and textures that really take vegetables beyond ho-hum. The combination of vegetables, the browned butter and toasted almonds gave these vegetables  character, not to mention color and eye appeal. I added the toasted almonds at the end, however, to retain their crunch. This is not your forgettable, lowly vegetable on the dinner plate!

This is GREAT!!!  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is b/c all the butter isn't necessary.  I used 3T. and even that I thought was too much.  To cut some cals I think I'm going to sautee in UnChix broth.  I'll finish w/1 T. of browned butter.  Totally forgot to add the wine, but it was great w/o.  I added the onions, garlic and almonds at the same time so they would sweeten and tenderize as well.  Used red onion for added sweetness.  This time I only used broccoli, but I see this method arising time and time again w/different vegetable combos!!!  Great for a vegetarian diet if u can cut some of the fat!

I used less butter, toasted almond slivers first, browned the butter, red onion, green beans, red bell pepper, Zucchini, and yellow squash, added the garlic powder, salt and pepper and the toasted almonds; then added the wine towards the end. DELISH!

Used yellow & purple cauliflower along with the broccoli and red onion. Threw in mushroom slices - people very impressed by festive autumn colors. Used 25% less butter than it called for - it was sufficient.
Tasted great! - Highly recommended as an easy to make, unique and impressive side dish. Used it along with Prinme Rib.

Loved the combination of flavors in this side dish! Before making this dish I boiled a pot of water, added the broccoli and cauliflower and let it cook for a minute, drained, and set aside. I also toasted some almonds. I used only a 1/4 cup butter because I thought a 1/2 cup was a bit too much. In the skillet with butter, I added a piece of garlic, chopped, then the red bell peppers, wine, broccoli and cauliflower. I stirred to combined on medium low heat. I seasoned with salt and black pepper, to taste. Lastly, I added the toasted almonds over everything. The browned butter with almonds gave this a nutty flavor to these vegetables. I loved the tenderly crunch from the red bell peppers and its sweetness. The bright red color of the red bell peppers looked so pretty in this dish. I liked the aroma of the butter with wine and garlic. The almonds gave this a nice texture with a nutty crunch. I served alongside with incredible cheesey turkey meatloaf and bacon rosemary mashed potatoes, from this website.

This was amazing!  So easy and great flavors.  I make a different vegetable dish each week for a family dinner, and this is the first one that my brother asked when I would make it again.

A few notes:
- I only used 1/4 cup butter
- instead of the garlic salt & garlic pepper (don't have any of that), I used 1/2 tsp VegeSal (you could just use salt), 1/2 tsp pepper, and 1/2 tsp minced garlic

This was good, and even though I shudder at the amount of butter in it, I went willingly! :-)  I used garlic powder rather than garlic salt, but did sprinkle some garlic salt on the veggies toward the end.  Wasn't familiar with garlic pepper, so just added fresh ground black pepper.  Needed to use up some pinot grigio wine and the veggies I had on hand (yellow summer squash, zucchini, sweet potato, broccoli, onion; the broccoli & sweet potato were especially good). Per review by recipe submitter, Wilemon, I did steam the veggies for about five mins before adding to skillet.  Thank you, Wilemon!

This was a wonderful side dish! I used broccoli & little button mushrooms; I made more butter than called for; I did not use onions because my daughter & grandson were eating w/ us & neither of them likes onions, so I subbed onion powder for flavor instead. What they don't know won't hurt them. ;o) I didn't have fresh red peppers so I used jarred roasted red pepper instead. The wine I used was a chardonnay. We will be having this over & over again....thanks!

I think I have discovered the brown butter accidentally on my own by being too busy with other pans on the stove.. But when I read how great it taste...I knew this was a recipe I needed to try...since I was well aware of how good browned butter taste. I think you could go with just about any vegetables you have in stock. I used, broccoli, carrots, scallions and red bell peppers. I didn't use a whole stick of butter probably  a wee bit over half, and also add some fresh minced garlic so left the garlic salt out...and used unsalted butter. I will use this again when whipping of vegetables for any meal. I think I'll use some mushrooms next time and cut further down on the butter, and rely on the moisture from the mushrooms. Oh I'm sure almonds would have been wonderful but I had none...still a wonderful dish.

Excellent. I didn't use almonds, but did use a sweet white wine. So Good! Will definitely use about 1/2 less butter next time.

Not terrible, but so shockingly unhealthy dripping in butter.  I know much healthier ways to cook vegetables that taste better.

Mmmmm, these were great!  I was looking for a veggie dish for Thanksgiving that wasn't your typical soup/cheese with broccoli and cauliflower casserole!!  I steamed my broccoli and cauliflower for a bit and then added to my red peppers and onions.  I did significantly reduced the butter, as others have mentioned.  Also toasted my almonds beforehand and added at the very end, just before serving.  Really simple and easy side dish that I will make often and switch up the veggie combos!!

Good. I used lemon pepper as I didn't have any nor have I seen it at the store before. I recommend toasting the sliced almonds in the oven or on the stove top so they get noticeably crunchy as cooking them with the vegetables does not achieve this. If using frozen vegetables (I used 'California' mix) I also recommend steaming then tossing with the butter mixture, otherwise it becomes all water-y and the nuttiness of the browned butter is lost (that's what happened to me!). Will make again.

Excellent dish to take to a potluck. I lightly steamed the fresh coarser veggies I used first before putting them all in the frying pan. Used the leftovers in soup. Yum!

I've never been so excited about getting a second helping of vegetables.  Absolutely loved these.  Didn't have bell pepper on hand, but I'm sure it's just as good with it.

I admit - I changed things.  I do this base and add it to ALL of my veggies - as well as rice dishes!! :  I toast the almonds for about 2 minutes in the oven, brown the butter on med-low with garlic salt and onion powder, add the almonds...and continue stirring until the butter turns brown - and then mix in whatever veggies/rice/chicken dish that I have.  This is TO DIE FOR!!  I typically am not a fan of veggies....let alone almonds, but there is something about this combination that leaves me craving veggies!!  My sister made it and agrees!!  If you have picky eaters - you gotta try this!

Yummy recipe. I've made it twice reducing the butter on the second time and it was still great with 3/4 of the amount of butter. I steamed the veggies for just a couple of minutes beforehand both times.

Delicious! I didn't use bell pepper and only had fresh-frozen broccoli and cauliflower and it still came out great. Fresh veggies would have been better but this was really good! Hubby and I both liked it a lot.

OMG!! My picky 13 year old loved these vegggies. I used a bag of raw cauliflower, broccoli, and baby carrots. (No Peppers). Cooked them aliitle longer than called for. We like our veggies just a tad on the soft side when we eat them. Almost forgot, we didnt add the almonds. I know for sure it would not have been a hit with the guys. Great way to make veggies. we were just so tired if steamed.

yummy! used the veggies listed with just a little salt, 4 tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp olive oil. No spices, but I had seasoned garlic almonds. Delicious! I pre-steamed the broccoli & cauliflower for 2 minutes in the microwave and then sauteed them to perfection.

I loved it!  Even without all the ingredients, like onion & red pepper (I was working with what I had on hand), it was delicious.  Best of all, it was easy and packed a lot of flavor for my minimal effort.  Thanks!

This recipe was great.  I made it with a bag of frozen brocolli, cauliflower and carrots. I boiled that mix for a few minutes and then followed the rest of the recipe (using less butter though).  It was delicious.

I took Wilemon's suggestions and briefly cooked the broccoli and cauliflower in a little water before adding it to the browned butter. Instead of garlic salt and garlic pepper, I used fresh minced garlic and lemon pepper. This vegetable side dish is delicious--no leftovers. Whatever my family did not eat, I did.

shockingly good!  Didn't have the almonds but was good without.  I used a very sweet wine, it was all I had, but was still very good!  I also used real garlic with salt and pepper.  Added zucchini and carrots and cut all the veggies small.

My girlfriends 9 year old daughter really liked this one. It's usually hard to get kids to eat vegetables, but this recipe went over very well. I'm not a big vegi fan either, and I thought they were awesome.

Delicious!  I used more cauliflower than broccoli (didn't have a full 2 cups of broccoli on hand) but totaled the two out to 4 cups, and I also didn't have any bell peppers but used a bit more onion than called for (I used a large red onion and cut it into 2-3 inch strips rather than diced it).  I also took a reviewer's advice and pre-cooked my broccoli and cauliflower a bit, boiled them in some chicken broth for flavor.  A very yummy way to spice up your vegetables!

This is so good if you add a tsp of red pepper flakes, and omit the nuts that makes it a 4...... I made some with the nuts and no spiciness and they were about a 3.

This was very tasty! My 4yo and 2yo enjoyed it as well. For those who didn't taste the 'nuttiness,' make sure you let the butter brown - this takes at least 10-15 minutes on low-medium heat - otherwise you just get the 'plain' butter taste. I also decreased the butter by 1/3 - still delicious. The almonds accented the dish perfectly. I served it with shrimp scampi and garlic bread.

Enjoyed!  I halved the butter and it could still be decreased.  I steamed my veggies for several minutes beforehand  because my girls won't eat crisp tender veggies, however they wouldn't touch these.  Regardless, my husband and I liked them.  Might make again with the a slight decrease in butter.

Yum! Celeste said, "If you haven't tried this recipe yet, you should." So I did, and she was right. I like my veggies barely tender, so I cut them into large chunks and florets instead of 'chopping' them, blanched the broccoli and cauliflower quickly as the submitter recommended (I threw the red pepper in at the end, just to heat it). I followed the butter/almond instructions exactly, using garlic powder with salt and pepper because I don't have garlic salt or garlic pepper. Excellent! Thanks!

Made this last night and loved it! Never heard of garlic pepper so I just sprinked in some pepper and garlic powder. Added a few sliced mushrooms since I had that on hand, next time I would add more cause I love mushrooms.  A versatile dish that I would try with different veggies in future. I only used 1/4 cup butter and it tasted nice'n buttery. I used almonds and pecans. The nuts definitely make the dish stand out.

Broccoli and Cauliflower have found their soul mate! I made this tonight and loved it so much that I made more of the butter with seasoning and then I spooned cooked basmati rice over it and cooked just long enough to infuse the flavor. We served these with rice and grilled pork chops. I will definantly keep this recipe handy- it would be great to serve when entertaining!

Very tasty.  Made as directed except used salt, pepper, and a dash of garlic powder.  this was a very colorful side dish to accompany white fish.  My husband raved about it.  Will definitely make again.  I may try snap green beans in it next time.

This was just ok.  I guess I learned that I really prefer my veggies steamed, grilled or roasted.  Not bad, but I probably won't fix it again.

I used cashews on green beens and it was fantastic. So don't feel that you have to make such an array of vegetables to make this recipe work for you.

VERY good recipe! I wasn't sure at first of the ingredient combo and the kids, but even they woofed it down. Pretty easy to make, too! The only thing is that it takes MUCH longer than 5 minutes to cook. But, other than that, very tasty.

Too much butter, but great overall end result. Husband loved it. I added mushrooms and used fresh garlic in place of the garlic salt/pepper.

This was pretty good. I didn't have any wine. I was hoping for more of a nutty taste. I'm not sure if because I didn't use the wine it made a difference. I will try again though.

Great skillet recipe. I wanted a slightly crunchier alternative to your standard brocolli and butter. This fit the bill perfectly. The brown butter was elegant and more complex. A keeper!

These were just okay. I wanted to make a special vegetable dish for my fiance, and went out and bought all the ingredients for it... but I should have stuck with my usual olive oil and seasoning recipe... these were WAY too rich with all that butter. I didn't want to eat them, knowing what was in them, and he liked my other, simpler recipe better.

Another great recipe from Wilemon! We loved it! I think you could use any vegetable you want, but I loved this combination. I would probably steam carrots a few minutes first if I was using them. You really should try her Delectable Marinated Chicken, here on AR (boneless thighs)
it's so good!

This was easy and delicious...and any combination of your fav veggies will work! I used what I had on hand: celery, cabbage, onion, yellow and green peppers...and I probably used half of the butter the recipe calls for. Will definitely do this again!

We really enjoyed these veggies with salmon.  They were a colorful, tasty addition to our meal.  Since I was increasing the servings, and I didn't have a skillet large enough to really cook the veggies in the skillet, I steamed everything except the onions (which I sauteed in the butter).  The butter never actually had enough time to brown--my fault.  Next time I will try with fewer servings, and I think the veggies will stay crisper.

This is a great way to clean up left overs from the frig. I through in potatoe wedges with the mixture from the recipe and yum. I was just making it for me but my husband wanted some too. Next we are going to cook up some rice and chicken chunks too. Wonderful, versatile recipe. Mmm...I loved it.

Really good!  I had a total of about four pounds of broccoli and cauliflower.  I doubled the butter and seasonings rather than tripling them (like the vegetables), since some felt that it was too much butter.  But  next time I will  use as much as it calls for, because I don't  think it will be overdoing it.  Great for HFLC diet!

This was great! I didn't need much, so I scaled this way down and just eyeballed the ingredients. For both the frozen cauliflower and fresh broccoli, I microwaved them beforehand for about 2 min. I didn't want to cut a pepper for a small amount, so I used a handful of frozen multi-colored peppers. I loved the nutty flavor of the browned butter, along with the almonds. This would work great as a one-dish meal, adding chicken, beef or shrimp. I really enjoyed this, and thanks for the recipe, Wilemon!
