Oh, is this a winner!  With a few little  "adjustments," this is easily a 5-star dish, one I enjoyed every bite of.  I cut the chicken into strips, floured it, but didn't season it with salt and pepper until it was in the skillet, sautéing in olive oil (pure, not extra virgin, for its higher burning temperature). When it was golden brown  I removed it from the pan as directed, and sautéed the shallots along with some fresh minced garlic and a good handful of chopped red bell pepper, as it seemed this seriously needed some  color. To that I added both mustards, the chicken broth and white wine (which filled in for the vermouth because I was too lazy to go down to the basement, where we keep our liquor and wine, for the vermouth). I gave it a good squeeze of lemon juice but no pulp, then let that reduce somewhat  before I added the cream.  I let that cook over low heat until I had the consistency I wanted, adding more cream and broth as necessary while I tended to the rest of dinner. The chicken was so pretty and golden brown I just couldn't see tossing it with the cream and burying its rich color. Instead, I plated the chicken, spooned some sauce over, and gave it a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley. The chicken was sooo tender, and just delicious against the creamy, slightly tangy sauce. The combination of the two mustards with the rest of the well-chosen ingredients created a sauce that was just exquisite.  This is a simply lovely dish.

I loved this recipe!  The flavors are wonderful.  It's great served over rice pilaf or white rice if you prefer.  The only things I did differently were that I didn't have a shallot so I used a clove of garlic (I'm a big garlic lover).  I also didn't have heavy cream so I used whole milk.  I don't think it matters much since you use so little of it.  The sauce was still thick and rich and really flavorful.  I probably cut a few calories that way.  One of these days I think I might try a bit less butter or half butter, half olive oil.  Just to see if I can make it a bit more calorie friendly.

This combination is amazing. I didn't have vermouth, so I used riesling wine instead. We used thin sliced whole chicken breasts to keep the moisture. Fried on super high heat for a shorter time. Used half butter/half extra-virgin olive oil. Made about double the sauce by doing another set of broth/wine/ after the first reduction, then adding cream to taste.

Wonderful flavor!  I found this recipe when I was looking for a chicken/mustard filling for crepes for Marti Gras.  This was perfect!  I filled whole wheat crepes with this chicken, sauteed spinach and Gruyere cheese and topped them with carmelized onions!  The taste was fanastic!

This was good. I used white wine instead of vermouth and the juice of half a lemon with no pulp. At first I thought the 2 mustards would be overpowering but it wasn't at all. Thanks for the recipe.

I had to improvise with the mustards because I didn't have plain dijon.  I used a maple dijon.  Everyone love it.

This recipe was absolutely top notch.  I also use the mustard sauce with pork tenderloin.

Not bad, but it didn't "wow" me either.  I subbed 2% milk for the cream & marsala for the vermouth.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have the dijon mustard so, considering it was still good, I can only imagine it would be even better with it.

I didn't have vermouth so I used a little marsala.  The recipe was good though, the sauce was tangy and rich.

We enjoyed this.  I did end up adding a little more broth and cream as I thought the dijon flavor was a bit overwhelming but that solved that problem.  I did sub non-fat half n half as I always do for any heavy cream and it was just fine as it always is.  Non-fat half n half is such a great product and will reduce the calories and fat in many recipes that call for heavy cream without sacrificing flavor.  The lemon juice was nice and added a fresh taste to the mustard sauce.

I tried this recipe out on a few friends for a dinner and got rave reviews.  I used a white wine instead of vermouth and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream.  It was a recipe that I will pull and use over and over.

I made some basic substitutions- garlic for shallot, white wine for vermouth, dried for fresh parley, beer & brat for stone ground mustard- and I didn't bother with the flour.  It was great! We served it over white rice with raw spinach and loved it. The sauce had good mustard flavor without being overpowering. I wasn't sure about the lemon, but was happy I added it.

this turned out really good, the sauce had the perfect mustard flavor.  I had to use garlic in place of shallots and dry white cooking wine instead of vermouth.  I did make the chicken a little different.  I rubbed whole raw breast with mild mustard, dipped in bread crumbs, browned in pan then baked while I prepared the sauce.  I added a pinch of fresh tyme to the sauce and served over whole wheat pasta.  I have been looking for a good mustard chicken recipe since having some at a friends wedding last fall.  I've finally found my recipe.

This is a very forgiving recipe!  I didn't have all the ingredients, but played around with what I had and it turned out amazing! 

Here's what I did: 
I sauteed a quarter of an onion, the added half a cup of sherry and reduced it a bit.  Then I added half a cup of heavy whipping cream and nearly 3 TBS of mustard (I had stone ground mustard, not dijon) and cooked until it thickened up.

Served with sauteed kale (with onion and garlic) which went really well!

It ended up being "too much" -- too much flour, too much mustard, too much lemon juice. I added more broth and cream to try to temper the sauce's sourness. Mr. Pickypants still couldn't get past the smell of it. I could eat it, but didn't particularly enjoy it. I plan to rinse off the chicken and reuse it in a chicken and wild rice soup recipe from this site. This is a nice idea, but too heavy-handed for us. Thanks, anyway!

This was really good - my husband loved it! I used whole wheat flour instead of white, I didn't have a shallot at home so I used garlic instead.  I used milk instead of cream and found I needed to use a little thickener at the end.  I found the vermouth a little over powering so I'll up the Dijon and reduce the vermouth next time.

Lovely flavours! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added some thinly sliced red bell pepper and a clove of garlic after sautéing the shallots. There was quite a bit of  chicken and I was wishing for a little extra of the delicious sauce. Next time I think I'll double the amount of the sauce for 4 chicken breasts. Thank you for the lovely recipe!

I doubled the sauce, cooked some penne pasta, and added that to the chicken and sauce.  
I didn't have a shallot, so I diced half a small onion.  Skipped the vermouth, and just doubled the chicken stock, and omitted the parsley & lemon altogether.
Served it with garlic toast.  Everyone LOVED it!
I did cut back on the stone-ground mustard a little, since it looked like it would overpower the sauce, but now I wish I had used the full amount.  (it could have been a bit 'mustardier')  Be sure to let the chicken get browned!
This will be a regular in our family now.

I made this for dinner last night and it was very good.  I used white wine instead of vermouth and used garlic and a chopped red bell pepper in addition to the shallot.  I stirred in fresh baby spinach right at the end just until wilted and served it over egg noodles.  The next time I make this I will pound the chicken very thin and brown it before I slice it.  I just think I will enjoy the texture more.  It was a very tasty dish with a lot of flavor.

Delicious!  I rarely eat chicken but it smelled so good I just had to try!  I didn't cube the chicken and used white wine in place of the vermouth but otherwise followed the recipe.  Served over orzo- this is company-worthy ;)  Thanks Sue!
