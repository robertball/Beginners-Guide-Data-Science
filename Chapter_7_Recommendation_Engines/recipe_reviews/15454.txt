I really liked this sauce, but made a couple small changes too.  Like many others, I added about 1/4 teaspoon sugar to the sauce.  I also changed the minced garlic to garlic powder, with good results.  Use this with the "Pizza Crust for Bread Machine" recipe on this site for a quick and easy home-made pizza dinner!

Was in a pinch thought I had sauce. Simple is good!!!!!!! I will never buy sauce again. I used Italian seasoning, crushed some fresh garlic used more than called for, tiny tiny bit of sugar.Split a french bread in 1/2 and sauced it, lite cheese because I did not have much. Threw on some tomato,peperoni, mushrooms. Whipped up a simple salad and my family raved. I have never made a dinner this simple and fast that they loved this much. THANK YOU

I was out of tomato sauce, so substituted a 6 oz. can of tomato paste and 1 cup water.  I think the flavor was richer with the paste. Doubled the amount of spices, and it turned out very good...what I hoped for in a quick pizza sauce.

This sauce saved my booty when I was making "cheesy pizza dip" from this site, and realized that I didn't have any pizza sauce.  I had everything on hand to make it & it lived up to it's name.  I also added a pinch of sugar.  I will use this next time I make the dip as well.  Thanks Melanie!!

Easy as pie! I use crushed tomato (or puree) so it's a bit thicker.

I have made this sauce just as the recipe states or added a tiny bit of sugar and it tastes good either way. SO cheap to make and tastes just like the stuff you pay $1.50 a can for at the store.

So easy! Made a triple batch of this sauce for two strombolis (recipe is here at this site), and WOW, this was great! Get those cans of tomato sauce on sale and you can save money making your own sauce (and as much as you want) and not have to deal with those small, expensive premade jars at the store...whenever you are craving something that requires pizza sauce!

Great place to start! I added 1/2 can tomato paste and a pinch of sugar. Used 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp Italian seasoning instead of seasonings listed here. Was yummy!

Yes, this sauce was easy, but it definitely lacked flavor. All I could really taste was the tomato sauce. I think I will be looking for another pizza sauce recipe.

Five stars for the easy but as others have I did use fresh garlic and heated mine a bit in the microwave to help the flavors blend a bit.

I have tried this recipe about 8 times now and my family enjoys it with just a couple of changes...I use my fresh garden basil and an Italian seasoning blend as I don't have anything but powdered oregano. It is very quick and easy. Thanks.

This sauce certainly is easy, and it uses pantry staples. Can't get any easier than layering it on a tortilla along with cheese for a quick noontime pizza for the grandkids.

Throw in half a can of tomato paste if you like it a little thicker.  Otherwise, pretty good.

Following the recipe as-is, the sauce was very bland for my taste.  I doctored it up w/ some olive oil, salt & sugar and THEN it was good.

Phew. Thank God I happened to have these ingredients on hand because I'm not sure what I would have done with a half made pizza and NO sauce! Ha. I will say that the next time I make this I will probably add 1/4 teaspoon or 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar to take the edge off of the intense tomato flavor, but other than that it was quick to make and serves its purpose well. Good recipe.

I have made this sauce a few times now.  I rate it 4 stars as it is written.  I would give it 5 stars with the alterations I have since experimented with.  I like to use fire roasted diced tomatoes (a 14.5 oz can drained and then blended), 3/4 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, 2 big cloves of garlic minced.  This version and the original version both make a very thin sauce which I really like and the fire roasted tomatoes add a ton of flavor.  Great, easy recipe!

Very good and can't be any easier to make. I added a generous pinch of white sugar and used a teaspoon of italian seasoning instead of just oregano and basil. Also crushed one big clove and garlic instead of mincing it.

This sauce is delicious! I took the advice of others and added 1/4th tsp of sugar. I make mine a couple hours before and put it in the fridge it makes it really flavorful.

This was pretty bland. I doubled the amount of garlic, oregano, and basil, and I added fresh basil with the cheese as well. I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

I usually make pizza sauce with tomato paste, so this was an interesting experiment. I used a 15 oz. can of sauce because that was all that I had on hand so I doubled the amounts of the spices. I also threw in 1/2 tsp. of white sugar and 1 tsp. of onion powder... end result was very yummy!

I love this recipe! I only make a few changes. I add a little salt and pepper, and I use perfect pinch Italian seasonings by mc cormick instead of the basil and oregano. My husband loves it!

This sauce was good. Very simple and easy prep which I like. I added a couple pinches of sugar like others suggested. I would make again.

Very easy to make and it was the first pizza sauce that I have tried that was not to strong flavored.  I made it exactly as instructed and it turned out pretty darn good.

I needed a quick and easy pizza sauce to make for dinner for some friends coming over and came up on this.  Only changes are some brown sugar and extra garlic.  You seriously do not need to buy pizza sauce from a grocery store anymore.

I didn't like this at all.  I was out of tomato paste (which I've used to make pizza sauce before) so tried this with a can of Hunt's tomato sauce exactly as written.  It was thin and not "tomatoey" enough.  My hubby liked it better than I did but said it was missing something. I'll stick with the store-bought pizza sauce for my homemade pizzas.

This recipe is easy. My own change was adding a half teaspoon of italian seasonings. I did not find it bland. Maybe when I get gutsy enough I'll make my own dough but instead I used refridgerated Pillsbury Pizza Crust dough which comes in a can. Toppings of mozzarella, peppers, mushrooms and olives made an easy, quick dinner.

I have made this for years. My own concoction using the same ingredients. Its easy, no cooking, quick, delicious, and best of all NOT sweet!! For those liking sweet sauce, its easy to add a dab of sugar.

This was a great and easy recipe. I used garlic powder (all I had) instead of the minced garlic and we added a little brown sugar, we don't like it real acidic. It turned out great. Thanks for the recipe Melanie :)

This recipe worked out great in a pinch--I had all the ingredients on hand when I needed a quick, simple pizza sauce for a last minute recipe.  It tasted very good.
Thanks!

My family really enjoyed this sauce on our home made Pizza dough, I substituted Italian Seasoning for the dried Oregano & Basil. Very easy to throw together with ingredients from your pantry.

I tried this sauce when I didn't have the pre-made sauce in my pantry. I really enjoyed this simple sauce, and made it just as the recipe directs. It is especially good on french bread pizza.

Exactly what I was looking for! A lot of other recipes use tomato paste, which I never have. I used fresh oregano and basil because I had some and it was great! I will definitely be making this again!

I think this is a delicious sauce. With that being said, I think there's too much oregano. Next time I'll try reducing it by half. I also added the sugar as suggested by other reviewers and I think it's a must.

I was in a pinch tonight- had my pizza dough rolled out but NO sauce! Searched and found this recipe and wow- what a pleasant surprise! Something so simple tastes so good! Only change I made was to add in a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. Much more economical than buying pizza sauce and tastes great!

This wa really easy, and fast. Best of all it tasted good. I used it with a quick pizza dough recipe I have and I can make a good pizza in 10-15 min. I love to make it when I dont have time to put something together.

I was looking for a good pizza sauce for the pizza dough I have been making.  I used real garlic and followed the suggestions of adding sugar.  While it is not as “thick” as I would like for saucing the pizza its flavor was great and worked very well with the pizza dough!

This was so simple and good! I thought I had tomato sauce, but did not. So I pureed a can of petite diced tomatoes, I thought it might be a little thin, but I made it to put in a casserole so it was fine. I used garlic powder and also added a 1/2 tsp of rosemary (b/c it's my new favorite spice!!). Anyway, I simmered it for about 15 minutes and gave it a taste - wonderful! I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the great recipe.

8 ounces is not much sauce unless you like a pizza on the dry side.  I used a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes, which I crushed.  That made everything kind of runny and with no tomato paste to thicken it I added a small amount of corn starch and doubled all of the other ingredients.  Cooked it.  It thickened up and was delicious.

The first time I made this sauce I found that it ran over the sides of my pizza if I use sauce as the recipe calls for, but when I used crushed tomato, it worked perfectly! Overall, great recipe!

I make this every time I make pizza.  If you use "natural" sauce, you may have to add more flavorings, since there aren't any in the natural sauce.     But this is so light and yummy.

I was looking for a sauce that didn't need tomato paste because I didn't have any.  This is super easy and I thought it was really good!

Simple and delicious!  All I did to change it was to use fresh basil and oregano (have it in my garden so why not).  Would be good with dried as well.  Great, easy recipe!

In my opinion all tomato based sauces needs sugar to cut down on the acidity, I added 1 teaspoon of brown sugar.  I liked that this wasn't really thick allowing some of the water content to seep into the pizza crust.  I chose this recipe for it's small amount called for in the 1-Dish Pepperoni Cheese Pizza Bake from this site but can't wait to try it on a pizza crust I like better, for example, Jay's Signature Pizza Crust.

This was pretty darn good. Really easy to fix, required practically nothing, everything was on hand. I misread and used garlic powder instead of minced garlic, it was fine anyway. Very tomatoey. Almost too tomatoey for my personal tastes. I used a can of tomato paste and a half can of water. Nothing exotic or fancy, but sometimes simple things are the best. This is great if you have really picky eaters since there are no chunks of veggies. Thanks Melanie for sharing!

Was good and would make again.  I did add a bit more garlic and a very little bit of garlic/pepper seasoning.  Also added  about an 1/8 of a tsp sugar.

Very good and very easy! Slightly tangy with just the right amount of flavor as to not overpower to other ingredients. Better than any uncooked pizza sauce attempt I've made. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp. of sugar, and I used Italian Seasoning since I didn't have the oregano and basil. But I think it would have been just as good without the changes.

The quickest, easiest and tastiest pizza sauce I have ever made!  This is easily adaptable to what you have on hand.  If you don't have fresh garlic or don't feel like mincing, substitute 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  If you don't have oregano and basil separately, substitute 1 tsp Italian Seasoning.  I also like to add 1/2 tsp sugar as other reviewers suggested.   Use as the pizza sauce called for in any recipe.  My favorite is the "Pizza Rolls" from this site.

Good sauce if you need something in a pinch. I used garlic powder in place of fresh and also added some onion powder. Comes together quickly and the price is right!

Make this recipe ahead - if you eat it right away it tastes very bland.  I try to make it at least 1-2 hrs ahead of time to give the tomato sauce time to absorb the flavors and hydrate the dried herbs.

The title of the recipe says it all!  I thought I had a jar of pizza sauce on hand, but whoops, I didn't.  Allrecipes.com to the rescue!  This recipe was quickly prepared and while I think it would benefit from some simmering, or at the very least, sitting for awhile to let the flavors blend, I just mixed it up and used it right away.  It was great!  I liked that it has no sugar added--that is the kind of sauce I buy--without sugar.  Thanks for the great, and EASY, pizza sauce recipe!

I like to use a large fresh tomato diced small, minced garlic, and a tablespoon of olive oil and oregano for my pizza sauce.  If I don't have fresh tomatoes available this is a great, quick substitute.

It was really good! My only issue was that, unless you put on a lot of cheese, the sauce can become overpowering after a while. Other than that, it was fine. Also works great as a dipping sauce.

This sauce is a really good, easy base. Personally, I added basil and oregano to taste, and a bit of white sugar, and it was perfect.

Tried this sauce recipe because I didn't have any tomato paste on hand to make the one I usually use. Tweaked with around 1/2 tsp sugar because I like a little bit more sweetness to my pizza sauce, and loved this one! Made the perfect amount and doesn't have the addition of olive oil my other sauce calls for so it cut down on the fat to boot.  My new go-to recipe! Super easy and rave reviews at my house.

I coupled this with cauliflower-pizza-crust and turkey pepperoni. Thank you so much, kept my diet going and fed my pizza craving!

This is basically the recipe that I usually use, except that I use tomato paste and water instead of tomato sauce, for the base. I also add salt and a ton more spices, depending on what flavor I feel like making. Garlic (either dried and ground or fresh and minced) is a staple for sauce.

Been using this recipe for years to make pizza kits! So easy. I allow about 5 oz. sauce per pizza. Will be making it again tomorrow, enough for 8 pizzas.

I used tomato paste and added just enough hot water to make it a liquid, and added twice the seasonings like a previous rater suggested.  It was a little intense and I will try it with just canned sauce next time.  I used it two days in a row.  It made my kitchen smell just like a good pizza parlor!  Smell was perfect.

This is super easy.  Just know that it is very thin.  I chose this recipe because I was out of tomato paste and my dough was already rising for the crust.  I simmered it for awhile as others suggested to thicken it, but it really didn't make that big of a difference.  Other than that, it was pretty good.  Not big on tomato taste, but not bland.  I will probably try the Easy Pizza Sauce I next time with the tomato paste.

Very good recipe. Like others, I used garlic powder, but also added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper to give it a spicy zip. It was great on a hearty, whole wheat crust out of the bread machine and lots of veggies and fresh mozzerella on top. Definitely a make again.

Very tasty and easy.  I will make this again and probably double the recipe for one pizza because it didn't seem to provide enough to cover the pizza sufficiently.  Great recipe.

Good recipe, I added sugar as other reviewera did and a dash or two of salt to smooth out the acid of the tomato.  Thank you for the nice recipe.

I always forget to buy pizza sauce at the store, I don't think I will buy it any more!! This was really good!! Thanks. The only change that I made was to add garlic powder instead of fresh.

I made this recipe in a pinch since I didn't have any pizza sauce and it was great! I let it simmer for about 7 minutes to thicken it up so I ended up having to double the recipe for 2 pizzas. No problem, I just made a huge batch and froze it into ziplocs. Thanks!

Don't take my 4 as bad, but I changed a few things.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.  This is so easy and had great taste.  I did add a little tomato paste to thinken and some surger to cut back on the acidity.  If you are looking for something really easy with great taste, this is the recipe to use.

good flavor, a little spicy though, could cut back a little on the seasonings.  Also added about 1 TBL of tomato paste to thicken.  I have made it without the tomato paste and it a little runny.

Easy and then some...I do suggest a bit of tomato paste if you have it available. We use a concentrated brand that comes in a tube that looks like toothpaste (no joke), and it's reusable so there is no waste.

This is perfect for a quick dinner!  Taste great and fresh.  I also like it because I can hide veggies in the sauce.  Tonight I added tiny bits of red pepper and broccoli . . . my son's a bit picky . . . don't tell :)

I needed to make a pizza sauce with things I had on hand and this was perfect! So quick and easy, I will definitely make this again!

after adding 1/2 tsp sugar, some crushed red pepper, and 2 leaves of chopped fresh basil(on top of the dried basil), this is delicious. had everything on hand. so inexpensive and easy. i will never buy pizza sauce again. only used half of it and froze the rest for future pizza making. thanks so much for the base recipe.

I was surprised how good this was. I had to add more garlic and seasonings then it was a 5 star recipe, but just as is 4 stars.

This is quick and easy to throw together at any time you need a pizza sauce.  We also use this for dipping sauce breadsticks.

I can not 'create' anything without help.  This gave me a great start.  I just added 1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning and 2 teaspoons of brown sugar (we like it a little sweet) and it was great.  Thanks for the great begining.

Sorry, I made this on two seperate pizzas and it was unappealing. It wasn't the pizzas or toppings, because I used another pizza sauce as well on other pizzas with the same ingredients and the other sauce made it taste great.  This was easy, but not worth it.

Excellent easy recipe. I made this sauce in the morning and let the ingredients blend the whole day. I will definitely use this again!

Good sauce! I personally don’t like the taste of slow cooked, thickened pizza sauce. I like sauce that’s light and slightly seasoned, and this is it! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is too simple and too good to be true!
I made it tonight along with a pizza crust recipe, and loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing this!
