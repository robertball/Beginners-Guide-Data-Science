This last spring I went to a potluck that had this potato salad and it is far better than it sounds.  The only variation was that the other cook's version included chopped black olives, diced tomatoes and finely minced basil.  She said that sometimes she uses cilantro instead of basil and once even used minced capers (just a few) and even that was a slamming success.  You are in for a big surprise with this potato salad =]

This is a terrific recipe. Every time I've made this, I've gotten bigger then HUGE red potatoes that I should half and then slice. Something about the cottage cheese and the mayo make this recipe just stand out...it's creamy-goodness. The only thing my kids don't like, its the skins. However, they all love this recipe very much. Other then the skins...I haven't changed the recipe not one bit. Love the flavor, love the creamy-ness and love the fact that it's really easy to put together. It's worth trying. Ty and also another note...I only use Helliman's mayo...ONLY.

Brought me back to my childhood- Now I know how mom and nana made their potato salad! I halved the recipe, but used 4 medium potatoes. We found this to be a little too "dressed" despite the additional potato, and so will reduce the mayo & cottage cheese the next time we make it. I can't thank you enough for this recipe!

brought this salad to the 4th of july get together before trying it out, honestly the look of the cottage chhese in the salad was a turn off.  Liked the scallions and red potatoes but will never make this again.

Increased amount of potAtoes and used russet potatoes. Decreased amount of mayo and cottage cheese and it was still creamy enough. My husband couldn't believe it wasn't store bought. I think next time I will add celery and maybe radishe for color and crunch

This is the go to potato salad for me from now on.  I used to eat at a hot dog stand that offered potato salad as a side dish and I LOVED that salad.  Now I have found it again and will never go back to any other potato salad.  Take my word for it this is great...add other stuff if need be as I do..celery..onions...olives but keep this in your go too box.

This was excellent. I cant stop eating it. I didnt read the directions fully so I ended up mixing the mayo, onions, and cottage cheese in a bowl. Then I tossed in the potatoes. Still amazing. This is my "go to" recipe from now one.

It tasted a whole lot better on the third day. I enjoyed it then, however my family were turned off by the appearance and weren`t thrilled with the cottage cheese

It was a little bland. I made this along with a soup and another salad. The other salad had too much punch, while this one could have just a bit more. My mom suggested that I should add olives and a few other things, I'll have to ask, then I'll list it.
The olives will add some salt so that the salad has a bit more flavor other than the mayo and cheese, which sort of blended together.

This is the best potato salad ever!! I used russet potatoes cause that's all I had and peeled them, boiled and put them in the fridge for a couple hours, then prepared them as directed but added salt with each layer. I used white pepper instead cause that was all I had. Everybody loved it!! Making it again today using golden potatoes. The cottage cheese is just so creamy!

My cousin brought this to our family reunion and it was a big hit. Easy to make and a nice change from the standard potato salad recipe.

This recipe is fantastic. Only change I made was to add 3 hard boiled eggs. Will only use this recipe in the future, it's that good. I agree on the Hellmans (Best Foods)....it is required for the right taste.
