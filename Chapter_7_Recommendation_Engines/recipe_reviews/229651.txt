This one's tough to rate because it's hard to drink a Mojito and taste tequila.  It's just...weird.  However, weird is NOT bad.  If you are a tequila fan, this is definately a drink for you.  I used bottled lime juice in place of fresh lime and Diet 7up in lieu of club soda.  This is a nice cocktail.  CHEERS, dudelander!

Classic Mojito, very refreshing. You can use 7-up too instead of club soda. But this is the classic. Love it!

Good recipe but I added 1-2tbsp of lime juice with lime slices.  I fill glass full of ice, and instead of soda water I substituted club soda for 7 Up pop or Sprite.  Even my fussy wife liked it and she hardly drinks.

I was actually looking for the classic mojito recipe and found this and thought I’d try it since I had Patron on hand.  It’s a frizzy minty margarita and very good!  Very refreshing!  Will definitely make again! Cheers!!
