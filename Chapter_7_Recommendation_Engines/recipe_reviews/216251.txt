Not bad..I added a little bit more Balsamic Vinegar, just cause I love that taste and it came out really good, gave the sauce more of a kick! All in all, very good recipe!

What a TASTY DISH!!!!  I made it according to the directions but I couldn't find the Veggie Smart sauce.  I used the Chunky Garden Tomatoe Garlic and Onion by Prego.  It was DELICIOUS.  The "Only" change I intend to make the next time is to use thin sliced chicken breast.

I made this recipe for the family.  I felt that the chicken needed some flavor so I sprinkled salt, pepper, and garlic powder on before placing in the pan.  I used Bertolli tomato and basil sauce and reduced the basil to 1 tblsp.  It turned out very well.  The balsamic does add a great flavor.  The family liked it and I would definitely make this again.

The recipe was a great starting point. I then read the reviews and added those pointers, as well. So, I used 3 tbs of Balsamic vinegar, Chunky Garden Prego and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and Garlic powder. The pickiest eater in my house asked for seconds. Enough said. :)

My family loved this! My little boy is almost 2 and most of the dishes he likes are chicken nuggets or corn dogs so when he ate all on his plate  I knew I had a winner. Also asking my dad over for dinner and this is the disn I am going to make . I did use my own spin I used the chunky garden pasta sauce and I added alittle more vinger and I put a few dashes of italian seasoning and also used alittle bit of shredded mozzarella when I was getting ready to serve. My husband is a chesse eater. He is alsovery picky and he praised me for days after I made this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys pasta!

Made this recipe tonight and it is a keeper. Added chopped onion saut√©ed in a skillet before adding the sauce, and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning before cooking. Otherwise, it was great as written.  Will definitely make this again!
