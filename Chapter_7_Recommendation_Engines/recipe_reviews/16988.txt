I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It is awesome to say the least.  Better than any store bought.  I made it for my mom for t-day, and she fell in love.  The recipe calls to use an 8 inch dish, but that's not right.  The first time I made this, I used a 9 inch deep dish, and it worked beautifully. The second time, I used a regular 9 inch plate, and it overflowed just a bit, so go with the 9" deep dish.  The only thing I changed was to use cinnamon instead of nutmeg, because that was all I had.  One thing worth mentioning... After the initial 15 min. bake time, you really have to put foil around the edge of crust.  Also, about 10 min. before it was done, I thought it was getting too brown, so I layed a large piece of foil loosely over the pie.  It worked perfectly!!!  Thank you so much for the recipe.

It's very important to use the real ingredients here--especially the butter on top.  It helps the pie thicken & brown appropriately.  This is the perfect sugar cream pie recipe, but it is important to remember that recipes like this can be influenced by weather and other factors.  So, if it doesn't look thick at the end of the baking time, turn down the heat, leave it in the oven a bit longer, and keep a close eye on it so that it thickens up or you'll just have goo.

My eight year old daughter made this pie!  It's that easy.  The end product didn't look like any sugar cream pie I've ever seen but it definately tasted like one.  We'll be trying this one again.

My family loves this recipe.  It's the ultimate comfort food.  Bake it until all of the pie is set except for a silver dollar size area in the center.  It usually takes a bit longer in my oven than the recipe states.

I won't spoil the rating, but this didn't work for me. Didn't set up like I was hoping & it just wasn't what I was envisioning. Top of pie looked weird, too.

I grew up in Indiana but have been gone for 20+ years only returning less than I should have.  Ever since experiencing a Wickes sugar cream pie in my youth, I thought it the best pie in the world.  Never thought about cooking one myself for fear it would not turn out right and would be dissapointed.  I have just cooked this pie and it was the easiest thing I have ever cooked.  This also taste just as good as the childhood memory of a wickes pie.

Excellent pie. It came out of the oven smelling wonderful and tasted just as good. My father would call this poor man's pie, because his mother would make it during the depression when no other filling was available!!!

i love sugar cream pies.. but apparently this pie didn't have the "creamy" look. it tasted good, but i didn't like the texture... i was hoping for a creamy, milky look... but i guess it just wasn't there. it looked more like "milk gelatin" and "clear"

If I could give this 25 stars, I would.  I've been grain and sugar free all week, and I chose this pie to break my "fast," and celebrate this weekend.  Rich and creamy, silky and buttery, it is worth every.single.calorie. of the 541 per serving.  Be SURE to use real, high-quality vanilla, real butter (salted gives it the perfect touch), and best, grate fresh nutmeg over the top.  Absolutely divine - THANK YOU, Glenda, for sharing!

So easy and very good.  I have tried other sugar cream pie recipes and this one was by far the easiest and the taste is wonderful!  My husband has asked me to make it twice in the last week.

Absolutely perfect! Would not change a thing. This is meant to be served in small slices, as it is very sweet. Our guests devoured this before some of the other pies were even touched!

I had never tried making a Sugar Cream pie before, so this was my maiden voyage, so to speak. So, to be safe, I followed the recipe to the letter, and wow, I was so excited when it came out of the oven perfect!! This was a delicious recipe and I will definitely make it again.

Really good recipe, very easy.  Don't be afraid if the top looks like it is getting too done - once it comes out and cools it looks perfect. Make sure you cook long enough or the middle may have a slight raw flour taste.  Overall a good recipe, thanks for sharing :0)

I took this pie to my in-laws for Christmas this year, and my brother-in-law the sugar cream pie fanatic flipped over it.

I would second the motion to give this one ten stars.

I have had this recipe at a friends house so I gave it a try. It overflowed in my oven - terrible smell and smoke. It never fully set up and had a clear liquid. If anyone has a suggestion, I will try it again. I do like this pie and will keep the recipe, even though my first go at it wasn't a success.

Love this pie! Used a deep dish pie crust (and had no problems with overflowing) and sprinkled the top with nutmeg and cinnamon. The butter on top makes it crispy - don't skip that step. We love sugar cream pie and this homemade version was terrific!

Made this pie for my husband.  His mom makes a really good sugar cream pie.  Decided to try and out do her.  He loved it.  He took one of the pies to work to share.  He has never done that before.  Only thing he said was it had a little to much flour that made it a little thick.  Thank you.

I love sugar cream pie.  This was the first one I ever attempted to make myself.  The texture wasn't right and it tasted floury.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It just didn't turn out right.

Everytime I make this I get tons of compliments.  I live near a resturant that is famous for their sugar cream pies, but when I bring this pie, the bought pie does not stand a chance!  I love how easy it is to throw together.

Although this is a good "Cream" pie, it's not quite like the Indiana sugar cream pie I was looking for. The Wicks company in Indiana makes a sugar cream pie that doesn't have all of the cream this one has. I'll keep looking.

Had to try this after a friend ranted and raved about it. It was easy enough to make, it set up fine. I didn't have to put foil on it. I used a graham cracker crust though because I don't like pastry pie crust.

I made this as a birthday surprise for my daughter's boss. He said he hadn't been able to find a decent sugar cream pie since his grandmother passed away and his office staff wanted to do something special for him. The report I got back was that this pie "was every bit as good as Grandma ever made", and another co-worker who was a former restaurant owner said that pie was "high quality restaurant" level. I made no changes to the recipe, and will definitely make this again!

I was very excited to try this recipe since I grew up in Indiana and haven't had Sugar Cream Pie since I left.  I followed this recipe    exactly and for some reason it did not set and is just a pool of liquid.  Not sure what went wrong.

This is such a nostalgic recipe for me.  It took me right back to the days of being a little girl in Indiana.

I have tried several Sugar Cream Pie recipes before but could never get it to set and this one was perfect!

Each time I make this.  I am the favorite of any party or gathering.  I am still getting requests from friends we haven't seen in year's. 

So easy to make. And so delicious.

I absolutely love this pie! My aunt made a sugar cream pie and I have tried several over the years-always a disappointment. This pie is exactly right! I don’t know why I didn’t think of baking one myself before. I was afraid it would be too hard. I’m so glad I tried this recipe! It’s delicious and a perfect match to my childhood memory.

I had been looking for another recipe.  I was glad I found this one but did change it up a bit.  I wish I could submit a picture.  I dotted the pie like the recipe said and it left butter spots all over.  It was funny looking like another reviewer said.  That being said, it was very very delicious.  Baked just like it said and came out perfect.  I am rating it 4/5 because even with the changes ie using some brown sugar etc, it wouldn't have changed the butter spots.  I will melt the butter next time and just add it to the mixture.

I made this pie after my boyfriend showed me one online for $49!!!  I love to bake and have made things for him after he has showed interest in purchasing things online.  When he came home, the pie had been out of the oven for 1 hour and was still warm.  I made the pie exactly as written.  It was not firm and he stuck a fork in it to taste and was concerned about the consistency of it.  We put it in the refrigerator for 2 hours and then sampled it...still slightly runny but the taste was great.  Back in the refrigerator it went and after another hour, it was firm and sliced nicely.

Most Awesome EVER!! worth 10 stars!  even better than Mrs. Wickes pies- followed recipe except added 1 1/4 C. heavy cream and 1/2 C. milk. Perfect!
2nd review: I only had half and half- no whipping cream so this time I made it with 1 3/4 C. half and half. I baked at 450 for 15 minutes then 350 for 45 minutes, but after that I needed to bake it a total of 30 minutes longer- reducing the heat down to 325 for the first 10 minutes and then 300 for the last 20 minutes. There was still a section the size of a large pancake that was jiggly, but I hoped for the best- took it out and chilled it overnight. Just had a piece- it all set up and the taste is still 10 stars!! Just took 1 1/2 hours total to bake it this time- (with foil covering the crust most all of the bake time).

I made this for my dad's birthday because sugar cream pie is his favorite. He said that this was the best sugar cream pie he had ever had! My family all really loved it too. It was too good to make only one pie and the next time I made it, I made three.

My dad loves sugar cream pie, and I make him one every year during the holidays.  I used to use my grandma's recipe, but this year I tried this one.  My dad said it was best sugar cream pie he's ever eaten.  My husband never liked this kind of pie, but even he loved this one.  It disappeared so fast I was told that I need to make one for christmas.  I made it just as written, no variations.

My husbands favorite pie!!  One tip I do have if it hasn't been mentioned before: bake it on a cookie sheet to catch any overflows. I use a deep dish 9 inch pie crust and sometimes still have it full to the top.

This was my first sugar cream pie to taste or bake. I will def make it again. The cooking time was spot on for me. The center of the pie didn't look fully set but I was confident and took it out of the oven anyway. After cooling completely it was perfectly set. My only change was to use part brown sugar but that was simply because I was out of white sugar. Thanks for a great foolproof pie recipe Ms. Browning.

I'd never had Sugar Cream Pie, but a friend loves it and said this was just like the pie from the bakery in her hometown.  (Me personally, I thought it was kind of bland and needed cinnamon or fruit or something, but I don't know what it's supposed to be like.)

This was an easy and excelent recipe.  My family said it was "the best sugar cream pie they had ever had".  My husband added, "and I have had a lot of pies."  I doubt I ever try another sugar cream pie recipe.  I wondered if the nutmeg would be to overpowering or to strong, but it was perfect.  It added such a wonderful flavor.
