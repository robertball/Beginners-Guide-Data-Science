I prefer to use unprocessed foods, so I used 6 fresh eggs in place of the 1 1/2 cups of egg substitute.  Also, because my apples were large, I only used two Granny Smiths, and Iâ€™m glad I did because they do exude a lot of liquid which does not get absorbed into the bread.  My baking time was a little longer but that may be because of my oven.  The end result was a tasty breakfast.

Ok------I was lazy and really did not want to peel and core apples, this recipe looked so good I had to try it but I put my spin on it.  I used a can of com stock apple pie filling, because it's already sweet I only used a tablespoon of brown sugar, I put the apple pie filling, pecans, dried cranberrys, and butter in a bowl and mixed them, then I poured this into the prepared 13x9 pan.  I never have egg substitute on hand so I used another reviewers suggestion and used 6 large eggs, milk and cinnamon. Mixed eggs with other ingredients and poured it over day old Italian bread that I bought and put in fridge to "dry" out a bit, then I followed the directions as written.  This is beyond good !! I love that you make it a head of time and let it sit over night, with my family's busy schedule it was a nice treat for my husband to wake up to the great smell of this French toast bake.  Thank you for sharing !!!!!

Made a few tweaks...used Almond Milk instead of milk.  Used Earth Balance spread instead of butter.  Used 1/4 cup less sugar.  Delicious!  Made this for Easter brunch, big hit!  Will definitely make this again.

If you like bread pudding then this recipe is for you.  There is nothing french toast about this recipe and the name should be Baked Cinnamon Apple bread pudding.  My family does not like bread pudding and I will not be making this again.

This is a good starting recipe, but I think could use some revisions to make it fantastic!  I used 6 real eggs in place of egg substitute, otherwise I made this exactly as written.  Next time, I would increase the pecans to a full cup - I didn't really get as much of the flavor or crunch that I wanted with a half cup.  I also recommend making the night before, and flipping the bread once several hours before you plan to cook.  This helps make sure the liquid component is fully absorbed.  I had some sections of bread that were completely untouched by the egg mixture when I didn't flip.  Lastly, I will plan to add some sort of simple brown sugar syrup over the top of the dish next time.  As is, my husband still wanted maple syrup on top.

Delicious recipe just as written, although I changed a few things to make it dairy free due to allergies, and to use fresh eggs. Used almond milk, dairy-free "butter," and 6 eggs, otherwise everything just as written, and it was scrumptious! Assembled the night before and served with scrambled eggs, bacon and fresh fruit for a complete and easy brunch for guests.

...  Also, I found the bread a bit soggy after having it sit for 5 mins.  It was less soggy after about 15mins, but it wasn't as warm.  Next time, I will make the french toast the traditional way using this egg/milk mixture from this recipe, make the fruit/nut topping separately and just scoop it onto the made french toast.

I followed the suggestions to use fresh eggs instead of an egg substitute, and I used 8 eggs instead of 6 to make sure all the bread was covered. It worked beautifully. I also used only two large Granny Smith apples. This was a Christmas morning hit with my family!

I made this with cubed stale ciabatta bread rolls, and it turned out great! Had to add extra milk to cover the bread and baked for about an hour. I'll definitely make this again! So easy.

My family loves this recipe!!  I did use 6 fresh eggs rather than egg substitute.  I also omitted nuts and cranberries.  Definitely a keeper!

I used sliced sourdough and I cut it into squares to fit more bread in. I think I'll use 1/4 less sugar and a touch less butter as well. I also used 6 eggs, and whole milk. It was delicious and filling! I might add a pinch of nutmeg and ginger to give it more spice. My husband loved it. My picky 5 year old didn't like the nuts, so I'll make a little section without nuts next time- something to keep in mind if you have super picky guests.

Not exactly French Toast but no complaints either. Looks presentable flipped over on a serving platter. I mixed first ingredients in a warm pot on the stove to mix well and then added it to the sprayed pan to preserve the non-stick benefits.

Made it for Christmas morning, using cinnamon bread with no raisins because some of my family doesn't like raisins.  I would make it for me and my husband with raisin bread.  It was a special breakfast.

Delicious recipe - easy and quick. I doubled the recipe and used real eggs. I baked the apple topping and French toast in separate dishes, as suggested by one reviewer, which made it easy to give everyone just the right amount of topping to suit their tastes. My family (3 generations) devoured it and asked me to make it again soon. We used leftover bread from
