This is always a hit!  Tips I live by to make this turn out every time.  1) DON'T bake the pretzel layer any longer than 10 minutes.  2) Double the amount of jello to make it proportional to the amount of cream cheese.  3) Let the jello chill to thicken slightly before spreading on the cream cheese layer.

I have made this a few times now with perfect results.  I read the reviews prior to making it and found it extremely helpful to do the following: 1) instead of using 2 cups of water, use 1 cup of boiling water to dissolve the package of gelatin, then add 3/4 cup strawberry juice/syrup, and then add the strawberries; and 2)put the gelatin/strawberry mixture in the fridge for about an hour or so to thicken a bit before pouring it overtop of the cream cheese mixture (this is very key for the success of the dessert).  I really think these changes helped to enhance the texture and flavor of the gelatin layer.  I highly recommend trying this.  I have taken it to two dinner parties now and cannot tell you how many compliments I received, my friends were thoroughly impressed.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!!

This was really good! I added some vanilla (1/2 tsp) to the cream cheese layer. I also think the crust should be a bit sweeter- I will try it with white and brown sugar next time. As other readers have warned, this crust will turn to CEMENT if you cook it too long. Take it out after 10 minutes even if you don't think it's cooked. It will get hard as it sits! Roll the side of a drinking glass over the crust in the pan- it makes an easy job of pressing it in.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe that has been around for years.  If it was not offered during my family's Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday they would protest in rebellion!  Only recommendation I would make is to use butter gold pretzels as this enhances the flavor.  PLEASE NOTE:  This is NOT a recipe that keeps for days...  it needs to be eaten within the first 48 hours as the pretzel crust breaks down and softens and it just does not do it justice - Hands down to the crunch in this salad, it's a winner.

I have been making this for at least 15 years and everyone fights over it. They want to get their share. My recipe differs a little. It calls for 2 cups pretzels, marg. instead of butter and 3 tsp.( I use heaping tsps.) sug. for crust. For cheese middle it is the same only it calls for 1- 8 oz cream cheese instead of 2. Top layer is 2 small pkgs. jello,water the same,but use 2-10 oz. cartons frozen strawberries. I like Birdseye brand in syrup. If berries are whole, I chop them up. It really needs to chill several hours. This is my most requested jello recipe ever! It really is like a dessert!  When I first made it, no one could figure out what the bottom was made of! You really must try. Thanks Tom!

Delicious!  This a a great dessert!  Two suggestions: 1) do not bake the crust any longer than the 10 minutes called for, even if you are adding extra pretzels, butter and sugar to the crust.  If the butter/sugar mixture gets too hot it will turn to cement and a chisel will be required for removing it from the dish- I found out the hard way and 2) when choosing your strawberries take note of the amount of juice they are sitting in and reduce the two cups of water by that amount.  Enjoy!

I've made this several times for work potlucks. I would make it the night before and it always turned out beautifully (it's a big hit!). Once I made it during an afternoon for dinner that night and the pretzel crust was much too hard. I think the trick is letting it sit overnight long enough for the crust to soften. It's definitely my favorite!

This was indeed quite good. I made it precisely as the directions say, including all frozen strawberries, juice and a full 2 cups of water, and the jello was perfect. I ONLY baked for 10 minutes as everyone suggested and I did let the jello/strawberries sit for an hour in the frig first. Even then they still seemed to pour onto the cream cheese layer fairly liquidy so I worried that it wouldn't gel but it did set up perfectly. The jello did not seep into the cream cheese. The pretzel crust certainly does get more mushy the longer it's in your frig after making so if you can eat all of this in 1-3 days, that's preferable.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was one of the first dishes to go.  The only change I made was I used frozen sliced strawberries (2 tubs) so the strawberry chunks weren't so big.

Enjoyed by all.  I used butter flavor pretzels.  No one guessed it was a pretzel layer.  I used fresh strawberries and made the jello as I was beginning the recipe.  I then refrigerated and, by the time it came to do the jello layer, the jello had thickened enough for the strawberries to be folded in.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this!  Baked my crust a little longer so it would be good and crispy.  The first time I made this, I didn't take the time to let the gelatin/strawberry mixture partially "gel" and it ran into the pretzels and made them soggy almost immediately.  Second time, I let it "gel" a bit and it turned out picture perfectly.  The crust was still crunchy on the 2nd day...not so good on the 3rd...but still.  A great recipe!

A Yummy Dessert! Here are few tips for a crunchy pretzel crust.. 1st, make sure you allow the pretzel crust to cool completely after baking. 2nd, make sure your cream cheese/cool whip layer is thick enough! I actually like to make 1&1/2 the amt or even double this portion of the recipe since it is the barrier between the pretzel& jello layers. Also, when you are spreading the cream cheese mixture over the pretzel layer make sure you get it all the way to the sides of the dish(all the way around)so that when you add the jello layer, there is no chance that the jello can leak down the sides of the dish& get to the pretzels. Once the cream cheese layer is on, refrigerate those 2 layers for about 30 min. This way the cream cheese layer is cold& more firm.  Meanwhile, in a bowl put together the jello mixture according to the directions& place it into the fridge as well for about 20 minutes to help it set up before adding it to the top of the cream cheese layer. I usually  check the jello mixture half way through it's time in the fridge&give it a good stir to see how it is doing& to mix it all up again. Once it is set up but is still able to be easily stirred, it's ready to go on top of the ream cheese layer.. After it is all put together, refrigerate for the recommended time& enjoy! I also found that it is best to eat this on the same day it is made...it never tastes the same the next day in my opinion...

Our family has been making strawberry pretzel dessert for at least 25 years.  Even though it's called a salad, we always serve it as dessert.  A couple suggestions that might help with the crust...  I only use Rold Gold twist pretzels. I've tried other shapes, and other brands, and Rold Gold twists are the best for this.  Do not pulverize the pretzels.  In fact, I do not use the fine powder stuff in my recipe.  Crush the pretzels until they resemble chunky nuts.  Crush them just enough that they do not resemble pretzels anymore.  I put my pretzels into a large ziplock, and hit/grind them with a soup can.  Then I measure out the larger pieces for my recipe, and leave the powdery/salty bits out.  If a few large pieces remain - you can crush them in the pan to break them down a bit.  Also, my recipe calls for 2 cup of pretzels, 1 cup of butter and no sugar.  With the other layers being so sweet, I don't think the crust needs sugar.  Whether you serve it as a salad or a dessert, this is a delicious recipe!

This is delish!  I used fresh strawberries because I don't care for the texture of defrosted frozen strawberries.  I prepared mine in a spring-form pan and it made a beautiful presentation on my pink cake plate.  LOVE this recipe!!

I have made this three times and given out the recipe twice. Everyone likes it! Make sure to follow the three "golden rules" for making it: 1)do not bake crust for more than 10 minutes, 2) Spread the cream cheese mixture all the way to the edges to "seal" out the jello, 3) Chill cream cheese layer throughly  and jello layer slightly before pouring the jello over the rest so that you don't have marbeling.

The freezer is your friend with this recipe. It makes this recipe fast and fool proof. I read most of the top reviews for this recipe and incorporated the best advice to knock this out of the park. 1st, I used two cups of crushed pretzels but didn't crush them down to total dust -- mostly just little nubby bits. Put 4tbspns sugar & 2 tbspns brown. Used Parkay instead of butter. Spread evenly in a 9x13 (was hard but I worked at it and got it done). Baked for only 8 minutes and let it rest on the counter until cooled. PERFECTION. Next I added vanilla to the cream cheese layer and popped it in the freezer for about 30 minutes. I made sure my cream cheese was spread to the edges and in the corners to seal the crust in. I followed another revewer's suggestion to use one cup boiling water and one cup strawberry juice (drained from tub of strawberries). I didn't get quite a full cup of juice from the first 10oz tub so I filled remaining 1/4 cup with with boiling water. Then I dumped in all of TWO 10oz tubs frozen strawberries. I put the mixture into the freezer for about 40 minutes until it was setting up but still fluid. I spread that onto the cream cheese layer (which was resting in the fridge) and put all of it back in the freezer for about 20 minutes at which point it was DONE. Not a drop of red bled into my cream cheese layer or crust. It was a thing of beauty. Crust was nice and chewy/crisp. Just as good next day too. Guests devoured so I'm making again this week for just us!

This was out of this world! I received many compliments...especially about the crust :) I did change a few things: 1) I used about 2 cups of pretzels since I was using a 10" spring form pan. 2) I added a few splashes of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. 3) I let the jello/strawberry mix set for about 45 min. 4) I baked the crust for about 8 1/2 min. and it was perfect. 5) Made sure I "sealed" the crust using the cc mix. I didn't want to pretzels getting soggy.

Things I learned: 1) Not to use a spring form pan again. Too messy! If I do, I will half the jello mixture. 9x13 glass baking dish would be ideal b/c the colors are so pretty! 2) I plan on trying lower fat/sugar versions of all the ingredients next time. Well, maybe not the cream cheese ;)

This isn't usually my kind of dessert but I was surprised by how good it was.  And honestly to all of you people complaining about the nutrition facts, just alter the recipe or be quiet!  You're acting like you're going to eat this 3 times a day, every day.  There's a thing called moderation, you know?  Sheesh!

This recipe makes the perfect pretzel salad.  Word of caution: if you have thoughts of completely crushing the pretzels into crumbs, don't do it!  I stuck the pretzels in the food processor once and the result just wasn't the same.  Chunks of pretzels work best for this dessert!

This tasted great!!! However, for those inexperienced bakers such as myself, please remember to grease your pan or the pretzel mix will stick.  But nevertheless it's a perfect treat...the combination of salty and sweet was delicious.  I didn't add the strawberries, only the strawberry Jello...still scrumptious!

I've been using this recipe or variations of it for years.  Got even bigger kudos when using one 3-oz wild strawberry jello mixed with one black cherry.  The black cherry really gives it depth.  Sticking with frozen strawberries as the mixed blend tends to be mushy with the raspberries in it.  Always a hit!!

Yum! This is one of my favorite salads. Growing up, my grandma made this for every family get-together. I loved it then and still do! Because I was taking this to my in-laws, I made a diabetic-friendly version (my MIL is diabetic). I substituted low-fat / fat-free dairy products, used sugar-free Jell-O, a single package of cream cheese and a T less sugar in my pretzel layer. I also substituted half Splenda for regular sugar in my cream cheese layer. I used a large can of crushed (drained) pineapple AND 20 oz. of strawberries for my gelatin layer. Instead of adding 2 c. boiling water to my gelatin, I boiled a 1/2 c. of my reserved pineapple juice and then added enough reserved strawberry juice to equal 2 c. (I add water if necessary). Being that I've been eating and making this since I was a child, I do have a couple of tips to help ensure a great outcome. First and foremost, DO NOT overbake your crust! Set your oven no hotter than 350 degrees and bake for no more than 10 min. (until golden). Your crust might not seem set, but it will once it cools. Second, only slightly crush your pretzels (sm. chunks work best). Finally, there's no need for your gelatin to set up before adding the fruit (I've never had issues with my gelatin "seeping" into my cream cheese layer). Thanks for sharing, Tom! This IS the BEST EVER!!! :-)

Excellent!  I used Raspberries rather than strawberries.. have had this both ways.. Raspberries are a bigger hit..I also ADDED approx 1/2 box More jello to the 2 Cups boiling water.. then of course used frozen raspberries.. Also..be careful not to bake crust too long or the pretzel crust will be too hard.. Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This is always a hit.  I don't think the pretzel layer is thick enough so I doubled mine and it was perfect.  The hints on here are accurate about not baking longer than 10 min and making sure each layer has chilled for a bit and letting the jello thicken just a tad in the fridge before adding.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make this again!

I use 2.5 cups of pretzels instead of the 1.5. People love this yummy salad! Always a hit when I bring it.

This was such a different and great recipe.  What a suprise with all the different kinds of ingredients.
For the crust I did 2 sticks melted butter, 1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp sugar, and 3 cups crushed pretzel to make it one and a half the desired amount.  I like a thicker crust. Did spray the pan with Pam and baked 10 minutes and it was perfect.  The only other thing I did different was to use fresh strawberries for which I covered the cream cheese/cool whip layer with and poured the gelatin over them.  I did let the gelatin set in the fridge for a half hour before pouring over the strawberries.  People did want the recipe.  I love suprise recipes that are fabulous!!

5 star IF you follow these tips. The whipped cream and cream cheese layer HAS to be refridgerated for at least a half hour/hour b4 you pour on the jello...otherwise the white stuff will bubble up and the jello wont harden right. ALSO, make sure you use hard small thin pretzels. I tried making this with a little bit thicker pretzel and it ended up soggy for the final product. If you follow those tips, you should be alright.

Everyone raved about this dish! I used an additional 1/2 cup of crushed pretzels for the crust. Also used cherry jello and a 16 oz bag of "Very Berry Cherry" frozen mixed fruit from Trader Joe's. I like the smaller fruit so that is spreads out more evenly in the jello. I think I would also like this with a fruit compote on top.

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because the recipe, as stated, is way too much like a dessert and not really a side dish at all. In addition, it's super unhealthy and loaded with sugar. However, I have made this 4 times now tweaking it each time and I think I've finally figured out how to make a HEALTHY version! Here's what I do: 1) I cut the sugar down by 1/2 in the crust - you won't even notice it's gone 2) I use 1/3 fat cream cheese (often called Neufchatel)- don't use fat free, that stuff is gross! 3) instead of whipped topping, I use 8 oz. Chobani or Fage plain Greek yogurt - no sugar and adds protein while still keeping it thick and creamy 4) I use 1/2 the sugar in the cream cheese mixture as well - it's plenty sweet but more creamy 5) Lastly, I buy Knox gelatin and mix 3/4 package raspberry Jello with a single 1 oz Knox gelatin- this effectively "cuts" the sugar while still keeping the nice gelatin consistency. The end result is still amazingly delicious and WAY more healthy!

I've made this wonderful salad for years, recently our granddaughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.  I've changed several things in this recipe to allow her to have a nice big portion.  It took some experimenting but I now use Splenda in place of the sugar, sugar-free jello, lowfat cream cheese, lowfat Cool Whip and fresh strawberries or frozen w/o syrup. I add a little lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture and 1/2 teaspoon almond flavoring to the strawberries. This is such a good recipe, even with all the changes to accomodate our granddaughter, no one knew the difference and scarfed it down just like always.  It makes me so happy to make her favorite dish because it's the one she has always asked for on holidays and get-togethers.

I followed the advice of many who have gone before me.  I broke the pretzel pieces by hand.  a roller would pulverize them.  They were approx 1/4" pieces.  I used slightly more butter than called for and it was a cinch to remove from the pan.  I kept the mixture in the oven for 7 minutes since my oven runs hot and it does not have a setting. I used a square All-Clad pan and later I transferred it to a Sterlite plastic dish w/ an airtight cover and froze some squares.  We are not going to eat that much butter & cream cheese in (1) week.  We used frozen sliced strawberries from Walmart.  They were not preserved in that sweet sticky cornsyrup.  I folded the cool whip into the cream cheese.   I sat the cream cheese out on the counter until it had the consistency of soft butter.  I mixed it in a 4 QT OXO bowl.  I love this bowl for everything.  I put the Jello mixture into the refrigerator for approx 15 minutes to thicken it before pouring it over the cream cheese.  I let the cream cheese mixture sit in the refrigerator overnight b/c I am a busy nurse who works 12 hr shifts and I make recipes late at night.  I used 1 C boiling water and added the water from the strawberries and then added an additional quantity of hot water to equal another full cup.  The Jello was thickening as I stirred so I new it could not sit in the refrigerator for an hour.  My mother does not like the thicker texture of Jello.  It does come out kinda rubbery, but it is ok for us.  It was so pretty and tasty

I gave this 3 stars just on the remote chance that I did something wrong.  We thought that this was horrible.  The prezel crust was soggy, and the jello mixture seeped through the cream cheese mixture and the frozen strawberrys were a big mistake.  I just don't understand what could have gone wrong.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  I will not be making this one again. (Please look at my other reviews, I have only given one other negative review)

OHHH this is yummy! It tastes like a light, fluffy, strawberry cheesecake. Everyone loved this. My brother in law said after one bite, "OH this is so good!" The only thing I will do differently when I make it again is smash the pretzels with a rolling pin so they are more pulverized, but NOT smash it so hard into the pan when making the crust. If you press too hard, you have a crust made of concrete. It was still YUMMY!

I used fresh strawberries, so for the jello, I added 3/4 the amount of water the box called for. I also placed dessert in freezer to help set before pouring jello ofer strawberries. I also placed jello mix in bowl in freezer fro 20 mins to thicken up before spreading/pouring over strawberries, then placed back in freezer for 15 mins, then in fridge for an hour before serving.
Jello set perfectly on fresh strawberries & looked like a gorgeous glaze!

Great recipe! I did use brown sugar instead of white sugar... and it came out great! I found if you use the frozen strawberries right out of the freezer, they are too solid. I actually microwaved mine to soften them up just a bit. I think next time I will leave the strawberries on the counter a little while before I am actually going to use them.  Another tip is to make sure to "seal" the edges when you put the cream cheese mixture in. Otherwise the liquid jello will seep into the pretzels and make them soggy! I will make this again.

This was a huge hit @ our 4th of July party... Due to dietary issues I used sugar free jello and cool whip. I cut the amount of sugar in the filling considerably I used 1/4 of a cup of sugar and 1/4 of a cup of splenda...I also used splenda and sugar mixture for the crust. I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen due to being in season. It was absolutely delicious! Cant wait to make it again.

I LOVE this recipe! The first time I made it I took the suggestions of some other reviews to double the jello. Personally, I thought it was too much jello. I prefer this recipe as is. Also, I've used fresh strawberry's because it's what I had on hand at the time and it came out wonderfully. Just make sure that if you use the fresh strawberrys to follow the directions on the jello box and add the cold water. And definitely make sure the jello sets before pouring it on top...I made that mistake the first time and the jello soaked through the pretzels.

Initially, not a big fan of foods that you would find, in multiple variations, at a church supper... but something about this caught my eye... maybe it was the pretzels.  Followed the advice to adjust liquid in Jello based on liquid in the frozen strawberries.  Other than that, added a little vanilla extract to the cream cheese (low fat used) and sugar.  Also used low fat whipped topping.  I wish they had low fat butter, I would have used that too.  Regardless, everyone in the family was skeptical at first, but that changed quickly as they tried it.  This will be made again with the addition of fresh strawberries, if I can find some that look half way decent.  Yum delicious!!!!

Great stuff.  I did it as a July 4th dish and  made up some blueberry Jell-o as well.  I used some cardboard to section off a space for the  blueberry "stars" and poured the rest strawberry to make a flag.  If you wanted to take the time you could do stripes by pouring the strawberry into a same size pan lined with plastic wrap, cutting and piecing the stripes in and making stars with white choc chips.

The kids and I made this together for Father's Day. The only changes I made was to increase the crushed pretzels to two full cups and I used all reduced fat, sugar-free  or "light" products where I could. After I mixed the strawberries in, it didn't look like quite enough, so I added in another cup. Noone noticed that it was a lighter dessert and I didn't say anything. It was still as good as it would have been with it's full fat counterparts. I think I could cut back some of the sugar in the "cheesecake" part of this dessert by half next time. As is, we ate it and enjoyed it very much.

This dessert is a winner. I did make a few adjustments. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, whick made for a very tasty crust. I would advise using more pretzel ingredients if you like a thicker crust...I did. I also added a little vanilla to the cream cheese mixture and agave nectar instead of white sugar...delicious :)

Absolutely the hands down favorite at our house.  Couple of tips that others have mentioned-- 1. let the jello mixture thicken a little before you put it on top of the cream cheese.  It just works better. 2. DO NOT overbake the crust.  It WILL harden with a few minutes on the counter. 3. Make an extra one and hide it in the fridge so when this one disappears you can pull it out and have some yourself.  Super easy and so tasty.

STOP! and look no further for a strawberry pretzel dessert! This one is absolutely wonderful. The only change I made was the boiling water for the jello, I scaled back about 1/4 C...and I also let the jello/strawberry mixture set up for about 40 minutes.  Also make sure to 'seal' the cream cheese mixture to the pretzel crust to prevent any seeping. This recipe is super yum!

This recipe got rave reviews at my family gathering.  I made it as directed, however...instead of adding the frozen strawberries to the hot boiling jello, I let the jello cool for about 20 min before adding strawberries.  I was afraid the strawberries would get too mushy adding to the hot water.  I then added some more fresh sliced strawberries to give it more bulk.  Before adding the mixture over the cream layer, I let the jello, strawberrie mixture cool a little more, until it started to thicken.  Then I spooned it over the cream layer.  I did'nt want the warm strawberry mixture to melt into the cream layer.  It turn out beautiful.  Very Yummy recipe

This was pretty good.  I had to use a bit more crushed pretzels than called for because I had a little trouble spreading them out to cover the pan.  I let a few people try this and they enjoyed it as well.  Not sure if I'll make this again just because I'm not craving it.  I ate almost the whole thing and got kind of burned out on it..but it is good.  Thanks Tom.

I've made this several times and everyone is always amazed at how good it is. Be sure to completely cover the pretzel layer with the cream layer so that none of the liquified jello gets to the pretzels. That way the pretzels will stay crispy.

Follow the directions making sure you completely cover the crust with cream cheese mixture, and let the jello set a bit before pouring over top.  I used about 3 cups of fresh strawberries.

Excellent.  i have made this probably 8 times by now.  it works great.  definitely chill between layers.  i have also made it with Jello cook lemon pie filling instead of the strawberry layer.  not lemon jello.  just follow the box instructions.  i use the 2 cups pretzels, 3/4 c butter and 1/2 c brown sugar.  it is requested as a birthday cake!  thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this recipe for a family gathering but made it for the diabetics that were here. I used sugar free jello, sugar free cool whip, light cream cheese and splenda (instead of sugar). I was only expecting two people to eat it but it was gone before I knew it and the family was coming back for more. The second time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was great too. I will be making this one again.

I was a bit skeptical about trying this, but it was the most amazing desert. I got many compliments on it and it has become my new favorite recipe. I would recommend making it the night before, it seems the longer it sits the better it gets. I used 2 8x8 square pans and it worked out perfectly.

Oh, this is very good. I've actually made this with and without the gelatin topping, and when I omit the gelatin I like to spread a can of blueberry pie filling on top of the cream cheese mixture. I also think that sliced fresh fruit would be a good topper for this. The crust is wonderful as well, and everyone I make this for is always intrigued by the ingredients in the crust. I like to serve this as a light dessert. Great recipe, thanks so much!

Ok, I have no idea what happened.  I followed the recipe exactly and my jello fell to the bottom.  I did NOT have 3 pretty layers with my sald.  I looked ok...but I know that isn't how it is supposed to look.  With that being said....still DELICIOUS.  Thanks for the post. (no idea what I did wrong though)

I made this salad for a group of 40 people and it was a HUGE hit!  I doubled the recipe but would recommend using only 3 (8oz) packages of cream cheese.

this is sinful!  i think i will reduce the cream cheese as suggested (even though my boyfriend thinks it was fine) to only one pkg.  i used fresh strawberries and packed them on the top.  if possible, find pretzels with no salt.  next time i will use 1/2 with salt and the other without.  so easy to make and very delicious.

While this was a hit at the potluck the first time I made it, due to a time crunch the second time I used a can of pie filling on top in place of the jello/fruit mixture.  My husband & I preferred it with just the pie filling on top, but it is good either way.  I used a little less butter in the crust to avoid the overwhelming butter flavor.  Great recipe!

This one is SOOO good!  Be sure to use real sugar for the pretzel crust - I tried splenda for my diabetic relatives, and the crust didn't stick together when spreading the cream cheese.  The rest was great, though!

Love this for summertime treat! I used fresh strawberries and so let the jello sit too long before I mixed with the berries. Still tasted great though, thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  One of my favorites.  I used fresh strawberries and doubled the amount of Jello.  Make sure you spread the cream cheese layer all the way to the corners/edge of the pan or the jello mixture will seep down into the crust and get a little mushy.  It helps to refridgerate the crust and cream cheese layer over night, before adding the jello layer.

Made this as low calorie as possible (lite cream cheese, lite cool whip, sugar free jello, and 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup). It turned out awesome. and hubby was none the wiser ;) I also baked the crust for 10 minutes as many suggested and it worked great!

Have been making this for years my family loves it.  I use two boxes of jello and I use strawberry slices instead of whole strawberries. The secret to making it good is a crispy pretzel layer.

This is a amazing recipe! I doubled the gelatin so it was the same portion as the cream cheese filling. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to my cream cheese filling. It's makes it taste so much better you have to add vanilla.

Mine did not turn out so great but I am still giving it 4 stars because I have had this when someone else made it and it was really good.
My mistakes/changes: 
I added a little bit more pretzels because they didn't seem to cover my 9x13 dish. I should have crushed the pretzels much better. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. 
My beater isn't very good and I thought the cream cheese and sugar was well mixed but when I folded in the whip topping I realized there were a bunch of little chucks. There seemed to be an over powering taste of cream cheese ..... and I LOVE cream cheese and didn't know there was such thing as over kill of cream cheese. But I think it was purly because of the chunks.I used fat free cream cheese and lite whip topping.
I let the jello/strawberry mixture sit for an hour before putting it on top of the cream cheese/whip topping layer. However when I pulled the jello out of the fridge it has already set so I had to dump jello chunks on top of the cream/whip topping.
I still ate some of it and it was pretty good. My husband said it was better than he expected b/c he thought the ingredients sounded weird together.
I will probably try again or maybe request my mom make it :)

I hope this tastes good when it is done.  I followed another reviewers "advice" and doubled the jello.  What a messy mistake.  There was liquid jello all over my kitchen.  With an active 2 year old boy running around this was not ideal, plus now my floor, and myself are very sticky.  I think it will taste good.  But if I make this again, I will definately only use one package of jello.
Tried it in the morning, after it was all set.  Wasn't very good.  The pretzel crust was very soggy, and I did bake it.  All in all quite disappointing!

Okay, for me to give anything five stars that has CREAM CHEESE in it is saying something!  I despise cream cheese, sour cream, cheesecake, cottage cheese...generally most dairy products that smell and taste like cheese and/or sour.  I wanted to try this for myself because everyone at work was gobbling it up so fast.  I could barely taste the remnants of cream cheese!  The whipped topping did a great job of covering up that sour taste, and I think because I added an additional 2 tsp. of vanilla extract also made for the taste being 'softer' on my palate.  I actually doubled the recipe and made in spring form pans (the picture for the recipe looked so pretty!).  I was surprised that the pretzel layer stayed so crunchy for two days...normally any 'crust' on the bottom of anything gets soft, which I usually prefer.  The the crunch added nice dimension.  I wouldn't call this a salad though, more like a layered dessert.  I think next time I will add some vanilla and brown sugar to the pretzel crust.  It was still lacking some flavor.  And I think for presentation I would top with more fresh sliced strawberries.  I would like to experiment and add REAL whipping cream rather than whipped topping and then adjust sugar and vanilla accordingly.  I followed others advice and subbed some of the boiling water for the Jello with juice that had drained from the frozen strawberries.  This actually helped it not to be too sweet.  Overall, great tasting and looking dessert!

I've made this several times now. It is always well received and requested. You can use different fruits and jellos to alter the flavors while still maintaining a quality dessert. I enjoy a raspberry jello with pineapple. I love it!!

Winner! Here's some helpful tips. I thought this recipe didn't give enough of crust, so I actually doubled the crust because I wanted it a little thicker. It is a little hard to cut into, though, but that was expected. My crust did not stick to the pan at all. Also, make the crust the night before. When spreading the cream cheese layer on the crust, cover all of the crust so the jello doesn't seep through. Also make sure to let the cream cheese layer "set" in the fridge before adding the jello layer. When you dissolve all the jello, and then put the "frozen" strawberries in, the mixture will cool down itself, allowing you to pour directly on to the cream cheese layer without having to let it sit. Remember, do NOT thaw your frozen strawberries or else you will have to let the jello layer cool down in the fridge. I also doubled the jello layer and when pouring onto the cream cheese layer, I used a strainer to remove the fruit. I didn't want a chunky, fruity top, but just a gelatin layer. Yummy!

I made this today for a pool potluck.  The only thing I would say is make sure you have plenty of time!  It took a lot longer than the prep time listed with the recipe, I had to make and cool each layer individually.  All in all, not a lot of time, but a lot of time spent waiting for the layers to cool.  Not a problem if you are putzing around the house anyway.

That said, this was delicious and I had no less than 6 people ask for the recipe.  The only changes I made were to replace the white sugar for brown sugar in the pretzel crust (mmm) and to add a little extra knox gelatin in with the jello to be sure it was extra firm.

This dessert looks so pretty and tastes great!  I compared this to the other pretzel salads on this site and chose this one because it had more cream cheese.  I was using a 9x11 pan and wanted more guts.
The recipe is perfect the way it is but I did add some clear vanilla (maybe a 1/2 tsp?) to the cream cheese before folding in the whipped topping.  I used fresh strawberries and just sat them on top of the jello so each serving gets a strawberry.  Since I did not mix in frozen strawberries I left the boiling water at 2 cups (some suggest to lower the water amount). I made sure all layers were cold/set before adding the next laye.  
Thank you for this recipe I loved it and to all the reviewers with their helpful tips!

This is the BEST recipe for jello salad ever!  My family always puts me in charge of making the jello salad every year for christmas and thanksgiving, and beleive me there has never been any leftovers with this dish. It's the best part of the meal!  I swear if you make this dish you're gonna be making lots of people very happy and have them asking for more!   

*HINT*  I use fresh strawberrys, it definitely makes a difference

I frankly thought this was kinda of icky.  Sorry....My husband came up to me and whispered..."I think you messed up on the crust - I think there is way too much salt in it.  I explained that it was not supposed to be a graham cracker crust - But I felt like I needed to make an announcement that it was supposed to be salty....Try to picture yourself in that position and if you can imagine it - you will experience it - I am pretty sure -   I liked the top layers - but no one had seconds and I washed a ot down the snk at cleanup time..no thanks!

Excellent!  I would have given it 6 stars if I had that option.  Even my brother, who hates pretzel salad, ate 2 pieces and took a third home with him.  The cream cheese layer is amazing!

Excellent! YES it is a dessert salad as others mention (but I would think you could figure that out by the ingredients??). Very tasty! Love the salty sweet combo in the pretzel crust. 
Also - I think some may get off track by the fact that it says "1 box" or package of jello. Most stores carry the SMALL boxes which are only 3 oz. in greater quantity than the 6 oz large boxes these days. So you may need 2 boxes if using the smaller ones (just take note it says 6 oz.). Great!

Outstanding, and highly addictive, even for a self-professed chocoholic. I did find that I needed to use 2 cups of pretzels, possibly even more the next time. A definite favorite now...

Tasty. I needed considerably more pretzels than the recipe called for though. The crust stuck too, so I'll spray the pan with non-stick spray first next time.

I have made this more times than I can count and it is requested every Easter and at all family BBQs.  This is a sweet treat, not something you're going to eat a lot of.  Don't rate a recipe as bad if you don't like the nutritional content - simply don't make it or change it to meet your nutritional needs. Not every recipe appeals to everyone's needs and only make the ones that fit with your lifestyle!  We have used both regular cream cheese, cool whip and butter as well as the lighter versions of each.  My family prefers the combination of 1/3 fat cream cheese, regular cool whip and light butter. This time I chopped the frozen berries in the food processor for a bit (no sliced strawberries without sugar) and added a few more whole berries from a second bag.  If you do this, make sure you cut the boiling water a bit. We have also had with orange jello with mixed tropical fruit.

Instead of using frozen strawberries, I used fresh, and this dessert still came out spectacular. Like other reviewers, I let my gelatin thicken up a bit before putting it on the cream cheese layer. With using fresh strawberries, however, I didn't add the berries into the gelatin until after it had already thickened a bit in the fridge. I made a 13 X 9 pan of this, and it was gone in three days! Will definitely make it again, as it is both refreshing and tasty!

I have been making  this for over 15 yrs.  I don't call it a salad.  I use it as a dessert.  If you use low fat ingredients, you cut down a lot of fat and calories and you won't even know the difference.

This is the second time to make this and I prefer using raspberry jello and raspberries and or mixed berries.  Yummy!  Will be making this again tomorrow for a family dinner.  Thank you for submitting. To be sure, this is not a salad but a very yummy dessert.

I did this recipe for a potluck at work and it was a great smash I made two and before I could get any it was gone I asked my co-workers what they thought and they said it was great but a little salty on the base the next time I made it I did the lite cream cheese and lite whipped topping but made the base out of salt free pretzels and they enjoyed it much better I have given this recipe out every time I make it so I just run off a dozen copies and give them out very easy to make and when I did get some it was delicious

You need to add 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the pretzels.  Can't beat toasted pecans & pretzels together.  I've seen other versions that have the pecans.  However I tried it has written and it was very good, but would be even better with the pecans.  Also needed more strawberries in the topping.  Still, of course it is more of a dessert than a salad.  It's become our favorite for 4th of July.

great flavor no matter what kind of jello/berries you use (I've made it as recipe directed and also with raspberrie jello & raspberries, even raspberries & lime jello) 
the only thing I don't like about this recipe it that on your plate when trying to scoop it up the layers kind of seperate. I've made it many times and can't figure out how to make it not do this. 
Still worth making even though it does this :)

After reading other reviews, I refrigerated the strawberry gelatin mixture for about 30 minutes before assembling the salad.  Each layer spoke for itself.  This was delicious!

This was absolutely to die for!!!!!  I brought it for Father's day and it was a huge hit, everyone was raving over it and I gave the recipe out to several people!  The only ingredient I changed was that I used fresh sliced strawberries instead of frozen because the kids and I had just went strawberry picking.  And the only thing I did differently with the directions was that I let the jello/strawberry mixture sit in the fridge for 1 hour before pouring it over the cream cheese layer.  It turned out perfect!  Thank you for this awesome recipe!!!

I had such high hopes for this but the cream cheese layer just oozed out and you would of thought it was melted ice cream the only thing i changed was I decreased the sugar in the cream cheese mix to 3/4 cup. Will not make again

This recipe is fantastic.  It gets 5 stars for flavor (perfect for summer bbqs and parties) but 1.5 cups of crushed pretzels is NOT enough for a 9x13 pan.  I had to use an 8x8 square and I had leftovers of the cream cheese and strawberry layers.  Otherwise perfect recipe.

Well I was nervous taken on this recipe however once I got going I realized this is a very forgiving recipe. I made my pretzel crust with brown sugar instead of white sugar and only baked it for about 8 mins. Which made it chewy instead of a cement brick. I also cut the sugar down that you fold into the cream cheese and whip cream. I took this to a potluck at chruch on Easter with hopes I'd get to take home some leftovers but there was none! I'm so impressed with this recipe and I will be making this again and again!

The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it tasted good. I will NEVER make this again. This needs to be made in a dish bigger than a 9x13 because it overflows.  And it doesn't hold together well since the jello is on top instead of between layers.

Maybe this seems like a strange combination of ingredients, but let me say a taste buds delight!! I first had this at a graduation party and HAD to find the recipe. My quest was fierce, spending half my time at the party after who made this magnificent dish. WOW!! You gotta try it if you like the sweet salty combo foods. I might try some pecans in my next batch of crust? Pretzel thins work best to keep things krispy, I do it the old fashioned way with a bag and rolling pin.

absolutly delicious! i brought this to a "4th get-together" and it was a huge hit!  wonderful combo of sweet and salty.  followed the directions exactly -and came out perfect!

it really makes the perfect "4th of July desert"! just add fresh blueberries to the top, for a red/white/blue look.  or even better - line the blueberries in a square at the corner - and save a bit of the whip cream to pipe white stripes on the top for a "flag" look!  your friends will be impressed :-)

This turned out well, and was definitely popular at my recent cookout.  However, next time I make it, I am reducing the butter to one stick, and the sugar to 3/4 cup.  The pretzel layer was so buttery and sugary, it was overpowering.  My fiance said it tasted like cotton candy it was so sweet!

This was a hit with my family.  I made it for the fourth of July & there wasn't any leftovers.  I will make it again!  I did let the cream cheese harded before I put the jell-o on top.  It did work better.

Delish!  I made this for the Fourth of July and received 5 stars from everyone!
I made a few changes based on previous reviews.  I used 2 cups of pretzels, 3 Tbs Sugar, 1 Cream Cheese, 1 1/2 cups water and 2 pkgs of straberries.  I also used the strawberry flavored whipped topping just to be different!  Delish!  Oh, I also chilled the jello for about 5 minutes before pouring it on the cool whip layer.  It only leaked in the corners.  Perfect!!!

Curl your toes good!  Mmmm!!!!  It couldn't have been any better, everyone at the staff meeting wanted the recipe!  Be sure to spray your pan before putting yoru crust in though, I thought it wouldn't stick since it has butter but it does stick, fortunately only the first two portions were hard to get out.

Not the salad your mama used to make! This is more of a dessert, but who is complaining?  EXCELLENT.  Make sure you let the crust cool and leave the different layers to set as the timing indicates or you may end up with a gooey mixture.  If you make it as instructions say, you will have a gourmet-looking lite dessert.  My boyfriend's mother wanted the recipe after the first bite!  WARNING:  You won't be able to keep your hands off of it IF there is any left!  Definitely making this several times over this summer.  EASY.

I found it to be ok.  It could feed 16 (vs 8)of my friends easily. This is a lot of food.  If it helps I did the following and it set perfectly: 3 cups of pretzel sticks = 1-1/2 cups crushed.  I rolled with a rolling pin in a freezer bag.  One cube of butter = 3/4 cup of butter.  I also sprayed the pan before putting in the pretzel mix. and waited 30 min. before I added the cream cheese mixture (also, I melted the cream cheese in the microwave for 1 min.-easier to work with.)  I waited 30 more min. to add the gelatin/strawberry (fresh) mixture. Like the last review I would think about putting the cream mix. on top. If I make again I will half the recipe. I'm not done yet!

We all loved this as a little something sweet with our Easter dinner.  I'm a pretzel freak and love anything with pretzels in it, and the sweet and with the pretzels was perfect. Remember to spray your 9X13 with some cooking spray, or you may have a tough time dishing out as the crust can stick.  But trust me, get it out of the pan we did and yum!  This could also easily be lightened up using low fat ingredients.

Just brought this to an Easter dinner with 30 people at it. People really liked it even with all my mess-ups/shortcuts -- I figure it'll be even better if I make it correctly! Main problem: I totally didn't leave enough time to make this!!! I had a fan blowing on the pretzel crust to help cool it faster, didn't refridgerate to set the "white" layer at all, dumped fresh strawberries on the white layer, then poured the jello on top and stuck it in the FREEZER for about 15 minutes before we had to leave. Jello was still runny when we left but I planned to put it in the freezer at our destination too, so covered it with cling wrap -- but apparently not tightly enough because on the way there, most of the jello sloshed onto the floor of my car! Oops! And yet, people STILL gobbled it up! (Don't know if it would have been quite as popular with frozen strawberries instead of fresh since there was hardly any jello left to coat the strawberries...)

This is an easy recipe and tastes great!  I am always asked for the recipe whenever I bring it to a gathering.  I would suggest having the strawberries almost thawed before mixing them with the gelatin.

OMG!!! This has to be one of the best tasting desserts I have ever made & it was so easy!!! I made this for my Husbands B-day BBQ, and let me tell you our guests were fighting over the last few pieces.  No one could believe the crust was made from pretzels. Next time I think I may add a few more strawberries to the topping as with mine there were quite a few spots that were just gelatin, but it was FABULOUS!! Graet recipe Judy!!

Sweet, satly and YUMMY.  I used fat free whipped cream and cream cheese.  Also ran the strawberries through the food processer for just 3 seconds and also little bit of plain gelatin to help set up the top layer.  Was PERFECT and a huge hit.

Big hit at potluck!  Great make ahead dish.  I did decrease sugar a bit, and let jello set some before adding.  I made the night before and didn't have any to bring home.

This recipe was great! I followed the recipe exactly except I added more pretzels for the crust.  Next time I will use less sugar.  Not too good the next day due to the soggy pretzels. Will make again for Memorial Day Cookout.

This is a favorite at our house; sometimes it's dessert, and sometimes it's a side dish.  I happen to like mine sweeter; therefore, I use more sugar in both the crust and the filling.  I also like to crush the pretzels in a bag by hand.  The larger pieses hold on to the sugar and butter, making it so yummy.  Make sure you use good ingredients, and I suggest real BUTTER.

This is most certainly not a "salad" or a "jello mold", nothing that resembles low cal here! This is truly a delicious cheese cake dessert. Next time I will make this with less sugar, butter and low fat cool whip and cream cheese---I do not think these changes would hurt the recipe at all.

I decreased the butter to 1/2 cup in the crust; used only 3/4 cup sugar in the cream cheese part.
It was fantastic!!!! Can't praise this enough!
(I also let the jello set up a bit before spreading it on, so no soggy crust).

FYI--it freezes well.  I partially froze it, made slices in it and froze it the rest of the way.  So far, it has been in my freezer for over a week, I just take a piece out and let it sit to defrost while I eat dinner.  The crust is still perfectly crunchy!

Overall, I was very pleased with this recipe and it was a major hit at my Memorial Day cookout yesterday. I made this and a banana pudding and this won hands down! I, however was a little put off by the top jello layer. Although very good, I think it would be better with a thin layer of lemon curd(personal preference). My five year old daughter absolutely loved it--so this is definitely a keeper.

This is a fabulous recipe. cool and refreshing, and a little different from the norm.  I did add a little extra butter to the crust to help it to stay together a little better, but all in all, it is an excellent recipe.

I think this tastes much better if you top it off with a layer of Cool Whip.  If you want a cute garnish idea, make light lines in the Cool Whip with a knife where you want people to cut.  Slice some fresh strawberries and arrange two or three slices over lapping each other in each square.

Sensationally Scrumptious Salad!! I made this for Memorial Day and have been "told" to make it again for the 4th, (which I will gladly oblige just to satisfy my own taste buds.)

Very good.  Enjoyed by 47 people who had lunch today at our senior centre.  I did not use Cool Whip, instead I beat the cream cheese with whipping cream until a smooth consistency and added very little sugar to it - I probably added only about 1/2 C. sugar for the entire 50 servings I made - there's enough sugar in the crust and the jello together.  I also used fresh strawberries.  When I make this again, I'll increase the jello level.  These old time recipes are still good today.  Thank you to the poster.

Good.. but I listened to too many reviews and changed it. I think I ruined it by doing that. I doubled the jello portion and the crust and it was just too much. I will try again and just make it the way the recipe says to make it.

It was great, double the jello to make it proportionate t cream cheese filling, make sure jello is a little firm before adding it on top of cream cheese mixture

Love this! Have made it in other flavors including raspberry and cherry...all delicious! Best eaten in 3 days or less as crust gets soggy. Occasionally make it without crust which is good too.

I've made this dozens of times and I've found that using the butter flavored pretzels gives the best flavor. I also doubled the jello layer as someone had said before. It's a great summer hit.

Jello-I weirds me out so I used strawberry pie filling on the top instead... OMG, it was sooo good! Sweet and salty and buttery all in one bite. The cream cheese middle has a really nice flavor and creamy, light texture but it did not compete with the strawberries in sweetness.

this recipe is fantastic and I do not like or make anything with Jello as a rule.I did follow some of the tips given here: 1) use two 16 oz frozen strawberries using the juice as part of the mix with the jello and using 1/4c boiling water to dissolve the jello--but I used one pack and then added the second when it didn't seem to gel: 2) I used about 3 cups of chopped pretzels and bake for 8 1/2 minutes and it was perfect,but cut the sugar for the filling to a 'heavy' 3/4c sugar and that was enough. I did sprinkle some of the leftover pretzels over top to help with the extra jello on top. This was the biggest hit at dinner  I have made. I expected to come home with some but I was,pleasantly surprised, to come home with a totally empty pan!! last suggestion, use a 9x13 pan and no need to spray either.:)Have already been asked to make again. Thanks for a great salad-dessert!

AWESOME. If u want to eat this for several different meals, I recommend making several small batches. Once u cut into it the pretzels get soggy from the juices.

Loved this!  Made it for a Thanksgiving dessert, so I subbed cranberry gelatin for the strawberry, and added a little orange zest and orange extract to the cream cheese mixture.  I made mine in a 9" springform pan, and I had a little "juice" left over from the gelatin/strawberry mixture (top layer went almost to the top of the pan) so if I were to use the same type of pan (which I recommend - the layers come out so pretty!) I would reduce the water to about 1 1/2 cups.  Otherwise, flavor was amazing - salty-sweet crust, light creamy filling and fruity topping.

Great recipe! I did lighten it up a bit by using sugar free jello, light cool whip and light cream cheese. And 1/2 cup butter is plenty also. Ive made it both ways and my family couldn't tell the difference. The person who gave it only one star and called it a "heart attack waiting to happen" is completely wrong and should stick to eating celery sticks if they cant eat something in normal proportions.

This was a huge hit. Everyone wants the recipe. To save fat I used Neufchatel cream cheese. Never has been a problem. I tried to use fresh strawberries, but it came out a little watery. I think one reviewer suggested less water in the jello which seems like a must. Also, It is never suggested to smooth the cream cheese to all edges so the jello does not seep to the crust. My second time I messed up with it that way by having one little spot it seeped through. Okay, reviewing has helped me to see how to get it right. It tastes awesome!

Made this for weekend guest and it was tee-totally AMAZING!!!!!  So, so delicious!  Followed the recipe with one exception.  I used fresh strawberries which I sliced (about 2 and 1/2 cups sliced).  Strawberries this time of year are not real sweet so after slicing them I sprinkled a little sugar over them and stirred them up real good and that made them plenty sweet enough for adding to the recipe when the time came.  I'm not kidding.....this is so beautiful and so delicious that it will definitely be on my list of things to make for any special gathering at my home.  You have got to try it and you are gonna love it!!  Don't change a thing.  The ratios are perfect.  WOW WOW WOW.

The flavor combination of this can't be beat.  However, the ingredient ratios could use some tweaking.  To get a crust that covers a 9x13 I do think you need 2 cups of crushed pretzels.  I used only 1 Tablespoon of sugar and that was plenty.  I did use the 16 ounces of cream cheese but I only use about 2/3 of the whipped topping to mix with it and we found that to be plenty sweet.  I ended up following the recommendation of a friend this time and used a product called Danish Desert in place of the jello - 2 packages, and only 1 1/2 cups of boiling water.  It has a more intense flavor than the regular jello and also a slightly different texture - a little more silky, so to compensate I also added an envelope of Knox unflavored gelatin.  Finally, I used 20 ounces of frozen berries in syrup.  The advice of other reviewers regarding baking time for the pretzels, making a 'seal' with the cream cheese layer, and allowing the jello layer to chill significantly before adding it on top are all good suggestions.  The finished product is a beautiful presentation and an excellent combination of flavors that provide a great counterpoint to the salty and savory flavors of a holiday meal.

I've been making this (without a recipe to follow) since I ordered it as a "salad" with a meal in Greenwood Delaware in 1988.  What a surprise when it arrived and I realized it was actually a dessert...and the best one EVER.  My kids used to ask for it instead of a birthday cake.  It has everything, salty/crunchy/creamy/sweet/tart.  Nothing else is like it.  I use low fat cream cheese, lite Cool Whip, and sugar free Jello to ease my conscience...and sometimes I substitute frozen raspberries.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  The one I made from my memory of how this tasted is the same as the one provided here!

Wow! This is so good! I love the photo's that different cooks post. I liked Sarah Waltrips photo the best so I also baked mine in a springform pan. I sprayed it with Butter flavored Pam and with my big cake lifter from Wilton, I had no trouble getting it onto  a pretty pedestal cake dish. It was as pretty as Sarahs. I followed the hints about not over baking and chilling each layer before adding the next. I also used 2 cups of pretzels and was careful to not pulverize them and not use all of the salty crumbs in the bottom of the bag I smashed them in. I just don't get why it's called salad, haha ha.

I have been making this for years, but had to add this..do use margarine instead of butter, I made the mistake of using butter & it was too hard to cut the crust...my recipe uses pineapple juice instead of water. Its good both ways..

This is always a big hit!!  I add miniature marshmellows to the cream cheese layer!  Yummm!!   And, if you're making it for the first time, please read other reviews concerning the timing of the layers, e.g. if the middle layer isn't set, and the jello isn't already thickened, it won't work right.

I absolutely loved this, I did a few little revisions - like  others said, let the jello and strawberries gel a little first before pouring onto the top. I used pineapple juice instead of water in the jello mix and I used three cups of sliced fresh strawberries instead of frozen. Also, if you are using salted butter for the crust, use unsalted pretzels, otherwise the salt can be a little overwhelming. I would also let the cream cheese get to room temperature before creaming as it was a little difficult to spread over the crust without pulling it up. I will be making this again and again and experimenting with different fruits/jellos!

The taste of this recipe is fabulous! I love the sweet and salty combo! I would reduce the butter to 1/2 cup next as the pretzels were swimming in butter and it got all over my oven. Loved the taste as did my guests!

Delicious and easy to make.  Kids will have fun making it too.  Always a crowd pleaser.  I follow the directions to a T and it turns out great.  Make you allow enough time for each phase to cool/chill, don't try and rush it or the layers won't turn out right.  Enjoy!

One of my favorites for summer, although I wouldn't classify it as a salad.  It seems more like a dessert to me.

This is one of my favorite recipes!  It's a staple in my summermenus - people of all ages love it!

-I often make it with raspberries and raspberry jello instead of strawberries.

-I also top it with a 4th layer of 8 more ounces of cool whip topping.

Enjoy!

I remember this from my childhood and searched Allrecipes for it...this is by far the best! I made this last weekend for 4th of July (and added fresh blueberries to the ffresh strawberries and jello mixture to make red, white and blue) now I am making 2 for another cookout today.  Everyone toldme there just was not enough to go around last time! Thanks for the recipe!

Never made this before so i was worried after reading some of the reviews.  It turned out fabulous!  Lots of requests for the recipe.  I made the crust first, while that was cooling made the jello w/ 1cup boiling water, ice, and juice from strawberries.  Let that cool in fridge while i mix cream cheese and cool whip!  No leakage between layers!  Turned out beautiful and delicious!  If I can do it any one can!!!

I liked this recipe.  I only had 1 small box of strawberry Jello and didn't realize I needed the large box.  I used a box of pineapple Jello to make up for it and it tasted great!  I think next time I will only use 1 pack of cream cheese since that flavor overwhelmed me.  Otherwise I will make this again forsure.

This has got to be one of my very favorite desserts!!!  I haven't tried it yet, but I'm pretty sure it could very easily be made sugar free/low fat by changing out a few ingredients.  Perfect summer dessert!

THIS IS A MUST HAVE AT CHURCH POT LUCKS!!! I HAVE MADE IT ONCE, AND WAS ASKED TO MAKE IT AGAIN, AND AGAIN! :) one tip. the last time i made it, i followed the pretzel part just fine, BUT then i decided to crush them more After i added in the butter and sugar and pressed it into the pan. DOING that seems to lessen the great taste of the pretzel crust. too fine crumbs and hot butter turns it into just a pie crust that taste well, strange. i would follow this pretzel recipes part and not crush after you add butter to make it flatter, or go farther. i did and it turned out weird. remember- Not the recipes fault. My fault. :) BUT GREAT RECIPE!!!! ALSO MAKE SURE THE COOLWHIP AND CREAM CHEESE ARE BOTH ROOM TEMPATURE FOR EASY MAKE!!!

I made this for Easter gathering, just o.k. for me, if you make this in a 13x9 pan with the amount of strawberries in recipe it will be very scant topping, not crazy about the topping, crust was great, probably will not make this one again, sorry just so so for me.

I made this exactly as the directions called for except i made it in a 9-inch springform.  The only complaint I have is it needed more pretzels.  Next time I will def double the pretzel crust.  YUMMY

I am good at making main courses but my dessert skills are not that stellar.  However, when I presented this at my Christmas table, I got wows, gasps, and yummos all around. It is easy to assemble, has great presentation, is colorful and out-of-this world delicious. I highly recommend this recipe. I used unsalted butter, and substituted raspberry jello and frozen raspberries.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving this year.  We had about 25 people for dinner - and I could hear people saying to each other, "have you tried this?!  It's so good".  Even people on diets had to go and "try" a little bit.  I followed some suggestions from other users and I was happy with outcome.  I baked crust only about 12 minutes.  I also only used 1 pkg. of cream cheese (rather than 2).  I also let the jello and strawberries (I used 2 tubs of strawberries) sit in the fridge for a little bit until semi-set - but don't let it sit too long because then it looks a little "chunky".  I'm sure recipe as is would be great too!  I'll definitely make this again!

This was excellent! HUGE HIT! Wished I had skipped dinner and went straight for dessert. I took the advice of someone who suggested adding 2 packages of jello - I used 1.5 packages (no increase of water). My package of frozen strawberries was a little larger than called and added them all. Will make this again and again! Thanks for sharing!

This is excellent!  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out well.  Another reviewer suggested making more of the jello layer, but I love how the cream cheese layer is thick and the jello compliments it.   Everyone loved it at our Thanksgiving meal yesterday!

This turned out great! I got a lot of positive reviews from family! Only advice I have is, when doing the pretzel crust, do NOT pack it down into the pan. It will then become tough to cut after baking! I also changed it up some, and used one strawberry flavored cream cheese along with one reg. cream cheese! Like other reviews suggestions, also make sure the cream cheese mixture is spread evenly over the crust, or the gelatin will leak down into the crust!

It was delicious and a huge hit. I loved that it didn't feel heavy on a hot summer day. There are two things I would do differently next time, though.  First,  I used a springform pan which made it beautiful but left it with no structure to hold it up during travel or in the heat. Unless I am serving it at home I will make it in a pyrex 13x9. Second, I would only let the jello set for 45 min. I left it in the fridge for a little over an hour and it caused the jello to be somewhat lumpy and not gel together nicely. With all that being said, this will be a signature dessert in our household from now forward!

My husband says this is his favorite desert EVER. :) I didn't change a thing, except using fresh strawberries instead of frozen. It is also good with raspberries (in raspberry Jello or strawberry Jello). I usually favor things a little more "natural," but this is too good to resist!

Awesome recipe..I used a springform pan and used 2 packages of jello. I also used a crust that called for brown sugar instead of white sugar.

Followed recipe to the T.  Perfect.  I made it in a spring form pan and it looked just like the picture.  We had to travel with it, so to keep it cold, I double-wrapped the bottom and sides with aluminum foil, and put some on top.  Kept in nice and cold.  If you want to take a crowd-pleasing dessert....this is the one. Thank you for sharing.

I have made this many many times!!  Love it everytime.  Trick to making sure that the jello doesn't leak to the pretzel layer is to press down the cream cheese around the edges then up the sides of the dish a tad to push out any bubbles.  Make sure that there are no holes and it won't leak through.

Have made this recipe several times over the years, not a big strawberry fan, however have spiced the cream cheese mixture with a little ground allspice and used peach jell-0 with a little spice and fresh chopped peaches

I should have used fresh strawberries, they turned out soggy, and there should be more jello mix because my jello/strawberry layer was a little thin.

This is really good...salty and sweet at the same time. but really make sure you let that jello sit a while before you add it on top of the cream cheese layer....this is a crucial step! I do not like soggy...and if your jello is runny ...you will have a soggy crust.

Delicious. I agree with other cooks that you should not rush to put the layers together. I also think that this could use more crust. It appears that the crust was cut by a quarter. I would use 2 cups of pretzels, 1 cup of unsalted butter, and 6 table spoons of sugar. This is a very sinful dish so I would only make on special occasions. It is a crowd pleaser.

Very good! I agree with most comments however, do NOT leave jello in frig. too long or it will be clumpy and bumpy and hard to pour over cream cheese!  Also I would spray bottom of pan with Pam and NOT bake crust too long.  Mine stuck a wee bit (might have been because I rant out of pretzels, too, and substituted a few ritz crackers which was delish!)  Hubby said "delicious"; one woman at picnic said "thanks for bring back a delicious memory from my childhood"!

Have been wanting to make this for a long time and finally did for a Mother's Day picnic. Absolutely delicious. I used raspberry jello and fresh raspberries in place of the strawberries. Thanks for a great recipe that will become a standard dessert in our household!

I would like to try this with a layer of sliced fresh fruit cut up, on top of the cream cheese mix and only half the jello, more crust, and maybe raspberry (like one reviewer suggested) flavor.

One of our favorite deserts since trying it.  My sister decided it also works for breakfast since it has dairy in it (cream cheese) and fruit (strawberries).  We also tried a variation with cranberry jellow and cranberry sauce, it was good for Thanksgiving but not AS GOOD as the original.  Use brand name pretzels they are worth the added cost and flavor for the recipe - the sweet salty combination really comes alive.

This is a good tasting recipe,but a few things need changing. The margarine & brown sugar should be melted before adding to the crushed pretzels, otherwise the crust doesn't hold. The cream cheese layer needs to be chilled at least 45 minutes(until cold& firm) before adding the next layer or they will mix together. Also,if you're going to make this in a 9x13 pan,as this calls for,then you'll need 2 1/2 cups of crushed pretzels,double the cream cheese and strawberry layers,if you want it to look like the layers in the photo.If not your layers will be thin.

I wasn't overly impressed.  I think that if more strawberries were added in the Jello mi it ourl be less of a jello texture and more of a strawberry topping.  I've made somehting like this with raspberries and it was good also.  I also added a little whipped topping on top when serving.

I always use frozen stawberries for this recipe. The jello is then firm enough to pour right over the cream cheese filling. I ALWAYS spray my dish with Pam and have never had any trouble removing the salad.  My family requests this at every get together, when they were little my granddaughters would just say they wanted me to make the "red stuff."

I also used fresh strawberries. I made the strawberry gelatin and while that was cooling off, I cut one pound of strawberries into small pieces. I stuck them both into the fridge and once the gelatin started to thicken, I added the strawberries and then poured that over the cream cheese mixture. It set perfectly! My mother never had it made with fresh strawberries before and said it was the best she ever had. My husband who never had this before in his life thought it was out of this world and he doesn't even really like cream cheese or strawberries, so that says alot!

I've made this many times but I use raspberry jello and frozen raspberries instead of the strawberries. The raspberries are not as sweet as the strawberries and I think it's tastes better. Plus smaller pieces of fruit. Just my preference, but this is still a keeper.

This was so yummy - I couldn't find frozen strawberries here in the UK - so I used can (next time will slice up a bit)  And had to use whipping cream with a bit of vanilla sugar since there is no frozen whipped topping here also.  But it came out great.  Thanks!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site!  I've made it with two reduced fat cream chease, two regular and one regular, one reduced fat.  I have not tried fat free.  I use FRESH strawberries as I don't think frozen taste or look as good.  I make the gelatin first and let it set a bit and pour that over the cold cream cheese mixture.  I use butter flavored pretzels.  Also you can use reduced fat whipped topping or fat free.  Great dish that everyone has loved.  I have to try not to eat all of it if it's sitting in my frig!!  It is truly hard, I love, love, LOV"E IT!!

Just like mama used to make when I was a kid... still as I remember it, too.  I easily halved this recipe to fit an 8x8 pan (make sure pan is sprayed with non-stick spray for easier removal of crust), using a Tbsp or so less of the melted butter in the crust.  I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and a little less than the recommended whipped topping (also lo-fat) so the filling would still set.  Since I only needed 3oz of Jello, one small box did the trick.  As others have done, I used fresh strawberries instead of the frozen, adding them to the Jello once cooled.  Deee-licious.  Thanks for the memories!

This recipe is fantastic! Other fruits I've tried so far include blueberry, raspberry and cranberry/raspberry. All are excellent! I double the crust because I like it so much. Be sure to grease your pan-it dishes out much easier that way. I also chill the jello/fruit mix for just a few minutes before pouring over cream cheese layer. That way it definitely won't seep through.

It would be a good idea to grease the pan if you are serving this straight from the fridge. Took this dish to a potluck and people could only scrape off the cream cheese and fruit layer (I uesd raspberry).  That stuff was good, but how embarrassing the crust was rock solid in the pan.

The strawberry/pretzel combination is definitely THE BEST. It is always a huge hit. With this variation however, I made a few slight tweaks. I almost doubled the amount of pretzels in the crust so it was drier and not so buttery, and I let the gelatin mixture set for a little while before pouring it over the cream cheese layer so it wasn't so runny. What a tasty treat!

I made two pans of this dessert for Christmas Eve.  One for our home and one for husband's work.  Both were big hits.  The dish came home from work completely empty.  I made one with sugar-free jello and low-fat cream cheese.  You couldn't tell any difference in the taste.  I'll be making this again.

I make this every year for my Thanksgiving table and for company and family potlucks. I usually make it with raspberry jello and frozen raspberries and it turns out beautiful! I have tried it w/blueberries (and blueberry jello), cherries (and cherry jello), and blackberries (and bb jello). The raspberries are my favorite however. This is a very versatile and fancy looking dish. The sweetness of the berry, creamy smooth cream cheese center and salty pretzel base are amazing together. You must try it! You, or your guests, will not be dissapointed. This can be made days ahead of time as well! Another plus!

This recipes was really good.  I made it for a 4th of July party and everybody loved it.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and fresh strawberries.  The only thing that I didn't like was the crust didn't want to stay together. This recipe is a keeper.

First of all, I followed to directions exactly. The pretzel crust was sooo good. The middle layer was pretty good, but that gelatin layer on top was awful and totally did not taste right with the crust. We all picked the top layer off and just ate the bottom two. If I make this again, I will use sliced fresh strawberries and use strawberry glaze on top, and totally omit the gelatin.

The overall taste of this recipe is excellent, BUT, the recipe is incomplete.  I have a tendency to alter recipes to my own taste, but since I was making this for a group (Easter Brunch), I went word for word.  Make sure you grease the pan before pressing in the crust or it will stick (not in directions.)  I used frozen strawberries, as the recipe suggests, not frozen-sliced strawberries in syrup.  The berries are too big if not sliced.  And the consistancy of the jello is a bit like jello jigglers (almost too firm) since 1/2 the normal amout of water for jello is used (usually 4 cups for a 6oz pkg of jello.)  Like I stated before, it tasted great, but was nearly impossible to serve, and may be more interesting with lemon jello and a bit more water (maybe 3 cups instead of 2.)

Ok, clearly I have missed something. First of all it IS NOT a salad, it is a pie. But even as  a pie, the top gelatin layer didn't set very well and I had to take it out, and mix in another box of jello with 1 cup of boiling water....and replace the "top". Finally ended up mixing it all together anyway...so technically it was a salad I suppose. The cheescake portion and the pretzels part tasted excellent, but the gelatin strawberry part- yech-both  before and after my "correction". Somehow the gluey jello part didn't do the rest justice.

This is a great dish. We liked it the same day it was made, we did not like it as much when the pretzels were moist. I make this a lot for work parties. Great Recipe!!

Excellent as dessert or salad. I had trouble getting it out of pan using cooking spray, so will grease the dish better next time. It was great - thanks!

I thought I'd try this one because of all the great reviews, but for the pretzel crust...I just can't get use to it.  One problem might be that I didn't completely crumbled the pretzels and everytime I get a piece of pretzel with a bite, I can't enjoy it.  The rest of it is good.

My husband and I liked the jello and cream cheese layers, but didn't care at all for the salty taste of the pretzel crust.  I think I'll try it again with a graham cracker or cookie crust.

I made this for the first time for a picnic at my husbands job.  I wasn't sure how everybody would react to the pretzel crust, so I used graham cracker crumbs instead. It was a real hit.  I'll try it next time with the pretzels.

My crust got very hard.  I left the pretzels in smallish pieces instead of crushing them to dust and the pieces were too hard for my elderly family members to chew.  They requested a second try with a graham cracker crust.  I will be using more strawberries for that one, as the jello parts that had none in it reminded me of eating a spoonful of jam.  Tasty, but needs tweaking.

Was looking for my lost recipe and this was it.  I love this 'salad'.  It is always such a hit.  Just remember to take copies of the recipe with you because everyone is going to want to have it.

YUM YUM YUM!! My only piece of advice is make sure the cream cheese mixture is pushed into the side of the dish and there are no gaps. If there is a gap, even just a tiny one, the jello liquid will seep into the pretzel mixture and it becomes a soggy mess instead of a crispy layer!

I made this for our family get-together for Easter. It was very good and easy to make, although there was a lot of waiting in-between steps, so plan accordingly if you are making it the day of your event. 
Here is where I varied from the recipe:
I followed another reviewer and used 1 cup of powdered sugar in the middle mixture instead of plain white sugar.
I used two packages of Jell-O.
I used 1 1/2 cups of fresh strawberries instead of frozen and I think I could have used a half a cup more.
After the first layer was out of the oven, I put it directly into my freezer. I made sure the cream cheese was softened and mixed it with the other ingredients thoroughly. I then put that in the refrigerator. I didn't allow it to get too cold as I wanted it to be easy to spread. I made the Jell-O but did NOT put the strawberries in immediately. I put the pan of hot Jell-O in the freezer, took the cream cheese mixture out and then layered the second layer and put it back in the freezer. I had no issues with the pretzels sticking to the mixture. I followed the directions on the Jell-O box and added the fruit only after the Jell-O had cooled and thickened. Once it did, I added the fruit and poured the mixture on top of the other layers and placed in the fridge. It seemed like it set immediately.
Great recipe! I know I will make this again!

This is so good! My family loves it and it gets eaten very fast. I have found that when I let the jello mixture sit to thicken, it doesn't adhere to the cream cheese mixture and it gets quite stiff. I pour it over the chilled cream cheese layer after letting it cool only very slightly. It takes longer to set, but it's just better that way.

I have made this many, many times over the years and it has always been a big hit. 
It is such a pretty dessert for the holiday's.  Make it in a clear glass dish and it will show the colors.
Easy, pretty,  and delicious.

It's good only the first day you make it when the pretzels are crunchy. When the pretzels begin to get soggy, it becomes a big mushy too sweet mess.

Excellent recipe. The only change I made was using fresh strawberries. It's so good...kind of wish I had some right now!

We added a layer of cool whip on top as well, so we could write on the cake.  Was difficult to spread as the frozen berries were whole.  Next time would use fresh, cut berries so they were more even.  Also, make sure to stir the jello in the saucepan before adding the strawberries.  We lost some geletin in the pan  :( GREAT flavor and everyone loved it- was a hit!  But A LOT of sugar

I've made this dozens of times and I've found that using the butter flavored pretzels gives the best flavor. I also doubled the jello layer as someone had said before. It's a great summer hit.

I needed to make this without the red food coloring present in the jello so used plain gelatin and cranberry juice. I made one batch as the recipe is written using the jello. I then made a second batch with the gelatin and cranberry juice. Guests that tried both commented that they liked the cranberry juice batch better! I diluted the juice 50/50 with water. This is a favorite recipe that I have used for years and now it can satisfy those with dietary restrictions of red dye. I also use half strawberries and half blueberries.

I must be doing something wrong than the rest of the reviewers. I made this recipe and picture-wise, it came out perfect. But the jello was far too tart in comparison to the subtle sweetness of the cream cheese. And though the pretzels are intended to give a nice crunch, they become softened if this dessert sits for more than 30 minutes and isn't in the fridge. All my Christmas guests could do was suggest ways to change it and make it better. For example, maybe a pecan crust, and a strawberry glaze or jam. I'm sorry, but for my Christmas, it just wasn't a hit.

This salad is a perennial favorite at holidays. It's been served ever since I can remember.  Everyone fights over it.  It's my absolute favorite!  A few years ago I had to go gluten free.  My sister grudgingly agreed to make it with gluten free, Glutino pretzels.  Guess what, they are better in the salad than regular pretzels! (Usually not the case with gluten free foods) My whole family agrees.  The gluten free pretzels taste like regular pretzels but hold their crunch much better.

I tried this recipe, but instead of strawberry jello and strawberries, I used raspberry jello and raspberries.  It was wonderful!  Mine didn't look nearly as nice as the picture, but it tasted great.

Never thought of combining these ingredients before but they are delicious!  It surprises everyone to have the salty base with the sweet toppings but it's a hit.  I haven't figured out yet how to make the edges look nice and smooth like in photos, but I just serve it out of the 9x13 pan.  Still tastes the same :)

I made it yesterday. Everyone liked it but compared it to my strawberry angel food dessert(almost the same recipe minus the pretzel crust plus pieces of angel food cake mixed into the filling). They missed the angel food cake but liked the crust. So next time I will make the crust and mix the cake into the filling. Will let you know the result.

The flavor combination is superb. However, I upped my pretzels to just over 2 cups (as suggested in some reviews), but it was still nowhere near enough. I'll probably do closer to 4 cups next time. I used a standard 9x13 as called for, but was rather disappointed at the scant amount of pretzel once it all came together. Also, after chilling for 6 hours, my jello mixture still isn't set. It's thickened but still far too soupy to count as a gelatin layer. I read other reviews suggesting that you reduce the amount of boiling water by how much liquid your strawberries are sitting in so that there isn't too much water for the jello to set up. I did this. Still didn't work.

Very easy to make & pleasant to eat in the hot summer months. Pulsed pretzels in food processor so they mere not overly ground.  Subbed Splenda for sugar in crust & cream cheese mix. Cooked crust 10 minutes then let it cool in fridge. Spread cream cheese mix on cooled crust, then stuck back in fridge.   Made fruit topping with sugar free Jello & previously frozen fresh strawberries I had on hand.  Let fruit topping cool in fridge for one hour, then spread over crust with cream cheese layer & kept chilled until serving. Hubs had three helpings, so that is my affirmation that it is a keeper recipe.  Thanks Tom!

I used a 10" springform pan.  I used only 1/2 cup of butter in the crust and found the butter didn't seep out the bottom as other reviewers experienced.  My only downfall was since I used frozen strawberries, it cooled the gelatin faster than I expected and 15 minutes in the frig was way too long.  So I had to slightly "melt" the gelatin on the stove before topping the cream layer.  Other than that, it turned out pretty darn yummy!

This is a great dessert! Very good on a hot day. I always make during the the summer months. I do cool the jello a bit before adding this to the last layer so it doesn't sink into the white cream cheese and cool whip. It does get eaten over any other jello dessert where ever I take it.

I had this at a birthday party a few years ago and have been looking for the recipe ever since! I am so happy to have found this!!!! I absolutely LOVE this dessert...yes dessert NOT salad! 
I did do a few minor changes but nothing drastic, I added vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, and only added 3T of sugar to the pretzel crust mix. 
I also put the jell-o mix in the fridge to 'set' a little before pouring on top of the cream cheese. I think this helps it not to 'run' down over the pretzel on the side of the pan, who wants a soggy crust?!?!
All in all great dessert!! A very must for a July 4th BBQ!

This would be good at a party, where I would only eat a little.  Not worth the effort to make at home, and too sweet to eat in large amounts.  I used a spring form pan as someone suggested.  Although it looked beautiful when it came out, it made a mess of melted butter in the oven as the butter seeped out all over.

Loved the dessert, but I added 12 ounces of fresh strawberries to the frozen one's.  The next time I will only use 1 cup of boiling water and will use 16 ounces of fresh strawberries!

I love this recipe. I did alter it a bit for my own tastes. For the crust I used brown sugar instead of white and I added some pecans to it. For the cream cheese portion I added a two teaspoons of vanilla extract while I beat the cream cheese. I also didn't use the jello. I opted to just use fresh sliced strawberries, cherries, blueberries and blackberries in any combination. My family and friends absolutely devour this anytime I bring it to a gathering and fight for the leftovers. Have fun with it!

Brought to a party and it was GONE.  Amazing! And I suggest cooking the pretzel layer for 10 minutes, no longer. In the very end  15-25 minutes in the freezer does the chilling Perfectly!

I love this dessert - I had to double the ingredients for the pretzel crust, since the amount specified seemed a little too thin and would've left gaps on the bottom of my pan. I think next time I make this I will paint some melted chocolate onto the top of the pretzel layer and freeze before I put the cream cheese layer on, so that the pretzel layer doesn't get so soggy so quickly.

This can also be made using frozen raspberries and raspberry gelatin in place of the strawberries...I think the raspberries give it an added flavor pop!!

AWESOME! Made to recipe as far as measurements. I messed up and didn't put whipped topping in cream cheese/sugar, so spread over. I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. It was DELICIOUS and everyone raved! Thanks!

love this!  I make it with raspberry jello/rasbperries instead because I prefer the tartness.  Also, only use 1 package cream cheese.  everything else I do pretty much as states!

YUM!!! This really is a wonderful recipe.  My kids like the flavor of strawberry, but do not like the "chunky" consistency of the fruit, so I omitted them from the recipe.  I used 2 ( 6oz) boxes of jello with 3 cups of boiling water and made sure the jello set before adding it to the cream cheese filling.  They loved it!!!!

I used raspberries instead of strawberries and I think the slight tartness of raspberries goes really good with the salty and sweet combo.

Delicious, I make it for thanksgiving every year. This year I was expecting a guest who was allergic to strawberries so instead I used raspberry Jello with a frozen fruit mix that had raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. It was delicious.

This is the best pretzel salad I have had in a long time.  I have made it several times to take to parties and everyone raves about it.  I get special requests to make this dish to bring to get-to-gethers.  This is a family favorite!

the Pretzel crust is shockingly yummy!  I was worried the gelatin was going to bleed down through the cream cheese mixture but again I was happily surprised.

Wow!  Delicious!  The pretzel layer was so good!  Everyone asked what it was made out of and were surprised it was pretzels.  I found the pretzels were crumbly when I added the cream cheese layer, but it still held together alright when serving.  I doubled the jello, but only added 3 cups total of water.  It had lots of flavor and still held together well.  Looked beautiful too!  Rave reviews from my BBQ guests!  It is nice when a simple and easy recipe is such a home run!

A great summer dessert.  This was easy to make and had the right combination of sweet to salty.  It was a huge hit with both adults and kids alike and the novelty of eating a "pretzel salad" really made my four year old son's day.

I'll one-and-one-half the crust if I make this a 3rd time. I forgot the sugar in the filling the 2nd time and it was definitely edible. Leaving the sugar out of the crust is beyond fine, and substituting some raspberries in the jello tasted absolutely fine.

I had this saved for forever, wanting to make one as pretty as the picture. I did mine in a springform pan, and the pretzel crust barely covered the bottom, so if you do a 9x13 you may want to double that part. Also, if you do it in a springform, put it on a cookie sheet!! I did not and some butter dripped down and caught fire in the oven. It was a bit scary. I used part white and part brown sugar in the crust. Because of my smaller pan, I probably only used about half of the cream cheese mix. I used fresh strawberries, sliced (a whole lb). As others suggested, I let the jello gel for about an hour before pouring it on top. It was good, but not great. I actually thought it was better the second day when the flavors melded more and the crust softened up. Hubby loved it though. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my familly and it was just ok.  The top is wonderful but the pretzel bottom did not go with the cream cheese and strawberry mix.
Would be great with graham cracker bottom.

Awesome! Brought this to a cookout and everyone loved it. I made it in a spring form pan and it looked beautiful. Note: make sure your pan doesn't leak! Mine did a little and I lost some butter in the crust. I used a 3oz box of raspberry Jello and a 3oz box of strawberry, and also fresh sliced strawberries. Will make this again for Easter.

Everyone who tried this had something good to say about it. I dissolved the jello in 1 cup of boiling water, and and measured 2 cups of sliced strawberries, and topped the 2 measuring cups of strawberries with water. Hope that makes sense.  Anyways this is great try it.

This is an awesome recipe, the perfect combination of sweet and salty.  My family and I have been making this for years now.  I have made this with fat free cream cheese and Splenda, and I've also made the regular version.  The lower calorie way is pretty good, but of course full fat and sugar always taste the best.  This dish is always requested...kids and adults alike will love it.  It is simple to make, nothing fussy and works well as a dessert or a side dish.  Having said that, we usually make it as a side dish and then put what's left out with dessert as well.  There is never ANY left after that.  A+++

Great recipe. The crust was not too thick, just right and I used blackberries w/ sugar free rasberry gelatin it tasted amazing. I will definitely use this recipe in the future. Thanks!

It was alright. The crust stuck to the bottom of the glassware and made for terrible presentation but still tasted alright til it got soggy. Don't think I'll be makin this again though...

Timing this is the most difficult part of it. One mistake I made was to not put the cream cheese layer all the way to the sides. My crust was a little crumbly and when I poured the strawberry mixture, it seeped under the other two layers and made the crust into mush. I think if I spread the cheese all the way to the sides, that will keep that from happening.

Really good!  Family loves it.  Pretzels are a little salty for the crust, in my opinion but it is still very good.  I might do 1/2 pretzels & 1/2 graham crackers next time just to see if that cuts back on the saltiness.  Used low fat cream cheese. I recommend putting fresh strawberries on top of the jello mixture also.  Used 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar and more pretzels for the crust.  More like 2 1/4 cups.

This is a simple desser that is delicious. Instead of regular jello, I used sugar free. Instead of regular cream cheese, I used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese. It turned out great.

Excellent! I increased the pretzels to about 2 cups (that's the best part of the salad), and sugar for crust to 5 Tbsp. I kept everything else as is. Followed other tips such as making sure the cream cheese layer is all the way to the edge of the pan to make sure the jello topping doesn't get down to the pretzels. Also, let the jello start to set up slightly before putting on top. Big hit at our family gathering for the 4th!

Yummy!  I used sugar free jell-o,  one 8 ounce block of cream cheese, one 8 ounce tub of strawberry cream cheese because that's what I had on hand, & I could only find a 10 ounce bag of strawberries at the store, and it was plenty.

Love this! I have made it in the past from a recipe a co-worker shared years ago. The only changes I make are to use one cream cheese as opposed to two and double the jello. I also use pineapple juice in the jello in replacement for one cup cold water. It adds to the flavor.

This is a very good recipe.  I needed about 2 cups of crushed pretzels to cover the bottom of my 9x13 pan nicely.  Use a glass dish, so that you can see the pretty layers of the finished product!  Like other reviews, I used only 1 cup of boiling water to dissolve the Jello, then added strawberry juice from the package and ice water to make up the second cup.  I did not double the amount of Jello, as suggested in another review - the thickness of the strawberry layer is sufficient just as it is written in the recipe.  A big hit at Easter dinner - I will make this again.

I made this for my husband to take to a work potluck and it got raves! The only change I made was to use 1 1/2 c of hot water, and it came out great! Followed other reviewers suggestions to pull the crust out of the oven at 10 minutes. Thanks a lot, Judy and Tom!

Excellent recipe and easy to prepare!! This recipe is always requested by my family and friends and has become a staple for all of our holiday dinners. I usually make an extra pan as people always request to take some home after dinner! After preparing this for a couple of years now, I have discovered that it is helpful to grease the pan before putting in the pretzel layer. Also, do not overcook the pretzel layer as it will get too hard and difficult to remove from the pan.

I left some of the pretzels in bigger chunks.  I don't recommend it.  I think I would have liked the crust better if they were all nearly a powder.  The chunks turn out chewy.  Otherwise it's a yummy dessert worth trying again sometime.

For a family potluck I doubled everything except the cream cheese layer(1 1/2x), and it filled my largest 11"x17" glass dish just right.  I was worried I might bring home half of it, because it was huge, but it disappeared, and people were scrambling to get the recipe. There were lots of salads, but one man said it was the best one on the table. It did take some calculations to get the liquid amounts right in the Jello layer.  For the double recipe I used 3 cups boiling water, one 16 oz. and one 24 oz. package of frozen strawberries. The total amount of that was 8 cups.  The Jello part could have been just a little less stiff, so next time, I think I'd add the full amount of water given in the recipe, OR add some fresh sliced strawberries (the fresh tend to add more liquid).  But this was a really good recipe, and I'm waiting now for several e-mails from the people who said they wanted the recipe  Thank you for this delicious and fun "salad".

This is tasty and easy.  It cuts beautifully, so the presentation is terrific, too.  The recipe I follow calls for two cups of pineapple juice heated to boiling to prepare the Jello layer instead of water. It adds a nice flavor.  I agree with other reviewers:  Do not overbake the crust.  Ten minutes is it!

Really good recipe!  I made this for a "retro" potluck and everyone raved.  The salty crunchy crust is a nice contrast to the cream cheese and strawberry toppings.  A few slight changes: I decreased the sugar in the cream cheese mixture to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I found the jello topping a little thick, next time I might add a little more than 2 cups of boiling water.  This was a fun recipe!

I made this for the first time today for a dinner party I hosted. Unfortunately, the directions to use a 9x13 pan didn't work out too well.  The pan was definitely not deep enough to hold the jello topping. I had to scoop it out of the pan and place in another dish in order for the entire jello mold to fit. So, point of the review is to make sure you have a deep enough dish for this! (It still tasted great, even though it didn't look as nice as I wanted it to)

This was a good recipe with a few minor adjustments. I cut back some on the sugar in the crust and adjusted the jello to two boxes instead of one. It was really good It is hard to keep around when people taste it. It can be somewhat rich so eat with caution.

this is really good. I love the salty/sweet combo and it's versatile, can be used with any flavor. I used orange and added mandarin oranges for Christmas and everyone loved it.

YUMMY!!!  Eveyone loved it.  I used kiwi/strawberry jello.  Next time I will make the crust a little thicker though.

I make this all the time, it is so good, even though the ingredients sound a little strange together.  I use only one package of cream cheese, and use raspberries and raspberry flavored gelatin, instead of the strawberry one.  If you are looking for something different to make for a group, this is a crowd pleaser, people always ask for this recipe when I take it places.

The only thing I would say is don't put too much sugar in the crust! It turns it into a rock if you do. I miss counted and added one extra. Even though we had a terrible time getting the crust out everyone LOVED this dessert!

Delicious!  I replaced half of the boiling water with juice I strained from the strawberries, and I actually used double the amount of strawberries called for in the jello to make it fruitier.  It was a big hit!

Update: Made this a second time and followed other reviewers' advice about letting strawberries/jell-o set a bit before pouring over cream cheese layer. Be warned that this is NOT the right choice for everyone! Mine set way too fast and was almost sturdy within about 20 minutes, so now the top layer is all lumpy and not smooth and pretty like it's supposed to be! If you're going to pre-set it, keep a VERY close eye on it and be aware of how high your fridge temp is too.

I haven't had this since I was a kid.  Last night I had a dinner for 8 people and was wondering what I could make for dessert, this recipe was in the daily recipes a few days prior and I couldn't wait to make it.  I followed everything prety much exact, but next time I would probably increase the pretzels to 2 cups to make the crust a bit thicker.  I think I also used more strawberries...I had a large bag that I use in smoothies and just pulled out a bowl full semi-thawed them since they were very large whole strawberries and I slicd them.  Thanks for sharing.

I took this to eating meeting at church and when one good ole boy saw that there wasn't much left he took the whole pan back to his table and ate what was left. I think that means it was real good.

I LOVED this recipe but I added a few twists to it. I made 2 cups of crushed pretzels and I added a cap of vanilla to the mix. also I reduced the sugar amount to 1/2 cup and added vanilla to that as well. This was gone in 2 days!We loved it!

Oh this is SOOOO GOOD!!!  I'm not a big fan of super sweet desserts, so I omitted the cup of sugar from the cream cheese.  Also, I used reduced fat cream cheese and 1/2 c margarine and 1/4 c butter.  I'd recommend making sure the cream cheese mix creates a seal between the pretzels an the jello b/c some of my jello did leak down and make the pretzels a little soggy.  But, it didn't really matter b/c it's SO tasty!!

I love this salad and it is a big hit with other people as well. I would suggest using a 1/2-1 cup extra pretzels for the crust so it is completely covered on the bottom. Also I used 2 boxes of jello instead of one and it makes it the layers more equal in amounts.

I really did like this salad, but it is a "stagey" project.  I also strongly suggest you crush the pretzels finely!  I didn't and that made for a mess.  (There was no question what my base layer was!)  :)

I know people love this stuff but it doesn't really do it for me.  I took it to a holiday gathering and most of it was uneaten.

In other words, good but not great.

This is a wonderful salad, but the next time I make it I will make it the night before so the pretzel crust isn't quite so hard.

The addition of frozen strawberries was simply awful. I think it's better to do without them, or very veery little of them. This dish is a bit over rated in my opinion. It was okay, not amazing, but not so bad as to not be edible. I won't be making this again.

Easy to make this a bit healthier: You could use sugar free jello, no sugar added strawberries, cool whip free, low-fat cream cheese and splenda instead of sugar in the crust and with the cream cheese. This was yummy and a big hit at a potluck - brought back a lot of memories for some of the more seasoned staff.

Make sure to use unsalted butter. I thought it was too much salt with both salted butter and pretzels. Otherwise a total hit.

I just made this today for Thanksgiving and it was WONDERFUL!!  I didn't make any variations, and it turned out great.  I was worried the crust may be too hard making it the same day as some of the other reviews said, but my crust turned out perfectly and wasn't too hard at all.  This recipe basically tasted like cheesecake with strawberries on top, but with a pretzel crust instead of graham cracker.  I may try making it with raspberries next time just for something different.  Definitley a keeper!!

Made this for a family reunion and there was none left at the end.  Everyone raved about it.  Used butter pretzels and it made it extra tastey.  Also used fresh strawberries instead of frozen and kept the 2 cups of water.  Did not have any problems with the layer of cream cheese and jello mixture while layering.  The only problem I had was with the crust.  I only kept it in the oven for 10 minutes but it was a bit hard to get out of the pan.  I was very surprised at how hard the pretzel layer was.  Maybe cutting down on the sugar some in the pretzel crust would make it not carmalize so much and become hard.  I don't think that it would make a difference in the taste; it is sweet enough and a couple of tbsp of sugar in the crust would not be missed.

Just what I was looking for, something cool for dessert. I didn't change anything and it was a hit in my house. It did take awhile to let all the layers cool, so if you are in a hurry choose a different dessert. It is best the next day.

This was yummy!  However no matter how many times I called it Strawberry pretzel salad, people would correct me and say it was more a dessert instead of a salad.   Well no matter where you sit it, on the salad table or the dessert table it will get eaten.

This recipe was delicious and a hit!  I used less water as other reviews said, and I used whole strawberries because that was all I could find.  Next time I would cut them up because they were sparse.

Very good recipe and was a great hit for our bbq party!  A couple revisions, though...Used probably 1 more cup of pretzels because there looked to be too much liquid in the pretzel crust, put 1 tsp. vanilla in the cream cheese mixture, and used 1 package of sliced fresh strawberries.

Too sugary and just kind of blah.  Might taste better if you used light cream cheese, light whipped topping, sugar free jello, and some powdered sugar in the cream cheese layer.

This was great! I made some changes though-I saw 2 recipes from this site-Pretzel Salad II and this one-I did, 3 c. pretzels,3 tblsp confect. sugar (for the crust instead of regular sugar) 1c of confect. sugar for the filling and I sliced fresh strawberries instead of using frozen. I made this for Easter and it was the first and only dish to go!!! Everyone wished I had made two of them!

This recipe is delicious!  I sprayed the bottom of the pan with nonstick spray after reading some other reviews and it made it easier to remove from the pan.  I also used cherry jell-o because that's what I had on hand.  I was very skeptical of this one and only tried it because it had so many reivews...it turned out great and I will make it many more times!

I have made this for years.  But I also only use 1 cup of water and let it set after adding the frozen strawberries for at least 10 minutes till it starts to jell.  Crushing the pretzels has been a family trick we now put them in empty cereal bags and step on them till they look like pecan pieces. Hope you enjoy this as much as we do.. Can be made sugar free and or fat free.

Good.  I'm not sure about the jello.  But, as soon as the cream cheese mixture hits my taste buds it seems to change my mind. :)

My sister-in-law makes this one.  Not my personal favorite.  For mine I melt the stick of butter(1/2C) in 350 degree oven in pan.  I crush the 1 cup pretzels with 1 cup sunflower seeds and 1 tbsp. sugar.  I press lightly in 9x11 baking pan. I press the cust lightly with fork for perfect texture when cutting. Cook 8 minutes.  
The Center I use is 1 C. Powdered sugar, 1 8oz cream cheese and 8oz cool whip, lowfat sometimes but never fat-free.  I use fresh or frozen berries depending on season.  The crust is the secret and crushing the pretzels.  I sometimes use extra jello and more fruit on the top.  I also have a recipe for an amish dessert that uses close to the same ingredients except the top is pudding instead of jello.  Cool whip to top.

This is one of my favorites!  I usually use a family recipe version but I couldn't find it, so I tried this one.  Not as good as my in-laws', but pretty dang close.  One trick is to add some crushed pinapple (drained) to the cream cheese layer and a little pinapple juice to the Jell-o to add a little flavor and texture.  Also, you can top with a layer Cool Whip.  Great treat!  Update: I have since tried the "Pretzel Salad" receipe and I think I like that one better than this one, some basic concept, though.

This is the classic pretzel salad recipe, seemingly most common in Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and that area of the country.  There it is often served as a side dish (in fact, in college it was usually on the salad bar).  Now we live in the South, and this is a largely unknown dish.  When taken to pot lucks here, it is usually treated as a dessert.

Excellent recipe!  Just the right proportions of everything!  Authentic pretzel salad - thanks, Judy!

Really is great tasting! Fun too. I do suggest fresh sliced strawberries for a much nicer look (maybe even lightly blanched).  The frozen berries taste great but do not look good. The are very dark and mushy looking in the jello.  I served this at a 4th of July Party and was a little embarrassed at the look of the berries. Bring recipe cards to give to people because they will ask for the recipe.

SO GOOD!   Company gave this great reviews and asked to make this allll the time.  I only used 1 pkg cr cheese and strawberry cool whip.  Also layred fresh strawberries on top of the creamy layer instead of frozen in with the jello.  OUTSTANDING

Addtion: I made again this time in cupcake cups for individual servings. This does not work the best. I also tried putting the jello layer in the middle. Also doesn't work well, as I'm sure others realize the jello completely encompasses the pretzel layer and takes away from it. Neither of these variations are recommendded. 
I really, really enjoyed this salad. I served it for dessert and used fresh strwberries instead of frozen. The pretzel crust is really yummy, it tastes like cookies! Next time I would definately spray the pan, a little hard to get out. I also think that next time I will put the cream cheese layer on the top. Highly recommended!

Great twist for stawberries.  The sweet and salt is a great combo. Be sure to spay pan, I can see how it would be hard to get out.  I found that the 9x13 pan was almost to full so I didn't use the entire amount of jello.  Like other I used fresh starwberries, and it was wonderful.  The pan was gone in no time.  Can't wait to try with fresh peaches!  Excellent!!!!!!!

This turned out TOO good. My husband even asked me not to make it again because he couldn't stop snacking on it (and he is not a dessert person.) 

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it turned out perfectly. It was pretty to present and quite tasty. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

**UPDATE: I tried this recipe again, but did not have the time to let the jello set, so I topped it with 2 cans of cherry pie filling instead. Still delicious.

I have made this a few times now and every time I make everyone loves it. The crust is suprisingly tastey. 

That said when I make it myself I put less gelatin on the top layer than it calls for and I cut the strawberries in half or thrids depending on the size.

I'll give it another five star rating, also.  Didn't have a whole lot of people try it since there were so many other, prettier desserts at the potluck, but those who did raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I followed recipe exactly, but did spray bottom with pam and followed another reviewers suggestion of spreading cream cheese layer to the edge so the jello stayed on top.  It took a little longer for mine to set so I had to pull it out early and it was perfect beacuse it hadn't gotten too "Jello Jigglerish" on the top, yet.

I like great recipes I can occasionally change up a little so this is 5 stars as is and fantastic too with the strawberry cool whip or I have also used the vanilla which is FANTASTIC.Great recipe also use any type of fruit/jello combo.Peach jello and frozen peach slices also superb.5 stars for taste and fun in playing with it.

This was really good, but I thought the jello layer was a bit "Jiggler"-ish.  Here's a tip - if you spread the cream cheese layer all the way to the edges of the pan, your jello won't soak through to the crust!  I didn't have a problem with the crust sticking or getting hard.  I read all the reviews before I made this and I have to say ~ just because it's called a salad doesn't mean you should slop it on a plate with a steak!  And, this is EASY to make.

I made this recipe for the first time for my son's boy scout meeting.  It was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it. The only changes that I made was I used raspberries and raspberry jello. I also used unsalted pretzels. Have made several times already and will continue to make.  Thanks so much.

This was the biggest hit at our 4th of July party this year!  I followed the directions to a T!  The only thing I would change for next time would be maybe to very lightly spray the pay with PAM and then I also may use real strawberries instead of the frozen ones.  I think the real key to this recipe is to allow time for the crust to cool completely before you add the rest so nothing gets soggy!

I love this recipe!  I only had a 10 ounce pkg of strawberries, so I used a can of strawberry pie filling along with the one bag of strawberries and it was still fantastic!  I took it to work and of course I had to copy the recipe for everyone.

I can't exactly call this a salad, but I definitely call it a winner!  I made this and took it to a bbq, it was gone in no time.  The only difference I would make (and due to my own error) is to use a food processor to crush the pretzels.  I wanted to leave some larger pieces as another reviewer suggested.  I like the idea...but I would say the biggest pieces should be no more than 1/2 an inch (my pieces were too big!). The crust still held together really well.  I also used one of those cheap disposable 9x13 (I hate keeping track of my pans away from home), and when transferring it to the fridge after adding the last layer the pan bent under the weight and sloshed strawberries all over the kitchen!  Will definitely place a cookie sheet under it for easier trasfer back and forth. Other than where the pan bent slightly and the jello mix slipped down the side to the pretzel crust, the crust was still crunchy 3 days later.  An excellent, excellent recipe!!!

Wow...was this ever yummy! I did make a few changes though. Instead of regular cool whip, I used the strawberry flavored and I did not do the whole jello thing. I followed the recipe exactly...except after I let the cool whip cream cheese mixture set...I just added sliced strawberries to the top and it was so, so good. I will be making this one again and again. Thank you Tom!

Wonderful! Everybody loved it. I have to admit that I wasn't sure whether or not it would be very good because I thought this combination of ingredients seemed strange, but it turned out great! I wish I would have used a bigger pan, though, because mine was kind of overflowing and it would have been nice to have even more of it.

Excellent recipe.  My family loved it.  The pretzel crust is wonderful.  I used no salt pretzels.  Next time I would use powdered sugar in the cream cheese mix instead of white sugar to avoid the grainy texture.  I was able to make two pies out of the amt. of cream cheese mix and the amt of strawberry mix that are called for on one.  I will make this again and my mom asked for the recipe.  I think the name should be changed....this is a pie.

Wow! This is great! I served it as a dessert, which is how I think its intended. I made my guests guess what was in the crust and they were shocked to find out it was pretzels! I have made this a few times now, and always use fresh sliced strawberries.

I made this to go with Christmas dinner this year and it was a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved it.  I think it can easily serve more than 8.  I had 11 for dinner and we had leftovers.  It is really good and could also be served as a dessert (as several people commented when they ate it).  Thanks!

Very Good!! Made for Thanksgiving, and whole family thought it was great.  I added two 10 0z. pkgs of strawberries instead, & also decreased water in jello by 1/3 cup, as I thought the juice from the strawberries would make up for the difference. Worked out great!! Will DEFINITELY make again many more times!!!

I have eaten this for years and years.  My mother made it for every thanksgiving.  I am grateful to finally have the recipe.  Now.  Yes this recipe takes time, YES you have to follow the directions, you must prebake the pretzel crust so it doesn't get soggy.  I will tell you my husband HATES strawberries but loves this.  I am making it again for Thanksgiving, even though I found out I will be cooking just for my family (4) I am not too bummed.  More leftovers for me.

I have made a recipe similar to this before but the top doesn't gel properly or the bottom gets too soggy...this was PERFECT!!!  I used only 1 1/2 cups of boiling water, two 10 oz. packs of strawberries and only one thing of cream cheese.  The recipe was sooooo good and the crust was so crunchy, I loved it!  Great recipe and am thankful I found it, there is a restaurant here in our town that serves this and now we have a similar recipe!  Thanks a bunch!

I had a problem with the jello setting up solid enough to move it to the party.  I made it the day before & when I removed it from the fridge, the jello layer started sliding off the cream cheese layer.  I think the problem was that I used sliced strawberries which may have had too much liquid in them for the jello to solidify.  So, my advice if you use sliced strawberries, is to use less water.  It tasted great, but the leftovers couldn't be saved because the pretzels were soaking in melted jello.

Wow!!! This was delicious.  I loved the salty sweet flavour of the crust.  For some reason my strawberries set the jello up too fast, so I ended up pureeing the mixture in the food processor and then pouring it on top of the cream cheese layer.  I think I liked it better this way...no lumpy, soggy strawberries. Will definately make this again.  mmm...

Wonderful recipe. I used salted, regular pretzels and salted butter. First I thought the crust would get too salty, but I went ahead and followed the recipe anyway, and it turned out great. I would not substiture unsalted butter or unsalted pretzels next time, the slightly salty and sweet flavor of the crust gives the salad a great contrast of flavors. I used raspberry jello and one and a half package of frozen raspberries instead of the strawberries. Everyone loved it.

I made this for a scrap book party that I had and everyone loved it!  The pretzel crust was the best!  I brought the leftovers to work three days later and it was as good as the first day.  I also sliced the strawberries before mixing them with the jello.  I would definitely consider this a dessert not a salad.

Very rich!  It would make a great pot-luck recipe.  I thought it was a bit more work than what I was looking for and found the pretzel crust to be too hard.  Flavors blended nicely though.

Everytime I looked someone had snuck some more.
Real butter with the pretzels really made for a yummy crust!

This is by far the best recipe I have tasted or used for pretzel salad. I have tried several, but the taste of this one is much better.

This was on my recent salad bar buffet. The ladies all seemed to enjoy it. But didn't get rave reviews as some of the others from this site. It could be because I sub'd sour cream for half the cool whip and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. It was still pretty sweet. Thanks Tom.

Absolutely delicious.  I'm not sure this should be considered a salad as it makes a great dessert as well.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I made two boxes of strawberry jello because I didn't think there was enough with just one.  The mixture of salty pretzels and the sweetness of the creamy mixture and jello with strawberries surprisingly complimented each other.I will definately make this again.

I wasn't sure how crushed the pretzels should be so I crushed them into 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces.  They kind of take on a nutty taste in the salad and the salt and sugar compliment each other well.  I made this about 7 hours before it was served and it was great.

Very good. I liked the pretzels. That would be an interesting crust to try with other things. It was gone in 10 minutes when I brought it to work. The topping was not my favorite, but it was a hit!

This was just the recipe I was looking for.  Took some patience waiting for each layer to set up, but well worth it in the end.  I will be adding this to my Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners to come.

I had seen this dessert at many potluck picnics, but hadn't found the recipe.  It was very good.  It will be a good summer-time dish.  Next time, I'll add a layer of Cool Whip on top with a strawberry garnish as someone else suggested.

I had this recipe back in college and loved it.  I have been searching for the recipe for months and finally found it here, it is as great as I remeber.  My 3 1/2 year old who will never try anything loved it (of course- it is really a dessert)!
I highly recommend this!

My entire family loved this recipe!!  We tried it in the middle of winter and I'm not sure we can wait until summer to try it again!! Although I'm dying to try it with fresh strawberries instead of frozen.

This is a wonderful, year round dessert. When my sweet tooth is really acting up, I use ! more package of cream cheese, 1/3 cup more sugar, and a large bowl of whipped topping. You need a deeper pan, but that middle layer is the bomb diggity for me. Otherwise, this dessert is perfect following the recipe exactly.

Made it exactly as instructed but as several reviewers suggested, I put the jell-o strawberry mixture in the fridge while the cream cheese was setting in the freezer...but the jell-o strawberry mixture was almost set and didn't really pour, I spread it over the cream cheese mixt.  I won't do that next time.  Nonetheless, it was still fabulous and the entire family loved it!

The pretzels would not get crispy they stayed soggy , the cream cheese and whipped filling didn't taste as good as I expected.  My grandma makes this dessert  and it is awesome , I am not sure how her recipe differs from this one but I would not make this version again.

It was Loved by everyone! I did one cream cheese like I was making refrigerator cheesecake. The other cream cheese I did as the recipe called for. I already had chopped up strawberries, with some sweetening I added 1 tsp of vanilla to them and 2 tblsp of instant clear jel after I did the jello, because the berries were really juicy. It was outrageously delicious!!!

I made it for a church BBQ, and never did get to sample it, but it did not make an appetizing appearance.  The frozen strawberries I used couldn't nearly be covered by the amount of Jello. 
 Also, after chilling it overnight the Jello had partially turned watery.  If I try it again I will use fresh strawberries and slice them first so they are easier to cover with the Jello.  Would also add a 3 oz. box of Jello along with the 6 0z.  I think the recipe has possibilities with these changes.

I can remember when this recipe first came out.  Every party served it and there was never any left overs.  This is my go to summer dessert.  Through the years I have learned a few things for easier completion.  You do not have to bake the crust.  Using a large skillet melt butter and sugar then add pretzels. cook a few minutes stirring. dump into pan.  Be sure to chill the cream cheese layer.  After making the jello chill in refrigerator,then pour over cream cheese layer.  This prevents seeping into the cream cheese.  The last thing I do now is use fresh strawberries or frozen whole berries sliced.  The flavor is amazing and so fresh.  If you have never tried this, you don't know what you are missing.

This is my go to dish to make when having a party or going to one. Family always requests it. Make sure you give the salad plenty of time to set or it can get messy. Over time, I've increased the amount of pretzels used as I like a little bit of a thicker crust.

A go to recipe that we make at least once every holiday season.  Kids absolutely love it!  Do not over bake crust or it is rock solid hard.

This always turns out great when I follow suggestions from  a previous review:
1) instead of using 2 cups of water, use 1 cup of boiling water to dissolve the package of gelatin, then add 3/4 cup strawberry juice/syrup, and then add the strawberries; and 2)put the gelatin/strawberry mixture in the fridge for about an hour or so to thicken a bit before pouring it overtop of the cream cheese mixture (this is very key for the success of the dessert).
Also, don't over bake pretzels!!!

Fabulous! Simply fabulous! Easy to make, rich glowing taste, and any type of crowds pleaser. It is like old-fashioned Paps&Moms dessert with modern edgy twist!
I did some slight changes: 1) I replaced butter with organic coconut oil (for the health benefits and love of taste). 2) reduced water amount in half (one glass). 3)  used fresh strawberries. 4) as Lynde suggested, baked the crust not longer than 10 mins. 
Next time, for the same amount of cream cheese, I will use 2 packages of strawberry gelatin, will increase amount of fresh strawberries, and probably will add organic strawberry preserve. 
I think I will also try to make as mini cheese-cake version. It will look outstanding on the table.

This is a great recipe and people love it, but it is very time consuming.  Make it the night before you need to have it, and make sure you let each layer cool completely in the refrigerator.  I also let the jello layer set in the fridge about half hour before pouring it over the cream cheese layer, it helps to keep them separated because you don't want the jello dripping into the cream cheese.

This was a huge hit with the family, delicious and easy as is, with the exception of doubling the amount of jello.  As another reviewer indicated, do not bake the crust more than 10 minutes and remember to let your jello chill a bit before adding it to the cream cheese mixture. This will become a holiday staple at our home!

I love this recipe when my Aunt makes it.  As for me, I have not had it work 2 years in a row.  I seem to get more juice than strawberries in the frozen ones and I used 1/2 the water to compensate and it still didn't work.  I think I may give up.  I am not so sure it is the recipe because it works for others.  I love the taste, even with soupy strawberry topping.

This was so delish!! I don't like jello so I just put fresh fruit on top and it was so good (even without the fuit on top, still good). I did follow the advice and not let the pretzel base cook too long.  Great recipe!

Love this, though second time I made it I made more crust as I didn't think it was enough the first time.  The pan was very full!  Holds well and is a great dessert.

This is just too awesome for words.  I don't like the taste of frozen strawberries, so I always use fresh.  The crust is definitely hard, but who cares, it tastes great!

Recipe is great although I made some changes. I used 1 cup boiling water and 20 ounces of frozen strawberries. For an extra added kick and texture put a handful of ground up walnuts in the pretzel mixture it makes it even that more special.

This wasn't too bad. I didn't like the pretzel bottom, and it seemed too sweet overall. I think a graham crust would have been better. Still it's an interesting and easy recipe - worth tinkering with a bit.

One of our holiday family favorites.  We DO bake the pretzel ingredients for 15 minutes on a cookie sheet.  Don't press it down, 
then break into pieces while it cools.

Layer the salad in a sprayed Bundt pan to be inverted when ready to serve
One cup pretzel mix as a base, then half of the jello mix.  Cool slightly.  Spoon the cream cheese mixture over, carefully add the rest of the jello mixture.  Top with remaining pretzel mixture.

Invert by warming the outside of the Bundt pan with a warm hand towel,
then put a serving platter on top and tip at once to invert the molded salad.

I make this every time we have a family gathering or I go somewhere I need to bring a dessert. It's FANTASTIC! My family goes nuts for it and always requests it. It's good with or without sliced strawberries and with other flavors of jello too. The only thing I change is I make a bit more of the crust (usually 1.5) just because I like a bit more crust. This is a delicious recipe, easy and always a huge hit!

I've made this many times, and my husband and I are huge fans. I under-bake the crust by a couple minutes, otherwise it can be difficult to cut through. I always use reduced fat cream cheese and whipped topping. I usually add 1/2 cup of thinly sliced fresh strawberries, since the bags of frozen strawberries are mostly sauce. We love this dessert!

This is absolutely delish!!!  I went on what others recommended and only baked the crust for 10 minutes, and also only used one block of cream cheese.  Another thing I did was once I had the strawberry's in the hot water with the Jello, I took my potato masher and smashed down the strawberry's, so they would evenly distributed across the dish.  I'm ashamed to say I had 2...yes, 2 pieces!!!  I'll definitely be making this for the upcoming holiday's!

This salad is delicious! I've served this for Christmas dinner for the last several years and everyone loves it. For a change, I sometimes substitute the strawberry ingredients for raspberries.

This was great!! I followed others advice to let the jello set up some and I had no problem with it seeping into the cream cheese layer- it actually kinda seemed to slip off the cream cheese layer when I cut it but it didn't matter, taste definitely ruled over that problem. I also used fresh strawberries and light cream cheese

This is a family favorite that is a "must have" at every holiday!  Before my mother-in-law passed away she wrote down this recipe and every time I make it, I think of her.  Coincidentally, her name was Judy too!

yes this recipe is for sure a keeper. Its great for a dessert, and a salad. I get great comments when I make it. I double the crust mix, and add a smidge less water to the jello. Also, do not pour the unset jello over top of the pretzels!!! It will not be a nice layered look. Wait till it sets about half way in the fridge. I add any kind of fruit available.

Hubs and I wanted something sweet. Since we were on "dessert overload" from the holidays, I thought I'd try this since jello with fruit sounded refreshing. I used Birds Eye frozen strawberry slices that were beautiful.  It turned out delicious!

Pretzel salad has always been a favorite at our house.  This version is no exception.  I made this for our office Christmas luncheon, where some people had never had it before.  So that I could have a pretty presentation, I made it in my springform pan rather than a 13 x 9.  While it did present well, after it is cut for a while, the weight of the uncut portion that was next to cut portion started to separate.  When making this again, if I know it will all be eaten in the first setting, I would make it in the springform pan again.  If I know I will be having leftovers, I will make in a 13 x 9 pan.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it was a hit with everyone.

I love this recipe, but my husband doesn't like chunks of strawberries, so for the top layer I put a large handful of fresh strawberries into my blender. Then I made the jello packet with 1 cup boiling water and added that to the blender.  Lastly, I added 1 cup of raspberry sherbert.  Blend & pour over cream cheese mixture. AWESOME!!

Our family has been eating this salad for years and it is one of our favorites. It's easy to make, presents beautifully and everyone smiles when I put it on the table. It serves well with any kind of meat as a side dish during a meal or after as a dessert. I like to use a 9 X 13 glass dish to make it so everyone can see the lovely layers. Everyone should try this sweet and salty dish.

Super yummy.  Followed previous ratings and made the jello and let if cool a bit in the frig before adding fresh strawberries.  It does take a little longer to make then the recipe states.

I have made this a couple of times and everyone loves it and wants the recipe.  I did cut sugar by half as other reviewers recommended.  I also used fresh strawberries.  Makes a wonderful potluck dessert and no one can figure out the crust is made with pretzels but they love it.

Besides the fact that the pretzels stuck to my pan, they really didn't add anything to the other ingredients.  I think the topping would be great with something else.  I'll try pairing this with a plain cake next time in place of icing.

I made this for a family gathering on the 4th. The cream cheese layer  turned out too thick(IMO)and the pretzel layer was soft.I was very disappointed. I baked the crust exactly 10 minutes and let it cool. After spreading the cream cheese layer I let it set in the fridge 30 minutes to cool. I made the jello layer and let it set about 40 minutes before adding it. I'm not sure what I did wrong but i know that this can be a delicious dish.

Perfect! Thanks for sharing! This recipe uses the Jell-o to "hold it together"... instead of the dry pretzels... this was wonderful! I have already made it 4 times!!!

Wasn't a fan of the pretzel crust, would have preferred graham cracker crust.  The filling and strawberry layer were wonderful though.

This is absolutely delicious! I made a half batch for mother's day and my mom loved it. I did make a full crust recipe because we really like the crust. I used 16 oz. frozen strawberries because that's the smallest package I could find and we're strawberry lovers. And I added a splash of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.

Love It. I have made this countless times, I like cutting the strawberries in small cubes and saving the best to slice to put on top for presentation (cuts easier) I agree with all other, don't over cook the pretzel crust, it will be too hard to cut ;)

Made this for Christmas 2012 and it was a HIT! My family said it tastes like a Good Humor Strawberry Shortcake bar. Stuffed after dinner, people still went back for a second piece of this. I made the Jello first. Dissolved sugar-free strawberry Jello in a cup of boiling water. Added ice to measure 2 cups and stirred until melted. Poured this into my food processor and added a package of frozen strawberries. Processed until well blended. This MADE the recipe. The Jello wasn't ordinary Jello, it was more of a strawberry topping. After the crust was baked and cooled a bit, I put on the cream cheese layer. Then went to pour on the Jello, but it was solidified, so a quick whir in the food processor fixed this. Pour on the Jello and covered to chill. A family favorite!

I'm debating on whether this is worth attempting again. Being a cheesecake lover, I think I expected more flavor from the filling. Also, I baked the crust for 10 minutes and it was hard to cut through. The topping I loved, but I felt like it needed more jello and strawberries and the strawberries need to be sliced!! Mine kept sliding off. This may be a keeper for a potluck, though.

SOooooo good!  Used no fat cream cheese and whipped topping, and fake butter.  I found that the gelatin was too much for the pie pan and it spilled over and was quite messy.  But it was worth it!:)  Great recipe.

Wow do I love this recipe!  It always impresses guests and there are never any leftovers!  I used blueberries with strawberry jello which made it very patriotic looking.  I also used the tip from other reviewers to refrigerate the jello mixture before adding to the dish.  If you are using frozen fruit don't chill for longer than an hour or you will have a big bowl of fruity jello!

I have made this for my family several times. Each time they rave about how good it is. Something about the saltiness of the pretzels and the sweetness of the jello make's is such a unique combo.  I use frozen strawberries, and blend them together with the jello in my blender. Doing this adds a bit more frothiness, just be careful o hold the lid down on the blender tightly.

this recipe is fantastic! The only thing I did different was double the jello b/c I can't get enough of it ;) and I didn't leave it in the fridge too long since that makes the pretzels soggy. My family constantly requests this dish for gatherings and holiday parties. Love this dish!

Even my finicky nephew liked this salad!  Utilized a couple of tips, and it turned out perfect: Sprayed pan prior to pretzel layer; Baked the pretzel layer for 10 min only; Doubled amt. of jello packets and water; Added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to cream cheese layer.  Next time would try to slice strawberries first, or use pre-sliced. Will make again!

Addition 12/22/10:   I did add an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cups more of the crushed pretzels for the crust.   It helped to cover the 9x13 pan.  One of my all time favorites!   Great for potlucks...people always love it.

This recipe is good and many of my family members love it.  I happen to remove some of the sugar content though because it was so sweet I couldn't really enjoy it.  I also switched out the sugar for splenda and used less butter for the pretzel crust as well.

I made this for a get together last night.  It turned out really good.  The only thing I had a problem with was that when I patted the crust out in the 9x13 pan it didn't fill up the pan.  So I transferred it to a 7x11 pan and after I added the filling I hardly had room for the topping.  Next time I'm going to double the crust so I can use the bigger size pan.

This dish was crazy rich, but delicious!  I too used a spring form pan and the presentation was beautiful, just like the picture.  I received many compliments on this at the church dinner that I took it to.  Thanks Judy, I'll be making this again!

I was SO hungry for this but never made it myself! Four ladies in my fraternal group make this for our refreshments and we all love it. I was looking forward to last month's meeting because they would be serving this and it SNOWED!!! So I made this over the weekend and it turned out so good and very easy. Just a bit time consuming between each layer but so worth it! I did take the advise of another reviewer and doubled the jello which was perfect with the amount of cream cheese mixture. Will make it again and will experiment with lime jello & pineapple chunks or orange jello & mandrian oranges. YUM!

Every single person at my work came up to me to tell me how great this dish was! They begged for the recipe. I made it again at home and my husband ate the whole pan. I used sliced strawberries (in a tub in the frozen section) instead. My only complaint-and its not really a complaint- is that the crust gets so incredibly hard that you need a chisel to get it out of the pan. :-)

I made the following substitutions: 2 packages of lowfat cream cheese and I used 1 cup of splenda in the cream cheese layer. I also followed the advice of others and let the gelatin set up for a few hours before adding it to the cream cheese layer. Delicious! I got rave reviews at the Christmas potluck I took it to! Will definitely make again and again

The only thing I found w/ this recipe is that the amount of pretzels wasn't enough for me, so I upped it to 2 cups. Otherwise, it was excellent!

This is a TERRIFIC and unique dish to take to any spring or summer potluck! The important tricks here: using the filling layer to completely seal off the pretzel layer, and using a DEEP 13x9 PAN...the utter deliciousness was in danger of overflowing my 13x9 casserole with sloped sides. For those reviewers who complained the amount of pretzels was insufficient, I think they should have measured them after they were crushed. Absolutely wonderful just as written!

This is delicious and easy to make.  I mix any flavors of red gelatin that I have on hand, and use three 3 ounce boxes.  I also like it better without strawberries!  Another reviewer's suggestion to chill the gelatin for 30 - 45 minutes before pouring over the cream cheese layer is right on!

I found this and it's been a hit..  Every family get together I'm asked to make this...  The kids love it and us big people sneak back in for seconds ..yum yum..  I like this because it's sweet and salty yet not like eating a big bit of cool whip.  We have a nut allergy in the family so this adds a bit of bar or nut flavor with out the nuts..

Tasted great. I waited for the jello to chill about 15 mins before pouring over top and my jello still ended up running through  to the bottom. I'll have to figure out how to make that last layer work properly, but otherwise great.

This was delicious. I used Black Cherry jello and frozen mixed fruit (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries).  It was a hit!! It was easy to make, and a light dessert.  Everyone really enjoyed this.  I would definitely make this again.

Definitely the best!  Exactly the recipe I was looking for, and extremely easy!  I made this for 4th of July dinner with Red, White & Blue layers by adding food color to half of the cream cheese filling.  THANKS!

Delicious!  I was worried because I'm not a jello fan, but the jello layer was wonderful...not at all like jello when you add the sliced strawberries!  I used frozen sliced in sugar.  The pretzel layer was very tasty...a nice change from a cookie or graham crust.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

A very nice refreshing dessert for summer.  I misjudged and overcooked the crust slightly. Next time I will adhere to the 10 minutes the recipe recommended.

Update 4.4.10-I have made this tons of times and love the sweet salty combo.  

To make a 9x9 pan with fresh strawberries-Made crust increasing pretzels to 2c and reduced butter to 1 stick-baked 10 min. Reduced cream cheese mixture by half the recipe as written. For top layer slice 8oz of strawberries and refrigerate with 2 tablespoons of splenda one hour. Spoon berries evenly on top before poring jello mix on top.  Used sm 3oz wild strawberry jello-dissoved with 1 cup boiling water and added just enough ice cubes to cool.

Like many others, I too let my jello/strawberry mixture cool and set-up for an hour or so before adding. This really did make a huge improvement from the first time I made it! Delicious and never any leftovers!

This recipe is a family favorite.  We make it for every holiday gathering and have for years.  I throw 1/2 cup of pecans into the crust.  However, I don't put any sugar in the crust.  I use 3/4 cup sugar in the cream cheese layer. And I use a 16 oz. container of frozen strawberries with juice for the top.  It is fabulous!

Always a crowd pleaser!  When making this, make sure you let each layer cool and set before adding the next layer.

WOW, what a huge hit!  Nothing was left and most had seconds and thirds!  I added a small can of crushed pineapples & that was all I changed.  I did take the advise of one reviewer and let the jello sit for a hour before layering it.  I cooked the pretzel crust in a pan and transferred it into a footed glass trifle bowl (do this while its warm and let it cool in the bowl) then continued with the layers-what a great presentation!!
I only gave it 4 stars because the pretzel crust was extremely hard and I had to chop it up to serve it (not that anyone minded).  I will definately try and let it sit overnight as another reviewer suggested.  I also suggest making it way ahead as the jello takes quite a while to set (maybe because of the crushed pineapple?).

This is wonderful, served it at a family gathering, and it was enjoyed by all.   A little hint, you may want to grease bottom of pan, as my pretzel crust got stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Very Yummy and refreshing.

Really delicious at every stage of making it... but def. remember to let the crust cool before adding the creamy middle.

Also... refrigerate the jello a bit before adding it to the top of dessert--we had the experience of it seeping down to the bottom layer and forming a totally new layer of jello at the bottom. Still delicious but not as pretty :)

Oh so yummy. I like strawberry jello but not actual strawberries, so used two boxes of the jello and left out the strawberries and it was very good.

This was awesome- exactly what I expected. Following the recommendations of other reviewers, I used one cup of boiling water to dissolve the Jello. I strained the juice from the strawberries into a measuring cup and found I had just enough. I wanted more strawberries, so I sliced up some whole frozen berries (they cut very easily while frozen), and mixed all the berries into the Jello. I refrigerated that for about 20 minutes before pouring it onto the cream cheese layer. I did make it 24 hours before serving to allow the pretzel crust to soften up a bit, as suggested. Delicious!

I used crushed pecans instead of pretzels. It was delicious, but not as firm as it needed to be. I didn't let the pecan crust cool enough before adding the next layers.

The pretzel crust was great, but the cream cheese layer was extremely sweet.  This was too rich for me and the kids wouldn't eat it (!).  I might try this again and use Splenda instead of white sugar to see how it turns out.  It did not keep well in the fridge overnight.

I don't know if this can be called a salad or a dessert but it was fabulous! Every bit as decadent as strawberry cheesecake! The family loved it but I think I loved it the best. I had no changes to make to this recipe since it came out perfect. Thanks for the great dessert..err...salad!

This is yummy and always so popular. Some people find it too sweet for a salad and comment that it's a better dessert. I think it depends on how "sophisticated" your group is, but it can be nice to balance out the veggies, potatoes, etc.

This was just average good. My pretzels seemed a little soggy to me. I would've liked my crust a little 'crunchier'.

Increased the pretzels to 2 cups, decreased the cream cheese to 1 pkg, and used 2 pkgs of strawberries and it was great. But only 4 stars as written.

I had previously made one of the other "strawberry pretzel salads" and my DH didn't like it at all.  So thought I'd try this one with another reviewer's suggestion of peaches/peach jello.  And boy was it YUMMY!!  My DH couldn't get enough of it!  I will use this recipe again and try it with the strawberries and his favorite Raspberries!  Thanks Judy!!

This is definitely the best recipe I've tried for this dessert. I did read reviews and used brown sugar in the crust and loved it. I did however have to double the strawberry layer because it should be the same amount as cream cheese layer. Definitely reduce the boiling water by at least a half cup. thanks for a wonderful recipe

I think you need to either increase the pretzel amount or decrease the amount of butter for this recipe.  I ended using 2 1/2 cups pretzels after my first crust came out liquidized and pretzels floating around.   The only other change in ingredients I made was throwing in some blueberries just for the color since it's the Fourth of July.  I followed other reviewers suggestion and let the jello set up for 30 minutes prior to putting it on the cream cheese layer.  Also, due to time restrictions, I put the crust in the freezer while I made the cream cheese layer, which let it harden and the cream cheese went on smoothly.  I put it back in the freezer while the jello set up in the refrigerator, and the cream cheese was slightly hard which allowed the jello to go on smooth and not move the cream cheese around.  This dessert went over very well at the office party - I was suprised that even the men liked it.

I couldn't give this recipe a "5" because this isn't the recipe that I regularly use, but I still feel that this is a great 'sweet & salty' treat. I made this for a 4th of July get-together. To decorate the top, instead of doing the usual American flag thing (with blueberries/strawberries/cool whip), I made another batch of the cream cheese filling, but with a bit more Cool Whip. With this, I made polka-dots on top of the dessert with a pastry bag and placed a blueberry on top of that. It turned out pretty cute, and tasted wonderful! :)

Really good!  I have heard of this "salad" before but have never made it.  I made it for a get-together with friends and no one had ever heard of it before but they loved it!  It quickly disappeared!

This jello salad is a staple in my hometown in western PA, showing up as a side dish at every family function, but surprisingly few people here in my new home of Columbus, Ohio were familiar with it. This recipe is the best I have ever come across and has been a HUGE hit every time I make it.  My Georgia-born hubby had never heard of such a thing when I first made it for him and now he begs me to make it! Anything that gets him to praise my culinary skills deserves 5 stars..a nd then some! :-)

I made this last night for a night of playing cards with the family.  I was SOOO leary of it at first, thinking it was going to be a flop.  But my brother and his fiance took a bite and kinda smirked, which i thought was a bad look or response, then my brother said "This is the bomb!!"  LOL  Everyone loved it.  The salty and sweet combo is fantastic.  The only thing I didnt like personally is the feeling of jiggly jello in my mouth.  I dont like that at all.  So maybe next time i will just use crushed strawberries and slather the top with that.  My family also said how it may be REALLY good with peaches and peach jello.  So, this is a great recipe to use as a base and really experiment with.  Becareful not to burn or OVER toast the pretzel layer.  And i was thinking, maybe to try brown sugar with the crust and not white.  It may melt into the butter and pretzel more and not be as gritty.

Oh, this is just awesome. I make this a lot when I have to take a dessert somewhere...it's so yummy!! I like to bake my crust about five minutes longer, just so it will be nice and crunchy. Just the right combination of salty and sweet!

This is a family favorite although we make ours with 1/2 cup brown sugar in the crust instead of the white sugar called for in this recipe.  Also, how can anyone not like the crust??  The salty sweet crunchy combo is the best part of the dessert!  Watch out doubling the crust though.  I did that once & must have overbaked it a little.  It got so hard, we could not get it out of the pan and had to eat just the topping - I didn't make it for 2 years after that happened!

Oh wow! Wooow! This is so-o delish! Double the crust for sure! I did a .6oz pkg of strawberry jello & a .3oz pkg raspberry jello without changing the boiling H2O amount. Both were sugar free since that's all we had - but it came out great!!! I couldn't tell a difference. It's about midnight here & my mom & I were just in the kitchen eating it straight from the pan!! we couldn't stop! haha! these flavors go sooo well together. The saltyness and sweetness are amazing. Gotta try it!

Always a hit, I make this recipe at least once or twice a year.  Making it for a Christmas party this weekend, the combo of sweet and salty is heavenly.  I always use sugar free jello, low fat cream cheese, and light cool whip.

I tried this because of the great reviews. The crust is excellent and I will use it again. I also liked the cream cheese filling, but we did not like the strawberry gelatin topping at all. To me (and my husband as well) the gelatin flavor & texture just didn't go with the creamy filling.

I just made this recipe for a party last weekend and it was a hit! I forgot to add the whip cream to the cream cheese, but added it on top! It was STILL delicious and EVERYONE asked me for the recipe. I'm making it again for another party we're having this coming weekend. Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect, and everyone wanted the recipe!  I've already forwarded it on to some friends as a "must try."

Somehow I missed the step of mixing in the Cool Whip so I served it on the side.  Ended up tasting like cheesecake (with a delicious, salty crust).  Beware:  I was probably too impatient with thawing the strawberries and the jello turned out very runny.  Halfed the recipe -- enough for 8.

This recipe is awesome. Everyone at the end of school picnic begged for the recipe. I have since tried another variation, raspeberry jello with raspberrys was good too. Thank Judy for the great recipe!

This was a great recipe--definitely a keeper. I modified the crust by adding 1 1/2 cups of ground pecans. Also, I used fresh strawberries, putting them in when the jello had cooled.

Pretty good, although I may like it better the lighter version using only one block of cream cheese.  Also, read the directions, as I thawed the strawberries and you are not supposed to.  Thus my layers sort of combined when I added the warm jello mixture on top of the cream cheese layer.

I made this on Saturday for a get-together with an old friend. Both her family and my family loved it. I increased the crushed pretzels b/c the recipe's recommendation didn't cover the bottom of my dish. I was also in a hurry and didn't make everything level so some of the jello was thicker on one side than on the other. I would recommend doubling the frozen strawberries as well.

This was very good. I made it for Thanksgiving and received lots of compliments. I sliced the frozen strawberries in half so they'd sit better in the jello. Great recipe!

This has been a family favorite for years, but it was my first time making it.  Other than it being rather time consuming, it was easy to make and tastes terrific!  We're still enjoying the leftovers.  Thanks, Tom!

If it weren't for the misleading name I never would have found this recipe. It was definitely a sweet surprise. This really should be categorized under Best Desserts Ever and not Salads. This was simply wonderful. It's all about the pretzel crust and the cream cheese filling! Thank you!

Have made this numerous times, as it is the one recipe I get more requests for, above all others.

making it today as a matter of fact, for our July 4 BBQ ( on the 2nd ;) ). Think I might dot the top with some whipped cream and plop some fresh blueberries on that to make it festive for the day!!

Very tasty! I was unsure about this recipe but tried it anyway. This is so delicious! My husband said this is his hands down favorite dessert! I might mess around with the Jello topping, maybe try a typical cheescake topping, even though my husband says don't change a thing. I'm personally not to fond of Jello, but the pretzel crust is amazing...so good, but just crumble the pretzels nut totally crush.

Wow! What a hit! I took this to a family gathering today, and got rave reviews.  Everyone loved the pretzel crust! Due to the excessive juice in the frozen/sliced strawberries, I drained them, and even ended up adding more berries.  I used one pkg of cream cheese, and 8 oz strawberry flavored cream cheese spread.  Following another review, I made the jello ahead of time (used 1 cup berry juice in place of cold water), and added the berries when slightly set.  Next time I will make this the night before, as it was a bit time consuming.  Well worth it, though! This is a keeper!

Ok I have made this before, and for some reason this time the gelatin fell to the bottom. It looked icky and tasted mushy. Maybe 30 minutes isnt enough to set it?

Great!! My whole family loves it. My preschoolers like the sweet strawberries and jello layer, my husband and teen like the smooth cream cheese layer and i like the salty sweet baked pretzel layer that's still wonderfully crunchy the next day. It's a keeper. A hint i've found to the crust is not to crush the pretzels too fine. Leave them at a chopped consistency and the crust wont be as hard.

Wonderful! What a treat! I made exactly as specified and wouldn't change anything! My husband LOVES anything with cream cheese, so this was a big hit! Easy to make. I used a 16oz container of frozen, sliced strawberries - syrup and all and the taste was well worth it!

I'm giving this 5 stars for the taste.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but for whatever reason, the gelatin didn't set up as firm as the one I had at a family barbeque.  Guess I'll have to ask my mother-in-law to ask her friend for her recipe. :(

This was yummy and does remind you of cheesecake.  My picky husband ate several servings - believe me, that says a lot!  I didn't change and thing and wouldn't change a thing.  Nuf' said!

I made this w/o the Jello. (I'm not a jello fan and it didn't look like it was going to gel). It was very good otherwise. It might be something to experiment with to make a cheese cake.

Made the first time Christmas.  Excellent!  Changed the ingredients a bit, 1/2 cup butter, fat free cream cheese, sugar free jello and 1 3/4 cup water.  Placed jello, strawberry mixture in fridge to firm up a bit before layering on top.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this twice and it was delicious both times!  I actually used half regular sugar and half brown sugar and it turned out great!  This is an excellent dish to make for company luncheons or holiday dinners.

The pretzels kept throwing me off and also were very soggy from the jello running through. I think I'll use grahm crackers next time or nilla wafers.

One of my favorite summer treats. Had this many years ago at my mother-in-laws, but the recipes was lost! It is simply one of my favorites. I make this all the time and it is always requested! I double the pretzel crust, but other than that have made no changes. Thanks for sharing Judy!

Very tasty! I recommend not over packing the crust, because it makes it very difficult to cut the finished product.

I just went to a meeting with about 40 ladies and took about 6 strawberry dishes.  This one went first and everyone was ga-ga over it.  Its a definite keeper!  Give the jello a little bit longer time to firm up though.

MMMmmm.  So good, I had to get it out of my house!  Many steps, but simple to prepare.  I used cherry jello and a can of cherry pie filling because that was what I had on hand.  Excellent!

This is awesome and totally addictive.  One thing that I did differently:  removed half of the cream cheese mixture.  It was just too much, and it turned out perfect when I took some out.  Also, next time I will do something different with the crust.  It was like cutting into a brick.  I don't know why it turned out so hard, but I will be adjusting that part next time.  Overall, the taste was truly delicious--plus, it's so simple!

Excellent!  Very easy to make, very tasty and everyone raved about it.  The only trouble I had was that my whole strawberries (frozen) were too big. The next time I would look for sliced ones - or smaller type berries (maybe not strawberries). I will definitely be making this one again.

This turned out Wonderfully!! everyone loved it.  I tried to make it as "light" as possible (sugar free jello, light cool-whip, light cream cheese) and it was still a huge hit.  I think next time I'll try a different flavor of Jello and use some frozen mixed berries (rasberry/blackberry)... my frozen strawberries seemed to be high on "juice" but low on actually strawberries.  Next time I'm going to get the "whole" berries and slice them myself.
thanks! - a Huge hit with the whole family!

Excellent combination of flavors.  I used 2 cups worth of chopped pretzels so that there would be enough to cover the bottom of the pan.  Everything worked out perfectly and we all enjoyed this.  Will make this colorful "salad" (or rather, dessert) for the upcoming holidays.

I have made this salad repeatedly and it continues to be one of my favorite jello salad recipes. The crust is what adds to the great taste.

Very delicious.  I believe I have seen a similar recipe with sour cream instead of cream cheese, that is just as good.

I made this for my son's Christening and everyone loved it!  My father-in-law liked it so much that my mother-in-law asked for the recipe.  People commented that the strawberry layer tasted like candy, I thought it tasted like fresh strawberry preserves.  The whole dish was like a light fluffy cheesecake, and the pretzel crust was the best part.

AWESOME! Best new recipe I have made in a long time!  My entire family loved it, I was suprised that even the following day the pretzel crust was still crunchy (I didn't crush them so much as to make crumbs, just small pieces of pretzels). Can't say enough - absolutely wonderful!

This is a delicious recipe!  It's very refreshing!  I had actually made it for Christmas Day (because I wanted something red) and I sure am glad I did.  It was wonderful!  The pretzel crust is really different and it just makes the recipe.  I just crushed the pretzels in a ziploc bag and it worked great!  I'll definetely be making this again for our July 4th barbecue.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I changed it a little, though as I had frozen blackberries and used raspberry jello.  I found the pretzels difficult to crush...maybe it was the brand.

My mother-in-law makes this and I have to say mine, following this recipe was better.  I did add some extra sliced, fresh strawberries to the jello.  It is a fun combination of flavors and a nice refreshing summer dessert.

Found this recipe by mistake and made it for my co-workers.  They LOVED it!  It was a big hit.  I, however, found the results to be revoltingly sweet with a weird texture difference between the slightly soft pretzel, creamy middle and jelly-like strawberry topping.  To each his own.

Anyone will love this.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was great.  I also cut down the sugar.  You must used frozen strawberries to thicken the jello but then I supplemented with chopped fresh strawberries on top it it turned out great.  Excellent make-ahead dessert.

Very good dessert.  I've had this before, but my recipe called for only one package of cream cheese making the middle layer smaller.  I think its better with 2 packages.  Thanks for sharing!  Tip: put pretzels in ziploc bag and crush with rolling pin.

This is an awesome recipe and has been used by my family for years. Every fourth of july my cousin would make this recipe and it has turned into one of the family favorites, just like mom's old fashioned potato salad.  One thing that my cousin does differently however is she substitutes the strawberries and strawberry jello with raspberries and raspberry jello. Yum Yum

It was really good, but the bottom layer was too thin. Then again I didn't measure the pretzels after I crushed them.

I love this dessert! It’s so tasty! The combination of crunchy salty crust, creamy sweet cream cheese and tart strawberries is delicious. I usually add another 1/2 cup or so of pretzels and a bit more butter/sugar for the crust as I’ve found that 1 1/2 cups doesn’t seem to be enough for a 9x13” pan.

I made this for a Christmas luncheon and everyone loved it.  I followed some suggestions from other reviewers (added brown sugar to crust, let the cheesecake set completely before adding jell-o, etc.) and it came out perfect and was easy to make. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is one of those old standards that you make in the summer time for pool parties and summer gatherings.  I made this as a light dessert for Thanksgiving and it went quickly.  It was the first one to go.

I used sliced frozen strawberries instead of whole ones and my family loved it.  I took it to the family picnic and they requested it for next years.  Loved it.

I remember once that before I made this with this recipe,my mom actually made the same thing,it was delicious!But I,unfortunately,hate the combination of pretzels and sweet things,but it was still good.What I’m saying is that even though the pretzel part isn’t my favorite thing ever,but it is still a all time favorite!

Everyone loves this.  I cut the recipe in half and it turned out great.  I also let the jello set up some before pouring onto the cream cheese layer.  Simple recipe.

It tasted really good, but I had the soggy-pretzel problem that some others mentioned. Next time, I’ll definitely do some tweaking. Also, I used sliced frozen strawberries like some others mentioned in the comments as well!

I made this for a July 4th party.  It was the first thing gone. I added blueberries to the top with the strawberries. I had a bit of a time restraint  so I made the jello the quick way  too.

In June, pick fresh strawberries, cut meaure & freeze. Then for each holiday, pull out a bag and place in hot jello mixture. Perfect summer treat for Thanksgiving, Christmas & Easter!

This version was too sweet for my family. Next time I will half the cream cheese and double the entire jello layer. It also works better to use sliced strawberries.

Absolutely loved this! Unfortunately I followed the suggestion of another user and doubled the jello portion to equal the cream cheese portion...that was a mistake. It was way too much jello. Next time I’ll follow the recipe. Also, I used raspberry jello and frozen raspberries and the flavor was really REALLY good!!!!!

I loved it! I was confused on the 16 oz frozen strawberries. I bought literally just that but then I had to slice up the strawberries once they thawed in the jello. So was I suppose to buy the sliced strawberries with sugar in a tub instead of literally just strawberries that are frozen?And I only had 1/3 less fat cream cheese on hand but will not be using that again. It turned out a little runny...so the presentation wasn’t the best. So I hope someone learns from my mistake.

Good, but makes a skimpy, too thin, 13 x 9 pan.  Up ingredient volumes by another 1/2 of original measurement, or make in 9 x 9 pan.

I have made this several times, and it has always been a huge hit.  I followed the recipe the first couple of time, but then I tried fresh berries on top instead of the jello mixture.  It is still 5 stars as the recipe is written, but I much prefer it using fresh berries instead.

I made this today, using gluten-free pretzels for the crust. It came out really good! The only thing I might do different is use two packages of jello and 1 package of cream cheese, just to balance proportions a little more evenly. Taste is delicious though, spot on! Thanks Tom!

Love this dish! I make it every Christmas.  The sweet and salty combination is perfect as a side or dessert! Cutting and serving is the hard part, make sure you have a good knife and a flat metal spatula.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did differently was to double the jello but I used the same amount of sliced strawberries.  I have been asked to make it again.

This is absolutely delicious and a new holiday staple! I didn’t add anything to the recipe, but read some of the other reviews. I’m thinking about doubling the amount of jello next time, but it’s really perfect as is.

Very good. Recommend putting in a couple more crushed pretzels if the pretzel sugar butter mixture looks too buttery. That happened to us when we made it.

This is the bomb!  It was only three of us for Thanksgiving but I wanted to try this special-looking dessert.  I easily halved it (except for the jello packet,  which worked out fine).   I used sugar-free Jell-O, Greek cream cheese, and light whipped topping to cut down on fat and calories.  We all loved it!

I love making this but I need help with one thing, when I pour the jello and strawberries, it goes down through the cream cheese and down to pretzels which makes them soggy and bits of cream cheese float in my jello. It still tastes the same of course, but how do I keep it looking pretty?

I followed another review that doubled the jello/strawberry portion of it which was a nice touch. I had raving reviews from my friends who tried it. Definitely will make again!

I used frozen blueberries and a mix of grape and cherry gelatin instead of the Strawberry.  Made this for my grandson's birthday - at his request - and he loved.  Apparently so did everyone else because is was gone very early through the party.

Since this is one of my husband's favorite desserts,  I've made this recipe countless times in the twenty four years we've been married. In fact, we served this at our wedding reception using raspberry Jello and fresh raspberries from our garden. I use only 3 Tbsp sugar in the crust, and usually use finely chopped/smashed fresh strawberries (or finely chopped and sugared ones I froze during strawberry season). Any seasoned cook will be able to adjust the liquid to Jello ratio when using fresh berries versus frozen, liquified ones. This is a classic recipe that you can't go wrong with! As others mentioned, the salty, crunchy pretzels pair well with the creamy middle, and tangy sweet topping.

This dessert is requested by my 34 year old daughter for her birthday every year. One reviewer said her crust was soggy. To avoid this, spread the cream cheese layer to the edge so you seal it and the Jello layer doesn’t leak down the sides into the crust. Also, put your Jello mixture in the fridge to thicken before pouring it over the cream cheese layer. These two tips will make a delicious dessert with a crunchy crust. This is one of my family’s favorite recipes.

I substituted mango/passion fruit JELLO and a frozen tropical fruit medley for the strawberry layer, scattering some pretzel goldfish crackers, oyster crackers, and "tropical" Swedish Fish candies in among the fruit, because the office I work in is doing an ocean-themed potluck, and I thought it would be fun to make a sort of coral reef. If I do that again, I think I'll add a second layer of JELLO on top, something blue like the ocean. I am absolutely going to do the strawberry version for my family soon, though - no matter what fruit flavours get used, the salad is yummy, and my husband has a fondness for strawberries.

So, so good!!! Definitely a keeper! Simple ingredients, simple steps.  The only teeny tiny modifications I made, if you can even call it that,  was to let the cream cheese soften before beating, and I thawed my whole frozen strawberries a bit so I could slice them up (store didn't have sliced frozen strawberries without sugar added).

It is not  necessary to modify anything!  No need for doubling the jello. It would be too much jello.  No need to harden the jello either!  It immediately begins to harden with the frozen strawberries!   Make sure your cream cheese creates a barrier and cover all sides and you won't have any leakage.  The only thing I will take away from the reviews is do not use hard pretzels.  I bought hard pretzels. I made it the night before and the pretzels were hard for two days.  Other than that, this pretzel salad is delicious the way it is.

I added 1/2 cup more of the strawberries than the recipe called for, due to my deep love of strawberries! And of course I followed the instructions regarding never, ever, using the frozen fake whipped topping; why would I insult a great  recipe like that? I loved it and will make it again and again. Thanks for sharing it!

This was great but I made mine a little differently. I did the Jell-O strawberry layer on the bottom and put the cream cheese on top. And then I did pretzels crushed up on the side so people can add them on as a garnish if they wanted. Huge hit!

I added a few more pretzels and a little less butter. Also added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. I let the jello set for 30 min in the fridge then poured it on.

This is great! This dish is deceptively tricky and one small extra step (that my husband figured out) is to use cut strawberries or cut yourself and place them on the cream cheese after set. The strawberries should be frozen. Then pour over the jello (before it's jello but not when it's too hot) and stick it straight in the fridge! Doing that I have never had it flop on me!

I have made this about a hundred times and it is always a favorite. I do increase the sugar in the crust to 6 tablespoon to get a crunchier crust. Make sure you are chilling between each steps. I don't use frozen strawberries as I live in An area that has delicious fresh strawberries. I use fresh strawberries cut up and frozen while prepping the other steps. It's amazing. I love this salad.

Delicious! We all dislike cream cheese in our family, but after having this dessert at our favorite tea place I wanted to replicate it. Only one out of six didn't like it, and most just thought it was whipped cream because it didn't have an overwhelming cream cheese flavor. I will definitely make this again!

Followed recipe to the mark. Used one small box strawberry gelatin and two tubs of frozen strawberries in their juice. Had enough liquid so I didn’t need to add any water. Over the top GOOD!!! Might only bake crust for 5 minutes next. Used large spring form pan. Presentation was FABULOUS!!!

I wanted to use an 11x15 pan, so I made 1 1/2 recipe.  I also  substituted 2 one pound packs of fresh sliced strawberries for the frozen with 2 packs of Jello.  Next time I will pre cut the crust in the pan before adding toppings. Delicious!

This has been a family favorite for years. A few helpful hints:
1. Cool the crust completely before spreading creamy mixture on top. 
2. Spread the creamy mixture all the way to the edges. Be careful that there are no gaps where jello can run through or your crust will be soggy.
3. Make sure the jello mixture is very cool...not warm at all, or it will melt the cream cheese layer. 
Follow these steps, and you will have a wonderful, delicious, treat. My mother and grandchildren ask for it at every gathering.

Made it exactly as recipe states until I realized it was way too much butter when I spread the crushed pretzels into the pan. I quickly crushed more pretzels and added a little more sugar.  If I hadn't done this it would have been a buttery mess at the bottom. Also, it didn't look like there would be enough pretzel crust to cover the 9x13 pan if I didn't add more, so it worked out.  Long story short, crush more pretzels than recipe calls for. And really CRUSH them...this "crust" won't form if it's big chunks of pretzels.

I didn’t care for the jello top, too fake tasting. The pretzels weren’t as fabulous as others thought. Graham wafer crust would be just as good. The middle was fine.

In  the video she says to add 2 1/2 cups of pretzels and the recipe says 1 1//2 cups. Maybe why the crust is soggy?
I'm changing my review a little. While making this I had put the cream cheese mixture on top of the pretzel crust, got sidetracked and when I came back to it, realized,,,I had forgotten the whip cream. Scraped off the cream cheese, added the whip cream and spread it back on. I'm thinking because it had a layer of cream cheese first, the crust stayed crunchy even days after making this. It was a big hit!

Delicious and easy to make.  My husband remembered this dessert from his childhood, saying how good it was but, I had never had it before.  Well it’s pretty darn good.  It is very sweet.
Will be perfect for our Easter dinner with family.  I love the pretzel crust, a nice crunchy contrast to the creamy filling and fruity gelatin topping.

Made this (again) for Christmas 2017. No changes but PAY ATTENTION!  It says 1 (6 oz.) strawberry gelatin.  Be sure to get TWO of the small jello boxes OR one 6 oz box, which my store did not have.

I read all the tips and tricks. Not sure what happened but when I put the jello strawberry mixture in fridge for just 15 minutes it had already gel’d!?!?!?!  So, I improvised and made up some orange jello. Only flavor on hand. Scooped the lumpy strawberry jello out on top of cream cheese mixture and poured orange jello on top. Am sure it will taste fine, just...don’t pre-refrigerate your jello as some tips state. If you ask me.

So delicious! My grandmother made this for parties when I was little. I substitute regular pretzels with Gluten free pretzels for the people with allergies in our family and it doesn't taste any different! (I did add about a 1/2 cup of extra pretzel, because the crust was too thin otherwise.)

I LOVE this salad (dessert?) and so does everyone for whom I make it.  When I make for Thanksgiving I use cranberries rather than strawberries and it's wonderful!  I chop the cranberries in my food processor.  I have to force myself to only have one serving!

No changes, but I read many of the reviews before I made it and took them into consideration.  Baked the pretzel mixture for the recommended time so as not to burn.  I did add a few chopped pecans on top of the cream cheese mixture and a few on top of jello and strawberry layer.  I have never had much success with making a pretzel salad before because it always seemed to start melting before I could get it served.  This was perfect and the best recipe I have ever used.

The recipe tasted good, but it needed much more time in the refrigerator, or maybe a recipe change. The jello did not set, even overnight, and it ended up quite soggy and runny.

Great I made as directed but I needed to bake the pretzel crust 20 min. Accidentally put too much butter I think, but it turned out fine. Also its amazing topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips!

not enough cool whip and cream cheese for a 13×9 pan,but almost just the way i remembered making it. so thank you for the recipe. 

p.s. should be 16 ozs of cool whip and 2 blocks of cream cheese to make the white layer thicker and 2 more tbsp of sugar to put with the cream mix.

The only thing wrong with this recipe is you probably shouldn't eat the whole thing in one sitting. XD It is so yummy! Warning, don't over bake the pretzels, they are done before you'd think! (People kept leaving them and scooping just the first two layers)

Great sweet and salty combination!

I used frozen cherries and cherry gelatin as that is what I had on hand and it was a hit. Ate leftovers for 3 days with minimal sogginess setting in.

A few minor modifications a little bit of vanilla to the cream cheese layer, and use 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the strawberry syrup instead of 2 cups cold water  depending on how firm you like your jello

A few days ago, I made this for the first time and I've been cooking for 50 years!  I took it to a ladies' luncheon and everyone raved when they found out what I brought for dessert.  The flavors were marvelous.  I did not alter the recipe at all.  I DID encounter a bit of a problem getting all of the crust off the bottom of the pan intact and it baked for the recommended 10 minutes--not longer.  I had to work at it a bit with the spatula; however, one of the other women said she had had the same problem whenever she made this dessert (not the same recipe source).    ***The 2nd time I made this, I rubbed a wee bit of Crisco on the bottom of the pan before spreading the pretzel layer---this made getting the crust out somewhat easier.  Give this a try!    Oh, and I only cooked the crust for 9 minutes instead  of 10.

I used  a 9" springform pan and modified quantities of ingredients (using fractions & percentages to the shock of my daughter who thinks one doesn't utilize math in everyday life!). I also substituted lite whip topping and cream cheese.  After reading the reviews, I also used half white & half brown sugar in the crust.  This is the first time I made it and will definitely be making it again

Made this with minor changes - most of which were recommended by reviewers (thank you, thank you).  First of all, this is very time consuming because of the essential cooling periods for each layer.   I used 2 cups of pretzels and it still barely covered the bottom of the pan.  Thought the cream layer would be higher and conversely, thought there was too much to the jello layer.  Next time, I'm going to use a 9 x 9 pan which should resolve 2 of these problem, and use only one package of jello with less fruit.  Love the concept.  Thanks for the recipe.

Hit at our church picnic. The hint on chilling the layers prior to putting the jello mixture on was a great help.

A little gelatin added to the jello goes a long way. I used fresh sliced strawberries in the jello to reduce the amount of sugar and the gelatin helped firm the mix quickly. Definitely, let jello cool for about 1 hour before adding to the layers.

My mom starting making this, or something similar, starting in the '70's. She made it in a 9x13, for summer picnics. She also uses the pretzel crumb crust, with a cream cheese filling, then lemon filling. She calls it a lemon pretzel tort. Both delicious!

Made this for Mother's Day. Everyone loved it. I should've let the jello part sit in the fridge a little longer, like others recommended, to thicken up before adding to the cream cheese-whipped topping layer, but it still came out great.  I'm not too familiar with making recipes with jello, so that was my thing. I did use two boxes of jello and fresh strawberries. Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe using the tips about baking the pretzels for only 10 mins and changed it a bit by using 2 cups of pretzels, 1 cup of butter and 6 TBS of sugar. I also used 4 cups of fresh picked blueberries and 2 3oz berry jello since it's blue. Turned out fabulous!!!

After reading a ton of reviews and comparing this to my original recipe of 20 years, I decided to make this exactly as suggested.  I was concerned about how much butter went into the crust and one less jello pack than I usually use.  The end result was spectacular.  Don't do anything different.  Well ... maybe the one thing I'd change is to make it in a deeper 9x13.  My mother's refrigerator wasn't level and I lost a lot of liquid jello - what a mess. The extra buttery crust completely enhanced the flavor.

I remember this recipe as a child and although we now live in the U.K. I had a hankering for it. Problem is, this recipe is particularly unfriendly for those outside the US because of the measurements used as well as the specific ingredients. So on the off chance someone else is wanting to convert it, here's some tips: use two 135 g packets of strawberry "jelly" packets instead of the "jello" and make as directed, substituting the "2 cups boiling water" for the amount in the packet recipe and substituting the cold water directed as the 225 frozen strawberries (so don't add cold water at all). Also, 8 oz = 225 g, 6 oz = 170 g. And just use whipped cream instead of "frozen whipped topping (aka cool whip)", cool whip is to margarine as whipped cream is to butter. Angel Delight in the U.K. is similar but the flavorings can be different so it's safer just using whipped cream. Also, cream cheese is "soft cheese" as well. 

So with those conversions taken on board I made this recipe and it turned out perfectly, although I cut the recipe in half because I only had to serve four adults and I didn't want to eat the rest of it by myself. I used a 9" round pan instead of the 9x13 and it worked out perfectly. My three guests loved the result, two of which were "not dessert people," one from asia, one from Africa, and one from the U.K. And I hate jello but still missed this and loved it. So I HIGHLY recommend this recipe because it's a crowd pleaser. And don't double the jello.

I made this is a spring form pan, I let the jello and strawberries slightly set in their own bowl while the crust and cream cheese layers cooled in the freezer then slowly poured the strawberries over the top.  Back into the freezer to set hard for about 2 hours.

Use less cream cheese, reduce cream middle layer overall.  Increase strawberries and make sure they are sliced or in pieces. Maybe a smidge more butter, and be sure not to overbake crust. Maybe 8-9 minutes would be better.

It came out good, only thing the pretzels were stuck at the bottom. Next time I will grease the pan and then put the crushed pretzels at the bottom. I didn't have strawberry jello but I had black cherry jello soI used it and it came out beautiful. I also used blended some strawberries with little water, and used it in the jello mix. That definitely gave it a kick alongside with the chopped strawberries ??.

Excellent! Always a crowd pleaser.  I found that if I do the pretzel shell and the cream cheese layer the night before and chill it in the fridge, then do the Jell-O and the strawberry filling layers the  next day, this works out best.

Been making this exact recipe for my family since 1980. They loved it...hubby too.  
Now my daughter makes it for her  family.
The pretzel crust is what sends this dessert over the top.

Followed another reviewer's advice to double the jello and I'm glad I did!  The creamy layer would have been too overpowering otherwise.  I also chilled the jello mixture while the crust/cream layers were chilling and it helped the whole thing set up faster.  Finally I completely agree with taking the crust out exactly at 10 mins, and it helps to let the finished product sit on the counter for a few mins before trying to serve to help the crust let go of the pan a bit.  Yummy!

This is a great recipe, as written.  I decrease the calories, without losing the sweet crunchy goodness.  I make it upside down.  First the jello layer, then the cream cheese layer -- with low fat cream cheese and cool whip free, then plain crushed pretzels-- no butter and extra sugar.

Healthier Version:
I used Organic Coconut Sugar in the Pretzel Crust. I would have used it in the Cream cheese mix but didn't want it to be brown so I used regular sugar. I substituted Neutfatel Cheese, Sugar Free Jello and Fat Free Coolwhip & nobody noticed a difference.   ;)    my stepdaughter said it was better than her gramma's.

This recipe is amazing. I prefer however doubling the jello and fruit and using raspberry jello and frozen raspberries instead of strawberries. A fun twist.

I have made this three years in a row for a Christmas potluck at church and never bring any home. I use green food coloring for the cream cheese/whip cream mixture to add "Christmas" flair. It gets rave reviews when I make it.

Note to self: chill jello only for 10 min before pouring into pan or it will start to congeal.  Strawberry syrup idea was good; fewer strawberries was better than full pound.  Was delicious!!

This is absolutely delicious, I've aready made it twice and it never lasts the week. Highly recomend it!

Note: Make sure not to cook the crust too long or it will not turn out, no more than 10 minutes.

This turned out great!  I did have to double the crust recipe as the original recipe didn't cover the bottom of my 9x13 pan.  I still only baked the crust for 10 minutes, though.  My family loved it!

This was great for my family Thanksgiving my cousins and I had a dessert competition and I won. Everyone loved this although the Jell-O was a little wobbly it came out perfect the pretzel was a good idea for the crust and it taste amazing as well think I'll make it again this weekend. It is also not expensive to make at all a great go to dessert for the kids.

Family favorite at the holidays!  It is time consuming because eat layer must chill in between.  I added the frozen strawberries to the jello which helped cool the jello down quickly.  I did add a little vanilla to the cream cheese layer.  Everyone loved it.

I did use more jello like one of the other reviewers suggested and next time I'll probably make the crust a little finer to see if my grandchildren will eat more than the top two layers.

I tried this recipe on the recommendation of a friend who said her boyfriend loves this dish. It's ok. Just not my thing I guess.  On tip I have for you though: I made it in a spring-form pan. I really shouldn't have done that! The butter leaked out and down into the oven and created a smoky mess. Plus, the middle cream cheese/sugar/cool whip layer was too soft for the taking the spring-form sides down.

Delicious! Acouple things I'll change before next time...use either fresh strawberries or make sure the frozen ones are completely thawed before adding to jello. I had a runny mess from the thawing strawberries overflowing the pan after a couple hours. I made this ahead for Thanksgiving but we ate it the night before since it was leaking all over the fridge shelf below! Also, my 9x13 pan was tied up so I made the unfortunate choice of using an 8x11....hence the overflow. Use the right sized dish and thawed strawberries! :) Tasted wonderful!

This was really good! However, I would slice the strawberries next time. Also, I had to add more pretzels and butter due to them not covering the entirety of the bottom of the pan. This dish tasted great, though!

I love this dessert I tried it a few years ago at our family's 4th of July party and it was amazing so the other day I went on a hunt to find that very same recipe and I found it, made it and it was just as good as I remember it. BTW I LOVE THIS APP

Love this recipe! Winner at every pot luck. Prefer to use brown sugar when making the crust seems to make people think it's a nutty crust. Also use lite whipped topping and use Neufchatel instead of cream cheese to help make it a bit healthier for everyone and no one knows the difference.

This was delicious, but the crust was really stuck in the pan good. It was hard to get it out. It took a lot of work to get it out... but still a big hit anyhow! Will definitely make again.

Never had to change a thing, and it's a hit.  Definitely NOT a salad, but a scrumptious dessert.

I love this recipe!! This is my second time making it. I also like some of the other reviews, chilled the gelatin mix in the fridge for an hour or so before placing it on top of the cream cheese/whipped cream layer. Both times it came out perfect!

Excellent! The "salad" title doesn't do it justice. I followed the recipe and used other's suggestions to add vanilla, make sure to bake ONLY 10 minutes, make the jello ahead, etc. My guests loved it, and my son ate a HUGE plateful of it!!

As written this is a strong 4 star recipe! I did make the following changes to bump this to a 5 star for my family and friends .  I increased the crushed pretzels to 2 cups and subbed 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar for the granulated.  The powdered sugar gives it a creamier texture and blends in better as well as allows it to set up sturdier.  I have made this a few times now, but today I used black cherry jello and used mixed (sweet and tart) cherries that I pitted and froze last week.  Hey it's cherry season, and I actually prefer the cherry version over the strawberry , although they're both scrumptious! Thank you for the recipe it's a regular rotation here on our ranch!

I made this exactly as the recipe specified, but I took other reviewers notes and was careful not to bake the crust for longer than 10 minutes - and I'm glad I didn't as it didn't look set when I pulled it from the oven but was quite crispy when cooled.

I did also follow other reviewers suggestions to let the jello mix cool in the fridge while I was making the cream cheese layer, but apparently my fridge is super powerful because after only 20 minutes, the jello was no longer liquid and runny - I had to break it down to get it out of the bowl and it never did set up properly in the finished dish, so I'm sure it changed the texture. However, I really liked the texture of the frozen strawberries, even though they were large chunks instead of slices. It didn't look as pretty as it could have, but it tasted great. 

When I make it again (which I will!) I think I'll double the jello layer, as it was relatively thin compared to the cream cheese, and the strawberries were a bit spread out.

For flavor, though, this definitely delivered. It was a small party, but the dish was empty when I went home! Fantastic cold dessert on a hot day.

This was very good. I was hesitant about making this at first because I'm not the biggest fan of jello but I'm glad I gave it a chance. I used fresh sliced strawberries and made it in a cheesecake and it was great. I can see me using this crust for more than just this recipe.

Delicious jello. I agree with previous comments not to over are the pretzel crust. It's a nice alternative to plain jello.

I followed the suggestions from other reviewers for the crust baking time, vanilla to cream cheese mixture, and "seal" the cream cheese mixture over the crust.  All turned out well.  Being a child of the 1970's, I am used to jello salads, but my kids weren't crazy about this.  They peeled off the jello layer and just ate the cream cheese layer and pretzel crust.  Would probably have been better without the jello and just fresh strawberries on the top.

This was one of the most delicious desserts I have ever tasted. Sometimes the texture of jello grosses me out, so I wasn't sure how I would feel about it. It was the perfect consistency and tasted great. The cream cheese part tastes like the best cheesecake ever! Really glad I went out on a limb and tried this. I usually don't end up finishing any dessert that I make, but this one didn't last past the second day!

So easy to make and delicious!  Followed the recipe to a tee but would love some more of the pretzel crust. I used strawberries from my garden and froze them instead of store bought fruit. I would definitely make this again!

Outstanding recipe! I followed other reviewer's suggestions & let the jello thicken slightly before pouring over cream cheese layer. I also additionally, made a low carb version for my mom, who is diabetic & she loved it. This is a great recipe that I will use again & again!

while making this, I was afraid that it would be far too sweet. I brought it to an Easter party, and it was gone in minutes! People loved it! I've even had requests put in for upcoming events. The only changes I made was adding extra pretzels to the crust because it was too runny for my taste. Also, the jello was a little disproportionate to the cream cheese, so I recommend doubling it if you'd like the cream cheese to jello ratio to be more equal.

This was such a good dish for Easter this year! It sounds odd but all layers complement each other so well! This is an extremely sweet dish to cut some sugar out don't use as much in the pretzel crust and add some extra fresh strawberry's!

I accidentally added too much sugar to the pretzels. It tasted great, but I felt like it took away from the saltiness of the pretzel. I also used fresh strawberries and marie calendars brand gel instead of the gelatin. It was definitely a crowd pleaser!

Always a family favorite!  Remember to allow plenty of prep time since this does take a while to prepare, allowing for the cooling of the crust and the layers to set up before adding the next one.  It's not a difficult recipe and worth the time.  You substitute low-fat and sugar-free ingredients easily.

This is one of our favorite desserts.  Absolutely delicious & never any leftovers.   Easy to make.  Just watch the pretzel base to make sure it doesn't burn.

I've been asked to make this many times as it's a family favorite.  I also made this using frozen peaches with peach jello.  I took one of each to a family cook out and had none leftover!

I made this almost exactly how it read....except I didn't have pretzels!  I used one bag of crushed Oreos with a half stick of melted butter for the crust.  Everyone loved it!  I will make this again with or without pretzels!

I just made this  for a holiday gathering.  My family all thought the pretzels sounded terrible as a crust and all I heard was eww you're making that?  Well, I got compliments all through the dinner, most people came back for seconds and it was a rare time at this gathering that I left with an empty pan.  The pretzels imitate a nut crust, I had a couple of people ask if it was nuts in the crust.  The crust does solidify on the pan so it needs to be cut with a knife and a sturdy spatula to get it out.  I did not change a single thing in the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

This is absolutely delicious and it actually lasted a few days without pretzels getting real soggy.  I made sure to take the pretzel layer out after 10 minutes and it was perfect.  The only thing I did different was letting the jello chill a bit to thicken slightly before spreading onto the cream cheese layer.  Great recipe for Christmas!

Made again as written and decided it is too sweet.  So next time I will only add 2 tbsp sugar to the pretzels (try 2 c. pretzels) and 1/2 c. to the cream cheese.  I did use light cream cheese and light cool whip.  i will review again next time I make it with these changes.

Love this recipe.  I've made it twice!  I double the amount of pretzel to make two 8x8x8 pans.  The thicker crust takes longer in the oven, so I just bake it low on 350 for 10 minutes, then zap it at 400 until hardened.  

I do agree with the reviewer who mentioned it's not exactly 'heart-healthy', but sugar free cool whip, and reduced fat cream cheese/margarine make a difference without making it any less delicious.

My best suggestion would be to add about 1/2 of a cup of sugar to the pretzels if you don't like the salty taste. You will need to use a bit more butter though to compensate for it. It cuts the salt to a minimum and gives you a nice sweet crust.

This dish is AMAZING! I had never heard of it before, neither had my family, and we all fell in love. I must say though, I always kind of fumble my way through recipes. So a few things I did differently (mostly without knowing it): I used brown sugar instead of white for the crust, and added some pecans; I used real whipped cream(2 cups heavy whipping cream, 2 tbsp. sugar, and a splash of vanilla) mixed with the cream cheese, and I made the JELLO in a separate dish and slid it on top after it had set. The result, slightly healthier, just as delicious heaven in your mouth!

This recipe is fantastic, if you want to you can cut down the sugar, depending on personal taste. I did closer to a half a cup and it  was perfect.  Absolutely follow Lynde's tips - bake the crust only for a few minutes, let the jello start to set before pouring over the cream cheese layer. This isn't ACTUALLY a salad (wow), it's a dessert.

I followed a suggestion to let the jello slightly thicken before pouring over the cream cheese layer which I also refrigerated. I used 1/2 frozen and 1/2 fresh strawberries I wanted to use up.  If you really hate cool whip, try whipping up an envelope of dream whip. It has a different texture and less chemical tasting. I always keep a box in the pantry.

My favorite casserole dessert. Fantastic flavor with buttery pretzel base, sweet jello and fruit top with a beautiful creamy cream cheese middle. Desserts don't get much better than this. I sometimes use mixed fruit or raspberry to change it up. VERY GOOD!

I have made it for every holiday family get together for the last 4 years.  Everyone loves it . Never any leftovers. I make it just as recipe states.  To keep jello from seeping into crust make sure cream cheese layer goes completely to all edges of pan.

I've been making this for years. When mixing the jello and fruit I always refrigerate the mixture so it starts to thicken. Then spoon over the cream cheese mixture. This will stop any leaking of the liquid down to the crust. I also only use 8 oz cream cheese with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup of whipped topping.

I have making this for years but my recipe is a little different, the biggest being the use of pineapple juice instead of the water.  I think it helps to cut some of the "sweetness" of this recipe but it's a family favorite.  Its interesting to see the comments from the others like the crust becoming so hard - I have had that happena few times so very careful to take it out after 9 or 10 minutes.  It's time consuming but so worth it!

Been making this over 30 yrs.  It's always a big hit!  Really needs to be eaten within a day  as the crust gets mushy after that.  But it usually doesn't last that long!

Made this for a retirement potluck (9/25/15); did as other Reviewers suggested & doubled my jello ... And the am't of strawberries & crust, kept the sugar/cream cheese ratio the same. End result = GONE! Some coworkers said it was sweet, others said it was just right. Going to make this for a church potluck next week and will use 1/2 the am't of sugar & double the crust/jello/berry portions again. This is a keeper; thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipe. Made it with frozen raspberries and raspberry Jello.  I cooked the pretzel crust for 9 minutes, and followed the recipe to the t. My family loved it!

This is one of my favorite go-to baby shower recipes! I would give it 5 stars if I hadn't modified it to my tastes. Instead of whipped topping in a tub, I prefer to use 8 oz whipping cream, whipped with vanilla. I also doubled the strawberries and only used one cup boiling water for the gelatin. It was still amazing!

Do not bake the crust more than 10 minutes. Put the gelatin/strawberry mixture in the fridge for about an hour or so to thicken a bit before pouring it overtop of the cream cheese mixture (this is very key for the success of the dessert).

I made this for 4th of July. Thank you Tom and Judy. I knew about this dessert for years but never made it, big mistake! I followed your recipe except I had and used fresh strawberries, freezing them with 2 Tbsp water for 50 minutes. Used 3 cups of boiling water. This dessert delighted everyone young and old. Taffy

I made this for Father's Day, and instead of using pretzels we used graham crackers, and it was delicious.  One thing make sure u get the Jell-O mixed well....clumps of it don't taste well.  Definitely a keeper!

I just tried this recipe today and it was a big hit.  I read reviews ahead of time and followed some of the advice.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring to the cream cheese part and I allowed the strawberry gelatin mixture to set for about 45 minutes before putting it on top of cream cheese layer.  (I think next time I will only let it set for 20-30 minutes before putting it on top of the cream cheese layer.)  It was great.  Everyone loved it!  The crunch is great and made people ask if it had nuts in it.  I will definitely make this again.

Brought it to a party and it was an instant hit, people were obsessed with the crust. Used fresh picked strawberries instead of frozen so I put  the gelatin in an ice bath while I was stirring the strawberries in, otherwise it would take forever to cool down.I was very crunched for time overall so I sped up the process by putting using the freezer instead of the fridge. 10 minutes to set the cream cheese layer and about 20 minutes to set the jello/strawberry layer. I will definitely be making this again.

I've made this for years. I only make it at Christmas because of the red color.

My family loves raspberries, so I use them instead. I use frozen ones. I slightly thaw them, not all the way.

This is so yummy. I would call it a desert, not a salad. If calling it a salad makes you feel better, go ahead, lol.

Baked crust for 10 minutes but I think I should have used 1c melted butter to the crust.  Mine was delicious but it did not hold together like I wanted.  The filling was delicious!!  I cut the sugar down to 3/4c when adding to the 2 packages of lite cream cheese filling.  I made a mistake though with the jello- although, I used SF strawberry jello and after mixing 2 pkgs of jello with 2 c of boiling water (as others suggested), I put the bowl in the fridge.  The problem is that  I forgot about it and left it in the fridge for about 30 minutes.  When I added it to pie, the jello was already set and ended up being a "glob" of jello on the pie- still delicious though.  So as a note to myself for making this again- I will try 1 c of melted butter for the crust.  Keep the 3/4 sugar, 3/4 tub of cool whip for filling. Lastly, I will not leave the jello mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes-maybe 5 or 10 minutes then pour it on top of pie.  
The recipe was delicious- everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!  Will make it again and try alternatives mentioned above.  
Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made this a few times and it always disappears:) our family loves it! Only thing I do differently though is I use raspberries and raspberry jello instead of strawberry:) you get a salty, sweet and sour dessert all in one if using raspberries! Enjoy!

Oh my goodness this was delicious. I brought it to a potluck as a dessert and everyone loved it.  I followed the directions almost to a T. The only thing I did differently was after stirring in the berries and allowed them to thaw a bit, I used kitchen scissors to snip them into smaller uniform sized pieces for more even distribution. I used a greased glass pan and was a bit worried when I pulled the baked crust out of the oven and it was sliding around the pan. Although I was tempted to bake it longer I followed other reviewers' advice and left it as it was. I'm so glad I did because after it cooled it set up very nicely. I love this recipe because I can make it even when strawberries aren't in season because the recipe calls for frozen.  I ate it the next day and like it even better because the crust softened a bit and all the flavors were able to marry. Will make this again and again and again...

Everyone I made this for loved it! Only think I would do different next time is make the pretzel layer a little thicker or put it in a smaller dish so it could be taller. I love thick crust :)

It was very good. I actually used graham crumbs instead of pretzels because I didn't want the salt from the pretzels. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the graham crumbs for added flavor.

Fantabulous! The only change is that next time, I'll check to see if the frozen strawberries I buy are cut. I opened the bag to pour on the strawberries and they were whole so it didn't look very pretty. Might try raspberries and raspberry jello next time.

My fiance is not big on sweets but he couldn't get enough of this.  I on the other hand do not like cream cheese but this combination works.  The sweet and salty are wonderful together.  After being asked to make 3 cheesecakes for him to take to work, I think I can get buy with 3 of these instead.  Thank you  Judy.

I was afraid that even after baking the crust for only 10 minutes as other reviewers said that it wasn't going to come out of the pan -- but it was fine. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding about 1/2 cup more pretzels and it was a big hit! I made it the night before and maybe that was why the crust was perfect. It is super-rich, though!!

I have made this recipe a lot.  Every time I take it to potlucks it's one of the first to go.  I'm being asked for the recipe on a regular basis.  I like to use frozen raspberries in place of the strawberries.  This is definitely a crowd please of all ages.   Eileen of Egypt

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the combination but WOW! So good, especially the salty pretzel crust. I made this in an 11" springform pan. I read the reviews & made a few adjustments based on others recommendations. For the crust, I used about 2-1/2 cups of pretzels & brown sugar; baked for about 8 mins. For the filling, I made my own whipped cream and added a 1tsp of vanilla extract. I chilled this & the strawberry-jello mixture for an hour before combining the layers.

I have to admit, when a friend brought this to a party I was skeptical -- jello and cream cheese in salad? However, when I took a bite my opinion totally changed. This salad is delicious and it's a total crowd pleaser among kids and adults. Add this to your recipes box for your next potluck..it's a winner.

The taste is amazing.  The only differences for me were substituting Neufatchel cheese for the cream cheese as it is "healthier" and using fresh strawberries.  I definitely let the gelatin/strawberry mixture set on its own for 45 min. in the fridge prior to pouring it on top of the cream cheese mixture.  Yum!

I LOVE Strawberry Pretzel Salad! Make this... RIGHT NOW! A couple tweaks... I make my own whip cream w/ heavy cream. You do not need to add sugar to the whip. The 1 c. white sugar to the cream cheese is enough (at least for us it is). I also like to use a 3oz strawberry mixed with 3oz raspberry jello. Sometimes I like to add more pretzels too. Soo good!

I had an aunt that made this yummy dessert and she passed away before I was able to get it from her. I made this recipe for my family and they devoured it! It was super good, but a little richer than I remember hers to be. If your not a fan of really sweet and really buttery, I would probably pare that back a little bit. You may also want to increase the amount of pretzels to give it a more solid base.

I made this for a potluck. It was a big hit! My grandma and aunt make it with raspberry jello and raspberries instead of strawberries. I would also like to point out to double up the cream cheese layer. Some people enjoy this salad with a graham cracker crust, but I like it with the pretzels.

Used 3T brown sugar and 1.5T white sugar in the crust. Used a springform pan. Was great. The frozen strawberries take an exceedingly long time to thaw, so it is probably worth it to let those sit out/ thaw halfway first. I ended up having to increase the boiling water from 1c to about 1.5 b/c of the sheer amount of frozen strawberries needing thawing.

My aunt makes this for family gatherings and everyone loves it. The one difference is that she uses raspberries instead of strawberries. Yum!

This recipe(or one incredibly similar to it) has been in my family for nearly 2 generations now. My mom started making it when I was very young and said that everyone was grossed out when she said it was a strawberry pretzel SALAD. But once they tasted it, it became a tradition to bring it to every family gathering. We eventually had to start making 2 or 3 batches at a time, because some cousins would only eat this.  I agree with the tips others have left about over baking the pretzels. DONT DO IT! Another common error my family has had was getting too excited about putting it all together, and putting the cream cheese filling on the hot pretzels. Yuck. Also, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that all the nooks and cranny's of your casserole dish are 100% covered, otherwise you will end up with jello in your pretzels.. And no one likes em soggy, or when the white filling is floating in patches..

This is DELICIOUS!  and my favorite version of this recipe!  I used more (2 small packages) Jello, about 2 cups of pretzels.  Used powdered sugar in the cream cheese mixture instead of granulated.  Made sure to let the Jello gel in the fridge a little (great tip!).  Big hit at our family reunion over Memorial Day weekend.

This was a good light dessert but the measurement for the gelatin package was off.  The large package of gelatin is 4.6 ounces and that is what should be used.  I bought 4 small packages because they were 1.4 ounces each (trying to get a total of 6 ounces) and the gelatin was too thick and rubbery and would not spread.  I had to make another package of gelatin to spread on top.

This is a fantastic recipe. Kudos to the one who thought of a pretzel crust! I brought this to my gramma in-laws for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit. I to decreased the hot water and used berry juce to make up for it. The only thing I would change is adding a little more sugar, other than that its perfect. Thanx for taking the time to share this.

So good! I did follow the advice to let the jello sit for a bit before pouring and SLIGHTLY less water because my strawberries seems to have a lot of ice bits in the bag. Really good! Will totally make again. Thanks!

i'm giving this 5 stars for the sheer yumminess of it - which is what the rating system is for!  BUT i also want to mention that this is so close in flavor and sweetness to a cheesecake that it is a little much to be used as a sidedish jellied salad.  seriously, my entire family thought that someone had put the desert out too soon.

I thought this was interesting and I'm not really sure what to make of it. I made it for 4 other people, and though it was all eaten, we didn't really commented on how we liked it. The sweet and salty combination is fun but there just wasn't any depth to it. Nothing that made your mouth go "WOW", just barely satisfying as a dessert.

I made this for the first time and I took it to a baby shower and everybody loved it and wanted the recipe! In my opinion, I think the pretzel crust was too sugary and the amount of sugar for the crust should be cut down. But it was delicious!!

Yummy! I used Splenda and sugar free Jello as I'm a diabetic.  Only complaint is that it is a large dish and the crust gets soggy fast.

I took this to my sister's birthday potluck and came home with an empty clean pan. All over the leftovers were taken home by the guests. After reading the reviews, I was worried about it overfilling my 9x13 pan, so I decided to double the crust (1 bag) and keep the cream cheese and jello the same. I ground pretzel rods in the Cuisinart, next time I will try gravel-sized crumbs. I mixed half the sugar with the pretzels, and sprinkled the rest on top. I used a 10X15? pan that fit well. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the CC mix. For the jello, I drained the strawberry juice and then added enough water to make 2C; I sliced the strawberries and added pineapple tidbits because the amount of fruit looked wimpy.

A get together at my parents home isn't complete if this salad hasn't been made. We follow the instructions with the exception of fresh fruit. I don't like fruit in my jello so we omit it. This recipe is a keeper and a must dish for all get togethers!

This recipe was very good. Salad is, of course, a bit of a stretch and the dish could easily be served as a dessert.  My only suggestion is to cut the filling in half.  I made the dish in a 13x9" pyrex baking dish and after placing the full amount of filling on top of the crust, there was scant room for the jello.  I scraped half out (which was then devoured by my family) and added the jello.  I think the final product had better balance. It was a fun trip back to the '70s when my mom made a similar recipe.

Made this for an Easter brunch and it was gone within an hour.  I added a couple extra handfuls of crushed pretzels for the crust because it seemed a little sparse to me.  Will definitely make this again its wonderful!

Amazing!!!  This salad has replaced the traditional green jello salad that has been served at every Thanksgiving and Christmas since I can remember.  The only change I made is I only make half of the cream cheese mixture that the recipe calls for.  This is my most requested side dish!

I made this yesterday for the office Christmas party and it was a huge hit!

After doubling the recipe, I still added extra pretzel crumbs for a thicker crust.

I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. 

There's not much to improve upon here and it's pretty fool proof if you follow the directions.

This is a great jello salad, kinda like a desert during dinner.  Be sure not to over-cook the crust. I cooked mine for a few minutes longer and it was kinda hard.  Also make sure your cream cheese is at room temp. so you don't get chunks.  Yummy!

This is a great staple recipe for potlucks and large gatherings. I alternate between strawberry jello/strawberries and raspberry jello/raspberries. I prefer the raspberry, personal preference. I also "frost" the whole "salad" with a light layer of cool whip before serving.
This is not the greatest for leftovers as the crust gets soggy. When I make it for my husbands potlucks (always requested)I make it the evening before. The crust is still okay by the next afternoon.

I made this to go with Easter dinner for our family.  Everyone loved it and it was quickly gone.  I was a bit concerned because I baked the crust for 13 min. instead of ten, but had no problems getting it out of the pan, probably because I made it a day ahead of time.  Also I bought individually quick frozen sliced strawberries with no juice, so I added a half cup water to the jello mixture.  Every layer seemed pretty even in quantity to me, and it held together very well.  I will definitely make this again, and am quite certain it will be requested at the next family dinner.

Very yummy.  The perfect balance of salt and sweet....not a strong cheesecake flavor if that's what you are looking for.  I increased the pretzels to two cups and made sure not to over crush them.  I think if they were crushed really fine it would be harder to get out the pan.  I also used some non-stick spray to make it easier to get out.  I increased the jello to 9ounces but that filled the pan to the tippy top and made it a little tricky to get in the fridge without spilling but it turned out good.  I thawed the berries enough to slice and then refroze.  Topped with cool whip.  Good stuff!

I made this with fat-free cream cheese, fat-free cool whip and used Splenda instead of sugar and it came out awesome!  It works really well for pot-luck parties, especially work parties...I brought it into work and it was gone within a few hours.

I have made this recipe many times.  The one thing I do is spray the dish with PAM. When I haven't sprayed the dish, it sticks, but perhaps the review that said she lets it refrigerate overnight is also the key. I also make it in a large Corning Ware (10X14) and don't use the precise measurements..make enough to fill that pan.

I have been making this recipe for years and I have always used pineapple juice instead of water.  It tastes great and gives the salad extra flavor.

Awesome!  I think I let the middle layer sit in the fridge too long (overnight), because when I added the top layer it didn't stick to rest of it when cut.  Oh well, now I know.

I've been making this dish for about 2 years and it's a favorite with my family and friends. The only change I make is using fresh strawberries and then I'll add about 1 tablespoon of water.  It's delicious.

This is a great recipe but one I use is slightly different.  For the cream layer use only ONE 8oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and the one small carton of cool whip.  This is also delicious with Raspberry gelatin.  Use frozen raspberries (not in juice) and add to the gelatin when it has jelled about 40 minutes.  The key is definitely to not bake the crust more than 10 minutes or it does become like cemeent.

Love, love, love this 'salad'.  
The salty pretzels, cream cheese with the sweet Cool Whip and the tart strawberries blend well together. 
The only thing I might do differently next time, is spray the dish with Pam prior to baking.  
Other than that, I'll make this again and again.  The family loved it! 

Thanks for sharing!

My mom made this dish like this for my high school graduation party in 1980. Then, I thought it sounded too strange to try. Now it sounds great. I'm taking it to a family Christmas party tomorrow. I used some suggestions from other reviewers and I'm sure it will be a hit!

I saw this recipe on the home page one day and decided to try it.  My 11 year old son said this was the best thing he'd ever tasted!! Absolutley delicious-a light cheesecake with room for variation.

This did not turn out well at all.  The filling was grainy and the crust was very hard.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I will not make this again.

Yummy!  I made this for a 4th of July gathering.  Several people asked me for the recipe.  I used a package of fresh strawberries instead of frozen because they were cheaper.  I love that it functions as either a side dish or a dessert - or both!

Well this was different... my family didn't care for this.  I think the jello texture was strange combined with the other layers.  Perhaps using pie filling would be better? Also I personally think the sweet/salty contrast is better when using chocolate or vanilla, not fruit.  Not terrible, but not particulary good.  Won't be making this again.

A big hit at the pot luck I took it to.  There's such a great combination of flavors in this--the sweet/salty that others have mentioned, but also the tang from the cream cheese and the slightly browned butter taste as well.  A definite winner!

I don't know what it is about this salad but I have to be careful and not eat it all myself! I think the pretzels salty taste with cream cheese and strawberries are just a wonderful blend of flavor. I don't know why they call it salad when it could easily be served as dessert. I look for opportunities to make this.

My husband has been wanting me to make him pretzel dessert forever, so I tried this recipe. He loved it, so I guess it is a good recipe for "pretzel dessert" 
I myself did not like the jello topping at all! I peeled off the jello, and really liked the filling and crust. I guess the jello topping is a personal preference. I would not make this for company-but will make again for my husband.

So good! I made it day before and it turned out great.  I did reduce water like other's suggested and used the strawberries with the juice/sauce.

YUM!  I love this recipe! It is always a hit, but it does take a long time to make.  You have to be SURE you let each layer cool completely. The first time I made it, I didn't and it turned into a swirled-up mess!  Still delicious...but not right!  Take your time on this one and it will be awesome!

Absolutely FABULOUS recipe.  This has been my favorite for years.  It's also really good using raspberries in place of the strawberries.  This always gets rave reviews when I make it at family get-togethers.  And like many other reviewers, it's the first thing gone!

What a great dessert, Yummy!!  I made this for our "little" July 4th picnic, and it was awesome.  I loved it and so did my son.  I like the sweet strawberries combined with the salty pretzels.  My husband doesn't really go for the sweet and salty combo, but his loss.  Will definately make it again!  Thanks.

What a neat dessert!  We loved the combination of sweet strawberries and salty pretzels.  I was a bit lazy, though.  Instead of buying whipped topping and two packages cream cheese, my penny-pinching self bought two tubs of whipped cream cheese that were on sale.  I liked the taste of the cream cheese layer, sort of like carrot cake frosting, but would opt to add the topping as well next time.

This is tasty, although it is very sweet.  Next time I would double the jello because the layer was very thin  (or I would add the 2 cups of cold water that it instructs on the jello package, which is not in the directions).  Otherwise, a great side dish (or dessert).

Excellent recipe. Delicious! I used a 24 ounce container of frozen strawberries instead of the 16 ounce and cut the boiling water down to 1 cup instead of 2 cups. The crust and the cream cheese filling is perfect. There are a lot of different variations I want to try with this recipe. I think I might try raspberries with raspberry jello or peaches with peach jello. It is very tasty. I will be making this for our ladies salad supper at church. Thank you for sharing!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I found the cream cheese mixture a little too thick so I decreased it from 2 (8 oz) pkgs to 1, and added some vanilla for extra flavor. We also top it with Cool Whip for a fantastic dessert.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Tom!

Our family's favorite, and it tickles me that this recipe was submitted by someone with the same name as the grandmother I got the recipe from years ago (Judy)!  Tried this once with blueberries and it was also very, very good!

This was a big hit at my dinner party. I would call it more of a dessert than a salad. Delicious! And you could change it up a bit by using different flavored Jello/Fruit combinations.

Great recipe.  I left out the whipped topping from the cream cheese layer & added right before serving as a top layer.  Also read the other tips first about using Pam and using the cream cheese layer as a barrier to keep the pretzels from being soggy.  Also used frozen whole strawberries but pulsed through the food processor a bit first.  That way no big bites of strawberry.  Very yummy & a big hit for Fathers Day-we made 2 batches one for each side of the family.

Just made this today and wanted to review while still fresh in my mouth! I read some of the previous reviews and sprayed PAM on the dish first. I used fresh strawberries so I didn't have a problem with my jell-o setting up. Everything went smoothly. My 3 year old daughter loved to help crush the pretzels. As for taste .. was good but very sweet so when I make it again I will reduce the sugar and also the amount of butter for the crust (just too much). Overall, very good recipe just needs to be tweaked for personal tastes. Recommend.

Every time I have this dessert the pan comes home empty! It's my favorite, my friend's favorite - everyone I know LOVES it!! It's a great dessert to nibble on after the dinner/dessert dishes are cleared. Like when playing cards with friends... this is a wonderful treat to munch on all night!

So delicious.  I made to take to a ladies get together and it was a big hit.  Some had had versions of this before but said that the pretzels were soggy, on this recipe, they were nice and crunchy even the next day.  I used sliced frozen strawberries.  this is great to take to potlucks.

This was AWESOME!!!  I tried to make a recipe a lot like this one other time, and it didn't turn out.  I'm so glad I gave it another go with this recipe.  The flavors blend together to make a different but very good taste, and the jello and strawberries set up beautifully.  Thanks so much

Delicious!!  Made this for dessert on Easter and the entire family loved it!  Made the mistake of using a small box of jello instead of the larger size, but since I added fresh strawberries instead of frozen, it worked out fine anyway.  The sweet/salty pretzel crust is different and tasty...didn't have a problem with sticking as I sprayed the pan with cooking spray before pressing down the crust ingredients.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Tasted great but the pretzel crust stuck to the bottom of the pan. Next time I will try adding some Pam to the bottom of the pan.

Tasty. :9  I would categorize this as a dessert and not a salad, it made me think cream cheese pie when I bit into it.  Just really good and simple to make.
Took it to the relatives and it was a success.  The neighbors that came over for dinner even took some home.

I have added this tasty recipe to my Recipe Box and will be making again.

Served this at a party and the guests loved it!! I accidentally let the jello mix set too long in the fridge before spreading it over the cream cheese mixture, but it turned out fine.

also with this recipe you can use frozen "mixed berries" and any "berry" flavored gelatin (raspberry jello makes it more tart- but still great!)

This is a fantastic dessert!  I have made it several times, and always get asked for the recipe.  Especially the crust, they can't believe that it's made of pretzels.  This will be my potluck dish from now on! Thanks Tom!

The flavor of this dessert was wonderful. I'm just wondering if others are using presliced strawberries, stawberries in syrup, or what? I used whole frozen strawberries with no syrup. They got a little soggy. I'm still giving it 5 stars because it was delicious anyway.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I took this to a BBq today and it disappeared on no time. I used fresh strawberrys instead of frozen.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I'm going to play around with this with different flavored jell-os and different fruit.  Thnaks for sharing this great recipe.

THIS IS IT!!! The last 4th of July my mom was alive, she brought this yummy pretzely-cream cheesy-strawberry dessert to our bar-be-que. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to ask her for that refreshing, yummy recipe. How appropriate that I have found THE RECIPE (not an imposter, almost-but-not-quite-right version) almost a year later? Guess what I'll be bringing to the bbq this year? Thank you so much for sharing!!!

Good taste but jello set lopsided. Not very fond of strawberries in jello. Will try without fruit next time. Maybe even another flavor of jello. Pretzel crust did not become soggy.

What a strange yet incredible salad / desert!  This was so good - I am excited to try this pretzel crust with other recipes.  My crust didn't get soggy until about the 3rd day, so it will be great for a potluck.  Thanks for a keeper!

Our family loves this recipe, and it's a regular at family gatherings. We don't use "crushed pretzels," though, and our crust isn't soggy.

Put snack pretzels in a ziplock baggie, and bang on with something, or use your hands to break them up. You want them into what would be the equivalent of 1/3 or 1/4 the original length of the straight pretzels, or about 1/2 inch long.

This is by far THE most delicious jello recipe in existance! I have been making this recipe for 10 years and it is a favorite of everyone that tries it! I agree with others that it could be a dessert...but I can never wait that long! And it's great for breakfast the next day, too! Try it... you'll love it!

Excellent, just like what my mom used to make.  Actually, this cream cheese center seemed even richer than what I'm used to.  YUM.

I couldn't find crushed pretzel so I had to actually crush a cup and a half myself but boy! was it worth it! I actually did everything with a spoon since I just moved into a new apartment and didn't have the correct utensils to whip the cream cheese or crush the pretzels. 
The cream cheese center was rich but with the gelatin topping and the pretzel crust, the flavor all came together! My boyfriend tried it and absolutely LOVED IT!! I am actually really excited to share this recipe and have all my friends and family try it!

Pretzel Salad is so good it is addictive.  I fixed this dessert years ago and lost the recipe.  I was so happy when I found it again on allrecipes.com.  You can also use different flavored gelatins and fruit for a change.  Strawberry will always be my favorite!!

I loved this salad it tasted fantastic!!!!! However crushing the pretzels was a huge pain and a zip-lock bag did not help...Next time I will use gram crackers. Also I would let it sit for a day in the frigde it only improves with age..

This recipe was delicious.  I had my doubts about pretzels and strawberries combined, but it sounded so interesting I had to try it.  The pretzels don't even taste like pretzels once you make the crust.  The cream cheese filling balances out the sweetness of the strawberry topping.  Overall it was very, very good.  I will make this again.

Out of the 20 desserts available at our family picnic - this was the only one that went!  It went so quickly that those who missed it were upset!  Although I was initially skeptical - I recommend this very highly!!! You won't be disappointed.
