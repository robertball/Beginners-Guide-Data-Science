This was very good!  Next time I'll up the apples - perhaps 5 cups instead of 4.  Loved the flavors - as did the guests.  I would also like to try it with homemade crust.

This pie was wonderful!!!  I have to admit, I was a bit nervous when I was spreading the butter/brown sugar/syrup mixture in the bottom of the pie plate that it was going to stick and be a terrible mess.  After it came out of the oven, I couldn't figure out how to run my knife around the crust without breaking it so I just flipped the pie and crossed my fingers!  With a little tap to the bottom of the dish, the pie came out perfectly!!  Did not stick at all!  It was really tasty and my guests loved it.  Will probably make this one again for Thanksgiving :)

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  I didn't have any Karo syrup and used every day syrup.  It was still awesome.

This is an easy, wonderfully RICH dessert - a cross between apple pie and pecan pie!!  I wonder if it could be made successfully with other fruits, hmmmm

Wonderful pie, easy to make.  I also thought the glaze on bottom would stick, but when I took the pie out and used the knife to separate the edges it turned over perfectly.

This is easy to make (my first pie ever) and probably the best apple pie I ever tasted. It came out perfect and the whole family loved it!  I used Gala apples instead of granny smith because I like a sweeter pie.

I made this for Fathers' Day, and this is the best Apple Pie I've ever had, even my Dad (Who obsesses over apple pies and pecans) loved it, and this is his new favorite! A definite keeper, and oh so delicious! Thanks for sharing! And the best part (or not) was there was NO leftovers! This also goes great with icecream!

Made this for Rosh Hashanah dinner (Jewish New Year), for which apple desserts are tradition.  It was delicious.  Served it room temp, but I bet warm would have been really great.  Followed the recipe, one minor change was chopping the pecans up so they would be easier to serve and eat.

Pretty much fail safe recipe and it avoids the problem of a high crust with lots of air between it and the apples.  Nice change of pace from the standard apple pie.  I chopped the pecans to make it easier to slice and that worked out well - otherwise no changes needed.

delicious! I lined the pie plate with parchment so I did not have any difficulty getting it out. I flipped it about 5 minutes after taking it out of the oven, since so many people had warned about it sticking if you wait too long. However, I did have a bit of the juice from the apples seep out the vents and pool around the bottom of the now upside down pie. It ended up still being moist, so not a problem, just did not look quite as nice. Next time I might wait longer. I did not have corn syrup, so I used maple, could not really taste it. I think maybe the syrup serves another function, like smoothing out the brown sugar and butter. Mine was a little granular, but still totally delicious.

Excellent pie!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The wonderful, sweet juice runs out of the pie as it sits, so make sure your serving plate has a rim on it!  My plate was flat, and I ended up spilling hot syrup all over myself trying to transport the pie to a friend's for Christmas.  But once we got there, the pie was a huge hit.  I served it with whipped heavy whipping cream spiked with a little vanilla and almond extract for a punch.

This is one of the best pies I have ever made. Absolutely DELICIOUS! It is a keeper! I do prefer to make my pie crust from scratch, but that is the only difference.

Amazing! Was pretty easy to make and flavor was superb! I added about 2 tablespoons of butter cut into small pieces for the apple layer. Didn't last long!

This was super simple to make and absolutely amazing. I had about 5 1/2 cups of apples so I used them all and it was perfect... not too sweet and very flavorful... and I had the kids make it - they can't wait to have it again!

Make this exactly as directed! But let it cool before serving so that the top can glaze over a bit. It came out perfect... and I am a terrible baker! I used Pillsbury rolled pie crust (in the long red box). Tastes extra yummy warmed up with a little ice cream on top!

I only had one crust, so I put aluminum foil over the pie while baking it.  I flipped it over and it is still easy to serve without the second crust.  Tastes wonderful!  It is like a caramel roll with apples.

This was great! I used trakle instead of corn syrup because it's what I had on hand.
