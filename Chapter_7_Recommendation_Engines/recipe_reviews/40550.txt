This is similar to how I make mine.  Just a hint to those of you that complained of gooey, etc.  Heat the cream/milk and butter before mixing it.  Never use cold milk and butter.  I just heat it 30-60 seconds in the microwave when I'm ready for it.

I had a 10 pound bag of white potatoes, so I used them instead.  Peeled all but 5 in the bag and quartered them and cooked them on low until they were falling apart.  Drained, mashed and added salt & pepper, 2 sticks real butter, 4 oz cream cheese and heavy cream to get the consistency I wanted.  After mashing and beating with hand mixer, I put in my crock pot dotted with some more butter on low for 1-1/2 to 2 hours until the rest of the meal was ready.  They were the best mashed potatoes ever!

I thought these were great.  I left the potatoes a little lumpy because I like them that way and added the milk (I didn't have or need the cream) until they were just right.  Next time I will add a little garlic while the potatoes are cooking.

This recipe is how I typically make my potatoes with one exception -- normally I use milk and, honestly, I didn't notice a difference with the heavy cream.  Anyway, my trick for perfect mashed potatoes I learned from a chance viewing of a few minutes of Cooking with Emeril (or whatever it was called...) several years ago. He instructed to return the drained potatoes to the pot for a few minutes before adding the ingredients and mashing them. The heat removes the excess moisture. I didn't watch to see how he recommended mashing them but I have always used an electric mixer (now a stand mixer) and ever since I began following his method I have not had that gummy, gluey, watery, whatever-you-wanna-call-it it's yucky consistency. Give it a try!

Nope, you do not have to peel a red potatoe:) The skin is fleshy and add some health to that cream. I LOVE HEAVY CREAM. AND REAL BUTTER!!! The Russets I do peel. Find them even better than the overpriced Yukons. Irish girl here, and I do not like to do the dishes, pair of glove mits and pour off the water, return the spuds to the pan on the low burner, hmmm, excess moisture evaporates. Add my butter and the heavy cream to the potatoes in the same pan and let it bubble just a bit. Off of the burner and mash the old fashioned way. Aaaaah, these can not be beat by any chef!!!!! AND sometimes I even beef it up by adding White Cheddar.

Since being vegan, I tried this recipe with soy milk creamer, tasted like you used real half and half.  Plus it cuts down the fat drastically.

These are awesome.  I make these all the time for my husband who loves them.  I do add some garlic powder or roasted garlic to mix it up a bit.  Thanks for posting.  A keeper.

Holidays Only? Just substitute fat free dairy product for heavy cream and you can have them every day. I used 3/4 cup and 1t garlic powder. My family thought they were rich and creamy and went back for seconds. Thanks Nancy.

I'm sorry, but I didn't like these.  Maybe I should have mashed them by hand instead of using an electric mixer.  The texture was like adding elmer's glue!  Might try again using half & half instead of heavy cream and more butter.

The trick to avoid the "sticky" consistency is to drain potatoes well let sit a few minutes to dry some as the butter melts. Then add the cream a little at a time and mash or whip with a hand mixer till fluffy. No more gooey mashed potatoes.

YUM!  These were EASY... and delicious!  Everyone commented several times on how great these mashed potatoes were!  I did use the suggestion by another reviewer and warmed (not melted) the butter and warmed the heavy cream.  I haved used this method with sausage gravy as well and it really does make a difference.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe... oh I also added some fresh garlic to the potatoes and it was very good!

Excellent recipe.  The only thing I did was follow the advice of another reviewer and heated the heavy cream.  I will definately be serving this again.

Very good!  I did not have any heavy cream on hand, so I used Cool Whip as a substitute, and they were delicious!  Salt took the sweet edge off, and the potatoes were very fluffy, definately not gluey!  Thanks Nancy!  With the cool whip, you can enjoy these everyday!

Easy & delicious.  I normally make mine with 2% milk so this was quite a splurge but it does make them much creamier.  Definitely a special occasion ingredient!

Sooo GOOOOD! The only think i did different is I left the skins on the potatoes and added two teaspoons of minced garlic to the water as it was boiling... I sprinkled about a 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese in with the potatoes as I was mixing them. Thank you for sharing!

Change the potato for best texture!
Very good flavor but if you're getting a gooey texture, the potato is to blame, not you!  Use ONLY Russet Potatoes for the fluffy texture you want.  The 'waxy' varieties just don't work as well and they can very, very easily end up 'gluey'.  So don't use Red, White or any other color but the regular, brown, rough skinned potatoes that you would buy for baking.  And take it from me, born and raised in Idaho!  :)

I found the taste of these with cream to actually taste worse than with the no fat milk I usually use.  I might just be so use to nofat, but I would not make these again.

Very good, however they didn't taste much different than my usual mashed potatoes that require regular milk, as opposed to the heavy whipping cream.

I have not tried this recipe yet, it reads like mine though. However, as a fan of fresh over boxed, I have only ever experienced 'gluey' potatoes when using an electric beater. ALWAYS mash by hand. It's a good workout, or a great job for the teens waiting to eat. ; )

This is the normal way to have mashed potatoes. Now, if you want REALLY great mashed potatoes, mash with a large knob of butter and some cream, add some grated parmesan cheese and a few drops of truffle oil (black or white). Just eat and enjoy. Greatings from New Zealand

I halved the recipe and still used a little less heavy cream. Very good mashed potatoes - not the best I've ever had but they were very good. Yes, they're fattening but the good things always are. Went great with our baked chicken dinner. Thanks!

I had the same problem others had--the consistancy was much like elmer's glue (I followed the directions to a T)!!  These were simply too thick.  I think I'll stick to the normal milk and butter for my potatoes.

I tweaked the recipe a little bit by adding some spices (I am Indian and, not surprisingly, very fond of spicy food :P). I made this a couple of hours before serving and followed other reviewer's advice and kept it in a slow-cooker on low setting. The potatoes were creamy and delicious at the time of serving.

My husband often tells people he married because of my mashed potatoes.  I made these for Thanksgiving dinner, and well I think I just made my best ever mashed potatoes. My husband too really enjoyed them  I just wish the holidays came atleast 1 time per week, but not the calories.  Definately a keeper.    Yum-O

Using heavy cream and real butter makes this recipe very rich and fattening..but it's worth every calorie! It will taste even better by adding some fresh chopped basil and chives. We were licking our plates clean! (smile)

This recipe is delicious! I actually added 1 diced onion to the water while boiling the potatoes, then added a bundle of diced chives (just the greener area) and 8oz of shredded Mozzarella cheese! Wow!

I just scrub the potatoes and cube them leaving the peel on.  I also like to cook the potatoes in chicken bouillon.  When I do cook with the bouillon I have to be careful adding any addition salt.  Also, like some other reviewers I add garlic powder to taste.

These turned out great!!  I now cook my potatoes in the pasta insert of my stockpot.  I peel and quarter them into uniform sized pieces, add water to just below the colander/insert and steam them. They don't get mushy from boiling in water and their starches don't all wash away.  I think the texture is much better.

i followed the recipe, and these turned out very thick and kinda tasteless. I added some regular milk and more butter and they turned out pretty good. next time i would do half heavy cream and half milk, thanx for the recipe.

WONDERFUL!!!

I did, however, add a little more butter (about 2 teaspoons) and I also added a little bit of thyme and sage.
Fantastic!

The addition of heavy whipping cream made these mashed potatoes delicious!  I also followed another reviewers advice and returned drained, boiled potatoes to the pan for a few minutes before mashing. This is a great method for removing excess moisture which can cause your potatoes to be pasty.

I cut the russet potatoes in half as Chef John suggests and simmered (just under a boil) for approximately 20-25 minutes.  Better to be slightly undercooked.  Heat milk and butter to room temperature before using.

I am considered a pretty good cook. In recent years, I unhappily came to the conclusion that restaurants made better mashed potatoes than me. I asked chefs, friends, read many recipes and tried various methods but still could not master the simple mashed potato. Then FINALLY, I came across this recipe, the answer to my mashed potato dilemma. For better than mom used to make basic mashed potatoes, use this ratio of potato to heavy cream to butter. Highly recommended. Thanks Saltair4!

I make it the exact same with the alteration of Yukon gold potatoes instead.  In my opinion, those are the best potatoes for mashed potatoes as they have creamier texture.  I keep my red skins for roasting.  Yeah I'm odd, I use certain potatoes for certain recipes....I'm a texture nut. ;)

I found this recipe 5 years ago when cooking my first thanksgiving, and it has become a staple ever since.  I don't find them to be too rich at all, just a bit creamier than normal - which is excellent.

tastes like sticky mashed potatoes.. I'm sure I could have fixed the stickiness, but the flavor was really bland.. not rich or impressive.. just white mashed potatoes.  Husband wasn't a fan.  "Next time, can I just make the mashed potatoes?"-his exact words.

I just want to say this is a great recipe.  The only thing I did was to put some cheddar cheese in them.  The whole family loved them.  I had to double the amount too.  No left over at my house.

I normally make mashed potatoes with milk, butter, salt and pepper, and this pretty much tasted exactly the same, but with more fat.  I almost want to say it had less flavor, but that doesn't make much sense.

I use this same recipe for holidays, only I just use the butter to dot the finished dish and instead add two heaping tablespoons of mayonaise to give it more flavor because most people will add more butter anyway without tasting it. So why waste the butter especially on a holiday when it's needed more at the table and for other dishes.

I left some of the skin on the potatoes. The recipe is simple and does taste great but they were a little too thick for my preference. I think it recipe needed to add some milk to it just to smooth it out some.

This didn't taste any different than "normal" mashed potatoes, in spite of all the added calories and fat. Next Thanksgiving I'll use my normal recipe.

The texture of the mashed potatoes is perfect - so smooth! It is a little difficult, however, to add the correct amount of salt/pepper to taste with such a large amount...I just left it for each person to do on their own plate.

These were pretty good.  I used half&half instead of the heavy cream and a little less butter.  I think next time I will add parsley or maybe rosemary.  For special occasions I suggest using the heavy cream.

Since I make my mashed potatos this way every time I know they are good.....however after reading all the reviews I can't believe that no one adds at least 2-3 Tbsp.s of Minced Onion flakes!  I never make mashed potatos without them!  Sprinkle them in before you start to mash, pour the milk/cream over & let sit in the pot with lid on for 2 minutes, then mash as usual. Awesome!

These are good. I used a potato masher and added the butter. I then added the cream until it was the consistency I wanted; I didn't measure. I seasoned with garlic salt.

I've made this several times as written, and we all love these potatoes.  This year, however, I made them with a few addition, that didn't hurt a bit, just added a few handfuls more of calories.  I added a half pound or so of cooked and crumbled bacon, some sautéed mushrooms, garlic and onion.  Still incredible!  Didn't ruin them.  ??

These were delicious, but the texture was off. Not quite glue-y, a little stiff and just wasn't what I prefer. I followed the directions and measurements to the letter, making sure that my cream & butter were room temp and mashing by hand. They were good, but not fantastic.

These potatoes were amazing!  This has to be the first mashed potato recipe I've ever eaten and didn't NEED anything else on it, including salt.  I had to use margarine because of a picky eater that won't eat butter and they were still delicious.  I will absolutely make these again!

Used baked potatoes and the paddle on my kitchen aid mixer, since using baked potatoes instead of boiled added 1.5 cups of broth and 1/2 of sour cream. Fantastic would cook again.

My family really enjoyed these potatoes. This recipe makes a LOT, next time I will make a half-batch. I warmed the milk and butter and also rinsed the cooked potatoes as others suggested. My potatoes were not gummy - but I think that's more a factor of how fresh the potatoes are. I think potatoes get gummy if they have been sitting around too long. Buy firm potatoes, if they "give" when you squeeze them then they are too old - just like apples.

Super yum. If yours are sticky try cutting potatoes smaller and rinse them before you add the water to boil in. I'm no scientist but it seems to me more starch comes out while they cook and then you don't have paste potatoes.

Perfect! Couldn't ask for anything more when it comes to mashed potatoes. Super basic, but so delicious.

It was complete glue.  The potatoes were room temp and the cream was cold when I added it, so I believe that was the problem.  I wish I had read LONGN's review first to heat the cream/milk.  I would like to try it again with adding heated butter and milk to the potatoes while the potatoes are hot, just to see if that fixes it.

Oh, these potatoes are always sooooo worth the calories and fat. I really go to town and put in a stick of butter per 5 lbs of potatoes. I also use a whole carton of cream, a pint. This makes them a bit creamier than my mom likes them but just perfect for my husband. Mom can make her own! :)

I made these for Thanksgiving. I had high hopes for them, but they fell flat. They lacked flavor. I even tried to jazz them up with garlic and parmesan cheese, and they still didn't have a lot of taste. I didn't receive any compliments on them from my guests. I won't make these again, but thanks anyway!

I altered this recipe just a bit  by adding 8oz. of cream cheese.  The potatoes were INCREDIBLE and a huge hit with the family.

Very very very thick and rich potatoes. You definitely wouldn't want them all the time.

I really didn't notice a big change from our usual mashed potatoes.  It was creamier, but not necessarily better for adding all those calories.

The trick to these potatoes is only use red skinned potatoes. It makes all the difference. I also use a mixture of real butter and country crock.  Salt is a must too. These are definitely the best mashed potatoes ever!
