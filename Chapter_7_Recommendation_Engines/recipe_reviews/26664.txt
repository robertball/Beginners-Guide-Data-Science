This was pretty good but could have used a little more sauce.  I baked the meatballs in the oven on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet for 20 mins. at 400 deg. - it's easier than turning them in the saucepan and also collects any fat.

Yum! Better than the chinese restaurant. The only changes I made were: had no fresh ginger so added a few dashes of ground, and had no green bell pepper so used a yellow one instead. Adding beef bouillon to the meatballs was tasty; I had never tried that before, and they were awesome. The sauce was great too; thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: Made this again using fresh ginger...much tastier! Although this time I was short on time and used Simek's mini beef meatballs, not as good. I prefer using pineapple tidbits, other than that this recipe needs no tweaks!

OMG!!!  This is an excellent dish!!!  I invited friends over and made these meatballs for them.  I followed the directions EXACTLY and got perfect results!  The sauce was just right (not too thick, not too thin).  I used ground ginger because I didn't have fresh ginger on hand (just eyeball it).  The meatballs are EXCELLENT served over egg noodles (I prefer noodles instead of rice).  Serve with a tossed salad and cold applesauce on the side.  These meatballs are very versatile and can be served with a variety of sauces (i.e. Bar-B-Q sauce or brown gravy - just omit the pepper and pineapple!) to change things up a bit.  This recipe is a winner for sure.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

AMAZING!!!  I changed the recipe a little--I didn't have beef bouillon, so that wasn't added at all.  For the meatballs I used 1.2 lbs ground turkey and only added 1/3 cup bread crumbs and added a dash of soy sauce and minced garlic.  I then cooked the meatballs about 3/4 of the way through in a little bit of canola oil before I added the sauce.  I made the sauce exactly how it said minus adding the pineapple chunks at the end.  It was absolutely delicious!!  I served it over rice!  You could add additional veggies to make it a meal--onions, water chestnuts, pea pods, etc.  Overall--DELICIOUS!

I made these meatballs for Thanksgiving.  We have some in the family who aren't crazy about turkey.  I made a double batch and followed the recipe as is , except that after the meatballs were cooked I dumped everything in a crockpot to cook. These turned out great and my husband has already requested them for our family Christmas party.

Very good!  I really liked the sauce, although I might add a little more pineapple juice next time.  Not too sweet and not too sour!

This meal was pleasant in many ways, although there was not enough juice to our liking. The flavor was splendid! I made this with my grandson, Noah. It was our first endeavor cooking together. We will do more cooking!!! We would recommend this to everyone! We did replace the brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar and no one could tell. It is our secret!!!

I doubled this recipe and used ground pork instead of beef  I partialy cooked the meatballs then threw them into the slow cooker with the sauce on low for about 4-5 hours and it came out great!  My whole family loved it.

I used ground turkey instead, came out fine. Served over egg noodles. Next time I will figure out a way to make extra "sauce" from the pineapple juice, because more would have made it more 'stroganoff-y" which we would have preferred.Overall, we liked it and will probably make it again.

I made this for a luau last week and everyone raved about it.  It competed with a variety of other foods, but these meatballs were the hit!  We put everything (but the peppers and pineapple chunks) into a crock pot and left it on high for maybe an hour (until it hit a boil) then switched it to low, added the peppers and pineapple, and kept it there for several hours during the party.  I altered the amount to serve 20, so, if putting this in a crock pot, keep an eye on it!

My husband is not a huge fan of sweet and sour, but he loved this.  It's a nice mild, beefier sweet/sour that is just wonderful.  Turned out just perfect over brown rice.  Thanks!

I really wanted to like this recipe... it smelled good while cooking, but we just didnt like it.  It was WAY too tart for us.  We dont like overly sweet dishes, but this was much too tangy for our tastes.  With that said, I did really enjoy the texture of the meatballs, so I think I'll use the meatball recipe with a different sauce.

I decided to use this recipe to serve to several guests at a dinner party. It was pretty easy to make and came out wonderful. I served the meatballs over white rice and everyone enjoyed them meatballs. I will definately be adding this recipe to my favorites to make again.

This was tasty but I did change it a bit. I didn't have pineapple on hand so I used cranberry sauce instead. I also used onion powder instead of onions in the meatballs. It thickened nicely with the cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water. I recommend that you don't use whole cranberry sauce but the jellied type. I enjoyed it and will do it again but probably with the pineapple!

This was fantastic! I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 just because I personally like more sauce and had to add more pineapple juice and brown sugar.

Very easy, forgiving and delicious recipe. My small children enjoyed, and they are quite picky. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, but otherwise followed pretty closely. I was in a hurry and just eye-balled the measurements and it turned out great. This will be a regular! Thanks for the recipe.

i really liked the meatballs in this recipe. i only put in a few onions adn i put about a 1/4 cup of parsley. they were reall good. i added extra pineapple juice to the sause and didnt add more cornstarch, so it was a bit runny but that was my own fault. over all this wasn't the best recipe (except for the meatballs, delicious)but was still pretty dang good.

Very nice meatballs, I only omitted the green peppers since nobody in my family likes them.  I was thinking of next time adding a few more veggies, like snow peas and maybe celery what do you think?

I was looking forward to this but it just didn't hit my family's taste buds.  Not sure why, followed the recipe, just doubled the sauce as there was not enough in this recipe.

They were just OK. I made it once and it was edible, but I wouldn't go through the trouble to make it again.  I think there could be more sauce like other reviewers also.

I chose this recipe over Lana's Sweet and Sour Meatballs at the suggestion of one reviewer and I'm glad I did.  It was fairly simple and I had the ingredients. I did add a little black pepper & a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the ground beef mixture because we like heat.  Next time, which will be soon, I'm going to double the sauce.  Our guest was impressed.

Although I doctored up my meatballs by adding  garlic pepper,  onion powder, garlic salt, I made the sauce exactly as written, I also threw in maraschino cherries for color. It was delish. Served it over rice & loved it.

This was really good!  I had to make some changes out of necessity though, and I think they worked in my favor. I used ground ginger, about 2 tsp, apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice, and then when I read someone say more sauce would've been nice, I added an extra 1/4 c of AC vinegar, and 1/4 c water.   I chopped 2 stalks of celery and simmered that in with the meatballs and sauce so they'd be soft once everything was cooked. I didn't add the peppers, and used tidbit pineapple, and I served with egg noodles. Husband gave it a thumbs up, and so do I.

I followed the recipe as written, and the such was very good, but I found the meatballs to be rather bland. They need something to kick them up...bread crumbs, onion and beef broth just didn't do it.
