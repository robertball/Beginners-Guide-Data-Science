These are amazing. Trust me. But you left out one thing, hence the 4 stars. Before eating you have to dip it in milk. If you don't believe me you just need to watch UHF a few more times.

This seems like it'd be a really bad pregnancy craving. I gave it to a coworker who choked it down, and then said it needs more cheese. Thanks but no thanks.

At first glance this seems really unappealing.  At first taste, it’s really not bad!  I think Weird Al was on to something.  The only mistake I made was going upscale on the wiener using a Boar’s Head wiener with a natural casing – it’s a little hard to bite into and tends to pull it apart.  Should have stuck with a simple Oscar Mayer wiener which would have made this really good instead of just pretty good.  I would best describe this as a dessert with a little meat.  Once you get by the ingredients and try it as a snack you’ll be pleased.

Sadly, as the guy who posted this recipe - I CANNOT make this, due to missing one key ingredient...

For some odd reason, they ONLY sell Aerosol Spray Cheese in the US - it is NOT available to us Canucks!

If I ever get my hands on a can of it - I WILL give these a try (and update this review).  But then again, this is the same guy who used to eat bagels with Cream Cheese on one half, and Peanut Butter on the other ;););)

A clever sandwich for a clever man.  My husband really likes to eat these, not everyday, more like once every leapyear, he says they are a cured meat sensation.  He tried to get me to take a bite, but the smell of the processed cheese squirt, made my stomach gurgle in a very unpleasant way.  While slicing the twinkie in half to make a bun for the weiner is the traditional manner of making these I think cutting the the weiner and twinkies into bite size pieces and skewering them on a bamboo stick (twinkie wiener kebab, anyone?) could really uplevel this treat.  You could plan a fun UHF party around these, also add in a wheel of fish (sushi rice krispie treats), flying poodle cookies, ghandi's steak bites (pioneer woman has a recipe), mashed potato mountains, Yappy's dog treats, etc.  the appetizer options are freaking limitless!  Thanks again for the recipe!

You get 5 stars for the UHF reference.  Make this at your next party and "supplies" your guests.

UHF forever!  Oddly enough, the sweet and savory actually work very well together and this isn't as repulsive as it sounds. I heard Weird Al still eats these except with vegetarian hot dogs as he converted to vegetarianism since his UHF days.

You gotta get more stars just for resurrecting this "recipe" and passing it around. I can't believe some people actually tried to eat these, though. Rock on, "Weird Al" fan, rock on!

I'll admit, I'm giving this more four stars for being a "Weird Al" Yankovic reference from his film "UHF", since I am somewhat of a fan of his.

Having said this, as a joke I did just try it today.  It's...not wonderful, no.  But it's not as bad as one might think it could be.  Is it healthy?  I doubt it.  :)  If one ignores the UHF reference, then I'd rate it 3 stars and call it something to try once.

As an aside, I do wonder if any of the one star reviews tried this, or just decided it was disgusting based only on description.  If I think I'd hate something but haven't tried it, I won't review it.  That to me is very unfair, even for a "joke" recipie from a movie like this.

Love that you put this on here!  Love Weird Al!  This truly is disgusting!  Especially dipped in a cup of milk!  But no self-respecting Weird Al fan can complete their life without having this once!

please, don't use easy cheese with this!  In this case, velveeta is better.  In fact, I would double the amount of velvetta, because this recipe is sooo cheesy:)

This is so cool!  I love the idea, and I will try it just as soon as I can get my hands on some Twinkies.  Maybe I'll make one of these the next time I'm having hot dogs;)

I gave this recipe a try. The first one was pretty good and the second was palatable. But the third one I couldn't finish. One warning: use the plainest dogs you can find. I used Wranglers the first time and plain ones the next. The plain were a lot better. I've made these a few times now just for a change of menu.

This is an amazing dish inspired by an amazing man. When I first heard Weird Al created this fine food I knew I had to make it myself, and one day I did indeed. Suprisingly enough, I enjoyed it! It is a very tasty treat. Don't let the looks or ida of it fool you, it isn't bad at all! Thank you Weird Al!

Ok, so it's not "good."  To be honest, it tasted...exactly like you would expect. But for the comedy factor alone, it was worth it.  I served mine with a side of mashed potatoes sculpted into miniature Devil's Towers and, of couse, a glass of milk for dipping, while UHF played in the background.
