Very fast and easy alternative to plain brussels sprouts. The crumbs don't really stick, so I sprinkle some extra on top. The added flavor is a nice change. I like these with crushed garlic croutons too.

I haven't tried this recipe but my mother used to make this when I was a kid, except she added some minced garlic.  Maybe this recipe is the reason I grew up loving brussel sprouts!

My husband and I don' like mushy brussel sprouts so I sauted them instead of boiling, letting them steam alittle and then followed the directions.  That being said we did not enjoy the flavor or the texture of these at all.  It kinda felt like sand covering your brussel sprouts and I don't think it lended to much flavor to the end product considering Brussel Sprouts have such a strong flavor on their own.

For a non-brussel sprout lover like me, these were pretty good.  Hubby, who does like them, loved these.

super easy and even those who don't like brussel sprouts did not complain.  Changed it up the second time and did 1/2 cup bread a d 1/2 cup parmesan cheese.
