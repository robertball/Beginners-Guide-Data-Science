This is a tasty, fresh recipe.  Changes:  Use half the amount of pasta called for.  1 lb. is way too much.  1/2 lb. for 4 servings is perfect.  I used whole wheat spaghetti and my family loved it.  Use "Nature's Sweet" tomatoes or some type of sugar plum tomatoes - you really need quality tomatoes since this is such a major ingredient.  I used twice the amount of fresh cilantro.  Use 1-2 teaspoons of fresh basil - much better than dried.  I put about 1/4 the amount of sugar, based on another reviewer's recommendation and thought it was fine - probably didn't need any, actually.  I echo the other reviewer's rec of using high quality extra virgin olive oil. Also, definitely add chicken. I used fresh Parmesan as well - delicious touch. I served with some warm crusty sourdough bread and steamed broccoli and it was a perfect meal!  My husband, who usually prefers tomato ground beef sauce, loved this fresh recipe!

I really liked this, It would be better for summer than winter, but we would suggest to cut down the amount of sugar by a little (it was a little sweet) use a very high quality extra virgin oil, and add a chicken breast so it will fill you up more.

This is a tasty and different side dish.  When I went to get my tomatoes I found out that I only had one smallish tomato so I used that and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies that I had in my pantry. I think the green chilies were a nice addition since they brought a little bit of pop to the dish. And since I had to use canned tomatoes I left out the sugar. I will make this again.

This was good, but unfortunately, I didn't have fresh ingredients on hand. Therefore, the tomatoes were from a can, and the cilantro was dried. I would do this again but with fresh ingredients. Thanks Rachel.

On the bland side and not particularly filling.  Not too bad though.  Makes for something really quick and easy.

I was looking for a side to serve with Light Chicken Piccata (from this site.).  This dish was easy and awesome!  I cut it by half (only two of us), and it still made a LOT.  I almost used canned diced tomatoes, but chose to stick to the recipe -- good thing because the fresh tomatoes added a complimentary texture than the mooshy canned tomatoes certainly would not.  The only thing I will change next time will be adding more cilantro.  So good.

I splashed in some red wine vinegar when I added the olive oil to up the flavor.  The cilantro added an interesting and yummy kick.  This was a little different than my usual weeknight pasta dishes, thank you for sharing Rachel!

This pasta has a really light, fresh flavor.  I added parmesan cheese to make it a bit tangier and put in more cilantro than the original recipe called for (trying to use it up).  In the future I think I would add a lightly breaded chicken breast for a little filler and texture.
