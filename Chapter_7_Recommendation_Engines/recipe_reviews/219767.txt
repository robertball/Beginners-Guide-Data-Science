This is by far better than other alfredo sauces I have tried - those end up being greasy or the butter and cream separating. I used real parmagiano-reggiano and asiago instead of fontina. 

I served this with farfalle pasta, grilled chicken breasts that were thinly sliced, 6 slices of julienned bacon that I rendered until crisp, I sauteed chopped onion and the minced garlic in the bacon drippings -- drained all of those and set it aside. I also diced 3 roma tomatoes and wahed 3 cups of fresh baby spinach. 

I made the alfredo sauce in a large, deep skillet and when it was done I added the al dente pasta. Then I added the sliced chicken breast, bacon, onions, garlic, tomatoes and spinach. I stirred the ingredients until combined, covered the skillet and brought it up to temperature on low heat, stirring occasionally until the spinach was wilted. 

Delicious doesn't even come close to describing the meal - much better than I've eaten at any chain Italian restaurant... and the sauce was the star!!

OMG! I knew this was greatness after my first taste. I omitted the fontina cheese and used a Parmesan, Romano, asiago blend instead and salted butter.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly; cutting everything in half to make a smaller portion. I felt like a rock star when I was done, and I was stuffed when my bowl was empty.  I put the sauce on farfalle pasta with grilled chicken, spinach and mushrooms.  This was better than what I would have gotten in a restaurant.  Now when I have a craving for some pasta Alfredo, I can just make it at home.  I can't wait to try it with some shrimp and fettuccine. This really is a fabulous recipe.

I am an alfredo sauce junkie and I absolutely LOVED this recipe! This is by far the best alfredo sauce I've had (including fancy Italian places). Definitely very rich (ok, fattening!)and should be reserved for special occasions, but SO worth it! I made crab alfredo using this sauce for my new husband on Valentines's Day and it was perfect! Nothing says "I love you" like crab alfredo! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made many an alfredo sauce in my lifetime and this is the VERY BEST!  OUTSTANDING!  The key is cooking it slowly and baby it a little.  It takes time but it is so worth it!

I have been looking for a recipe like this for decades!  I have been trying to emulate the alfredo sauce from my favorite Italian restsurant, but could never get it quite right.....until I found this recipe.  You need look no further if you want out-of-this-world alfredo sauce!  This sauce is the real deal. If you are going to have "heart attack on a plate," you may as well spoil yourself and go with the best. I stirred a bag of fresh spinach into the sauce and served it over fettuccine noodles.  So rich and so filling.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

This was very good.  I did 1/4 of the recipe since I only needed a small amount.  Added several good twists of freshly ground sea salt and black pepper and several dashes of dried basil; left out the fontina and used a little water instead of the whole milk.  Also used 1 clove garlic, finely chopped, instead of minced garlic.  Delicious!! :)

Amazing! Since I was only making it for two, I made 1/4 of the recipe and I still have leftovers. This is the best Alfredo I've ever tasted. Also, I did not find it necessary to simmer it an extra 20-30 min. I took it off the heat, then added the cheese and all the cheese melted just fine. Oh, I used asiago cheese in place of both cheeses so maybe that made a difference.

I made this for the first time last night and it was great!! Added a few things... When I added the garlic, I also added onions. I couldn't find fontina cheese so I used muenster cheese. Finally, I had some left over chicken, so I chopped it up and threw that in too. Served it over fettuccine noodles, with one of my green bean recipes as a side dish, and the family just about licked their bowls. I'll have to agree with tami1968, this is a very rich recipe so I'll have to use it on special occasions or find another recipe not so high in fat.

The base recipe itself tastes AMAZING! I did tweak it just a tad by adding fresh mushrooms, though. I would make one minor adjustment to the overall recipe, whether you add mushrooms or not.....add just a little more flour, as the consistency was a bit thin.

I made this for my husbands birthday dinner, and instead of traditional fettuccine pasta, I made it with three cheese tortellini, served with grilled chicken breast. I think I could have ate the sauce alone, though, because it was so delicious!


*Edit: I've noticed in a few reviews where people complain that the parm doesn't melt and/or leaves a gritty texture; make sure you use FRESH parmesan and shred it yourself....not the stuff in a jar.

Other than using salted butter instead of unsalted, I followed this to a "t". We thought it was very good. We have another that we do like better that uses parm & romano but I'd def use this recipe again if I happened to have fontina around. Thanks, Crystal!!

I really wanted to love this recipe, but it just didn't work out as I hoped.  I followed the recipe, and it was indeed rich and buttery, but the Parmesan cheese never melted.  It tasted great (which is why I'm giving it 3 stars), but the cheese left a gritty texture.  My husband works late so I put some aside some for him and he was not impressed at all.  He said it reheated poorly and the sauce separated making it unpalatable.   It's a good basic recipe, but next time I'll leave out the Parmesan and use it to garnish, or use a different cheese, and less butter to prevent the sauce from breaking down during reheating.

I made the most wonderful pink sauce from this.  I halved this  recipe  and then mixed in half a jar of pasta marinara sauce (about 12 oz).  My kids and I were raving about how delicious it was.

This was AWESOME!!  I split the cheese using half fontina & half Parmesan.  Love fontina cheese!  I also added sautéed chicken that I cooked with garlic, Cayenne pepper & crushed red pepper.  We love spicy food in my house.  My husband ate it all up & asked when are we having this again.  Next time I'll add broccoli to it with the chicken & pasta.

Great sauce, makes a huge amount, love it. To help with the separation issues people are having just make sure you using low heat and your whisking a lot and even reheating just low heat and whisk and it'll go right back together.

Wow!!  This really was the BEST Alfredo sauce I've ever made.  I think the Fontina was the winning combo.  I did add some fresh chopped basil from my garden!  Yum:)

My goodness, this is delicious! I’m glad I chose this recipe to try! There were only a couple things I had to change. I cut the recipe in half (because it’s just me eating it) and used salted butter. I also used corn starch instead of flour, because I have celiacs and can’t have gluten. For this, I did 1 TBLS of corn starch mixed with a little bit of water, and poured the mixture in with the cream. For the cheese, I did a Parmesan/ Romano cheese mix (it was on sale), along with the fontina. This is restaurant grade sauce! For the complete meal, I mixed mushrooms and spinach into the sauce, and had it with sautéed shrimp and chicken over some gluten free rotini. I stuffed myself, it was so good!

very creamy alfredo sauce, the only difference is i added 8 tablespoons of flour in the beginning to make a roux. the fontina melted quite well which surprised me.  i used this alfredo sauce to make seafood lasagna. great recipe

This is good. First I used 1/4 cup of olive oil and caramelized 2 Tbls of minced onion and 1 tbls minced garlic in it. I used mixed in the flour , remaining butter and cream at this point. (No boiling. If you break down the butter until it bubbles then it will separate.) Once the sauce was slightly thickened and hot, not to simmering point, I mixed in 6 oz. of Italian mix cheese and 4 oz. of Parm. The sauce was thickened once it cooled slightly. If you boil your cheeks and butter it breaks down the sauce, making it chunking. I saw some reviews on here saying it did not reheat well and wanted to say if you make this correctly it is just as creamy reheated as when first cooked. A simple rule of thumb: DO NOT BOIL CHEESE! lol

i absolutley LOVED this recipe. I made it for my man and he loved it as well as i. Instead of fontina cheese i used asiago and added about 2 more ounces each of the two cheeses. Also i would go lighter on the salt and pepper next time. (personal preferance) HIGHLY recommend this amazing recipe DEFINITELY will make this again and again

Absolutely amazing. I've made it for my entire family, and they all love, say it's even better that a restaurant! After getting out all of the ingredients, I just eye-balled everything, it's  one of those recipes that you don't have to follow exactly. I recommend it 100%.

This is sooooooo good!  I made it tonight for my 16 yr old food critic,  I didn't melt/blend the cheese long enough. so he said it was "powdery".  My bad there.  I added shredded mozzerella because i didn't have fontina.  Would SO make this again and again!!!!

This was so easy and turned out delicious! I couldn't find fontana so I used parmigiano reggiano. I also added bacon and roasted red peppers to the sauce after it was finished. The next day, I found that the butter in the sauce separated but I added some milk and more cheese to try and thicken it back up.

This sauce is fantastic.  Well worth the work and the wait.  I halved the recipe, omitting the milk because it would have just been a splash, and kept the garlic level the same.  Hubby and I couldn't keep the spoon out of it waiting for it to thicken.  I even had it nearly boil a couple of times but was able to cool it down quick enough to avoid any grainy texture.  All over a very forgiving and very tasty recipe.  We will use it again.

Best Alfredo Sauce ever!!! Followed the recipe exactly, no need to change a thing. It came out better tasting than any restaurant sauce I've ever tried. I think the fontina cheese is what makes it taste so wonderful.

It turned out great. Only change I made was I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic as I had no fresh garlic cloves and I used half n half for the milk. The parmesan cheese melted just fine. It did take a little time about 20 min of stirring. The consistency was right on point and the flavor was great. The family loved it and so did I. Will make it again.

I halved the recipe because it makes so much. I used 2% milk and three cheese blend, only because that is what I had on hand. It turned out excellent. Consistency was very good, not too thick. Great flavor. Next time I will probably decrease the butter, about 1/2- 3/4, it was a little buttery, but I like butter; so it was ok. Definitely a keeper.

I accidentally bought only 2 cups of heavy cream so I subbed the rest with whole milk. I added a little extra flour to thicken it bc of that.  It still turned out really well.  I agree with the other review that you def. have to take your time with this recipe. I paired it with broccoli & fettuccini.

Not a cheese-lovers sauce. I thought this was going to be delicious because of all the rave reviews. This was indeed creamy but BLAND! I recommend at least tripling the cheese to get any sort of flavor. Don’t know why this has so many good reviews. Very disappointed because a lot of work went into the sauce.

The easiest & best! Vary your cheeses according to preference or availability but keep in mind, the depth comes from that flavor of aged, fresh grated, cheeses! Spend that extra dollar and get the deli section variety of Italian cheeses. It makes all the difference??! BTW, used 1/2 ghee, 1/2 bacon grease for butter, added spinach, half & half, & omitted milk. This is addicting!! May “up the garlic” next time, 4 cloves for halved recipe. WOW!!!!

I’m giving it 3 stars b/c of the consistency + I don’t care for Alfredo sauce w/ cream cheese. Also.. 2 days later the sauce is still good to go-no greasy separation. Fresh parmesan cheese a must!! I had both packaged & fresh on hand and didn’t want to repeat past mistakes so went with the fresh. I subbed mozzarella for fontina, that’s all I had on hand. I was so paranoid it would separate so I kept it on low just under a simmer. It was not grainy nor did it separate. A lot of whisking.... Alas, as another review said It was bland, I added white pepper 2x,+black pepper+salt..all by eye and tasted each time I added. Everything else was by the book! ( *had to use skim milk*) I Had 2 hungry ppl to feed and was getting nervous. I added 1/4 cup pesto sauce...bland-then another 1/4 cup, Of course everyone’s palette is preferential of the added amount. If I honestly thought nutmeg would have made the sauce,I’d have added it, I wasn’t willing to go into uncharted waters and just go crazy w/ it and have Alfredo Nog. In the end It yielded 2 cups of a beautiful consistency sauce. BE prepared to ADD ANYTHING you would want for flavor. I didn’t find it to taste buttery at all. Just like hot cream sauce. FYI Salted butter won’t make it too salty either. It’s as bland as bland could be the pesto made for good rescue. But I wanted Alfredo, perhaps more sharp cherse? Asiago + more? Will make again.. Video was a great guide to know how to prep. Thank You !!

This sauce was excellent!! I received several compliments!  My grocery store did not have fontina, so I had to use gruyere. It does make a very large portion.

I made it gluten free!  Excellent recipe, my entire family loved it and we think it tastes as good as our favorite Italian restaurant.  We followed the recipe exactly and next time may reduce the salt a little bit.  We served it over mushroom ravioli.  Fantastic!  It was easy to make.  Cooking this sauce in a 3Qt saute pan / skillet with a lot of surface area made it go faster.   Patience and medium low heat and constant slow and easy whisking was the key.   I used a gluten free all-purpose flour instead of regular flour.  It thickened perfectly.

Excellent!  Used Asiago because our local market doesn’t have fontina. So smooth!  Added chicken, shrimp and broccoli.

A note to the chef:
Fabulous recipe, thank you for sharing. To the people said it was burnt- check your burner heat, it was too high. (There is a reason the chef said SIMMER, not BOIL) To those that said it was greasy and separated- whisk CONSTATLY for 10 minutes is an important part of the recipe instructions .  Those that changed every ingredient, just stop!

Simply the best alfredo sauce I have ever had, better than olive garden anyway. Guaranteed to please any one who loves alfredo. 

Use the good cheese and shred it yourself. With cheaper generic processed cheese it is not as good. 

Caution, you will never go back to the bottle of alfredo you get in the store, its ruined forever if this is done right with the good cheese. It is fairly easy to make as well.

Wow!!!  Thankyou very much... i made it pretty much as the recipe, except I didn't have cream so I used whole milk, and increased the garlic.  I defer to my initial comments, it's amazing.

I'll be trying a gf version for a good friend of mine and will check in again...

I made this “as is”, it’s a stand on its own recipe without changes. I was pleasantly surprised to the creaminess and how the flavor held up to adding chicken, broccoli, and mushrooms.... I love simple recipes. Thank you!

Great recipe. I used a combination of heavy cream and half and half as that is what I had in the house. Turned out very well. I also sauteed a scallions and garlic along with chicken and white wine. The above was served over spaghetti squash.

Oh my goodness! My wife & I decided to give up on the jarred Alfredo sauce and just go for it. This recipe is the bomb...easy and delicious! I substituted Gouda for fontina because the nearest store with fontina was over an hour away. 
We have really missed genuine Alfredo sauce!

Overall, this is a great recipe. I have made this sauce several times, and it has come out fantastic each time. The sauce is rich, creamy, and smooth, and sticks to the pasta very well.

I did make a few modifications (Romano instead of Fontina and also added slightly more cheese and a bit more garlic to match the tastes of myself and my family), but nothing that would really alter the recipe too drastically.

As others have mentioned, it does not separate, and also reheats well, both on the stove and in the microwave.

One tip for those who said the cheese didn't melt and/or was grainy: Use fresh grated/shredded cheeses. The dry cheese that you shake over pasta doesn't always melt well, and also usually has wood pulp (cellulose powder) in it that cannot melt. Use the fresh stuff and you will notice a big difference.

I used Parmesan and gruyere cheese and this sauce turned out fabulous! Served it to friends and family and all loved how creamy it was. Definitely a keeper.

This was very good. I think it needs a little more flavor...maybe more garlic...hard to tell. I'm not the most patient person in the world so I also think it took too long to make and required too much attention! 
Overall, I may make it again. It was a nice sauce and I did get compliments from guests.

Delicious, by far the best alfredo sauce i have ever had. It doesnt reheat well at all. Im going to try to reheat leftover sauce over a double boiler next time. The only change I made was that I used asiago instead of fontina because I couldnt find fontina.

Because of the reviews, I only used 1/2cup of butter (1stick). I used an 8oz wedge of parm and a 5oz wedge of fontina. I shredded them finely. I ended up adding and additional tablespoon of flour. The sauce did not separate.  I refrigerated the leftover sauce, it basically became solid. Reheated on the stove on low, it reheated beautifully. The best Alfredo sauce I’ve ever had! Oh, I served it over angel hair pasta with fried eggplant and pan grilled thin chicken breast, delish!

Perfectly deliciously decadent and much easier to prepare than the recipe suggests!!! Loved the thick, smooth, velvety consistency too. Only had freshly grated Parm Cheese, so just used that. The trick is to keep whisking on medium low heat. Didn't need to cook anywhere close to 30minutes; under 20 minutes was enough.

Delicious.  Before I add any cheese to a cheese sauce I add a pinch of sodium Citrate.  Chefs use this to prevent separating, and it does work.  If you can not find it locally, it is available at Amazon.  Also,  do not ever let the sauce boil.

With all of the butter and cream, a very rich dish of course. It seemed to be missing something. We all added salt once it was served with the pasta, but it still needed something. My sister added nutmeg to the leftovers so we'll see how that does.

Rich and delicious. I made this to top lobster ravioli for a holiday meal and it was perfect. I've tried numerous times to find an Alfredo sauce recipe that actually tasted like what you're served in an Italian restaurant but I'd had no luck until this one. No corners cut with here. Perfect! The serving size says it's for eight but that would be eight generous servings. Could easily serve 12, I believe.

Went a little light on amount of butter and heavy cream, used more milk instead.  Still very tasty and rich. Added a few red pepper flakes and ground nutmeg.  Very good. Will make again.

This was a fantastic alfredo sauce, we ended up using parmesan and asiago instead because that's what I had, but I think next time I'll try the other cheese. Either way VERY GOOD!!! We are also going to try to freeze the left sauce in ice cube trays for later because there were only two of us eating and it defiantly could have served 8 like it said!

My seven year old great granddaughter and I made this beautiful sauce along with cajun shrimp.  Watching her shred the cheeses and whisk the sauce made it the best we ever tasted.  I did use yogurt butter and non fat milk but the whipping cream is so rich it made no difference.

I made this recipe with a few modifications and it came out perfect.  Instead of the parmesan cheese I used a parmesan/romano blend.  I also used salted butter (then didn't need to add salt later).  I also added a little more cheese and flour to thicken it up.  I didn't have any issues with the cheese not melting or separation, etc...

Delicious! Half the recipe will be pretty much enough for 1 lb of fettuccine unless you want the pasta drenched in sauce, in which case you will want 3/4 of the recipe. I subbed half and half for cream and used 3/4 c Parmesan and 3/4 c grated Romano in place of fontina and it was still excellent. I have also made this recipe with fontina as directed and also delicious. Definitely use fresh garlic for best taste.

This is an awesome recipe. I made it without any changes. It really tastes close to Olive Garden Recipe. We never have leftovers! Thanks for a fan favorite in our hosehold.

I call this a heart attack on a plate.  Yet it is sooooo good.  I make it as written.  I do cut up cooked chicken breasts and mix it  with the sauce, then serve over spaghetti.

The only thing I did differently is use garlic powder as I did not have minced.

Delicious. I used half the salt and pepper and that was plenty. Also doubled the flour and I think this sped up the thickening process. Stirred in a 5-ounce bag of baby spinach just before serving. This is enough sauce for 2 pounds of farfalle pasta and would easily serve 5 or 6 people.

This is so good. Its hard to find a recipe without cream cheese and this one is tasty. I couldn't find fontina so I subbed provolone and it came out pretty dang good. I'm making veggie lasagna with it. Mmmmm

This Alfredo sauce was delicious even though I didn't add the fontina (none on hand). I've tried other recipes in the past but I think letting it simmer for 20-30 minutes made the difference.  And this sooo much better than jarred sauce.

Very delicious. Nice creamy sauce. I made it once with the amount of butter the recipe called for then the next time cut down on the butter. Tasted the same just a little less greasy.

I read all of the reviews and could not deny trying a five star recipe. It did not disappoint! My husband said it was the best Alfredo he had ever eaten and I agree. While time intense it is so worth the wait. I did half it for 4 of us and had some leftovers.

I followed the recipie, with the exception of whole milk.I used 1% milk. After the sauce was done cooking , I added 3 handfuls of  Dungeness Crab. This sauce is exceptionally delicious.I served over Linguine and a simple lettuce salad.When you are making it, do not walk away from the stove, you need to be attentive to stirring. My family loved it!

Combine this with some shrimp and you've got yourself a dang good meal! It worked perfectly! My only complaint is that it took quite a long time (about 30m) to reach the desired consistency.

I cut the recipe in half since I was only making dinner for two. Since I love garlic I will put more garlic in it when I make it next time. Really loved it and looking forward to adding to shrimp or chicken in the future.

Fabulous! I used 5 ounces parmesan cheese and 3 ounces romano, because that is what I had on hand. I served this with bowtie pasta and mixed in cooked bacon and onions, cooked chicken,  1 package fresh spinach, and 3 diced roma tomatos. Two of my daughter's teenage friends showed up for dinner. They each had 3 helpings. What a hit this was!

This was really the best. I did not have any fontina cheese and the parmesan melted well when I took it off the heat. The only thing is that it did not reheat well in the microwave. The butter separated really nasty.  I will cook it again as my whole family loved it, thank you.

I normally make single servings of Alfredo of simply reduced butter, cream and parmesan. This would be great for at least a pound of fettuccine. 
As for Sabrina, who rated only 3 stars, it seems as if she used fake pram. That dry ground stuff never ~ ever melts.

we added a half jar of roasted red peppers that we pureed and added after the garlic.  Also cayenne pepper. Would have been perfect either way!

Very easy to make and make a ton of sauce.  I thought there was too much sauce for 8 servings of pasta.  I didn't have any Fontina cheese so I used mozzarella.

So, I believe that doing your own Alfredo Sauce is the best thing ever. There are MANY companies out there and just don't get the Alfredo Sauce taste. WOW! THIS WAS GREAT! After I made the sauce, I poured 1/2 cup of Mozzarella Cheese. My husband fell in love with this recipe and so did I. I'm a pasta/sauce freak and this definitely deserves a 10.

This was my first try at making Alfredo.  This recipe turned out wonderfully! I did have to substitute provolone for the fontina because I could find this cheese locally.

Very good, I sautéed some onion as well for some more flavor. Some bacon bits would be good in this as well. Didn't have all heavy cream I used 2 cups heavy cream and 2 cups whole milk increased flour to two tbls to thicken it up more.

This sauce was amazing. I am not a great cook, but followed the steps and it turned out wonderful.  Makes a lot of sauce so I would suggest cutting down the ingredients by 1/2.  -Norma E.

I thought it was good,  my kids thought it was the best alfredo I ever made. Recipe is large and takes a while to thicken. Very high in fat, usually cook with a lot less butter and cream.  But very good recipe.

This would have been fabulous for the exception that after ten minutes of thickening the cream/milk, then adding the cheese, the sauce got very thick -- too thick for my personal liking. So next time I will add more milk/cream and hopefully it won't turn out too thick.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Definitely the best alfredo sauce I have ever made.  My sauces always end up separated (butter, cream) or grainy from the cheese.

All I have to say is that I haven't bought jar alfredo sauce (hated that stuff!) in two years! I do however add about a tsp of parsley (fresh or dried). Delicious! Thank you for such a great recipe!

Loved this recipe ~ So comforting, so filling. I halved this recipe and it was plenty for 3/4 of a lb of pasta. I served Blackened Chicken with it. So full I couldn't move a muscle afterward. Five Stars!

I made this last night & it was a hit.  I made 1/2 a batch and it was plenty for my family of 5.  Super easy but does take a little time.

This was perfect! The only thing I did differently was add 6 oz. of cheese instead of 8, but I doubt that really makes a difference as far as taste. I made it for my boyfriend who is a fan of alfredo sauce and he absolutely loved it and so do I!

This is my one of my favorite special occasion dishes. I love fettucine alfredo and none of the restaurants I have been to get it right. This sauce is so darn good! I usually add a little extra garlic to my liking. I also recommend trying this with smoked fontina cheese if you can find it.I have probably made this recipe about 5 times now.

Made this yesterday for a dinner and got rave reviews. Would love to try adding some shrimp and mushrooms to this for a nice change up. Thanks for the recipe!

This is really good and simple to make! I cut the recipe to 2 servings and used it as the sauce for Chicken Alfredo pizza and it turned out great.
