I love mushrooms and I loved this gravy.  Warning though....I used salted butter - salted the mushrooms, as instructed and did not use low sodium beef broth.  By the time the gravy had reduced it was a little salty for us.  My fault entirely but just a heads up to others who will be making this.  Delicious - Thanks Chef John.

Not a bad start, but much better if you add some drippings from the meat you serve this with - in my case it was Chef John's Classic Meatloaf.  I also added a glug of red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon) and some minced shallots.  I did use the optional fresh thyme and it was a nice addition. I'd recommend NO salt - there is quite enough in the beef stock.

This was the first time that I made gravy (without my mom looking over my shoulder guiding me).  Thank you Chef John for your expertise.  I followed this recipe closely and my gravy is delicious!  Although my parents passed away and did not leave behind any recipes, I feel encouraged to get in the kitchen and make some great food.  I don't want to eat fast food anymore.  Thanks allrecipes.com!!!!!!

Vegetarians listen up!  I made this with vegetable broth.  No matter, it was super.  My vegetarian wife and I (the meat eater) loved it on mashed potatoes! If you want thicker gravy, use less broth.

Delicious and relatively easy. Yielded more than we needed for meal and leftovers, so we froze the remainder for another time. Yum! Perfect with meatloaf.

This was delicious!   Made as written, except I had to use dried thyme.  My only complaint is that I only had enough to make a half batch.  Seriously good stuff!  Served over basic meatloaf and mashed potatoes.

I have made Chef John's amazing and versatile Mushroom Gravy many times. Than I had to make it my own. I use a combination of mushrooms. Add garlic & onions to the MR sauté. Add 1 tablespoon Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar and add 2 T sherry, marsala, brandy, or red wine. Sub non-fat plain Gk yogurt or Chef John's Creme Fraiche for the heavy cream. Brown the meatloaf before spooning the gravy over it. Serve with mashed or baked potatoes, polenta, risotto, egg noodles. I  have used my favorite meatloaf recipe and made it into meatballs which I braised in Chef John's MR Gravy recipe. I have used it in lasagna. I have even used it as base sauce after reducing down on pizza; pairs particularly well with goat cheese (other cheeses, as well). It is wonderful over roast beef as well. It makes (homemade) seitan taste incredible!

I made this a few times, just to be sure. Then made it for a wedding of 65 guest! I was given many excellent reviews. I really didn't know how important cooking out the moisture was until this video, no water no lumps, or at least that's how it played out. Be sure to cook the mushrooms all the way down, the flavor is great. I did add some good red wine for depth and color, but other than that it's a perfect Chef John recipe...again. OH, I did reheat it for the wedding and it came back to the correct thickness, so it can be made ahead.

This was my first Chef John recipe and I must say that it was average at best. Extremely salty, bland, and required a lot of tweaking.

Very good gravy, no lumps and great flavor. I made as written but with no added salt as my beef broth had plenty. I imagine this would taste more flavorful with added meat drippings but it's a MUSHROOM gravy, how in the world anyone can fault the recipe that is beyond me. I will make this again and it needs no changes to be 5-star quality, thanks so much for sharing.

I made this tonight to top an eye of round roast and mashed potatoes.  Very good.  I added some sherry.  Sherry and mushrooms LOVE each other. So many other reviewers said it was "missing" something.  Sherry was a good something to add.

This was great! I used 2 10 oz packages of sliced mushrooms because that is how they sell them at the store and used chicken stock instead of beef because I made turkey meatloaf. I didn't have any fresh thyme so I skipped that. We had people over for dinner when I made it and they all raved about it.  I will be making this often!

This recipe is amazingly delicious!! The only changes I made was to use vegetable stock instead of beef stock, and used 50g of flour to make it to the consistency that I liked. I served it over Chef John's mashed potatoes and my family loved it! This is going to be THE gravy from now on!

I live in a house where gravy is a staple, have never tried to make mushroom gravy. This one is so good and easy, if you consider stirring and stirrring and stirring easy, which I do. My grandmother told me that you cant make good gravy unless you stir, and stir and stir. She told me that you need to keep the pan or skillet just under burning it to make good gravy, I did that with this recipe and KUDOS to Chef John!

I wish I could give this a 5 cause I really liked it and it was so easy to make....my only thing was...it lacked some flavor. I liked the addition of the thyme, salt and pepper....but it needed more. I used 3 c of beef broth and actually increased the flour by 1tblspn. Perfect thickness and very smooth...just lacked something. I think like another reviewerr pointed out it was lacking pan drippings from a roast which we all know is loaded with flavor. A great start recipe though....and served over Chef John's Perfect Mashed Pototoes. Thanks!

This was easy and turned out so well - lots of flavor and the perfect consistency.  I used vegetable stock, but otherwise made it as written.  I'll definitely make this again.

Mmmm! I made this tonight to go over some mashed red potatoes. This was dashed good. Not as thick as some gravies, but the potatoes just soaked this up. Followed to the letter and it's a keeper!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I liked how less salty it was compared to the stuff in a jar. Plus, it also used fresh mushrooms. I think the trick with gravy, must be the simmering. It really did thicken it nicely. I made 1/2 recipe and got about 1 cup of gravy, which was plenty. I kept the cooking times the same.

This is my go-to gravy recipe. I generally use chicken stock though because it's sold in bulk at Costco and I always have it on hand. I've also started using less butter than called for just out of personal preference. If you're like me and realize you need more because it smells so darn good as you're making it and people keep walking into the kitchen in awe that you can actually make gravy and it doesn't need to come from a jar ... don't just add more broth and dump in more flour or you'll end up with little dough balls in your gravy, to make the batch bigger last minute turn down the heat and slowly whisk in more flour and broth until you have the desired consistency.

It was WAY too salty as written in the recipe.

I was worried about that extra pinch of salt to help "draw out" the water from the mushrooms, which only made it worse when simmering down the broth and concentrating the flavors.

Next time, I'd use either unsalted butter and/or low-sodium beef broth.  I used it over mashed potatoes and buttermilk meatloaf, which paired perfectly with the gravy.

I've made several batches of this gravy and have tried low sodium stock, broth, store brand stock as well as a quality stock. I've salted the mushrooms, I've left the salt out of the mushrooms, used salted butter, unsalted butter - you name it I've tried it. Mostly due to making it from memory or using what I happened to have on hand at the time. The best batch I made was my first batch. The stock you use makes a big difference. I chose a high quality low sodium stock, did not salt the mushrooms and used salted butter which resulted in a very flavorful perfectly seasoned gravy. I have tried both sliced as well as roughly chopped mushrooms and prefer the chopped version. The reducing definitely increases the salt content so watch the simmering process carefully. It is easy to get busy in the kitchen and forget about your simmering gravy which can make or break this recipe. The fresh thyme was a nice touch. Yum!

This recipe is great. I served it with Chef John's Classic meatloaf and it is a really good gravy recipe considering there isn't any meat drippings. I will be making this again. Thank you Chef John. FYI - I used unsalted butter and low sodium beef broth and it wasn't too salty. I did not use the beef stock but either would work.  I do have a question, why 30 mins to cook the gravy, and why so long for the liquid to evaporate from the mushrooms? I had my gravy cooked within  10 mins but let it cook a little longer.

I used mushroom broth instead of beef stock, and instead of butter I used meat drippings, added some pureed garlic and a pinch of pepper.....much tastier!

Interested in a mushroom gravy sauce for masked potatoes, along side a filet, I came across this recipe. Being a little simple, I had to give it a try. I cut the mushrooms in cubes, rather than slices, to give it a meatier feel. Too compensate for the amount of slat I used a mixture of low sodium chicken stock and water, which I loved. Overall, very easy and I enjoyed.

Made a half batch using chicken stock instead and this was, by far, the best gravy I ever tasted. Next time I would use a few more mushrooms since they shrink so much. A+

I'm sure the recipe as stated is great, but I did a few extras, since I like a lot of vegetables in my food.  I used a vegetarian stock, sauted garlic, onion, hot peppers and bell peppers with the mushrooms.  I also added chardonay at the end.  I would do without the bell peppers if I don't happen to have them, but I think the garlic and onions is a must.  This recipe is so easy too.  I just estimated everything, without using any measuring cups/spoons, and it still came out smooth, thick and delicious.

Update: I just watched the video for the first time. I'm happy he explained what Cremini mushrooms are (I didn't know before). He explained that the only difference between that and the white mushrooms are that the Cremini's are grown in the sun and not worth getting because they're more expensive. The Cremini's sound more healthy to me (more vitamin D, which the one's grown in the dark probably don't have at all).

Excellent gravy, however I also tried it using the juices in the crock pot after cooking all day. I cut up my roast into 1 1/2 in cubes, trimming off most of fat leaving a little for taste and cooked all day on medium. I took 2 cups of juices out and whisked in 1 cup of flour and returned mix to the crock pot adding and stirring slowly so not to shred the meat and it thickened up nicely and kids loved it!

This sauce was excellent!!  I did add some dried sage and about a tsp. of soya sauce, used vegetable broth and at the end added 2 tbsp. heavy cream and I used cornstarch to thicken it.  Thanx Chef John ;-)

I'm only giving this 4 stars because my gravy never thickened. But that's probably my fault because I didn't pay attention to the "as needed" suggestion. But the gravy tasted good. I used 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of pepper and 1/4 tsp of dried thyme (didn't have fresh). My hubby even liked it, and he's not a big fan of mushrooms. Next time I will use a little more flour.

I was making a complete vegetarian version so used vegetable stock which made this a bit less savory than I wanted.  I just kept doctoring it up with onion powder and other spices until it tasted right.  Then I froze it as one of my "make aheads" for Thanksgiving dinner.  I will definitely use this recipe going forward... it's worth the time investment for a wonderful gravy and freezes really well.

Very very good.  Since I am not a mushroom lover, it had too many mushrooms for me.  I will definitely make again and only use 1/2 the amount of  mushrooms and cut them in smaller pieces.

Oh wow!! This was the best gravy I have ever had!! I never saw anyone make good gravy and this was my first try. It came out thick and delicious. 
The only difference is that it took more than an hour for it to thicken and it was so delicious that it was barely enough for six people. Next time I’m doubling it!!

While this recipe is good, I am giving it 4 stars because it’s not great.  What I did to add to the flavor profile was add some Cabernet to the gravy and took out some beef stock to keep the liquid amount consistent. This is a basic recipe and pretty much a suggestion on how much salt, pepper & thyme to add. I did use fresh mushrooms and sliced them up myself for a better taste than canned mushrooms. With the additions, it was terrific!  I even licked my plate clean (once everyone was out of eyesight) and the porterhouse steak was gone!

This was just okay for me. Used it to go along with some homemade precooked meatballs I pulled from the freezer. I cooked my mushrooms on high heat with dried thyme before adding the butter to get them to brown. I kept tasting it thinking it was missing flavor... I was using lemon in another dish.. And decided to squeeze the juice of almost half a lemon over this at the end of cooking and a healthy amount of fresh cracked black pepper.. That made this come to another level and make it good.

Always love Chef John's recipes!  Followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfectly. I browned some meatballs first separately and then added them to the gravy for the last 10 or 15 minutes to cook them through. Served with Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes and steamed broccoli. They whole family cleaned their plates, including the picky 5 and 7 yr olds!

I have made this a few times now and this time I changed it up a bit. This gravy is spectacular the way it is but I had pork that I wanted to cook. My mom used to use cream of mushroom soup and take pork chops and fry them then cover them with the soup and simmer til they were tender. Well I don't like using the soup because of the sodium and preservatives. So I decided to cut my pork roast into chops, season with salt and pepper and pan fry with some olive oil and butter. In another pan I decided to make this gravy. I sauteed some onion til clear, added my mushrooms and a couple of cloves of minced garlic. Waited till the liquid evaporated and followed the directions for the gravy. When my pork "chops" were browned, I cut them up in smaller pieces and added them to my gravy. I also added some fresh thyme and a couple of fresh sage leaves chopped. I simmered the pork in the mushroom gravy till it was super tender. I also added a few glugs (industry term) of white wine to the gravy. While all that was happening I boiled up some egg noodles. We spooned the pork mixture over the noodles and magic happened, it was completely silent. Everyone loved the dinner, Thanks Chef John for a perfect recipe to also make it my own.

I tried this recipe last night and it was nothing less that exceptional!! I doubled the mushrooms using regular & cremini. I didn't have thyme on hand, I used the beef stock and followed the recipe other than that.It was such a great hit with the family that I will double the recipe next time.

made this tonight with french onion crusted pork chops, mashed, and corn. It was amazing. My first time making gravy from scratch, it was delicious!!! I just kind of ended up eyeballing everything. Used a whole container of fresh mushrooms cooked in butter added flour to coat then added one can (a little over 2 cups of beef broth) I seasoned with a little salt and pepper. Also added some (about a tablespoon) balsamic glaze for a little something extra. I also added a little more flour at the end (about a 1/4 cup) to thicken it a little more. I was getting impatient to eat!! From start to finish Id say it only took about 20 mins. But it still tasted amazing!

Made this last night for stuffed chicken breasts and loved it! I used low salt chicken broth, added the drippings from the roasted chicken breasts, portabella mushrooms, and added touch of sherry. It made the entire meal restaurant quality and paired well with both the chicken and mashed potatoes. I butterflied the breasts, seasoned, stuffed with cream cheese & chopped spinach, then wrapped with 4 slices of bacon. I first seared in a cast iron skillet and then finished in the oven. My guest said it was amazing and t she felt it was better than the $38 dinner she ordered the last time we went out. It deffinately was the best meal I have made and I should have taken her $$ : )

I agree with all the wine comments, otherwise a good basic mushroom gravy recipe.

I think you changed my husband's life for the better good. . . 
Something as simple as a gravy (which I don't care for) and mushrooms (again, moi, ick), made my grandmother's birthday meatloaf for my husband and in-laws fantastic. 
Thanks Chef John! There's not a recipe you've made that I haven't loved. Well, I skipped the gravy boat here, but I get a 'get out of jail card' on this one.

Certainly easy, but even after 30 minutes just not as thick as we like our gravy, I had to thicken it with a bit of cornstarch, since I used all my broth, I went ahead and mixed the starch in with some Sherry wine, then it thickened up nicely. I used my own homemade stock so it had a nice flavor, and I liked the wine addition. Great over mashed potatoes.

This was a delicious recipe that my family enjoyed. It was very easy to prepare and I like that it can be made with ingredients that a typical household would always have on hand. Very inexpensive, and it could be customized if one should wish. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

This is a great recipe. The comments about being too salty are spot on. I think the suggestion of adding red wine is good. I used this for hot hamburger sandwiches with mash potatoes and it was a big hit!

We made this with the High Temprature Eye-of-Round Roast and it was the perfect compliment. We cut the cooking time in half though. I didn't realize how long this took to cook.  Regardless, it turned out very good.

Excellent.  I needed to use up some mushrooms and had to use what I had on hand.  I used one can of beef consumme, a half can of water and two cups of vegetable broth.  It came out great!

I made this gravy with vegetable stock and lots of ground pepper and served it with mashed potatoes. This is rich, full of flavor, and better than any canned gravy.

I made this for Christmas dinner, using "Better Than Boullion" beef base (with water)as the beef stock. The gravy was a huge hit - recieved many compliments. Even my husband, who doesn't like mushrooms and picked them all out, loved the gravy. I simmered mine almost an hour to get the consistency I prefer.

This is a very easy recipe.  You really can use any kind of stock.  I was making turkey, so used chicken stock and it came out wonderfully.  Smooth and tasty.  I will definitely use again.  Thanks!

This was so good. I made it with low sodium veg broth.  The only time I've made homemade gravy is at Thanksgiving.  This Thanksgiving I made lentil loaf, and made this gravy to go on top. OMGosh so good.

50 plus minutes to make gravy? You  are supposed to make gravy while the meat is resting. Bland and average.

Years ago, a very talented home cook shared with me the secret of making a Roux: "First, you make the roux." Following this recipe exactly, my gravy turned out with a pronounced dry flour taste. I have plenty of gravy left over, so I'm going to try to "fix" whats left

Just a note about the mushrooms...  the Button Mushroom and the Cremini Mushroom are both Agaricus bisporus.  The White Button is the young (yes, grown in the dark) mushroom.  The Cremini is the older (usuall wild) mushroom and is also know as the Baby Bella. Yep, the mature Agaricus bisporus is indeed the Portabella.  There is a different, but familiar flavor to each kind.  So Cremini Mushrooms do not taste exactly like Button Mushrooms, but very similar.  Worth the cost?  Meh, depends on the dish.  So anyway, this is a basic mushroom gravy and is pretty good, although, I made it with chicken stock so it wasn't overwhelmed with the beer flavor.  Thumbs up!

My first attempt at any type of gravy. There’s a couple of things I’m wondering about. First when I added the flour and stirred it all attached to the mushrooms and made a big glob. I stirred it so not to burn it. But chickened out and added the cup of stock after about 4 maybe 5 minutes. It all  seemed to work fine. Not sure if it affected it or not. I loved the gravy.

I sautéed the mushrooms with butter and a little salt. Through it in the beef stock and added flour and other ingredients careful to not add anymore salt to the gravy. It came out perfect. I really love this website. Five stars!!!!

This came out even better than expected. I added a little au jus from a roast I was making when I added the broth just to match the flavor gravy to the roast, and it was excellent.

I've made this several times with low sodium chicken broth and it is Excellent. I will be making it for Thanksgiving. The best part is you can make it in advance and heat on the stovetop rather than panicking at the last minute with pan dripping gravy. Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!

Great gravy! It was perfect for meatloaf and whipped potatoes. Works as is but I had a few tweaks. 
- Use 50% reduced-sodium stock and unsalted butter, you can always add salt at the end but you can't take it out
- Add Marsala (or another red cooking type) wine, adds flair

Amazing! I made it as per chef’s instructions using his video as reference and I nailed it. I have a VERY happy husband too who said it was worth waiting for! I used a low sodium beef stock. For those complaining it is too salty, just reduce the salt to your liking. The only thing that was time consuming was how long it took to thicken - yes, longer than most gravies, but this really pulls out the mushroom, thyme and pepper flavours! This would also make a lovely peppercorn gravy! Delish! I’ll definitely make this again! *Note - if you’re in a hurry and must speed up thickening, use 1tbs of corn starch with a bit of cold water. Mix, and pour into the gravy. Thickens in no time and does not change the flavour!

This is the perfect mushroom gravy. The only addition I made was to add a splash of Sherry with about 10 minutes left in the reduction.

I used unsalted butter, mushroom broth, powdered garlic powder, onion powder, and thyme powder (instead of fresh).  So rich and delicious.  This is our first year not eating meat (we're still eating eggs and dairy) and I am actually looking forward to Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow!

Never buy a to-go mushroom burger again as long as this is around. Don't forget the roast  beef and. potatoes.

OMG folks, this sauce was really good. Poured it over our meatloaf and baked potato. Watch the video. Have patience. I actually started making this 47 mins prior to when my meatloaf would be done. I needed every bit of it. It takes 20 mins to "sweat" the water out if them, then the simmering afterwards. Great mushroom gravy.

It’s true... that thing they say... ‘the simplest things are the most beautiful’.  And in this case, DELICIOUS!  I have been making gravy for years and apparently my method was a bit off.  Method matters!  Thank you (again) for the education Chef John!

This is excellent and easy! The taste is so much better than using canned mushroom soup. I used unsalted beef broth but salted butter and maybe a pinch of pepper.  I used this in place of canned soup in a recipe for baked pork chops (these were really thick). After baking, I then removed the juices and again thickened it somewhat and poured it over the chops. Husband loved it! He walked up to the pot and kept pouring extra on his and then ensured that any leftover was saved for himself. This recipe is perfect!  I can't wait to try this again when our morel mushrooms are ready to pick again.

Thanks so much for this recipe!  I  make it almost every time I have mushrooms in the fridge (weekly).  I add a dash of Worcestershire, coconut aminos and Mrs. Dash.  I always use sprouted grain flour or unbleached whole wheat to stay away from bleached flour.  My son does not eat the mushrooms so I scoop around them to give him mushroomless gravy.  Why should mom and dad have to suffer for a little one that does not eat mushrooms?  It's so good and so comforting!

Wonderful!  It's easy to make although it will take you an hour or so to plate.  It's the kind of recipe that you can read and make without referring back to the recipe.  I used 50% less sodium and was wondering if you could add a dash of kitchen bouquet for a darker, more appealing look without adding too much sodium?

I’m not the best cook ever, but I was confused about the proportions of this. My gravy never thickened with 1/4 cup of flour so I added more. Also it took way longer than any gravy should take.

Oh Chef John,
When I frequented Allrecipes weekly I haunted you because I had an idea that whatever delectable morsel I was looking for you would probably have a delicious version of it. And then a couple of years ago I made the move from Windows to Mac, and Android to iPhone. I’ve never been happier because my devices are 100% problem free!!! Never an issue anymore. So what do I do when searching for recipes? I Google Baked Beans by Chef John, Chocolate Almond Cake by Chef John. And that’s how I got this recipe which I’ve not had a chance to try yet. I was looking for beef mushroom gravy and I read beef isn’t all you’ve got up your sleeve — as though you’d READ MY MIND! I can’t wait! Thank you Chef John because I know it’all be outstanding!

Absolutely delicious!  Like others I used this as a base. I added beef roast drippings and I used half as much mushrooms because I just had a small container.  I am happy with this change as the gravy was great and balanced.  For my taste I liked it more of a gravy with mushrooms for potatoes.

We loved it!  We didn't have quite enough mushrooms, but the gravy turned out amazingly anyway.  We used vegan stock.

I made dinner for my family and included this little gem. My wife said we are never buying packet gravy again. I would say it was a great addition. Tastes much better than your store bought and/or packet based gravies. Everyone seemed to love it.

Too salty?
Most Professional recipes figure most home cooks use Unsalted butter ( well, maybe salted on toast) - ergo- the "salt to taste"  comment.

For two, we" 1/4 'd" the recipe and it was wonderful!


Thanks!

Aloha, Bigislandtom.

This was FABULOUS! I didn't need that large amount (it's only 2 of us) so I halved all the ingredients. WONDERFUL! My husband loved it so much he drank all of the left over gravy! Super easy to make, too! This one is a keeper! Thanks, Chef John!

This was very easy.  I made some changes. Or additions because I am on a very low salt diet and I need some extra seasoning but the method is the key here and it worked like a charm.  I added onion in with the mushrooms and when ready made the roux as directed.  After adding the stock, as the gravy began to thicken, I added some Salt Free Spicy Herb Blend (less seeds) by Christina (from this site) and a bit of garlic powder.  Excellent with pork.  Used what was left over from gravy and pork with roasted veg in a pork pie.

I followed the recipe, but didn't cook flour long enough.  Big mistake.   My gravy tasted undone.  In the future, I'll just use Lipton Onion Soup Mix to make gravy.  Fool-proof.

I did not make any changes to the recipe. It turned out absolutely fantastic. Best mushroom gravy my family had ever had. Don't change a thing, it's amazing as is. Chef John, I seriously hope you are employed with Allrecipes as a chef, because there's obviously something special about you, and you deserve a big salary. I love your recipes and you are an amazing cook with maybe a superhuman cooking sense. Pretty sure you could tell us how to cook a rubber hose, and it would turn out tender and delicious lol.  If you are ever in Oregon, I'd love to have you over. I'd cook your recipes for you hehe. Seriously though, thank you. You are a heck of a cook.

This was fabulous and I used it on my schnitzel.  The first time I made it I used gravy from the packet and I really hate “packets” so it was a proud moment to follow this great recipe with awesome, packet-free results.

I chopped the mushrooms very finely since I have 2 children that don't like the mouth-feel of mushrooms but like the flavour.  I ended up caramelising the mushrooms for about 10 minutes in the butter before adding the flour.  Since I used an OXO for the broth, the gravy was salty and I added a small splash of Chianti and two "splooges" of balsamic vinegar.  Balanced out the salt nicely and made for a super flavourful gravy,  and it was just perfect with garlic mashed potatoes and Chef John's Classic Meatloaf!!

For something with just a few simple ingredients, this gravy tastes amazing!   I was truly surprised at the depth of flavor.  Made some hamburgers and mashed potatoes and poured the gravy over it all.  Total comfort food.

Very good flavor.  Deglazed roast pan with beef broth.  Used unsalted butter, and low sodium broth.  Salted the mushrooms but saved most of  seasoning for reduction.

I'm a huge mushroom lover so this was right up my ally.  I actually made SOOOO much more than I needed for our dinner, but I put the leftovers in the fridge and will reheat and use on other meals throughout the week.  This was just... perfect.

Excellent recipe chef John!!  My family absolutely loved it. I did make some minor modifications by using low-sodium beef stock and added one finely minced shallot that I sautéed with the mushrooms. This gravy has an excellent flavor and consistency due to leveraging a traditional roux and mushrooms. I served this over mashed potatoes along side Chef John’s wonderful traditional meatloaf.

Delicious!! Used vegetable broth since I am a vegetarian. I was afraid it was going to bland with just salt and pepper as seasonings (thyme optional). It wasn't....it was delish!!! Thank you, Chef John!!! My new mushroom gravy recipe. Family approved! ;-)

Made as written using unsalted butter and reduced sodium beef broth along with approximately 1/2 tsp of dried thyme. About halfway through simmering I wasn't sure it was going to thicken up enough for me, but at the end of the 30 minutes it was perfect! This is a really nice gravy that will enhance any beef meal without overpowering it. I will be making it again and again. Thanks Chef John

Quite tasty.  I used chanterelle mushrooms, which worked nicely.

I use this often with smothered pork chops in place of cream of mushroom soup (I am sensitive to MSG and cannot use premade soups) and we absolutely love this recipe. I use chicken stock (better than bouillon brand, does not contain MSG) with pork dishes.

This is a good base recipe for mushroom gravy. I added garlic and sliced onions and it was really good. I think I’ll add some white wine next time. I wanted “sh*t on a shingle” so I also added ground beef and it was really good. Yes, I know I changed a lot of the recipe but the core ingredients are there and they worked well.

I've made it as written, which is delicious! I've also tweaked the recipe when I didn't have mushrooms or beef stock:

Roux as is. 
900mL beef  broth
After it simmered for about 15 mins, added about 1/4 cup of Cab Sauv
Grabbed a packet of No Name onion soup mix, strained out the bits and put the powder into the gravy. Simmered for about 1/2 hr longer, whisked a LOT. 
Was salty, but my family went bananas for it. Served it with Bangers and Mash.

I love to get mushroom gravy at restaurants.  But every time I get store bought mushroom gravy it was no good.

I made it exactly as described, no substitutions. 

Wow! It was the absolute best mushroom gravy I had in my life.  I recommend this recipe to everyone.

This recipe is a good base but I added a couple of things to bring the flavor I was looking for.  First, I barely salted the mushrooms.  I added one cube of beef bouillon, 2 T of Worcestershire and 1 T of brandy.  I served it with meatloaf and mashed cauliflower.   Enjoy!

*** Unless the recipe calls specifically for salted butter, use unsalted butter. ***

I always use unsalted butter. Using salted butter can over-salt any recipe. You can always add more salt, but you cannot take it away.

I used vegetable stock and the result rivals the mushroom gravy that I buy from Whole Foods at Thanksgiving. It is so, so good and worth the extra effort of making it at home!

Absolutely delicious! I was put off at first by the cook time, but it was absolutely worth it! The instructions are easy to follow and this makes a lot of gravy. This is something I would be willing to make all the time!

I used unsalted butter and only added salt to the mushrooms. As others have mentioned, the beef stock was salty enough when it reduced and this was an excellent, very simple to make gravy. The thyme was also a delicious add! It is definitely not optional. Thank you, Chef John!

My husband and I loved this recipe. We had veal cutlets and wanted something like jaegerschnitzel...I used to use onion soup mix to make gravy but have to watch the salt. I used low sodium beef broth and added pepper and just a pinch of salt at the end. Spooned onto mashed potatoes and the veal and really enjoyed it!

I made this once with thyme (with beef) and once without (with chicken bouillon, chicken drippings) and both times were just amazing. I didn't change a thing. I wouldn't change a thing. My family gobbled up dinner - they were putting this gravy on the string beans it was so good! I love that Chef John actually tells you to cook something for twenty minutes, fifteen minutes, etc. instead of just - until brown or whatever. You just know you need to be patient for the good stuff!

I used plain button mushrooms and finely chopped shallots, and did not get any liquid, so this was faster than I thought.  Very good gravy.  Will make this again.

This was a wonderful gravy, the only change I made was add a bit of garlic powder and I used mushroom stock since I had some. I didn't add the thyme because I forgot too. I put it on mashed potatoes and meatloaf. Yumm.

I just made and discarded two mushroom gravy recipes.  Both called for a lot more ingredients and ended up being a waste of time.  I decided to make this (3rd times a charm, right?) and am pleased with the results.   I sautéed onion & garlic, then processed that with a little of the broth so the gravy would be smooth.   Then cooked down the mushrooms and added rest of broth.   Added no salt, didn't need it.  Added some fresh parsley.   Tomorrow when the beef tenderloin comes out of the oven, I will add those drippings to this gravy.   This is a basic recipe that is easy and will now be added to my recipe box.

I made this gravy for Thanksgiving and used mushroom broth since we have a couple vegetarians in my family.  Added a little cornstarch/milk to thicken since it wasn't reducing quick enough but that was the only change. Be sure to use fresh thyme if you can.....it really enhances the flavor of this delicious sauce. Will definitely make again!

This is my first time making gravy.  I made this tonight with  meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  It was a lot easier then I thought it would be.  No more jar gravy for me!!!!  This will be my mushroom gravy recipe  from now on.

This is a terrific recipe. I used low sodium broth and added a touch of red wine. This a for sure go to gravy for pork tenderloin and was also a great addition to the mushroom risotto.

I made this gravy exactly as directed, no changes save to halve the recipe because I was short on beef broth, and it came out great. Exactly what I was looking for, I'll make it again with meatloaf.

I used chicken stock and added fresh herbs and some garlic. This is a great base recipe to make your own added flavors. Served over my chicken and it took the chicken to a whole other level.

Great, basic, flexible (variety in mushrooms. stock....) caution: do not salt until taste test in last 3 minutes or so. C. John seems to have a "pinch of cayenne" in many of his dishes and I think it "brightens" the gravy some also.

A simple gravy over London broil. It was very good. I deviated from the recipe just a bit. For 2 servings. Using 1 cup broth, 1 can mushrooms, 1 tbs butter and 1 tbs flour and salt.  I will make this again!

Another great Chef John recipe! I omitted the salt and used salted butter.  I did have to add about a tablespoon of flour to thicken the gravy a little more at the end of the cooking time. The gravy was outstanding over steak and steamed veggies! I will definitely make it again.

I've made this a couple times and it's very good.  I like to spray a pan with cooking spray and brown pork stew meat with garlic.  I remove the meat from the pan and follow the recipe.  Add the meat in the last 10 min of cooking the gravy.  Serve over noodles or mashed potatoes.  Great meal!

This was a good start. It was defiantly missing something. Tastes better after I added a few splashes of worshersirshire sauce.

Excellent. I increased the recipe by 50% to use as a sauce over fehttuchini and pork chops. I also added half of a diced yellow onion and sautéed first to caramelize a bit. Since I still had a lot of water from the mushrooms after cooking for the time mentioned, I added less stock to compensate. Thank you Chef John!

Fantastic. I was in a pinch for mushrooms, so used what I had, a giant Portobello! It was for tofurkey and mashed potatoes, so I used veggie broth, added a small amount  of minced onion, and fresh garlic through a press. Be warned, it cooks for a long time to reduce it to a gravy. At the end I used an immersion blender while it was still on the stove. My sweetie proclaimed that it was by far the best gravy she's had in her life! I'll be making this again!

I love this recipe so much. I made it years ago when I realized I needed a gravy for Christmas, though I’ve never been a gravy eater. Now, it is heartily requested by family even when I’m not hosting. It also freezes well, so I just froze a batch to serve at Christmas. I go pretty heavy with fresh thyme. The end effect is a dish my picky two year old eats with gusto.

Happy Hubby once again thank you Chef John!
Served it as is per the recipe.  
I did set some aside to play with, one sample I added sour cream, one I added sour cream and a spot of Dijon mustard, last sample I added some red wine.  Hubby liked the original version the best.

Followed the recipe exactly as is except I used GF flour, and it was absolutely delicious. Simple, quick, and flavorful. I served over mashed potatoes and loved it, but I'll definitely be adding it to the menu for pork chops, roasts, loins, and any other meat as well because it's so good. My husband hates mushrooms and he thought it was great (a first for him)! He even told me we should make it in a bigger batch and freeze next time. Huge win if I can get my husband on board with a mushroom dish of any kind!

I had sautéed some mushrooms and onions to go with the pork chops I just fried and decided to make gravy with them instead with this recipe. Best decision I made. Did not need to add extra salt because I already salted the mushrooms and onions. Yummy!

Thank you for sharing this recipe. It turned wonderful.  The second time I made it I added a half cup of red wine during the last 10 minutes of cooking and it was amazing.

It is a nice gravy. No lumps and easy to make but a bit bland for my taste. I like a lot of punch so I added an extra beef stock cube and also reduced 1/2 cup red wine until around 3/4 was gone and added to the gravy.

I just made this gravy to go over a pork tenderloin.  I am not even really a gravy person - but this gravy was soooooo good!  I was sorry that I didn't make a huge pot of it!  My husband loved it!  I used white mushrooms and baby portabellas - wow - what a rich flavor!

I used baby portobello mushrooms (that's what I had on hand)with this recipe.  It was fabulous and so easy.  My husband has a discerning pallet and he loved this recipe.  I served it on minute steaks and oven roasted new potatoes.  This is a very versatile recipe that allows the delicious mushroom flavor to shine.  This could be a meatloaf topper, as well.  Thank you!

The best gravy.... Ever!!!! Simply delicious. We've had it on steak, meatloaf, roast beef, & mashed potatoes. Didn't have fresh thyme- so used dried herbs de Provence. Also- used 3-4 tsp dissolved in 2 cups warm water better than beef bouillon rather than beef stock- cuts down on the amount of liquid you need to reduce. Chef john is amazing!

I did add about a tablespoon of a Cabernet which added a nice depth to the flavor. Delicious with or without that. I second what others have said about watching the salt.

Thought this was delicious. I used unsalted beef broth(Swanson)  and it was salty enough for us. I thought it needed a little more flour because it was more like a sauce than a gravy, but the mushroom flavor was great.I don't usually rate recipes but this one would be good on many different meat recipes so I think it is a keeper.

I didn't follow this exactly per the instructions. I added only one can of 14 ounce beef stock and it came out divine! I'm using it for mushroom swiss burgers! Thank you Chef John!!! This will be a constant in our home! I can't quit *sampling* it...lol

This was the first time I have made gravy from scratch.  Very easy and nice mushroom flavour - but TOO SALTY!  Definitely no need to add salt to the mushrooms as recipe suggests. Will make again with these amendments :)

This recipe was fantastic.  I omitted using additional salt, though I did use salted butter.  I also had beef stock paste (1 tspn per 8oz of water), and only used 2 tspns of it so it wouldn't be as salty.  I probably should have only used 3 cups of water instead of 4, as it was more liquidy than I wanted, but I had already added all of the water, and ended up adding some extra flour to thicken it.  Absolutely delicious.  Used on chicken and baked fries.  Will definitely make again!!  Thanks!

I made this for brunch with biscuits.  I used chicken broth - it was delicious!  I did add chardonnay to enhance the flavors.  Although I didn't have fresh thyme I used dried thyme and still loved the thyme in there.  I made this for a crowd and have leftovers.  I cannot wait to use this in a baked chicken and rice dish!

This was good, but thin and a little salty. I expected both of those from the video and the other reviews. I halved the mushrooms and felt there were still plenty. I would use low sodium stock/broth next time as others recommended and probably still halve the mushrooms for our taste. I would also add extra thickener since we prefer a thicker gravy than this. We thought this went well with meatloaf and mashed potatoes and was a simple preparation.

It was delicious, especially for having such simple ingredients. I made the recipe mostly as stated. I used Imagine Low Sodium Vegetable Broth and pinch of dried thyme. When I first combined the ingredients, I was really worried it would turn out horribly due to widely varying flavors. After simmering for several minutes, the flavors really started coming together though. I ended up having to add quite a bit of salt, which I expected; I usually have to add extra salt for the broth I used. I also chopped the mushrooms instead of sliced them. It took a little more time, but I really enjoy having many small bits of mushrooms rather than a few larger pieces. Even though the broth had an orange color, the gravy came out the usual grayish color of mushroom gravy after simmering, which was a relief. (I was worried it would look unnatural.) I will definitely keep and use this recipe. It probably made about 3 and a half cups of gravy. If anybody has used the vegetarian mushroom gravy recipe that calls for tablespoons of soy sauce, I would give up that recipe and use this. This can easily be made vegan as well.
