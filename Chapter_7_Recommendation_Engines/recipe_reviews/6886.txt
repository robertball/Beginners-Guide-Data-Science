I also changed a few things and my family loved them.  I used almost twice the zucchini, used a whole egg instead of egg whites, and used vanilla soy milk instead of fat free milk.  I added chopped walnuts, which really helped the texture of the muffin.  A sprinkle of oats on top before baking made them pretttier to look at, too.

This is the exact same recipe as "Apple Muffins," also found on this site, except these have zucchini instead of apples.  However, the recipe has the same problems.  I would recommend using a whole egg instead of two egg whites, and substituting 1/2 c. white sugar for the 1/4 c. honey.  The increase in fat/calories is minimal, and worth it for the better taste.

The first batch I made was rather bland, but good as a dinner bread.  The next batch was better.  I doubled the amount of honey and substituted applesauce for the oil.  Also good with walnuts!

I made changes to the recipe,I followed some of the advice from the others. I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg,used 1/4 cup of cinnamon applesauce and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also used 11/2 cups of zucchini and added a brown sugar and cinnamon topping wich was 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon mixed together and sprinkled on the top of each muffin before baking. They turned out very good.

I used some of the modifications that others mentioned, plus a few of my own and these turned out delicious (and only 2 points for those of you WW out there). I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the honey, 2% milk, a whole egg instead of whites and I also added some dried cranberries to the mix as well as some apple cinnamon instant oatmeal on the top for a little added crunch. Oh, and besides the cinnamon, I also put in a dash of ground cloves and a dash of ground nutmeg. They were not "blah" at all as other people described. The extra additions really perked these healthy muffins up!

These were sooo good!! The only thing I did to change the recipe was add another cup of grated zucchini, which made them really moist! I was going to add cranberries but forgot, so I sprinkled some on top with some walnuts (I didn't have enough to put in batter) and oats. Delicious and healthy! Oh, I also changed the oil for applesauce.

These muffins were ok...nothing spectacular though.  I did change quite a few things as follows: I substituted 1 cup of white flour for 1 cup of whole wheat, I added about 1 tsp fresh nutmeg, I used 1% milk instead of non-fat, I used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites, instead of the vegetable oil, I used 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  As well, instead of using honey, I used splenda and increased it to 1/2 cup and also increased the zucchini to 1.5 cups.  Lastly, I added about 3/4 cup chopped walnuts for a little crunch.  So all in all, the muffins were a good/healthy alternative, but they still lacked something in my opinion.

Some people liked these, but I found them very blah - they need something to really pick up the flavor.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe just to get a lower fat version - just modify some others to make them lower in fat and calories.  The only way I could eat them is with a lot of honey or almond butter.  Kids would hate these.

I also found this to be not too sweet. kinda blah is a good way to put it. Not at all like zucc. bread. However, I liked them. I served them like a bread during dinner - not like a dessert bread or breakfast muffin. They are pretty low in "points" for any weight watchers out there too.(3). I think raisins may help.

I was looking for a sugar-free recipe, and this one is good. Based on other reviews, I used one whole egg, applesauce in place of the oil, and added Craisins, which were a really nice touch. I sprinkled flax seeds on top. 18 minutes in over had them nicely browned.

I liked the healthier ingredients of these, but did not realize how little sweetness they had til finished. Serve with Honey Butter, or use 1/3-1/2 c honey or brown sugar if you are wanting sweeter muffins.

Very good! I used half whole wheat flour and half regular fould, 1/2 cup sugar/splenda mix in place of the honey, and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1 Tablespoon oil (to lighten the fat even more).

I followed other users advice and used applesauce in place of oil, whole eggs instead of whites, ground cloves and nutmeg. Didnt add any sugar which I should have b/c they still turned out pretty bland! They were moist and good w/butter and honey but not just as is, if I make again it will be with some brown sugar!

I made these exactly as written.  I agree with another reviewer that said they would be best with dinner as opposed to a dessert or breakfast.  They are not very sweet at all.  However, the flavor and texture are nice and this is a great recipe for a healthier muffin.

Nice base recipe. After a few adjustments, AMAZING! I doubled the zucchini, used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites, and substituted 3 1/2 Tbs of Truvia for the honey. Very good, my two year old even loves them!

I didn't have any cinnamon so I used garam masala in an equal amount and used extra zucchini as other reviews had recommended. Used half whole wheat and half white flour too. I wish I had doubled the recipe these are so good!!! It's a great recipe to use as the base and add to or adjust to make your own. Heaven right out of the oven with a little butter-less healthy but...heaven!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made is as listed except that I added a little bit of vanilla extract. Best served with a low-fat margarine while still warm.

This muffin recipe was ok. I took others advice and added some sugar, glad I did or it would have been really bland.  The muffins are really dense.  I have definately had better.

Delicious!  I did add more cinnamon and a little bit of ginger.  I also used 1/2 cup egg substitute and replaced the honey with agave.  Trying to keep the recipe on the low glycemic side for my diabetic boyfriend.  Will definately make this one again.

Awesome.  My girl was whinning about using up an extra zucchini that was going to go bad soon.  She wanted to bake it in a muffin but only use wheat flour.  I don't know what her problem was - I used this site to search for those 2 items and exclude all other flours (all purpose, white, bread) and got THIS recipe.  We made'em and we loved'em.  I especially like how the recipe leaves itself open to changes.  We kept the egss whole because we're not concerned about that.  We added some brown sugar and splenda to make them more sweet.  When they cooked up they stuck to the paper cups pretty badly, but we'll figure that out.  Overall I say this is an excellent recipe and definitely one we're keeping around next time she wines about extra vegetables about to go bad...!

So easy and quick and versatile! I read the reviews of others and added a bit more honey, instead of oil I did applesauce, and chopped pecans. Now, the point of these are for health. I think they go great with anything, or for breakfast alone! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Pretty bland and doughy. It's very hard to make good pastries without having a decent amount of sugar. I would almost triple the amount of honey (or white sugar) and add extra spices to make it worth it. I think I will try a different recipe in the future.

I too found this recipie a little bland and a little dry.  I realy enjoy a nice moist, spiced zucchini bread.  For this recipie I substituted a spice blend(cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, orange zest, cloves and ginger) for the cinnamon and VERY liberally sprinkled the tops with cinnamon-sugar before baking.

I agree that it's not sweet enough. I made the following changes. I doubled the recipe, to use up all the zucchini I had shredded. I changed the flour ratio to white:wheat=1:1. I ran out of cinnamon, so used 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon cardomom. I ran out of honey, so I used about 1/4 a cup of honey and 1/4 cup of Hungry Jack fake maple syrup. I added 1/2 cup + a couple of tablespoons of sunflower seeds to use up a bag. I didn't have regular table salt, so I used sea salt. The texture was great, and they baked at the time stated, but it just wasn't as sweet as I would have preferred.

I thought these were really good.  I did add about 1/2 c. dried cranberries and 1/4 chopped walnuts.  These are not extremely sweet muffins, but I really love the fact that they don't have any sugar in them.  However, next time I will most likely increase the honey to 3/4 of a c., just to make them a little sweeter.  I will most definitely be making them again!!!

I wish I had read the reviews previous to making these muffins. It seems like many gave this recipe 4 stars, however had improvised the recipe in some form. The taste was dull. Generally Zucchini Bread is ate up in 24 hours in my house. However these weren't.

This is a good muffin. I like that it is more healthy, low fat and uses wheat flour. I might use a little more spice next time, but they were moist and tasty. We enjoyed this recipe

Pretty good, but I would not consider these muffins.  They tasted more like a dinner roll or bread.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and added more cinnamon and some nutmeg for more flavor.  The sweetness of a muffin is missing with the sugar omitted.  If you want a nice roll, then these are it!

I tried making adjustments according to people's recommendations and it just didn't work.  There was this bitter taste that I think was a result of the recipe calling for too much baking powder.  And they were very sticky, it took much longer than 20 minutes for them to bake through properly.  I would not even bother trying to fiddle with this one; just find a different recipe.

The muffins were a hit here.  I used pumpkin sauce/butter for the oil and used yogurt instead of milk.  They turned out wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe.

I liked these muffins very much. True that they are not an outburst of flavor.I followed the recipe using wild honey and a pinch more of cinnamon, the texture is great with a subtle taste of honey and cinnamon perfect for starting the day. I'll tried them again for sure.

I had read the other reviews before I made these, and therefore added a pinch of several spices (ginger, ground cloves, allspice, extra cinnamon) as well as about 1/4 cup of sugar substitute (i used equal) in addition to the honey that the recipe called for. i also used pureed pumpkin instead of oil because i had some extra pumpkin that i needed to use up. the muffins turned out very moist, but still were rather bland. next time i would use more spices and just a bit more sweetener.

Easy enough to make but dry and not flavourful enough for me. Could try adding dried cranberries for a little more sweetness and flavour. To be fair, my whole wheat flour is very course so that may be part of the problem. Will try again with some modifications.

I cut the recipe in half to make just 6 muffins. I doubled the cinnamon and added 1/4 t. allspice for extra flavor. Also I subst. maple flavored agave syrup for honey, plus 1 t. of liq. stevia for extra sweetness.  Changed the oil to coconut and milk to soy. Added 1/2 c. nuts and extra zucchini, about 1/4 c. more.  The muffins had wonderful texture and were sweet enough for me with the extra stevia. I think I might add raisins next time instead of nuts.

The original recipe wasn't quite what I was looking for, although it had a fabulous texture - very moist and hearty.  I decided to modify this recipe to make it more of a healthy treat for my toddler (I loved them as well!).  I added cocoa powder, dark chocolate chips, shredded carrots, oats and cranberries.  I only wish I had added a little more sugar or honey.

These muffins were ok.. they were not as sweet as I was expecting. I made some changes, I added a little more cinnamon and I made a sugar topping for the muffins. Also when I ate one they were very pastey so I put butter and honey in the middle.

I made a few changes also and they are delish!  I used 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of oats, almost double zucchini, 1 grated carrot,  1 tsp of salt,  3/4 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk,  1 egg, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, instead of oil I used 1/4 of applesauce, 1/4 cup of craisins,  and a squeeze of honey. Super moist!! Will be making every week.

I changed the size to mini muffins which made about 36 mini muffins. My family and I loved that if you needed a quick snack you could just pop them in your mouth. My daughter made them and everyone loved them. My daughter is inspired by many bakers to bake all kinds of sweet and healthy treats on your website. She loves that there is lots of different recipes.

These were very good for a family that does not like zucchini.  I changed the honey to 1/2 cup sugar as someone else advised and used 2 whole eggs.   I also added chocolate chips to trick my kids into eating them.  I will make these again.

This is now my go to basic zucchini recipe, I use this as a base for sultana/pineapple/coconut/walnut. Some slight addition of flour is needed if the additions are wet, but it is the quickest and easiest muffin mix.

I did not have any whole wheat flour so I used all-purpose flour and the muffins smelled great but no one in my family liked them and they didn't taste like anything.

My main issue with this recipe is that it just wasn't sweet enough. Thankfully I added some blueberries to give it more flavor, and I added 1 t vanilla. I think the honey should be doubled, or add 1/4 c of sugar. I used half white and half whole wheat, which helped with the texture. I also added about 2 tablespoons of melted coconut oil. I will probably try this recipe again with my tweaks and added sugar. Or leave out the sugar and add chocolate chips like a previous reviewer did; that sounds good.

These muffins were amazing.  However I did change a few things.  for starters I used 1 1/2 cup zucchini, used agave nectar instead of honey, a heaping teaspoon and a dash of cinnamon, 2% milk instead of nonfat (nonfat has a lot of filler and additives to give it flavor, so it's sometimes better for you to use full fat) and added about half a bag of milk chocolate chips. Recommend making these muffins as a breakfast side, for a snack or even dessert.

I am not a seasoned cook/baker at all! Im new to it all! This is such a simple recipe and really made me feel like I could try to bake more! I followed the recipe exactly with the following changes (i took other reviewers advice on some areas). I doubled the honey. Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Used 1 whole egg. I added golden raisans. Shredded one entire zuchini. With five minutes left in the oven I sprinkled cinnamon on top and drizzled melted caramel on top and let bake the remaining 5 minutes. Absolutely fabulous! Even my husband loved them! Ill be making this weekly as a healthy go to snack throughout the week!

I used white flour, two whole eggs instead of just whites, and I added 3/4 cup of quick cook oats and they turned out great. Nice and light, moist, and not super sweet at all. My young kids love them (and I don't mind them eating them!)

These are really doughy and dense, not a nice muffin texture at all. They are not sweet (which I liked) and bland. My kids liked them though.

I used paper baking cups which turned out to be a bad idea because they stuck to the paper.

For an all-whole-wheat, low sugar, healthy muffin, this is surprisingly good.  My kids devoured them.

I made all the changes mentioned above i.e. adding more spice, changing the honey to white sugar, using a whole egg and I even added a little wheat germ.  I used about 2 cups of shredded zucchini.  They were wonderful!! Served with a nice hard butter - yummy.  Okay, now here is the oops. I took somebody's suggestion and topped them with apple/cinnamon instant oatmeal and they now have that articifial, full of chemicals smell. If you need to add a topping, make your own.  Great recipe.

These were very "healthy" tasting, kind of flavorless wheat balls.

I liked these muffins.  I followed the original recipe then read the reviews and decided to add 1/2 cup of light brown sugar to the mix. Then added honey butter (fat free) to the baked muffin and they were delicious!

These are very plain.  I doubled the honey and added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and they are still plain.  Not bad tasting at all just not as flavorful as I would like.  I also used applesauce instead of oil and organic lactose free skim milk.  Maybe next time more spices???

I tried this recipe and thought it was great. I think the recipes online are just too sweet sometimes, so this was perfect. More "bread" than "cake" if ya know what I mean. I doubled the honey, so I used  1/2 cup instead of 1/4, used the whole eggs- not just the whites, and substituted unsweetened soy milk for regular moo. People love 'em!
