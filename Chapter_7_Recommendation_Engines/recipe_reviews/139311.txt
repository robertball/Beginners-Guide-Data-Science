I cooked these on the stove since I had a lot of other things going in the oven. A little time consuming to make but tasty in the end, I had none left over!

We really liked these shrimp ramakis.  I was making the recipe for two so I just scaled the recipe down with no problem. Very easy recipe.  I used sliced water chestnuts instead of whole.  Served on rice pilaf and roasted asparagus.  Made for a really good dinner.

I've had this timeless classic appetizer many times over many years so I already was certain I was going to like this.  My wife always makes them, but generally just with bacon and water chestnuts.  The shrimp takes these over the top.  Because I dislike teriyaki sauce I substituted a mix of soy sauce and sugar (1 T. sugar for every 1/4 c. soy sauce). Marinating these for 30 minutes at room temperature is plenty!

We have been making this for years, it's so awesome - I didn't know there was a recipe for it my momma taught me.     We actually flay the shrimp a little bit and stuff with horseradish mixture, then wrap in bacon.  The only problem is it takes time to make and gone in minutes !!  We make them for an appetizers

The calories stated seem off unless it's for entire number of servings versus each piece.  We calculate using 1/2 Oscar Meyer bacon on each shrimp, jumbo uncooked shrimpand marinade is about 80 per shrimp wrap.  Only point is it's a very easy, filing and low calorie dinner.  We served it with Cole slaw dressing.

I had these back in the late 70s at a Chinese restaurant made with chicken livers.  The chestnut gives you crunch and texture. I am going to sprinkle some lemon pepper on the shrimp in stead of teriyaki. I may pre cook the bacon so it gets done without over cooking the Shrimp ??

Truly awesome for all those meat/bacon lovers out there. I didn't have the water chestnuts, so these are totally still delicious without that extra flavor, unless you're a real flavor snob like me. Next time I might add in some dates or brown sugar, something sweet to really offset the savory flavor and crank it up a notch.

The flavored in this did not meld together well for me. The water chestnut just made it taste bland. I will not be making this again.
