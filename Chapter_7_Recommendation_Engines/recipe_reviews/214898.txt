Excellent basic sauce recipe.  Easy to prepare great flavor.  Substituted red wine for the water.  This sauce is full of flavor and coats the pasta evenly.  Will be adding this one to the regular rotation.  You should definitely try this one.

Delicious! I was concerned at first, but it turned out lovely. Here's some hints I found useful: if using dried instead of fresh basil, use only four teaspoons. I also found that I didn't need the 1/4 cup water, and added used two tablespoons whole wheat flour rather than one all purpose. Also, you can just use a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, and if you want to save some calories, only use one teaspoon margarine rather than a tablespoon butter, and omit the oil. It will still taste great.

This really was a fantastic and simple recipe. I love that I can make it using all-natural ingredients. I didn't have any small tomatoes, so I used 4 large ones instead, and it still turned out great. I also had some ready-to-serve portobello mushroom Italian sausage in my fridge, so I threw that in there. This was my first attempt at making homemade pasta sauce and I will definitely be doing this again. Really and truly amazing.

This is a wonderfully easy, quick sauce. We didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand, but two cans of diced tomatoes worked just fine. It was so delicious, the man of the house did the dishes. Any recipe that can get him to wash dishes deserves all five stars!

This was a great, light sauce! Don't expect that all day simmering thick sauce, this is just a perfect fresh easy way to use up your garden veggies. We had it with ricotta ravioli and salad for a fast and delightfully homemade Friday night dinner. Thanks! :)

Loved it!  It was nice to find a tomato sauce that didn't have sugar in it but still didn't have a bitter taste.  Made this with home grown tomatoes and basil.  Loved it's freshness.

This was just ok for me. It tasted very basil-y when I tasted just the sauce, but once mixed with pasta it seemed to have no flavour at all. I also added some wine. It didn't say anywhere (nor in the reviews I read) that the tomatoes should be peeled, but I would have much preferred it that way; that's just a personal preference thing though I guess. I also wish I'd taken my hand blender to it so that it would be more 'saucy' instead of chunky, but again that's my preference. This was very quick and simple though, so I would try it again with additional/different seasonings. One last comment, maybe I just like my pasta particularly saucy but this wasn't even close to 4 servings for me. Make more if you have a big family or want some extra to freeze. Thanks for the recipe though, it was a good start for me for making my first made-from-fresh-tomatoes sauce.

This was fabulous and the perfect summer gravy recipe.  Fresh tomatoes and fresh basil make this light and tasty whether served over pasta or spaghetti squash.  If you grow nothing else in your garden, this recipe is worth growing plum tomatoes and basil for!

Great recipe.  I used a bit more olive oil because I live the taste of it.  My husband and I visited Italy a few months ago and this is how my family who lives there makes their sauce.  In America, we oversauce pasta...this is a light, tasty way of eating pasta with sauce.  Use some great olive oil and this makes a fantastic, authentic Italian sauce.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!

This was a nice, basic red sauce that clings to the noodles so every bite is full of flavor.  Lots of potential here - I'll keep this in my recipe box and tweak to my personal tastes.

This was a great recipe.  Made a very small amount so, I added an additional can of diced toms and more  spices. I also sauteed the garlic and some diced onion with the tomatoes.

Yummy!  So easy and so much better than store bought.  I didn’t have fresh tomatoes so I used two cans of diced tomatoes per another suggestion.  I also added oregano, Italian seasoning, additional garlic, and a few dashes of cayenne for a bit of kick.  Blended it with the stick blender to smooth it out and voilà…delicious!

This was a hit! I made it with some friends, and it was so delicious and authentic to gorge on afterward! I didn't have garlic salt, but it turned out fine. I would still add it if you have it to make it better. I included a little extra butter and basil because I do love those two things. I added probably 1/3 cup basil, and I sprinkled the pepper liberally according to my taste. I have never had a fresher sauce in such a long time! Wonderful recipe that I'll enjoy using over again. :)

I also suggest adding a vegetable or two with the pasta.

I am just getting the hang of cooking and wanted to make my own sauce.  This is soooo easy.  I made it pretty much like it reads... Probably had too much tomato, but it's tomato sauce, so wasn't worried.  Didn't have fresh basil, so dry was fine.  Also I found that a splash of lemon juice made it tangy... but that's how I like it.  Made it with eggplant meatballs over some noodles.  Oh yeah!!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Oh yes!! Oh very much yes!! When I make this again I hope to have at least 3 times as many roma tomatoes from the garden (I had them ripening after picking for a couple days but still had to add two large beefsteaks.) I used half red wine / half water and thickened with both flour and parmesan cheese. This is among my very favorite pasta sauces!

I used this as a base for a sauce I created for a low-iodine diet I have to do for a battle with thyroid cancer. You really only need to substitute a couple things:
the butter for margarine or a little more olive oil
the garlic salt for plain garlic powder
the salt for un-iodized table salt

When I got the sauce done, I sauteed some chopped green peppers, onions and mushrooms in olive oil. I then cooked up some ground beef and made quite a hearty sauce! All the basil and garlic makes this a great recipe unaltered or one to play around with. I think it would be great with shrimp- but not on the low-iodide diet! :)

All in all very tasty and EASY!

For a first-time sauce maker (me) this was an excellent starter recipe. I did deviate a bit based on our tastes- doubled the fresh basil, doubled the minced garlic, added onion and oregano (about 2 tsp dried) and used sea salt instead of garlic salt. After cooking, I pureed it - also added a pinch of sugar. So while I changed it quite a bit- this was an excellent base and quick to make!

Really, Really good!!!  It was much easier to make than I imagined homemade pasta sauce would be.  I am never buying Ragu again.  I did omit the olive oil and used 4 tsp. dried basil.  I also threw in a bell pepper that I had from the garden.  So good!!

UPDATE JUNE 22, 2011: I made this sauce again for lunch without the flour and water and it was delicious. My 2 and 3 year old boys devoured their pasta and had second helpings. This makes for a great quick sauce that can be cooked up as the pasta is cooking.  JUNE 20, 2011: I would like to give this sauce more points but I feel that it only deserves 3 points. After adding the flour, it made the tomato sauce really pasty and gooey. The preferred method to thicken up tomato sauce is to let it reduce rapidly over high heat, or slowly over medium/low heat, to the desired consistancy. This sauce is perfect without the addition of flour and water at the end. The other change I made was adding garlic powder and salt to taste because I had no garlic salt. I will make this again but omiting the flour and water at the end. Just add the minced garlic along with the olive oil and basil and cook accordingly.

try putting the flour and water into a container with a lid- and shaking to dissolve and then add to sauce. this will prevent any lumps.

This was a great recipe. Like others said is was an amazing base.  My husband and son commented all through the meal how good it tasted and smelled. Based on other reviewers below are all the tweaks I did.
I used 4 tsp of dried basil but would recommend using fresh when possible. I use red wine instead of water. Yum!  I increased the garlic to 4 cloves and added a tsp of ground peppercorn and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. I didn't have garlic salt so I used sea salt.
 It is nice to add a 1/2 can of tomaoto paste  (I've tried both ways) , it is ok either way.
I tried a 1/2 tsp of lemon juice  and a dash of cayenne for zip..not there yet but getting there.
I normally add 3/4 to 1 lbs ground beef and used 4-5 large tomato instead of 8 small tomatoes but  following the current recipe make a meal that barely fed 3 adults . Other than wanting more and having to scrape the pot this is a  great receipe

I just happen to stumble across this recipe because I had fresh tomatoes that I needed to use before they went bad and I sure am glad I found this. I had 3 red vine tomatoes, and I used a 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes w/the juice and added another 1/2 tbsp flour. I also added a can of mushrooms, 2 garlic cloves, and i used 1 tbsp of dry basil. Fabulous!! Had it with lean hot italian sausage links and garlic bread. Next time I would double the recipe for leftovers. This only fed 2 people. This was super good!! BF said before trying it "this is not enough sauce" I said, "just try it". Come to find out he was amazed with it and said it was the perfect amount of sauce and has requested me to make this more often! Def. a keeper!!

Very salty.  When and if I make this again I substitute fresh garlic for garlic salt and add salt to taste.

This sauce was fantastic and tasted like summer! I have my usual family recipe that's been around for years that I normally make, and it's quite hearty filled with tons of veggies and meat, but this was a nice change of pace.  I made it exactly as written and would only suggest maybe adding a pinch of sugar. For the tomatoes I used 8 Roma Tomatoes - these are naturally sweeter, have fewer seeds and hold up really well in sauces. I see others have suggested red wine instead of the water - this would work well too if you have it, and I might try that next time if I have a bottle open.  I don't understand the reviews saying this is "too salty", when the recipe clearly states you are to add salt "TO TASTE". If it's too salty, then that's your own fault. Taste as you cook.  Also, since this is a quick sauce, the flour thickens it, instead of simmering it for hours to thicken.  Yes, the texture might be a little better without the flour, but for the short cooking time, it has its purpose.  I found the sauce to be very flavorful and I wish I had made more.  The servings sizes are a little small - I found this made 4 side servings. If you are looking for a main entree, then this would make 2 servings. This is a perfect way to use up all that crazy, out of control basil that's growing in my garden. A nice chunky sauce that you can blend up a bit if you prefer a smoother consistency. Thank you Kayleigh for sharing your recipe!

Added a bit extra garlic as well as ground beef and Italian seasoning. Was great! Had fresh lemon basil from the garden.

This recipe was simple and delicious and the perfect way to use up the tomatoes from my garden. I followed the recipe with the exception of the water. I used white wine instead and it came out very tasty. I also sauteed about 4 cloves of minced garlic in the butter, then added the tomatoes. I also added sea salt and a little sugar instead of the garlic salt. I can't want to make this again, next time with more tomatoes!

Fresh tomatoes and garlic from the garden, this is a keeper.  I doubled the recipe since it sounded good.  It looked like a little too much garlic salt, so I split it to be half garlic salt and half galic powder.  Next time I will probably go with other suggestions and experiment.

Instead of using fresh tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  The sauce was delicious over a bed of pasta!  Perfectly seasoned and creamy.  Definitely a keeper!

Made this last night and it was delicious.  Coats the pasta evenly.   Came out a little salty for my taste so next time will only use the garlic salt and omit adding regular salt too.  Will trying subbing water for red wine next time as well.

This was delicious!!  I added a little italian seasoning and red pepper flakes (cause we love spicy) and used red wine instead of water.  YUM! My hubby wished it was a little thicker, but overall great flavor, easy, and fast!  Will definitely make again!!

This was ahh-mazing!! I did change it a bit! First I didn't have as many tomatoes as needed so I used a can of crushed tomatoes and one regular tomato. I also added chopped garlic and onions in the beginning with the tomatoes. I did everything as stated but didn't have fresh basil on hand so used 4 teaspoons dried (as mentioned by another user)! I also added the flour and didn't feel the need for the water! It was seriously so delish that my roommates raved, and I couldn't stop eating!

Very simple, quick and easy.  This is not going to be a thick, smooth sauce like the jars in the store, but a fresh, chunky sauce.  I like other sauces better, I must admit, but this is a good way to use up tomatoes (I had 4 beefsteak tomatoes to use up) and is pretty tasty.  I left out the water--in my experience, tomatoes are watery enough--and just used olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan.  Served over mini penne and had a nice, quick, filling lunch with salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

The whole family loved this recipe. At the end I added a half an onion, some chopped mushrooms, and tripled the amount of garlic the recipe called for, but I tasted it before that and thought it was delicious then too. So much better than store-bought. I will make this again and again.

I found the taste of this sauce underwhelming.  I followed the recipe except that I added some onion and swapped out the butter for EVOO.  I could not taste the fresh basil or the garlic in the sauce. The recipe definitely needs tweaking.

Wow.  Soooooo good.  Soooooo easy.  I will be making more next time for leftovers.  Yum, yum, yum.  I only had 6 ripe roma tomatoes on hand, so I added a can of diced tomatoes and poured the rest of my cabernet sauvigion into the pan after the water, a couple more cloves of garlic, lots o fresh chopped basil....voila....restaurant-quality tomato basil sauce.  YOU GOTTA MAKE THIS!

This was really good. The color was absolutely gorgeous! I used homegrown heirloom tomatoes that were frozen and basil from the garden. I used 4 tomatoes since they were large. It was a bit too salty for my taste so I think next time I will skip the salt since there is garlic salt in the recipe. Very easy and tasty sauce that I will be making often. Thank you for sharing it :)

Great base recipe!  Quick, easy, but I did make some tweaks for the meatballs I added to it. Substituted white wine for the water, added some oregano, and doubled the garlic. I love garlic!

Excellent recipe. I used eight small tomatoes picked fresh from the garden and put them in a food processor. Instead of 1/4 cup water I used an 1/8 cup wine and an 1/8 cup water. I did not use flour but simmered the sauce for 30 minutes. Perfection. The basil and fresh tomatoes were superb.

Great recipe! I added mushrooms, onion, oregano and thyme. The only thing I would advise against adding is the extra water. I also substituted squash/zucchini “pasta” for a great vegan dish. Solid

It was so good.   I pretty much followed the recipe and use different kind of tomatoes though and I used fewer and just chopped them up very fine I’m telling you it’s the best I’ve ever had.   I usually add more spices though.

The basil in the original recipe is too much. I would recommend cutting the amount of basil at least in half.

Very easy if you dice up the tomatoes beforehand.  Made this as a side dish to go with Chef John's Chicken Parmesan and the family loved it!  Used plum tomatoes and doubled the use of actual minced garlic instead of the garlic sauce.  Used Penne pasta which the sauce covered.  Nest  time I'll make it I intend to use some fresh grates parmesan on top as it is dished up.

I also sub’d red wine for the water.  Simply superb.   The complex flavors of the reduced wine with tomatoes and basil were GRAND.  Next time will double the recipe...

Doubled the recipe and used wine instead of water.  No flour added small can tomato paste.  1 tsp Italian seasoning.  Didn't have fresh basil so used idea of 4 tsp dried basil from another reviewer.  Sauteed fresh mushrooms and added them along with both onion powder and garlic powder.  Simmered while meatballs baked.  Turned out great.  Lots of flavor.  Very easy.

This is an easy and delicious recipe! I needed a quick sauce to use some tomatoes out of my garden and this recipe did just that. I strongly suggest removing the skin from the tomatoes first. I omitted the water and garlic salt and  doubled the fresh garlic. Will be making it again for sure!

Just made this for dinner. I really don't believe in changing the original recipe because once you change the recipe given, it's not truly an authentic rating. With this said, I followed one review that suggested red wine instead of the water. What a difference!!! Much more flavorful than the water. I saved my family of 5 and this wasn't quite enough sauce. Next time, I will double! I also used Roma tomatoes and tomatoes on a vine. This recipe is delicious and I will definitely make again :)

This was an awesome basic recipe. I didn't use flour, added extra water, used dried basil and a couple other spices and simmered it a lot longer so the flavor was better. Added a little parmesan cheese, sour cream, half & half and made it a creamy tomato meat sauce to go over blanched butternut squash instead of noodles for a healthier dish. It was awesome and the hubbs actually liked it...he does NOT like tomato sauces. Did make a small batch of noodles for the kiddo to eat and she devoured it as well. Will definitely make this again. A+ in my book!

This is awesome! I ran out of olive oil, so I used walnut oil instead, and it still tasted fantastic! I don't think I would call it 4 servings if you are a fan of tons of pasta sauce on your pasta, but it is sooo worth making it rather than buying it in a jar.
