My husband scarfed this down - he is a big salmon fan.  I thought it was good (but will change a few things next time)  and will serve it to family for brunch next weekend.  I will reduce the oil as someone else has suggested, and maybe add some diced tomatoes (personal preference- I put them on almost everything) *I would definitely recommend adding the salmon when the onions are just about done. Great alternative to corned beef hash :)

Overall - a Great flavour combination. I was a bit unsure of ketchup and mustard...but it turned out very tasty. I will keep this recipe but would cut out some of the oil. I was intending to make 2 portions but ended up eating it all in one go! I added some capers to add a bit of zing - but quite fine without them.

This is a really great recipe, though I found the directions unnecessarily confusing. I basically just saute onions, and fry potatoes until softened and slightly crisp/golden brown. In parallel, I fry two pieces of salmon (I don't use filets). As everything is frying, I prep the sauce. I double the sauce recipe, as I find that the original amount does not completely coat all of the ingredients. I've also recently substituted dried rosemary for fresh dill in the sauce as I was out of the latter. I found this to be even tastier (and less messy) than using dill which I did the first time I made it. Once the salmon is slightly fried, to the point of being softened, I allow it to cool for a few minutes and then mince the fish meat with a knife/my fingers, removing any bones. I then combine potatoes, onions, and salmon  in a big frying pan (by this point each is fully cooked), and allow it to fry for 5 mins mixing frequently. Two minutes before I am about to turn off the heat, I pour on the sauce and mix thoroughly. Results are extremely delicious!

Really fantastic, I wish I'd taken a picture! It was so, so good, I served it with buttermilk mashed potatoes with green onions and it was great.  I broiled my salmon filet with some olive oil, dried oregano, salt & pepper and then when it was done I flaked it with a fork into bite size pieces.

I skipped the ketchup/mustard combo and instead just added dried dill to the whole concoction.  I served it with the creamy dill dip (from this site) on the side as an optional thing but everyone ended up using it and raved about how good it was.
Overall, great idea.  (Love it with poached eggs as well!)

This was just ok.  Edible, but nothing special.  The fish was overcooked, I should have added it at the end of the onions, or cooked separately.

Excellent hash, and a nice change from the typical corned-beed: crusty, brown, and delicious.  I didn't think browned salmon would be so tasty.  Because it is such a good basic recipe, it's easy to mix and match proteins and herb flavorings.  Just follow the same preparation directions and it will turn out great.

Not bad.  I was looking for something to do with left over baked salmon.  I'm not a big salmon lover so wanted something more than the salmon and rice and found this.  Simple to make and quick.  From start to table in about 20 minutes.  I used left over cooked salmon and tossed it in the pan for the last 2 minutes with the onions to warm up.  And I used 1 tbs dried dill.

This was wonderful! I was skeptical about the ketchup and mustard, but it was lovely together. I also reduced the amount of oil. As a whole, my family and I aren't too keen on dill, so I used fresh rosemary (half the amount that was listed for the dill) and a little lemon thyme. I also added a drizzle of honey to the dressing as I wanted to use Dijon mustard, but also have that little hint of sweetness. WONDERFUL! Give this one a go!

This recipe was so easy to make and my whole family loved it.  I used 1 T. of dried dill weed since I had no fresh on hand and it turned out great.  Definitely will make again for breakfast, lunch or dinner!

It was quite good.  I was tempted to leave the mustard/ketchup out of the recipe but then I thought where would the flavor come from so I used honey mustard instead of Dijon and I was pleasantly surprised.  Only had red potatoes and they were a bit too solid ... next time I'll use, as suggested, a more starchy potato other than that I was pleasantly pleased.

This was really good! My boys loved it. A little salmon goes a long way with this recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I used Asian sweet potatoes and my own Dijon vinaigrette dressing, rather than the ketchup. I also added chopped celery and garlic (which I add to everything). It was a big hit.

I scaled this back to one portion but otherwise I made this as written.  I was skeptical about the mustard and ketchup but I really couldn't taste either of them and there wasn't enough to coat the hash.  If I were to make this again I would add a splash of fresh lemon juice.

This recipe is great, especially with some red bell peppers and wasabi mayo. Me and my family really liked this and would definitely make this again.

I've been craving hash for a few days and decided to use the frozen salmon I had thawed in the fridge overnight. I changed the sauce recipe though, Instead of dill, I used parsley, ketchup, yellow mustard, franks hot sauce, lemon juice instead of water and real maple syrup. I prefer my hash mashed, so I mashed it all together in the pan and it came out delicious!

We loved this! I accidentally used baby yams instead of potatoes which ended up tasting awesome. I added bell peppers, shallots, and fresh garlic as a matter of personal taste. It was delicious and a nice alternative for salmon.

Delicious and easy.  Added some butter to the potatoes towards the end to brown them more and add some more flavor.  Our new go to!!

Delicious use of left-over salmon cooked the night before. I added the salmon just before the onions were done. Definitely a keeper for me.
