Just wanted to add that I changed some things from last time (todays date is February 21st 2008): Combine the margarine, sugars, eggs, vanilla, raisin bran and oats till mixed, it will come out slightly runny mixture.  then I added in the chocolate chips, raisins, coconut and nuts (everything except the dry ingredients (except for the oats that were added previously)) this allows a quicker mix and less elbow grease.  I also refrigerated them over night then rolled them into golf ball size balls then baked them.  One friend suggested Crasins would be a nice touch.  Over the years when I have made these cookies I have always gotten rave reviews.  Several times they were even requested to be made.  Thay are good and our boys even ask for them over the other cookies I have made.  What makes this recipe unique from others is that you can change it to what you like.  I have added peanutbutter chips in and butterscotch chips as well.  My mom even added dates to hers before while we were growing up.  This recipe has been passed down through our generations so I hope it will become a keepsake for your family as it has become for ours.  Enjoy.

I've always loved this recipe, it makes the best cookies. I'm not a big raisin person so instead of raisin bran and raisins I use 2 cups of cornflakes and a 12oz bag of chocolate chips. The cookies come out soft and so chewy. I bake them for about 7 or 8 minutes.

This is a very super duper big good cookies. I like it, don't care if one of the reviewer complaints about the calories. I use molasses to replace the brown sugar and only use 1/2 of white sugar called in the recipe. (I halved the recipe so for me it was 1/2cup). I make mine extra large, 10cm in diameter (view photo). Thanks for sharing, will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe many times over the past year and it always scores 11 on a scale of l0.  It is wonderful to take to 'new' mothers who don't have time to eat because the cookies are so nutritious.  I have also frozen them in packs of ten and just take along a pack if I have to take something along.  Delicious and nutritious!

The name fascinated me and I had to try them.  Our customers loved them.  They made big pretty cookies that had a unique taste and texture.  They were very light and crisp on the outside, and dense, sticky and chewy on the inside.  The chocolate chips and raisins were great together.  We added a sign on the cookies that said "No actual buffalo were harmed in the making of this cookie," and we got some laughs.  Thanks, Dawn.

I loved these cookies.  I took them to work and two separate people told me that I should sell them.  I told them it was a recipe I got from the internet.  I would recomend halving or even quartering this recipe, the one written out here makes far more than 2 or 3 people could eat in two days.  I say two days because that is how long you have to eat them before they start getting stale.  Then again, these cookies are so good, you could probably live off them for 2 days.

These turned out really good.  I only made half a batch and I still got just over 5 dozen cookies.  I made a couple minor adjustments:  I used softened butter rather than melted margarine, a little less brown sugar (I didn't pack it in the measuring cup), corn flakes instead of raisin bran, and I switched the measurements for the raisins and the chocolate chips (for half a batch, I used 1/2 cup raisins and 1 cup choc. chips.)  I also upped the oats and cornflakes by about 1/2 cup each.  Oh, and I used pecans instead of walnuts, since I'm allergic to walnuts.  I think these would be good with other dried fruit and perhaps some spices like cinnamon as well.

Good way to use up raisin bran, but I did customize to lower sugar and fat--a little.   They turned out really great and picky 10 year old, who can't stand raisins or raisin bran, loves them.    I cut sugar by 1-1/2 cups by using 1 c brown, and 1 c white, and 1/2 cup agave syrup; I cut fat a teeny bit by using 1/2 c butter, 1 c butter flavored shortening, and--lacking applesauce--using 1/2 c pureed pumpkin (really!).  I reduced flour to 3-1/2 cups and added an extra cup of raisin bran.  And finally, fearing pumpkin taste, added 3 T baking cocoa.

These are great!  I am always asked for the recipe when I share them with others.  Here are my tweaks:  Reduce amount of raisins to your preference, there are already lots of them coming from the Raisin Bran cereal.  Really stuff the measuring cup with lots of coconut.  Increase walnuts to 3/4 cup.  Use dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  Resist the temptation to increase the amount of chocolate chips.  Make the cookies whatever size you like.  They don't have to be huge.

This is a great recipe! It makes a ton of cookies, I made 11 dozen from these measurements with my 1 tablespoon cookie scoop. So, I guess that will cut the calories down a bit :) With my house full of boys it worked out good, I am able to freeze several dozen.I did not have any raisin bran cereal so I used a store brand granola with raisin cereal instead. It was high in sugar (19grams per serving) so I cut back the white sugar to 1 2/3 cups, I may cut it back a little more next time. I also used whole wheat flour not white and you can't even tell, my boys will never know I added something good for them.

This is the best recipe but I use the Splenda brown sugar (half the amount it calls for) and I use cornflakes instead of raisin bran (raisins are too sweet for us) and I omit the extra  raisins and substitute slivered almonds ...I use unsweetened coconut and whole wheat flour ...

Next time you make this recipe, try using Splenda's brown sugar and Splenda for Baking as a substitute for the sugars.  The calorie count goes way down!!

Thank you Dawn, I have been searching for this recipe since the mid 90's when a co-worker in Oklahoma City made them and wouldn't share her Grandmothers "secret" recipe. She did mention that the cookies were made with cornflakes (not raisin bran like yours) but they sure taste like I remember them...YUM! Thanks again.

I really like the texture of this cookie!  It is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I ended up cutting the recipe in half, and I'm glad I did since half the recipe still made 4 dozen cookies.  I used mini chocolate chips -- they worked out really well.  I will definately make these again.  Thank you!

These were very good but I found them to be a little too sweet and a little too soft for my liking.  I cut the raisins down to 1-1/2 cups, which seemed like plenty, and I accidentally used cornflakes instead of bran flakes, but it didn't seem to affect the overall taste.  I would like to make them again with the bran flakes and cut back some on the brown and white sugars and cut the raisins back to 1 cup.  I was able to get 6 dozen 3" diameter cookies.  Makes A LOT!

These were not bad.  A little too sweet for my taste.  I, personally, would have liked a richer, more buttery flavored cookie.  It's ok...my thighs really didn't need them anyway.  My four sons liked them, so that works for me!

This is a great recipe...and it makes a boat load of cookies! I started calling it "The Kitchen Sink Cookie" since I was using every ingredient in the house, and then some.
I was running shy on some and did some substitutions and they still turned out great. Since I didn't have Bran Flakes on hand I used pulverized granola and then some wheat germ. I didn't have any nuts either, but the golden raisins were excellent with the choc. chips. The batter got so thick after adding all the dry ingredients I felt like I got my workout for the day.
I took about 2 doz. to our 4th of July party and they vanished. I was able to take even more to work the next day. I still have a dozen in the fridge and more in the freezer! I will make this recipe again. Hopefully i can try it the way it was meant to be made.

This recipe is awesome. So easy to make. I cook them a little longer. Put two sheets with 9 cookies each and cook them for 6 minutes then alternate them for another 6 minutes. Delicious. Crispy on outside and soft and chewy on inside. Don't change a thing. Thanks for the recipe.

Okay ... we got more than 4 dozen ... which is good, as we really like them!  I did find that they needed more than 10 minutes in the oven.

I didn't have enough raisins in the house, so we used cherry infused craisins - this was a wonderful addition to the recipe.  I can see these are a GREAT base for all kinds of mix-ins!

These are by far the most popular of the cookies I've brought to work or used in Christmas packages. They are the perfect mix between traditional oatmeal and regular chocolate chip cookies. I use butter instead of margarine and usually make them with walnuts.

The kids love making these because there is so much "stuff" in them.  We've made some changes to suit our taste:  One third less of brown and white sugar, 3 cups raisin bran (or bran flakes), 1.5 cups oatmeal, 1 tsp. baking powder and we add salt.  We make 9 or 10 dozen smaller cookies rather than 4 dozen large.

Followed another suggestion of reducing white sugar to 1 cup and 2 cups loosely packed brown sugar. Had no raisins so used Craisins and large dark chocolate chips. Also used 2cups butter instead of margarine. Awesome!!!

Love, love, love!  I have been making this recipe for over 15 yrs.  I am so glad I found it on allrecipes. I go a little heavy on the nuts and a lighter on the chocolate chips.  This coolie always gets compliments.

I had some left over Raisin Bran I wanted to use so I entered it in allrecipes ingredient search and found this recipe.  I made these cookies and the only changes I made were to use 1/2 of the raisins and the other half craisins.  I also cut back on the sugar by using 1 c white and 2 c brown not packed but leveled.  These were delicious! I will absolutely make these again. Crunchy around the edges, soft and chewy inside.  Yum!

I replaced half butter and half applesauce for the margarine and  replaced the white sugar with Stevia.  They turned out great and once you cut back on the fat and sugar, they are nutritious, too!  I will be making these again and next time trying dried cranberries instead of raisins.

Well, I made golf ball size scoops - and still got 6 dozen!  lol  Substituted Splenda for the white sugar, and added 3 heaping teaspoons of cocoa because I only had about 2/3 cup chocolate chips. And, I used about 1 and 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour with the rest as white flour.

Husband thought they were great and even commented they were good for him - he doesn't know about my substitutions...hehe  and I'm not telling him.  Also, increased cooking time by 2 min.

These are awesome cookies! Very easy to make and simply delicious. Instead of raisin bran, I used a multigrain cereal with flax then added golden raisins separately. Everyone who's tried them has loved them.

This makes a LOT of cookies.  They are wonderful though.  I dont think I would have normally made them, since the list of ingredients is so long, but I had everything on hand and was trying to use up Raisin Bran since I had 3 boxes of it.  The cookies have a wonderful chewy and crispy texture.  Very good.
