I had a very difficult time deciding how to rate this recipe. While I loved the consistency of the sauce and the meatballs were very moist , I found that everything lacked flavour and that the sauce was very acidic. Both the meatballs and the sauce need more seasonings and salt, personal preference perhaps.   I followed the recipe as written and it was ready after four hours on low.  Thanks for sharing.
