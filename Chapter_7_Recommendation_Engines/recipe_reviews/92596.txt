My sister made these for a family gathering (fresh out of the frying pan, no coating). I couldn't believe how rich they tasted! There were 5 of us "fighting" over the last two. Some tips she gave were: to make sure you find a nice moist brand of dates that are not stringy; to use semi-fatty, regular cut or thick cut bacon that won't crisp too quick but will add lots of liquid/fat to soften up the dates a bit; and to find a chorizo that isn't to hard (if you can only find a harder chorizo, you should pan fry the chunks a bit in olive oil to soften them up, but be careful not to overcook and make it tougher!)

The chorizo and bacon flavors fought each other, and the dates turned to mush in between.  What a waste of good ingredients.
