I've been making this for over 25 years, and it's very good [I've only used ground beef]. One thing that just doesn't make sense about this recipe...if you remove the foil before baking, why poke the holes? My recipe says to poke holes in the foil, and then bake in the foil...this makes sense!

This is a great sausage to make with elk! It has a mild flavor and the whole family liked it. I let it set in the fridge for 3 days and mixed it at least once a day to blend the flavors. We only have a small part of one roll left!(I made it less than a week ago!)

Wow! This is great. I refridgerated it for 24hrs. I cooked in foil with some holes on top, I will add some to the bottom next time. I baked until it reached 155 degrees. I love corn beef and this tasted just like it. So easy and such a great result.

Been making this for years, sept for I add a few things to it like, onion powder, garlic powder, worchestershire sauce and a little ground red pepper. also let stand in fridge for 24 hours in logs, then boil cook it on a rolling boil for 1 hour, this makes it much leaner as most of the fat is boiled out. All in all great stuff, I usually make it in very large batches and give it out to family and friends durring the holidays.
