WoW...
This dish was delicious.  I marinated the vegetables for about 30min in sweet onion vinaigrette, and I think this is what made it so mouth watering.  I will definitely make this again, and suggest it to all.  I also used fresh dill, which added extra flavour.

Yummy! I used zucchini, yellow squash, onions, and mushrooms, which blended really well with the cheese. Makes a great sack lunch item too...

Be sure to thaw the filo before preparing the vegetables.  I use almost twice as many veggies- spinach, zuchhini, brocoli, peppers, onion, leeks etc to make it more filling.  Be sure to add spices you like- I use about 3 times as much dill and add basil and onion powder.  Since I use more veggies I make more egg/cheese mixture.  My husband also loves this dish.

The idea is good but the pie needs a lot more to make it great. It needs almost double the amount of vegetables, and more cheese/egg mixture to hold it all together. The flavours were nice but did not bind well. I used broccoli, red peppers, sweet potatoes, carrots, and green beans. I sauted half an onion and a few cloves of garlic and added that to the cheese mixture.

I made lots of modifications because I used what I had on hand. (1) For the 5 cups of veggies I used an 8oz bag of spinach roughly chopped, 6 md. Cremini mushrooms chopped, 1/3 onion finely chopped (omitted powder), and 1/2 cup cooked brown lentils. (2) Used 1 Tbsp fresh oregano instead of dill. (3) I fried the onion and mushrooms, then added the spinach and covered until it wilted. I drained and squeezed the veggie mixture. (4) I used way more phyllo sheets than asked for, and created lots of layers with olive oil between every two sheets.  Loved it!! Great flavour.

I used broccoli, sweet potato, onion, green beans, zucchini, & red pepper; lightly steamed them, then marinated them in a vinaigrette dressing to add flavor.  Added garlic powder & the onion powder to the egg mixture, and made everything else as written.  Wonderful way to help me use up phyllo dough; very nice and I would make it again!  Thank you, Anne!

Overall I thought this was a really good recipe.  I used red and yellow peppers, onions, broccoli, zucchini and squash.  The only suggestion I would make would be to add an extra sheet of phyllo dough to the top once you have folded all the sides up.  Other than that, the recipe was awesome!

This was very, very tasty- even for our 3 year old.  I also have made it with cooked chicken breast.  Excellent!

My family really enjoyed this recipe - and I forgot the dill weed!  I will try again, seems you could make it a different recipe each time with different veggies.  Oh, I also put many more veggies in and doubled the egg/feta mixture.  Thanks!

I was looking for a way to use some leftover Phyllo dough and found this yummy recipe!  It was a great hit with my kids!  It looked really yummy and smelled so good too!  I used zucchini, celery, carrots, broccoli, onion and tomato... I used lots of veggies so doubled the egg mixture and I also added some chicken, ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese and mozzarella (instead of the feta because I didn't have any) in the mixture.  I took it out of the oven with 10 minutes left and topped it with parmesan and more mozzarella cheese and chopped tomatoes! Then put it back in for the last 10 minutes to melt, brown and get toasty good. Yummy!

To be honest..i didn't like the way this turned out at all. It was very bland and need some sort of "kick" and it also needs more vegetables than the recipe asks for. i don't think i will make this recipe again. :X

Wonderful way to use the left over veges (I used my left overs grilled veges from night before and added quite a bit of extras as well.  It is important to use the thawed dough.  Depending on the taste buds, you could also spice it up a wee bit and maybe add various left over cheese as well.  One way to to clean the fridge of left overs from the summer BBQs.  Great vege dish.  I will be using this frequently thanks again

yummy. I read the reviews and added another egg, about 7 cups of vegetables (broccoli, zuchinni, green onion, carrots) and probablly about 1 cup of feta because I wanted to use up the rest of the container and it was delicious. A definite make again for me. Thanks for posting.

I couldn't understand how reviewers could find this recipe bland with garlic, onion powder and feta, but it was.  Maybe it depends on the mix of vegetables.  I used eggplant, zucchini and broccoli, two of which admittedly don't have particularly distinctive or strong flavors.  I used probably more than twice the amount of vegetables and also doubled the egg mixture to compensate as others did and thought I had "dumped" in enough extra seasoning, including the dill and even oregano.  Still disappointing flavor-wise, although my family disagreed with me.  Steaming also doesn't impart any flavor, as sauteing would, but I liked the idea of not adding extra fat, so am not inclined to change that technique.  I think the basic concept is promising though, and would try it again with even more and stronger seasoning.  I didn't have the patience to let the filo completely defrost and paid the price of the sheets breaking.  I used pieces for the bottom anyway and that worked, and had large enough portions to hang over the sides of the pan and fold over the top anyway.  Just didn't put them across the entire bottom of the pan.  Next time, I'll wait longer or take the filo out of the freezer sooner!

This was a fantastic meat-free meal to have, and very quick to put together. Next time I would add some more herbs and maybe a feta cheese with a flavour through it.

This was very good and had much better flavor than I expected it to have.  I used a little more cheese than called for and mixed feta with muenster since I didn't have enough feta, and that had a more mild flavor which I liked.  I used broccoli, zucchini, onions, carrots and sweet potato and 1 leek, which I did not steam with the rest of the veggies (just added to the mixture before baking).  I marinated the veggies and spices for about an hour in a balsamic vinaigrette and then added the cheese and egg mixture before putting it all together.  I think this could possibly use more cheese / egg mixture, but the low amount kept the dish lighter and healthier.  Overall this was very good and a great way to get in lots of veggies in one meal! I gave it four stars because I found the recipe to be somewhat vague.  Thanks to all the other reviewers for their suggestions / modifications.

Used leftover turkey and frozen peas and carrots to equal 5 cups.   Substituted parmesan cheese for feta.  Delicious, more healthful alternative to turkey pot pie.

Excellent!  I was just looking for something to use up my extra phyllo dough, but I will be using this recipe many more times.  I used zucchini, eggplant, red bell pepper, onions, mushrooms and a little corn.  I did not use the onion powder because I was using onions already.  Thanks for the recipe, it was great!

Very good base for whatever vegetables you want to use.. I used zucchini, mush, onions, chopped steamed brocolli and it turned out fantastic. .. This will be a staple in my house. I also ommitted feta and used Spanish cheese instead. AND, I used 4 beaten eggs and baked for 40 minutes.

For my veggies I used Mediterranean flavors: eggplant, mushrooms, zucchini, green onion, spinach, and red bell pepper.  My spinach was fresh, so I rinsed it, blanched it, and chopped it before mixing it in with the rest of the veggies.  I sauteed all the veggies together, adding a little oregano and lots of basil.  I used about 3/4 C feta, plus a couple tablespoons grated Asiago since I had it.  This turned out very well - at a work potluck the pan was cleaned out in the first 20 minutes, and to many compliments.  I will definitely do this one again.

This was alright... not my favorite. I would reccomend making changes and if you have never worked with phyllo dough, you may want to try this more than once. I think it is a good concept but the flavor just wasn't there for me.

Another great phyllo pastry recipe! I used a mix of zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms plus a lot of spices. We ate this as a main with a simple green salad on the side. Definitely a good way to get hubby to share my vegetarian meal! :)

We made this recipe for a dinner party the other night, and all 10 people cleaned their plates.
Its a great alternative to veggie lasagna!

The tase was great, I used 1 onino,1 sweet bell pepper and 3/4 lb of fresh green beans, 2 cloves of garlic and about 1 cup of leftover rotisserie chicken. Instead of steaming I sauteed everything first until almost done, then proceeded as written. My only complaint is that the phyllo dough didnt really have the texture I thought it would. The top layer was brown an flaky but the rest was like eating a stack of newspaper.  Next time I will try to use a little butter or oil between the layers and see it that helps.

Boring!  Just bland and boring.  I upped the egg to 2 and dumped a ton of feta in there along with heavy dosages of dill and onion powder....still bland.

Lacking in taste.  Would add more feta, some spinach, & a squeeze of lemon.

I made this in a hurry and totally forgot the dill and egg (the dill would have made it great), but it was very tasty and filling.  I made home-made tzatziki sauce to go with it - perfect compliment for this very light meal.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe, including my 10 month old!  I used potatoes, yellow squash, broccoli and mushrooms which I steamed in the microwave.  After steaming, I added a little balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing to the vegetables, along with the seasonings in the recipe.  Next time I think I would like to try artichoke hearts and kalamata olives!

This was delicious.  I might double the egg and the feta, and also add about 2 cups more vegetables, as mine was a little flat.  I used yellow squash, mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus (steamed all this) then added tomato before I cooked it.  I think potato would have given it some substance as well, and I might try that next time.

Real easy to make, used basil instead of dill because it's what I had. Turned out great, tasted like it was from a greek restuarant. I steamed red and green peppers and onion and to the egg mix I added scallions, olives, and tomato. Will definately make this dish again.

Great! I used potatoes, carrots, peas, and onions as my veggies (and of course, nix the onion powder if you add onions). Also, used freah dill instead of powdered. Remember to add more fresh herbs for the same taste as a concentrated powder!

This was good!  Used up a ton of leftover veggies I had and wasn't sure what to do with.  I used broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, carrots and celery.  I was a little confused on how the phyllo was supposed to go at the end.  I did what I thought was right and had a big spot in the middle with no phyllo, so I took four more sheets and just laid them over the top and tried to tuck them in as good as possible.  This turned out really good and I'm really glad I used the extra phyllo.  Yum!

Made this the other night with sweet potatoes, orange bell peppers, mushrooms, zucchini and onion. It was good! I lightly steamed the veggies but withheld the onion. Next time I will withhold the mushrooms from steaming, too. They were a little chewy in the finished product. I added fresh dill and it said "to taste" and I didn't add enough. I don't see the point of adding the one egg. I am thinking this recipe will be delicious with fresh tarragon instead of dill! Overall, I enjoyed this recipe and I can see how I can accommodate it to whatever my taste buds need. Thanks for helping me use up my Filo dough!

This has potential.  I made it as directed (with 1 tsp of salt and pepper) and I thought it was a little dry and slightly bland after baking. I tasted the veggie mixture before baking and thought it was wonderful.  I might add another egg white or something to add some moisture.  Or maybe I'll cover it during baking to keep in some of the moisture.

So yummy!!  My mom used to make something sort of like this, but didn't use cheese or egg.  The egg really held all the veggies together.  I didn't use any cheese.  I found some fun leftovers in the fridge to use though!  Some roasted chicken, spicy baked fries that I cubed, broccoli, corn and green beans.  It was GREAT!!

This was very tasty and easy.  I used frozen squash, bell peppers, fresh onions, and canned mushrooms.  I added a bottle of lite sweet vidila onion dressing to the vegetables.  Very yummy.
