This was so easy, moist and tasty!  My five year-old loved it!  I marinated the turkey for four hours and then grilled instead of broiling, but that was the only modification I made to the recipe.  I would definitely make again - especially for company!

This is great for a fat free meal.  I used 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning in place of rosemary and use turkey cutlets instead of tenderloins.  They cooked in 10 minutes (5 minutes each side).  Thanks for the flavorful, juicy, healthy meal idea.

This was so simple and it was great!! I used a lite soy sauce because I have high blood pressure and it is less sodium also used 2 tsp of salt free herb seasoning by mccormick with the tsp dijon mustard and 2 tsp of rosemary garlic seasoning because that is what I had in my kitchen. Marinated for 5 and 1/2 hours in fridge. Baked in the oven at 350 wrapped in foil for 45 mins and so tender OMG!!!

We just finished eating these turkey tenderloins and they were delicious. I served with "butternut squash with onions and pecans" (and dried cranberries) from this site, and we just loved everything. I only had half the amount of rosemary called for, so I added some poultry seasoning, which worked well. I marinated the tenderloins all day. Also, I followed the advice of the recipe and served it with cranberry chutney, also from this site. Yummmmmmm....

I tried this exactly as the recipe stated, and hated the marinade. Crazy salty, even though I used Kikkoman's lower sodium soy sauce. And the taste of soy was overpowering. I couldn't figure out how to salvage it, so I threw it out and did something entirely different with the tenderloins. So glad I tasted the marinade before putting it on the meat. This is one of those very rare times that I have a significant difference in opinion from the majority reviewers. I was counting on this recipe's working for me, b/c I was serving it to guests. Oh, well! Still glad I tried it.

I, too, was a little skeptical of soy sauce and turkey. This came out surprisingly good! I didn't want to broil because I've experienced dry and burned food with that method. So I marinated the turkey for 1 1/2 hours and used the stovetop method. First, I browned the turkey on both sides in olive oil, then added close to a cup of chicken stock along with some garlic and onion powders and black pepper. I covered the pan and let it gently simmer for about 17 min, turned the meat over and cooked another 17 min or so, adding a little more chicken stock, and just made sure the thermometer read 165degF. It produced a nice but thin sauce that you would never guess had soy sauce as an ingredient. It was rich and savory and worked well over the meat and some homemade stuffing. The meat also came out moist. This was a great way to prepare turkey breast tenderloin that I'll certainly use again! Thanks Christine!

This was an easy and delicious turkey recipe.  Surprisingly, this was a hit with my husband and me.  I say that because I had my doubts when I was reading the recipe but I tried it because of all the excellent reviews and they were right.   Based on other reviews the only change I made was to reduce the rosemary to 1 tsp and add 1 tsp of poultry seasoning.  I used a package of 1-1/4 lbs turkey tenderloins and marinated them overnight.  The turkey had a great flavor.  It did however take a few minutes longer to broil but it was definitely worth the wait.

Made it once per the recipe and enjoyed it. The second time I switched it up a bit. Rather than soy sauce, I use Liquid Aminos. I reduced the rosemary and added 1/2 tsp. of poultry seasoning, as well a minced clove of garlic, a dash of sherry and a dash of orange juice. I cooked the tenderloins in a grill pan. The result was delicious and had a bit more flavor for us.

Loved this! I changed my mind at the last minute about what to serve when having family over and needed a turkey tenderloin recipe RSVP. I used a little less rosemary and cooked it on the grill for a 30 minutes and it was a hit with all my guests (even the kids!), will definitely be making this healthy simple turkey dish on a regular basis!

WOW!  I cannot believe how easy and good this was!  It took 5 minutes to assemble and less than 15 to cook (convection oven) and my family (hubby, 10 yr old and 6 yr old)loved it--leaving nothing on their plates!  They said it was better and more tender than thanksgiving turkey.  I served it with homemade cranberry sauce and green beans. Thanks so much for a recipe that makes me look like a kitchen rockstar!

It was easy to make and the marinade was good, but it was a little too crispy in the broiler.  Next time, I would try baking it or even sauteeing instead.  Also, I would make more of the marinade to use as a gravy.

Amazingly delicious and easy.  I didn't have time to marinate, just spread the sauce over all sides of the turkey before cooking.  I was low on rosemary, so I also added some dried thyme.  Even better, I mixed up a box of stuffing mix and baked it in the same dish alongside the turkey for an almost-one-dish meal.   Winner of a dinner. :)

So good. I added about 2 tablespoons of Apple cider vinegar and 2 crushed garlic cloves. Also I used the poultry seasoning instead of rosemary. Baked it 325 for 50 mins turned them halfway thru. Covered for 15 mins with tin foil to rest delicious.

We grilled instead of broiling, and this turned out tasty and moist.  Admittedly, I had concerns about a soy sauce-based marinade on turkey, but it did not overwhelm the flavor.  I did boil the marinade and made a nice sauce with a cornstarch slurry.  Also, using reduced-sodium soy sauce resulted in a main course that broke down very well nutritionally.  Definitely will be making this again.

Just made this and it turned out perfectly! I purchased the turkey tenderloins that come in a plastic wrapper at Target and there were two pieces in there. I made the recipe without rosemary and added poultry seasoning, as many reviewers suggested. Marinated for 4 hours and then cooked in the broiler. Took about 25 minutes total (I turned once during cooking, putting my meat thermometer in at that time). Was a hit with my husband and father in law.

Made this yesterday evening and the flavor was awesome!  Definitely not too salty.  I would say the previous commenter hasn't tasted a brine either - very salty, but doesn't oversalt the brined meat.  This was wonderful.  I served it with sauteed kale and mashed potatoes.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I LOVE salt, but can't have it. If you're like me, use the lower sodium soy.  Had a really good flavor!

Excellent! Marinate longer than 1 hour. Overall it was quick and a much healthier way to cook.

With some customised modification to add aroma to this dish it turned out to be an excellent lunch meal. I used some Maggi sauce and Dijon mustard to marinate turkey slices in lime juice, rosemary, ginger, salt and pepper. Braised sliced carrots and chopped paprika in a bit of goose fat before adding marinated turkey and (1 min before serving) some chopped green onion. This goes on a bed of wild/black rice, along with some boiled sweet potatoes and sliced fresh veg (like Kohlrabi for instance). Bon appetit!

Yum! Quick and simple recipe! I used low-sodium soy sauce and it was still a bit salty, so be warned. I took the advice of other reviewers and used a couple teaspoons of poultry seasoning, and a teaspoon of rosemary. Will make again!

The whole family ate this including 3 meat-hating children!  So easy, healthy and fast.  I only had an hour to marinate and there was plenty of flavor.  I used turkey breast "filets" - thicker than what I would consider a cutlet but not what I would consider a tenderloin.  There were 3 filets in my 1.25 lb package.  I broiled for 7 minutes on each side which was perfect.  I also used poultry seasoning rather than rosemary since rosemary can be so strong.  This one is a keeper for our family!

Wonderful! I used 3 TBL fresh rosemary from my herb garden. I marinated for about 1.5 hours and then we grilled them. Moist and flavorful. Definitely a keeper!

I wish i had marinated longer than an hour. This was delicious.  I added a bay leaf to the marinade. I wish I had added sour orange juice cause it would have been extra tender and yummy. Looked beautiful!  Very tasty.

This was a great, quick way to cook turkey tenderloins but having it 4 inches from the broiler was not far enough --they almost burned!  So I lowered the rack and turned them more than once.  It also took less than 20 minutes to cook so, when you try this recipe, be sure to watch them while they cook. The flavor was fantastic -- we served it with whole cranberry sauce and it was a great combination.

Thank you for such a wonderful recipe, my entire family enjoyed it immensely. Benefiting from other comments, I reduce the Soy Sauce down to a ½ Tbls, reducing the salt intake. I also added 1 Tbls. Apple Cider Vinegar and Brown Sugar, as well as 2 Tbls of Worcestershire Sauce!

Made this as is, with the exception of marinating time.  We only let it sit for about 20 minutes in the marinade and it was still wonderful.  Very flavorful and easy to make.  The kids all had seconds.  Will be keeping this one in my recipe box for a long time!

Very easy, and delicious! I marinated my tenderloin in buttermilk, then rubbed it with cayanne pepper seasoning, and it turned out moist, and also great for sandwiches the next day.

This recipe was delicious, very easy and great for those of us under time constraints to create a healthy dinner.  My 6 year old who is very picky really liked it and commented that this is his second favorite entree. (Mac-n-cheese is his first.)

I skipped the rosemary since I am not a fan of that herb. Marinated 4 hours then dumped meat & sauce & 1/2 c. poultry broth (turkey or chicken) into pan.  Sprinkled with garlic powder & roasted at 350 for 50 mins (turning roast at 25 minutes & adding more broth as needed to keep the pan from drying out). Let rest 10 minutes. Served with oven roasted squash & mashed potatoes. Scrumptious.

Quite tasty but next time I'll try baking because my broiler made the outside too crispy before the inside was cooked through. If you're broiling, check it frequently! Still enjoyed it and the inside was still fairly moist in spite of the challenges. Will definitely make again.

This is a magical recipe. It was my first time cooking turkey breast tenderloins and I expected it to be difficult to keep them flavorful and juicy. Somehow this super simple marinade resulted in perfect tenderloins. As others have said it is pretty salty, which suited our tastes but might be too much for some. Definitely try this recipe!

I doubled the recipe for 1.5 lbs (2 turkey tenderloins). Used poultry seasoning in place of only rosemary. Marinated 6 hrs in fridge until dinnertime. Easy and delicious! I made the cranberry chutney the author mentions, and it was an excellent complement.

Made it last night.  Used honey mustard instead of Dijon because it was all I had.  Easy, tender, delish.  Even my husband, who doesn't eat much meat, asked for more.  Will make again.

Excellent/ I think marinating it goes a long way in making it good. I need low sodium for my mom so I don't salt anything and used lemon juice instead of soy sauce for that reason. Also added 1/2 teaspoon sage, and 1 teaspoon oregano in this. I baked it 400 30 minutes covered and it was so tender didn't need a knife to cut it, Will make often.

This was delicious!  I added a little bit of glazed balsamic vinegar and substituted fresh rosemary.  Perfect with my homemade cranberry preserve.  Served it with squash/onion casserole. Yummy!

Excellent recipe.  I made it with the marinade recipe listed, but used a 1lb turkey tenderloin.  I hammered it a few times with my tenderizer on both sides as I only had about 45 minutes to let it soak in the marinade.  Also I cooked it on the barbeque grill.  It was so moist and tasty and I will be making this again!

Delicious way to prepare a small turkey tenderloin.  I did use low sodium soy sauce in place of regular soy sauce.  The meat marinated all day, as I mixed it up in the morning and we had it for dinner. Since it was a nice evening, we chose to grill it rather than broil.  Wonderful flavor, and I would use it again.  Served it with steamed broccoli and baked mac n' cheese.

This recipe was easy to prepare and exceptionally tasty. I did change it a liitle. I added 3 T. of canola oil to reduced sodium soy sauce and dijon mustard for the marinade. I also added some salt free garlic and herb seasoning instead of the rosemary. I marinated the meat for about one hour.  I had to cook the meat slightly longer than called for, about 24 minutes. The result was moist and savory.

This was very good! I'm not a "thanksgiving type" turkey fan. This was flavorful, and broiling on high gave it a bit of a crisp. I cut the rosemary in half, even tho I love it, and used poultry seasoning as suggested. It was great! Will try the chutney next time. I imagine that would make it superb!

I grilled these - was surprised how moist they ended up being for a no-oil recipe.  Made them with Sweet and Spicy Sweet Potatoes, cooked in foil packets on the same grill.  They were perfectly cooked at the same time the meat was done.  Make sure to pull the meat off the grill a bit early, as the tenderloins will continue to cook as they rest.  Excellent change to the BBQ routine!

This is awesome! My husband told me I can add this to the regular dinner schedule, which means it was a huge success! It is like Thanksgiving but with A LOT less time and just as much flavor. I used fresh thyme, sage and rosemary so the flavor really popped! I also substituted coconut aminos for soy sauce (paleo-friendly)and added about a Tbsp olive oil to the marinade. It only took 16 minutes in my oven, and it came out juicy and flavorful. Will be making this again soon!

I used thighs instead of tenderloins, covered in olive oil, broiled until browned and baked until ready :) The ingredients are out of this world.

Substituted cutlets for tenderloins and poultry seasoning for rosemary. Marinated in the fridge for 6 hours. Bad weather, so grilled on the George Forman. Very good flavor. Will try with the rosemary and outdoor grill in future. A keeper!

A little salty even w/low salt soy sauce, but good flavor. The tenderloins I used were small, so I cooked them a bit less, to avoid dry turkey

Really enjoyed this dish but watch the cooking time.  It took far less time than in the recipe, in our broiler.  I will turn them at about 7/8 mins. next time.

Entire family loved it.  We grilled the tenderloins and served with brown rice and green beans w/almonds.  My daughter suggested trying this with chicken breasts.  Quick, easy and virtually no clean up.  Perfect for a busy week night.

Has anyone had experience with the odor that fresh turkey tenderloins have?  I use Butterball.  Either fresh or if I've frozen them for couple of weeks and then use, when I open them, they have a peculiar odor.  When I cook/grill them, they are fine.  Just a strange odor.

Great recipe. The soy sauce gave a different flavor for Turkey. It was delicious and flavorful, not to mention easy!

Really quite good, although next time I think I'll use low sodium soy sauce - it was a little bit salty.  I purchased a turkey tenderloin, sliced it and grilled it after the marinade.  I used fresh rosemary from the garden.  Very tender and moist!

I love salt, but this did taste a bit too salty for me. Also, the rosemary overwhelmed the meat. I would reduce the rosemary in half if I were to make this again.

My husband grimaced when I said we were having turkey breast tenderloins for dinner. "They're so bland." So I looked for a recipe that would have lots of flavor. This was a winner! Super easy, too. I did not have enough rosemary, so used half poultry seasoning as some suggested. I asked him if the recipe was a "keeper". It is!!

This is a very simple but good recipe. 

I've made it 3 times now with excellent results every time. 

I use low sodium soy sauce and substituted honey mustard instead of what it called for since that's what I had on hand.

I also added one T of olive oil.

I usually don't use marinades because I run out of time, but thought I could use this one for an hour.  Delicious!!!  My family loved it!  I followed someone's review and baked them in foil for 40 minutes (I cut the tenderloin in thick strips because they were frozen), then I opened the foil and broiled then for 20 more minutes, flipping them in the juices a few times kept them from drying out.  Super tender and moist.  Leftovers made great sandwiches the next day.

I used low sodium soy sauce and the finished dish was salty. My husband thought so too. Other than that, it had a decent flavor. I wouldn't make it again though.

So simple and flavorful!! I doubled the marinade and let it sit for 24 hours. Then my husband grilled the tenderloins. 7 minutes on high for one side, then flipped and turned the heat down to medium (specifically "MOM" medium-off-medium with our three burners) for 7 minutes. The turkey turned out perfect. Super tender and delicious!!

This is a wonderful, tangy marinade and perfect for turkey tenderloins.  I made it as described but did not have time to let it marinade.  A couple times during cooking, I turned the turkey and added more sauce.  Great!

I was a little heavy handed with the Dijon mustard and I marinated for closer to 5 hours  but my husband and I both enjoyed this.  I am not a great cook and thought it was relatively easy and actually had the ingredients (except the turkey) on hand.

I made this tonight and used low sodium soy sauce, dijon mustard and poultry seasoning as other suggested and my husband loved it! He had his reservations about the turkey to begin with but this is a keeper.  We are very picky about salty foods and this def was not too salty.  I placed on a rack with cookie sheet and broiled it for 20 minutes on the rack second from the top.  Served with rosemary quinoa and black-eyed peas for the new year.  Will def make again!!

The turkey breast tenderloin turned out looking very dry on the outside, but it turned out it was actually  very moist, tender, &  had good flavor. It was mildly on the salty side to me & my boyfriend, even though I used low sodium soy sauce, but not overpoweringly so. I mixed the soy sauce & Dijon mustard together & coated the breasts in it in a Rubbermaid container, then I coated one side of it w/the fist tsp. of poultry seasoning & turned it over to add the 2nd (I used the 2 tsp. poultry seasoning instead of the Rosemary). I then put it in the fridge for 4-5 hours  to marinade while I ran errands. I broiled it on the normal setting.  It was very easy & I would have to say I'd definitely make this again.

My family and I really liked it! It was easy, moist, full of flavor and healthy.  I followed the recipe, but I grilled it instead of broiling and marinated the tenderloin for only 1 1/2 hours. I served it with grilled onions and yellow & orange peppers upon quinoa. Very nice! First time I ever cooked turkey tenderloin and it was a hit. Thanks!

Super easy recipe and please disregard the few that hated it! A 3 ingredient marinade and no prep, plus done in 20 minutes, you cant't beat it! Perhaps they had a smaller cut of meat or too much sauce to meat ratio? One poster said they tasted the sauce before putting on the meat, which I wouldn't recommend, of course it will be salty! You might want to look at sodium content before you mix. I used reduced sodium Tamari instead of regular soy sauce, which has more sodium but an overall less salty taste, I also used stone ground mustard which has a little less sodium, instead of Dijon. I had a 1.69 package of turkey breast tenderloin, 2 large pieces of turkey breast and cooked them for about 24 minutes total. I increased all ingredients by about 1/4 since I had more meat than the recipe called for. The taste was wonderful and I am not one to add salt to my food, in fact, I tend to undersalt my recipes, so I'm certainly not a fan of super salty foods! This was a great recipe, great flavor and very easy! Try it!

I was excited to try this recipe because of all the positive reviews, but it was a let-down for me.  I made it exactly as written, but the soy overpowered everything and was extremely salty.  I'll be looking for a different recipe for turkey tenderloin.

Delicious way to prepare a small turkey tenderloin. I did use low sodium soy sauce in place of regular soy sauce. The meat marinated all day, as I mixed it up in the morning and we had it for dinner. Since it was a nice evening, we chose to grill it rather than broil. Wonderful flavor, and I would use it again. Served it with steamed broccoli and baked mac n' cheese.

Very easy and full of flavor. Not the least bit dried out. We cooked ours for 25 minutes.

This was very tasty. We grilled the tenderloins instead of using the broiler. They were moist and flavorful and it could easily pass for pork tenderloin!

This recipe was very easy and my husband loved it!  I used one cup of plain yellow mustard mixed with the soy sauce and rosemary.  I let the two turkey breasts/tenderloins marinate in a baggy in the fridge for 3 hours. Broiled it for 22 minutes..flipping 10 minutes in.  Really delicious and easy!

My family love it. Oven roasting keeps it juicier than grilling, And I sometimes use ginger soy sauce for extra flavor.

This was extremely humdrum. Not bad, not great. We ate it, but it would've been better either made with chicken or with a lot more seasoning. Thanks for sharing!

I am adding this recipe to our extended family Christmas dinner plan for next year.  I broiled these for 10 min on each side at the lower heat broiler setting and they came out perfect.  Topped with Spiced Cranberry Apple Chutney (also found in Allrecipes) it was scrumptious, but I think the rosemary mustard marinade made it interesting enough to stand alone for those that don't want to top it with Chutney. This is not a time consuming recipe, which is important when making multiple dishes for a large crowd.

This is super simple and tasty.  My marinade included 1/2 c of white wine and 1c water. 
Instead of the oven, I cooked it in a cast iron deep skillet with browned mushrooms and onions and 1/2 c chicken stock for 30 min.
Served with broccoli florets and sliced purple potatoes.

Super easy and Super good! Didn't have time for a long marinade - only 30 minutes. Still had lots of flavor. Also didn't have the rosemary crushed (or feel like crushing it) so I used a generous pinch of regular dried rosemary. Cooking time was on the mark but I put the pan a bit more than 4 inches away and had it set to low broil. Seemed to give it a bit of a crisp on the outside and the meat was so moist.  Didn't have cranberry chutney but I did have a bag of whole cranberries. viola - cranberry sauce. Never thought of broiling the turkey tenderlion, so glad ! found this recipe! my Even my pickiest kiddo liked it.

this was gorgeous. I only marinated it for 30 mins and it was plenty. I used Breast fillets and used chicken seasoning instead of the rosemary . even my fussy 2 year old ate this and wanted more.

Make sure you like the flavor of rosemary before using it in the marinade. My family didn't care for it. Also the cooking time was too long, the meat was very dry. If I make it again, I will skip the rosemary and maybe use garlic, and only cook for about 5 minutes on each side.

I marinated these for about 6 hours and the only change I made was to add some minced garlic to the marinade.  This is what we had instead of the usual turkey for Thanksgiving.  Served with a side of fried rice - this was great for dinner.  So quick to cook and was very tender, moist, and flavorful.

Really great, easy recipe.  I've made it with and without the rosemary and we like it both ways.  Next time I will try poultry seasoning as one viewer suggested.  I make these tenderloins on the weekend and my husband likes using them during the week for his lunches.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Big hit with family of 5.  Used turkey london broil (1-3/4lb) instead and cooked approx. 15 mins longer.  Skipped rosemary and opted for poultry seasoning as suggested by others.  Leftovers were used on salad for lunch the next day.

I am not a fan of mustard so I was a bit skeptical in that it was one of only 3 ingredients for the marinade.  But this was pretty good!  I marinated the turkey overnight.  The rosemary came across really strong, so I might try it again with a different spice.  You cannot beat the simplicity of this recipe.

Surprisingly good! Marinated for almost six hours and then grilled. The only thing I will probably change next time is to split the tenderloin so more meat is exposed to the great marinade!

I was only able to marinate the turkey for about 45 minutes but it still had good flavor.  Only needed about 18 minutes cooking time - either my tenderloins were small or my broiler cooks fast.  We all liked this!

I used turkey breast cutlets for this recipe.  It was fabulously easy and delicious!  I typically dislike rosemary, but it was very good combined w/ the soy sauce and dijon (both of which I love). Next time I will not leave the kitchen when broiling b/c it only needed to cook about half the time the recipe calls for. Also, I only marinated for one hour but the flavors were still very nice. Thanks so much for this tasty, low-fat recipe! I will definitely be making this regularly.

It was a big hit with the family. I used thin cut turkey breasts.

I have never been big on turkey or rosemary but this EXTREMELY simple dish was so good I make it regularly now. It is a great, healthy, quick, tasty dinner. Thanks

Very simple yet flavorful marinade. I used this on a turkey cutlet, and will definitely make it again. The soy sauce helped keep the meat moist and tender.

I thought this turkey turned out great! Tender and Yummy! I'm not a huge fan of mustard so I was very nervous about putting it in. But I really enjoyed the flavor of this turkey!

Fabulous.  I used this on a Turkey Breast roast and it turned out moist and juicy and perfectly seasoned.  I got rave reviews from my guests.
