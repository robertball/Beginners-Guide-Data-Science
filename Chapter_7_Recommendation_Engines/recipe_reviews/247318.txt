This was a good starting place.  I substituted ground chicken (sorry Jeanie), used sesame oil with a couple of shakes of cayenne for cooking the chicken and added a dollop of oyster sauce when adding the pepper.   Garnished with matchstick carrots.  Very good.

Pretty good, but I would add tomatoes and maybe cilantro.

This recipe is delicious, the whole family loves it, even my picky 3 year old.  I felt there was something missing though and added some oyster sauce.  It also could do with a little heat, since I'm cooking it for my kids I just put hot sauce on my own, but it would be delicious with jalape√±o.
