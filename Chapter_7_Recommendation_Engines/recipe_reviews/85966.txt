This is a wonderfully flavorful rice dish. I modified it just a bit. I used Garcia's Beef Sausage left over chicken and long-grain white rice. While I cooked the rice (2 cups white long grain rice), I sauteed the sausage in a small saute pan. Meanwhile,  I sauteed onion and pepper in a large sautepan until tender. Then added remaining ingredients except the tomatoes in one pan and simmered. I added the tomatoes in the last 5 minutes. When rice was done, I stirred in the rice. Very enjoyable rice dish! And the leftovers make a great fried rice!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I doubled the recipe and used hot italian sausage.  I also used petit cut canned tomatoes.  I did not have frozen peas in the house, so I substituted frozen chopped spinach which my kids like more.  Good recipe.

I don't know if I would call this spanish but I would call it delicious.  We really enjoyed this.  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh as other suggested. Other then that followed recipe exactly.  Just great.

I used sun-dried tomato & chicken sausage I had on hand. It added lots of flavor. I added a few cloves of chopped garlic, salt & pepper when cooking the onion/chicken mixture. Then I used jasmine rice. When rice was cooked I added a can of drained diced tomatoes. This dinner had lots of flaver & was quick and easy for a weeknight. It was a hit w/ the kids and hubby. Thanks!

oh this was delish!  i changed a few things after reading the reviews and looking at the recipe... i added another 2/3 cup of water and bouillon mixture and a small can of tomato paste instead of the tomatoes (the little one doesn't like chunks!) i'm glad for the extra liquid, i think it really needed it.  i didnt have any peas so i used corn and i think i would prefer the corn. i added some cumin to give it a little more of a spanish flavor.  i used lean turkey italian sausage, removed the casings, and cooked 3 links in the pan until browned before slicing and returning to the skillet.  i hate when the casings get gummy or chewy - yuk! all in all i thought this was great: quick and easy, one pan, good flavor, and if you lighten up the sausage it's not all that bad for you either!!

The dish was ok, but use either homemade chicken broth or a good brand of canned chicken broth in place of the MSG and salt loaded boullion and water. I believe it needs some hot pepper flakes or dash of hot sauce to perk it up. The Italian sausage isn't enough to carry the dish. I would also use more tomatoes, fresh if you have them, but a good quality canned diced would be fine.

This was pretty good, but not great.  I used a 14.5 oz. can of Italian style diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and, by personal preference, left out the green peppers.  I also added some garlic salt at the end.

Good idea in theory. In practice I felt some changes would better suite my family. We went more for a southwest flare. I substitute Jalapeno Sausage for the SI. Substitute sweet corn for the peas. Add a little cilantro and paprika instead of thyme. I also highly recommend using stock instead of bullion. A little splash of pepper jack or cheddar when it hits the table made the kids excited.

Yeah, not too sure what makes this "Spanish" but it was pretty good. I made it with jalapeno/chicken sausage instead of chicken, and wish I'd thrown some shrimp in too. I added another couple of tomatoes as mine were a little bit small. Husband thought it was a little bit bland so he sprinkled on some red pepper flakes. Anyway, this was a decent meal. Thanks!

Had put a couple chicken breasts in Italian dressing to marinate for grilling just before spotting this recipe. Had a half pound of bulk Italian sausage that I needed to use up. Browned and crumbled the sausage. Shook marinate off the chicken and cut into half inch strips. Picked fresh peppers (just a tad hot) that I cut in rings and tomatoes. Yes, broth would be better than bouillon but didn't have any and the bouillon came out fine. Used basmati rice that has been well rinsed and soaked about 10 minutes before adding, brought to boil then removed from heat and let it sit for about 20 minutes covered. Added tomatoes right at the end. Nice dinner. Next time I might add a little dried Italian seasoning.

Soooo good! I made it exactly as written, with the exception of using low sodium chicken broth instead of the water and boullion, and I used ground hot sausage. Very flavorful and so easy to make!

Very tasty. I left out the olive oil and used one can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I also used regular rice which I cooked separately and then mixed in at the end, so I didn't need the bouillon or water. Will definitely make again.

This was really yummy. I had to cook it a little longer because I used brown instant rice instead of the white. I also doubled the veggies and omitted the extra salt (bouillon is salty enough). This is something I'll definitely make again.

A hit with the family.  Tastes a lot like jambalaya.  Had to substitute for ingrediants on hand: used hot instead of sweet sausage, eggplant instead of peas (adding with onion), canned tomatoes instead of fresh (added juice as well), brown rice that I cooked separately (used about 1 cup of chicken broth in dish, added rice at end and let it sit in pan for about 10 minutes).  Very good and easy.

It was okay. I ended up adding smoked paprika for flavor and my husband put some shredded Cheddar on top at the table and that helped a lot.

Let me start by saying this isn't my idea of Spanish Style Rice. Having said that, it was still a good dish. I omitted the green peppers, used brown rice and substituted a can of Rotel for the tomatoes.

Very tasty!  I made a few modifications....Instead of frozen peas I used frozen mixed veggies.  Also, I changed the amount of veggies to 1 1/2 cups.  Last, I used Spicy Italian Turkey Sausage.  The spicy sausage really gave the dish some extra flavor and zing!  Will definitely make again!

Can't review correctly because i altered the recipe, but the way i made it i thought it was really good.  I took some of the other member reviews and merged them together...here was the method....  i omitted the chicken altogether and used 1/2 lb of mexican chorizo and 1/2 lb of sweet it. sausage i browned these together then added the onions and gr. peppers(about a half of each)  and small bunch of cilantro.  sauteed til tender, added canned chix broth and peas. Simmer 5 minutes, then added the rice and canned italian diced tomatoes.  simmered 5 minutes; covered and let stand 5 minutes.  i thought it was excellent, along with my 2 yr old and husband.  not too spicy cuz of the mix of sausages.

This was so tasty.  The only change I made was to down size the recipe for feeding two. Usually when I try a new recipe it is met with some skepticism by hubby.  This one he ate up full speed ahead and went back for seconds.  I will definately try this for a large group now that it's on the "approved" list.

I was all over the place with this one and it STILL turned out great. I had a full pound of sausage so decided to stretch the dish. I liked the idea of using chicken so went with that also. Using extra meat made me nervous about how much broth would be to cook the rice. Being unfamiliar with instant rice, I decided to cook my rice separately. Which left the meat mixture very wet so when my rice was done, I added the cooked rice to the meat mixture and cooked down the broth for a cpl minutes. Yummy! Definitely making this again. My family loved it!

We loved this! I did make a couple of changes because I didn't have all the ingredients but it was delicious. I used one can of chicken broth instead of the bouillon cubes and water and I used one can of diced tomato instead of the fresh tomatoes. I also didn't use peas. We'll definitely reuse this recipe.

This was okay. It was a little bland. I added some extra salt and some pepper and it helped a little but I feel like it was missing something. Maybe a different sausage, or more sausage would help?

This was an easy and fairly tasty recipe.  The only thing I didn't have on hand was the sweet italian sausage.  I used some Polska Keilbasa and it turned out fine.  (Or at least we thought so.  I'm sure the taste was a little different than if I had used the sweet sausage.)  Don't know if I will make again just because there are other things we like better.  But overall it was a nice recipe.

This was a very hearty supper. I did add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes after reading other reviews. I also added about 2 cups of organic portabella mushroom soup simply because I had some left over in the fridge. It added great flavor, I would add it again. It did make it more like a casserole or hot dish though.

This is a nice tasting recipe.  It also helps that its quick and easy to fix.  I pretty much followed the directions exact except I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of using fresh ones.  I also used a garlic italian flavored sausage which gave a little extra garlicky taste.  I will make this again in the future.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good! The only thing I changed was I used a can of Italian style tomatoes instead of fresh and chicken broth instead of the bouillon. The fam loved it and it heats up great as leftovers the next day.

This is like cheater's paella! The only change I made was to use regular long grain rice that I cooked separately because I don't care for instant. We really liked this, and it made a TON of leftovers. Big fan.

I didn't notice until the last minute that it called for instant rice so like others before me I precooked the rice, sausage and chicken.  I used thighs and poached it in broth (boxed).  Next time I will cook the rice in broth and the liquid from the canned tomatoes.  My bell pepper was red, and I prefer that.  I used mixed frozen vegetables, next time I will use frozen peas just to check it out!  It smells heavenly!

This was just OK.  My husband liked it.  If I make it again, I will use less Thyme and add more Garlic Powder.  I would also use spicy sausage to add some spice!

Great recipe - even my kids liked it! My son came up with the idea to serve it on tortillas, and it was delicious. I doubled up on the meat, used canned chicken broth, and spiced it up by using Rotel tomatoes and green chilies instead of fresh tomatoes. This is a keeper!

This recipe knocked my husband's socks off - it's his new favorite dinner. I used chicken sausage instead of regular. It was pretty easy to make which I love. I'll defintely make it again.

Very bland. I added lots of paprika and chilli powder, which helped a little. Perhaps (Spanish) chorizo would help.

Very good, I used canned sweet peas, omitted the green bellpepper and I added a little gumbo file to give it that extra flavor (Delish). It was a quick and easy meal...will make again

This is a really good recipe. We loved it. I made a few changes. I added a couple cloves of garlic and I used can diced tomatoes. Be careful with the tomatoes, I use a cup of water and 2/3 juice from the tomatoes. All I can say it was really good.

Very good recipe. Made no changes other than putting more spice in that it called for. Even so, the Italian sausage offered up by far the most taste in the dish. Only change would be to triple the amount of spices called for by the recipe.

I like this a lot.  I think it lacks a little kick, though.  But just some red and black pepper goes a long way.
