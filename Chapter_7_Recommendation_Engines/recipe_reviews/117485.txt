Really good!! Easy and lower in carb and calories than potato's. Plus you can substitute butter etc...Quick hint: It's easier/better to boil the cauliflower until tender, then put it in a baking dish and add butter, cheese, salt/pepper and breadcrumbs and bake for about 15-20 minutes at 350. Add a little cream, sour cream or milk if the cheese gets too stringy.

we have been eating Cauliflower with cheese sauce for years, and hubby likes this much better!
I cooked the cauliflower in the microwave 3 minutes, added the bread crumbs  butter and shredded mozzarella cheese, and topped it up with a bit of milk to thin - excellent! Will definitely make again!

It was okay...it seems like it needs to baked though.  It was good, but dry - it needs something mixed in with the cauliflower to make it a little saucy...like Au Gratin potatoes...

Overcooked cauliflower, too much butter in the topping, needs a pinch of salt, should go under the broiler. Disappointing. :0(

This wasnt a success.  The parmesan chees melted to the  pan (and I did follow instructions and remove pan from heat before adding parmesan to breadcrumbs) and became a coagulated mess.  The 'mess' then could not be distributed over the cauliflower evenly.  Im not even sure this would come under the 'au gratin' section to be honest.

I did not find this bland as other reviewers did.  In fact, I found it just the opposite - it had almost too much flavor.  I liked this, but I think some people might find the parmesan a little bit overpowering.  Cutting the parmesan in half might help.
