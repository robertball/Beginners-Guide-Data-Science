I have tried many waffle recipes in my life and I am 74 years old.  These waffles are the best.  They are light, crispy and taste great.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I love it that I can use my sourdough starter that I keep in my refrigerator.

Everyone loved the waffles went for seconds.  Woke up my century old San Francisco sour dough Wednesday, fed it and got it going, Sunday morning early I mixed in about 200 grams of very happy starter into 108F filtered water with a teaspoon of sugar, stirred it all up and incorporated the flour.  I let the batter sit for a few hours and when it was going off I finished the recipe exactly as called out.  We used a Belgian style griddle and came out with fantastic, light , crispy, chewy, sour deliciousness.  Unsalted sweet butter, Canadian maple syrup and macerated strawberries topped these golden beauties. Splendid, yeah I'll do this recipe again and again.

These were great. I love how crispy the waffles turned out. To make these apple cinnamon flavored, I added a tablespoon of boiled apple cider and a teaspoon of cinnamon.

These waffles were delicious! I made the following changes: 1) I didn't plan ahead enough to allow the sourdough to activate overnight. Instead, I just used more starter than the recipe called for and cut back on the flour and water accordingly. I don't think I got the batter as thick as it should have been, and although the flavor was great, I think I'll try to follow the recipe in this respect next time in hopes of taller waffles. 2) I replaced the veggie oil with coconut oil... just personal preference. 

I served these with maple syrup and fresh strawberries... overall a delicious treat for a Sunday morning.

I struggle with left over sourdough starter and this was a perfect recipe.  I don't usually leave the mix overnight, I mix everything on the spot, just with more sourdough starter and very crispy and tasty waffles!  I kept some frozen and defrosted in the toaster and they were just as freshly made ones! Definitely I will be making more!

I reduced the amount of oil to about 1/3 cup and the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. The waffles came out crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. Waffle perfection! This is a keeper recipe!

These were fabulous.  So light and fluffy.  We doubled it for my family of 7 and they were gone in a flash with frequent requests for more.

I added one extra Tablespoon sugar and only one teaspoon of salt. These were very good and a great way to use extra starter. I had way more starter than one cup so I had to adjust the dry ingredients a little at the end just adding a little extra dry. I will make them again.

2 tsp salt is way too salty and I'm usually one that adds extra salt to recipes. These were so salty the first time around, no one could eat them. 1/2 tsp is perfect. Once the adjustment was made, everyone who has these loves them and usually walks away with the recipe.

Delicious and easy. The recipe is forgiving in that I weighed the starter (approx. 250g/C for me after stirring out the CO2 bubbles). Accurate? Not sure, but it worked! I then decided to increase the recipe yield by 1/4 without adding more starter. I let it sit for 5 hours and it was just fine. The only suggestion I have for fluffy Belgian waffles is to beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold them in. Mix the yolks in as the recipe directs for whole eggs.

These waffles are awesome!! I always let the batter sit overnight or it doesnâ€™t work properly for me and I have a Belgian waffle iron so I only get 4/5 waffles per batch. (The waffle iron I have takes a full cup of batter per waffle.) I have doubled the recipe and freeze the extra batch for waffles during the week. They reheat perfectly in the toaster oven!!  Thank you!!

These are my go -to waffles! I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. They come out perfect each time. I usually make the sponge the night before. These waffles also stay pretty fresh for days after in the fridge if you're cooking for 1 or 2.  I just pop one in the oven for a little reheat and they're great! Thanks for a great recipe!

I actually prefer to have it more fully broken down. I'll mix equal parts water and equal parts flour to add it to my starter until it has had a chance to fully autolyse. (about 24 hours before we eat it). 

Then I just finish the recipe. The kids love it and the adults of the house really appreciate it.

This recipe is sooooo light and airy and delicious.  I made both waffles and pancakes from the batter.  The pancakes are also light and airy but cooked up somewhat thinner than most pancakes.  They were still delicious and there were none left.

The perfect waffle. Iâ€™ve made this exactly as the recipe suggests (my go-to), and with several modifications. I came across it looking to use up my discard starter, and itâ€™s great. That said, donâ€™t let the sourdough part stop you from trying it - you can sub in more flour and water and itâ€™ll still come out great. Second, and related - 4 hours to overnight is a suggestion. Again, theyâ€™ll then out great on short notice, and if you like a more sour flavor, it gets more intense with longer fermentation (Iâ€™ve gone up to three days). Also, the baking soda and water donâ€™t need to be pre-mixed, itâ€™s fine either way. Iâ€™ve also made these as pancakes (delicious), and added banana (perfect), and Nutella (my wifeâ€™s favorite). Iâ€™ve also cooked a vegan version, subbing 1 tsp baking soda and 1 Tbsp white vinegar (or lemon juice) for each egg - again, fantastic. This is an unbelievably resilient batter base, and I canâ€™t recommend it enough. Give it a try the original way, then make it yours. You wonâ€™t be disappointed!

My go to recipe for waffles and pancakes.  These are crisp waffles, light fluffy pancakes.  I add half whole wheat flour and they are still great.

DELICIOUS. Golden, fluffy, lightly crispy on the outside ... Thank you for this! My sourdough starter is thicker than waffle batter, so I compensated by adding extra water, just to a pourable state. Easy peasy. Tossed some frozen blueberries onto a couple of waffles after pouring into hot iron. Again, perfection.

Great recipe. It came out very light for me and the batter almost too thin for a waffle, with a lovely crispness.  Almost lacy. I might thicken the batter a little next time. Also I realized I was out of veggie oil and so used a combination of peanut and coconut oils and added some butter. Had a great flavor!

The batter was so thick we were skeptical that we would end up with an acceptable waffle.  Wow, were we surprised.  These were so light and crispy and just, downright delicious.  Will definitely become a weekend staple at our house.

Delicious. The batter is a bit thick and goopy so I wasn't sure if I did it right. But it came out perfectly cakey and golden. I added some vanilla sugar in second half of the batch to make it sweeter.

Great recipe.  I did the initial "wake-up" overnight, and I cut the salt in half, since it was way more than my other batter recipe.  Very good as waffles or pancakes.

Very flavorful waffles! I ate one with just butter while I was making the rest. Tasted like sourdough bread! So Good! I cut the salt and sugar in half and used half white flour and half einkorn flour. Will definitely make this again!

I made it as pancakes (I don't have a waffle iron) and it was amazing! Thank you for this recipe!

I didnâ€™t change a thing with this recipe.  So glad I didnâ€™t because these were the best waffles I have ever made or eaten!

EXCELLENT recipe! I used only 1/4 cup oil and omitted the baking soda solution and they were perfect amd exactly as described: crispy on the outside with a chewy thickness inside. They reheated beautifully in the toaster oven. We will be adding these to our breakfast-for-dinner menu for sure!

These are a staple in our house, at least every other weekend the mother starter gets used for these delicious waffles. They are perfectly crispy. We use 1/4 cup oil. Make it, you wonâ€™t be disappointed.

Delicious! 
We have tried other sourdough waffle recipes. Some called for buttermilk. They were horrible. 
But, the waffles made from this recipe were light, crispy, browned wonderfully, and most importantly tasted terrific! These will be a staple in our household!

5 stars for what it is - a sourdough waffle. I prefer the flavor of a regular waffle (i.e., not sour), but right now, fermented wheat is the only wheat I can digest. This recipe allows me to eat waffles, an otherwise forbidden food for me. And the texture of these waffles is good. The baking soda leavens marvelously; be sure to have extra room in your bowl before you add it! Being sourdough, these waffles are more savory than sweet. I didn't think they were as good with butter and strawberries as regular waffles. But I'd like to try another reviewer's idea to make them apple cinnamon flavored. I expect they'd also be good with a fried egg and a creamy sauce on top. (Or as a Chicken and Waffles dish!) They're just not as dessert-like as a regular waffle, so expect that difference and you're good to go!
