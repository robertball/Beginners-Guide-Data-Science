This cranberry sauce is fresh and way better than the stuff out of the can.  Everyone always raves about it at dinner parties!

I left the cinnamon stick out of this recipe but otherwise followed the directions.  I really liked the addition of prunes to this one!  This will be one of two recipes that I'll put on my Thanksgiving table!  Thanks, Swest!

New twist to the plain old standard! I had to use strawberry preserves because we always have it in the fridge. Turned out great!

Nice balance between very tart and perfectly sweet. Love this recipe. I added a little extra powdered cinnamon and a pinch of clove but otherwise, I wouldn't touch this near perfect sauce.

I've been making this recipe for at least 15 years.  It came from Good Housekeeping magazine and is a family favorite
