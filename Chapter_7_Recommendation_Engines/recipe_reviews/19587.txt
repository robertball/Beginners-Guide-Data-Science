OK, I am going to try this tomorrow for breakfast, but I wanted to say, quinoa has an acidic coating on it naturally.  This must be rinsed off, or the quinoa will have a bitter taste.  I suggesst soaking or rinsing the quinoa for about 15 minutes before using.  If you soak the grain, then you can simply rinse well before cooking.  I think this is probably the problem and not the apple juice.

Easy to make, yummy and you can play with it -- use soy or rice milk for the apple juice, throw in nuts (once cooked or else they get soft), dried or cut-up fresh fruit...  Quinoa looks a bit wacky when it cooks because each grain has a curled string attached to it.  It has a great kinda nutty flavour though =)

Quinoa is one of my favorite foods... it's so versatile. 
I didn't have apple juice so I substituted orange juice. Also didn't have raisins so I substituted dried cranberries. I was spectacular!
I think that I will try dried blueberries or cherries next time. Wonderful and versatile recipe.

This is my first time trying anything made with quinoa and I was pleasantly surprised.  From the sugestions of others I substituted vanilla soy milk and also added chopped apples.  Also added 1 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp raw sugar.  I can see this as a hot breakfast in the morning :)  Has a natural nutty sweetness to it.

I made this with all rice milk, omitted the apple juice, vanilla , lemon juice, salt and water.  i added splenda, raisins and dried apricots.  it took an extra 10 minutes to cook, but tasted delicious!!! I will def make it again, perhaps with bits of apple added in too.

Quite nice!  Not too sweet, and had a really interesting texture.  This was my first time trying quinoa, and I'm very impressed.  Will definitely make this again, perhaps with more cinnamon and vanilla for a more "comfort food" taste.

This was really good. As others have said, it was tart, so I added soy milk and some maple syrup to sweeten it. I also always serve rice pudding cold with maple syrup on top, so that is what I did here. Again, the maple syrup counteracted the sour taste of the raisins and lemon juice. I did feel that there were too many raisins, so next time I will cut them by half. I will also try substituting soy milk for the apple juice and subbing 1/4 cup apple juice for the lemon juice.

This was good, although too "lemony" for my taste.  I'll make it again (with much less lemon juice) and add some brown sugar for a great breakfast.

I really LOVE this recipe! I tried it tonight for the first time and made it exactly to the recipe.  The one thing that keeps me from rating this a 5 is that, like everyone else, I think it is a bit on the tart side with all of the lemon juice.  I'm gonna try the leftovers in the morning with rice milk mixed in.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I cooked this with almond milk, raisins, chopped honey crisp apples, cinnamon and vanilla. When served, I added stevia to sweeten, as my DH is diabetic, and more almond milk.(In my bowl, I also drizzled on a little sugar-free caramel flavored syrup, the kind you'd add to your coffee drink). Delicious!!!  Oh, I've also used french vanilla coffee creamer in the bowl rather than just adding more almond milk. Either way it was fabulous.  Was great as a breafast cereal OR served as dessert as a 'rice pudding'.

We made this exactly as written and only have one tiny complaint...there is too much lemon juice.  When you take a bite, at first it is sweet and yummy, but then you are immediately overwhelmed by lemon.  It's still good, but I think the lemon juice is overwhelmining.  We will definitely be keeping this recipe, but next time we are going to reduce the lemon juice by half and see how that works.  I know we need that bitterness in there, but we just don't want it to overwhelm the dish.  I think if we can find the right balance of lemon juice, this will definitely be a 5 star dish.  Also, ours had a thinner consistency, more like a nice breakfast dish, an oatmeal replacement.

Excellent! I didn't have apple juice, so I substituted almond milk for both the apple juice and the water, but added a chopped apple. I also didn't have raisins so I used dried cherries instead. This was DELICIOUS! Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe! The only major change I made was to use almond milk in place of the apple juice (1. Because I didn't have any apple juice and 2. I didn't want to add any more sugar to the dish). I have made it changing nothing else and it was great. The last time I made it I added some ground cloves and chopped walnuts which only made this great recipe even better. I usually make extra and keep it in snack size bowls in the fridge for a quick meal or snack.

We liked it. I followed the suggestions to use almond milk and the results were good- it had a presentation almost like rice pudding. I left out the lemon juice, like others suggested. I'd make it again.

I made this one for breakfast today.  Very good.  
I cut out the apple juice because I am diabetic.  It had enough carbs with the dried fruit and the quinoa.  I did put in 1/2 c raisins and 1/2 c dried cranberries.  I cut back to 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice as others said it was too lemony!  I did put about a tsp of sugar free maple syrup on top and it was very good. I will make this again!

The lemon made it too tart in my opinion, so I leave it out completely. But it's a tasty way to start your morning. I serve it HOT with a little butter and honey.

I made this for breakfast this morning and it was delicious!  I added a dash of ground nutmeg while it was simmering and instead of stirring in vanilla extract at the end I grated some walnuts into it.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

Want to bump up the grain?  Add steel cut oats.  1 cup quinoa, 1 cup steel cut oats (3 1/2-4 cups water), 1 tbs. vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg. This is just a basic recipe, can manipulate ingredients to your desire.  I top mine with 1 oz chopped walnuts, 2 tbs raisins and 1/2 cup of soy or low fat milk.

This recipe reminded me of bread pudding.  I used coconut milk for the apple juice and orange juice for the lemon.  Added chopped walnuts and maple syrup.  YUM!!  It was wonderful, having trouble eating just one serving!!

I'd prefer trying this recipe as more of a hot cereal with 1 cup quinoa and 2 cups liquid. The pudding texture was very unusual.

This is good, but way too much liquid.  I use quinoa a lot.  The liquid to grain ratio is 1 part grain and 2 parts liquid.  Adding the additional amount of apple juice made it soup.  Just cook it in the apple juice. and spices with raisins.  Saves a step and tastes great.  Oh--I thought full on juice was too sweet so I halved it and used the rest water.  I'm always looking for ways to use quinoa.  VEry simple to use and I very often use it instead of rice.  Enough protien to not need meat and absorbs a wide variety of flavors.  I NEVeR use soy products any more, as some suggest, but milk would be excellent, as would coconut milk, with asian or Indian flavors to make it a little more exotic.  Also add other fruits and nuts.

Very good!  A nice, sweet way to use Quinoa.  Did not use the lemon juice and added chopped walnuts before serving.  Makes a hearty breakfast.

Not a fan of this recipe. I did cut back on the lemon juice, but still had a funky acidic, um....funk to it. YES, I rinsed the quinoa. I wish some of the people who were creative enough to modify this recipe would post one. That would be easier than having to read through the comments. If you're not a die-hard quinoa fan, don't start with this recipe or at least make with modification other posters listed. I just didn't have those ingredients and was hoping for better results from the original.

Eating it right now. Wished I hadn't used so much lemon juice. Makes it way too tart! And I normally like lemon flavor. Added a little agave nectar to sweeten it and take the tart edge off. Otherwise it's a decent recipe.

I loved it.  I added 8 splenda packets to the entire mixture, a diced apple since I didn't have raisins, and about 1/4 cup almond milk to counter the tartness from the lemon juice a bit.  There is lots of playing room with this.  I'd never made quinoa in a sweet way so I am happy to have learned a fun, easy, and yummy way to eat this grain.

I made this with Almond milk as I didn't have any apple juice. Its hard to rate a recipe when you hange something so inportant to the original recipe. This was good I enjoyed it ate it with frozen yogurt. However if you are someone who generally dosn't like healthnut food then this probably isn't for you. thanx for sharing

This was super easy and very good. I combined advice from other reviewers and cooked the quinoa in 1 c. water, 1 c. apple juice. Then instead of adding more apple juice, I added 1 c. almond milk. If you want a more soupy consistency, add 2 c. liquid, but by adding one cup it made the consistency more like a hearty oatmeal than a pudding. I also added 3/4 c. dried cranberries instead of 1 c. raisins and only 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice. I served with sliced almonds on top, and it made a wholesome, not overly sweet breakfast!

WOW...This was really good.  I bought some Quinoa and was very dissappointed in the taste.  I thought well...I will give it to one of our daughters.  Then I found this recipe.  What a great breakfast hot cereal.  Hubby liked it as well and said "don't loose this recipe".  I did as some suggested cutting back on the lemon juice, used milk instead of apple juice (didn't have any), added 1 Tblspn of Splenda brown sugar.  Thank you Graycat for the recipe.  It will be used often in our home.

Did not like this recipe at all. Even though I'm a huge fan of quinoa, the texture in this instance threw me off. Neither was there enough sweetness to the pudding. It was very...meh. Quite unappetizing.

My son loved this recipe! I followed the directions exactly but I added sliced banana. I also added some Splenda because of the tartness, but other than that I kept everything the same! Really good on a chilly morning for breakfast!

There is no need to cook this 15min/15min as the recipe states. I cooked it both as stated and also adding everything at once, minus the vanilla. I found no taste or texture difference. I thought it was too sweet when made with raisins and found the lemon out of place. However, made with sweetened dried cranberries the lemon worked, and the porridge was not too sweet.

A funny looking apple, cinnamon, and vanilla scented gruel of quinoa and raisins.  The flavor doesn't excite me.  As for texture, one would be hard pressed to call it a pudding.  Incidentally, salt "to taste" was for me a quarter teaspoon.

Great recipe, but yes too "lemony" for my taste also.  I increased the cinnamon, added some nutmeg and grated some apple into it.  Tasted like apple pie.

I love Quinoa in any possible form.  It's even easier to make if you have a microwave with a "rice" setting, as the requirements are basically the same (boil, then simmer 15-20 minutes).  Rice and fresh veggies are, IMHO, the reason to own a microwave!Add quinoa to the list and what's not to love?

Wow! Great breakfast! I sprinkled sliced almonds on the top. But Ooopps, I didn't read the directions and just put it all in the pot instead of the two-steps. Turned out good although I'll do it right the next time which will probably be soon. It was yummy!

Yummy! I too, am new to quinoa, and enjoy the flexibility of this grain. I also made some adjustments to make it more low-glycemic friendly. I cooked the quinao in the water per the recipe, but then added unsweetened vanilla almond milk & cinnamon & simmered for 15 min. I then added 1 tsp. vanilla and 5 small packets of Stevia(adding Agave nectar would be great too!). To my bowl, I then added dried cranberries & walnuts! Next time, I might add Orange extract & peel! Great for breakfast or dessert! Thanks for the great recipe.

Did not care for this at all.  Made as directed (no substitions - how can you rate a recipe when you really did not make THE recipe?) NO nutty flavor, not like a cereal, not really a pudding either.

I agree it was a wee bit too lemony tasting... I would just reduce the lemon juice or omit altogether.  Also, I needed to add a little stevia to satisfy my sweet tooth, and adding milk helped make it a little creamier.  I will try this again with some modifications, but it is a great basic recipe.

I made this in my rice cooker, then after the cooking cycle was done, added skim milk, raisins, cinnamon and vanilla and left it for another 15-20 minutes.  I served it with a splash of coconut milk and a spoonful of brown sugar for breakfast!  Fantastic!

Great recipe!  I add a bit of brown sugar to the mix and more raisins.  I make it on Sundays and then separate it into single serving bowls and bring it to work for breakfast all week!  Great tasting and a healthy start to the day!

This is a very delicious recipe. I made it today and it was perfect. I added it a tablespoon of grind cloves and 3 spoons of brown sugar. 
Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Woah. This was my first experience with quinoa, but no one said anything about the smell! While it was cooking with just the water, it smelt like cooking grass. It took forever for the water to boil off by the way. When it was done.. it still stank. And really didn't taste good either. I soaked and rinsed it, but i am quite displeased. Too much bother for no return.

I made this pretty much as written, but first soaking the quinoa.  I also decreased the lemon to just 1 tbs and I added a small handful of chopped walnuts.  I was underwhelmed with the result ... I kept thinking it needed SOMETHING ... brown sugar sprinkled on top?  Syrup?  Cream?  Maybe more raisins to raise the sweetness level?  Maybe I should have used some sweet milk-type liquid instead of the apple juice, like vanilla Almond milk?  I'm not really sure, but I'm going to keep looking for a quinoa breakfast recipe I like, or i'll try this again with different additions...

Nice! I used half orange juice and half soy milk in place of the apple juice, and dried cherries in place of the raisins.  Tasted good both as a hot breakfast cereal and as a dessert.

Very tasty, although I also used soya milk like many of the suggestions. I love Quinoa & will make this again =)
I have made this many times now. Sometimes I use orange juice instead of the apple juice and or soya milk. I also don't use the salt. I use this for a breakfast change from other hot cereals.

This recipe has great potential, but I agree that the apple juice cooks up too tart and acidic.  I am going to try it with the soy or rice milk next as one member suggested.

I suppose I saw quinoa pudding and thought of a creamy pudding one would eat for dessert. This is not creamy, but it is good! I would think of it not as a dessert but as a breakfast. Nice alternative to oatmeal. I prefer Craisins instead of raisins, so I used those. I also let it simmer in the apple juice for about 20 minutes instead of just 15. That let some of the excess juice evaporate.

Rinse and drain quinoa very well....for even better flavor, after rinsing and draining well, toast the quinoa in a pan either alone or with a 1T butter for 3-4 minutes then proceed with recipe!  Add toasted pecans and a pinch of cardamom!

I Like the taste, but must admit that it is very sweet.  Part of this is probaly my fault, since I used 2 Cups of Pasteurized Apple Cider (since I didn't have any Apple Juice, since the Apple Cider comes in my Local CSA Share) and I used a 1/2 Cup of Golden Raisins and a 1/2 Cup of Craisins.  I did add in 1 Tablespoon of Chia Seeds and 1/2 Teaspoon of Salt.  It makes a hearty breakfast and will be perfect before I go skiing next week and to keep warm this upcoming week.  Next time I will try using one Cup of Almond Milk and 1 Cup of the Pasteurized Apple Cider.  It is a great way to Introduce yourself to Quinoa and to get use to the texture.  Also, good quality Quinoa should already be rinsed and will not have an Acidic Coating on it, so it won't require pre-soaking.

I really love this recipe.  I was looking for an alternative to oatmeal and this is it! I've made it twice - the first time using almond milk instead of apple juice and it was lovely. The second time I also omitted the lemon juice and added a teaspoon of nutmeg. When I'm eating a bowl, I also add a teaspoon of agave nectar over the top. Yummy!!

Mmmm... nutty and delicious!! I always soak the quinoa for about 10-15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly before proceeding with the recipe. Beyond that, I make it pretty much as written with two variations to suit my personal taste. First, even though I love raisins, 1 cup is a bit much for me, so I only add 1/2 cup. And second, I only add 1 teaspoon lemon juice and for me, it was plenty. Some have said they leave the salt out, but be aware that a dash of salt brings out the sweet in recipes, so go ahead and throw it in. It's just a tiny bit and will make a big difference in the finished product. My husband likes this with dried cranberries in place of the raisins and it's equally delicious that way! Once I had dried cherries on hand and used them in place of the raisins and added almond extract -- fabulous!!!

Very, very nice! I followed the advice of "laurieinok" and soaked the seeds for 15 minutes and then I rinsed thoroughly. I cooked this recipe almost the same except I mixed half-and-half dry raisins and dry cranberries and didn't add any salt (enough sodium don't need to add more). I served it with sliced strawberries and sliced bananas, topped with maple syrup. BTW, we, my husband and I, tried a bite with coconut syrup (good but not perfect), another bite with soy milk and brown sugar (very good but not as good as with maple syrup). Have fun, this recipe is so versatile, healthy and yummy! Thank you Graycat

Per other reviewers, I cooked quinoa in less water than original recipe called for (1 1/4 cups, not 1 3/4 cups), subbed cilantro for parsley, added 1/2 finely chopped red onion, and then added a combined lime juice, olive oil cumin dressing, to taste (less than original recipe). Overall very yummy and will make again, adding diced cucumber and more tomato. Thanks!

I'm giving this two stars because my toddler did enjoy it for breakfast this morning, but, for me, the lemon and apple juice was overpoweringly tart which made the raisins seem way too sweet in comparison.  I tried eating the quinoa without the raisins, but it was simply sour.  I also tried this hot and cold.  It's a shame because I like all the components separately and really wanted to enjoy them combined together.

Delicious! I liked it a lot better cold, though. Next time I make it, I might try milk instead of apple juice and eat it warm. I also only put one tablespoon of lemon juice, because one reviewer said it was too lemony, and I'm not a big fan of lemon.

It was good but more like a sweet breakfast food rather than "pudding". I put some maple syrup in mine and used the vailla soy milk. Thank you for sharing, its nice to have an alternative recipe for quinoa.

Ok.  This is my first time trying Quinoa (keen-wa) and I must say it was much better than I expected.  I am trying to make healthier selections.  I thought I would give this keen-waaaaaa a try.  I heard  Dr. Oz speak about it.  Searched for it in Martins and couldnt find last year but found it this go around.  I will say this is a great recipes and I will probably use this a  replacement for my oatmeal every now and then.  I can't wait to try some dinner recipes with this stuff.  Thanks again.

I substituted almond milk for the apple juice and then sweetened with brown sugar.  I had to cook the second stage with the lid off in order for this to get thickened up. I like it for a nice change; but my kids who love multi-grain oatmeal, did not like it at all.

This was tasty and it filled me up for hours. In fact, I think I like it more than oatmeal for breakfast. Used plain soy milk instead of juice.

delicious!
i used 2 1/2 ounces frozen applesauce & 1/4 cup of milk instead of the apple juice.  other than that, i stuck to the recipe.

also, my 7 month old baby had some w/ breast milk, frozen applesauce & a sprinkle of cinnamon.  he loved it!

Mmmmm!!

I didn't have any apple juice, so I boiled a chopped apple in 1 1/3 cup water with a bit of sugar and cinnamon (then just used this liquid for the recipe). The apple pieces were really tasty in it!

Maybe I got some bad quinoa or haven't come to appreciate it's flavor yet, but neither I,no anyone in my family enjoyed this recipe. I added some dried apples to this and thought it'd turn out nicely, but we just didn't like it.

I really like this pudding.  The consistency is more of a gruel.  Ever since my brother introduced me to quinoa, I have been interested in finding different ways to prepare it because it is so good for you.  This is a good recipe, and not hard to make at all.  I am going to find some unsweetened apple juice to make it less sweet next time, but that is just a personal preference.

This was very easy, and quite good - warm or cold. I might cut down on the lemon juice next time I make it. It looks a bit weird (my parents wouldn't even try it) but if you can get past that, I think you'll like it!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It's makes a wonderful dessert or tasty breakfast. The instructions were well written and easy to follow. The ingredients were also easy to obtain. The only thing I found that didn't line up with the recipe is the amount of time it took me to cook the quinoa. I took me closer to twenty-five minutes with the stove on until the water was completely absorbed.

I have made this recipe several times but with some substitutions. I use cranberry juice instead of apple juice and dried cranberries instead of raisins. I brought it to a potluck at work and it was a hit.

I will make this again.  I cut back on sugars, including juices.  I feel like fruit has enough natural sugars, but I intended to buy apple juice for this recipe and I plain forgot it at the store.  I cut in an apple and I did a few squeezes of lemon over top, but not too much because I didn’t have apple juice.  I added the vanillla extract and lots of cinnamon and it was awesome just like this.  I feel like once the flavors sit overnight, this will be a pretty tasty breakfast.  Thanks for sharing this recipie!

I wish I'd read the reviews before making. It had a strange taste, and I think that was due to the lemon juice. I can't get through even 1 bowl of this stuff. Maybe it'd be better without the lemon juice, but at the moment, I can't bear the thought of having another pot of quinoa pudding to choke down, changes or no changes.

It's ok. Second time cooking with quinoa.  Don't forget to soak it for 10-15 minutes before cooking.  This reminded me of oatmeal so I treated it that way, with milk and brown sugar.

Made this with 2 cups of soy milk rather than apple juice and used less lemon juice.  I played around with the cinnamon and vanilla until I got the taste that I wanted.  Added a little honey for sweetness.  I think this will make a great winter breakfast.

A good healthy dessert or breakfast  meal.  Friendly for vegan or low gluten diets. I made it exactly as written, and  for my taste I found it a little bit too sweet and lemony. Next time I make it I will cut the amount of  raisins and lemon juice  in half.

Very good.  I did leave out the lemon juice, as I didn't think I'd enjoy the tartness that it would add.  I also subbed milk for the apple juice, as I didn't have any on hand, and added splenda to taste to make up for the sweetness the apple juice would've added.  I enjoyed this for breakfast instead of my normal oatmeal.

Nice, simple recipe. I halved it and used raspberry-apple juice, which made it taste even better. I forgot to add the vanilla, which would have helped, but added some nutmeg and swapped the raisins for dried cranberries. I ate it with some hazelnut milk. Delicious--will make again.

I tried quinoa for the first time with this recipe a few weeks back, and have made it several times since!  I took the helpful advice of the previous reviewers, omitting the lemon juice and using soy milk in place of the apple juice, and it's definitely a winner!

This was just okay.  I thought it was too tart and the recipe came out very sticky and mushy.  I won't make this again.

I love this recipe! like others I used less lemon juice - I also used one cup of light vanilla soy milk and one cup water to cook Quinoa.

GREAT RECIPE.  I ALTERED IT TO BE A LITTLE LOWER ON THE GI SCALE.  INSTEAD OF THE APPLE JUICE I DID WATER WITH AGAVE SYRUP.  IT HAS BECOME A FAMILY FAVORITE!!!!!

I thought this was excellent! I usually hate reviewing recipes when I have modified them - but I had to onit the apple and lemon juices, and used organic vanilla soy instead as my husband HATES apple juice. Otherwise I made as directed. It is good leftover as well. Thanks for sharing!

Almost too sweet and a bit watery. I will try using natural applesauce instead of the apple juice next time.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but there was just something missing. I think I expected it to be a bit creamier.

This is my first time trying quinoa... I rinsed it VERY well but wasn't all that keen on the taste...
I did adjust the recipe to what I had on hand... used vanilla soy milk, omitted raisins but added chopped banana... so maybe that was the problem. I found it very bland and had to add a touch of brown sugar and honey. I'll experiment with quinoa again... but probably not with this recipe.

I have been looking for a good way to enjoy quinoa and this is it...it's very good. A lot like rice pudding, actually. I was surprised how creamy it seemed without any dairy in it.

I like quinoa so I thought I would try this.  It is really nice but I think that it is sweet enough without the maple syrup.  Great warm with fruit and soy milk.

Mine came out very acidicbitter tasting (kind of like tangy apple cider)  My husband said that boiling apple juice ferments it and makes it bitter. I also think the lemon juice contributed to the acidic taste. I ended up putting in a bunch of soy milk and raw sugar at the end and that kind of mellowed it out a little.  I will probably make this again but I will use soy milk and raw suger (kind of like the way I make rice pudding).
