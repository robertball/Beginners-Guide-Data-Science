Oh yeah, this ones a keeper.  Do make extra dressing for other salads.  My only suggestion would be to include a few thin slices of red onion in the spinach.

Wow!  My wife came in to my home office and said that she was uninspired and wanted some ideas.  I was plum out and did a search for "recipe" on Google.  This site came up.  This was the first recipe we found.  It seemed really easy so we went with it.  We were blown away.  Our kids loved it.  I loved it.  It made a bland baked chicken dinner special and a little exotic.  Since we had the eggs cooked already, it took about ten minutes for the bacon and that was it.  

Also, we didn't have water chestnuts so we used macadamia nuts.  Yummy!

I love this recipe.  I don't use the hard-boiled eggs; however.  I do add chopped walnuts and mandarin orange slices.  Delicious!

My boyfriend doesnt like spinach and he doesnt like salad...so when he ate two plates of this, I was shocked!!  I wanted a light salad for Valentine's Day, so i just put water chestnuts and walnuts on top of spinach with this dressing.  He said it was the best dressing ever, and he was only eating salad cuz the dressing was sooo good. A note, I tried using less dishes and not lugging out the food processor...doesn't work!! You MUST put it in the food processor, or else it looks realy disgusting and lumpy.  Great recipe!!!!

This is such a great salad.  I served it to 45 women at a church dinner and got rave reviews.  I had tons of requests to email them the recipe.

Very good! I was looking for something a little different and this was it! My 6 year old daughter loved it and so did my husband. I made it lower-carb by substituting Splenda for the sugar, low-carb ketchup for the regular and I used walnuts instead of the water chestnuts. I thought it needed a little something else so I added a little fresh minced garlic and cracked black pepper.

*updated 12/23/07 * I still make this, but now add dried cranberries or dried cherries, add pecans instead of walnuts and make the dressing with the bacon grease instead of oil, not heart healthy but WOW!!

The best we have had in a long time = key is the
wonderful, fresh dressing = plenty left over!  I chopped the water chestnuts up and used as garnish
and they seemed to gain a little in taste.  We will have this again = use baby spinach -- thanks!!   claudette

Very great recipe. My husband is a huge spinach salad fan and this one was a big hit.
I saved some of the dressing in the fridge and we have it on other salads... I always get great comments on the dressing.

My husband said it is his new favorite salad and I agree.  The only thing different is that I used Splenda instead of sugar...and used just a little bit less than the 1/2 C so it wasn't too sweet.  Yummy!

Excellent teste and easy to make. The only complaint I got was that there was more dressing than needed but that could be due to the US/Metric conversion factors as well. Everyone loved the salad though!

Excellent flavour. However, way too much dressing. I used only half of the dressing I made, and it was too much also.
You may want to cut the sugar in half - too sweet otherwise.

This salad is very unusual and surprisingly tasty. I made 1/2 the recipe (as written), but added a little bit of salt. It is quite strong and you only need just a little bit. I served about 4 cups of spinach and still have dressing left. Instead of water chestnuts I added sliced almonds for crunch. My only complaints were that it was a little too sweet and the fresh onion was a bit overpowering. I will definitely be making this again but cut back on the sugar & onion or use onion powder instead.

I served this at a Memorial Day party and everyone loved it.   I didn't have water chestnuts so omitted those and used less oil.

I am eating this salad as I write. Amazing. I followed some others' suggestions but I think it's such a great base recipe that I still gave it 5 stars. The dressing is excellent. It does make quite a large batch, but I'm happy to have it around! Definitely looking forward to making this at my next potluck or dinner party

I really like this dressing for fresh spinach. I also use a little less sugar and onion, as previous reviewers have mentioned. The recipe makes a large quantity of dressing, so I often just make 1/2 the amount of dressing; that's plenty for me and my husband to use for a couple of days.

Ever hear of people taking seconds of SALAD at Easter dinner?!  This was very tastey.  It looks like a lot of work, but using precooked bacon from the store, some Easter eggs we already had, and baby spinach I didn't have to rip much, it was really fast.  Plus, all the dressing ingreadients *just* fit in my minichopper (didn't need to lug out the big blender or food processor).  We used extra light olive oil and skipped the water chesnuts. It makes a lot of dressing so we had some on some romaine the next day with lunch (of course with bacon and chopped up Easter eggs) and it was still really good.

Thie was really good!  I had it for dinner one night and there wasn't anything left!  The ketchup in the dressing sounds weird but tastes great! I'll be making this again.

My husband does NOT like spinach but my oldest son wanted to try Popeye's Spinach at the store, so I wanted to make it taste as good as could be so that he'd know he likes spinach.  My husband ate 3 helpings and my son ate all his salad too.  Even my 3 year old daughter loved it.  And such simple ingredients that we have all the time.  Can't wait to make this again.  Could have cut the dressing in half since it made so much, but now we have more for later.  So delicious!  Update: I like cheese on my salads and had some Feta in the fridge... awesome!

I added some things to the salad part, and used 2 tbs. granulated onions instead of regular onions for the dressing, I also used only 2 tbs of Splenda instead of 1/2 cup of sugar. Turned out great! The dressing is soooooo yummy- this is my new favorite salad dressing! Even my EXTREMLY picky husband liked it. Next time I think I'll try the dressing with some Vidalia (sp?) sweet onions.

Supper YUMMY salad.  One of the Best spinach salad reciped ever.  I doubled/tripled the amount of bacon and eggs for more flavor and used dried onions.  I put all the ingrediants for the dressing in a pitcher and shook.  Less time, less clean up and the dressing still came out wonderful!!  Also the salad is great with or without the chestnuts.

This is a family recipe we have used for years -- only difference is no water chestnuts. The dressing is even better if you marinate it overnight before using.

Very good and the dressing was a nice surprise.  I decreased the sugar and ketchup by half.

This salad was delicious and the dressing was soooo tasty!  I actually added sliced onion to the salad and omitted the water chestnuts.  It is a definite hit in my family!

Very good.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half -- a bit sweet.  Also, we used shallots instead of onion - yummy.

I discovered this recipe during the X-mas holidays and have had made every week since. It is delicious!! Also very simple to make. I have left out the eggs in the recipe as I am not a big fan of them. This recipe has been a hit with all dinner guests and many friends have asked for the recipes

Agreed about the onion taste - maybe just onion powder next time.  Very yummy though - might add some fresh tomatoes.

The dressing is wonderful, my hubby kept saying "outstanding" can't beat that :)

Wonderful Salad-especially the dressing.  You absolutely must use a food processor for the dressing to have it turn out the way it is intended!  I did use thin slices of purple onion & dried cranberries in the salad!  It was a hit!  YUM!

I used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon to make this a lot less fatty and it was great. The dressing's a bit sweet, I'll probably use less sugar in it next time. Otherwise it was great!

Delicious combination of flavors.  I omitted the water chestnuts and used 1 T. onion powder instead of the onions.  There is PLENTY of extra dressing, which I think will be great on other salads too.  Everyone really liked this salad.

My only complaint about this recipe is that the directions for cooking the eggs didn't work at all!  My eggs were still completely runny inside, until I finished boiling them for longer (we don't usually eat whole eggs, so I admit, I didn't know how long to cook them!).  The French-style dressing went well with the other textures and flavors in the salad.

I really liked this spinach salad, especially the dressing.  When I made the salad itself, I left out the water chestnuts and added some diced tomato's from my garden and I also added cucumbers.  As for the dressing I used honey instead of sugar, red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar, and extra light olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  In place of the regular bacon I used turkey bacon.  It turned out really good.  I will be making this again in the very near future.

The salad itself was OK, pretty much a standard spinach salad.  I didn't care for the dressing at all.  It was too sweet for my taste.  I won't be making this again.

The dressing was absolutely amazing! I used onion powder since I'm not a big onion fan and it was deelicious! I didn't add water chestnuts and I used bacon bits instead and it was really very good. As I said, I don't like onions but I think that some would think it would be good with red onions. Just a thought:)

I thought that it was a good salad, maybe decrease
the 1/2cup sugar to 1/4 cup sugar and you could add red onion slices and mandarin oranges for a bit more taste.   Marycat 2708

This was fabulous!  I had to opt out of some ingredients but it does not seem to matter much what you put in it because the dressing is so delicious!  I omitted the egg and chestnuts and substituted in pecans.  I noticed some added red onion and i wish i would have had that on hand.... goat or feta cheese would have also been a nice addition.

I was craving a salad like this one and couldn't find my recipe.  This one was the closest.  For the dressing, decrease the ketchup and sugar by half or it tastes too sweet and too much like ketchup.  Add fresh mushrooms and croutons to the salad and omit the water chesnuts.  Then you have the perfect salad!

This recipe makes not only the perfect salad, but the perfect dressing as well. We really enjoyed this (omitted the water chestnuts, and sometimes add cooked chicken, fresh mushrooms, and grated carrots), and the dressing is one that I make for use on other salads as well.  I have made the dressing both with and without the ketchup, and either way it's delicious.

Absolutely delicious.  It is a very classic spinach salad recipe, and had a nice ratio of flavors in the dressing.  I served it with baby back pork ribs and curried couscous.  Everything was gobbled up!

Outstanding, easy-to-make salad that got rave reviews from everyone at Easter dinner!  Makes a ton of dressing, but it's nice to have leftovers to use on a garden salad.  Used a red onion in the dressing and added a few thin onion slices to the salad, and it was delicious.

I'm rating the dressing as I didn't follow the recipe and use the "mix ins" (bacon, eggs & water chestnuts).  As others have said, you could halve the dressing and still have some left over.  My husband and 13 yo daughter enjoyed it but my 4 and 5 yo said it was "too sour".  I thought the dressing was too over powering.  I couldn't taste the salad (spinach, chicken, red onion, feta & toasted pecans).  Maybe half of the sugar and ketchup?  I will try that as my hubby asked me to "put this recipe on rotation!"

My husband liked it, but I did not.  The dressing amounted to a catalina type dressing.  I found it too overpowering for the spinach and egg.  A more subtle dijon vinaigrette, or simple red wine vinaigrette brings out the flavors of the spinach, egg and bacon as it should.  This dressing in this recipe is all I tasted. I made the dressing exactly as the recipe was written.  It also made a lot of dressing, far more than necessary for the amount of spinach.  I'll use it up in a  hearty chef's salad with cold deli chicken.

The dressing is extremely tasty and does make the salad (as most dressings do!). The only change I made was substitue onion powder for the onion as my hubby has a digestive problem with onions. I used about 3 tbsp. I also only made 1/2 of the recipe and still had plenty of dressing!! Thanks!!

This rating is mainly for the dressing, it was fabulous!  I wasn't sure if my husband would like it since it has a sweetness to it, but he loved it!  I added some fresh ground pepper and a little salt to taste.   Thanks for sharing!

This is my "new Spinach Salad Dressing". Very nice, reminded me of a Catalina Dressing. I added garlic, salt & pepper and left in the fridge for awhile. It really improves over time.

I love the dressing! This is the only way I'll eat spinach. I omit the water chestnuts and add fruit.  During strawberry season I add fresh sliced berries, and in the winter when the strawberries are too expensive I add a small can (drained) of mandarin oranges. I always serve the dressing separate so each one can add as much as they want.

The dressing was good (I just made the dressing with spinach and chopped nuts as we had no bacon or eggs.)
My only complaint was that it had a VERY strong onion flavor (I had a pretty strong onion) so I would recommend less onion, or a vidalia or some other sweet onion.

I liked this recipe, and my guests seemed to love it.  I doubled it and ended up with WAY too much dressing.  Next time I will double the salad part only and keep the dressing recipe the same.  It was a very easy and nice addition to our cookout.

This salad was fantastic!  I left out the water chestnuts and added some ripe chopped avocado and fresh tomato since I had them on hand.  Next time I'll use a little less onion, but otherwise the dressing made a nice sweet contrast to the tangy spinach.

Excellent recipe, and I didn't even have any bacon!  The dressing is very good!  I used hard boiled egg, feta, craisins, sliced almonds.  Even my husband who doesn't like spinach salads ate it all.  Can't wait to try it with the bacon :)

I thought this was just okay.  I thought the dressing was very sweet and overpowering. The recipe made WAY more dressing than needed.  You could definitely cut the dressing in half and cut the sugar at least in half.  I might try it again doing that and I'll be sure to just drizzle a bit of dressing on my salad.  I think after reading all the rave reviews about the dressing, I was overzealous in applying it.

MMMM! So good! My family loved it and asked for it again. I used a 6oz bag of spinach and the amount of dressing was more than enough for several salads. I put the extra in a jar to keep for the next time we make it. Also, shortcut: I used Oscar Meyer bacon pieces!

I was looking for a dressing to use for a traditional spinach salad; the salad components that I had in mind were exactly the same as listed in this recipe. The dressing was awesome! Perfect amount of tanginess. I used slightly less oil, as I always do. So glad I made a full dressing receipe, even as I prepared only half of the amount of salad. Now I'll have enough to use on other salads later this week. Delicious!

Some of the members of my family are unbelievably picky but I forced them to eat this for Mother's Day and they practically licked the bowl clean! I was convinced a whole small onion would be overpowering but it wasn't - accompanied with the ketchup the onion gave the dressing a great tang. I will definitely make this again!

I made this salad for an Easter picnic. It was very good...I did slice some red onions and add them to the salad along with some fresh mushrooms.  The dressing was really good.  I added some garlic salt and cracked black pepper.  Everyone really enjoyed it - thanks!

This was terrific! I had to omit the water chestnuts due to allergies, but it was still great. Thanks.

I thought the dressing was a little strong, and the salad didn't have enough variety of tastes to offset it. It was good, but not great.

This is a great salad.   I took it to dinner at a friends house and everyone loved it. I don't care for waterchestnuts so I left them out and I added 1/2 red onion thinly sliced, sliced fresh mushrooms and toasted slivered almonds.

Sorry I did not like this at all. I found it too vinegary and sweet all at the same time… If that makes sense. I ended up throwing a whole bunch more oil, Worcester garlic and Dijon mustard into it to try to save the ingredients.

We love this salad. The great thing is you can sub different oils and vinegars.  I saute the onoion a  bit in the bacon grease just to soften them.  I only add a pinch of sugar if any because i dont like sweet..

Made this for an office holiday party. Everyone now wants me to bring it to the next event. I was nervous about the ketchup but it all worked very nicely.

I'm trying to replicate the spinach salad from the Copper Kettle at McAlpin's department store in Cincinnati that closed up many years ago. This isn't it, but this is an awesome spinach salad!

I have made this a few times now.  I half the amount of sugar as the ketchup also has quite a lot of sugar.  Sometimes I add fresh mushrooms for additional texture.  It's a keeper!
