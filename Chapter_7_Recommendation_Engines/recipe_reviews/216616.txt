Great idea, never occurred to me to use my pressure cooker for this. What a time saver!  Suggestion for freezing - - after it has cooled, gather several small plastic containers. Measure out 1 cup of stock into each container and place them in the freezer. The next day after they have all frozen, pop the the frozen "puck" out of the plastic container and put them all into a ziploc freezer bag. So when you need chicken stock you just grab as many "cups" as you need out of the plastic bag that is in the freezer! Using this method has encouraged me to use chicken stock in place of water for cooking veggies etc, because its so convenient to just grab one out of the freezer!

I absolutely LOVE my pressure cooker and use it all the time.  And I use chicken stock in many different recipes. This is very simular to the recipe I use, except I don't use quite as many garlic cloves, but it's my personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe; more people should use their pressure cookers.  It's cost effective and energy effective.  And the food that comes out of that pressure cooker - words cannot discribe.  They are now safer than ever before, and I have been using them for 40+ years.

This is a great way to get the chicken carcass out of the refrigerator. I did the recipe exactly as shown, got 2 cups of bits and pieces of chicken (went into the freezer) plus a lot of fresh stock, which also went into the freezer in one quart freezer bags. I will be using this recipe again and again!

Good broth recipe.  Adjust seasonings to your own taste. I find that the best flavor comes when made with a rotisserie ckn carcass.  There's an extra flavor when uasing them.  I also chop the veggies a little smaller & sautee them for more flavor & throw in the skin.  Good flavor there too.  Worried about fat?  You can always skim  broth when it's cooled.  I do remove any meat from the carcass before cooking & save it for later use.  I recently bought a 71/2 qt. electric pressure cooker from wolfgang
& it's great.  It's a no brainer!

As long as you have the pressure cooker out, why not go ahead and seal the jars? That way there's no need to use it up right away.

This is really a great method for making chicken stock.  I roast the bones and the vegetables and then into the pot with all the lovely drippings.  Great flavor and a money saver to boot!

I am new to this site and found this recipe. I am always using chicken stock but really dislike buying it so I prepared this last night. THIS IS GREAT. I put it in my pressure cooker for about an hour and when I tasted it, I was totally blown away. THIS IS MY GO TO RECIPE from now on. Thank you so much for sharing. :)

I actually make my chicken stock the same way and it turns out great every time! Its a very cost effective method and its not at all time consuming.  I would use 3-4 cloves of garlic instead of 10 and I use a 1 tsp of oil just to get the look and also a tsp of turmeric. Turmeric give it a lovely color.

I made this exact recipe this morning with a BBQ chix carcus.  This is my weekly thing since my husband cannot have luncheon meat.  I also added a teas. of tummeric to add a lovely color. I figure by making my own broth it pays for some of the cost of the BBQ chix also very healthy for you.

This was good, but I find myself substantially reducing the stock.  That may, however, be due to how it was originally cooked (was surprised to find how thick/fatty the original 'stock' before I made the stock, that left by the cooking, turned out once I strained and separated it - perhaps I simply didn't need to force another quart or three out of the heap) and/or that I included some, but not all, of the skin (meant to transfer it all, simply forgot what I was doing while pulling the bird).  Or perhaps my assessment of proper stock dilution is simply wrong.  In any case, whatever the cause, I'll do this same technique/recipe again next time just with less than the prescribed water in the pressure cooker.  Also, even on the weak side of chicken flavor this simply makes an unusually good vegetable stock.

I made this as "unrapid" as possible by using my slowcooker since I don't have a pressure cooker. It was my first try at stock or broth and this recipe sounded like what I wanted in it. I used the carcass from the turkey breast that we cooked on the bbq and also threw in some of the skin. It cooked on low all night and part of the morning. I forgot to time it but at least 12 hours. May have been overkill but I didn't have space yet and thought it worth mentioning. I ended up with enough for a big pot of chicken noodle soup and 3qts for the freezer. Very good flavor and would use this recipe again.

I was skeptical that I could get the same flavour that I do when I simmer it for hours in a slow cooker but I was so wrong.  I used the carcass from The Best Roast Chicken, also on this site. I roasted the bones for an hour @325ยบ and used a little of the fat to saute the veggies for 10 minutes. I washed but didn't peel the carrot and left the skin on the onion, it adds flavour and colour. The only other change that I made was cutting the garlic back to 5 cloves as they were huge. This has amazing flavour and it so much faster than my old method. It's a keeper!!
Update: I now add 1 1/2 tsp of apple cider vinegar to the water, this breaks down the bones and produces a richer broth.

I save onion scraps when I am chopping onions.  Same for celery.  When I have vegetables that are about to age out I toss them in the freezer too.   I use all of these frozen "scraps" when making stock.    Sometimes I brown the bones of the carcass - sometimes not.  I will use a turkey or chicken carcass with my vegetable scraps and some herbs (fresh if in the summer) and get the BEST stock virtually for free.  I do not add salt until I am ready to use the stock as sometimes other ingredients can be very salty. ETA: I can the stock in pint jars my Presto pressure canner.  I DO NOT use my electric pressure cooker for canning as the National Center for Home Preservation  recommends against it.

I have been making stock in the Pressure Cooker for years.. We buy a whole cooked chicken from Costco ($6) strip the meat and use that for recipes/dinner. Put bones and skin in to the pressure cooker, water , spices (i suggest adding fennel and cumin) a little balsamic vinegar and cook at pressure for 30 min. let it cool, drain and put into containers for the fridge. 1-2 days later - skim the fat and voila! stock that is so delicious! Make homemade soup (2 kinds) every week.

Perfect chicken stock. You can add more seasonings as you use this in your other recipes. But this is the perfect start!

Great recipe, although I don't put any extra salt in -- can always add later to whatever I make with the stock.

For those of us in cold climates, skip the wasteful ice cube bath method of cooling the stock quickly/safely and use outdoor temps to do it for you.  You will saving electricity, water, and the environment.  I put some of the stock in ice cube trays, freeze (covered) out on my deck here in AK, and then put the cubes in a ziploc in the freezer.

Great recipe. I just finished making stock with a turkey carcus. I have a smaller preassure cooker and filled it just to the 2/3 point. I adjusted the vegetables to my taste and will can it tomorrow after I remove the hardened fat. I will do this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I can't say enough about this chicken stock.  It was very flavorful and easy to make.  It makes every other stock pale in comparison.  It is great in recipes, but it is awesome enough on its own with fresh buttered crusty bread.

This was great!  I didn't make any changes, and it turned out wonderfully.  The aroma in the kitchen, while it was cooking, was to die for.  There's was less chicken fat to skim off then I was anticipating.  I broke the stock down in cup measures and froze for use later.

BakingNana gave possibly the best cooking tip when she advised to roast carcass and veggies before cooking the stock. i roast ham bones as well as poultry in a slow (250 f) oven for 3-5 hours (longer if i forget about it). With Thanksgiving here, a roast turkey carcass breaks up easier to fit into pressure cooker.

This was one of the first recipes I made in my new Instant Pot. It turned out very flavorful. I used a turkey breast carcass as well as a Costco rotisserie chicken carcass, and at the suggestion of other reviewers, I used 5 large garlic cloves. The only downside to using a pressure cooker is that I find the smaller bones harder to find when separating the meat from the bones.  Also, because I had more bones, the IP didnโt hold as much water as the recipe called for, which was my fault. It made excellent broth for chicken and noodles..

Seems to come out clearer than if simmered over time. Rich enough to jell when refrigerated.

I highly seasoned my chicken so all I did after removing it from the pot was ladle some off to make gravy with, added more water and cooked as directed. What a great idea to make bone broth in just 20 minutes. The dogs enjoyed the meat after it had fallen off the bones

Worked well.  I have tried in the past to leave it at temp. for 40 min and doing a quick release.  The 30min with the natural release produced a more rich result.

This was my first ever use of my Instant Pot and the broth turned out great.  Based on reviews, I cut the garlic in half, but probably didn't need to.  At the end, I added a lot of salt.
