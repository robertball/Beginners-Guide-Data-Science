Worth tracking down the authentic ingredients! The taste is sweet, tangy, salty, and spicy! Unique! I salted the rim with black lava salt, but the Sangrita really makes it salty enough. Squirt is unique too... try to find it.

fantastic, old family tradition!  sweat and tangy with just enough spice.
