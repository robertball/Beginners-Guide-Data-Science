I didn't have any scallops, so I left them out.  I also didn't have any Old Bay seasoning, so I mixed another Tblsp of butter and the garlic with some panko breadcrumbs and some seasoned salt, lemon zest and pepper and sprinkled this mixture over the  fish and shrimp.  It was delicious.  Halibut is $10 a pound on sale here in Las Vegas, and I was looking for a recipe that would do it justice.  This was it.  Next time I'll make sure I have all the right ingredients.  Excellent recipe!

This was just an okay dish for us. I think there was just simply too much liquid for it to get golden brown the way I like it--I think using just butter and leaving out the wine would have taken care of that. As written, it almost poaches rather than bakes. Not bad, but just average and won't be on my "make again" list. Update 8/10/2015:  I just made this again, not realizing I had already tried it and vowed I wouldn't make it again.  Interesting that  the review I prepared this time was virtually the same as the last: Couldn't  give this a more perfect rating for ease of preparation, that's for sure.  One pan, no greasy stove, just lay it all in a pan, dump a few things on it, and bake.  Done.  But - sometimes perfect short cuts  are reflected  with imperfect results, which is the case here.  Because there was too much wine, there really was no "sauce," as others spoke of.  Too much wine prevented the seafood from roasting.  Rather, it just briefly stewed in juices.  Still good, but not the roasted quality with buttery sauce I had hoped for and expected.   Funny thing, you couldn't taste the wine anyway.  If/when I make this again, I'll be sure to use just half the wine called for, if any at all.  As for the quality of the final product in terms of taste and of the degree to which it was done, over or underdone, it was perfection.

Wow, this recipe is fantastic!  I cooked 1/2 lb. each of scallops and shrimp, and used captain's cut cod instead of the halibut.  I increased the butter and lemon juice, and also added the chopped parsley before it went in the oven.  I served the "juice" from the pan alongside for dipping.  My husband and I devoured every last bite.  Thanks so much for the recipe Michelle, this one is a keeper!

Not bad at all.  No halibut at the fish market that day, so being the Jersey Girl I am I picked up fresh flouder.  I thought there was an aweful lot of liquid in this recipe, but it made a nice sauce that I poured over the couscous and asparagus as sides.

YUM!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The scallops turned out amazing!!!!! better than any restaurant's scallops I've ever had.  the halibut was good, too.  I think the shrimp may have been a bit overcooked.  I cooked the dish for 10 minutes and let it sit on the stove in the pan with no heat for an extra two minutes.  I will make again.  My husband said it felt like a "saturday night meal", not like a wednesday night meal. ;)
Thank you for the recipe!

This is a really easy dish to prepare and you can easily change the ingredients to suit your tastes or what you have on hand.  I have made this several times and had several kinds of white fish.  Thanks for the post.

My husband made this with his catch of the day (one bake with Amberjack, one bake with Grouper)along with fresh, local shrimp and scallops.  It was absolutely wonderful!!!  We live in Florida and use fresh seafood often. We will definitely make it again!

This was delicious!  Simple and fresh flavors enhance the natural flavors of the fish.  We used Mahi Mahi instead of Halibut and it was to die for!

I don't really like scallops, so I left those out.  It was easy and really good!  Even my cook-snob boyfriend said he liked it!

This had very good flavor.  I mixed the butter, wine, garlic and old bay in a measuring cup and poored over the talapia filets and medium shrimp in a 8x12 glass dish.  I had to lift the filets to the top at the end and broil for a couple more minutes.  The taste of the sauce was delicious.  I think the leftovers will be very good too.

This recipe is amazingly simple and so good. The only thing I did differently was add a coulple more cloves of garlic, and sauteed the garlic and butter first to, get more of the garlic flavor. I also used cod, because halibut was not in season, but I am excited to try it with the halibut!

I agree with others; you must add more old bay, garlic and lemon juice to get more flavor. It taste GREAT!

I just used Halibut and sea scallops.  I cut the halibut into pieces about the same size as the scallops for more even cooking.  As some recommended, I increased the butter to 3 tablespoons and decreased the wine to about 1 tablespoon.  I put panko crumbs on top of each piece (some fell in between -- I left it there) and sprinkled it all with some Parmesan before drizzling with the butter/wine/spice mixture.  I added a little dried parsley for color.  Since I didn't have Old Bay, I used some creole seasoning that I had, and increased the amount for some extra zing.  Turned out GREAT!  Hubby kept commenting between every bite -- will definitely make this again!

Thought this was great.  I recommend topping the dish with a couple of finely-diced shallots along with the garlic, etc.  It adds a nice texture.  Also, I didn't bother melting the butter.  I just topped each piece of meat with a bit of room temp butter.  Marvelous tasting dish!

This recipe was tasty.  I did not have any halibut, but I used 1 lb scallops and 1 lb lg. shrimp.  I think the shrimp cooked faster than the scallops as they were a little tough.  Next time I will decrease the time.  I also used dried parsley as that is what I had on hand.

I made this for my Hubby for Valentine's Day. It came out excellent (I did not include the wine per other reviews). I also made the Lobster Stew for an appetizer and Pink Cloud for Desert (all recipes from this site).  It turned out to be a wonderful meal. Hubby said he enjoyed it more than going out because it was just our time on Valentines. Would definatly make this meal again but only for special occasions because it was rather expensive. I love allrecipes.com!!!

I love to cook but because I am working and going to school, I get to do it only once a week.  I made this recipe last night for my husband and we both loved it.  I cut down on the liquid after reading the reviews here and I'm glad I did.  Served it with Parmesan string beans.  Delicious.

Concept and flavors are really good!  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to cook the fish on the range instead of baking it in the oven.  The halibut ended up taking longer to cook and I kept having to pull it out to check for doneness.  Since fish is so easily under/over cooked, I like to keep a close eye on it.  Overall, it's a keeper!

This was wonderfully tasting and easily made! I eventually plan to serve this as a "company" dish. It tastes like a lot of effort, but took very little time for such a flavorful dish.

This was quite good. I did substitute cod for the halibut, but left everything else the same. I like things slightly more seasoned, and I think I will double the garlic and Old Bay next time as the fish was slightly bland. The sauce leftover in the pan didn't go to waste - we used it on snap peas and a baked potato to go with the dish.

Due to reviews, I modified the recipe in the following ways:
I sauteed 3 cloves of minced garlic and one green onion in the butter, added the lemon juice (doubled) and 1/3 cup of wine. I reduced the sauce for about five minutes and added the seasonings. (instead of Old Bay I used an old Bay substitue recipe) I poured it over the raw seafood (just shrimp and scallops this time) and baked it for about 10 minutes until done. I dumped seafood, the sauce it baked in, and 12oz of cooked frozen vegetables in enough cooked pasta for 2 and mixed it up. It looked absolutely fantastic! It tasted pretty good, however I regret doubling the lemon juice. Was a little too tangy. Otherwise it turned out pretty good.

This was so-so delicious. I couldn't get enough of the sauce. I used tilapia instead of halibut because that's the fish I keep around. I also added a chicken buillon cube to the sauce so I left out the salt. I put it all over linguine. Will make again and again!

There are not sufficient words to describe how wonderful this was but I will try.  This was the main dish for my husband and my Non-Traditional Thanksgiving meal this year.  My husband prepared this exactly as the recipe called for and it was FABULOUS!  Be sure to spend a little more on FRESH seafood.  Frozen scallops are generally rubbery and although Tilapia would also taste good, the Halibut is just so good it wouldn't be the same if substituted.

A little too much butter for me, but overall, simple and delicious.  I served with roasted asparagus and wild rice.

I made this seafood bake for my friends birthday, it was to die for! I served the juices in a seperate dish with fresh baguette to dip, it was fantastic. I highly recommend trying it!

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and it was fantastic! I left out the seafood seasoning because I forgot to buy it. I also couldn't find halibut fillets, so I used halibut steaks. I had to cook it longer and the shrimp and scallops were a little overdone, but that was my fault. I served this with roasted asparagus, garlic dinner rolls and white wine. I think it will be our Valentine's dinner from now on. Thanks!!

The seafood was all cooker well, but there was a flavor element missing.  Next time I will either use more Old Bay or I will put the garlic in the microwave with the butter so it infuses more of the flavor.  Served it with grilled asparagus and it was a great pairing.

Family loved it. Simple to make and not an expensive meal to make. As with every recipe I added a little more spices to the liking of my family's taste.  I served over spinach linguini and added garlic bread on the side.

I swapped Tony Chachere's spice for the Old Bay just because I've use it too frequently.  I also dusted with Italian Breadcrumbs for texture.    The seafood came out delicious.  More like a Scampi.

Wow! This was fantastic, and it works very well as a romantic dinner for two. In fact, I made it for Valentine's Day! I made one change, reluctantly, because I went to three different stores and none of them had halibut, so I used cod loin instead. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  This one's a winner!

It has a good flavor, but I doubled the ingredients and it was too much liquid.  I want to try it again with less liquid, and fresh garlic (I used pre-minced, refrigerated) .  We liked the flavor of all the seafood!

Amazing dinner! I made it for four, didn’t quite double the seafood and the liquid stayed the same. I added some cayenne to the sauce and a little extra garlic. Delish! The shrimp was over cooked a bit. Next time, I’d wait about 5 minutes and then add the shrimp. Otherwise this is an excellent, healthy meal that’s easy to prepare! Served with rice pilaf and broccolini.

I made this for Valentine's dinner and it was a total hit.  Only a few changes:  couldn't find halibut so I substituted cod and reduced the amount of wine to 1/4 cup.  The shrimp and scallops were done after the designated 10 minutes but the fish was not.  I removed the seafood and kept it warm and cooked the fish for just under 5 more minutes.  Perfection!  This was as good as fine restaurant quality.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this with a buttery Alfredo recipe also on all recipe. This dish was so amazing and easy. A candle lit dinner for my wife after she worked all day and we both were speechless. This is going in the repertoire. Thank you for a great meal, oh Pinot Grigio pairs beautifully with this dish.

I didn't have Old Bay seasoning or Halibut, so I used Tilapia and Creole seasoning. Also the only white wine I had available was a Green Chile white wine, it definitely gave it a different kick and was delicious. I did use a bit of extra wine since there wasn't much left in the bottle so it did have alot of extra juices so it didn't seem to fully cook the fish so I cooked it an extra 3 mins which ended up over cooking the scallops a bit but still good. The shrimp really soaked in the wine. I also added granulated garlic and onion since I didn't feel like mincing anything. I put all the seasoning on the seafood first including the parsley before pouring the wine mixture on, mostly because I didn't fully read the instructions, but still delicious.  Will be making this again!
