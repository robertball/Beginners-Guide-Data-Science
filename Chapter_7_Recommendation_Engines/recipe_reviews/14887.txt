It's a good start...I mean you can't go wrong with a cocktail.  Try adding a jigger or two of gin, vodka, or brandy, (just name your pleasure) then pair up with your favorite taste bud pleasing carbonated splash (tonic or soda). Just because it isnâ€™t the main dish doesn't mean it needs to be bland.Cheers!
