I absolutely LOVED this! I used wasabi powder because that's what was in the cupboard, ground ginger (ditto), and added both a little at a time until it was how I wanted it. Also, I didn't need 1/2c of mayo - just a couple of heaped tbsps. I used the tuna salad to top a couple of split toasted buttered English muffins - the contrasting textures worked extremely well. I really really enjoyed this, and can't wait to make it again for lunch tomorrow! Thanks! (PS, I did indeed make it the next day. I made it into a regular sandwich for husband - on white bread, as recommended - and while he still really enjoyed it, he said it was MUCH better on the toasted muffin. I have to agree!)

This was great Jen! I had wasabi/mayo in the house so I was thrilled to find this little recipe. Different and delicious. Thanks!

Quick and easy. I added jar minced ginger instead(in the fridge), threw it on a salad and sprinkled with rice vinegar as a dressing. Instant healthy lunch! And it helped my sushi craving.

This is a great lower-carb way to enjoy a sushi-like experience.  I concur with Katie B that adding rice vinegar (possibly seasoned, which includes a splash of sugar and salt) makes a nice touch.  Next time I'll try it with pickled ginger for even more authentic sushi taste, a sprinkle of sesame seeds on top (mostly for show) and/or a drizzle of Japanese style spicy-mayo.  Add wasabi slowly, tasting as you go.

Awesome idea!  I didn't use that much mayo and used wasabi paste, some rice vinegar and some soy sauce.  Then I grilled it.  This recipe makes my tuna sandwich so much more exciting!

My boyfriend really wanted to try this, but I don't like tuna! We compromised by using shredded crab instead of tuna.
Another great variation: the same sandwich with melted cheese on top.

This is my new favorite tuna salad...and I eat a lot of tuna!  You can customize it to suit your individual tastes, and it works perfectly for low-carb lettuce wraps!  To make it even simpler, you can buy the Wasabi Mayonnaise at your local grocery store!

Great idea for tuna salad!  Once I got going on it, I made a few changes...

for a double bacth, I used:
2 6oz cans tuna in water, drained
3/4 cup mayo
1 green onion, diced (2-3 tbsp)
1 tbsp wasabi or to taste.
1 tsp canned chopped ginger
2 hard boiled eggs, diced
1/4 cup diced cucumber
2 tsp soy sauce or to taste

Cucumber works well as it is in many different sushi rolls.  I used Japanese soy sauce as it isn't as salty.  I just used 2 packets I had left from the sushi restaurant.  

For Tuna Melt sandwich, lightly toast 2 slices of bread, spread tuna salad on one side, cover with cheese, and place in toaster oven, or 6-8 inches under broiler for 3-5 minutes or until cheese is melted.  Enjoy!

Great Recipe!!  I made a few changes though: I used about 3 TBSP mayo (at most!), 1 tsp sushi soy sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil and 1 stick shredded immitation crab.  For all you low carbers: when served immediately I served it rolled in nori (roasted seaweed paper).  Otherwise the nori would get soggy.  When I brought it to work, I either ate it out of the bowl with shreded nori on top or if I had time I'd make nori/sesame "crakers."  To make these you need: 2 nori sheet, 1/2 cup lightly toasted sesame seeds, 1 egg white and Salt.

Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  
2. Line baking sheet with Parchment paper
3. Cut each nori sheet into 4 squares using scissors.
4. Spread evenly toasted sesame seeds on a flat surface (i.e. a plate or another baking sheet)
5. Place egg white in bowl and beat until foamy but not stiff.
6. Dip 1 side nori sheet into egg white and place on the bed of sesame seeds.
7. Place on the baking sheet with sesame-coated side facing up.
8. Sprinkle lightly with salt
9. Bake for 10 minutes.

As is it still kinda tastes like generic tuna salad, and I absolutely LOVE sushi.  In all fairness, I added pickled sushi ginger instead of fresh.  Not sure if that made a difference.  I will try it again with Japanese salad dressing as another reviewer stated because I do think this one has potential.  Thanks

Different. Whether I will make it again, don't know...but it was good for a change. I added sesame seeds and soy sauce for a little more of a sushi taste.

This was amazing. So much better then regular tuna salad. I used the wasabi paste but I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground. I also added a tiny little bit of soy sauce. Very yummy. I'll be making this a lot. Thanks!

Long overdue enhancement to tuna salad.  Seriously though, start with NO MORE THAN 1/4 CUP of mayo, maybe less.  Better yet, double everything else, but cut the mayo in half.

This was great! I didn't have wasabi or fresh ginger, so I substituted horsradish and ginger paste. I wraped it up in a flatbread wrap, and lunch was ready to go!

This is a great idea, but it definitely could use a little bit of crunch. Finely chopped cucumber, celery, and/or nuts would fit the bill nicely. I took a cue from the picture and served this in Nori rolls with some sushi rice. Will definitely make it again, with some extra veggies thrown in.

I have never in my life liked tuna, but I am a big sushi fan and this salad is incredible! I served mine on lettuce with a drizzle of soy sauce, and used half the wasabi suggested here. Next time I'll add minced avocado or carrots, too. Thanks for this gem!

Great idea! All I had on hand was wheat bread, and it tasted fine to me. Also I used wasabi paste and pickled ginger paste in tubes I had picked up at an international grocer. The green onion adds a nice crispness... better than tuna salads with celery, in my opinion.

I'm giving this five stars because it really just hit the spot. Plus, it is pretty creative, and fast and cheap.
Here are my adjustments:
- Less mayo and used homemade mayo.
- Wrapped into a romaine leaf instead of on bread.
- Didn't have wasabi paste, so used powder and added about a tsp. of yellow mustard powder.
- Added a little white pepper.

Next time I might just try wrapping this in nori with a bunch of julienned veggies. Can't wait to try it with paste (powder didn't have the kick I like)

Enjoy!

Excellent take on tuna salad.  I just made this it was great.  I took it one step further.  I whipped up some salad dressing the type used at Sushi/Japanese restaurants (I used a recipe on this site called "Famous Japanese Restaurant-Style Salad Dressing").  I chopped some lettuce: (I used mixed greens which was all I had and was fine but) iceberg would be most appropriate.  I mixed the chopped celery and the dressing - like a chopped salad- and put it on top of the tuna between two pieces of bread as a true sushi-inspired tuna sandwich.

Loved this!  Quick, easy, and the payoff is great.  I used ground ginger, and I also added soy sauce.  I also cut back on the mayo.  Add the wasabi to taste instead of all at once.  Next time I will get English muffins as suggested.  This takes tuna salad to a new level!

We thought this was wonderful! Found it needed two cans of tuna with the amount of mayo called for. An excellent alternative to our old standby tuna salad recipe.

I don't think I'm going to make another kind of tuna salad again! It's great and it really helps with the sushi cravings. My bf said he liked this better than chicken salad and he's normally more a chicken person than a tuna person!

As is, this recipe is great.  I have also used soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, shrimp sauce....And I've thrown in cucumber, carrot, avocado, and anything else that I put into sushi rolls.  All around, this recipe is good 'as is' or if you want more.  It's just perfect, and I use it a couple times a month.  You've gotta at least give it a shot.

Used freeze dried wasabi powder, made into paste, and ginger juice since I didn't have any other form.  my husband and I both loved it.  he had a sandwich and I had a wrap but worked both ways.  will definitely be making again.  had choc chip peanut butter cookies for dessert. Yumm!!

If you love sushi then absolutely try this.  I used half the mayo this time and will use half the wasabi paste the next time bc the one I bought is really powerful.  Yummy!

An awesome way to jazz up boring old tuna fish.  I am not a fan of onions so I omitted those.  I wanted some crunch still so I just sliced up some cold English cucmbers and used them to dip up the tuna salad.  Yummy with an awesome kick in the nose!

This was really good! My only complaint is that the recipe calls for way too much mayo. Next time I will halve it, at least. I used fat free mayo. I didn't have wasabi, so substituted for horseradish. I also substituted onion powder for the green onions, and ground ginger for the fresh ginger. I was wanting a more Asian taste, so I added a splash of soy sauce, and a splash of rice vinegar. I also added a dash of pepper. I put mine of wheat bread, topped with cheese, and put it on the George Forman for 4 minutes at 400 degrees. It was very good. I think I'll have another for my dinner tonight!

I really enjoyed this.  The usual (tuna with mayo and diced cucumbers) can get kind of boring.  This really spiced up lunch.  I have now made this several times.  Thanks for the idea.

I ate sushi tuna sandwiches with some boiled red potatoes, and I thought it was great. The wasabi was too much for me. Make sure to take it before adding the whole amount.

This was REALLY tasty and beats regular old tuna salad.  I eyeballed the quantities.  I used 4 cans of tuna and between half and 3/4 cup of mayo.  I grated A LOT more fresh ginger in because I couldn't taste it.  2tbsp of wasabi paste seems like a lot for only 2 cans of tuna...I used about that for 4 cans and my husband thought it was too hot.  I also added some rice wine vinegar and diced, seeded cucumber.  I then placed several spoonfuls on nori, along with sticky rice, and rolled it into a burrito.  Served with eggrolls and it was a filling, delicious and easy meal!  Will definitely make again!

Great idea and such a nice change of tuna pace! I used pickled ginger from a jar and used wasabi powder to make a paste, then mixed it with the mayo (as little as possible). I ended up adding wasabi mayo for an extra kick and splashed it with rice vinegar. Turned it into a burrito with nori and then had my BF take a picture of all the seaweed stuck in my teeth... Good stuff.

wow.. talk about tuna salad with a kick! knowing better i added the wasabi paste a little at a time.. i think i stopped at 3/4 tsp.. only used 2 heaping tablespoons of mayo like Caroline C.. halved the green onion and used 1/4 tsp ground ginger for the fresh.. ty for the recipe.. definitely something different.. ~~UPDATE: this time i used pickled ginger and some of the liquid from the jar.. makes me think that some seasoned/sweetened rice vinegar would go great in this as others have suggested.. subbed onion powder for the green onion and cut up some nori into the final product.. threw it into a tortilla and made a wrap out of it.. so good!

I tried this because I had some leftover wasabi from takeout sushi and found this idea to be different. Pretty neat concept, but not a dish that I'll likely try again. But it was worth the effort. Thanks for sharing this one.

Really tasty, but I only used less than 1/2 tsp wasabi paste.  A tbsp would be way too hot!  Added splash of rice vinegar and soy sauce as others suggested. Nice change from regular tuna salad.  Was also good with some fresh ginger.

This was really great. However, I can't imagine a tablespoon of wasabi in one can of tuna. I used less than a teaspoon of wasabi sauce, so I could taste the tuna! Also pickled ginger for the sushi taste and the green onions. Eyeballed the mayo until it was the right consistency. Next time I'll add a little diced celery for crunch and maybe the rice vinegar others suggested. Will definitely make again and again. FOLLOW-UP: Tried the same recipe with a can of salmon; just as good.

This was a very tasty take on tuna salad. I made it because I needed something to serve with an Asian flavored fresh veggie salad I'd made, and this fit my needs exactly. The only changes I made were to use only about a teaspoon of wasabi paste for my husband's tame palate, and dried minced onion, as my husband does not care for raw onion of any kind. I added a stalk of finely diced celery to replace the crunch the scallions would have lent the dish, and it was great. I did make it about 
an hour before service to let the onions rehydrate a little and the flavors meld, and I was very pleased with the results. I'll be making this again.
