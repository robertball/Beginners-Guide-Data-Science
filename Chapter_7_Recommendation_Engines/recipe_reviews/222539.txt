Surprisingly tasty! I'm on a very low fat diet due to gallstones so I've been looking for food with little or no fat. I used egg whites rather than the whole egg but made no other changes to the ingredients. I will using this recipe a lot!

We loved this recipe.  We did swap green peppers for the celery though.  Everything else directly as recipe suggested.  We will be making this a lot!

I thought this was a great basic recipe. I changed it up by using chopped fresh green onions, rosemary, and oregano, and Old Bay seasoning and dusted them with bread crumbs before frying. I also drizzled creamy Sriracha ( mix with a little mayo ) over the top before I served it. Will make them again for sure!

Fast, pleasing to the family, and not expensive, so I'll make them again. I thought I'd "grill" them in the Foreman ... if you have that thought, banish it. They fell apart, despite my tactics to hold them together. I also made them too big, which contributed to the falling-apart situation. Next time, I'll zing them up more with some deeper flavors (maybe curry), and I'll probably shred onion and zucchini and add them. I'll also cook them in a pan as directed and try not to be so clever. All in all, great recipe for a weeknight that uses ingredients I had on hand.

Didn't have celery, so replaced it with green peppers (finely chopped).  Our kids are very particular about what they eat.... Once they took the first bite, they pretty much mowed through them.  They were very delicious and easy to prepare....

My husband does not usually like tuna and I love it. We both really enjoyed these burgers. I made it exactly as listed except using granulated garlic since I ran out of whole. I also cooked them in olive oil. It didn't taste fishy at all!

These were good, but a little bland.  Next time I will try adding some spices for more flavor.

Very tasty.  Used 1/2 cup green onions and a mix of celery and green pepper and a bit of fresh cilantro.  Didn't have any horseradish so used a teensy bit of chopped jalapeno.  Held together nicely and had a little heat.  Will do it again.  I think the basic recipe can be modified to personal taste.  It is lighter than many of the other fish cakes I have made.

No culinary masterpiece, but what do you expect from canned tuna?  It pleased my family, including my two picky sons, and I would make it again.  My sons don't eat mayo, so they put ketchup and cheese on theirs.  Didn't have horseradish, but I added some cumin and chili pepper for a little kick.  Just as the recipe states, this makes four "burgers".  I was worried about the consistency since others claimed they fell apart, but mine held up beautifully.  I will probably double the recipe next time.  My husband went back to kitchen looking for seconds and was disappointed to find an empty plate.

Delicious with a few minor changes. I used crushed saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs,I coated the patties with crushed saltines and I refrigerated the formed patties before cooking. These were so good and a nice alternative to salmon patties. So tasty and easy to assemble and quick to cook.

Loved these!  Even with gluten free bread crumbs, these were juicy and flavorful. Didnt have horseradish on hand. Instead i substituted horseradish mustard.  Tasted great.

Only changes: added diced dill pickles in place of the onion/celery, extra horseradish, and up used gluten free breadcrumbs. Delish!

I added some orange bell pepper to ours, just because I had some and these were delightful!  I halved the recipe because I was only making it for my husband and me and it turned out great (and now I wish I had made the whole thing - ha.)  The horseradish gave it a nice kick and the lemon juice really gave it a fresh taste.  Great because I usually have most of these ingredients on hand so it's a nice, go-to, weeknight dinner.  Thanks!

Very good!  I minced the onions and celery but otherwise followed the recipe.  I didn't make a sandwich; just ate them with salad, mashed potatoes, and peas!

These tuna burgers were quick and savory! I was quite surprised with the way they turned out. We didn't have celery so we substituted green pepper and added celery seed to it. I gave this recipe a 4 because my burgers just about fell apart. I think there needs to be just a slight bit more of some liquid to make sure the ingredients stick together. Otherwise, very good recipe! It's going into the recipe box! Thanks for sharing!

I made it.  I followed the directions exactly.  I used canned Albacore tuna (the only I use).  After combining,  I refrigerated it for a few hours (2-3) .  They stuck together perfectly.  My husband doesn't like horseradish, he loved these.  I will make these over and over.  I'm not a fan of hamburgers, so this is perfect.

These were DELISH!! So quick and easy. I subbed oats for the breadcrumbs (cause we're gluten free) and added some fresh dill because it needed to be used. My 2 yr old ate an entire patty!! It did look like it wasn't going to hold together so I put half the mixture into my blendtec and pulsed it about 5-6 times. It made a better "glue" to hold the patty together. They browned up very nicely and held together! Big win in a toddler household.

This tasted good enough that I would probably make it  again at some point, but I found them fairly bland and would likely increase the horseradish or add other seasonings next time.  I think I'll try tartar sauce instead of mayonnaise with the leftovers to see if this adds more zip.  Also, I should have refrigerated the mixture for a while to bind it before frying.  I had trouble forming patties and keeping them together in the pan.

the best tuna patties I have made so far. I did add a drop or two of Sriracha sauce for added flavor.

Very Good!  A bit more flavorful and cheaper than salmon burgers.  The only change I made was horseradish type mustard since I didn't have any horseradish.  I coated the outside with more bread crumbs seasoned with Old Bay seasoning.  Marilyn

I made the recipe without substitution. I thought the horseradish would be too strong but it was the perfect blend with the garlic and onion. I served it with a homemade tartar sauce. My husband and son loved it!

Maam, you are a danged genius!!! I have not been able to find anything that reminded me so much of my mom's homeburgers since I went pescatarian 4 years ago. My boyfriend and I were just sitting there going "why don't we have these all the time? Why doesn't evert restaurant serve these?" And they're cheap! And proteinacious! And easy! There is nothing not to love!!! :D I did put in a little less celery and a lot more onion, but that's just taste, otherwise these were fantastic and need a medal.

Fortunately I had all the ingredients on hand.  The patties all stuck together and was a healthy dinner at the last minute.  I served with fried yellow squash in same pan.  Yummy!!!!

Delicious!  Loved the hit of horseradish.  Didn't add onions or celery.  Used only 6 TBSP bread crumbs.

I was told to throw away all other recipes I had for Tuna Patties after we had these. The Tuna patties were absolutely incredible!  I always think of Tuna Patties as a last resort, but not anymore.  These could be served in a high-end restaurant.  The only thing I did different was to use 4 eggs instead of 2, which made them a little difficult to handle, but well worth the effort.  I think the added moisture is what made them so juicy, and crisp.  I also used Extra Virgin Olive Oil in a medium high heat to start these off, then reduced the temp to medium, and finished of the other side on high for about a minute.

These are good, and I will make them again!  I didn't have horseradish and used dijon mustard instead.  I'm sure the horseradish is good too.  They stayed together pretty good.
