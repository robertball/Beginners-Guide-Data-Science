My girlfriend was in the mood for Italian, so I made this dish for her. Turned out great! Very important to not break the shells when boiling them and stuffing them.

place your filling in a large ziplock bag and cut off one edge of the bag at the bottom corner. Makes filling these little guys much easier. Food for thought ;)

It was great! Family loved it.  I used hot sausage because we like spice.  Will definitely make it again,

This was very good!!  I made a small change, only because my husband is picky and does not like ricotta cheese.  I substituted the ricotta with a mixture of cream cheese, cottage cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.  It was very rich and my picky husband loved it!!  I will definitely make this again.

I was kind of sketchy of following this recipe's directions or use the directions on the box of the Manicotti. I decided to go with this one. I took the advice of using a plastic bag and cut the tip off. Worked excellent. My bf & I loved them. Thanks for sharing. 4 thumbs up

This recipe was wonderful.  I did use hot Italian sausage as we enjoy spice.  I also added spinach to the sausage mixture.  This is a keeper.

I made this recipe and my boyfriend, his very picky daughter and I ate it up! I didn't have onion on hand so I used dry minced and onion powder and that did the trick. I would advise using a high quality pasta sauce - that was the only thing lacking in mine. I also used 3 cups of sauce total to cover. Prep time, depending on your stuffing technique, can take a while. Mine was about 45 minutes, but very worth it. Like another reviewer, I used spicy Italian sausage for that extra kick!

Very good, a little challenging stuffing the shells but, admittedly that was after several adult beverages. One tip, use double the sauce the recipe calls for.

I had some leftover ricotta I wanted to use and this actually turned out better than my original use for the cheese! A lot easier than I thought it would be to stuff the noodle. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding some spinach in the meat mixture. Very yummy!!

This is absolutely delish!! Only thing was, couldn't find Romano cheese at our neighborhood store so we subbed it with asiago cheese. 2 thumbs up!
