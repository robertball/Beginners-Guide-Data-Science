Hmm maybe it's just my oven, but I think the temperature and cooking time are off on this recipe.  I had my oven at 350 and after 20 minutes the bottoms of these cookies were burnt.  So I lowered the temp to 300 and cooked them for 20 minutes, instead, and they turned out better.

Great taste and easy to make.  I do agree with the temp or cooking time though, mine were turning brown already when I pulled them out with 7 minutes left.  Maybe change the cook time to 15 min or lower the temp to 300 for 20 min.

This desert is fun and very tasty but I found it difficult to melt the chocolate without burning it in the pan or microwave.  I also found the recommended oven temp to be too high but that is easily fixed.  Very very yummy though.

Did not need to bake these for 25 minutes. They were done in about 15 when the edges started to brown. I have to say that these cookies are incredibly good but oh so odd. When they came out of the oven I ate one warm and it was so gross I was gonna toss them all out. I did end up icing them a bit, truly, just to take a photo, but then my husband ate one and said it was so good it tasted like candy. I ate a cool, frosted one and I am addicted. We ate them all. Odd little cookie but really I do recommend them.

I had problems with this recipe.  Chocolate would not melt, the dough was runny...so runny that I had to put it in mini muffin tins.  Despite that, people still thought they were good!

The flavor combo on these sounded good so we gave them a shot. I like to be creative so instead of almonds I used marzipan paste. I tried melting it together with the chocolate unexpectedly it turned into a dough, it tasted great though. We went ahead and crumbled it and folded it as directed. 
Cooked on 300 for 15 min. and they were perfect. Not really a stack but they are awesome. 
Next time I will probably try just mixing the chips in unmelted and using almond extract.

Not the best, they came out thick and pretty much tastless, I thought I was cooking them to long because the bottoms were burnt, but they were actually better going longer.

The only problem I had with this recipe was the cooking time. I baked them for 15 min and they turned out much better. :) Also the trick to melting the chocolate in the microwave is to only use 50% power for one min then stir. It will not look melted but once you stir for a while it will become more of a liquid.
