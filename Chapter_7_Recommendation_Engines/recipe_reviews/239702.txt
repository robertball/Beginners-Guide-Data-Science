good in a pinch, makes a very quick pizza sauce but the taste is just okay.  I use this often because it is better than serving a store bought option and extremely fast.

Really good, has a great flavor. It is on the sweeter side, but not too much so. If you prefer savory with no sweet, leave the sugar out.

Really nice flavor! I never like store bought pizza sauce; it tastes funny and I always avoid homemade pizza because I don't want to put the fake sauce on it. This solves that problem and only costs as much as the tomato sauce...a whole .69. Definitely a keeper.

Works perfect.   Ready in 5 minutes.  I use San Marzano for an even fresher taste.

Way too sweet for me.  Unless you like sweet sauce,  use approximately 1/2 teaspoon sugar.

I made it as recipe directed. It was easy, fast and delicious. I have made this about 6 times now. I tried once to change it a bit and it turned out bad. So as is I will make this repeatedly.

Flavorful, quick sauce. My son said it was "better than take-out"! It really was very good, easy, & quick to make. I made 2 pizzas so I doubled the recipe. Made a standard pepperoni for my son which he devoured. Made a roasted chicken & veggie for me. Loved it & had left overs. Just as flavorful left over!

Get the kids involved with this one. Easy to make and use on English muffins or pizza dough. This sauce is rich in flavor.
