This is the recipe we love. It's much better than the ones out there that include pudding mixes!  We think this is much healthier and rises better!

I made several versions of amish friendship bread and this was the one that everyone loved.  It's hard to please everytone - which consists of 6 kids and a husband.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe

This recipe is far better and healthier than the original friendship bread.  I substituted some of the white flour for whole wheat and grated the apples and nuts to make them more acceptable to my children.  It makes a very moist and delicious breakfast or snack.

I enjoyed this recipe. I made two changes; I omitted the nuts as my boyfriend is allergic. I also substituted pumpkin puree for the oil. The bread did get brown long before the inside was done; 40 minutes in I turned the temp down to 325 and gave it another 15 minutes to cook it all the way through. The taste is great though, just the right amount of cinnamon and apples. UPDATE: Made this again, using the exact ingredients as the recipe states. I put some in muffin tins and they took about 15 minutes to bake.

This was my first attempt with making friendship bread and I decided to use this recipe with my starter that was given by a neighbor. What a wonderfully, delicious cake like bread. I chose to make this in 1 Bundt pan rather than making two loaves. I added just a sprinkling of nutmeg to the batter. Then I sprinkled with confectionary sugar after baking. Baking time in the Bundt pan took 45-50 minutes at the 350 degrees. I set my timer to check with a cake tester 5 minutes earlier to help prevent drying out and over baking.  My first slice I tried plain, loved it. The second slice I tried with peanut butter. YUMMY! This bread went perfectly with a cup of coffee. I decided to send a sample slice of this bread and recipe to the people I pass the starter onto. After trying this recipe, I decided to keep a starter for myself and start over, so I can make this bread again and also freezing a starter to use at a later time. For those that don’t have the starter, you can find the recipe for “Amish Friendship Bread Starter” here at All Recipes.

Great Great Bread, except I had to use 3/4 of my batter just to get the bread tall enough.  This recipes needs to be adjusted for that fact.  It's never tall enough, unless you use most of your batter on one loaf instead of two.
I used applesauce also and threw some mashed bananas in.  Very Moist and Yummy!!  I reduced temp to 325, to risk browning prematurely,  Looks perfect!

To: KIJEST, 
Perhaps your oven is hotter than normal, I used to get "burned" Amish friendship bread and breads in general because my ovens thermostat was going bad and couldn't regulate my oven properly. I replaced it and used this recipe again for the full 50 minutes, it turned out perfect!

Excellent bread! Family loved it. Kids thought it was great fun to make and eat. Loved it with peanut butter spread on it after school. Husband enjoyed it toasted.

This was fabulous!  Being diabetic I do try to "fiber up" all my recipes, so my starter was made with Oat Flour.  I continued with the Oat flour into this recipe, cut the oil to 1/3 cup and used 1/3 cup of applesauce also.  Additionally I have been using the Brown Sugar Splenda Blend to cut the carbs down and you only need 1/2 cup of that to replace the full cup of white sugar.  This bread came out like a super fiber rich moist healthy oatmeal muffin with the apples and nuts, really delicious!

This is fantastic!  I especially love the crust on it!  This is such a great base recipe for any kind of nut, fruit, flavored chips, etc.  I expected more of a yeast loaf, but the recipie is actually like a quick bread loaf, but oooohhhh sooo wonderful!

This is a great version for friendship bread.  I love the apples and cinnamon combination.  This recipe also has a lot less sugar than other friendship bread recipes and doesn't require pudding mix, which I rarely have on hand.  My family thinks the bread is a real treat.  I put one loaf in the freezer while we eat the other one as breakfast.

This is an absolutely delicious way to use up the starter.  Very rich and flavorful cake.  I made it as written but leaving out the nuts as the kids aren't crazy about them.  My whole family loved this bread/cake, and it's even better after the first day.  I made it in a Bundt pan and it took exactly 50 minutes to bake.  I'm going to double the cinnamon next time to try it as a spicier bread, but it's delicious as written, too.  Thanks!

I used whole wheat flour for half of the all purpose flour, increased the cinnamon and omitted the nuts.  It was awesome.  I only had one bread pan so I put the rest in a muffin pan.  Awesome.  Love what the granny smith apples do for the taste.  Decrease the amount of time for the muffins.

Delicous! Only gave it 4 stars because I modified it. Made it a bit healthier: 1 C whole wheat flour & 1 C self rising (therefore omitted baking powder & baking soda), only used 2 eggs, added 2/3 C applesauce, 1/3 C oil, used maple extract, cinnamon & nutmeg for flavoring. Everything else the same  Out of this world delicious & moist!! Made an 8x8 square plus 20 mini muffins.

This is an excellent recipe and I got raving remarks for it from my family. A good way of using up my apples too.The only extra thing that i did was, I sprinkled my loaf pan with 2T sugar and 1tsp cinnamon, placed it in mid-lower rack, and baked it for 50-53 minutes. I like the edges to be dark and crispy.

I just made my first loaf of Amish Friendship Bread with my first try at a Amish Friendship Starter.  I followed a recipe I found here for starter and it's great.  I think it will be even better as the starter matures, becomes a little bolder, but I love the soft taste of this bread.  I pulled the loaf (I only have one 9x5" pan, so I used an 11x13".  Shaped like a cake, but whatever.  I'll get a second tomorrow!) and shared a piece with my husband and brother in law.  We all had our eyes popping out of our heads.  I didn't have vanilla extract and I added a tad more cinnamon, because I love it.  Again, it's awesome! And I feel good about experimenting with it.

Cooking wise, this turned out great. I followed the recipe exact. I was was a little concerned that they might be a little too heavy, as the batter was really thick, but it turned out just fine. I covered both loaves with tinfoil halfway through to prevent the tops from burning. Smelled wonderful. I won't be sampling these myself, as these will be Christmas gifts that I'm freezing until that time, but I'll update when I hear how good they were. This recipe made two regular sized loaves and took me about an hour and twenty minutes to bake fully.

This is soooo good! I replaced most of the oil with applesauce, used only one apple(with the peel on), and also added 2 cups of raisins and chopped dates (a cup each).  I only used half the walnuts as well.  The bread rose a little more than I expected and was moist enough.  Very very good!

These were a little heavy and didn't rise very well.  I used two 8x4 pans but could have just used one, they came out so short.  They overcooked--dry inside and too dark on the outside so maybe next time I'll lower the oven temp or take them out sooner.  They weren't as flavorful as I remember from the Amish friendship bread we used to make in college, like maybe it needs more spice or something.  I'll try it again (have to use up the rest of the starter!) and see if I can get it to where I like it.

I liked the concept of this -- no pudding mix like other Amish bread recipes -- but I found it way too sweet. If I make it again, I'll cut the sugar way back to probably only 1/3 a cup. It was very moist though, and everyone else seemed to gobble it up. The loaves were quite large. I baked them in pyrex pans.

Fantastic recipe.  I did not make any changes to the recipe and it turned out great.  There are a lot of variations for Amish Friendship Bread, but this is my family's favorite.

This is THE best bread ever.  The apples make it utterly delicious!  I used 2 tsp of cinnamon and omitted the nuts. I made this for my husband's 96 year old grandmother and she said I had to bring more when we visited - she never asks for anything!

This was a big hit!  I thought two apples was going to be too much but it was great!  Perfect blend of cinnamon and not too sweet.  I used Granny Smith Apples.

I obtained some of the starter, and the recipe that the bag came with had instant pudding in it. I don't think the Amish use instant pudding! This sounds good, so I think I will use this instead.

I adjusted the spices to my liking (nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger) and used pureed apples minus the core but including the peeling which added some fibre and a bit of color.  The flavor was great but I found the loaf didn't raise much.  I used two pans but probaby could have put all the batter in one pan for a higher loaf.
