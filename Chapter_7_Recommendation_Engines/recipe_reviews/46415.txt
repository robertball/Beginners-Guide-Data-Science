This was so delicious - I put two cans Frank's sweet sauerkraut, 3# country ribs, about 12/15 little red potatoes, a large onion, and a can of Coke - left it for about 8 hours on low in the crockpot - Oh, yum yum - everything was so good!  Can't wait to make it again

I stumbled on to this recipe and was hesitant at first, but this is a great way to make sauerkraut!! Before I would fry it like my Mom did with onions and a little garlic then I added some brown sugar to it or I would bake it with the pork roast, but this recipe beats the other ways by far!  So simple and has a great taste, my husband really goes "bananas" when I make this with pork roast!!  The flavor is just great!
This recipe replaces Mom's.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Reminds me of growing up and having sauerkraut and weiners :-) ... only better. The butter and onions were the real kicker. I also threw in a dash of balsamic vinegar, 2 tblsp brown sugar, and a polish sausage cut into 1/2" slices. Wonderful blend of sweet and tangy. Great one-dish meal served with warm pumpernickel bread and sweet honey butter. DELICIOUS!

Great side dish for pork dinners!  Much more interesting and tasty than plain saurekraut.  It was a big hit in my household - and very easy to prepare.  To cut down on calories I used half the amount of butter indicated and it didn't seem to make a difference.

Mmmmmm good! I made this in our slow cooker with a couple modifications:
Drained the sauerkraut, added a 12 oz. package of fresh mushrooms quartered and 1# of frozen polish kielbasa cut into 3" chunks. My fiance said it was the best sauerkraut I've ever made for him....even better than my German mom's recipe! Thanks!

Any recipe that starts with a whole stick of butter ought to have something going for it, right?  Excellent - and it got the approval of my Slovak/Ukranian grandmother - a woman who knows her sauerkraut!

We added in smoked sausage dogs, and eat this on toasted hotdog buns. Out of a family of 6, 4 out of 6 enjoyed it. But hey, the two that didn't think it was wonderful, was my 2 youngest, ages 10, and 12. But Mom was in the mood for kraut, and when Mom cooks, you will at least try what Mom makes! LOL ;)

If you don't like cooked cabbage you're probably not going to like this recipe. I used my divided crockpot, to see which way the sauerkraut was better:  rinsed or rinsed w/ some of the juice ( and a little less Coke) added back in.  I think the extra juice made a more complex sweet pickle-like taste & was definitely better.

This stuff is really yummy! I made it for dinner tonight and can't stop picking at the leftovers. I used Diet Coke and it had just the right amount of tang. I wasn't sure from the recipe if I was to drain the kraut or not so I did (drain it) and found that it was just right. Such a nice color too. I served it over mashed potatoes which is customary here and it was a real hit. Will definitely play with it by adding bacon or pork or sausage. A really good recipe.

When I was a kid I used to ask for sauerkraut and weinies for my birthday meal, so needless to say, I 've always loved 'kraut!  This was the best 'kraut recipe I've ever tasted! The only changes I made was using Diet Coke I added sliced grilled brauts in the last 20 minutes.  Phenomonal meal!!!

I enjoyed this. Being the only one in my home who will eat sauerkraut I halved the recipe. I added kielbasa in the last 15 minutes to make this a complete meal. I added a splash of white wine vinegar which cut the sweetness from the cola. I like it tangy. Thanks for a nice meal.

This was a great, great, great recipe. Although, I added a small amount of dillseed and cut back on the butter. It went well with pork loin as well as fresh bratwurst that my grandfather made from hogs that he raises on his farm in Indiana. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys kraut or has farm raised swine.

Great recipe!  It was the best part of dinner!  I also used Diet as it was all I had and added a Tablespoon or so of brown sugar.  Not sure it was necessary.  I would use the recipe just as written!

I've made bar-b-que sauce with cola before so thought this sounded interesting.  I prefer a sweet sauerkraut and this was perfect after I added 1/4 cup brown sugar. To reduce salt, rinse the kraut several times and wring out excess moisture before preparing. To make this into a whole meal, add cut up potatoes and sliced smoked keilbasa while cooking. It was yummy!

I give this 3 stars only because as another reviewer mentioned the cola take the bite or "sourness" out of the kraut.  That was a disappointment as I do like that aspect of sauerkraut.  It did not taste bad though.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who does not like the sauer in sauerkraut. I probably won't make it again this way, but at least I can say I tried it.

This was the first time my DH got on here to find a recipe and he found this because we were looking for a side dish using sauerkraut. This was the best sauerkraut I've ever eaten. We were not too sure because of the coke but thought we would try it anyway since we had it all on hand. It is a keeper and will be put on weekly rotation! Thank you Thank you! Also to others not too sure, just try it.

I made this with a spicy venison roast and potatoes and it made the meal!  My sauerkraut-obsessed boyfriend was very tentative about me "messing with the kraut" but he LOVED it!!!  Very good the next day also!

It is really good.  It is definitely more mild than standard sauerkraut by adding the cola.  My 4 year old ate it even.  I would have given it a 5 star actually but only did 4 because someone who LOVES Sauerkraut might miss the standard punch it usually has. If I were rating it for someone who does not like the really sour taste though... would give it a 5 star.  Worth trying and seeing what you think.  Would use less butter in the future though.  Was good but not necessary.

Normally, I would have heated up a can of sauerkraut and maybe tossed in some chopped onions and a bit of beer.  I can't imagine cooking sauerkraut any other way now.  I did add about a Tablespoon of Carraway seed.  Loved it.  Thanks!

Excellent.  Something about the cola takes the bite out of the kraut.  I will fix this often as a side dish.  My 9 year old daughter didn't try it until after our meal was over, while we were cleaning up.  She took several bites of the leftovers from the pan and said if there would have been enough, she would have sat down and ate a whole bowl.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and I cut down on the unhealthy saturated fat by just using a TBSP of real butter and a TBSP of Heart Smart spread and it still tasted great.

To sweet, To sweet, To sweet, Hence the name "sauer" kraut.. I like my sauerkraut sour.. I don't want it to taste like a candy bar... All I could taste was sweetness. It ruined the whole pot.  Not a good recipe...I followed the recipe exactly.. that is too much sweetness.  sorry. No Good!!

Adds just a little sweet to sauerkraut. I directed a friend to this recipe and I think she makes it once a week. Super simple and tasty!

It was okay, but I wouldn't wade the river for it.  I like my kraut to have some bite to it - this just didn't.

This was great.  I did modify a little...I started out with margerine and sauted the onions until translucent, then I added real bacon bits as well as black pepper. I added the sauerkraut and diet cola with a large pinch of white sugar.  After a few moments of simmering I added a 1/2 teaspoon of dried red peppers to perk it up a little bit. Everyone enjoyed it with their pork roast.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I only used 1/2 the amount of butter. I chopped up a couple pieces of bacon and sauted it with the butter and onions. I only added an 8 oz can of soda because I only ever buy the "baby" cans. I also added about a tsp. of caraway seed. I really liked it. My husband liked it as well. I don't know that I would use this on reubens or brats though.

I wrote that about 4 hrs. ago. My husband just reheated some and said it's even better after it's had time for the flavors to come together.

This was ok, if you like your kraut on the sweet side.  As it turns out, we do not.

My mom has been making this sauerkraut for years, it is so good. I cook it down pretty much all day and sometimes throw in a diced up apple if I've got one on hand. This goes great with the apple glazed pork tenderloin off this site.

Very very good. Brought to a neighborhood bbq with grilled hot dogs and everybody loved. I'm not even a sauerkraut fan and I liked it too.I read through other reviews first. I used only 1/2 the butter called for, used diet pepsi and threw in some fennel seeds and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Make sure you drain and rinse the the sauerkraut.

I love sauerkraut, but I didn't love this.  If I made it again I would only use enough butter to cook the onions in.  I did not like the butter taste.

Sorry but we did not care for this.  The recipe didn't specify whether to drain and rinse the sauerkraut and maybe that would've helped.  I usually make my sauerkraut with an apple and some brown sugar, so I will try making those additions to this dish and see if we enjoy it more.  Thanks anyway.

I'll give this recipe 5 stars with the addition of my husband's changes.  It is a great recipe to cut the tart flavour of the sauerkraut.  We made 3L of sauerkraut and added 1/2 lb of crumbled bacon and about 3/4 cup chopped leftover ham and one grated potato.  The resulting flavour was a bit too mild and we added a couple Tbsp of balsamic vinegar as others have suggested.  Great!

very good. I am giving it a 4 because of the changes. Only needed one 14oz can as it was PLENTY. Added the tbs apple cider vinegar and the caraway seeds per other reviewers. And a pinch of sugar. Turned out great. Served with Knackwurst and german potato salad. Yum!

Way better than just plain Saurkraut! I used a 24 oz. jar of Saurkraut, which I now think I should have drained prior to using in this recipe. I used 1/8 cup butter, one chopped onion, and one can of beer. Then I tasted it and it needed a kick, so I added about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. I'll be eating this with corned beef sandwiches and loving it.

Made it exactly as directed except I added 2 T brown sugar (mostly for color I guess). I could've eaten the entire dish by myself...and I'm not a lover of sauerkraut...or wasn't until this recipe! Loved it, as did all my guests!

Tried this with my spicy sausage, kraut, and potatoes dish, and it was wonderful.  My husband has requested that I make it this way from now on.  Great recipe!

I was looking for a kraut recipe with a twist for St. Patty's day. Thanks for this one! It's great. I'll used it again-- i used kraut from a local deli, but that was the only sub. Came out, rich, tangy, a little sweet. The color is suspect at first but you forget about what it looks like once you eat it. This has a lot of butter so I may try to edit the butter down a little bit next time.

This is a keeper.  I've used this recipe a number of times and always get great comments and am asked for the recipe.  At times, depending on what I'm serving with it I've added bacon and more onion.  Even my grandkids love it.  Thanks Drew.

Sorry- this took a long time and the taste was off and I'm European so I'm used to sauerkraut. I just wanted to try a different recipe. I'll just sit to frying it
Thanks anyway...

I l-o-v-e sauerkraut, so when I came across this recipe, I had to give it a shot. I didn't change a thing, except the number of servings, since I was the only one eating this. It doesn't taste much different to me, so I'm guessing it's one of those recipes where the flavor comes through the following day as leftovers. Regardless, this is a keeper. Thanks!

I thought it was good but nothing to brag about.  I added some brown sugar and that seemed to help a bit.  Could have probably had the same result if I just cooked sauerkraut with small amount of butter and just the brown sugar.  Probably will not make again.

This recipe is the greatest! I have only had sauerkraut a few times but with this  recipe I will be adding it to the menu a lot more often. I did follow others advice and add a Tbsp of sugar and a shot of vinegar. Next time I might cut back on the butter but this was still excellent!

This was so easy and the taste was wonderful - very subtle.  The only change I made was to add a tbls. of sugar as one reviewer suggested.  I served it with chipatole crusted pork tenderloin (on this site).  There is quite a bit left over so I will make a kielbasa tomorrow and serve the rest with that!  Thanks submitter - this is a keeper!

This recipe really took me back to when I was growing up with my Lithuanian Grandma cooking pork roasts. I was never able to authenticate her sauerkraut until this recipe. I rinsed the brine very well from the sauerkraut first as I try to watch my sodium consumption. I did not cook the sauerkraut in the liquid the whole time, but drained it after it heated through about fifteen minutes and then added to my pork roast with kielbassi. The flavor was excellent, I also added some carway seeds to the kraut. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

Scaled in half. Very good.  Cut back on the butter and the cola. Added some caraway seeds.  Still had a "sauer"  taste with just a hint of sweetness. Perfect on a reuben sandwich.  Delish!!!!!

Excellent! I was aprehensive but figured this recipe was better than eating the kraut plain. I'm glad I tried it - it was delicious! Per other reviews I used Coke zero and added brown sugar.

Possibly my fault, but I didn't like this recipe.  Being from Texas, I used Dr. Pepper (no Coke on hand).  It just wasn't very good.  I don't think the use of Coke would change my mind about this recipe, though.

Kind of sweet for me as I usually do the dill version of sauerkraut but it was good nevertheless. I used just a dab of butter. My conscience couldn't let me do more.

I had a dinner party and served this.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I added a little sugar, only because I prefer it a little on the sweet side.  I will be serving this one again!  It is very easy to prepare.  By the way, I am not a sauerkraut lover, but this was great!

excellent. I was so surprised. the whole family loved it. I like it a little tangier, so i had a cruet of vinegar and just a few drops made it perfect. Good job Drew.
