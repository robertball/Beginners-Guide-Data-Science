This was bad...none liked it.  It was anything but creamy.  Tasted like semi baked cornbread with corn in it.  I followed the directions exactly and certainly baked it long enough.

This is somewhat quiche like.  I enjoyed it.  When I make it again I will add some salt and more cheese.  Probably shredded cheddar or colby jack.

I used cream corn and only 1/4 cup of milk and didn't drain the cream corn.  I was searching for a recipe using corn meal and not a cornbread mix, I will make this again
