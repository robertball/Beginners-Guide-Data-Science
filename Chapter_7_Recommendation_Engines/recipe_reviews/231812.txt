Used my own homemade ranch dressing and my peppers were quite hot, so only used three of them. My son didn't want the Parmesan cheese in his and so I made mine with and left it out of his. My son's tasted much better, I love Parmesan but it just didn't mesh well with the chipotle flavor for me, so I'll omit that next time. I did add in a chopped celery and that was really a nice addition. My son said it was the best tuna sandwich he ever had.

I followed the recipe exact EXCEPT I omitted the dijon mustard (I just happened to be out and didn't know until I was already making the recipe) and I used my own homemade ranch dressing. This was one of the best tuna salads I've made in a while.

Wonderful! I never would have thought of using chipotle in tuna salad. Great way to use up the rest of a can of chipotle in adobo. Thanks!

I really liked the chipotle peppers in this! But, all ranch dressing was not very good to me. Also, it was too many onions for my taste. I made just 1 can of tuna, so I made another batch with mayonnaise in place of ranch and no onions, and then I added the two batches together. I will make this again, but I will use half ranch, half mayo and half the onions. I also added some celery for more texture.

this was alright.. i subbed chipotle sauce (1 T per each pepper), peppercorn style ranch, and spicy brown mustard.. i felt like something was missing after i tasted the finished product so i added some small diced celery and cilantro.. which really helped
