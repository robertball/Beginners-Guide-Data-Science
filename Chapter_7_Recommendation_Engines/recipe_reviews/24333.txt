I have made this at least a dozen times, and it gets rave reviews from my guests.  I do modify it by:
use about 6 slices of jalapenos (the kind sold in small jars) and mince them very fine.  This adds the hot flavor but it's still mild enough for even kids to eat.  I also use only 1/2 cup butter, and I omit the cheddarcheese from the sauce (which may be what keeps mine from having too much sauce and being mushy, which was a problem for other reviewers.)  I sprinkle the top of the corn/sauce mixture w/ bacon bits and plain bread crumbs, and then sprinkle about half a cup cheddar on top.  I just had a friend call me for the recipe for her Christmas dinner, which reminded me that I never reviewed it.  Another tip that works well with this recipe:  buy cream cheese and throw it into the freezer so you always have it on hand for this recipe.  It makes no difference at all in the dish.  I've used frozen cream cheese in other saucy recipes and it works fine, but I don't recommend it for frostings.

I would rate this even higher.  We love corn and this is a new definite keeper.  I followed others suggestions and cut the butter, cream cheese and milk in half and it was plenty.  Also followed another reviewers advice and mixed half of the cheddar cheese into the corn and then added the rest to the top.  I will continue to make it this way.  It was perfect for us.  Oh, even though we like spicy - I did cut back a wee bit on the peppers - it seemed like a a lot.

This is really good! I took it to a buffet, and it was all eaten. I used a can of chopped green chilis and a 4-oz jar of chopped pimientos instead of the jalapenos. BUT the most important thing is that there is just too much sauce. The second time I made it, I made only half the sauce, and it worked MUCH better. I also mixed half the cheese into the corn before baking it.

The hot corn was a huge hit at the company Thanksgiving party! I had tons of people ask for the recipe. I did however make a few modifications. I added just one package of low-fat cream cheese, 1/2 cup half-and-half, several American cheese slices (to cover the top), 3/4 cup of cooked bacon bits, bunch of green onions chopped and 1/2 green pepper chopped. I Of course also added the corn (3 bags of frozen) and a jar of jalapenos! :) I ended up cooking mine in the crock pot on low for about 2.5 hours before the event.

This is awesome! The only change I would make is to use only 1/2 cup of butter. It was too greasy I think with one full cup. I also used 1/2 jalapenos and 1/2 green chiles to cut down on the heat. Very good.

This was really tasty, but cut the sauce in half or it's way too saucy.

I am rating this recipe a 5, but with the following changes: I don't add jalepenos because I don't care for them. Also, I use 60 oz. frozen corn instead of canned (b/c I prefer the flavor). I also add some garlic powder b/c otherwise it's bland. I mix about half the cheese into the sauce, and then pour over the corn. You have to work fast with the frozen corn because the sauce will clump quickly. I then add the rest of the shredded cheese and bake. So yummy!

THis recipe was great.  I used green chilies instead of jalapeno's so it wasn't to hot.  I will definitely make again.  I would suggest using less cream cheese though.

I have made something similar to this forever, except add some raw scrambled eggs, bake it till the egg sets, top with croutons and some more cheese. it takes it to a whole new level.  And to turn this into an entr√©e, I have added shredded chicken, and also shrimp.

This was really yummy. I gave it four stars cause I used the original and tweaked it using what I had on hand (couldn't wait to go to the store before trying it!) when I made a small tester batch (about 1/4 sized) for my husband and myself. I used an 11 oz. can of chipotle flavored corn, 1 fresh jalapeno, diced, about 3T cream cheese, 1 1/2T 2% milk, 1 1/2T butter, and 1/4c cheddar. I saut√©ed the jalape√±o in the butter until soft, about three minutes, turned the heat down low and tossed in the cr. ch and milk, stirring to melt, then added the corn and 1/2t cumin and 1/4t salt. I dumped it into a small casserole and topped with the cheese, and baked at 375 for about 10 minutes. Delicious! Can't wait to try it again with the ingredients as listed. I bet this will be a big hit at my choir picnic. Thanks!

I got so may compliments at Thanksgiving for this. Which was good because it was the first time I had ever brought anything to my hubby's family Thanksgiving! Whew! Maybe just add a little less liquid, it was a little juicy, but soooooo delicious! Will make again for sure!

This is the best corn recipe ever! Next time I will use less butter. Kids won't like this because it is very hot - maybe because I did not remove the seeds in the jalapenos. I made it for a party and I will make it for Christmas.  It is the best !

This is a great recipe and I've been making it for years.  The only change I make is omitting the canned corn and using frozen corn.  I think canned corn is mushy and tastes like the can.  It's much, much better if you use frozen corn and don't overcook it.  It always disappears quickly and I've shared it with lots of friends and family members.

We made this for the 1st time last night. We scaled the recipe back to 4 servings and used fresh garden corn. It's a nice change to boring, plain corn. Next time, I think I'll just spend a lil more time "smoothing out" the cream cheese, for better presentation. I added fresh jalapenos and red pepper for color. I believe this Is Worth trying again.

I loved this recipe, and it has been a big hit with family and friends.  I did read other reviews and agree you need to cut the butter, cream cheese, milk and cheddar cheese, I used 3 cans of corn and half the other ingredients and it was perfect.  Otherwise it is too greasy.  Wonderful side dish to any meal.

I totally forgot to take a picture but this was pretty good. Not like OMG I have to make it everyday. I'm thinking maybe adding a can of green chilies next time, it just seemed it was lacking something. It did taste like a jalapeno popper which I love. I'll make this again. Update: Tried this with a can of rotel and it was about the same taste.

For something so simple, this really is good, especially if you love corn. I used 1 can, and 1/2 bag of roasted corn (Trader Joe's)- delish. I cut back a bit on the butter and cream cheese, just until I had the consistency I was looking for. I used it to top chicken enchiladas, where it balanced out nicely the whole wheat tortillas I used. I can see lots of uses for this- layered dips (add spinach!), top spicy meat or fish, dollop into chilis, stews, chowders...

This was OK.  Not great but not bad.  I'll probably save my cream cheese for a recipe I like better in the future.

This recipe is certainly better using frozen corn rather than canned.  I just steamed the frozen corn for a couple of minutes first.

It is just OK.  Will I make this again?  NO.  I think it would be better with just a little butter and the peppers....nothing more.  I like simplicity.  Why cover up the taste of perfectly good vegetables?

I honestly hadn't planned to look for a corn recipe but while browsing I discovered this one.  Thought what the heck and added another vegetable to our family meal yesterday.  We had 21 people and all but 3 raved, and raved about it.  I cut back on the peppers some afraid it would be too hot but was told to add more next time.  I have never had so many compliments over a vegetable before.  It presents like it is terribly hard to make and was one of the easiest on the menu.  My son in laws always come with take home containers in hand and were most distressed there were no leftovers to take home!

this was GREAT!  had it for thanksgiving.  my father who doesn't eat corn, and definately doesn't like spicy stuff had at least 4 servings that i saw, and my sister-in-law that is very hard to impress asked for the recipe.  it was a bigger hit than everything else...and everything turned out great!  writing about it is making me hungry for it again.  :-)

Our family thought this recipe was great.  I did everything exactly as instructed however, when I went to open the jalapenos, turns out it was green chiles instead.   As a result, it wasn't hot at all.  So for all those that thought it was too hot, try chopped green chiles instead of jalapenos.  I did follow the recommendation and put half the cheddar cheese in with the corn & topped with the remaining cheese along with plain bread crumbs & bacon bits which gave it a little crunch.

Excellent!  But I did take other reviewers suggestions and cut the sauce recipe in half or else it would have been too much sauce.  I used a bag of frozen corn, just personal preference, and a dash of salt and pepper.  I didn't have jalape√±os on hand, so I used a can of diced green chilis.  Just as good!

Tasty, but cut the butter from 1 cup to a 1/4 cup, otherwise the corn drowns in butter. Seriously, your heart will thank you.

Used frozen corn because it's better than watery canned.  Steamed it until the frost was off.  Set the butter and 1 pkg. of cream cheese atop until they melted.  Used the full cup of butter because corn and butter were made in heaven for each other.  Left the milk out: cream cheese was creamy enough.  Added salt and pepper as the frozen corn had none.  Chopped a few slices of jalapeno from a jar.  Used the full 2 cups of sharp cheddar.  One pan.  No fuss.  Result was pretty good.  Will eat some more in a day or so.  If I ever make it again, will cut the butter in half at least.  Too much of a good thing.

This is the best recipe I have found in a while that has to do with Mac n cheese and I have to say my family makes me make it at least 1 time every week.  It's awesome for those cold days when you want to just sit on the couch and read or watch movies.  It's a really good recipe and I would recommend it to EVERYBODY if you haven't tried it please do you won't regret it

I took the advice of others and cut down the cream cheese to one package and the butter to just a 1/2 cup. I don't like things too spicy, so I used green chiles instead of jalapenos.

My husband and I both loved this corn recipe! My husband even said this was the best corn he's ever eaten. I will definitely be making again. I didn't add the cheddar cheese because I didn't have any, but it was perfect without.

Love this! I've made this a few times over the years for potluck dinnerssince I first stumbled upon it on allrecipes.com. The *only* change I made was using chopped green chiles in place of jalapeno peppers. I always come home with an empty dish! :)

Maybe I shouldn't have substituted fresh jalepenos for the ones is the jar-- this was crazy HOT!  I liked it-- I like hot things-- but my husband couldn't handle the heat.  It was okay but not really what I was hoping for.  It was very creamy and heavy- more of a casserole than a veggie dish.  I might try it again but probably not.

I halved the recipe and it was ok but the texture wasn't something that appealed to us. We couldn't put our finger on it but it just tasted too mushy. It was spicy though.

This is very good corn recipe.  I made it for the first time in October for a family gathering and it was a big hit for those that liked really hot things.  However, for my husband and I, it's a little too hot.  I'm making it again for Thanksgiving, but I'm decreasing the amount of jalapenos.

I take it to parties all the time and its always a favorite. I kick it up by adding extra fresh diced jalapeno and even fresh habanero for the proper kick :-) I always have to bring it with a disclaimer on it when I do that that, but people still can't get enough.

I only used one cream cheese and added 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 tsp of both garlic powder and onion powder. I put it all in a crock pot on high for 2 hours. Took it to a  block party and was lucky to get to try it. Keeper for sure!

This recipe is easy and delicious recipe and take in corn. Made it for my office potluck and it was a hit. I did check reviews and took some advice shared. The following changes were perfect. The sauce was perfect with 1/2 the measurements. I can't imagine how soupy it would have been had I used the amount that's written. I used low fat milk, low fat organic cream cheese and vegan butter which was good. I also wanted to control the heat so I used fire roasted diced chili's  (8 oz.) & 1/4tsp of cayenne pepper. It was just enough. Mild cheddar was mixed in as well as sprinkled on the top. I will definitely try it again...no dairy and see how that tastes.

I used kernels from 4 ears of leftover grilled corn and added frozen corn.  I only used half a recipe of the sauce and chopped two frozen jalapeno peppers.  It was so delicious!  I will make it again!

I thought this was delicious.  Since there was just two of us, I
halved the recipe.
Also took advice of other raters and added half the cheese in the corn and the remainder sprinkled on top.

I served this at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Like others recommended I cut the sauce in half.  I used sharp cheddar and added half to the sauce and half on the top.  Because there were seniors in my crowd, I used about 1/3 of the jar of jalapenos and it was just the right amount of spice.  I will definitely be making this again!

I have made this many times since finding this delicious recipe
and have always gotten rave reviews.  Never any leftovers.
I  drain the corn, saving the liquid and then adding just a little bit if needed to the mix.  When the cheese is melted it tends to be  very juicy if you don't drain the corn.

Made it for 8 of my coworkers for lunch. They loved it. I scaled back a little on the jalapeno's, about 9 oz.'s worth. This is definitely a keeper.

I found this recipe several years ago and made it for a family reunion. After that, I have to take it EVERY time. It's a staple at our reunions and holidays. We usually make a smaller dish for the kids with no jalapenos. I cut the butter in 1/2. It tends to be a little greasy otherwise. Also, a whole jar of jalapenos is way too many. I usually do about 1/4 a cup of chopped peppers from the jar.

This is a delicious way to make corn. I halved the cream cheese and butter and used about 20 oz of frozen (cooked) corn.

I made this with frozen corn because it is firmer than canned.   I used 4 small cans of chopped green chilies.   2 bags jalape√±o jack and added onion powder.   topped with green onions, bacon, and the jalape√±o jack.  everyone LOVED!

Took this to Easter dinner and everyone loved it. I made it in a crockpot due to not having time to bake it after church. I used three bags of corn and one can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies. I only used one stick of butter and one sour cream plus the milk and there was more than enough sauce. I was told I could bring this to the next gathering. It makes a lot. I will probably cut it down some next time.

Cut the sauce in half and you will love it. I have also substituted a can of green chilies for the jalapeno and it turned out well for those who don't care for jalapenos.

This was surprisingly delicious.  I took a previous reviewer's advice and cut the butter to 1/2C.  I also added approx. 2 TBS of finally diced/pureed jalapeno to the cream cheese mixture, omitting the peppers in the corn. I sprinkled cooked, crumbled bacon on top of the cheese, sprinkled some bread crumbs on top of the bacon and topped it with approx. 1/2C of shredded cheese, omitting the shredded cheese in the sauce.  My crew absolutely loved it and is already asking for it again.

This dish is so yummy and every time I've made it for guests they all want the recipe.  Definitely gauge the amount of jalape√±os based on your taste buds, but, we love a little bit of heat so this is a perfect amount of peppers for my family. When I'm only cooking for two, I cut the recipe in half which still leaves plenty for leftovers the next day. Good stuff!!!

Love, love, love this recipe.  I'm a nut for hot stuff. Hot sauce is the condiment on the dinner table. Add it to everything.....Almost. I also make my own hot pepper powder from the peppers I grow in my garden which is an ingredient I use in a lot of my meals. I made changes to my taste but will not change the ingredients in recipe. I don't believe in measuring MOST of the time. Surprised that I own 3 measuring cups. Thanks Pixie for the recipe.

Love this recipe, but like others I halved the butter, milk and cream cheese.  I used 6 cans of corn.  I made it to serve 23 people on Thanksgiving so I used pimientos and canned Ortega chiles rather than Jalapenos (which I would have preferred).  What is so nice about it is that it tastes better the next day so I made it on Wednesday and baked on T/G.

Fantastic!  Made it for a tailgate yesterday (10/12) to go along with the BBQ theme.  Folks enjoyed it.  I took others' recommendations to only make half the sauce and then combine half the cheese in with the corn and jalapenos.  I think the idea of putting half the cheese in with the corn and jalapenos was right on, but next time I'll make it with the full amount of sauce just to see how it compares.  UPDATE:  Made this over the weekend (11/2) for a family get together and made the recipe using the full amount of sauce.  Both ways are delicious and I didn't find that there was too much sauce using the full amount.  I think it comes down to how many calories and fat you want to consume.  The butter did seem to be a bit much, so next time I'll try the full amount of cream cheese and milk and maybe 3/4 of the butter called for.  Both times I've made this, I've used the third less fat cream cheese.

This recipe has a great flavor-very cheesy! I love spicy foods, but I thought that it was too spicy. Because I used a jar of jalapenos (the peppers have more time to sit in the juice and soak up extra flavor) it was really spicy. I would either use no more than half a jar of diced jalapenos or use fresh ones and sautee them.

Very good but cut back on the butter. I use jalapenos and green chilis and serve this as a dip with chips.

Everyone loved this but I thought it was missing something but I couldn't put my finger on it. Maybe more spices? Overall a good dish. Thanks.

I got this recipe about 4 years ago and made it Thanksgiving to take to my in-laws dinner. I cannot begin to tell you how many people wanted seconds. I love jalapenos but not everyone does i only put about half the jar in for less heat. Even the older people were requesting i bring my "corn dish" every get together!!!!!! Thank you for the delicious alternative to plain corn!!!

Gave this recipe to my daughter who can't cook to take to a work lunch.  She called me so excited because someone had asked her for a recipe.  They have asked her to bring this recipe several times since then.  We use about 1/2 the jalapenos, but friends we have given the recipe to prefer the whole amount.

I brought it to work for a dinner and the people who were not afraid to try it loved it!! And bragged to the people who didn't!! Very easy and good, I didn't use as much butter as the recipe said.

A more accurate name would be RED HOT corn. I scaled the recipe to make 1/2 with no other changes in the recipe.I suggest cutting way back on the peppers. I like hot stuff, but this about took the skin off my tongue.

This went over very well with the family at Christmas dinner. The jalapenos I used were a little hot for my taste but still very tasty!
