Loved it! I've been looking for a recipe that rivaled the corn chowder they used to serve at a local resturaunt, and this is it. So eay to make, I also used canned potatos so could skip that step. I just threw everything together in one big pot and let it simmer for a while. The only thing I added was a little bit of garlic, and about a cup of sharp cheddar cheese right before I took it off the stove. My fiance loved it. I loved it. I will definately be making this one again, and often. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

Loved this recipe!!  I doubled, we are a family of 9.  I used canned potatoes so I skipped that chore.  I also sauted some celery with the onion in olive oil, skipped the water bit. Then added a bit of chicken flavored boullion powder after the milk.  All tolled it was ready in around 30 min tops, from start to finish!  

It is so easy to change and enhance.  I would try adding dill next time or mabey green chilies for a spicier version, no cayene use a splash of tabasco.  You are NOT going to mess up this one.  This is a great spur of the moment adder to a meal or pot luck.

Good basic recipe to start with. I added more potatoes, and also a few carrots. Threw in a handful of cheese at the end. Definitely needed more salt but pretty good basic soup for a cold night!

I add a large can of chicken, making a Chicken-Corn Chowder.  My daughter especially loves this chowder, but it gets a "thumbs up" with everyone.  I make it often during the winter - it's a great winter comfort food.

This corn chowder was EASY, CHEAP, NUTRITIOUS and DELICIOUS.  I am a busy mom on a budget so those are pretty much my main criteria for recipes and this one met them all (and then some!).  Since I didn't have cayenne pepper, I used tabasco.  I increased the celery to 3/4 cup for extra veggies, and tossed in a tablespoon of butter and a little garlic salt just for flavor.  I think I spent about $7 on the ingredients and spent about 10 minutes in the kitchen.  My husband (who hates having soup for dinner, especially vegetarian soup), liked it so much he's been eating the leftovers cold out of the fridge.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is unbelievable. I have been making Corn Chowder for as long as I can remember, and never did I make it with 7 ingredients plus cayenne if you like. Oddly enough though it tastes the exact same. Sometimes I sprinkle cooked bacon on the top right before I serve it and sometimes I put cooked chicken breast in it to make it a lttle heartier. Either way though, the soup is wonderful, with or without any additions.

A great soup. Easy as anything to make, you can modify the spices as you see fit, and the consistency is super. A meal in a bowl! I made this for my father, who loved it, and my boyfriend, who ate 2&1/2 bowls (somewhere around half the pot!) Great the next day, too.

I could have sworn I had a can of cream-style corn in my pantry, but it was no where to be found.  So I ended up using some of my frozen cream-style corn I had put up this summer.  It probably made the soup even better.  I also used fat-free half and half because it's what I had.  I added some white pepper.  I liked this soup and will definitely make it again.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and added 2 diced carrots (which I needed to use up) and some diced ham.  I sauted the carrots, onions and celery in a bit of olive oil to start with, added the ham and then the rest of the doubled ingrediants.  I skipped the water step and added a 3rd can of milk (2 regular and one fat free as I like a lot of broth.  I also added one packet of chicken boulion and letter it simmer about 50 minutes.  It was so easy to prepare and so absolutely yummy.  he cayenne gave it a great spice. Thank you for this recipe-it will be a regular.  My teen son loved it!

This is such a great recipe! I made it twice in one week if that gives you any idea! The only changes I made were that I doubled it, added three tablespoons of chicken boullion powder in place of the salt in the boiling water, and didnt drain afterward.  Instead of doubling evaporated milk to two cans, I put in a can and a half since I left in the water that the veggies cooked in.  It's so delicious that even my super picky kid loved it.  Everyone loved it!

Changed this up a little by sauteing celery, onion and a little red pepper for color in butter before adding broth and potatoes.  Did not drain broth before adding other ingredients so it was a little thin at first, but thickened up nicely with a little flour.  Loved the kick of the cayenne, but other than that just tasted like creamed corn with potatoes to me.  Very easy, but probably will not make again.

This recipe is pretty good!  I was looking for a corn chowder that wasn't high in fat...this def. works! I do replace the evaporated milk with the fat free version and it works fine.

Very Very Good!  This was my first time to make corn chowder.  I used this recipe as a guide and took some hints from other recipes and reviews.  I used 2 cans of potatoes and doubled the corns.  I also threw in a cup of chopped, cooked chicken.  I also sauted the onion and celery in butter then added it to my saucepot. It really heated up quickly.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I popped it in the crockpot with some extra potatoes, left it in for about 4 hours on high.  It was delicious.

I didn't want the extra carbs from the potatoes so I omitted them. But I did add some diced carrot. Super quick and easy to throw together but the flavor itself was just ok for us.  Glad I used 1 % evaportaed milk, it was plenty rich.  Used chipotle instead of cayenne. Topped with lime tortilla chips. This would be pretty small portions for 6 people.

Considering that it's a very simple and fast recipe, it was quite good. I made a few changes: 

-Instead of cayenne pepper, I added a few dashes of Tabasco and a bit of freshly ground black pepper and it worked very well. 
-I used 2% evaporated milk and while it may have resulted in less creaminess, it was fine and brought down the fat content a lot. 
-I left the skins on red potatoes to gain some nutritional value and it did not detract from the texture and enhanced the taste. 
-I used the whole can of cream corn (14.75 oz.) and also added a bit more potatoes. The soup seemed balanced and kept a good consistency.

Delicious and harty!  I loved this and it made for great left-overs (that I was, conveniently, able to bring to work for lunch).  I tweaked it slightly in that I used one can of creamed celery and instead of evaporated milk, I used a couple blops of sour cream.  It was creamy and delicious and I can't wait to make more.

Love this recipe!  I like reading other people's reviews and especially if they changed it up a bit.  I did on this one.  I sauteed yellow onions, red peppers, carrots, celery and garlic and then added then to the potatoes.  I love the little kick that the cayenne pepper adds.  Will for sure make again, especially because my two year is a fan. Whew!

I made this chowder and it turned out really good. I'm not fond of really thick corn chowder so I did not drained the water that the potatoes, onion and celery was cooked in. I also used fat free evaporated milk and it tasted fine. The only thing that was missing was a sprinkle of fresh parsley on top(will have some on hand next time lol).

This was a good recipe! I enjoyed it for what it is; a simple quick recipe. I think it's lacking some depth. Perhaps throwing some bacon in first and rendering before adding celery will help. Otherwise, very good recipe.

Such a good dinner for a cold night :)  I sauteed celery, garlic and onion in olive oil instead of boiling w/ potatoes.  Also added diced chicken and an extra can of creamed corn. It was very thick so I added a cup of chicken broth to it also.  Delicious!

It wasn't too bad but the flavour from the creamed corn took over the whole soup, I would rather be able to taste the individual flavours.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was bland. Tried to put in additional paprika and chicken broth but it was still so-so. Thanks anyway but won't be making this again.

Was a little on the bland side, so I increased the cayenne to about 1/4 tsp. Tasty! Thanks for posting

This could easily be a 5 star if it had more flavor.  Sugar, salt, cheese????

This was quite tasty--but it becomes 100 times better when you shred some cheddar cheese on top!

This was a great starting place. I was wanting something a little heartier, so I used the ingredients listed (except salt) and made some additions: used a whole celery stalk, added a diced carrot, filled my can from the evaporated milk with 2% milk and added that too, 1 low-sodium chicken bouillon cube, chopped up 2 pkgs of shaved turkey and threw that in as well. I cooked as directed, then added a good handful of shredded cheddar cheese and a big dollop of sour cream. YUMMY!

Pretty good, simple, quick stew. Although, I went brain dead and bought regular corn instead of creamed and I'm sure that would have bumped this up a little. 4 stars for getting my husband to eat more than one serving of this, which speaks volumes b/c he'd almost rather poke an eyeball out than hear we're having soup for dinner :)

I thought this chowder was really yummy!!! I tweaked it by substituting a can of Cream of Mushroom condensed soup for the evaporated milk and adding garlic powder, Sazon Completa from Badia, a cut up jalapeno (I simmered this with all the vegetables) and canned chicken. I also simmered the vegetables in chicken broth instead of water.  I also added about a quarter cup of water to thin it out a bit.

This was absolutely amazing.  I doubled up the corn and the milk, but left everything else the same.  Served this with some homemade yeast rolls and a side Cesar salad.  It was a hit.  I've already shared this recipe with one of my friends.  Will be one of the new staples for fall/winter cooking.  Thanks for sharing with us!!!

Has a great kick to it! Just know that it's a little spicy, so add less ceyenne pepper if you like less spice.

This is one of my favorite recipes.. because of the ratio OF goodness to ease!! I leave out the celery just because my husband doesn't like it.  This is his FAVORITE soup and craves it when he comes back from snow plowing! Thanks for this great recipe I can make so easily and quickly with stuff I already have in the house!  I do normally use a little more potatoes than the recipe calls for which makes it a little bit thicker. I also sprinkle w/cheddar cheese.. SO AWESOME.. THIS IS THE BEST!!

This is a very good gluten free recipe. Second time though I rounded all the fresh cut ingredients, plus added an extra can of corn and some chopped green onions too. Hearty and Delicious!

This is a good basic recipe, but I wonder about pouring out the stock from the cooked vegetables.  I use minimum water and then just add the other ingredients.  I don’t want to dump the vitamins and minerals down the drain.  I use frozen corn instead of canned whole corn, add a diced carrot and a bit of diced bell pepper as well as a few drops of hot sauce.

Surprisingly good!
I used red potatoes, 2 unchopped celery stalks with the leaves still on in the boiling step.  Threw out the celery after boiling. Added some sauteed turkey brats at the end.  It was good before I added those, I would have enjoyed it without he brats, just wanted to use up the brats.

This was seriously good chowder, I couldn't stop eating it.  It tastes just like the corn chowder they serve at Panera Bread, which is my favorite.  I did add some cooked chicken to it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Even with the addition of the cayenne pepper this chowder is pretty bland. I added some dill and a handful of crumbled bacon but it was still lacking flavor. It might be better to saute the onions and celery in a little butter rather than boiling them with the potatoes.

This was very easy to make, but not something I will want to make again.  It definitely was edible, but there are many better corn chowder recipes out there.  This was lacking something.  Like other suggested, I doubled the corn, added an extra cup of potatoes, and added extra salt and pepper.  This was just so-so.

Great taste, simple.  Don't be afraid to drain ALL water from potatoes, canned goods add enough liquid, won't be too thick.

Not Bad! Sauteed onion and celery in olive oil, used frozen corn for both regular and creamed corn portions, added 2 cups diced cooked chicken, 2 chicken boullion cubes and along with the evaporated milk, added 1 cup buttermilk.  Sprinkled with McCormick's Salad Supreme, shredded mozzarella cheese and topped with sour cream. Very tasty! Served with sourdough bread! It's a rib-sticker and nice for an Autumn evening meal! Thanks for the post.

This is a great basic recipe.  After making it as written, I made the following changes for our taste to raise it to a 5 star: I subbed Tabasco sauce for the cayenne, melted in about a cup of shredded cheddar at the end of cooking, and added beef smoked sausage about 10 minutes before the end of cooking. I also mixed in a little black pepper.

Excellent basic corn chowder. Very similar recipe I learned from my sister-in-law while living in Maine. Only changes I made was to saute onion and celery in 2 Tbsp butter before adding potatoes and covering all with water. After potatoes got fork tender, I used my pastry blender to mash up some of the potatoes. I used 12 oz half-and-half instead of evaporated milk. I added approx 3 Tbsp instant mashed potatoes to slightly thicken. Lastly, I added 4 Tbsp butter to melt on the top. Definitely need to add salt to taste.  Easy and delicious!

I used fresh corn on the cob left over from prior day.  I used about 4 ears.  Didn't have evaporated milk-used whole milk.  Cooked the potatoes-3 yukon gold, 1 carrot, 1 celery stick as directed.  Saved water from boiling and put cold corn and cold milk in 2 batches in bullet to puree.  Pureed hot veggies with cold corn puree.  Added all back to pot with left over water-small amount left.  Added salt,  4 tbls. butter, 1/2 tsp cayenne.  Added 1 tbsp. chicken bullion and a shake of instant potatoes.  Should have used an extra potato or bigger ones but instant thickened it up nicely.  Great recipe and easy to customize to your own taste.

Without modifications, the chowder was rather bland and not noteworthy. However, after I made a couple modifications the chowder was superb. I even have some frozen for future meals. First, I upped the amount of celery and onions to a full cup. I also sauteed them until the onions were clear before adding the potatoes and water to simmer. I reserved 1 cup of the simmering broth to thin out the chowder in the final step. Instead of evaporated milk I used cream of celery. So, in the end I wouldn't make this particular recipe again but I would definitely make it again with said modifications.

Here is what I substituted: yellow onions for red onions, thinly sliced carrots for celery. 
Here is what I advise: simmer the potatoes, onions, and carrots for longer than 20 minutes- test with fork to make sure potatoes are tender ; I had to add an extra can of evaporated milk and a dash of corn starch.

Do not overcook the potatoes like I did.  I used a can of sweet corn and it made this chowder a bit too sweet for my liking.  The evaporated milk make this a little rich.  Overall, it wasn't bad.  I think if I added a ham hock or smoked ham, it will offset the sweetness and be so much better.  Will try it next time.

Yummy.  Was looking for a recipe to accommodate a diabetic diet.  I omitted the potatoes and used quinoa since it cooked in the same time anyways to add more fiber and protein.  I didn't use celery, but I did sauté the veggies (shredded carrot, onion, red pepper) with some olive oil before adding water and quinoa.  I omitted the salt and added my own seasonings to flavor and it is delicious!  Definitely able to doctor it up to your needs!

Awesome. T'was my first time making any type of chowder and it was nice! The recipe is simple and the taste was great! I added carrots and extra potato. I think this recipe is a great base that you can add things to or not and it's just as good.

I added a little extra salt and more cayenne pepper. Instead of a red onion, I used a sweet onion. The result was a delicious and hearty soup with a slightly sweet-spicy taste. 

Make sure you remember to stir frequently once the evaporated milk is added. Otherwise, it can burn quickly on the bottom.

This was DELICIOUS!  I added more potatoes and a bit of garlic and also substituted hot sauce for the cayenne.  I made it as 8 servings and it's totally gone with only 3 of us eating!!!! This is another new family fave!

We quite enjoyed this chowder. We made a few adjustments/additions to the recipe (3/4 c. diced celery instead of 1/2, 1/4 tsp. grnd cayenne pepper instead of 1/8 and we added 1 minced clove of garlic and 1/2 c. sharp 'white' cheddar cheese) as recommended by other reviewers which is why we rated it '4' stars instead of '5'. We also made sure to dice small cubes where the potatoes where concerned as suggested by other reviewers as well. Thanks for this recipe CARIBOUR. Cheerio :o)

SUPER easy! No smoky bacon flavor but delicious all the same. The only thing I did different was after I boiled the veggies, I sauteed them in a little  butter to be sure the potatoes had flavor. My hubby LOVED it. I loved that it was easy prep and quick to make.

This soup is amazing! I took reviewer advice and added the sharp cheddar cheese. It makes it so creamy and adds an extra little kick of taste. I also added extra celery -  I have to get veggies into my husband any way I can. We love this soup!

This Chowder is a crowd pleaser! I have made it for our Church Fall Festival for the last two years and it always dissapears. I do add just a little bit more pepper then the recipe calls for. But it really doesn't need too many adjustments and it is extremely easy even when making a batch for 100 people!

This was wonderful!  I made a double batch for a luncheon and everyone loved it!  I did add diced cooked chicken breast at the end and let it simmer to incorporate it.  I also used skim evaporated milk, and thinned the whole thing with chicken broth as it is very thick.  Loved it, will certainly make again!

My favorite Corn Chowder isn't available at my store anymore(snows) so I decided to make it. This was pretty good, I had to use condensed milk cause it's all I had. It made it more sweet, but still good. Next time I think I'll use less potatoes (I didn't measure them!!)
But it was yummy!!

This chowder was alright, but I wasn't thrilled. I felt it was lacking something, but I didn't know what to add to it to make it better as I'm not an experienced cook who intuitively knows how to change a recipe. I would try other recipes before making this one again.

This was a good basic recipe, good for the creative cook.  It gave me an easy jumping off point to make a corn chowder the way I would like it.  I substituted the celery for a red bell pepper, the cayenne for tabsco sauce and added bacon, canned crab and a bag of shredded "mexican style" cheese to thicken it.  It was so good!

I was looking for a corn chowder recipe that used less cream and cheese than a typical recipe, and this one was perfect.  Its very tasty, and if you get reduced fat/skim evaporated milk, its even a little healthier!
