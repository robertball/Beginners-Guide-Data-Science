Excellent recipe!  I doubled the recipe, with the exception of the cream at the end -- I used 1 cup of fat-free half & half.  I also used chicken stock in place of the water, and added one clove of pressed garlic, and 10oz of bella mushrooms.  At the end of cooking, I removed a healthy ladle-full of the soup and pureed it.  I think that really enhanced the mushroom flavour and aroma.  Thanks for the best mushroom soup recipe I have ever ever eaten!!

This is absolutely the best. I did make a couple changes and used veg broth instead of water and added a minced tsp of garlic and I think it turned out even better. I highly recommend using the veg broth instead of water. I have made this several times now and recommend to anyone that loves mushrooms to try this. You wont be disappointed!

This was absolutely wonderful!!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I threw in some fresh broccoli, chives, and 4 cloves of garlic about 10 mins. before the cream and cheese. My husband loved it. I will most certainly make it again.

This was delicious!! Instead of cream, i added a can of mushroom soup instead, and i left out the parmesan. I love how creamy it came out with the mushroom soup. I can't wait to make this again!!

Absolutely superb--made me daydream of having my own restaurant =) Atypical for me, I "obeyed" the recipe exactly, EXCEPT for using shallot in place of onion (thought it would give the rich onion/garlic taste, which it in fact it did). I doubted many of the ingredients (too much pepper? celery and carrots with mushrooms? should I replace stock for water? will my fresh parmesan overpower the flavors?) but made it exactly and was very pleased. I will probably add an extra Tbsp. of flour next time. OH- this would be an outstanding SLOW COOKER recipe--I made something extemely similar once before; probably do the sauteeing and roux, then toss it all in except the cheese and milk.

Great Recipe! Very easy to make, and tasted wonderfull. We followed the instructions almost exactly. One pound of mushrooms looks like a lot when its sliced and uncooked, but its just right when ready to eat

Simply wonderful.  I left out the carrots and celery and added more potatoes out of sheer preference and the chowder turned out lovely.  This recipe makes a wonderful sidedish as well as a main course.  Highly recommended!  I'll be making this on a regular basis.

I made this on a very cold night, and it was delicious! I served it with garlic bread, and it was just perfect. My  store had a sale on portabello mushrooms, so I used those. It was great. Thanks so much for sharing.

Yummy! I could not stop eating this. I did make a couple of changes.  I used half&half instead of cream because thats all I had.  I omitted the water but added only 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth. I added some brocolli and fresh garlic. Can't wait to make it again. Thanks!

Outstanding!  I didn't have carrots on hand, so I increased the amount of spuds and mushrooms and all worked well.  I also used up the rest of my sour lean (light sour cream) in place of the light cream and it added a nice rich flavor.  Added more salt and will use garlic next time.  Delicious, thanks!

I really like this soup.  It was very flavorful and was easy to make.  I added about 1tablespoon garlic with the onions and instead of 3cups of water I used 2cups vegetable broth and 1 cup water.

I thought this was ok, I just did not like the greasy look the soup has.  Followed the recipe exactly, rather a little bland.  Needed to add plenty of seasoning.  Maybe this is what a Chowder tastes like, not sure but I don't think I will be making this again.

This was a tasty soup after some slight adjustments. I felt it needed more flavor so I added a teaspoon of paprika and a handfull of diced fresh parsly. Super easy and great for a cool night. Husband loved it, though he added some Frank's hot sauce (which he adds to everthing). My two year old loved it, too.

Very delicious. Made it exactly per recipe. I did feel it was more of a cream of vegetable soup with an overall mushroom flavor. I will make it again and probably add more potato and tabasco sauce.

I thought this was very bland. I followed the recipe to the tee. There was not enough flavor or herbs. I may try it again if I can't find anything else.

This is a husband-pleaser. It's the "best soup I've ever made"! I was even asked by our friends to make an enormous pot next time. I did the same as E J by pureeing some of the veggies and adding it to the soup. The only other thing I changed was that I used tapioca flour instead of wheat flour to make it gluten-free. Delicious!

I used veg broth instead of water and made the rue separately.  I sauteed onion, carrot, and garlic in EVOO until soft.  Next added the broth.  once that had simmered for 10 min I added the rue slowly.  Then it was getting a little thick so i added more water brought it back up to a boil then added the potatoes.  I tasted it and it was missing something, I had some red wine so i added about 1/4 cup (keep in mind i probably doubled this recipe).  The red wine added the perfect amount of depth to this soup.  Turned out super tasty, just think the receipt is missing a couple things (mainly garlic and red wine).  I also left out the celery, but if i would have added it would have done it in the first sautee step - to make a mirepoix.

This soup was great!  I tweaked the recipe a bit as others did.  I pureed about 2-3 cups of the soup and added it back in before adding the cheese and cream.  This definitely thickens it up nicely and adds flavor.  I added chopped garlic with the onions.  I agree with other reviewers that more flour could be helpful.  The last addition I made was chopped parsley.  When making this, it appears that there are almost too many veggies for the amount of liquid, but they really do reduce in size.  Also, if you plan to puree part of the soup and still want a hearty mixture, I recommend as much as double the veggies!  Great soup, though I may add some chicken next time.

So yummy!! I made a few changes to get the consistency and taste i wanted. Used 1 cup of heavy cream, sauteed garlic with the onions and butter and added more potatoes. I also pureed about 2 cups of the chowder and added it back before adding the cream. Turned out amazing!

Delicious! I used a precious poster's idea to puree 2 cups or so of the soup and add it back in, (as we like a thicker soup) and it really did increase the mushroom flavor throughout the soup!  Will make again!

This is a delicious soup!  I did make some changes, only because of the past reviews and what I had on hand.  I added about 2 heaping Tablespoons of garlic to the onion and sauteed them along with the celery and carrot.  I added about 3 times as much flour to the roux as I wanted a thicker, chowder like consistency.  I used both white button mushrooms and baby bellas and doubled the potato.  In lieu of the heavy cream I used half-n-half and used veggie stock instead of the water.  I brought this to work for a Soup-Off and it was a HIT!  Mine was gone within minutes of arriving and the vegetarians were thrilled to have a tasty option.  This was a very tasty soup, and I am going to use the base of it for a variety of creamy soups - so TASTY!

Great soup!  I read the reviews and made the changes recommended: vegetable broth instead of water, 1 tsp crushed garlic, 1 tbsp parsley flakes, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and added 1/2 cup instant potatoes at the end to thicken the broth and boost the potato flavor.  One cup of potatoes is not enough and I will use at least 2 large potatoes next time.  Also, after adding all the vegetables, it looks like there isn't enough broth but don't be tempted to add more liquid!  After the cooking time, it's just right.  I added the instant potatoes just to thicken it up a bit. A very good soup; thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very good soup. I followed the recipe to a
tee except for cutting the mushrooms back to 1/2
pound and using vegetable stock instead of water.
I also added 2 tea. of dried chives, 1 tea. of minced
garlic and 1/4 cup instant potato flakes at the end
to thicken it a little more. This makes a wonderful,
rich, thick soup that is even tastier the next day.
A 5 star recipe that is highly recommended!

I used chicken broth in place of the water and I thought there was too many mushrooms and not enough potatoes, next time I will adjust that (that's MY preference).   Guess that would make it "Potato and Mushroom Chowder" then eh?  LOL  Works for me!  I also used skim milk instead of the cream. 
Good recipe.

Very tasty. 1 hour from from chopping until sitting at the table to enjoy. I added one can of chicken broth and used
2 cups of chopped russet potatoes. We had a great meal with egg rolls from this site.

Very delicous!  Will make it again.  I followed the recipe, exactly except I added more water, because i thought mushrooms were alot, but it wasn't after you cook it down.  Mushrooms will shrink down alittle.  Just follow the recipe.  It will turn out perfect.  I love it!

Wow... suprisingly flavorful!  My husband and I love this soup!  I have made it once with the amount of butter and cream called for and once with half the amount, and I didn't notice much of a difference at all, so I would probably do that again, just to make it a bit lower fat.  I will make this again and again!

Very good. I used one 12 oz can evaporated milk instead of cream, 5 red skinned potatoes with skins on, and corn instead of carrots (1 can creamed corn plus 1-2 cups frozen corn). I also used vegetable broth instead of water, and I added about a teaspoon of dried thyme.

Very good recipe. Used chicken stock instead of water. If you do this, don't need the salt. Also, doubled the quantity of the cream and cheese for extra taste and kick. Good spring recipe to make with everything in season now. Thanks!

I thought this was a really good soup. I made a few adjustments..I added a bunch of garlic with the onions, used half chicken stock and half water. Also i left out the celery and added broccoli. It could have used more flour to make a thicker soup. Overall it was delicious and will make again :)

This was the first official chowder that I've ever made and it was scrumptious! I did make a few changes though. I added 4 cups water instead of 3, added more pepper (to taste), added 1/2 cup finely chopped broccoli (florets and the greenest parts of the stems), 1 tbs minced garlic, 2 sprigs of fresh thyme, 1 tsp fresh minced sage, and since I didn't have light cream I used 1 cup of milk with 2 tbs whipped cream cheese. The chowder was a great dinner and even better for subsequent lunches. I tasted much better after having sit for a day or so in the fridge so, in the future, I might make it in advance.

This soup was easy to make and delicious! I doubled the vegetables though since I wanted a thicker soup. I used olive oil instead of butter, and whole milk instead of cream. I also added basil, chives, and broccoli. I used yellow potatoes and didnt even peel them. I did increase the parmesian cheese to 1/2 cup. I took others advice and blended a few cups to make it smother. I was very pleased with the flavor and texture. I think next time I will add more broccoli because the tiny bits made a very nice mixture. Great recipe!

This soup is really really good! I made the recipe exactly as it is but I think next time I will add a little garlic and parsley and use veg stock instead of water. I will also double the potatoes and carrots to make it heartier. Like most soups I make, I pureed about 1/3 of this and added it back into the pot before adding the cream and cheese. It really brought out the flavor and gave it a nice consistancy. Can't wait to make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my new favourite soup recipe.   I doubled the potatoes to make it thicker and added garlic and parsley.  I diced vegetables and mushrooms quite small and sauteed the mushrooms with the onions.  I ran the hand blender through it to make it smoother just before adding the cream and cheese.  I suggest serving with fresh from the oven biscuits.  Yum!!

Healthy and flavorful soup.  I put a couple boullion cubes in with the water and put half the soup in a blender, which I think really helped it be soup-like rather than chunky.  Used half thick cream and half whole milk, but my husband agreed that it could have been thicker so next time I will use all thick cream.

This is a great soup with a great flavor.  I've made it as the recipe says and it comes out well, but to make it a bit more like a chowder, I now double the flour to 1/4 C, decrease the water to 2 C (a lot of water comes out of the veggies as they cook down) and use heavy cream instead of the light.

We thought this recipe was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted corn for the celery and carrots.  I also doubled the potatoes and in the end felt like I could have used even more.  My 8 year old said it was the best soup she ever had!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe.  Perfect warmup for winter, although I enjoy it any time!  I didn't change a thing and I thought it was great.

This recipe is fantastic!  It's really good for those who hang out with vegetarians (but not vegans).

We made several “preference” changes to this recipe after reading over the reviews. We used 2T butter & 2T EVOO, 1 medium onion, 1 garlic clove, minced, 2 celery stocks, diced, 3 cups potatoes, pealed & diced, a small handful of baby carrots, diced, 3 ½c stock (instead of water) & 1c fat free milk (instead of cream).  We omitted the salt but followed the remaining recipe as written.  We used an emulsion blender before adding the milk and parmesan cheese.  This was quite filling & very, very delicious!  
Important note:  The “broth” mixture WILL NOT cover the vegetables as it simmers.  Don’t add more liquid or be tempted to open the pot to stir.

I made this for a friend because I am not a muchroom fan, but it was actually quite good.  Definately needs garic and I added sharp cheddar instead of the parm.  Very hearty and creamy, a nice tasting base.

This is an amazing soup. Delicious! I left out that carrots and added jsut a bit more parmesan. The flavour is out of this world and it is so quick and easy to make. I will definitley be making this again.

Everyone loved this soup at our  Soup & Bread night at my Church . I made  the following changes to the original recipe  1. I used chicken stock instead of water  2.  I added  chopped browned bacon (Everything is better with bacon, right?) 3. I used a mixture of sliced regular white mushroom and baby bella mushrooms. 4. I replaced the light cream with fat free half & half.

Tasty and filling! Definitely follow the other reviewers' suggestion to switch out the plain water for vegetable broth. If you're using bullion cubes, 1 cube for the three cups of water worked fine for me. I also added in a crushed garlic clove. To finish/thicken, I took out 3 cups of the soup and blitzed them with the stick blender, then added that back in with the cheese and a healthy dash of balsamic vinegar (about a tablespoon) for a richer flavor. I didn't add the cream, blending 3 cups of the mixture worked just fine to thicken it instead. It's gonna look like a ridiculous amount of mushrooms when you first add the fresh ones in - don't worry, they reduce down just fine.

This was good. I couldn't find light cream so I used heavy whipping cream and it turned out great. I added a little garlic and used half chicken broth and half water. Will make again.

While the taste of the broth is awesome, I followed this recipe exactly and the potatoes and carrots were not cooked.  Nothing like eating almost raw veggies (okay, raw) inside of a delicious broth!  So, two stars from me; this recipe needs some kind of editing.

So very delicious!  This reminded me so much of the classic beef stew that I miss since becoming vegetarian, except creamier and more delicious.  The only change I made was using mushroom broth (from boullion cubes) instead of plain water, and it really enriched the mushroom taste.  The veggies get soft and perfect.  Next time I might add peas as well.

Awesome recipe! Followed the recipe as it was except added a little more flour. The end result was amazing! I'm not a person who usually cooks and even for me this was a delicious yet easy recipe. I will so do this recipe again and again.

This was average at best.  I substituted half and half for the cream and maybe that was my mistake.  Soup was a little to watery for my taste.

Amazing...I took other's advise and used the potatoe water. I cut the liquid to 2 cups(1Cup Potatoe Water & 1 Cup Water with 1 1/2 Tsp Veggie Better than Bouillon added) I whipped the potatoe with Dill and Cream. I added 1/2 Bulb chopped garlic along with 5 sprigs of fresh Rosemary. Chopped this with Onion and Celery. I took the other 1/2 Bulb of Garlic and Roasted it. Did not need Salt.Used Portobello Mushrooms. Added some left over Mushroom Gravy I had. Did not add flour..the mashed potatoe thickened it nicely. Added more Dill to soup to season. Added 1/2 & 1/2 as that is all I had along with 2 tbsp sour cream (optional) Lots of flavour & textures. Great winter warmer...

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I did have to use half and half cream instead of light and I omitted the salt (I rarely use salt when cooking/baking). My husband added some Oregano and salt, next time he's going to try Rosemary (and he'll keep trying other spices until he gets it the way he likes). I think next time I'll cut back on the amount of water as well. It did thicken up after it sat for awhile though. Overall this was super yummy, and I also think some shredded smoked Gouda next time too.

This is a good chowder.  I didn't love it, I could take or leave mushrooms though.  But the mushroom lovers did love it! I made it to go with the italian bread bowl recipe from this site.  And although I wouldn't recommend it with the bread bowls, it is really good all by itself.

Excellent comfort soup for a chilly, rainy, Sunday.  I did saute all of the veggies except the potatoes (about a double amt of all) before adding the flour and used 1 can of beef broth, just adding water to cover.

This is very good!  We always sautee our mushrooms in olive oil and garlic before we put them in the soup, but this is an excellent recipe.

My whole family has allergies to mushrooms of every kind and this recipe looked so good to me. I just left out the mushrooms and added more potatos. It turned out fantastic! Definatly a keeper.

I hardly ever have soup because I don't really like soup.  I came across this recipe about three months ago and I've made it at least five times since then. Delicious!!  I've followed some suggestions like using vegetable broth and adding more potatoes.  Served with salad and crusty bread, or maybe hummus and crackers - a meal.  What a great find!

Best mushroom soup ever!! I followed this recipe really closely and was soo pleased with how it turned out! Even my mushroom loathing hubby went back for seconds:) I think I will follow another reviewers recommendation next time and puree a little bit of soup and add it back at the end to increase the mushroom flavor!

This recipe is fantastic!  I made it for my soup-loving in-laws when they were visiting and it was a huge hit.  They even took the recipe with them on vacation with friends and impressed the gourmet group with this fancy dish!! It is a great, cool weather, filling and satisfying meal with a green salad and a warm crusty bread.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the  best soup I have ever eaten! hahah I can't stop eating it, it's DELICIOUS!! I actually used half and half for the cream like someone else had mentioned. Also, next time I make it I will definitely use more veges... I wondered if just 1 cup of potato and a 1/2 cup of carrots would be enough, and it's really not. Other than that though, the taste is amazing... Yummyyyyyy!!

This was very good!  I like the potato / mushroom combination.  But, for us, it was a little bland- we're spicy people.  But, as far as potato soups go- this was tasty- just not a 'wow'.  Very easy- good leftovers too- and delightful to sink a hunk of bread into.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great recipe. I made a little extra and when I was cooking it, I had unexpected company..offered them a bowl and there no leftovers. Made with crusty bread. Really no changes to the recipe needed! I used freshed baby bella mushrooms.

Very nice --- recommended. Especially pleasant with fresh buttered rolls; good on a cold day...  All was easily gone when enjoyed by the 4 of us -- next time will consider doubling to (hopefully) ensure some leftovers.

This was very good and simple.  I didn't have parm cheese, celery, or cream.  I used some celery salt and 2% milk to compensate and increased the flour a bit.  I doubled the potato, too, out of sheer greed.  It was creamy (though I will try to use cream next time) and wonderful.  I ate it for three nights running with crackers and hummus.  Will definately make again and again.

This was so easy to make (even for a beginner) and it was delicious!  After reading other reviews, I also used a vegetable broth instead of water and a tiny bit of garlic.  So good!
