Chef John has done it again. These are fantastic. I had to go to the Chinese items in grocery store to find the five spice powder. It made the tarts special.

After watching the video about how to make this, it was so simple to make.  So easy and delicious!  A little time consuming, but so worth it....they don't reheat well, so eat them right away.

We think it was a 4-star recipe because the instructions were confusing, but it tasted wonderful. the Chinese five-spice was a great touch with the peaches. All in all, it was worth it

Two points: I used pears which worked fine and I had trouble finding the ready to use pie dough but found it at a local Giant. This is a rather easy recipe that produces a visually appealing and tasty dessert. It makes a reasonable left over in a microwave. I will be making it again soon!

This recipe was quite simple to prepare.  I used my own pastry dough, which I prefer.  I will make these again, but I'm not sold on the Chinese 5 Spice.  The flavour was a little odd, so I'll use cinnamon and maybe a bit of nutmeg next time.  Really pinch the sides together or the circles will flatten.

It tastes great for as easy as it is to make.  Make sure you fold over the lip as shown in the video or picture to hold back the juices.  I flipped the edge up and pinched it together to for a rim similar to a tart pan.  It went flat halfway through baking totally making a mess...batch number two was better looking.
