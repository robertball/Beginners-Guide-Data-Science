Delicious recipe! My husband and I decided to make this with our leftover homemade chili. The taste was great, the flavor was enhanced with the hotdogs. My only suggestion is that the consistency wasn't as I had hoped. It kind of fell apart even after letting it rest for a bit. Perhaps next time I would put more potatoes on the bottom or add an extra layer to help keep it together.
