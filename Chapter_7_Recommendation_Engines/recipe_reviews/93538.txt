The first time I made this soup, I decided to add some meat (1.5 lbs of boneless sirloin steak, cut up). I cooked the meat in the soup pot and seasoned it with pepper, minced garlic, and Worcestershire sauce. I didn't drain the meat just followed the directions from the beginning. ****The second time I made this I left out the meat altogether. For the veggies, I used 6 instead of 4 potatoes, 16 oz frozen broccoli cuts, and two bags of the blend called for in the recipe. Added half of the frozen veggies with the potatoes and the other half with the canned soups and cheese. This allowed some of the vegetables to melt into the background, but you still have some cooked only slightly which gave some bulk to the soup. I must admit I loved this soup both ways I made it. I'll be making this again for sure:)!!!

It really is easy, and wonderful.  More of a potato soup than vegetable, and it's really thick which I like because it's very filling.  I left out the onion and used an etra potato.  Loved it!

This was simple "dump" soup that we all enjoyed. I substituted cream of broccoli for the cream of celery (because I had it)and I also added carrots, green beans and corn as well as the cauliflower mix. I ended up adding noodles and chicken to it too. My family ate every bite. I cooked this in the crockpot as everything that I had was frozen (including a baggie of pulled chicken). I did add the noodles about an hour before eating and the cheese just before serving.

Very good soup!  Great for a cold night.  I added a few more cubes of cheese than it called for and served with crackers.  Will make again!

I thought it was great, but the kids wouldn't really eat much so not sure that I will make it again.
