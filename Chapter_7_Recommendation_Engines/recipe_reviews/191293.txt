I had high hopes for this one, especially since I was making it for Mother's Day.  I followed the recipe exactly and used 4 boneless chicken breasts that marinated overnight.  They had a beautiful orange color and the marinade smelled great.  The chicken was tender and moist, but had absolutely no flavor at all whatsoever! Bland, bland, bland.....

This is pretty good. I added fesh rosemary and fresh thyme.  Used bone in breasts instead of thighs.  Next time I might add a little hot sauce or more herbs.

Marinade was very good.  I used this to make the chicken tender before we BBQed it.  It worked!  Too bad my husband smothered it in traditional BBQ sauce once it was on the grill and burnt it all BLACK!  Meat was still moist though, I'm assuming from this marinade.

I didn't carefully measure the lemon and orange zest, so maybe I just used too much.  Or, maybe I let it marinate a bit too long - almost 48 hours because we unexpectedly couldn't cook it when we planned to.  Whatever it was, my fiance said the chicken had a nice flavor but the outide and the marinade had too strong of a citrus flavor.
