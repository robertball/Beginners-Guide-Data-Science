Really yummy curry and a great alternative to Indian curries, which I also love to make.  I love jackfruit, so I was sold by the title.  I used half garam masala and half regular yellow curry powder.  I garnished with fresh bamboo shoot, cilantro, and a red rice I made with achiote molido and Szechuan pepperberries I had available in the kitchen.

This was so good. I found out I'm allergic to jack fruit, but I think pineapple will be a good substitute. My family really liked this recipe too.

Real Burmese curried return-oil chicken!  Yes to the marinade. Heavenly chicken.
