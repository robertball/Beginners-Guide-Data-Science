To all those who have criticized this recipe, here are a few notes:

1.  Use fresh parmesan, grated (many reviewers say they HAVE, but...)

2.  Add it SLOWLY -- don't dump the whole amount of cheese in at one time.  Add it a half cup at a time, and keep stirring, and wait 3 or so minutes, and....

3.  Put the heat on medium, not medium low, and....

4.  Stir constantly, and...

5.  Recognize it can be a BASE.  For those of you who like more flavor, add garlic or onions or oregano or hot sauce or whatever you want.

It's fine as it is, when made properly.  If you want more flavors, or want it thicker, or want it thinner, correct as you go.

I love this sauce! I melt the butter, then add the cream and get that all mixed in and then wisk constantly while I add the cheese one handful at the time. Once everything is mixed in I just go through my spice rack and add whatever I want. Usually I use garlic powder, italian seasonings, basil, and parsly. I could eat this all by itself! Better than Olive Garden!

My husband requested I make Chicken Fettuccine for his birthday.  I used this sauce and he said it was better than the restaurant sauce.  The trick is to heat the cream slowly until it is almost simmering, then whisk the butter into the cream in small pieces until melted.  Then whisk the cheese in until melted and use freshly grated cheese if available.  The sauce comes out creamy, thick and delightful.  A great recipe....

I am extremely picky with Alfredo sauces. I don't buy anything off the shelves, and I've tried the mixes, but nothing compares to this recipe. It's as good as The Olive Garden's (if not better) Alfredo sauce. Until this recipe came along, I didn't eat any Fettuccini Alfredo if it wasn't The Olive Garden's. I'll be saving money.

Wonderful!!! I always add a clove of crushed garlic and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the butter. Be sure to add your parm. slowly, no more than half a cup at a time, as others have suggested. This will make all the difference! Toss with 12oz of fettuccine pasta and add a couple of grilled chicken breasts!

WOW! What can I say! This sauce is out of this world! And SO easy!! My kids and husband LOVED it too!!! I liked the texture of parm. cheese! Some of the best italian restaurants around here have the same texture in their alfredo sauce...the only change I made was I added about a 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder...really put it over the top! Thanks SO much!!!

I first made this over a year ago and I still make quite regularly. It is so easy to make. I get the best results by adding the butter and letting it melt, then add the cream let it heat up. Last add the cheese. I also add frozen spinach or chicken. I love the taste of this recipe.

This was very very good.  I did add 2 cloves garlic, and a tiny amount of fresh ground pepper and basil.  Next time I will add 3 cloves garlic and salt and much more pepper and basil.  I think adding nutmeg would make it more authentic tasting, but I personally do not like the taste of nutmeg.  The consistency was very creamy and good - and I only had about 7 oz of heavy cream on hand so used 1/2 & 1/2 to bring it up to one pint.  Tossed in diced leftover chicken and spinach for a one dish meal that everyone loved.  Thank you for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!

This sauce was very bland.  I also had trouble getting a smooth consistancy, even with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  I've made creamy cheese sauces before with no problem.  I'm not sure what happened here.  I won't make this sauce again.

Delicious!! This sauce is just like Olive Garden's and very easy to make. The key to getting a smooth sauce is to melt the butter first, add the cream (milk works, too), and then heat on high, stirring constantly. You don't have to add cheese bit by bit- dumping it all in is fine, but you have to use fresh shredded parmesan, not grated in the jar with the green lid. SHREDDED. Stir constantly with a WHISK while on high, the cheese will melt and be thick, then it will thin out into a nice smooth sauce. When it reaches that state, take it off the heat. This is also good with a little garlic powder and pepper added for an extra kick of flavor.

Simple, easy, delicious.  Few points :  grate your own Parmesan cheese.  Often when you buy pre-grated Parmesan, there is cellulose added to prevent clumping.  That cellulose inhibits proper melting ... your sauce will not turn out correctly.  For those that say their sauce was grainy, this is most likely the culprit.   Second, if you can buy it or do it yourself, clarify your butter.  It helps incorporate the butter into the sauce much better.   It is time consuming, but it makes a difference.  Last, use unsalted butter, always.  Salted butter should only be served on bread at the table.  For cooking, you should always use unsalted butter.

This couldn't be easier and couldn't be improved upon in my view.  Even Hubs, who generally has a minor hissy fit when I add Parmesan to dishes, gave it a nod of approval.  A little freshly grated nutmeg would be good, but wouldn't necessarily make this a better dish.  Be sure to save some of the pasta cooking water in case you need to add it to the finished dish as it stands.

I can't believe some people can't make this sauce! There's only 3 ingredients! 4 if you count the noodles. Good grief, If it's too thick, add some cream. If it's too bland, add some spice. It's just a base. If you can't make something like this, you have no business cooking. I pity your family. I added garlic, a little bacon, removed from heat, then a little fresh tomato. Excellent.

I have been making my alfredo sauce the same way for years with some minor differences.  I always use unsalted butter, which I place in the saucepan first.  Once melted I place one slice of onion chopped finely.  Note: I use a thin slice to ensure it simply adds flavor and does not overpower the sauce.  I let the onions cook for a bit and then add one crushed garlic and two leaves of fresh basil (If I only have dried crushed basil on hand I omit it from the recipe).  Once the onions turn translucent, remove the crushed garlic from the pan and add the cream.  Stir until the sauce comes to a slow boil.  Turn down flame, slowly add FRESHLY GRATED Parmesan cheese (fresh is key, do not substitute), 1/2 a cup at a time making sure to constantly stir.  Do not add more cheese until the previous batch is fully melted into the sauce.  Add two pinches of sea salt and a dash of pepper.  Stir until combined.  Remove from heat and let sit until desired consistency is reached.

so good!  i love garlic so i added 3 cloves of crushed garlic to the butter as it was melting, then added the cream, let it warm up, then added the cheese 1/2 cup at a time and stirred between each 1/2 cup.  i also added about a tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley when i took it off the heat.  added 16oz of cooked fettucine and some grilled chicken.  i will definitely be making this again!!!  delicious!

I have been making this same recipe for over 20 years except I add a dash of nutmeg.  Always perfect and delish!  The key is to use high quality ingredients...real butter, heavy cream, and freshly grated cheese.  The dry stuff in the green can will not work.

I chose this recipe because it is simple.  Our tastebuds have been so conditioned by the americanized garbage spat out by Olive Garden and the like, that we don't recognize how delicious simple foods can be.  If you watch a cook from the "old country" (choose any country), you will note they use very few ingredients, but the magic is in the technique.

My only gripe with the recipe as written is that everything is put in the saucepan at the same time.  As other reviewers have stated, do not do this.  Heat the cream on medium until slightly bubbling around the edges, where it comes in contact with the side of the saucepan.  Add the butter until melted, stirring constantly.  Add cheese, a small handful at a time, until melted.  Again, stirring constantly.  You MUST stand over this and stir it or it will burn on medium and will not come out good.  No, you can't put it on low and walk away.

We put this on a pizza with some grilled chicken and broccoli for a completely decadent meal.  Thank you to the author for sharing such a simple, yet delicious, recipe.

I had to make it twice to make sure I wasn't imagining how simple this was, and how great it tastes!  I too was skeptical with just three ingreds, but am a believer now! I've used my mother's recipe for years and it's loaded with egg yolks. I'm returning mom's recipe in the back of the card files and using Kathy Rose's from now on!! We're garlic lovers so I did saute some in the butter before adding the moo juice and cheese as well as some chopped parsley at the end of cook time for visual effect. Simmered chicken breast fillet in a bit of white wine, fettuchini topped with this sauce. I knew it was good as my guys didn't even make time for conversation; they were too busy stuffing their faces!!  Thx so much Kathy Rose!!  Salut!

Very easy base recipe for alfredo sauce. This was the first time I have made the sauce and I did add some garlic and sauteed it in the butter, then added the cream slowly and then the cheese - I also added a bit of nutmeg and pepper as other people mentioned. I will say I was surprised but this lacked a bit of salt. That's the only thing I would add next time. Oh and just to be even naughtier, I added pre-cooked bacon bits to the pasta. :)

This is a very good recipe, but for the true Alfredo taste, I also add 1/2 cup of freshly grated Romano cheese, whisked in along with the Parmesan 1/2 cup at a time to prevent clumping.

I just made this sauce like 10 minutes ago.  I used it over left over spaghetti and added kielbasa and now it's in the oven for 30 minutes.  I didn't have parmesan cheese so I used medium cheddar cheese and added garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, sea salt, black pepper and some parsley and it tastes heavenly.....YUM is all I have to say :))  Thank you!

I used freshly grated parmesan, added it slowly to the cream/butter mixture, cooked and stirred over medium heat ... and stirred, and stirred, and stirred until it had reduced to almost nothing. The first few bits of cheese first formed a clump, then when I eventually got that broken up, it never did dissolve into the liquid completely. It smelled great and tasted OK, but the consistency was terrible, especially after being added to pasta where it really separated.

This is an excellent recipe.  I think that maybe the problem for some is that you might be using the grated parmesan cheese from a can.  If you take a block of fresh parmesan and grate it your self and then melt it (slowly) into the whipping cream and butter, you will find it to be heavenly smooth and silky.  Fresh, real parmesan cheese will not produce a grainy , globby texture. Add some fresh sauteed mushrooms and steamed broccoli or cauliflower and you have a hit!

I've been using the recipe for years. It's soo quick, easy and very tasty. The only difference is I use half n half cream, 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 egg yolk and fresh romano cheese (instead of parm cheese). My family loves it.

This is the way I learned to make Alfredo sauce, except I have always used fresh garlic and white pepper in the mix. And it's quick and easy. But, like most of the rest I have refined it for various reasons. The biggest reason is: if (and that's a big if) there are any leftovers, this sauce will separate when refrigerated, and no amount of stirring or coaxing will get it to come back together. I now add a little flour and cut down on the butter to act as a binder; it makes a very thin white roux. Proceed as the recipe says and add cheese, and other spices to taste, thinning with a little milk if the sauce thickens too much because of the flour. Voila, a sauce that can be reheated if necessary.

'Bout time I review this one I think, I've used it many times! It's super easy and it's a great plain alfredo sauce and I don't feel it needs any additional seasoning or ingredients. It's perfect for a bigger-portion-than-I-should-eat bowl of comforting pasta. If you want additional flavour, add it onto your pasta after you've mixed the noodles into the sauce. I usually eat it plain but also like black pepper or a little crushed red pepper and/or even more parmesan cheese!

This was great - I made half the amount and I wish I'd made the whole receipe! I used it to top a "white" pizza and wow! It was perfect. I added some black pepper and nutmeg at the very end, that was my only change. This one is a keeper!

The trick to this recipe is fresh garlic.  Trust me.  If you melt some fresh garlic in butter in your pan before beginning, it turns out absolutely wonderful!
Tastes identical to the Olive Garden.  I promise you!  My husband and I make this all the time!

I am a novice at making sauce, but I made this sauce the other night and it was very easy to make and it was very delicious.  I love garlic so I just added a little grated garlic to the sauce, served it with some grill chicken.  I will not be buying jar Alfredo sauce from the store again.  Thanks.

I use something similar to this recipe for lots of dishes (but most especially pastas with chicken and vegetables and omelettes). I toss in a T. of flour, a sprinkling of dried parsley, some garlic powder and some ground pepper while the sauce is simmering. Sometimes I include mozzarella or cheddar cheese, too. I'm constantly whisking as it thickens. When I serve, I sprinkle some nutmeg or paprika over the top of the offering. I love this sauce.

This recipe was fantastic!  Even my "picky" daughter said it was good.  I sauteed some fresh garlic with the melting butter, then added the cream and allowed to combine before gradually adding the parmesan cheese and stirring constantly.  I used the Kraft grater which allowed for fine grating/easier melting.  Thickened up well after allowing to simmer.  Served over tortellini with some peas and bacon.  Yum!

This is absolutely fabulous. I have made it so many times; it is so easy. 
I often will substitute the heavy whipping cream for half and half, or do 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 half and half to make it stretch. Don't use milk. I made that mistake once and won't be doing it again. 
Add a little garlic powder, and you've got restaurant alfredo sauce on your stovetop.

This is an awesome recipe, and the taste and texture is spot on. The only issue is that the directions are not the best, and this is why I only gave the recipe 4 stars. I think that many people had an issue with this recipe (though it still has a great rating overall), because the directions pretty much say 'put everything in the pot and cook.' I've made many a cheese sauces and if you follow those directions, you'll end up with grainy or weird textured sauce. The way I make it is I melt the butter, then add the heavy whipping cream. Bring it to a very small simmer, and slowly add the cheese. I literally add a pinch of cheese, stirring constantly and not adding more cheese until the cheese I added melts completely. Once all the cheese is incorporated and the sauce is smooth, I cover the pot, turn it to low and let it sit for about 10 minutes. As far as a few people not liking the taste...I don't know what to say. This is the true taste of a perfect alfredo sauce!

I used to work at a small Italian restaurant and this is the way they made alfredo but usually added an egg yolk to help thicken it.  Really good.  Much better than the preservative flavored sauces in a jar and basically foolproof.

Oh my goodness! This was a great starter recipe. I followed another reviewer advice and slowly added the cheese to the hot cream/butter mixture, stirring constantly.  Then to take it up a step, I added a couple of handfuls of thawed, and pressed dry, frozen spinach; a very large clove of fresh garlic (pressed); and some pepper. I served this over spaghetti squash (my favorite 'pasta') and it was totally awesome!  My hubby said it was "excellent!" Thanks for this recipe!

Great sauce for pasta. I heated the cream, whisked in the butter in chunks, then sprinkled in the freshly grated parmesan a little at a time. It seemed thin, so I let it set for 10 minutes and it did, indeed, thicken up as the recipe described. The kids even loved it.

This is the perfect base sauce!  Since there are few things my kids will eat, and this is one of their favorites, we have this once a week for pasta night.  I use unsalted real butter, Frigo shaved Parmesan cheese, and just Great Value brand whipping cream.  I dump all three ingredients in the pan at once and then set my burner to the "melt" setting.  Just put it on the lowest setting if yours doesn't have a "melt" function.  I keep it this low until the butter is completely melted, stirring occasionally.  Once the butter is melted, crank it up to medium and let the cheese start melting...it WILL melt and meld, promise!  Once the cheese is melted and it's all stringy, I crank up the heat another couple of notches and let it come to a rolling boil, stirring constantly.  Let it boil one minute...that's how you get it smooth.  Now let's talk flavor.  I like very flavorful alfredo sauce.  I add salt to taste, several fresh basil leaves, and garlic powder to taste.  I add these extras at the beginning.  Hope that helps for those of you saying this was bland or that their were timing issues with melting the cheese!

What a great, easy base recipe.  I added a good amount of fresh coarse ground black pepper.  I used it over sauteed vegatables and pasta.  I agree with the reviews that half the recipe is enough for one pound of pasta.

The perfect alfredo, whether as is or as a jumping off point! It really is luscious just the way it's written- I like that the sauce derives its flavor from the cheese, but you can certainly add garlic, and whatever else you like.
I made it as written, browned some boneless chicken breasts, dropped them in the sauce to cover, and then put it all in the crock pot for 5 hours on low. served it over linguini with a big green salad and bread--my family ate everything! 
Thanks for a lovely recipe! I'll never use another alfredo sauce recipe!

Great base recipe. I sauteed shallots and mushrooms, then added all the butter and cream. Then very slowly added an italian cheese mixture about a 1/2 cup at a time until I got the consistency I was looking for. Fabulous!

I didn't add anything extra, and it smells/tastes great! I followed the suggestion to melt butter first, and add cheese a little at a time. My 1.5 QT saucepan was not big enough - it boiled over a little.

This is the exact base I have been using for years. It's wonderful because you can do so many different things with it! I always add white pepper and a couple of cloves of garlic. It turns out okay with canned Parmesan cheese, but I would definitely recommend using freshly grated. My favorite addition is shredded zucchini and mushrooms, but it's awesome by itself or with chicken, too!

This is an excellent recipie! I had a small problem with the consistancy, because i added all of the cheese at once. Instead of heavy whipping cream, i used half and half.

LOVE this recipe! I made this for the first time last night and my family loved it! I even had to make substitutions because I didn't have enough heavy cream on hand. I used half and half and a smallish wedge of fresh Romano cheese grated and it melted smoothly and completely. I melted the butter first (real butter), then added the half and half, brought it up to a simmer then slowly added the grated cheese while whisking constantly. When the cheese was all incorporated, I removed it from the heat while the pasta finished cooking and it thickened up perfectly!   The method to making this sauce reminds me of making a cheese fondue. This is a keeper in our household now!

This is the ONLY recipe I found that had what I wanted in my sauce.  I use a LOT of garlic salt and garlic powder and it makes the sauce AMAZING!!  I had my family come over and they ate this and NO ONE believed I made the sauce from scratch! lol

EDIT**I still use and love this recipe...tip for it is once you add the cheese, take it off the heat or the cheese will become gritty and gross.  The heat from the cream and butter will melt the cheese.

Great base alfredo sauce! I added fresh minced garlic to my butter and Italian seasoning at the end. Next time, I will add more ingredients for additional flavor. Obviously, all leftovers need to be thrown out. Alfredo NEVER reheats well. No matter where it is from. Always separates in the microwave. I have heard there is a way to do it on the stove top, heating slowly. I have never tried it though.

I was looking for an alfredo sauce that I could stomach.  the store bought alfredo is AWEFUL!!!  I found this recipe read the reviews and thought I would give it a try.  VERY GOOD!!!  I will be making my own from now on.

  I did make a couple of changes though.  I didn't have heavy cream so used half and half.  I also added a couple pinches of garlic powder.  and about 1 tablespoon shredded parm.  It is wonderful sauce.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Good, but you have to add some additional seasonings. I added garic and onion powder and salt and pepper, and served it with chicken that I sauteed in olive oil, basil, and garlic. I also mixed in some broccoli. And put extra shredded parm and romano on top. ( I shredded fresh parm for the sauce) My husband really liked this and so did my 18 month old daughter (she loves pasta and she loves broccoli so this was great for her). Will make again I'm sure.

I used a chunk of parmesan that started to get rough, so it didn’t fully melt. I liked the flavor and for a quick meal to make for dinner when I get home at 12 AM its perfect!

I screwed this one up. All the cheese sank to the bottom of the pan and burned.  It was a pain to clean. I blame myself though - I had the heat up too high and didn't stir enough. I would stress doing this over LOW heat and stirring A LOT. I somewhat saved it and it tasted fine.  The concept is good, the direction was bad but if I am brave I will make it again.

I was looking for a basic alfredo sauce and found it.  Thank you for sharing.  I used 1/2 fresh parmesan and 1/2 Three Cheese Blend(Parmesan, Romano, Asiago)  The different cheeses added a nice kick to the sauce.  Thanks again, Missy

To those who found it bland - add a bit of nutmeg, then salt and pepper to taste, and it'll be wonderful. =) I often add a bit of Romano cheese to the mixture, as well.

I added 3 cloves fresh crushed garlic and 1-1/2cups sliced mushrooms to the butter and cooked them before adding the cream and cheese.  Served with breaded chicken breasts.  Quick and easy, and very delicious!  Thanks for the great sauce recipe!

This sauce is Wonderful! So quick and easy, I'll never buy jarred alfredo sauce again when I can make this. Thickens a lot when standing, so don't overcook for thickness. I used asiago cheese the second time I made it and it was even better- also helps cut down on the grainy texture that sometimes occurs with parmesan.

Just made it tonight and it turned out wonderful! Basically I've ruined Alfredo entree's at restaurants for me and my husband now forever. As some other commentators said, as long as you use medium to medium high heat and add everything slowly it turns out just perfect. We like a lot of garlic at my house, so we were heavy on the garlic and for me Alfredo is not Alfredo with out a bit of black pepper and parsley. Super easy, super fast and way better then anything you can buy in a jar.

Like many of the other reviewers, I was making this for my husband whose mother was Italian and my husband was spoiled by "real" Italian food.  My husband loved this sauce!  I read both the positive and negative reviews.  I took the advice of many and added the grated Parmesan in small batches.  It seemed a bit runny so I added more cheese which it turned out was not really needed.  Thank you for posting this recipe!!

Instead of the heavy whipping cream I used low fat evaporated condensed milk. And it was wonderful. I'm not a fan of Alfredo sauce in the restaurant, but at home...YUM! My husband loves Fettuccine Alfredo so I had to make it in order to keep him happy!

I originally got this recipe from an Italian lady and it is the only one that I use.  My son called me from college wanting the recipe so that he could make it for his roommates.  I melt my butter first, then add the cream and heat before I add the parmesan cheese.  I keep adding cheese until it is as thick as I like it.  Sometimes I will add garlic, sometimes not.

First time I made this sauce and it was wonderful.  I read the reviews and melted the butter first, added the whipped cream, and very slowly added the parmesan (only had 1 1/4 c).  I whisked constantly on med then went to simmer to give me time to heat the chicken and frozen broccoli.  I added 1/2 tsp of garlic pwd, basil, S&P and threw some parsley in before I added the parmesan.  My husband and I loved it.  We had it with broccoli and grilled chicken, but I did not mix it together until served.  This is def a keeper.  And yes, it is as good if not better than Olive Garden.

All I added was a couple of cloves of minces garlic and some salt and pepper. Yummmmm. I added some grilled chicken. OMG. This was really delish. I also tossed some asparagus in olive oil, salt and pepper and coated them in the cheapo parm and grilled them for a wonderful side dish. Good base recipe.

Tried this recipe tonight.  My son said that it was a repeatable meal after only a couple of bites.  I followed the recipe and added sautéed chicken pieces with garlic. Goodbye jarred Alfredo sauce.  Thank you for a terrific addition to our menu rotation.

This sauce tasted pretty good (I added some garlic powder for flavor) but it didn't thicken at all. Worked for my leftovers but would need to be better for a main course.

Enjoyed the finished product, as I began to cook I realized that this is only a base so one would have to season to taste. Also I didn't add as much cheese i added 3/4 cup instead, totally forgot that one would have to add cheese slowly, so it wasn't smooth at first... For all those people that added the cheese all at once, it's okay add some chicken both to thin it but stir as you add, then season to taste. I promise it will come out great.

So easy, and so yummy.  We use fresh parmesan, grated in our Oskar.  Mix everything together constantly until melted.  Don't get heat too high or it will start to burn. I usually do it on medium heat for a little bit, stirring, and then turn it down.

Serve over pasta mixed with chicken and steamed broccoli.

I made this and did as suggested to add cheese gradually.  This is the best alfredo sauce I've ever made and tasted.  I hate the stuff in the jars, this is WONDERFUL!  Thanks for sharing it!

This was an easy and very successful recipe. On medium low, as the recipe called for, I melted the butter first, then added the cream slowly (1/4 of the pint at a time) and then added the cheese slowly (about 1/4 at a time). I don't know if that made a difference or not (adding things slowly)but it worked well. I served poured it over about 6 servings of fettuccine and with about 2 lbs of cooked chicken breast. Delicious!

This sauce was simple and heaven...What I did was melt the butter slowly (so that it doesn't brown), then I added the cream and because I needed more sauce than what the recipe called for and only had a cup and half of heavy cream I also added to that half and half (for my volume). After that simmered for about 5-10 minutes I grated a pinch of nutmeg, a pinch of sea salt, incorporated some fresh ground pepper (medium grind), and fresh Parmesan/Mozzarella cheese mixture. The end result was a white sauce which was velvet over a bed of noodles.

very good and very easy. i especially like this because it's inexpensive, i don't know why i ever spent money on the jars. the only thing i didn't like was the leftovers were very greasy from all the butter... maybe less next time. but a good base recipe.

This is so delicious, and so easy!  There's no need to ever buy a jar of alfredo sauce when it's so easy and delicious to make it!  Per another review I did add 1/2tsp basil and 1/2tsp italian seasoning, and some minced garlic. Could use a little more of each but it was awesome!!

Very good recipe, I found it a little hard to get the sauce smooth, but it still was really good, also I added garlic seasoning and salt and pepper, and I added some sun dried tomato feta cheese as well. Very very good, even the leftovers were spectacular.

I've been making alfredo for a couple dozen years and agree this is the very best base to make a yummy creamy cream sauce. On a side note, I find it frightening that so many use  Olive Garden as a point of comparison!

I made it with fresh grated 3 cheeses
Parm, asiago and romano
with a little garlic
was EXACTLY like olive garden. 
but sauce wasn't as smooth. 
maybe I added to much cheese? 
Or maybe I should have used a blender?

This turned out perfectly!  Those who complained of it being too "gritty" probably used that parmesan "cheese" in the green can.  Buy yourself a chunk of Parmigiano Reggiano, grate it yourself, and the sauce will turn out as smooth as silk!

I decided to alter this just a little bit.  I added garlic and Italian seasonings as well as some spinach (as I am always trying to sneak vegetables in where my kids won't notice).  I served it over cheese tortellini and it was a fast, easy TASTY meal with a very nice salad. YUM!

I rarely comment on recipes, but this deserved special note.  Yes, it doesn't taste like store bought or restaurant made, but this is "the real thing."  The only way to make it more authentic is to add fresh cheese, grated right off the wheel, to the sauce, grate your pepper right into the sauce, and add a pinch of fresh ground nutmeg (yes, nutmeg).  The last is critical -- it will add a lot of flavor, and make the cheese flavors come alive.  Mange, mange!!

I will give this 2 stars for flavor.  I don't know what I could have done wrong with such a simple recipe but it just never thickened.....until it was stone cold.  Cheaper and easier to buy the stuff in the jar with better results.

This recipe is outstanding! After reading many of the reviews and seeing mixed results like too thin or too thick/grainy I think a couple of key points of the recipe were left out: Simmer means hot but never boiling. You should see steam rising from the sauce. The cheese should be fresh. Use a block of Parmesan and grate what you need with a grater. The key point here is to make the cheese as light and as small as possible so that it melts very quickly. I used a 1/2 cup of Parmesan and included 3/4 cup of Mozzarella that came pre-shredded in a bag to make it melt quickly. When adding both cheeses, add just a little at a time to completely incorporate before adding more. Stir frequently. To kick the sauce up a bit I did the following: I ground just a tiny amount of fresh nutmeg to give the sauce a unique flavor, two additional cloves of garlic, I sauted baby bella mushrooms in butter in a separate pan that were added to the sauce at the very end. I grilled two chicken breasts and sliced very thin and added to the sauce at the end.  Last, I chopped up a 1/2 cup of fresh sweet Basil that was added as a garnish atop everything--fabulous!

This recipe was so simple, but so good! I used the regular parmesan in the shaker, like most folks have. I melted the butter in the pan first and poured the cream over that, then whisked in the parmesan. I also cooked it with a fresh sage leaf, and some italian seasoning. I also add a little bit of pepper in the end and it is so tastey! Not low fat, but worth it for the splurge.

This sauce was fantastic and so easy to make!  My boyfriend is extremely picky about his alfredo sauce, won't even consider most of the Italian restaurants out there, but he LOVED this and requests it over and over.  I did add a little garlic and some salt to jazz it up a bit, and it is a hit at my house!  Thank you for such an easy, delicious recipe.

I made the sauce, tasted it and decided it meeded some garlic as others had suggested. Excellent taste after I added the garlic.

I made this again, this time substituting half and half for whipping cream. I also added milk and a bag of Italian shredded cheese, Italian seasoning and garlic powder. It was still great. I love this recipe!  Its a great start and wonderful as is. 

I messed up on this recipe and accidentally added 1 and 1/2 cups of butter instead of parmesian.  To fix it, I added more parmesian, some fat free skim milk, and some fat free half & half as I only had the one pint of heavy creme.  It was fantastic!  I also added two to three cloves of fresh minced garlic, a little salt, and some pepper.  I served it over angel hair pasta and topped with grilled chicken and shrimp.  I will definitely make this again.

This was really good.  I warmed up the whipping cream before adding the butter, which I cut up in small pieces first...after the butter was melted I added the Parmesan a little at a time.  I also added salt, pepper and some garlic powder.  Stirred the sauce in with some penne pasta, cut up meatballs, sundried tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms and some crushed chili pepper.  It was FaBuLoUs!  I was told that was the BEST pasta dish they had ever eaten!! (Sauce ended up very thin, but pasta soaked it up)

This recipe is super easy. I had no problems with consistency or anything. I just added some ground black pepper and a couple of dashes of garlic powder and it was wonderful.

this recipe is really awesome. I know its been said before but they key is adding cheese 1/2/ cup at a time. My family gets so excited everytime i make it and it is so simple. I make it with shrimp instead of chicken. Sometimes i add both for an added treat.

Okay, to the submitter:  THANK YOU!  THANK YOU!  THANK YOU!  This sauce makes enough for 2 lbs of pasta, my family loves it, and it's easy enough for my teenager to make for herself!  This recipe couldn't be easy, yet maintains the integrity of the more complicated alfredos...no need to bend over backward ever again, this is the best!

This is the best recipe for Alfred sauce and one I use often.  Like other revierws advised, the Parmesan must be added slowly.  Also, I never substitute margarine - it just does not do it justice.   Adding fresh garlic is an option and any herbs you choose.  There are endless possibilities.  It is simple, made with ingredients we normally have and always, always great.

Good.  I cut some of the calories and fat by using fat free half and half and wisking in 1/4 c flour to help thicken it a bit.  Also added garlic per other reviews.  Just don't boil it or it will curdle.

Great easy recipe-I add garlic as well as someone already mentioned.  Also, for a healthier option, I toss in cooked chopped spinach with the pasta (I usually use tortellini).  I'm sure you can use other veggies such as broccoli and it would taste great!

Awesome recipe :) Realy good alfredo base -- it can be eaten just as is, or combined with other things. My favorite is to add broccoli and salmon chunks.

I was looking for a very cheap, easy, and tasty alfredo sauce, and this was definately the right one for me.  I don't like a super rich sauce, and this one had the perfect amount of cheese and butter to make it creamy, and not enough to give me a stomach ache.  I highly recommend it!

This was a lot like Olive Gardens alfredo sauce but I wouldn't say its identical.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, italian seasoning, chive, onion powder.  Served with fettuccine noodles.  I loved it and definitely will make again.

This is the BEST Alfredo sauce out there.  I haven't found a Restaurant to come close to beating this recipe.  My husband LOVES it!  It's great for LOW CARB dieting too.  You just have to get creative on what to put it on.  I have put it over steamed cabbage, cauliflower and brussle sprouts.

This sauce was soooooooo easy and delicious. I added nutmeg to the recipe and it made it delicious. Prior to making the sauce I roasted red peppers and garlic and then sauted those 2 ingredients with sun dried tomatoes. i added that to the sauce before pouring it over the pasta. my husband LOVED it. Also, I tried adding the parmesean cheese a little at a time and found that to be a very helpful tip!!!! This is being added to my recipe box for sure!!! Thank you so much Kathy!!!

I was encouraged by the positive reviews to make this sauce. But once I made it, I regretted it. It was bland, flavourless, and no matter how long I cooked it, the parmesan seemed to clump together. Good in a pinch, but all I could really taste was the cream.

This sauce was alright. I used the grated parmesan in the can and it also turned out grainy. I added some broccoli and poured it over penne pasta. It was good. Next time I will use fresh grated paremesan.

This sauce tasted pretty good. I used the shredded cheese instead of the grated like others had suggested. But I had a hard time keeping the cheese off the bottom of the pan even with constant stirring. So eventually some of it ended up burned at the bottom of the pan. So for cleanup it isnt that great of a dish. But I give it an overall 4 stars because it did taste alot like restaraunt alfredo.

It was very easy, but the grated parmesan didn't melt well.. so it had a grainy texture...

Excellent sauce.  Easily sticks to the pan, but that comes with the territory.  Delicious.

So easy to make. My husband,son, and I all think this recipe is a keeper. All of us went back for seconds. We used chicken. I think shrimp would taste great as well with this sauce.

Great, easy recipe. It's been said before, but it's worth repeating. Use FRESH parmesan that you grate yourself. Don't buy the bagged stuff or the green can. The pre-shredded bagged parmesan has a coating to keep it from sticking together and clumping up...this WILL impact your alfredo sauce in a bad way if you use it. Take the time and grate your own! It will be worth it to have creamy alfredo sauce.

The first time I made this, I wasn't impressed. However, I did personalize it by sautéing minced garlic before adding the cream and parmesan. I add fresh parsley once it is complete. My family loves it - even my son who hates cream sauces.

Very bland. When you add the cheese, add a little at a time and whisk or stir constantly. Watch your heat because if it's too high, the butter and cream will separate. There's other Alfredo recipes on this site that are much better.

I think its decent, I would recommend adding some garlic paste or crushed fine at the beginning. Also I would recommend fresh parsley at the very end. Note for reuse: if you take this sauce with the garlic and parsley and add some flour just to thicken. refrigerate over night, it makes a great pizza sauce for chicken alfredo pizza.

The very 1st time I tried this (last summer) I made half the recipie as it was just 2 of us and it was perfect - I melted butter first then added minced garlic and simmer just til fragrent then cream mixed til warm and barely simmering before I added cheese. I used shredded parm not the grated and just a bit at a time stirring it it before adding more. Cooking seemed to take a bit longer than the 15 minutes. Have tried over and over to "recreate" that first time but just not the same! Still a delicious recipe that I have continued to make-its whats for dinner tonight with sauteed shrimp on top. Thanks for recipe!

I love good recipes with very few ingredients and this one fits the bill! I added cooked shrimp and peas to this sauce and poured it over fettuccine noodles. It has become a family favorite and I have passed it on to several people. Thank you Kathy Rose.

I am slightly addicted to Olive Garden's Alfredo sauce, so I was very leery. But this is awesome!!! Add a cl8ve of garlic and its perfect. Stiring constantly and slowly, as well as adding the cheese {I used Shredded Asiago, and about a cup of grated Parmasean (sp)} in increments helped it thicken very well. Super excited to add this recipe to my list of things I can make whenever I want to.

This is outstanding! Took several of the reviewers tips (shredded parmesan, not grated; little bit of garlic powder; melted butter then added cream, then cheese) and it was just out of this world!! Quick, easy, delicious...doesn't get much better than that! Thanks Kathy Rose and reviewers!!

Wow! Just made this for a side for dinner tonight. I made it by the recipe. Heated up the butter and cream slowly added the parm. Grated from a block. Cooked on med low and turned out FANTISIC. Now I will try it with garlic ect but it is great just like it is. Never again will I buy that nasty stuff in the jar. Thank you for the great recipe!

I loved this recipe. It is not bad at all. I encourage you to follow the recommendations from CHEFSINGLEDAD. If you do, you should not be disappointed. The key is to be PATIENT to let the cheese melt properly at MEDIUM heat while stirring it and do not toss the cheese all at once. I also use a whisker to make sauces and for this particular one I use a hint of nutmeg. I did not have grated parmesan. I had shredded and it came out perfectly fine following his suggestions. Put salt and pepper to your taste...

The only reason I am giving this is a 4 is because my son did not like it. (He is 9) My husband and I both loved it. Tastes so much like Olive Garden.. I cooked chicken in olive oil and garlic and it was wonderful. The sauce did not thicken up at first but by the time we ate it, it was great !! Thank you for the recipe. 2 of us enjoyed it...

I don't think I've added any recipe to more than 2 locations in my Recipe Box...until this one!  Side dish, Main dish and Family Favorite.  By far better than anything out of a jar, 3 ingredients..okay, 4 with a dash of garlic powder.  Have had Alfredo sauce in a big name restaurant and it was overpowered by waaaay too much garlic!  Tasted like a garlic chowder.  Not good.  I have made this recipe as written: plain, with broccoli; and with broccoli and chicken.  GK's love it and when DH took it to work he called home for the recipe to share with co-workers.  Fast, simple and delicious, my kind of cooking. Can't ask for more!!

I followed directions exactly but the sauce was WAY too thin for my liking!  I did add some fresh garlic to the butter as it melted and slowly added the cheese after the heavy cream was hot.  The flavor was good but it never thickened up as stated.  I'll have to add something to make it more sauce like - cream cheese?  Cornstarch?  I think I'll go back to my other recipe.  Waste of pricy cream and cheese!!

I use this recipe all the time. As I have seen mentioned in reviews if you like more flavor, add it. I melt the butter first and then saute garlic for about 1-2 minutes and then add the cream. I bring that to just below a boil, do not boil. Then slowly add the parmesan. Then I add white pepper to my taste. The garlic and white pepper were part of the recipe I have but otherwise the recipes are identical. A very easy quick recipe that leaves you room to make it your own.

Yes!!!  The base ingredients are good. But if you want to add a kick to it, add about 3-4 Tbsp of Sherry wine, about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and some fresh ground pepper.  Now you got a sauce!!!

Love this! I have tried other alfredo recipes that require more ingredients, more effort and more time. This recipe is better -- and I consider myself an Italian foodie. My recommendation is to use fat-free half & half and use about half of the butter. It still tastes fantastic but not quite so decadent. I also add ground black pepper.

As with any base sauce seasoning and additional flavors are personal preferences.  I like to bring cream to a low simmer.  Add cheese in 3 parts stirring until each is completely melted.  Follow this with the butter in the same way.  Season to taste with salt and pepper(I use white pepper on this sauce).  To hold reduce heat to lowest.  Don't let this boil, it will break.

Incredible!

One of my fav go to fast dinners is sausage with noodles in Alfredo sauce with boiled veggies like zucchini and broccoli.

I have only ever used the store bought jar stuff. I had no idea how easy and delishes it is to make it your self!! I love limiting the preservatives I feed my family.

Both my husband and I just loved this recipe!! It is now in the rotation.

It was very easy. I did add salt n pepper n garlic powder. Sooooo good!

Its a very good sauce. I cut back a little on the unsalted butter and add some olive oil. Also, if you wanna take it to the next level, use fresh parsley (I chop it very fine) and garlic. Gruyere cheese is very good mixed in as well. Good as it is, or as a base recipe that you customize as you wish.

Super easy and so tasty - much better than the packaged, pre-made Alfredo sauces you get at the grocery store, which tend to have a lot of other ingredients you don't really need.  I agree with the reviewer who noted that you get the best results from adding the Parmesan cheese slowly, and stirring continuously.  Also, I used Parmesan-Romano, which gave it a little extra zip, and real butter (unsalted), which does make a difference flavor-wise. I figure, as long as you don't have it every day, there's nothing wrong with this - it uses real ingredients and not a bunch of chemical additives, and you can truly say it's homemade!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, however, it should include that you need to add the cheese SLOWLY. From the way the recipe is written it looks like you just put it all into a sauce pan and let it do its thing. It should also explain that stirring it frequently helps. It is a good recipe (as far as ingredients go) but not a good recipe as far as directions go.

I had to fix it. Even without all the cream called for, it was still too liquidy so I put it back on the heat, boiled it good, finally added a little arrowroot slurry, whisked out lumps, and then it was thick. Tasted bitter from the parmesan. Next time I'm using Parmigiano Reggiano, not an off-brand block. I whisked in a few ounces of cream cheese and it was fine. My mom said it was the best alfredo she's had. If you want easy and gluten-free, I like this technique. Next time I'll keep the cream cheese and just leave time to cook it down until it's thick. Good stuff, thanks for the recipe!

Amazing sauce, and my first truly successful alfredo! Started by sweating a couple of cloves of chopped garlic in butter, whisked in cream, pinch of nutmeg and then cheese.  Just keep stirring.

I loved this recipe. I've read some people find it to bland but for me (and I'm a more simple type of girl) I loved it. My husband and kids couldn't eat it fast enough. And for people who love to experiment and add things this is really a great base. It made it following the recipe the first time and the second time I added fresh garlic. It was great both times!

Out of all the sauces that I have tried, my boyfriend loves this the most. Of course, I love it too. It is simple and delicious. I always add about 3 cloves of garlic and some mushrooms to complete this recipe.

Could not have been easier or more delicious.  I added some garlic powder, black pepper and thyme for added flavor.  My husband and I are on the Atkins diet and the premade Alfredo sauce has corn starch and other fillers we didn't want.  We had this over chicken and vegetables and it was terrific.

This is a perfect example of a simple recipe that takes a bit of practice. I've work as a cook for many, many years, this is basically the recipe I've used. Your sauce needs to get hot, but never let bubble. I like to use small amounts of white pepper. It takes practice but if you've eaten a dish with alfrado in a restraunt this is the base recipe.

I was in a hurry when I made this recipe, so I didn't read the helpful hints from previous users.   I also accidentally used Romano cheese instead of Parmesan.  Nonetheless, this is a great recipe.  The Romano made it a little salty, so I added some light cream to mellow it out, along with nutmeg and white pepper.  I used it over linguine and sauteed skinless boneless chicken thighs, and baked it in the oven at 450 for about 15 minutes.  My ten-year-old daughter said it was "superb."

This didn't turn out well for me. I used unsalted butter and fresh grated Parmesan (bought in tubs from the grocery store). On medium low heat, it took forever to heat, and the cheese didn't properly melt. The texture was grainy and not very thick, the taste was extremely salty. In the past I've made Alfredo sauce with the grated cheese in the green can that came out better. I probably messed up, but the recipe could benefit from some timing directions.

This was pretty good. I'm not an Alfredo aficionado; I've had it before, but I'm probably not as picky as people who love it. I don't think I'd ever made it from scratch before, but this was pretty easy (I made it exactly as written), and turned out well. Even a leftover portion, refrigerated and reheated the next night, turned out just fine (I was worried about that). A bit decadent, but I'd recommend it if someone wants a quick and easy Alfredo.

Wonderful. Chefsingledad's comments were spot on. I'm so glad I made this! No bottled stuff for me anymore. And he's right, it's a base. I added a couple cloves of garlic, and now that I know what this sauce is like, next time I'll add some other fresh seasonings. This is a keeper! Thanks to Kathy Rose.

I loved this sauce! The only change that I made was that I added a pinch of cinnamon (random I know) but delicious! Also this sauce reheats very well! I also use this recipe for any recipe that requires Alfredo. This is better than the Alfredo in the jar!

This is a very good base.  It is very rich as is, which I love, but my husband likes it a little lighter, but it's really easy to adjust to your taste without ruining it's original yumminess.

Really bland.  Not much flavor and I used freshly grated parm.  What a shame considering I wasted a good chunk of my parm block and a whole stick of butter.  The thickness/texture was nice though.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did add tiny bit of onion and garlic with salt and pepper as recommended.  It was very easy and I will definitely make this recipe from now on.  Thanks

Very Very good.  Easy to make.  I will never buy store bought again.  Keeping in mind this is a base and easy to add spices, garlic and salt and pepper to.  My family loves when I make this.  We also like to add bacon, pepperoni, broccoli and chicken to the sauce right before it thickens.  I also keep some sauce on the side for left overs the next day.  This is a great recipe and very easy to make.  You can add whatever you want to please your family.

By far, the best alfredo sauce I've ever made.  It is very simple!  My husband asks me endlessly to make this for dinner.  It's really simple to add some shrimp or chicken as well.  LOVE this recipe!

Very yummy if done properly (put the ingredients in a little at a time, and is you use QUALITY ingredients it won't be a waste of your time.) Also...... My ex had a secret ingredient, a little nutmeg makes it just right. Of course I don't tell my current boyfriend who told me!

This was good, really good sauce for only having three ingredients. I usually make an alfredo sauce with cream cheese as a shortcut, and this one tasted a little more gritty than the other method. This one is more authentic so it's probably my technique. I will make this again if I don't have any cream cheese in the house, thanks for sharing.

Based on the prev reviews I added cream cheese, it did add a nice tang to it. I warmed it up slowly and then brought it to a near boil but I couldn't get the lumps smoothed out. I also used Kraft grated Parmesan & Romano cheese and like one reviewer said, it never became smooth. I used light whipping cream and only 1/4 c of butter. I heated it up slowly and worked it for over 25 min and finally gave up and ate. I added a splash of salt and quite a bit of black pepper. The flavor was great but the texture is gritty.

This was exactly what I was looking for! Simple to make, yet tastes terrific! My sauce didn't quite thicken, so I added some flour (I didn't measure it, but it was probably around 1/4 cup). I'll never use store-bought alfredo again!

This was delicious and made a fabulous Fettucine Alfredo. It was so easy but it sure wasn't fast. I cooked mine for over thirty minutes and the cheese was still not quite melted and was grainy and gritty, but we were getting hungry and just didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for dinner. It was still fantastic. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

This is a great easy base recipe. I would suggest adding some Romano and Asiago cheese for added sharpness and a pinch of nutmeg. We also added some cream cheese for extra creaminess, and if you want it thicker just add some flour. No Alfredo heats up well. If you slow heat it up on the stove it keeps from separating, but its not the same! FRESH cheese is always best

This is an amazing base for an alfredo sauce! To thicken, I wisked 2 T. flour. Add the noodles to help absorb the sauce. Also, we flavored with garlic powder and oregano. -OR- you could use parsley for a different taste. It was simply wonderful! My fam loved it.

I made this yesterday but had to make some major changes.  I used 1 pint of fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and wisked in enough flour to get the thick consistantcy one would get if using whipping cream.  Absolutly delicious and the calorie count came way down.  I added a large clove of finely minced garlic but I think it still needs more.

Great Recipe!  YOU MUST USE FRESH GRATED CHEESE, the kind you buy in the glass jar - I used the Parmesan/Romano blend...I also add about a teaspoon of pepper, three gloves of fresh crushed garlic, a dash of sea salt, a teaspoon of ground oregano, and a teaspoon of basil.  I use a whisk to start the cream, then add the butter by the teaspoon, add cheese slowly at the end, cook until cheese melts, then let sit off the burner for about five minutes to thicken.  I sauteed shrimp in a separate skillet in butter, garlic, sea salt, and italian seasoning until starting to crust, then put the alfredo over fresh cooked angel hair pasta with some shrimp on top - FANTASTIC - thanks so much Kathy for this base recipe!  I have never been able to eat jarred alfredo sauce, so you have expanded my meals  :)

I first melted the butter, and added a clove of minced garlic and some Italian seasoning, and let it cook in the melted butter for a minute or so.  I then added the cream and let it all warm up.  Lastly, I took others' advice and added the cheese a handful at a time.  I tossed this with some rotini pasta and sauteed mushrooms and sweet grape tomatoes that I had cooked with salt and garlic.  FANTASTIC.  Hubby and I both went for seconds!  Super easy, too.  Can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

Super easy and very tasty!  The kids love it and  I will definitely be making this again!  I would suggest adding onion powder, garlic powder, oregano and pepper:)  

Edit:  I made  this last night forgetting to add the butter and it tasted just as good.  I won't be adding butter to this recipe anymore:)

Great recipe.  I agree with previous reviewers.  Melt the butter first, then add the cream, and then slowly add the cheese little by little.  Perfect results!

This recipe is INCREDIBLE! I am a very picky Alfredo person and I can tell you, I will make this again & again! The key is definitely to do it slowly.. Heat each ingredient individually and put the cheese in little by little.. It may seem tedious but the outcome is great! I did add some minced garlic and salt & pepper to taste.. I actually ended up using a little LESS cheese because it was coming out a little too thick and it hadn't even settled yet.  I agree with other viewers where they say it's better than OG. Thanks for the Recipe!

This was very fast and easy to make, even for a beginner. I also included mushrooms and garlic salt to add a little more to it. Very nice!

I cannot tell you how many times I make this since finding it almost a year and a half ago.  We have not bought the jarred sauce since, and that used to be a family staple.  I even make it on pizza nights.  Sometimes we will order a pizza with no sauce and use the alfredo sauce for dipping.  Very yummy.  I've been known to use a dollop or two of ricotta cheese in it at times, and if the store is out of parmesan cheese (I live in the sticks, it happens.  lol) I'll get the italian blend cheese that has asiago, romano, parmesan and mozzarella.  That is really good.  Reminds me of the 5 cheese alfredo at one of my favorite Italian restaurants.

This was excellent- my bf actually licked his plate when he thought I wasnt looking, lol! He said it was better than his Italian mother's. I used light butter, light cream, and generic parm/romano mix from the shaker and it was still creamy, smooth and full of flavor!

This is a great recipe!  So simple.   I ended up halving the butter, because really, one stick of butter is just too much, and a whole stick is not needed.  The trick for me was to heat the cream and butter together until almost the boiling point, and THEN adding the grated parmesan or romano cheese.  It thickens up quickly.  I've been making this for years, and occasionally I've had it go grainy or curdle on me, and I have no idea why it happens...  if anyone does know, please post a response.  Still a great, yummy, simple recipe.  Thanks!!

This was really good, I accidentally added too much basil and it was still super.  I first melted the butter in the sauce pan then added the cream, then the cheese and spices (basil, oregano, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder)about a 1/2 tsp-3/4 tsp each.

After making this base sauce twice and adding different spices and fresh garlic it has become an all time favorite in our family.  When I start this sauce I always start with melting the butter then adding the cream and warming it up then finally add the cheese in handfuls as I stir it with a whisk.  This sauce takes time to meld the flavors and thicken.  It is not a heavy thick sauce.

The taste and simplicity of this sauce should be rated 5 stars but it never thickened up for me. I was disapointed but it was still good on our angel hair pasta. Not sure what went wrong.

Maybe I didn't take my time with this & that might have made all the difference, but my sauce was grainy, like the parmesean never fully melted. I only had half & half so I used that instead of whipping cream. THe sauce didn't thicken up like I hoped for so I had to thicken it with a little cornstarch which turned out great. I added about a tsp. of minced garlic, garlic powder, salt, pepper & a little nutmeg. The flavor was absolutally fabulous! I just wish it wasn't so grainy. Next time I will definatley add the cheese more slowly. I was in a big hurry this time but it still tasted wonderful!

Simple and flavorful. I would like to note that patience is a virtue when making this. You gotta add the cheese slow in small amounts, and wait for each addition to fully melt before adding more. It just takes a few extra minutes, and makes all the difference in the sauce. I added it to some angel hair pasta and simple grilled chicken breast for a meal. My husband cleaned his plate, and anything that makes him do that is a keeper in my household.

This alfredo sauce had a great taste but didn't thicken until after dinner! It needs to sit for about 30 mins before it will sit on the pasta instead of seeping to the bottom of the bowl! I added roasted garlic, pepper, salt and garlic powder!

This recipe is the best!  I fixed it with Shrimp and Fettucini noodles and the family loved it. I had to thicken it,I used 2T butter with 2T flour melted in separate pan and then add to sauce.  This is better than ANY I have ever tasted in restaurants!!

This is great for such a simple recipe.  First I saute a little minced garlic in the butter over medium/medium low heat.  Then add the heavy cream.  Do not bother to try with half&half or milk... you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  Do not allow the butter/cream mixture to boil!  Very slowly add your parmesan cheese otherwise you may get lumps while continuously wisking. Finally I add just a touch of nutmeg.  Per the recipe it is a little thick for my taste so I add just a touch of milk at the end to thin it out to my liking.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent. I doubled the recipe then followed the add-on advice about using fresh parmesan and adding it slowly, although I also added some of the shaker parmesan slowly towards the end for a stronger flavor. Also added 1/4 tsp garlic powder. My family loved it and now wants it all the time, but I think this will be an occasional treat due to fat and calorie  content.

This was soooo good. I can't believe that I ever bought alfredo sauce from a jar.  I followed other's advice and added the cheese slowly and continually stirred it with a whisk.  I added some italian seasoning, salt, pepper and garlic.  This is a keeper!

This was very good!  It kinda got a little thick,  so i added more heavy cream.  I made it for 2 servings, so I may have added too much or not enough of something.  The only thing I added was garlic salt and pepper, and i used reduced fat parmesan cheese (it's all i had).  Very good!

Very easy. Added some fresh garlic and white pepper for additional flavor. Fresh parmesan is a must.

My family loved this.  My husband who usually doesn't like alfredo (he doesn't like garlic) really enjoyed this.  I served it with a cheese tortallini.  My 5 year old ate every bite and even finished all his broccoli after he started dipping it in his left over sauce! I didn't make any changes and it was great.

This is an incredibly easy recipe that I have used for many different dishes.  I especially like it because one of my sons doesn't like tomato sauce on his spaghetti, so I can make this quickly and easily as an alternative.

This was great I added 1 tsp of cajun seasoning and used a mozzarella and parm blend and made cajun pasta with portabella mushrooms and red pepper. Yummy!

Fantastic base!  I added a dash of garlic salt, pepper, oregano and basil, added it to pasta with lemon pepper shrimp and it was delicious.  This recipe really allows me to play around and make the dish my own. My thanks to you.

I made this tonight with dinner. The flavor was awesome. I had cream, but turned out it was curdled, so I had to use 2% milk. I also used the shredded parmesan and I added a little garlic powder. The parmesan clumped together a bit and I added it slowly, 1/4 cup at a time. And it was a little thin, but I'm sure thats because I used milk. Very yummy though.

This was good, I think it would have been more successful with "shredded" parm rather then "grated".  The grated never really melted.  I wanted to cut some of the calories and fat so I used non-fat milk instead of cream.  The flavor was fine but it made a very thin sauce, I might try again with 2%.  And personally I think it needed a sprinkle of garlic powder.

This is so easy and so, so good!  I did add garlic to it because to us it's just not alfredo without it.  The kids ate it up and said it's the best food ever!

This recipe is super-easy and delicious.  I'd never made alfredo sauce before and it came out delicious.  I would add some garlic to the melting better and make sure you use fresh grated cheese.  A little fresh ground pepper and you're done!

This is a really tasty alfredo sauce and very easy to make. I recommend it for first time sauce makers. :)
Were I live heavy cream is not available (shocking I know!) so I had to substitute with evaporated milk. Also, it seemed thin to me so I added some corn starch to thicken it... Well, opps, added too much! It was way thicker than it needed to be. Not the recipes fault. :P Will make again!

Right now I'm giving this 4 stars.  It tasted phenomenal (I added a little garlic), but the texture wasn't quite what I wanted.  I added the parmesan in 1/2 cups, but I couldn't get it all to melt down- I still had little parmesan pieces in the sauce, and it seemed a little runny.  I added some cornstarch and ran it through the blender and it turned out satiny smooth and thick.  Lovely.


PS- this is amazing over gnocchi.

I went out and got the store bought alfredo sauce and it was the biggest mistake I made. I didn't have much time left, but decided to try this recipe anyway, and it worked out great. Not only is this recipe easy to make, but I tastes soooooo good!!! Thanx Kathy Rose!!!!

Wow, it was really good! The only thing I did differently are: 1. Simmer cream before adding cheese, 2.  Add 2 cloves of garlic, 3. Use unsalted butter (for baking) and add some sea salt, 4. Shred fresh permesan cheese and add small chunks at a time.

Another thing that is important is to use a quality pan (with thick bottom) so that the cheese won't burn.

I, too, brought the cream to a slow boil and added the butter then the cheese (in small amounts).  Absolutely delicious!!  I will NEVER buy jarred Alfredo sauce again!  (No need to since this is soooo much better and very easy!!)

This sauce is excellent!  The only change I made was to use half and half instead of cream, and added about three cloves of garlic.  As others have said, add the cheese gradually and keep on whisking.  Perfecto!  ***UPDATE: The sauce also reheats well the following day.  It will thicken greatly overnight, but add it to a saucepan with a bit of extra cream or milk, and heat gently.

Excellent taste. This recipe makes about 3-1/4 cups of sauce. I made this to use in place of the bottled stuff called for in the recipe for Crab Stuffed Manicotti.

This simple recipe tasted just that . . . bland and simple.  There wasn't anything to balance the parmesan cheese, and that is an overwhelming flavor when there's too much.

Gets 4 stars instead of 5 because it does not keep well AT ALL.  Wonderful taste, simple recipe, but if I have any left over I have to toss it.  Once refrigerated, the fats and solids separate, and there's just no fixing it.

Oh my GOD!!  The taste of this alfredo sauce is soooo rich and fabulous!  After trying it once, i couldn't help but thinking of it the next few days.  At second try, i let my boyfriend taste my cooking of this delicious alfredo sauce.  He soon fell in love and is hooked by it.  He kept asking me to cook it over and over again.  I've cooked it more than 10 times.  I love this sauce and it's so  easy to cook.  Try this, people.  With this sauce, don't even bother dining outside.  It can save your $$$ by cooking.  It's worth the effort.  Kudos to the creator of this recipe!!!

This was ok - I used butter instead of margarine and think that contributed to the blandness - added garlic, salt, pepper and a little parprika and can't quite put my finger on what I didn't like as far as the taste. We had this with blackened chicken and penne pasta. I would make it again but think I'll try margarine next time and adding some different spices. Makes a goodsized amount so is a nice recipe for those with 4-5 ppl to feed.

This is the only way to make a good alfredo. Sometimes I add 1/4 Cup pesto to my sauce. I aslo only use fresh parmasane and I grate it right before I put it in. This tatses so much better than the prepared stuff.

I made this for a multi family dinner.  It was a hit all around.  I took the suggestion of others by adding the cheese slowly letting it dissolve before adding more.  Very easy recipe.

This is my first review, when I saw that this had only 3 ingredients I was a tad skeptical but delighted with the outcome!  I tried the italian cheese blend and it rocked!  Just a small hint... when adding the cheese I didn't have the heat high enough at first so the cheese fell to the bottom, with small adjustments made (turning heat up a notch) cheese started melting and sauce was perfect!!!

A really great recipe. My girlfriend was impressed. Told it was the best alfredo sauce she has ever tasted. We both agreed thought that it needs about a 1/2 of tsp. of salt.
Also, the second time I cooked it, I added in minced fresh garlic...wonderful!!!

Yummmmmy! I took some advice from the other reviews and added garlic with the butter and used fresh parmesan and added it slowly making sure it melted before adding more. Turned out wonderfully. And I found that it reheats just fine in the microwave - it wasn't goopy at all.

This recipe is great, but it really knocks the socks off of guests with some REAL flavor:
mince 1 HEAD or 15 cloves garlic.
saute garlic in the butter for 10 minutes on the LOWEST setting.  Do not let the garlic brown.
Add thin sliced mushrooms, 1-2 cups.  sautee till cooked.
add the cream and parmesan as directed.
for some color, add 1-2 cups of fresh spinach, after cooking it down in another pan briefly.

If the sauce won't thicken, I add one tablespoon of corn starch mixed in a tablespoon or two of cold water to the finished sauce.

I think you guys are making it wrong or maybe you expect a typical alfredo sauce. The parmesan gives it a more Italian homestyle characteristic. I did find the sauce a little runny but nothing a little flour couldn't fix. I would say this recipe is easy but just a base and is made for seasoning to your liking.

i have just made this alfredo sauce and its thickining as i write this. it is wonderfull. i threw a lil garlic and some pepper in it and it is perfect over linguine. (i dipped some in to see)i put it over though rather than mix it all intogether. about a pound of pasta i think or so. i dont know its great so far and soooo easy!!!! love this one. i also used the in the can parmesan cheese and made sure that i mixed it really good and so far its working. i used an eight oz container of it because when i measured it out it was about a cup and a half.

If you purchase shredded parmesean instead of the powder type this sauce will not be grainy.  
Also try using a mixuture of Parm., Romano and Asiago.  I have done both with great success

I made the recipe for 2 servings only, and I added 2 tablespoons cream cheese. Needed a whisk to blend it all and make it smooth and creamy. I found the sauce to be a bit thicker than I liked, but very tasty. It needed salt and pepper, which I had added during cooking but found it needed more at the table. I would make this again but might use evaporated milk instead of whipping cream to make the sauce a bit thinner.

Delish! Heated the cream slowly then added small pieces of butter at a time. Then added the Parmesan cheese in batches & stirred constantly. I added some garlic powder then poured the sauce over penne (daughter’s favorite) & added broccoli that was steamed in chicken broth and some sliced boneless, skinless chicken that I grilled with salt, pepper, garlic powder & extra virgin olive oil. Can’t wait for my daughter to get home from work & have some!

Wonderful recipe and very versatile!  Added parsley, garlic powder and Lowry's Seasoned Pepper.  Made with shrimp sauteed in garlic butter.  Made the Alfredo sauce and then added the shrimp in garlic butter, then added drained noodles.  Yum!

I will never go to OG or buy jarred again.  Excellent.  The only things I did different are 1-heating the cream and slowly adding the butter in pieces until melted.  2-then slowly adding the cheese while constantly whisking.  3-I used shredded from a container (Bella Rosa-not Kraft fake stuff)  in the refrigerated section (only because I thought that is what it called for when I bought it).  4-added a little garlic and onion powder.  I went really low on the temp as my stove is messed up but when the different elements start melting you know you have the right temp.

I use the same ingredients to make my alfredo sauce, but with a few variations. I use an entire wedge of freshly ground parmesan. I also add garlic powder and onion powder (both seasoned to taste), & a couple dashes of nutmeg. 

I gave the recipe to my friend. Her family loved it! She started to use premade sometime later & her family complained! They want her to use my recipe from now on!!

5 stars for the ease of making and the few ingredients required. I am not a huge fan of alfredo but my husband is. I added a little minced garlic and a dash of nutmeg. I added coho salmon I caught as the protein and it was a wonderful combination!!!

Loved this SUPER easy alfredo sauce.  As others mentioned, I melted the butter first; added the cream,stirring until completely blended; then the cheese a handful at a time, stirring until melted.  I also added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning and fresh basil for flavor.  Amazing!

It was great!! (Altered)That said, I added 4oz of shaved Parmesan pieces, 2 fresh garlic cloves; pushed through a garlic press, 1 cup heavy whipping cream, salt and pepper to taste. 

I made chicken Florentine. I used this sauce, fresh steamed spinach and 4 sautéed chicken boneless breasts and a box of orrichiette pasta. Mmmuuhh! Tres’ magnifique!

Enjoy

The sauce did not thicken for me. I cooked it at medium heat, used the ingredients listed in the recipe, and let it sit off the stove for awhile. It was tasty, 'cos I added some minced garlic and black pepper. It just didn't turn out the way I expected.

Really good and REAL alfredo sauce. Finally one that doesn't use cream cheese making it lighter and better tasting! I added a little pepper, garlic powder and a pinch of nutmeg to it too.

This alfredo sauce is perfection.  It is easy to make and taste incredible.  Make sure you use grated parmesan cheese to ensure that the cheese melts easily.  

No need to buy premade alfredo sauce, this is easy to make and much better tasking.  Enjoy!

cook the cream slowly and i jazzed it up a bit added a few seasonings. 2 teaspoons of garlic powder 2 teaspoon chives 1 teaspoon tarragon 1/2 teaspoon of marjoram 1 teaspoon of parsley 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1/8 teaspoon of pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of basil grind and blend all spices in mortar and add to cream mixture at the beginning to give time for flavor release these are approximate measurements on spices because i usually just add until it looks and smells to my liking came out great.

This is the best Alfredo sauce and the easiest I ever made. Follow the tips. Especially add the fresh grated Parmesan cheese slowly. I serve it over spaghetti squash and sometimes add shrimp or chicken.

This was a last minute decision to make Alfredo sauce with some tri color fresh tortellini tonight.  I made half the recipe which was perfect for the amount of pasta.
I also added 1 tsp sea salt, 2 turns of black pepper from my grinder, 1 crushed dry garlic slice and 1/4 cup diced mozzarella.
I added the cream to partially melted butter and gradually added the cheese while stirring.  
The sauce was GREAT on the tortellini with 1/4 cup petite peas and 2 Tbsp crumbled bacon.
I will definitely make this again.

Melted the butter, added the cream and added cheese a little at a time continually whisking as suggested. Added pepper and garlic to taste. Turned out really well. Was a very easy recipe. Thanks.

I sauteed fresh garlic and broccoli in the butter and seasoned with salt and pepper.  You have to be patient while stirring and watching for thickening. I added sauteed shrimp for a delightful shrimp Alfredo.

Great base to start with. Can use as is or add to it. I found extra garlic brought out more flavor. Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. Worked just as well. Nice to have an alfrado without cream cheese. Will definitely make again.

Love this sauce! So simple and easy. My family and friends all rave about it.  I add some McCormick herb and garlic seasoning. I use packaged parmesan instead of fresh, but my family prefers it that way.

This is DEFINITELY a base. To start, I half sweated and half sauteed some onion. I was a little low on heavy cream, so I mixed a little lemon juice with a little sour cream to make up for the rest. 
This sauce *really* needs salt, so I also heated the above mixture separately and added chicken broth base to add a savory element. Then when adding the parmesan, I whisked in a little at a time to taste, rather than measuring. I also added pinches of crushed, dried basil, parsley, thyme, paprika, garlic powder, and even a touch of cayenne (not enough to make it spicy - just enough to cut the lemon a bit). Served it over capellini with chicken spiedini, and they complimented each other pretty darn well.

I layered some flavors to this. I sauteed chicken in basil oil, then sauteed mushrooms because I needed to use up. I added garlic seasoning to both with some pepper. Then when I added the butter I threw in some minced fresh garlic.I had to use parmesan from the container as it was all I had. This came out fantastic!! So easy. Like that it doesn't use cream cheese.

Excellent and easy!  So much better than the basic commercial chain restaurants like the Olive Garden.  Their food is processed, frozen and reheated.  It's certainly not made fresh so you can' t even compare!  This recipe is delicious!

By far the best basic Alfredo recipe. I added minced garlic, minced onions and a few seasonings. Made this as a side dish with pizza. And wow, the whole family was raving.

This is the most amazing and heavenly fettucine alfredo I have ever had and I'm picky. I've been using this recipe for the past four years. Better than every Italian restaurant I have ever eaten at and I made it myself! The trick is to mix in the fresh shredded parmesan cheese very slowly and stir as you're mixing. Make sure you cook your fettucine pasta properly and drain it well. I have it with shrimp or chicken, both are delicious.  Only drawback- it does not taste half as good the next day reheated. For some reason the consistency falls apart after being refrigerated and microwaved and it gets all oily. Prepare to serve this right after cooking!

I tried several times to make Alfredo using real Parmesan - like all the 'real' cooks said to do.  Every time my sauce gummed up and was basically unedible.  Hallelujah!  Now I tried this simple recipe and my sauce is perfect.  I didn't want to use the Parm in a can, but this is what WORKS!  The only change I made was to use half and half instead of cream because I always have half and half in the fridge.  So, if you have had difficulties making Alfredo before - just use this simple recipe for a perfect result.

I just made this sauce a few minutes ago.  I made some simple changes for what I had on hand.  *I used whole milk instead of heavy cream, shredded Italian blend cheese and chicken stock to thin it out somewhat..  It's a very basic but, very good sauce to learn how to make.  I had some cooked chicken and some spinach I added to round it out & make it an easy weeknight meal.  I've also added mushrooms, peas, onions.. Very good dish.

Let me start off by saying this is a SIMPLE cheese sauce. For what it is it's really good. However don't walk into this thinking I am going to make this for my spouse and really impress them. I will be making it again. it is a great way the use up whipping cream well having a meal the kids and I can enjoy. 

I did add garlic for more favor. I would remand before staring add garlic and olive oil on medium cook for about 2-3 minutes then doing as recipes says.

This is the exact recipe which was made tableside by a chef at a restaurant.  I cut up garlic and wipe the pan with the garlic before melting the butter, I also wipe the bowl or platter with garlic and put rest in sauce.  This is fantastic and beats out any other Alfredo sauce I have tasted.  Love to add sliced chicken breast or serve chicken breast alongside.

Used 1/2 lbs of fresh grated Parmesan.  Delicious.  Added crushed garlic, nutmeg, a pinch of curry, and chicken billion paste.  The result was a mild but rich sauce that my husband raved about!

Fresh parmesan is a must. Fast easy and delicious. I also added cooked chicken and about 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick. Tossed with penne cooked pasta and baked with grated mozz/cheddar cheese. Added a salad and garlic bread and was a killer dinner.

Excellent recipe.  As others did, I melted the butter first, adding some garlic to it, then added the cream, then the fresh-grated Parmesan.  Combined it with some sauteed chicken tenders and fettuccine....what good meal.

Fresh Parm, added slow, constant stir. Great simple white sauce.  If it is for meat eaters start with some bacon grease.

Ooohhh weee. Let me tell you! This sauce is so easy and so ding dang good. I threw some shrimp off in there and added some parsley flakes. Oh my goodness. My son - the one who's been here before - LIKED IT!!! He took it to school for lunch and the kids swore him up and down he was lying and that he had gotten it from Red Lobster.  It really was the BALM! It healed me from the bottle alfreado sauce -hahahaha.

Made as directed. Sautéed shrimp in butter and lots of garlic. Added a little salt and pepper and herbs of Provence to the Alfredo sauce. Shrimp over Zita pasta and Alfredo on top.  Fantastic !!  Will be doing this again !

To anyone who rated this anything else but 5 stars; I've cooked and managed many popular restaurants including The Olive Garden, TGI Fridays and Applebees to name a few. This is the exact way we made our Alfredo sauce, the trick is, as others have mentioned, is to keep the heat at medium as a friend minimum. Next is to add the FRESH Parmesan cheese last and no more than a 1/2 cup at a time! When you get ready to add the Parmesan cheese it is crucial that the sauce be hot, not a full boil hot, but a slow, consistent boil. Otherwise the cheese won't melt and incorporate into the sauce. Don't be afraid to play with the recipe to make it more to your liking, for instance, adding garlic from fresh crushed to garlic powder or salt. Fresh basil, oregano or parsley are other common add ons, but make sure you have the basic recipe down before you play with it.  Don't be frustrated or quit if it doesn't come out right the first time you make it, even professional chefs have to remake it occasionally, yes it's a simple recipe with only simple ingredients but it requires timing and technique.

Tip for more flavor: add a chicken boulliban to melted butter.  Been making this for year and my family loves it as a side with chicken cutlets. You can get creative and add (cooked chicken, broccoli, etc.). I'very given this receipt out a lot too. The less butter you use the better the reheat. Tends to be oily the next day but still tasty. I add garlic bread too.

I thought it was great! Basic alfredo sauce. Use the right ingredients and the right pasta and it tastes just right. I did add a touch of corn starch for my own personal taste on thickness.. was a hit with my picky eater!

This was the first time I successfully made an alfredo without it being a big ball of goop after a few minutes. I started by bringing all the ingredients to room temperature about 30 minutes before cooking. Not sure why, but I had read to do it for another sauce one time, so I thought why not?!   I melted the butter first, with two cloves of pressed garlic, because, well, garlic is yummy and smells divine when cooking! I kept the burner on between 2 and 4 and  added the pint of heavy cream. I stirred pretty much non stop for a while. I admit, I got a bit impatient because no bubbling was happening, so I turned it up to about 6, got some bubbles, returned it to 4 and started adding in the parm.  I grated the Parmesan and am wondering if the clumps may form because of different grating sizes.  I made my parm very small vs. the larger grate.  I added it slowly, with whisk in other hand. I stirred all in within about 3-5 minutes.  Kept stirring then moved to back burner. It was still somewhat runny but it did thicken a tad. I served it with shell pasta and some spicy jerk shrimp!  It was delicious!!

Not very good in my humble opinion.

Leave out all of the butter. 

Put 2 cloves of minced garlic in a hot skillet and then add the heavy whipping creme. Bring it to a slow boil and add your pre cooked fettuccine noddles. Then add fresh grated Parmesan cheese to get the thickness you prefer. Done! 

You can add some pesto if you want.

This is a wonderful base recipe to do what you want.  I cut down the butter slightly and added olive oil.  It seems to pull all of the flavors together with a nice Italian hint.  Terrific with a little basil and fresh shrimp.  To the person who used cheddar cheese instead of parmesan... I think you created a macaroni and cheese off shoot, certainly not Alfredo.

Very tasty, with the addition of a little chopped garlic with the butter. I must have done something wrong however; the sauce was grainy, as if the cheese hadn't dissolved, but I heated and whisked till it was almost boiling.

Made this slowly as suggested; but to truly elevate this sauce, I pureed roasted garlic and added it in after I took it off the heat. Favorite combo with this sauce is shrimp, asparagus, and mushrooms.

It was super easy to make. I doubled the recipe, added fresh mushrooms, salmon, fresh spinach and mixed in penne rigate. I put shredded mozzarella on top & baked about a half an hour. Delicious.

Nice and easy, and a great introduction to homemade Alfredo sauce for me! It's my first try, and I'm fairly pleased. I ended up using some pre-packaged, shredded parmesan and adding a dash of garlic power. It turned out well, but needed frequent stirring to get smooth.

Made this tonight for the first time. DH liked it, roommate loved it. I had problems with it, but that is probably because I didnt measure anything, and I have no idea if the butter I used was unsalted. I did use fresh grated parmesan. I sauteed garlic and mushrooms in the butter, then added the heavy cream and 1/2 pint of half and half, then added the cheese a handful at a time. The butter rose to the top and separated. I don't know what I did, or didnt do, to have that happen, but that was a major issue for me. I ended up pouring out quite a bit of butter off of the top. Next time I'll measure like I should have done in the first place, and I'll make sure to use unsalted butter. Overall, it was a success and I will make it again, just better next time. Thanks for the recipe!

The sauce is as everyone said. I melted the butter added three minced garlic cloves to the melted butter. I will add more garlic next time. Garlic makes the biggest difference. Then I added the cream and then the cheese. I added shrimp to ours. The sauce isn't thick enough just coming off the stove. So I am Letting it sit awhile. I also doubled the sauce. I have poured half over our pasta and left the remaining sauce to add to the top if needed. So far looking at the pasta with the sauce on it and stirring it every few minutes it appears to have plenty of sauce. If not I have extra sauce. My 10 year old thinks its great.

I loved this Alfredo sauce, the only ingredient I added was fresh crushed garlic one large clove to the butter as it was melting, I do agree with Chefsingledad that it is important to use FRESH  PARMESAN that you grate or the kind that is sold in the deli's freshly grated and are kept refrigerated with an expiration date one must look at. It is a awesome sauce Thank You Kathy Rose for sharing this simple but elegant recipe !

These are the only ingredients needed. Perfect. Taste 1000 times better than the stuff made with flour. If the texture doesn't seem right try melting the butter over low heat and alternately adding cheese and cream till cheese is melted.

I have to agree with the Chefsingledad and also Speedycivicgirl.  You need to add the cheese SLOWLY.  I never use fresh parmesan.  It's to expensive.  Melt the butter first.  Then add the cream and whisk and keep mixing it because if you let it sit, it'll separate.  Then add the cheese a little bit at a time waiting about 2-3 min between adding each bit.  You need to make sure you have the heat set to medium, NOT medium low and keep whisking briskly.  Then last but not least...add whatever spices you want.  I like parsley and oregano.  then VIOLA! Perfect alfredo sauce.  

This is one of the BEST alfredo sauces I have made.  Love it! Oh and I use 5% cream or half and half cream.  Don't forget that.  :)

I make often, basically the same recipe.  But for all you 4 stars and less, try this.  I followed this recipe with a few additions.  I had some Italian sausage that I cooked up with onions.   I added a cut up grilled chicken breast and zucinni that I boiled with the pasta.  The secret is....add a dash of nutmeg to the sauce.  It is delicious!

I was skeptical of the recipe since I didn't know if the butter would integrate with the cream.  It did and made for a luscious sauce.  I added chopped garlic in with the butter when it was melting.  I added the parmesan cheese in stages until it fully melted and stirred with a whisk often.  I added in salt and pepper and it made for a wonderful dinner.  Hubby said we could have this once a month since it was that good.

this is a great, easy recipe. I did have a hard time getting it to thicken as the recipe says it will. I added a cornstarch slurry and then it thickened nicely. It tastes really good though, maybe I'll read some of the reviews and try to do it right next time.

Best sauce ever... I doubled the recipe, added shrimp and mushrooms that were sauted in butter and garlic powder. Then I added a package of cooked fettucine noodles. It came out perfect, and even better the next day. I love this recipe and will continue to use it over and over again. Just note though, that it is a little runny at first, but comes out perfect once the pasta is added to it. Don't know if it thickens as it sits. I didn't try that.

I added a small can of mushrooms while still cooking the sauce and at the end leftover steak -- just in there long enough to heat it. It was amazing. I felt like I was eating out in my living room. Something this easy shouldn't taste so good! I will definitely be making this again!

Very easy and quick to put together.  I added minced onion & onion powder (I was in a hurry) and some minced garlic in a jar I keep in the refrigerator.  I used shredded parmesan from the dairy section.  Only comment negatively is the parmesan was stringy during stirring and when serving.  Maybe a flour sauce with the butter would help?  Might try next time and review again.

This is how I learned to make alfredo sauce...It's so simple to make, and tastes wonderful. I remember when I first learned to make this, and thinking to myself...this is all thet's in there, lol, but yes, it's that easy! :)

Just made this tonight, my boyfriend and I thought it was delicious. I added chicken and steamed broccoli. My grocery store didn't have heavy cream so I had to use just regular whipping cream. I used 5 oz of shredded parmesan and added a tsp of garlic powder and a sprinkling of garlic salt. I was pleased how it came out. I think store bought sauce is kind of gross. My boyfriend had 2 bowls!

Oh... I also used whole wheat noodles :)

I absolutely love this sauce! It's perfect! And well worth getting fresh parmesan cheese. DO NOT, WHATEVER YOU DO, GET THE PRE-GRATED "fresh" IN A BAG CHEESE!!!! It won't melt. Get a wedge, grate it yourself, and you won't have problems. I've made this for Valentine's Day, my fiancee's birthday, and I'm making it again tonight, it's fantastic with steak (and sauteed mushrooms, YUM!!!) or shrimp as well as chicken!

This makes a good base for alfredo sauce.  I added garlic salt and pepper to mine and it was really tasty.  I used Mimicreme instead of cream because I am loctose intolerant.  Hopefully I can tolerate the parmesan cheese, which by the way didn't melt but it was not fresh parmesan.  I will try fresh parmesan next time.

Delicious.  I can't stand storebought alfredo sauce so I was very happy to find this recipe.  I used freshly grated parmesan and definitely love my garlic so I added garlic powder and threw in some fresh chopped basil leaves.  yumm!

Although I followed the directions exactly this never setup for me. Even after cooling down completely it was still thin. Good flavor, bad consistency. Not sure what went wrong.

I gave this a 5 star  it was really easy for me to make and I'm not a cook.  I didn't put all the parmesan in for I'm not a large fan of it and added a little bit of garlic powder and black pepper. And it came out really good.  will use this again.

I was about to give up ever making Alfredo sauce but this was so easy, so quick and it tasted wonderful. I'm now eating Fettucini Alfrdo more often than the diet allows. Sometime I add shrimp or crab, chicken & broccoli. I love all the recipes I've found on Allrecipes. Next I'm going to try Cheese Souffle!

I followed this recipe twice and then kind of eyeballed it every time I've made it afterwards, which has been a lot of times.  It's a great start and then you add what you want!  I always make sure I throw in some garlic, oregano, and crushed red pepper.

This sauce was amazing! This was the first recipe for alfredo I came across and so glad I did! Forget using the jarred stuff. The only change I made was using shredded parmesan instead of grated.

DELICIOUS!!!! A snap to make. I used to make alfredo sauce out of cream cheese, but not after I tried this. I added a bit of garlic pepper and oregano, and it turned out perfect. My son asked for seconds! He rarely ever does that!

It was alright. Needed more flour and way to much Parmesan cheese.

I should have let it cook a little longer cause it was a little grainy.  My husband takes credit for the idea, but I know where the recipe came from:)

i found this was a great base - i personally like to add extra seasoning / stuff (ie mushrooms, garlic etc) to my sauce - but as is... it's pretty yummy :)  I'll use this again for sure.

I think I might be missing something...sometimes I make this and its wonderful! Other times (which is unfortunately, more often than not), it just doesn't want to bind together and I find I have to constantly stir it to keep it blended! T-T

So easy and delicious! I ended up using 6 tbsps of butter instead of 8 (8 tbsps = 1/2 cup), since I didn't feel like using a whole stick, and it still turned out wonderful!

Very good, simple recipe that took little to no time to prepare at all.  I made some substitutions for a lighter version though.  Instead of heavy cream I used light and instead of butter I used light margarine.  Both worked just fine.  I used grated parmesan (regular) and that was all this recipe needed.  To my taste, I added a little bit of black pepper to the sauce once it was complete.  I served this with crab meat and whole wheat pasta.  It reminded me of the crab alfredo dish at Red Lobster, yum!  The sauce was great, and I would definitely make it again.

I used Smart Balance instead of real butter, reduced the whipping cream and it turned out very yummy.   If your cheese happens to turn into one big blob, like mine did...just leave it on med-low heat for 5 minutes and it will melt and blend out.

This sauce was AMAZING!  I followed the advice of the last two reviewers and it was fabulous!  Very rich so make sure not to drench your pasta in it, but the sauce was great!  I will definitely be making this again...and again!

As a trained Chef I must say...Very good, very easy.  added a couple teaspoons of minced garlic for flavor.  I also added about another 1/2 cup of cheese because I like a strong cheese flavor.  This would also be good with romano or asiago cheese as well.  Goes great with blackened chicken and farfalle (which is what I made tonight).  My family devoured it!

This sauce is delicious- I recommend adding a clove or two of crushed garlic. Also, make sure you use it up right away, I found that it didn't heat up very well, but all in all, a tasty and easy recipe.

This recipe was very easy. I ended up using the pre-grated parmesan cheese (its all i had on hand) and it didn't quite melt to perfect smoothness. I do believe it would if I had use fresh paremesan. It tasted wonderful just as is, but I added garlic powder to mine and it was great that way too!

This was a really good recipe! Following other reviews, I did the following:  warmed the whipping cream to almost a simmer, then added the butter in tablespoon-cut pieces. Then, I added a blend of packaged shredded cheese that was parmesan, romano and asiago - 1-2/3 cups. I used a whisk and added just a little cheese at a time, whisking the whole time. After the cheese was melted and the sauce was smooth, I added about a clove of finely chopped garlic and a couple of teaspoons of Italian seasoning. The consistency was fine to me - a little thicker than standard tomato sauce. I served it over spaghetti squash, and it was wonderful! Thanks for sharing your recipe Kathy!

This alfredo sauce was really good! However, I didn't have any whipping cream, so I used a couple splashes of milk and a couple tablespoons of cream of chicken soup because I was making a turkey carbonara with it. Came out DELICIOUS with NO leftovers!

Made this today for a casserole.  Substituted 1/2 Asiago for 1/2 of the Parm.  Added minced garlic to the butter before adding the cream and cheese.  Added a dash of nutmeg and some italian herbs.  Mixed in some cheese tortellini and smoked turkey.  Topped it off with a little Mozzerela and baked for about 30 min.  Yummy!

Kathy Rose, I tried your recipe tonight, and was so impressed with it; I had to create an account to comment on this outstanding recipe.  I did add sea salt, ground pepper, minced garlic and used packaged shredded parmesan cheese.  My husband and I both agreed ... We will NEVER use jarred sauce again.

I did a pretty good job on this...... I added 2 tsp.butter, a handful of parmesan cheese, half cup milk, and 2 shakes of powdered ginger. It was awesome! My sisters LOVED it, but my parents would touch it because of thier expierence with my past cooking. Awesome recipe!

Flavor is fantastic but sauce is too thin even after letting cool for 30 minutes.

I make this often, I add worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, adobo, 8oz can of mushroom and a little milk let it simmer for about 5-8mins.  Had it with pasta and ground beef and it was allsome. , my family loves it.

When I get home from work and am too tired to make anything super involved I turn to this alfredo sauce.  In 15 minutes I can cook some noodles and saute some veggies and have a delicious dinner.  My only suggestion is to make sure to add the cheese slowly.  I spaced once while I was making this and dumped the cheese in all at once and it ended up a bit clumpy.

I like this recipe because it's basic and you can add to it. But my rule for alfredo has always been keep it equal = equal parts butter, cream, and cheese, and that has worked for me for years. The cheese is def. to taste, but equal parts cream and butter seems to yield the consistency I like. I also added an egg yolk. Served over buitoni muhroom ravioli. DELISH!!!

Excellent!!  I used fresh parmesan, and real butter.  I followed directions exactly only adding a touch of garlic salt for flavor.  Very rich and creamy.

A lil too liquidy and a lil to bold of flavor for me...might try again just to see if I did something wrong.  But, it isn't my first time making homemade alfredo sauce. I usually use a betty crocker recipe.

This is a very simple to make alfredo sauce.  It's probably not the best out there, but for the busy cook, it's great.  I did add some pepper and sauteed spinach and served over cooked chicken.  It made a great meal (with a side of pasta) but please note:  This does not save well.  The butter and cream will separate on leftovers, so you'll need to make just enough for one meal.

Very easy and good.  Un used portion used again later on any noodles.  Kid favorite.  I splurged and got expensive fresh ground parmesian.  Dont know if it made a difference, but it was eaten up fast!

Just made this sauce tonight to go with salmon and it was a big hit with my kids. I took advise from some reviews and added 1 tsp of minced garlic and pepper to taste. I found it was a bit runny and not as smooth. I would suggest to very slowly add parmesan and fresh might work best (I used grated). I will never buy store bought again!! Yummy!!

I made this according to the directions, cream, freshly grated Parmesan, and all. Added slowly over medium heat while whisking. It thickened in about twenty minutes and became grainy. What am I doing?? It still tasted great, but I would not serve it to company because of the texture. For a while it was not grainy, but it was also too thin to serve. So confused.

made this last night at the suggestion of a co-worker and was going to post it. The only difference is I used 2 sticks of butter(can never have too much butter), and added pepper. The sauce was so yummy and super easy! we drenched grilled chicken breasts, fettucine, and steamed broccoli and cauliflower with it for a 30 minute meal that was fabulous!

I REALLY LOVED THIS. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THE CHEESE WOULD NOT MELT. AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES IT STILL HADENT MELTED. I DID WHAT THE USERS SAID AND HEATED UP THE MILK AND BUTTER AND SLOWLY ADDED THE CHEESE. MABYE IT WILL DO BETTER NEXT TIME.

Really good.  I wanted to use a white sauce to make my daughter a white cheese pizza.  She loved it!  It is runny because it's intended for noodles.  I added about a 1/2 handful of mozzarella and a teaspoon of cornstartch to thicken a little.

Outstanding!  I just added some garlic powder and it was so yummy.  This will be a special treat from time to time.  I agree with the others that it's just as good as Olive Garden's sauce!

Anyone who doesn't like this recipe... Doesn't like Alfredo sauce! Seasoned to taste this is as good as Alfredo sauce gets. I add a little garlic and pepper and my family can't get enough. I do think it's important to melt the butter first on med-high heat and introduce cream next, then add cheese slowly while stirring constantly. We like it with Angel Hair pasta also. Fantastico!

i made this sauce tonight for dinner and my husband and i loved it.  i agree with other members that it is as good as the olive garden.  i followed some tips that included adding a crushed clove of garlic to the butter and adding the parmesan cheese a little at a time.  i will be making this alfredo sauce from now on.  thank you so much.

I don't use a lot of dairy products, so I substituted the butter for vegan butter and used soy milk. I did, however, use the parmesan cheese and my friends love it.

I do not think I will ever buy a jar of alfredo sauce again.  Thnis was way better than any one I have had.  Super easy too!  I glanced at the recipe in the afternoon and pretty much did it from memory.  The key is to slowly add the cheese while wisking it in!  Thank you All Recipes.com this was very helpful

It was very tasty, but I couldn't get it to thicken.  If I let it cool it got thick, but as soon as I heated it up, it was liquid.

This sauce was so good!  So much tastier than jarred sauce.  It did start to break down quickly after it began to cool on our plates,...and it does not reheat well.  Even so, we will not be going back to jar alfredo sauce.

Very easy! We did add 1 clove minced garlic and a pinch of nutmeg. I let the sauce "stand" for a minute to thicken and then put it back on the heat, but when we started eating I discovered it was just lukewarm. I recommend really working the heat back into it before serving.

This was very yummy!  I added some of my own touches though: added shredded bbq chicken from a leftover whole chicken cooked in slow cooker.  Also added fresh ground pepper and garlic powder to taste.  Had to add more cream to tone down the garlic though so will remember that for next time.

Absolutely wonderful!  Tastes great cooked exactly like the recipe and is easily tweaked to compliment different foods.  Some of our favorite additions are pepper and a little fresh crushed garlic.

This is an outstanding alfredo sauce.  I added just a pinch of garlic powder.  I also topped with sauteed mushrooms and black pepper.  My wife, the pickiest eater ever, even loved it.

This is the BEST alfredo sauce! My husband (who is a very picky eater) raves about this recipe!! 

I add a little minced garlic and a pinch of italian seasoning, and it is a MUST to use fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Sometimes if the sauce is to runny I may add a small amount of flour just to thicken it up a little.

I love alfredo and this is the easiest recipe I have found. I did have one from an authentic italian cook but this one is much better. However i did half and half instead of heavy whipping cream and added a splash of cooking cherry and some garlic. Also added crab and shrimp to it. Kids and husband love it. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is so good and easy.  I don't know why other people had issues with this!  I did add some garlic as suggested by other reviews and I loved it.  I followed the directions exactly and had no problems.  I will use this recipe from now on when I want alfredo sauce!

Delicious! My boyfriend loves alfredo sauce and this was so simple to make. I used regular grated parmesan cheese so it was not throughly smooth and had a rustic feel to it, and threw in a teaspoon or so of italian seasoning. Topped it with chicken and my boyfriend said I spoil him... haha.

This was really good sauce. We had our neighbors over and at the last minute I decided to make dinner. This went so quickly and tasted delicious. I was a bit nervous because I put all the ingredients in together per the directions and then read other reviewer suggestions of putting it in a bit at a time. Not a problem. I had microplaned the cheese so it melted easily. Use Fresh... I also added a dash of garlic powder and onion at the last minute. Oh. I ended up using half whipping cream and half "half and half" because it was all that was in the fridge. Still Great!

This recipe is fabulous!!  It was so easy.  I did not have parmesean cheese and used sliced monteray Jack and Provolone.  I added a little pepper as well.  It turned out much better than expected.  Very fast and delicious.  I will definately make this recipe when I have company over.

Tasty....my husband and I both gave it a 4.  I followed a reveiwers recommendation to add small amts of butter and cheese at a time...it was very smoothe, but even after setting it aside to thicken, it didn't get thick, so I mixed 2 tsp of cornstarch in a little cool water and added it to the hot sauce (some experience chef reading this will probably shutter at that thought....but it worked for me)  Though I thought it was delicious, I had a hard time getting past the calories/fat, but I guess that is what you get with alfredo sauce.....I should read other reviews and see if anyone tried some lower fat substitutions.

Mine didn't turn out quite as smooth as I wanted, but the cheese wasn't exactly ultrafresh...it was a little grainy.  I added a little garlic oil as I melted the butter. I also didn't have whipping cream, so I used a combination of half-and-half, and milk thickened up with powdered milk.  I think it came out wonderfully considering all of my weird substitutions, and my whole family thought the flavor was great.  Excellent, simple recipe.

I didn't even have the correct ingredients and this was awesome!  I was needing a quick dinner tonight and happened to think "alfredo".  This was super easy and worked pretty well with skim milk (no cream at home).  I did add garlic as the reviews suggested.  Superb.  I can't wait to try it with cream.  It should be delicious.

We have been using this recipe for about 8 years now- and it is a great basic alfredo sauce. To help keep a smooth texture I have found it best to use fresh parmesan and not the grated kind in a jar. Also, if you had it slowly to the cream it will melt as you stir it in and help keep the texture smooth. We alos make sure we melt it on a low tempature in order to avoid scalding or over cooking it (which will also make it lumpy). FInally- go nuts with seasonings - make it different! Sometimes we add Cajun seasoning to make more of a creole alfredo, sometimes we use heavy garlic - tweak it to whatever you want the dish to be- this is a great base- make it yous!

This was my first time making an alfredo sauce and it turned out wonderful! I used fresh parmesan and added it very slowly, while stirring constantly. The cheese didn't completely melt (I "grated" it with my food processor, so maybe thats why) but it gave it a very nice texture, in my opinion. Excellent, easy, and quick recipe!

OMG!  This was so good - my kids gobbled it up which is a feat!  I added bacon, peas and fresh sliced mushrooms to make a carbonara over spinach fettucine. Might try adding garlic next time - I'm up for experimenting with this recipe, it's so easy.

VERY YUMMY! It didn't thicken very much, but that was my fault...After I poured the pint of heavy cream and stick of butter into the pot...I grated some Locatelli cheese and realized that I did not have 1 1/2 cups...I only had ONE cup!  DUH ME!!!!  I took the advice of other posters and added garlic powder and a little fresh ground pepper and sea salt.  It was DELISH!  I will definitely make it right next time!!!!  I poured it over penne pasta and broccoli...ya know, to give it a healthy twist!  LOL!  YUM!

This was an AWESOME recipe. I added 3 cloves of garlic that I grated and added a dash of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. This was absolutely amazing and tasted just like Olive Gardens!

This is the most awesome! Depending on what I am making I may vary it a little. Sometimes I add a bit of garlic powder or even 1 Tbsp of fresh squeezed lemon juice. But no matter what I do...I have learned that you must start with this recipe as a base and it will come out as wonderful as any fine Italian Restaurant. Thanks!

SO GOOD! This is a great base recipe as you can add any seasoning you like. I added fresh ground pepper and nutmeg, and grated garlic, and it tasted just like the garlic cream sauce at California Pizza Kitchen. Great job on this one! I will make again!

SO good!  I used fresh parm cheese and put it in very slow as suggested and it was so flavorful.  I also sprinkled in some onion powder, garlic powder AND some small cooked shrimp!  It was amazing.  I will make it many more times to come!

This was a very easy sauce. Creamy and smooth and did not clump at all! My 17 year old son is an Alfredo addict and he had two large servings, so I know he very much approved. I will make this again.

Great basic sauce. I added 1 cloves of garlic, parsley and a couple of chopped green onion (white part only) to the butter before adding the cream and cheese. I topped the pasta with grilled chicken and sundried tomatoes. Wonderful, quick and easy Sunday dinner.

I was always afraid to try to make alfredo but this is a snap.If you use fresh grated romano, it comes out exactly like the alfredo at Olive Garden. So easy and so good! Thanks for the recipe.

SO SO SO Good! and easy! I used on roasted veggies (brocoli, cauliflower, baby carrots, red onion and garlic) All I added was some roasted garlic and pinches of various freshly ground dried herbs/spices (rosemary, basil, sage, crushed red pepper...etc)
Delicious! Thanks a bunch!

Made this for the first time tonight. It wasn't thickening enough, so I added a little cornstarch. It seemed to do the trick. This is a great base recipe. I wasn't able to use freshly grated parm. I added garlic powder and pepper to taste. Also a little chili powder, and paprika, just enough to give the tiniest hint of a bite. I loved this with what I added, but my husband did not like the grainy texture. It was probably because I didn't use fresh parm, but it was grainy. Luckily it reminded me of OG's alfredo dipping sauce, which is to die for. Definitely delicious and EASY

Very simple. If you add crab meat with shrimp, its to die for. Dinner in minutes. Also, use fresh parm and garlic when possible along with garlic.
-cook the lump crab meat in the sauce
-sauté some shrimp in fresh garlic and butter and a couple shots of your fav hot sauce. top your parm alfredo pasta with it for a delicious bite.

My son really enjoyed this. My cheese was a little grainy, but I think that if I used fresh grated it would be much better. I also added a little garlic. Kids actually asked for it again already!

Recipe was great. I mixed it with garlic and shrimp; however, it was a little thin for my taste, and as some reviewers suggestes i added flour, that made it chunky, and some of the bumps never smoothened. Otherwise delicious.

I love alfredo sauce and I like this recipe for its simplicity and proportions.  I used margarine and I did not find it to be too salty.  I actually added a half tsp of garlic salt before tossing with the pasta.

EXCELLENT recpie and soooo easy.  When it was done, it was not quite as thick as I wanted.  So, I added a tablespoon of cornstarch and brought it to a quick boil to thicken it up a bit (depends on your preference).  I will make this over and over and over....  Yummm!

This sauce was really good. I didn't have fresh parm. cheese (only the Kraft stuff) and it still turned out great. I added garlic, pepper and parsley and even my very picky husband had seconds. I would definately make this again!

I found the texture of this sauce to be a little lumpy - due to my own ineptitude, I'm sure. I added the parmesan too much at a time. One of the reviews suggested adding only 1/2 cup at a time, a suggestion I will definitely take next time. Texture aside, the flavor was very much to my liking. I served it over tortellini and the children were practically licking their bowls!

This was ok. I put garlic,pepper and a dash of nutmeg and it still was missing something. I don't know what. My husband didn't like this one.

I had a hard time with my cheese not dissolving.  I think that when I grated the parmesan in my food processor that I didn't grate it fine enough.  Trust me, everyone, do not EVER buy the grated stuff in the green can, it is sawdust compared to real parmesan!  The parmesan was maybe too chunky to melt in 15 minutes.  I used butter and found the dish to be slightly greasy.  Again, this might be because the cheese didn't completely melt.  The flavor was a little bland. I added some salt, garlic powder, and pepper and still found it to be bland.  However, it was much better reheated in the microwave the next day.  I will definately be making this again, just with a few adjustments!!

This was Awesome - like a restaurant alfredo sauce!  Instead of using grated, I used freshly shredded parm. cheese and added garlic salt and powder!!  My husband wants me to make it all the time!!! Also very cheap to make!

This is an easy sauce and it's so simple.  Doesn't require that much attention either.

This was really good.  I added the cheese all at once and used store-bought pre-shredded parm cheese, so I'm sure thats why my cheese didn't fully melt (plus I'm impatient, which didn't help).  Nevertheless, even though it didn't melt well, it still tasted really good 7 is a great base recipe.  I'm going to try it again using freshly shredded parm (and possibly asigo/romano) and add it slowly to the cream.

This is great!!!  I used store bought parmesan cheese and it worked fine, very creamy.  I did add parsley flakes for color and added garlic salt.  We all loved it.  Thanks!

This is a great base for an alfredo sauce but in order for it to be complete, you need to add garlic powder (which helps keep the creamy consistency better than fresh), white pepper, and about five drops of tabasco sauce.  Yum.

This is an excellent recipe, my two year-old LOVES this. I've made it with shrimp and broccoli and chicken and broccoli. The store bought alfredo in a jar doesn't even compare. This is loaded with calories and fat, but it's well worth the splurge every once and a while. No problems with it getting thick enough either. One last tip, use fresh grated parmesan not the pre-packaged shredded stuff. I had trouble the second time I made this with getting the cheese to melt smoothly when I used the store shredded cheese.

Not bad, but it tasted too much like cream cheese.  I'll try a different alfredo recipe next time.

I was looking for a quick and easy alfredo sauce and this one fits the bill.  I halved the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  This is a tasty sauce, not the best alfredo I've ever had (I LOVE alfredo and am pretty picky), but still good.  I would probably make use this recipe again, maybe just adding some more parmesan cheese.  Thanks!

nice easy and filling but you should watch the amount of parmesan as the taste can be a bit overbearing. Gonna try it with mushrooms soon :)

Very Easy!  However, I also had some trouble getting the parmesan to melt ... so I heated it in the microwave.  That seemed to help.

I know this is probably true for most alfredo sauces.. but i hate when they get stiff after they start to cool off.

Kathy, you are the only person who has submitted a truly awesome Italian style alfredo sauce. This is just like my grandma's. So easy.  Don't buy a store bought sauce when you can make a perfect, slightly grainy (it's supposed to be) sauce at home. I've tossed mine with capelini pasta served with broiled swordfish a salad and chardonnay. Thanks Kathy.
