I love anything cream cheesy and thought that the tuna combination looked interesting.  It did not disappoint.  I made it for Mother's Day brunch and both my mom and I LOVED it.  I changed nothing in the recipe.  However, I didn't use it all in the two omelets so I had leftover filling and it was delicious with crackers the next day.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I liked the flavor of the tuna mixture. I did add salt and pepper to both the eggs and the tuna. I do think the filling  needed some texture so next time I'll add some spinach or something to it

This was a simple and fun omelet to make. I substituted sour cream for greek yogurt and it was just as good.

This was really good! As long as you drain the tuna really well the tuna does not overwhelm the flavour. I just added an extra teaspoon of dill, which makes the dish. Next time I will use fresh dill from the garden.

Well this is unique, and the flavor is pretty good, although the tuna overwhelmed the eggs.  I used Egg Beaters, which I find easier to make into omelets than regular eggs.  My husband and son wouldn't touch it, so it's not one I'll make again, but it's fun to try new things!

I made these into individual muffin cups and baked them and froze for a quick lunch on the go! I usually change,or add ingredients in order to suit my tastes,or use ingredients I have on hand. I didn't use vegetable oil,but used cold pressed avacado oil,( 1 teaspoon)as it is a healthy oil compared to the unhealthy hydrogenated vegetable oil.I sprayed the muffin pan with coconut oil spray from Trader Joes. Ketogenic friendly if you are eating that way like I am. :D

I was wary of the combination of ingredients but to my amazement it was quite tasty. Rich not a light omelet.

A very good alternative for tuna! I used coconut oil and subbed plain yogurt for the sour cream because thats what i had on hand. There was plenty of oil left in the pan after cooking the onions so i did not need the 2nd 2 TBS of oil. Otherwise no changes.  We had about a half cup of filling left over after filling the omlet, so will use that as a cracker spread as another reviewer recommended.
