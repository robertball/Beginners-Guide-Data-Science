This salad has a very light citrus-based poppy seed dressing; it's also VERY light in calories, carbs and fat (and that's a wonderful thing!)  Have always enjoyed arugula and watercress together, and I really liked the addition of the sweet fresh strawberries.  The addition of grilled shrimp would turn this into a fantastic summer main course salad.  Will be making this one again.
