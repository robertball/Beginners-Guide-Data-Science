This was good for a quick weeknight dessert on a very hot evening. I used raspberry sherbert, as that is what I had in the freezer and it tasted fine. I don't believe it matters much what flavor sherbert is used.  Any would be ok because I didn't detect it that much at all. This was really close to plain jell-o in taste and consistancy.
