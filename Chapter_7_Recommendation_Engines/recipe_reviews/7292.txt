This cake was really quick. I have to confess, I needed a dessert in a hurry so I used a boxed Confetti cake mix. I toasted the walnuts and didn't mix the pie filling in All the way, made it swirly. Nice way to be creative Janice!! Thank You Cherry Much! MMMM

man, that is one ugly cake!  but very, very easy.  i recently received a head injury, and, among other skills, lost my ability to follow recipes. but i followed this recipe perfectly.  it was so ugly, i thought i screwed it up.  but it was delicious!  i feel confident in trying other recipes.

This is an easy and super delicious cake!  I confess that I did not "dump," but used a mixing bowl to thoroughly, but quickly blend the ingredients.  Just a note of caution--be sure to blend the baking soda into the flour before mixing all the ingredients.  If the baking soda is not blended evenly there will be bitter spots in the cake.  My cake was done perfectly in 35 minutes.  A total of 45 minutes baking time seems a bit long and this may be the reason some of the other reviewers found the cake to be dry.  One final note--I added a few chocolate chips along with the nuts and this added a lot of interest and flavor to the cake.

After reading the reviews, I sifted the dry ingredients and mixed in the baking pan with the nuts.  I combined all the wet ingredients (I used 1/3 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup oil and also added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract) thoroughly and then added to the dry ingredients / nuts in the pan.  I thought I had stirred it pretty well, but there were still a few spots of dry flour.  Next time, I will dump it all in a bowl and stir it up with a spoon there before putting it in the pan.  I will also increase the almond extract to 1 teaspoon and add some cinnamon.

I did like the recipe because it was one of the few dump cakes that did not call for a cake mix (which I rarely keep on hand).

This is the easiest most excellent cake!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out moist and sweet... I think nearly any pie filling would work, so use your favorite.

I don't know what your other reviewer did wrong, as I found this easy to make and delicious to eat.  I was very pleased with it and am delighted with the way it has turned out.

By the way, the review "cards" look like pieces of toast!!

This was so easy and very yummy. My family all asked for seconds, which is saying something!  I left the walnuts out of the batter and sprinkled on top of half of the cake because we have some picky eaters.

what a great recipe! i must apologize, tho, as i didn't have the cherry pie filling. i used a jar of sour cherries. drained them and added about 4 T of the juice. i make an icing with the juice by adding a bit to some powdered sugar.

This is a very good and easy cake!  I have a house full of teenage boys running around all the time and they gobble it up as fast as I can make them.  We don't put topping or frosting on it, it's really good just by itself.  Easy to make flavor changes too by adding different spices and flavorings.  Others mentions using other pie fillings, I tried apple and didn't care for it personally but the boys went through it in a hurry.
Give this recipe a try, you won't be sorry!

I was frankly dissapointed in this cake.  It tasted rather oily, for lack of a better term.  I did follow the recipe as written.  I think the recipe is salvagable and will try it again with some substitutions.

I made this cake for the first time today for a fundraiser at church. Every piece of cake was sold. After reading other reviews, I substituted 1/3 cup of oil and 1/3 cup applesauce. I also added 1 teaspoon of almond extract. I baked the cake for 30-32 minutes. It was delicious. I will be making this cake again soon. Thanks Janice!

This was one of the driest and most "condensed" cakes I have ever made- it was the equivalent of a gluten-free cake but without any flavor.  The cherries and the nuts were overwhelmed by the density of the cake- I would never recommend this to anyone.
