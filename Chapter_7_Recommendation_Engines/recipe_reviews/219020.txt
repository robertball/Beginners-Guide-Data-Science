Wow! I made this chili for a chili feed and it turned out great! I tweaked it a little bit but the flavor was amazing! Definitely will be making it again, and recommend to others. It was judged 4th out of 30 different recipes!

This recipe is really good! I wanted to respond to JanKrzyz whom reviewed this chili that that's great you love the chili recipe! Though, if it's really good like you say you should give it at least 4 stars or 5 stars, because browsing recipe-seekers will see that you only gave it one star and think the recipe is terrible (since you're the only reviewer so far). Just wanted to help you!

After hearing friends talk about a local chili that has sauerkraut in it and how good it was, I decided to make my own version. My girlfriend and I put this recipe together on a Sunday afternoon and it turned out better than expected.  I can usually buy bulk beer brat sausage from a local grocery but they were out.  So we got the links, removed the casings and broke them up real fine while browning instead of cutting into pieces.  Going to enter this recipe in a chili cookoff in a couple weeks.  We hope everyone enjoys it as much as we did.

This is a excellant chili recipe. Very good flavor. Made for a chili feed and can't wait to see what the other campers think about this chili.  Will be making this many more time.

I found this chili to have way to much tomato taste, not enough of the other flavors. I wll try it again, but will probably cut out the tomato sauce totally, I will also reduce the salt. The only change I made in the recipe was to use rotel tomatoes instead of fresh jalapeno, didn't have any. I was also out of paprika and only used 1 oz of chocolate. I dont' think those changes made a big deal.

This turned out really well.  I entered it in a small chili contest and won 2nd place!  I followed directions exactly as stated.

I took the advice of another reviewer and left out the tomato sauce and this recipe still turned out to be so salty and acidic that we could hardly eat it.  I was so disappointed!  I never get heartburn and with this it only took one bite!  I love brauts and sauerkraut, but from now on I'll stick to making them on their own!

Made this for our neighborhood Oktoberfest dinner tonight. Followed the recipe exactly - except used large brats which I do not think are links - and it turned out fantastic. I do not like sauerkraut, but my husband does - so I figured he would like it, no problem - but I loved it too. Everyone loved it.

Made tons & I halved the recipe, so I gave some to neighbors. They liked it, but didn't rant nor ask for the recipe. Next time I'd omit tomatos, cumin, chili powder & do more of a white chili maybe add spaetzle, white beans, white pepper, parsley, mustard powder and beef broth. Also, I'll take sausage out of casings & have it be more ground, rather than chunks.

Wow! This chili was amazing. I was skeptical when I read the ingredients, but I decided to give it a try anyway since I had jalapeno & cheddar brats and sauerkraut to use up. I took the advice of another reviewer and used a can of Rotel in substitute of the jalapenos, bell pepper and one can of the petite diced tomatoes. I didn't have a German-style beer on hand, so I used an Irish red that I had in the frig. Incredible! I might even prefer this to “traditional” chili. My friend that doesn’t like sauerkraut even loved it. I will definitely be making this again and again!

Needed an Oktoberfest recipe for a party.  So glad I chose this one.  I loved this spin on chili.    I made it as directed and it was delicious.  Got lots of compliments from the guests.  Will definitely keep and make again.

This chili was really different, tasted mellower the next day. It's very rich. Very good. I used half hot dogs and half brats (what I had) and 2 cans of tomato sauce, 1 can of diced tomatoes. That's all the tomatoes my crockpot had room for. I didn't have any chocolate candy, so used cocoa powder, about a tablespoon. I can see why this recipe has won ribbons!

We made as is, but it was merely OK, and we won't be making it again. The sauerkraut combined with all the tomatoes made the underlying acidity too strong. It's certainly an original recipe, but not for us.

I made this but omitting the sauerkraut, tomato juice, tomato sauce and white sugar. I added black beans and chopped bacon. I cooked it in my crockpot for 5 hours. ??

Loved this strange but delicious chili! I’m German and really enjoy sauerkraut and brats. Also like a good chili so what the heck, cooked this up! My husband said it was the best chili he ever had! I’m a little with a few reviewers that mentioned too much tomato taste... next time I’ll delete some tomatoes or add more chocolate and beer

I'm just a beginner when it comes to cooking and made this quite easily. So if you are having any doubts, don't fret, you can do it. And my oh my! This is the best thing I have made so far and it turned out magnificently. The best chili I've ever had. I followed the recipe precisely except I left out a half pound of brats. I will be making this again and again - hopefully when I have guests but I'm on day 3 of leftovers for myself and its still every bit as good. Enjoy!

Although I was very skeptical of the ingredients I followed the recipe as written (including the chocolate).  I have to say I got rave reviews and this one is a keeper-as is. I did halve the bratwurst after slicing just so it would be more even throughout the dish.  As preference I doubled the jalapenos to four (it is chili).   I also reduced tomatoes just so it would fit in a crockpot (No tomato juice) and I used more diced tomatoes instead of the sauce-we prefer a chunkier chili).  Not sure if the bacon grease is necessary, but the cooked bacon makes a delicious snack while you are preparing the rest of the dish :-)  Almost didn't add allspice either ($7 in the baking aisle) but found in the ethnic aisle for $3.  I used all the seasonings as listed both times I made it.  NO complaints-great recipe!

Awesome chili!  The only thing I changed was to chop the sauerkraut into small bits.  All the flavor with no long strings.

Took the advice in the reviews and substantially decreased the tomato content.  I also removed the sausage meat from the casings and sauteed it like that.  It came out very nice,  although I am not sure that it is different enough from regular chili that I will make it again.

I made it as listed except doubled the minced garlic, cut down on salt by about 1/2, used maple syrup for the sugar and used semi-sweet chocolate - It definitely needs to cook for 5 or more hours (covered or it will get to thick) to dissipate the acidity. It is good but as another reviewer suggested can cause heartburn if eaten straight. I suggest using it for chili dogs with some mustard- it was delicious on hotdogs and didn't give me heartburn. I am sure it will make good chili fries also.

Made a few minor changes according to our tastes and what I had on hand, but otherwise followed directions. My oh so German husband loved it. Combined the best of both worlds for him - American chili and German brats with sauerkraut. I loved it too and normally I am not a big chili fan.

We love it! We follow this recipe exactly and it turns out so good! Word of advice, don't use a dark beer. It makes the chili a little too bitter. We've made this a few times, and like to try different micro brews. Get a nice crusty bread and this is a delicious meal.

I think this is the best chili I have ever had.  My boyfriend liked it better than any that we have made, but didn't consider it the best ever.  Delicious, worked as leftovers and we ate all of it.
