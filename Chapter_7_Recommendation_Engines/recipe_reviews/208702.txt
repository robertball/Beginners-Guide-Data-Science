I used an entire can and could probably have used more to make the sauce even smoother.  Other than that, I followed the recipe with the other measurements, just omitting the bread crumbs because I didn't have any.  I also added some mustard powder for a bit of a kick.  Nice flavour, but do add more evaporated milk.

really good but i think it would be a bit better if the cheese sauce was actually saucier. it left cheese chunks in mine and so it tasted salty. will make again but will alter a bit first

If you like more creamy, saucy mac and cheese I would not do the entire oven part, no breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, 1 cup cheddar cheese.  Up to the point where you mix everything with the pasta, I thought the consistency was heavenly, maybe just 1 teaspoon of salt.  I did the part with the breadcrumbs, cheese and put it in the oven and it got completely dried out and the breadcrumbs were too overpowering. I am going to make it next time minus the entire oven section.

This recipe was pretty easy and tasted good...just wished it was more cheesy. It did remind me of KFC's mac n cheese but theirs is creamier and cheesier. Would make again but would add more cheese.

This was good. I added some smoked turkey sausage. Will make again with a little tweaking.

Loved it! Made it with both of my Home-ec classes. Easy to make and to tweak it and make it more cheddary (?) I added McLaren's Imperial aged chddar. Just a few chunks crumbled in with the grated cheese give it a really reat taste. I like it chunky, so this recipe turned out great.
