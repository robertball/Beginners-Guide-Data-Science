I reduced this Chinese Duk Sauce recipe to fewer servings so that I could compare it with my much more traditional recipe, which takes fewer ingredients. Thanks for posting this recipe, but I will continue making my recipe.

This was the first time I cooked duck and was rather pleased with how it turned out. A lot of people told me duck was greasy (which it is) but this sauce counteracts the greasiness and compliments the flavour of the meat quite nicely. The flavour of the sauce is influenced by the fruit used - tart apples and under-ripe plums made it pleasantly tangy.

I tried a few different recipes for Duck Sauce.  BY FAR, this was the greatest! The others were way too bitter.  It has the consistency of applesauce (after well blended) just like the Duck Sauce in our local Chinese Restaurants in New England! yum!

made this, haven't used it in anything yet, but it tastes good! i made a big change though: i left out the sugar and used water instead of apple juice. and it's just fine. i added a bit more of the apricot preserves and that was sugar free too.
fruit used: apple, pear, apricot and peach.
