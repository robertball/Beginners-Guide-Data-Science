I put 3lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast in a crock pot, then put all the sauce ingredients on top of that.  I cooked it on low for 8 hrs then shredded the chicken pieces.  It was a huge hit with the whole family.  I served it with homemade coleslaw, in which I substituted half of the vinegar in the sauce for tobasco, to give the sandwiches some zing.  Next time, the only thing I will change, I will use tomato sauce instead of ketchup, for the same results with a lower price tag.

One thing I love about this site is the chance to read the reviews for a recipe.  However, I usually don't understand why people change a recipe before they even try it and then review the changes not the original recipe.  I am afraid I am guilty though of doing that this time myself.  The recipe called for 5 T of minced garlic.  Well my jar of minced garlic said that would be equal to 10-15 cloves of garlic so I said no way! I put in only 2 T and it was just right, but I am not a huge garlic fan.  I also bought 3 lbs of boneless chicken breasts and boiled them for almost 3 hours...very tender!  I also put in only 1/2 cup dejon mustard and may only put in 1/3 next time.  And there will be a next time because these sandwiches were FANTASTIC.  I would not recommend using bottled BBQ sauce though because this recipe has a very unique tasts.  Also the slaw is absolutely mandatory so don't leave that off.

i thru boneless chicken breasts and the rest of the stuff in the crockpot on low and let it go for about 4 hours(of course your crockpot may be slower or faster, but it is hard to mess up a crockpot meal:) )..you will know when the chicken is done...thought this recipe was pretty good. it is kinda alot ingredients to buy but if you happen to have them on hand like i did try this.

This is a must make! We took chicken on the bone and placed it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high with a can of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. When it was done the chicken fell right off the bone, making it easy to shred for the sandwich! Then we doubled the sauce and it made for awesome chicken bbq sandwiches esp with the coleslaw on top! Thanks sooo much for the recipe! We will be making this again for sure!

I've never done BBQ chicken and was surprised at how good it was.  I used 6 chicken breasts instead of whole chickens and cut the mustard to 1/2 cup, otherwise followed recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Made about 10 good-sized sandwiches.

I cut this recipe in half. Because I used chicken breasts (two cut in half), I was able to use my small crockpot to make this. This turned out well but it seemed to be missing something. Half a recipe--no leftovers. Whatever was left in the crockpot, my husband ate over the crockpot with a fork.

This recipe is really yummy!! It gave new life to some leftover chicken breasts. Most importantly it was easy to make the sauce and re-heat the chicken. My picky 9 and 11 year old boys loved it!  They normally complain when we have leftovers but I'm getting better at disguising them!!!

This is the kind of recipe that works really well with leftover chicken which is what I had. I also added pepper jack cheese to the sandwich and broiled for a few minutes. Hearty, quick and good Sarina. Thanks!

My family really liked this in pita pockets.  The coleslaw is a must.  It really made it taste great.  We loved it.  I made the recipie for 10 and had enough to freeze for another quick meal.

This was very good.  However, I did make a few changes.  I used split chicken breasts and added 2 chicken-flavored boullion cubes to the water when boiling them.  Also, I doubled all sauce ingredients (except the mustard) and added 2 Tbsp minced onion.

A perfect dish to serve at a large gathering. Tasty but not too spicy for kids. It is easy to keep warm in a crockpot or covered in the oven. Leftovers are as good the 2nd day.  I would urge you to cook a whole chicken,rather than just breasts. The dark meat adds a lot of flavor and you can save the broth for soups,etc.  This sems like a long time to cook a cut up chicken.Mine are usually done in less than an hour at a simmer.

Very tasty! What is nice about this BBQ sauce is that you can control the amount of sweetness and seasonings. I had to scale this down for three people tonight. I used 2 skinless boneless chicken breasts for this recipe. I had 1/2 cup of chicken broth so I put that into a pot with the sauce. Once the sauce came up to a boil I added the chicken meat, covered it with a lid, and let it simmer on low for 4 hours. By this time the chicken meat was tender. I shred the chicken meat and let it sit in all its juices. I lightly toasted the hamburger buns under an oven broiler before topping with the meat and sauce mixture. I prepared, "Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I," from this website, which is VERY good I must add. With the bbq chicken topped with coleslaw, this makes a good match and satisfying meal. The chicken meat is juicy and tender. In every bite I have a mouthful of flavorful bbq sauce which is both sweet and slightly "tangy". My family thought it a bit too tangy for their tastes but I really like it. I plan to keep the sauce recipe in mind for other bbq meats or marinades only I will have to tone it down a bit on the mustard, lemon juice and garlic. This went perfectly with our hot buttered corn on the cobs.

Excellent and easy!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used my slow cooker.  I used 2.5 chicken breasts (about 1.5 lbs) and Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce since I had it on hand.  When the chicken was done, I shredded it in the slow cooker with 2 forks.

These sandwiches are delicious. I did feel the need to make a minor modification because I like my barbecue a little more 'saucy.' I made 1 1/2 batches of the sauce for the amount of chicken called for in this recipe. The sauce itself had a really nice, sweet & smokey flavor. If you're looking for a spicy BBQ, you probably would need to add some cayenne or hot sauce.

Only BBQ Chicken recipe I use. Only thing I did different, was to NOT add the 5 Tbsp of garlic. Other than that, followed recipe. Very good!

This was excellent!  I agree, the cole slaw really made the sandwich and blended so well with the flavors of the barbeque sauce!  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to not shred the chicken so finely.  It ended up getting a little mushy, and I like mine a bit chunkier.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Sarina!!!

This sauce is fabulous. My son made this with boneless chicken breasts, double the sauce, and used a crock pot for 4 hours. I have made just the sauce to go with veggie burgers. The sauce alone is much better than any bottled sauce I have tasted!

My hubby and I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I used dijon mustard because that was all I had on hand, and I think that altered the recipe a bit, so I do plan on trying this recipe again with regular mustard.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken breast (sliced them into strips) and just threw everything in a crockpot (just love my crockpot)--the chicken was falling apart when I tried to pick it up.  I then used two forks to shred--which was a litle bit of a pain with thin strips.  Next time I'm going to use the full breasts, then try shredding them whole which should be a bit easier.  All and all, we loved the recipe and plan on using it again.  thank you!

EXCELLENT recipe! I use boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  Boil the chicken for 3-4 hours then shred with two forks. (We always Double the ingredients for the sauce because it has come out more dry than what we like in the past) Prepare sauce just before you shred the chicken. Place chicken in Crockpot on Low and add your sauce! It's also amazing with Coleslaw! Definite keeper!

These were delicious! Followed the recipe to a tee! It was so easy, just threw everything in the crockpot and didn't touch it for atleast 6 hours, the chicken just fell apart....so tender and delicious. I added pepperjack cheese to the sandwich and it added the perfect zing. I will definately make these again. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I forgot to mention that I used boneless skinless chicken breast...personal preference.

This was well recieved here. The Hungry Teen had two. Nice sweet flavor that has some kick as well. I used Lea & Perrins steak sauce, BLSL chicken breasts, and cut this recipe in half. Nice little sandwiches. We'd eat these again. My husband is taking most of this to work for his lunches, but we got a small one before packing his up. (Except the teen who had two large sandwiches and gave this a double thumbs up while his mouth was still full.) Thanks Sarina for a great recipe that even has a homemade sauce.

Now this was yummy!  It was soooo easy too.  I love that you can cook the chicken and sauce ahead of time, then put it all together and heat later in the day.  I used boneless chicken breast so it took hardly any time to boil them.  I also used brown mustard instead of yellow (the recipe didn't specify which to use).  I didn't taste the "weird tang" that I read some people tasted.  I was wondering if that could have been caused by using yellow mustard and not brown, this is why I opted for brown.  I needed a good recipe to serve for when my hubby's friends come over and this is definitely it!  I made it my official Saturday night meal as well!   Perfect for the weekends.  I served it with steamed corn on the cob and a salad, delicious!

Increased this to feed 30 football players...instead of sandwiches, browned the chicken in chunks, added the BBQ sauce, simmered 45 mins.  We then made wraps using flour tortilla shells.  Use wraps NOT refridgerated so they don't split while rolling up.  We had so many high-5's and rave reviews from the bus windows that this was the only after game sack lunch that was repeated.  The Best!  Go Greyhounds!! Thanks for sharing.

It's a pretty easy recipe. I gave it three stars because there is way too much mustard for my taste. I think it would be perfect with about half as much.

Any time my oldest eats four of anything it gets 5 stars.  He's way too picky. This was a hit at the cottage with everyone.  I did do boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the crockpot but followed the directions for everything else.  Will make again and again.

This is a wonderful recipe! My ENTIRE very picky family loved it. It has loads of flavor without being overwhelmingly spicy. Unfortunately my family is not pro-garlic, so I decreased the garlic amount to 2 teaspoons of powdered garlic which is the equivalant of 6 cloves.
Also, I don't like dark meat and I made this for a crowd, so I used 12 of the costco frozen Tyson chicken breasts that I boiled for about 45 minutes. I also doubled the sauce and it made the 12 shredded breasts nice and goopy. :) YUM!

As I was throwing all the ingredients into the bowl, I was really skeptical, but once everything was in there the sauce smelled amazing! I cut back on the garlic because I thought it seemed like too much, but next time I will use all 5 TBSP. I only used 1/2 cup of mustard because my husband can only eat it if it's well disguised. I took the advice of another reviewer and used 4 large chicken breasts and threw everything in the slow cooker. I kept a good eye on it and began shredding some of it here and there as it cooked.

As recommended in other reviews, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and cooked them with everything in the crockpot on low (mine cooks hot, so they only took 3 1/2 hrs).  Instead of steak sauce I used Worchestershire sauce, which turned out fine, and I bought french bread rolls from the grocery bakery, as well as a tub of coleslaw.  Absolutely delicious!!!  This is going in my permanent recipe collection.

This recipe is the best. I do not eat pork and tried this at a relatives home. I came home and immediatly made it for my family. They devoured it. Two 4lb chickens made way too much chicken though but we enjoyed it for a few days so that was ok. Definitely don't leave the cole slaw off. It makes the sandwich!

The chicken was super tender. We liked this. At first when I tated the sauce I didn't like it, but as it cooked for the recomended time it mellowed out as was yummy. BONUS: What was great was the chicken broth I was left with after cooking the chicken for so long. I froze it and used it later!

GREAT sauce!  I made an 8 serving recipe.  For the prepared mustard, I substituted half of the stated amount with honey mustard.  I also used seasoned salt and omitted the lemon juice (didn't have any on hand).  It was a delicious meal and a definite keeper!

Being from Texas, I guess you just can't get close to real BBQ chicken.  We did not care for this recipe.  The liquid smoke flavoring doesn't match real BBQ on the grill.  Won't ever make this again.

Great recipe! I made this in my crock pot. I didn't have any steak sauce, so I added worcestershire sauce instead. I also omitted the honey, I'm glad I did because just with the sugar was already very sweet. Also, this chicken freezes really well.

This turned out good but only because I added a entire bottle of Bulls Eye BBQ. I put everything in a crockpot and the sauce had a weird tang and was really watery. Not a typical BBQ sauce.

I made this recipe with just boneless chicken breast.  Everything else was exactly the same.  I did add my special slaw to the wrap (I used Flat Out Light Wraps).  Everyone looked back at the sandwich and said a second time, "This is REALLY good.  I gave it a "5" star because it was very, very tasty.  I love Allrecipes.com!

I followed the recipe exactly and it gets an ok rating. I think it's the lemon juice/liquid smoke combo which gives it an odd tang. If I make this again, I would substitute good old cider vinegar for the lemon juice. Also, I would definitely NOT add any liquid smoke till the sauce has cooked through a bit and even then, add in by drops/taste. (I simmered it on very low for about 45 minutes). The stated amount of liquid smoke seemed to overpower everything. I ended up doctoring it by adding a tablespoon of cider vinegar and a good squirt of KC Masterpiece. Sorry.

I spent 3 hours in the kitchen this morning so I would have the perfect BBQ Chicken Sandwich.  I started with the homemade buns, and then worked on the BBQ Chicken and then I used Paula Deen's Coleslaw Recipe for the topping.  The sandwich looked like a 5 star sandwich when I was finished with it. It was good too, but was way to sweet for me.  It just boils down to personal preference, and I like BBQ spicy and not too sweet.  If you prefer a sweet BBQ sauce you will really enjoy this recipe.

I do this with chicken breast in the crock-pot.  I followed some of the advice I read here and just threw all the ingrediants in together--I didn't even thaw the chicken.  It came out great!

Mid summer & I don't want another hamburger, So I tried something new. WOW! Love this recipe. I made it for a crowd & it multiplied very easily.  I used boneless breasts and thighs instead of entire chickens (who has that kind of time) I let it simmer for a few hours like it said to and the meat just fell appart.  10Lbs of chicken shredded by fork in 15 minutes.  I made everything the night before.  The sauce I put together minus the smoke & let it sit overnight in the fridge w/o cooking it.  Next day I added the smoke, put it all in the crock pot mixed it & let it go. I also made a simple slaw & I say, it is a must on the sandwich. My guests said they would "try" the sandwich and use hotdogs as back up. 10 dogs and 8 left in the pot! They ate 3 sandwhiches each, slaw & all! Hubby said "This goes in the favorites book"  THANKS!

I made this for a potluck dinner and served with homemade cole slaw and wheat kaiser rolls.  It turned out great!  I did change it up a bit though (everyone has their own bbq sauce preferences).  I cooked the sauce on the stovetop and doctored it up as I was cooking it by tasting it.  I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, 1 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup mustard, and only 2Tbsp of dried minced garlic.  All the rest was the same, but added 1 Tbsp of Tabasco and 2 Tbsp of cider vinegar.  I used Gulden's brown mustard.

I used 3.5 pounds of boneless chicken breasts, threw them into the crockpot.  Simmered the sauce on the stove for 10 minutes, and then threw it over the top of the chicken.  Cooked on high for about 4 hours.  Pulled the chicken out, shredded it with two forks.  Added some of the sauce from the pot, but then served the rest of the sauce on the side so people could make it as gloppy as they wanted.

I would definitely make this again!  It would be great for a casual backyard bbq/party.  I would also like to try using half breast meat and half boneless skinless thighs.  I would have done that this time, but my store only had "natural" boneless/skinless thighs that were pretty expensive.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for in a homemade BBQ chicken sandwich.  Next  time I will cut back on the lemon juice, because it was a tad tangy; I like my BBQ sauce a little sweeter.  I didn't have the liquid smoke, but it came out great anyway.  This recipe went in my "permanent" recipe box.

I used whole chickens we roasted on the bbq.  Peeled the meat off the bone and put it in the sauce.  What a hit!!!  I am glad it makes a good amount I ended up feeding my family and half of their friends and some neighbors!  Everyone loved it!  My picky son who never likes anything said he would eat it again if I made it.  Wow!  I really don't care for bbq sauce and I even loved it.  I will pass this on and make it again!  A must try!

Much better than simply adding bbq sauce to shredded chicken.  However, it seems like there is too much mustard, and the balance of flavors is just a little off.  I suppose everyone's tastes are a little different.  It's definately a starting point though where I can make it into something I love.  Thanks!

I made this the first time as written and only rated it 3 stars.  I'm editing my review today because yesterday I made it and took the advice of numerous reviewers and it was fantastic!  I needed a crockpot meal since we'd be getting home really late from high school sports so I threw about 3 lbs. of skinless, boneless breasts into the crockpot.  Cooked the sauce as directed (cutting down the garlic to about 2 Tbsp.).  Poured it over the breasts and cooked on low for 8 hours.  The breasts were so tender and easily shredded with a fork into the sauce.  I served on sandwich rolls with cole slaw as recommended.  So easy for a busy night!  They all loved it.

I used 4 & ¾ lbs boneless-skinless thighs (they were on sale). Mixed 1 packet of ‘Herb-Ox Sodium-Free Chicken Bullion’ dissolved in 1c of water, dumped it in the Crock Pot, and then dumped in the thighs. I set the Crock Pot for Hi, for 4 hours. Poured off most of the broth it created (LOTS!) I made some changes to the sauce, according to posted suggestions. I used ½ ketchup & ½ crushed tomatoes (had some leftover), Worcestershire instead of steak sauce & Dijon mustard (it was all I had on hand). Don’t be too concerned that the sauce tastes strong. I was, so I added it to the chicken a bit at a time, wound up using it all and it came out great! Lots of flavor, good moisture and lots of compliments from guests! Don't forget to serve it with cole slaw! I suggest bagged, Dole cole slaw with whatever dressing you like, instead of the soggy stuff you buy in a tub.

Love these. Except I kinda cheated... I used bulleye BBQ sauce LOL I guess kinda missing the whole point of the reciepe but it was cheaper than buying all the ingrediants. Anyways thought coleslaw on my sandwich would be gross.... but seriously.... it made the sandwich. Thanks for the idea.

Made this the other day when my kids came over. Followed the recipe x  We smoked 3 whole chickens the day before and deboned them. The following day added all ingredients together plus a little hot sauce for kick, and slow cooked it the oven until warmed through. My family loved it.

Very good, I cut down the time to about 45min by cutting boneless skinless chicken breasts in half and cooking them in chicken broth on the stove. Also added a bit of oregano and smoked paprika to kick up the flavor bit.

We tried this recipe for a game. I followed the sauce recipe exact except I used half the garlic and omitted the liquid smoke because we smoked the chicken and we got rave reviews from EVERYONE! We served the chicken on sour dough hoagie rolls and had the option of putting on cole slaw. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good!  I cooked a whole chicken in the crockpot all day and then, rather than mixing it into the sauce I just drizzled sauce onto the sandwiches.  Even though I didn't use honey, it still came out super sweet...  but aren't most bbq sauces sweet?  I'll make this one again.

I made this recipe exactly as written and was greatly disappointed.  WAY too much work and with all the ingredients I would have expected better flavor.  I ended up adding a cup of regular BBQ sauce to make this edible.

This is my new favorite dish to make for a crowd.  It's easy to make a huge batch ahead of time and let it simmer on the stove until you need it.

Tastes great, everyone loves it!  I omit the liquid smoke and reduce the garlic, and I use cheap chicken legs.

I made this last night for dinner.  It was great, (I scaled the servings down to 4 instead of 8) I was a little skeptical because of the ketchup and other readers posts about the taste. But all you need to do is be sure to let it simmer down so all the flavors can meld (at least 10-15 min. before adding chicken and then another 10 or so after).  We like a little heat to our sauce so I added a 1/2 tsp. onion powder and a tablespoon of chili powder, and a tiny cap full of white distilled vinegar. Also used 5 chicken legs boiled for about 30 min and then chopped. My husband was worried it would be to sweet but once I served it on the toasted bun he said it was perfect. Will definitely make it again.

Made these sandwiches yesterday, and they came out great!  Yum!  I used the recipe with one package of chicken breast (about 2 lbs).  I added about 2 Tbsp hot sauce and 2 Tbsp cayenne (we like our food with a lot of zing!).  Also used molasses instead of honey - am nursing an infant.  The sauce was so tangy and good!  I used the Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I recipe on this site.  Will definitely be making these again!

If you love bbq meat that doesn't taste like it came right out of a bottle then you can't go wrong with this recipe- flavorful and delicious.  Great in a crockpot!

I used a raspberry chiplote sauce instead
of the steak sauce which gives the sauce
a little more kick. Served on fresh onion
buns and the whole family really liked the
quick meal.

I suspect the mustard measurement is incorrect. The recipe calls for 3/4 C...I put in 1/2 C and found it still to be way too much. The mustard also altered the color of the sauce, making it much lighter and not look like bbq sauce at all. I'll reduce to 1/4 C or less if I make this again.  Otherwise not bad.

the only change is that I only used 3 tablespoons of garlic other than that it was perfect, will be using the sauce recipe to make pulled pork sandwiches.

Not as much BBQ flavor as I would have hoped for.  Good chicken, but I think I might use a different sauce recipe next time.

Being a vegan, I veganized this recipe and it turned out fantastic. I used Quorn faux chick'n and maple syrup in place of the honey. Other than those changes I followed the recipe. I'll definitely make this again.

It gave a strong mustard taste to it almost to much so I add   a sweet roll and that took the taste of the sauce and made it much better .

Yum!"Kewlness" is what my daughter said.  Great recipe.  We used only chicken breasts as that is what we like.  We also doubled the sauce and saved half in the fridge.  Planning to get a rotissere (sp?) chicken and use with the rest of the sauce for a quick sandwich on a busy night.

Doubled this and served it to company. Daring, huh? Well, everyone really liked it, even the children. I didn't use all the mustard as my hubby doesn't care for it that much. It's a little sweeter than most BBQ's and really good with the slaw on top!! I'll definitely make this again.

the chicken was great - whole family enjoyed it.  I halved the recipe and it still made a ton.  Except for halving the sauce, I made exactly as recipes states.  For the chicken, I used bone in breasts and cooked them in the pressure cooker to speed up cooking time.

This recipe was pretty good. As I was making it though I discovered that I had ran out of liquid smoke and that the sauce had an unusual "tang" to it. I added 1/2 bottle Kraft bbq sauce to it and it was great!

This was great! I only made one change, only because I didn't have enough ketchup. I subbed 1/4 c of ketchup for bbq sauce. It made the sauce sweeter, so I will probably skip that next time. I also like things spicier, so I'll probably add some hot sauce when I make it again. Delicious!

OMW! A big hit recently while family did some yardwork. I cooked 2 chickens on the grill, sauce on the side burner. Shredded the chicken then added the sauce. Used honey wheat sandwich recipe submitted by P. Kaiser. Definitely a keeper :D:D:D

OMG this has to be the best BBQ chicken sandwich ever.I did change it a bit but you will not be dissapointed at all.what i did was boiled 6 boneless skinless chicken breast for 25 minutes i prepared everything last night so that we could have them today. i boiled the chicken shredded it and put it aside while i was preparing the sauce. i used 1  15 oz can tomato sauce 1/2 cup of ketchup,1/2 cup mustard, i cut back on the sugar and used 4 tabls instead of 5 i used4 tbls fresh minced Italian garlic,4 tablesppons of honey as with the sugar i didnt want it to be over powering with sweetness, i didnt have the steak sauce so that was omitted. i used three tbls lemon juice instead of 4, 2 tbls liquid smoke , omitted the salt and only used 1 tsp pepper, and i used a dash of onion powder & two dashes of tobasso sweet & spicy sauce and a pinch of asian chili paste. i simmered it for 20 minutes let it cool and put in the the frig for today then i heated up just enough for our sandwiches covering the chicken to our liking simmered it for 20 minutes put it on our buns  i used whole wheat . i cheated a little and used deli coldslaw added a little on top of our sandwiches enough for everones liking they turned out awesome, this is a keeper for sure . next time i will add a little more chili paste or tobassco to heat it up a little more .you wont be dissapointed in this recipe thats for sure. i would change the rating and make this a 10

Tastes yummy. Added  four splashes of Frank's Red Hot to it for more flavour. And used on normal slices of chicken breast (not boiled). I just frying the thinly sliced chicken over the sauce for 15 minutes and they were cooked and delicious!

a little too tangy for us, but it was still pretty good and a great idea I'm keeping this but will tweak it.

I used the crock pot for this preparation and the sauce did not taste like barbeque at all.  To save the dish since I had company coming, I drained the sauce off completely, added Stubs Barbeque sauce ,Hot Chipotle Sauce, some homemade sweet barbeque sauce I had in the refrigerator, and 2 teaspoons of Paprika.  What an awesome barbeque that was!!!!!

Well, I had all of this on hand so I thought I'd give it a try.  Threw the chicken with half of the sauce into the crockpot.  When chicken was done, shredded it and added the rest of the sauce to simmer for 30 more minutes.  I found the sauce very different than what I'm used to here in Texas.  I did reduce the amount of garlic and mustard because wow it was a lot!  Reminds me of that orange sauce you can get in a bottle(the name of it escapes me at this moment), as it is very tangy even with the addition of the liquid smoke.  I think I'll stick with something more suited to our tastes, but I can appreciate the new experience.

This was a hit at our 4th of July party even without the coleslaw. Doubled the recipe, used boneless skinless chicken breasts cooked in the crockpot. Don't leave out the Liquid Smoke--it makes the sauce.

This sandwich was really good. We both loved it.  I used a bottle of sauce instead of making the sauce. I put the chicken (I used chicken breasts) and the sauce in the crock pot and cooked on high for 6 hours. Topped with the cole slaw and mozzarella cheese. Yum!
