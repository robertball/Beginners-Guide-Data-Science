I made this for Christmas brunch and it was excellent.  I forgot to add the hash browns and it still turned out great.  The next day I popped one in the microwave for 30 seconds and it tasted like it was fresh out of the oven.  You don't need the baking cups.  Just grease your muffin tins and place mixture directly in the tin.  The cooking time in my oven was exact.  I will definitely make this again.

Really good! I just made these and used half the sausage. They were perfect. Rather than mixing everything together, I sprayed my muffin tin with Pam, put the sausage/veg/cheese mixture in the tins evenly and then poured the egg mixture in, evenly. Popped right out of the pan, delish!

Let me first say that these are DELICIOUS.  I did make some changes, but I followed the recipe fairly closely.  Instead of regular pork sausage, I used the pre-cooked crumbled turkey sausage.  Not only does it save time, but it saves a lot of fat and calories too. I loaded the quiche with veggies: zuchinni, green onion, bell pepper and carrots.  By adding so many veggies, I was able to get 24 mini quiches out of this recipe.  By following a previous tip of putting the sausage mixture into the muffin tin and topping with egg, I had NO problem getting the quiches out of the pan.  I did not use any paper liners.  Once out of the oven, I flipped the quiches on to a baking sheet and put them in the freezer so I could then put them into a ziploc bag.  Making a big batch of these and freezing them allows me to have quiche anytime!  Just put two in the microwave for a minute and enjoy!

I have taken these to several breakfast events, and they are always a hit!  Recipe works great in a mini muffin tin, which makes bite-sized mini quiches.  Makes 30-36, depending on how full you fill the cups.  You may have to add 1 or 2 more eggs.  I liked someone else's idea of putting sausage and veggies in cups first and then adding egg mixture.  Reduced baking time to 16-18 minutes.  Great recipe!

Fantastic, you can do a lot with this recipe! Had for guests and everyone chowed them! I followed the recipe but didn't have hash browns, and just did red and yellow pepper, not green. It set up perfectly, I didn't use baking cups.

Ok - I just tried this recipe for the first time and it was a hit at the brunch today. I followed the recipe fairly close but made a few minor changes after reading all the reviews. First, I used half or the recommended sausage. Second, I did not use baking cups but sprayed a non-stick olive oil spray and had no problems. They came right out of the pan. Third, the only vegetable that I added were the green onions as this was a family brunch with a lot of young children attending. I used both cheddar (1/2 cup) and mozzarella (1/4 cup) and I sprinkled a small amount of grated parmesan cheese on top of the un-baked mixture. Then I baked them. I also added the southern style hash brown potatoes and it made twelve regular size quiches. Very good - everyone loved them and this will now be a holiday regular for us.

These were very easy to make, and they were delicious!  Since they were cooked in a muffin tin, I was able to add the ingredients my daughter and I wanted in some of the quiches while I left out the optional ingredients in the quiches for my picky husband.

I took to a ladies Bible study and they ate them up and even asked for the recipe.  I used sage sausage instead of regular.  I also left out onions.

I used evaporated milk in this recipe for a richer flavor and added a good amount of fresh minced garlic and a little red pepper flake. I did take the recipe suggestion and sprinkle the top of each omelette cup with parmesan. These were unbelieveably good.  NOTE: I've made something like this before so I knew to measure out about 1/4 cup of the egg mixture into each muffin tin without over/underfilling. I was able to get nine mini omelettes out of one recipe, not twelve.

I used the hash browns, which made these more like mini breakfast bakes than quiches. But they were still super easy to make and fun for my guests. I love how adaptable the recipe is, and that it is gluten-free. I chose to grease my muffin tin rather than use muffin cups - probably not the best decision, as it was very difficult to scrub out the baked-on egg. These stored in the refrigerator well, so I was able to make them in advance and reheat quickly the morning I needed them. I will definitely make these again.

Really good but extremely salty (for me, no need to add any salt). Forgot to add the hash browns, but will make again with that addition.

My family liked these, along with slices of pineapple.  I forgot the salt & pepper in the egg mixture. (Not good to forget the seasonings.)  I  compensated by sprinkling each quiche with salt & pepper.  I plan to make these again, experimenting with different meat and cheeses.

I love this recipe- very quick and easy.  I was able to customize each cup for each person without doing a lot of work.  I did saute the hash browns and veggies together, did the meat on the side of the veggies so I could do a veggie option, or mixed (I used turkey kielbasa and chorizo) before I put into the cups- and they were all tender and very flavorful.  I did not use baking cups.  Instead, I smeared butter in the inside of the cups so the wouldn't stick, and they came right out.  Very light and fluffy.  Will become a staple!

This was great! I had to substitute a couple of ingredients just because I didn't have everything on hand, but the recipe has a great "kitchen sink" quality to it which makes it really versatile. I already have lots of ideas for different combinations. :)

This is a great recipe and it made 18 muffins.   I used roasted pablano peppers and 1/2 onion and a fresh tomato. Next time I will a little jalapeno.

I followed this recipe to a "T" In the end, the sausage was way too overpowering. We like our meat, but I would actually cut it in half if I ever make this again. Also, it says it makes 12, but I needed to quickly scramble a couple of more eggs to make that work. I'd highly recommend adding additional herbs/spices as well.

The great recipe followed it to the T. Except I didn't have the hash browns. They were light and fluffy. The next time I make these I will spray my muffin tin with Pam or olive oil. The foil cups that I thought I had were actually foil on the outside paper on the inside, So they did stick and were difficult to get the paper cups off.

First time I made this was for a Christmas brunch several years ago, and it was a surprise hit. A friend's daughter who never eats eggs ate two! I don't bother using the foil cups; spraying the muffin tins with Pam works just fine. I've made this a few times since then for various brunch events. Something about them is just way tastier than other egg muffin recipes.

Great base recipe to play with! I pretty much followed the directions. I did use sliced summer squash, but you can easily tailor this to suit your taste or whatever you may have on hand. I made them on a Sunday night, for an easy weekday breakfast. They were great warmed up. Will be making again.

Excellent for quick breakfast. Added a couple of squirts of Franks hot sauce to egg mixture for some heat. If you place the sausage at bottom of muffin pan then add egg mixture, no need to spray. Crispy cooked Crumbled bacon or ham works as well. Never make it to the freezer, husband eats 2-3 at a time. Well worth making.

I'm sorry but I really didn't like these.  I think maybe if I had adjusted some things but I don't like to "mess" with recipes initially.  They were so very greasy (and I did drain my sausage).  If making again, I would use less than half a pound of sausage or maybe a turkey sausage?  I loved the list of ingredients though.  I may try again as another reviewer said they freeze well and I would really like that.
