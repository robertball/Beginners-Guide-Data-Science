I was pretty unimpressed.  Not at all zesty, even though I added Franks Red Hot and some Hickory Seasoning (Liquid Smoke).  Tasted a lot like my moms homemade sloppy joes.  Bland enough that kids might like, except its chunky, which turns mine right off.  I won't use this recipe again.  Sorry Micky!!

This sauce is pretty good but I made a few changes. I used brown sugar instead of white, balsamic vinegar instead of white, and 1/2 tsp of celery seed (instead of celery pc's) and 1 tsp of onion powder instead of onion. It just made the sauce smoother. I also used 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/2 cup of hp sauce. My husband loves it and I keep a jar in the fridge now :)

Excellent "base" sauce, and as the author says--you can zip it up your way! I followed the recipe to a "T" and found a light, tangy sauce for almost anything. YOU MUST LIKE A SLIGHTLY TEXTURED SAUCE TO ENJOY THIS ONE---it is slightly chunky. Good idea to really saute' the veggies well before adding the other ingredients. I did add another tablespoon brown sugar along with a dash or two of hot sauce to zip it up a bit. Wonderful and easily earns a HIGH 5!!!

I made this on a whim and I am soooo glad I did! I took the advice of some other reviews and used Brown Sugar instead of White and I used Balsamic vinegar instead of white. I used a teaspoon of Spicy Brown Mustard instead of dry mustard too. I also added a half cup of reagular bbq sauce from my fridge because I didn't want the ending sauce to have a too much of a ketchup taste. When you mix the ingredients together the sauce looks - well - scary! I asked myself, "do I really want to try this?" But I trusted Mickey (haha) and went with it! I have become known for my BBQ now thanks to this sauce!! I slow cook 6 to 8 chicken breasts on LOW for 6 hours. Then I shred the chicken (pulling the meat apart a little at a time with 2 forks) and then I put the shredded meat back in the sauce and slow cook overnight on LOW. Allowing the meat to soak up the sauce makes this BBQ GREAT!!! I always make it for when we have parties and guests-- it is a crowd pleaser FOR SURE! Thanks Mickey- whoever you are!

This BBQ sauce is a very nice and tangy topping for almost anything.  I made it for my family with pork ribs and they loved it so much that they wanted to eat it out of the pan!  I do however add a little extra lemon and some hamburger spices. It helps to make the flavor a little more bold and give it extra zing.

I put this on grilled chicken and it was nice. Needs a little more of a kick. I did like having celery in the sauce, that was a different ingredient that I will put in all my BBQ sauces now.
