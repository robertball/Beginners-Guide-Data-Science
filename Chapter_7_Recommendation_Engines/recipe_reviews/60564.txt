I think I know why everyone complained about density. The measurements for the flour are for sifted flour not the amount to be sifted. Sift the cake flour and then measure the amount to be put into the cake. The batter seems to be runny, but bakes up fluffy

I am a caterer as well and have not found a good strawberry cake recipe until now!  My daughter asked for a Strawberry cake I had to find a recipe.  Everyone LOVED it, even my picky eater that does not like strawberries! It is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing. I made the recipe like I do all of my cakes and it came out fluffy and moist.  I seperated the egg whites and yolks. Whipped the whites into soft peaks and folded them in at the end.  I also always line the pans with parchment paper, this keeps them from sticking to the bottom.

My sister and I made this cake the day before Easter Sunday and let it sit in the refrigerator until we served it for dessert... it was WONDERFUL!!! We took three recommendations from reviews that really helped the strawberry cake to turn out great! 
1~ We seperated the egg whites and yolks and whipped the egg whites and then added them in to the mixture.     2~ Also we sifted the flour and then after sifting measured it again. 
3~ We spread strawberry puree in between the two cake layers along with icing to make them stick together well. (mmmmm!!!:D)Furthermore we made the strawberry puree by blending clean, cut strawberries together in the blender which made a really fresh puree. As a finishing touch, after icing the entire cake with vanilla icing, we placed extra sliced strawberries on the top of the cake! The cake was BIG hit but make sure to make room in the refrigerator for leftovers!

A little sweet for me, but Hubs loved it.  Pretty pink, lots of strawberry flavor.  I creamed the butter, sugar and gelatin well, as directed, adding the eggs one at a time and beating well after each addition. I added the flour in thirds with the milk AND the strawberry puree, beginning and ending with the flour. This differed from the instruction to add the puree at the end.  To give the cake a little extra lift I used a full tablespoon of baking powder.  Also, salt makes flavor come alive, so I added a teaspoon.  The batter was so light, fluffy and voluminous I felt better using three pans rather than two and I'm glad I did.  I filled the cake with my own strawberry buttercream: 2 c.  powdered sugar, 1/2 c. butter, approximately 2 T. of sweetened strawberry puree and a dribble of strawberry extract.  It was awesome good and complemented the cake perfectly.  I frosted the cake with "Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting," also from this site, which Hubs and I both agree was a major disappointment and, in our opinion, ruined what otherwise would have been a perfect cake.  The strawberry buttercream I made for the filling would have been perfect to frost the cake as well and in hindsight I wish I would have done that. This cake is fluffy, moist and flavorful - pretty too! If I have any criticism at all, it would be that using the gelatin kind of turned me off. I would much rather find a true "Strawberry Cake from SCRATCH" that didn't use it.

I wanted to make a cake from scratch for my wife's birthday when I came across this recipe.  After reading all of the reviews I carefully measured the flour after sifting and I beat the egg-whites separately.  I used slightly less flour and butter hoping to make the cake fluffier.  It still ended up being a fairly dense cake (but still delicious).

I made the strawberry puree from scratch just using strawberries and sugar.

For the frosting I used a homemade whip cream with more strawberry puree.

I used 3x 9" pans for a triple layer cake.  In between the layers I placed thinly sliced strawberries on top of a thin layer of icing.  I covered those with splashes of the strawberry puree then added more frosting.

To top it off I soaked halved strawberries in more puree and placed them on top.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it didn't come out as fluffy as I would have liked.  However I'm not much of a baker so it's just as likely my fault as it is the recipe.  But my wife loved it so I'm in her good graces until next year!

I was very pleasantly suprised with this cake. There was so many reviewers claiming that the cake was too dense. I think that the problem maybe that they used 2 pans instead of 3. I went with my instinct and used three 9 inch cake pans and did everything else the same and my cake came out wonderful, very light and fluffy. I used the remaining strawberry puree, mixed it with some extra chopped strawberries, sprinkled it with sugar and a little cornstarch. After mixing it and letting it sit, I poured it between the layers and frosted the top and sides with my buttercream frosting. Delish, to say the least!! The cake itself was defenitely better than any boxed version, a keeper!!

I am so glad I read the reviews-this turned out great with some tweaking! Here's what I did different from the original:
* sifted cake flour, then measured out
* separated yolk/white and beat whites to soft peaks, then folded in at the end
* reduced sugar to 1 3/4 c.(will try 1.5 c. next time)
* baked in three, 9 in. pans
* frosting=two store bought vanillas and 1/3 c. puree (plus a little red food color)
Cake was dense, moist and great! I liberally coated/greased/floured the pans, put wax paper on bottom, too. I really want to try this with raspberries as a local baker that is now out of business had the best raspberry cake and frosting. This turned out great! Thanks!

I made this cake today and took it to work.  What an AWESOME cake!  I had some strawberries that I had to use up and am I ever glad I checked here first!  I did make it in a 13x9 inch pan instead of the double layer.  Baked it for 45 minutes (glass).  Then made a "fluff" topping made of 1/2 cool whip and 1/2 cream cheese.  I whipped these together till smooth and then stirred in about a cup of finely chopped strawberries.  Did I ever get the rave reviews.  Each person actually took a piece of cake and then spooned the "fluff" over that.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

For those of you who complained about the cake being too dense, try cutting back on your flour.  A standard cake recipe usually calls for about 2 1/4 cups of flour, not the amount listed.  That amount would work well if your 9" pans were at least 2" deep, and most standard ones that we have in our kitchens are not.  Also, decrease sugar down to 1 cup.  The gelatin is going to add a LOT of sweetness...I found this out the hard way making this recipe with a boxed cake mix.  It was way too sweet for me, but everyone else loved it.  I also cut back to only 3 eggs and took everyone's suggestion and whipped the eggs whites, folding them in at the end.  Also I only used 1/2 cup of butter but also added 1/2 cup of oil.  I kept the milk the same and actually blended the strawberries, milk, and oil all together to make a puree, almost milkshake-like in texture and added it to the creamed sugar, butter, and eggs.  Then I mixed in the flour just for a minute and continued to stir by hand, so as not to over-beat the batter.  My cake came out perfectly, very moist (a little delicate, but the boxed version did, too), and just the right amount of sweetness.  My cake is going to get lots of whipped cream and a white-chocolate custard filling between the layers.  :-)  --You can make your own cake flour by taking out 2 Tbsp. of flour from each cup and adding 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch back in.  Sift 4-5 times, THEN scoop out the amount you need.--

Made it for my daughter's party and had a 2, 3 and 4 year old who ate ALL the cake and icing (instead of just the icing) and asked for seconds.  It was moist and yummy. I beat the egg whites separately and added them last and used parchment paper on the bottom of the pans.  Very sweet and tasty.  Used Cream cheese icing recipe from the allrecipes.com's "walnut rasberry torte" which uses sweetened cream cheese and unsweetened whipped cream to make the icing.  Not too sweet and perfect for the sweet strawberry cake.

This cake turned out absolutely delicious but the reason I am giving it 3 stars is because it can be a bit tricky to make. Definitely follow the recipe exactly, otherwise it can turn out a bit dense. I make mine in a 9x13 cake pan. For a yummy light frosting, I blended together 8 oz of cream cheese, with a container of cool whip and 1 tsp of vanilla.

I would give this recipe 5 stars for taste, but it came out so soft that the whole thing fell apart.  I followed the directions exactly and it still came out so moist that it fell apart.  My family just picked it apart though and everyone loved the taste!

This is a good recipe. I did use the suggestions made by Trish... cutting the sugar back to 1 cup, cutting the eggs to 3, and cutting the flour to 2 1/4 cups. I also separated the eggs, and whipped to stiff peaks, then folded into the batter to finish it. I made cupcakes so that my client could sample the cake before I make her birthday cake in January. One of the things I may do to tweak the recipe further is to add some freshly grated lemon zest to the recipe, and possibly a lemon simple syrup used once the cake layers are baked. Strawberries and lemon go so well together, and the lemon only enhances the strawberry flavor. I'll let you know how it turns out.

I've made this cake about 5 times & everybody loves it.  I always use fresh strawberries & I wondered why 2 T of vanilla; was it supposed to be 2 t?  It always rised really nice, but the last 2 times the cake fell to about half the size.  I don't know what I did, but I sure would like to correct that.  
Thanks, Doudell

I reeeeeeally wanted to love this cake but I couldn't.  The cake was so fracken moist which was terrific but the addition of the flavored gelatin--left that 'Jello-yee', factory, processed, 'distinctive Jello-yee' chemical taste.  Whyyyyyy??? Oh whyyyyy? Such a pretty color though and like I said--very, very soft and moist.  I am going to attempt it again (followed recipe exact first time) WITHOUT the gelatin.  See how that works.  That flavored gelatin...just ruins it.  At least for my taste.

I found this cake delicious. I bake a LOT of cakes and i followed the recipe exactly. It follows the script of a basic scratch recips. One thing you MUST do is cream your butter and sugar well. At least 2 minutes to beat air into the batter. This is essential for not having a heavy cake. 
I used fresh strawberries, put a little sugar on them and let then juice up over night. I did not get the the weird artificial taste others were talking about with the jello. I asked everybody that tasted it it they could taste a jello taste. I did add a little red food coloring but just enought to brighten not really color. All and all the cake was flavorful, very light and one that I will be making again.

Reading all the reviews everyone is complaining about density. Someone queried "could it be the gelatin?" Absolutely.  The gelatin does add weight to the layers. Think about the "Jello Cakes" you have made, even though that jello is wet, think about that density. The liquids in the recipe add that density to the jello even though it is added to the remaining ingredients. Be certain to use sifted CAKE flour, you may even want to do a double sift. Don't rush and think just because you haven't any cake flour that you can still get by and have this cake come out fluffy as a cloud. I would also follow others' idea of separating the eggs and whipping the whites into a "meringue" and carefully folding it in the the other ingredients by hand and filling the pans immediately.  One other thing, please, please do yourselves a favor, whatever you chose to frost this cake with, please make it from scratch as well. Your family and guests will praise your efforts believe me! Happy baking.

Wonderful cake! I made three layers (+ two small cupcakes on the side) from this recipe. I made a couple of changes based on others' reviews: 1) used only 1.5 cups sugar 2) beat egg yolks into batter; whipped egg whites to stiff peaks then folded them into the batter. I topped the layers with extra puree and whipped cream cream cheese (from this site - one recipe was large enough to frost between layers, over the cake, and on top of the two cupcakes). Yum! The cake is soft and moist. It's important that CAKE flour (not all purpose flour) be used and that the flour is sifted BEFORE measuring. I highly recommend this recipe and will be making this cake again next week for a birthday. Update: Made this for the birthday. I used silicone pans (no greasing) and made 2 layers instead of three. I prefer the larger layers and the cake was a huge hit. Served it with strawberry puree on the side. Ran out of cake in 5 minutes and had to turn people away!

Ok, I read many of the reviews before picking this recipe and after reading so many at all ends of the spectrum I felt challenged to try it.  I did not add the jello as I didn't want anything artificial in a made from scratch cake.  I did add the egg whites at the very end but did not feel confident about how they didn't seem to get fully icorporated into the batter no matter how much I mixed it.  I baked it for 45 minutes at 350.  I took it out of the oven and it seemed to be done.  I cooled it and made the whipped cream cream cheese frosting found on this site.  I decorated the top with strawberry's and blueberries in a flag pattern since I was taking it to a 4th of July party.  Unfortunately I didn't cut into this cake before going to the party.   I was so embarrased when I my husband brought me the first piece at the party and one look at it told me that something had gone terribly horribly wrong!!  The whole thing was like one big solid lump of glue.  It looked an offish pink color and was just a gelled mass of gunk!! I was so dissappointed and mad!!  The frosting however was fabulous and tasted so yummy.  I would never try this recipe again.  I had put it into a 9X13 pan and I wonder if it was just too much batter for the pan but it also didn't rise despite me sending my husband to the store to buy me fresh baking powder. I don't know what went wrong but it was horrible.  Has anyone else experienced this kind of result?????

Superb!  I've made this cake twice over the last few days; once in 2 9" rounds, and then a 9x13 (baked for 40 min).  It turned out wonderfully both times.  The texture is very nice, not too dense.  I followed some reviewers suggestions; separated eggs and whipped whites to stiff peaks (folded in at end), used buttermilk instead of milk, used 1/2 of the jello mix, cut sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, and used a reduced-calorie strawberry jam instead of the strawberry puree.  Slathered with a cream cheese frosting...awesome!  This one's going to live in my recipe box.  :)

I used this recipe to make cupcakes today, they are perfect! I accidentaly added a little too much strawberry puree and was worried but then I read the reviews and everyone was talking about them being too dense...I guess my mistake was a good one because they turned out soft and fluffy with plenty of yummy strawberry flavor. I love this recipe! Just add about 1/4 cup extra strawberry and it's perfect. :D     (Oh, and p.s. if your making cupcakes bake them for 20 minutes.)

What a delicious cake.  Husband can't get enough of it.  I didn't have any problems at all with the cake other than having to bake it for quite a bit longer than what the recipe said.  Just kept a watchful eye on it.  Added 1 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients to "brighten" the flavors of the cake. 
I used 2 - 9" rounds and trimmed the excess.  
A moist, not too dense cake with a delicate crumb.  Like I said, delicious.  The strawberry flavor comes through very nicely.  
I paired it with White Cake Frosting I from this site and the flavors went well together.  
I use my 6qt stand mixer to make all my cakes and I think that this helps by creaming the butter, sugar, gelatin mixture better so that the cake comes out right.  Using a hand-mixer or trying to beat it by hand may not have your cake come out correctly with this particular recipe.  But that is my lowly opinion.  
Also, like other reviewers have stated - sift then measure.  This makes all the difference!
A keeper recipe for sure.  Look forward to using it again in the future.

This recipe is wonderful, everyone has raved about it! It has become my go to strawberry cake. But it is very important to note that this recipe makes 3 8-inch cakes. If you try to put it in 2 pans, even if they are 9-inch pans, there is not an adequate ratio between batter and room for the cake to rise, which is why some of you are not please with the density of the cake.

strawberry flavored jello doesn't sound like from scratch to me and only using a 1/2 cup of strawberries? I have 1/2 a FLAT to use up.

I was afraid to make this cake because of the inconsistencies in the reviews. In fact, I was set on using a recipe that called for a box cake, but I somehow forgot to get the box cake while grocery shopping.  I'm glad I did. The cake came out moist, fluffy, not nearly as dense as reviews suggested. I did take suggestions of seperating the eggs and whipping and folding the whites in at the very end. I made my puree from 6 large chopped fresh strawberries and a tablespoon of sugar. I also added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to the flour before sifting. I sifted then measured the flour. I was careful not to over-mix. I was paranoid about it deflating so I think I left it in a little longer than necessary. I used 3 9' round cake pans and just greased them with Crisco and floured them like I do all my layer cakes. They came out perfectly. I frosted the cake with a cream cheese frosting recipe from this site, except I subbed strawberry cream cheese for the original and added more powdered sugar. Everyone loved it! I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because of all the alterations I made to the original recipe.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because it does require some adjustments. However, with the adjustments, this recipe produces an amazing, moist, fluffy, and delicious strawberry cake!

1 - Measure the flour AFTER sifting it! It makes a huge difference! Here's what I did: I measured out 2 & 3/4 cups of cake flour & sifted it twice. I then measured 2 & 3/4 cups of the sifted flour to add to the actual cake. If you're really against sifting, lower the flour amount to 2 & 1/4 cup.

2 - Make the puree from fresh strawberries & a pinch of sugar. It's a must!

3 - Separate egg yolks & whites. Add the yolks into the batter when it tells you to "add the eggs." Beat the whites in a clean bowl until they form stiff peaks. Fold this into the batter just before pouring it into pans.

4 - Use salted butter OR add a pinch of salt to the batter if you are using unsalted butter

5 - Just a note: Make SURE that you flour your pans as the recipe tells you to! This helps the cake to "climb" (rise).

I frosted this cake w/ chocolate buttercream per my brother's request. It was amazing! :)

This is an excellent strawberry cake!  After carefully reading reviews, I made the following changes:  (1)  sift the cake flour before you measure it!  to do this, put a measuring cup in a bowl, sift the cake flower over the measuring cup - when you get an overflow of sifted flour, take a knife and run it over the cup to be even (do not pack it!) (2) I used fresh strawberries for the strawberry puree.  to do this, I used about 6 large strawberries, put it in the food processor with about 1.5 tsps of sugar and blended it up.  Was tasty!  (3) As per other reviews, separate the egg whites from the egg yolks.  I wisked them for a few mins and mixed them just until incorporated at the very end.  --  I also used a cream cheese / buttercream icing, and it was so delicious!  The cake was fluffy, definitely strawberry and oh-so-yummy!

If you want the cake to be less dense the only thing you have to do is add a half cup butter instead of 1 cup. Simple. I didn't use the gelatin as I don't eat it and I didn't see the point really unless you want more color and maybe a stronger flavor, but the stronger flavor would be artificial in my eyes and I didn't want that in a homemade cake. I simply used more of the strawberry puree and it gave enough of a flavor so if I wanted to make a strawberry frosting it wouldn't be over powering; I didn't this time, but I will the next time I make it.

After reading many of the reviews, I took the advice plus used an old trick:  let your eggs sit to reach room temperature, then separate and whip the whites until they are frothy before adding....this willl fluff up your batter but I wonder, those who thought it was too dense or did not rise much, are you using cake flour or substituting all purpose??

First things first: this recipe is a pain in the butt to make. However, in the end, in did turn out a delicious cake. 
I followed the recipe, BUT:
I sifted the cake flour BEFORE measuring the amount required (per some reviews). 
I tried to separate the eggs and beat the white separately (again, per some reviews), but that didn't go so well. So, instead I just beat the eggs (whites and yolks together) until a bit frothy, then added them bit by bit to the batter. 
After adding the eggs, I turned off the hand mixer and stirred in remaining ingredients by hand. 
I made a three-layer cake.
I frosted with cream cheese frosting. 
Note: when I first tasted the cake after baking, the texture was a bit grainy--like the gelatin hadn't mixed in well enough. However, after refrigerating overnight (because of the cream cheese frosting), the cake texture was PERFECT. 

Overall, the cake is moist, not too dense (despite some reader reviews), flavorful, and FUN because of the color. If you have enough time to devote to taking your time while making the cake, go for it. You won't be disappointed.

The strawberry gelatin gives this cake an artifical taste. I could have gotten the same from a cake mix without all the extra effort.

I cannot believe how disappointing this was.  I just re-read the ingredients to make sure that I had not gotten them wrong.  While the cake looked lovely, and the consistency was actually very moist and relatively light, the taste was not good!  The cake smelled and tasted like overly sugared kids cereal...like the milk that is left in the bowl after you're done eating Trix.  Perhaps if you cut the sugar in half, and only used a tablespoon of the gelatin for color it would come out better, but as it stands, it was inedible.

I'm always in search of good recipes and I must say that this recipe is a very good one.  I made only a few additions to the cake, in addition to the fact that I made my own cake flour, I added 1 tsp. strawberry extract along with the vanilla and only partially pureed the strawberries leaving some larger pieces.  Also I added 1 - 8 oz. container of strawberry yogurt to the batter.  I made cupcakes with my homemade, strawberry buttercream icing, and I received so many compliments on this cake!! It was moist, full of strawberry flavor and I will definitely be making it again.

I used .30 oz of jello and that was sweet enough.

I took the advice of reviewer naples34102 and added 1T baking powder and 1t salt as well as her filling recipe for the cake- that tasted amazing.

I sifted the flour before measuring and also used three 9" pans, like a lot of users did-  I 100% agree, the cake came out more fluffy and after it was iced, the cake was big and beautiful.

Instead of frozen strawberries, I used fresh strawberries and put them into a pan with a cup of sugar and a splash of vanilla extract over low heat for a little over an hour for a delicious "puree". Don't put the strawberries it a blender to puree after you are done cooking it, your mixer will take care of it.

It was for my mom's birthday and my whole family absolutely loved it and said it tasted like a bakery cake.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. A couple things though: without icing, this cake is already pretty sweet, many seem to agree (I'll reduce sugar next time, not sure how much). I also added 1/4 tsp salt to add complexity. Made sure everything was room temperature. My cake did not fall in the middle. Make sure the sugar and butter are creamed well! Lastly, Whole Foods sells a strawberry gelatin that has no artificial colors or preservatives, so your entire cake can be natural.

I am sorry to say that this was aweful. I made it in two circular cake pans and was pretty mad. The geletan flavor was very dominant and the entire cake had a griney taste. I'm still looking for a good strawberry cake; i suggest you do the same.

One variation: I made my own strawberry puree as I had fresh strawberries on hand. 

Cake came out delicious, fluffy and moist. I sifted my flour THEN measured. Cake was baked in two round pans. I did a light layer of frosting for the center, then used my extra puree as a thin topper to the frosting. Finally, I added very thinly sliced straberries to the frosting/puree mix beford adding the top layer of cake. Once the cake was frosted, I topped it off with more thinly sliced strawberries. It was gorgeous and delicious.

My husband asks for a strawberry cake every year for his birthday. And usually, he gets one from a box-- Not anymore! This was WAY more delicious!

I made this cake for my daughter's 25th birthday.  Not only did everyone say "This cake is really good", but second and third helpings were sliced!  This cake is unique, delectable, and pretty.  I frosted it with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting, found on this site.  I folded the remaining strawberry purée into approzimately one cup of the frosting, and used that as filling between the cake layers.  Aftr reading many of the reviews for the cake, I compiled advice and prepared it with these revisions:  1. make 3 layers, and line pan bottoms with parchment paper; 2. use unsalted butter & add 1/8 teaspoon salt to batter; 3. separate eggs, and beat egg whites until stiff peaks form--fold in as last batter ingredient; 4. measure cake flour after sifting; 5. use 2 teaspoons vanilla.  The layers did not rise much, and the cake was of a more dense nature...but it was so moist and tender and tasty!

Love this cake and the wonderful strawberry flavor it brings.  I followed the recipe, but baked mine in a 9X13 pan instead of 2 layers.  I also used AP flour and adjusted the measurements instead of using cake flour.  This cake was moist and delicious.  I made a strawberry cream cheese frosting that was just perfect for this cake.  Will definitely be making this one again!

This was the recipe I used for my FIRST homemade strawberry cake. I a few reviews before I made it but I just went with what the recipe said. (and like said many times before, sift and then measure your flour, you really have to pay attention to word placement in cases like that.)

 I didn't separate the eggs whites from the yolks and the cake came out fine. The only thing I did differently is use fresh strawberries with a little sugar as appose to frozen strawberries.

The cake tastes great, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good strawberry cake recipe.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday. The cake tasted wonderful, but it didn't rise as I thought it should've. In reading the reviews(which I should've done first), perhaps beating the egg whites seperately would've been key. I topped cake with icing made of cream cheese, coolwhip, powdered sugar, vanilla & left over strawberry puree. Garnished with chocolate covered strawberries. Cake was good enough to give another shot. Thanks for sharing!

Just made this cake and it came out awesome. I was somewhat hesitant about using the jello mix fearing it would give the cake an artificial taste but to my surprise the batter tasted great and had a beautiful pink color. I have important suggestions for preparing this cake. For a less dense and more airy light texture, you must sift the flour first (I used all purpose) then measure out the 2 2/3 cups. Most importantly, you must cream the butter and sugar for at least 5 minutes, longer is better this enables more air bubbles to form aiding in a much more light cake. Good luck and enjoy! Thank you for the person who submitted this recipe...love it!

I made this cake for our Easter dinner.  It turned out terrific.  I made the batter exactly as the recipe directs.  It looked like a lot of batter for two cake pans, so I put it in three pans, and made a tall, beautiful 3-layer cake.  I did my own take on frosting, making a little more than I normally would to accommodate the three layers.  I used 1 1/2 sticks butter, 1 package of cream cheese, enough sweetened strawberry puree to give it a pretty pink color and slight strawberry flavor, and enough powdered sugar to give a stiff frosting (probably 5-6 cups).  The cake is bright pink, and the light pink frosting is perfect for it.

My 86-year old mom wanted a strawberry cake for Easter, and most of them start with white or "strawberry" cake mix, and I try to avoid that for special occasions.  So this recipe was a blessing.  I like to cook naturally, and wish there was some way to avoid the artificially flavored Jello, but I guess you can't get the intense strawberry flavor without that.

Everyone loved the cake.

FYI - use cake flour as directed.  I made this cake once before (years ago) with all purpose flour and it was too dense.  Also, to start, sift the cake flour in a big bowl.  Then carefully spoon it in measuring cups to measure 2 3/4 cups.  If you measure 2 3/4 cups out of the bag, then follow these sifting/measuring directions, you will find that you originally had a lot more than 2 3/4 cups flour.  Again, if you don't do it right, the cake will be too dense.

This is delicious. Especially frosted with a home made strawberry buttercream:) Just threw butter, strawberries and powdered sugar together (oh yeah, and a bit of strawberry preserves). This cake really tasted best chilled for some reason. I do think the frosting is a big part of what made this so amazing though, so this rating is based on the combined end product.

Awesome!!! I get asked to make this cake all the time by family and friends. It is very moist and flavorful, a big hit everywhere I have taken it. I recommend using  FRESH strawberries, smash them with a little Imperial sugar instead of the frozen it calls for. (BIG DIFFERENCE IN TASTE) I do recommend using cream cheese icing II by Janni and refrigerate it until your ready to serve. I hope you love it as mush as my family and friends do!

Absolutely don't see the fetish.  This was my first attempt at a strawberry cake and I did not care for it...couldn't even imagine how to make it better. So I decided to make a cake using a regular recipe and adding pureed strawberries (definitely folded the beaten egg whites)...and that second attempt was awesome!!!

I was really hopeful of this recipe. I read all reviews and decided to make this cake without any changes. I was looking for a good tasting strawberry cake for cupcakes that a client wanted. I tested it on my family first and glad that I did. It was nothing that I expected. It smelled wonderful in the oven and even began to rise nicely then it just went flat. After they cooled I tasted them and it was very rubbery and fake tasting. I am HOPING that I can turn them into cakepops :(

I have been searching for a srwaberry cake recipe for a long time, so when i finally found this (with its high rating and numerous reviews) I just had to try it out. So I followed the instructions step by step, read the reviews and modified some things. I was so excited that this we be a very good cake. But i was actually dissapointed when I cut into the cake and it was so soft that it basically fell apart! I have decided this is because i put too little flour in it. I also tasted the cake and it was a little too sweet for my taste. I am very health concious and Im used to healthy food, so maybe it was just me, but this cake was WAY too sweet.

LOVED this recipe! I made a castle cake for my daughters 3rd birthday and she wanted a strawberry cake. I didn't want to use a box mix and didn't know a recipe for strawberry cake. This worked great for the stacked construction of the cake (held up very well) and was moist and everyone loved the flavor! Will use again, thanks!

I tried to find a scratch recipe and finally found this one. The density of the cake was so heavy and not light at all. I did beat the egg white separately and measured the flour after sifting but it was still to "heavy" tasting and not light and fluffy at all. I will not use it again. I think the recipe needs correcting on some of the measurements. I was very disappointed. I knew everyone else was also since I ended up with over 1/2 of the cake to bring back home. That's never happened to me before!

I wish I could give it 10 stars! THIS WAS AMAZING. It was incredibly moist! It has a nice color. I froze it as soon as it cooled; thawed it the next day and frosted it semi frozen. It presented well; it didn't crumble apart as I tried to frost it and my co-workers complimented me over and over! Definitely a 'keeper'!

I made the cake exactly as written. It fell.  I was going to use this for my son-in-laws birthday tomorrow but I will have to trash it.  I consider myself an excellent baker so I know it is not anything I did wrong.  I believe there is too much liquid, and way too much sugar.  The milk and pureed strawberries makes cake very sticky.  The sugar and jello is just too much sugar.  I should have realized this and made adjustments.  I was going by all the rave reviews.  Live and learn.

Fantastic made-from-scratch strawberry cake!  I made cupcakes, but had some leftover batter, so I made a small cake.  Sounds weird but my cake was dense, while my cupcakes were light and fluffy.  Both were delish, though!  I also sifted the flour and then measured again (you'd be surprised at the difference!) and whipped my egg whites and folded them in at the end.  I used fresh strawberries and think it made all the difference in the world with the flavoring.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.  :)

This is a great cake.  Again, I made some changes and it tasted even better.  I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of almond flavorings added to the puree.  I used unbleached flour and cut it to 2 1/2 cups.  It made the cake lighter.  The crust on this cake is unbelieveable.  Used almond flavoring for the icing.  Try it you'll like it.

I made this cake and found that it tasted wonderful, but I had textural problems, although I followed the recipe carefully (including sifting the flour).  My cake came out very dense, but very moist, with an almost chewy texture to it.  It wasn't necessarily bad, but different, and certainly not what I hoped for.  I will try again, as I have to assume something I did, or didn't do, caused the cake to have that texture, but I can't imagine what I did wrong.

I cut the sugar down and increased the strawberries but it was still way too sweet and artificial tasting. I wanted to like it because it was beautifully colored and smelled good and the crumbs were good. But normal bites were overpoweringly artificial sugary fake non strawberry.

I absolutely LOVE this cake. I did tweak it however and added 1 TBSP oil (for moistness). I also tried it with raspberry jello and raspberries, and I ALWAYS use fresh fruit. It was FANTASTIC!!!!!

YUM YUM.

The cake is a heavy cake but came out great and tasted good. I did cut back the sugar and whipped the egg whites.
I have added this recipe as a faqvorite of ours.

Thank you

I made this cake for a birthday party. I would not recommend using it if you plan on decorating. It is a super moist cake and is hard to get out of the pan. Definitely line your pans with wax paper.

The batter seemed too runny and was breaking. I think more dry ingredients are needed. I was always taught that a good cake recipe has an equal amount of wet and dry ingredients. 

Also add a pinch of salt, the recipe does not include it, and the first batch I made tasted flat.

I found this cake to be fairly mediocre in presentation and taste. Rather than frosting it, I sliced fresh strawberries over it and served with whipped cream as you would a shortcake. The odd pink color was camouflaged in a cloud of whipped cream and berries. The flavor was really enhanced by serving it this way. Thanks.

I loved this recipe but with the modifications as suggested by other reviewers: (1) only used 2 oz of the gelatin powder instead of three (2) DEFINITELY used cake flour and DO NOT substitute all purpose (3) separated egg yolks from whites, beat the whites and added them at the end (4) used real strawberries with some sugar to juice them up (5)used 2 teaspoons of vanilla.

I made this on a Thursday night and served it the following Saturday. It was still so moist and delicious. It was for a child's birthday party and everyone loved it - kids and adults alike. I will definitely make this again but with the mentioned modifications.

This was a good base recipe but as other reviewers have stated, it needs a bit of salt (at least 1/2 tsp).  I cut back on the sugar just a bit to about 1 1/2 cups (since the jello also has sugar in it).   I also subbed 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup 2%milk because I didn't have whole milk on hand.  I think you could easily sub yogurt as well.  I also baked these as cupcakes and adjusted the baking time accordingly.  I'm not usually one to use prepared foods but I did like the color and flavor that the jello added.  So, yes, I made quite a few changes due to ingredients on hand and personal preference but all in all this is still a very good recipe.

Someone explain to me why my cake came out dense.  I read quite a few reviews and did what was suggested ( by the majority).  Egg white last, measure cake flour after sifting.  What happened? The taste was excellent. The one star is because it came out too dense!

I was looking for a strawberry cake recipe for my grand daughters birthday. I was surprise on how moist it was. I made a vanilla buttercream to fill and cover. I will make it again.... everyone loved it.

LOVED this cake. I made it for my birthday as I'm a strawberry fanatic. Only complaint was that it turned out dense, more like a pound cake than a fluffy birthday cake. It was still amazing. I chopped a bunch of fresh strawberries and layered them in between two nine inch rounds along with cream cheese frosting. after the whole thing was frosted with cream cheesy-goodness, I covered it all with sweetened shredded coconut, and decorated the top with fresh strawberries. It looked AMAZING and tasted even better. Next time I'll take into consideration some of the comments and see if it turns out fluffier.

Excellent cake, easy directions!
People that complain about density should just add extra baking powder. I think it was the perfect amount. thank you for sharing!

I just made this cake today, and got the same dense results as other reviewers.  It does taste good, so I really want to like this cake and try to make it better.  My pro-'at home',baker mom said I must've mixed it too long.  Must I sift presifted flour?!

We liked this cake.  As a point of reference, my DH said the cake tasted like strawberry Quik (this was meant as a compliment!).  I spooned the flour into the measuring cups before sifting, and had no heaviness problems.  I just added the eggs as directed, no pre-whipping.  I used pureed fresh strawberries (plenty of sugar in the recipe), and added a little salt too.  I made 24 cupcakes and a small 8" round cake.  I frosted with a not- super-sweet cream cheese frosting.

I had a hard time rating this because I made cupcakes with it and they didn't rise correctly! That has never happened to me before so I reall have no idea why. My oven is awful so that could be it (but I make cupcakes/muffins fairly often so why would it happen to these?). Anyway- the taste was fabulous!! I filled the sunken middles with half a strawberry and covered with homemade vanilla frosting. Yummy! And I think people thought I did the strawberry-middle thing on purpose ;)

I made this exactly as written except for using all-purpose flour instead of cake flour and I used a bundt pan.
Totally delicious! My husband is out of town until tomorrow. He'll be lucky if there's any left when he gets home. lol

Good and moist but only (as stated) measure the flour after you sift, and separate the eggs, whip the whites until fluffy and then gently cut into the batter at the end.  Also, cream cheese or vanilla frosting, I add 1 tablespoon of strawberry jello, 1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts, and 1/2 cup coconut to the frosting to make it more fun.

I am actually currently baking this cake.  I have been doing a trial run for my boyfriend's birthday tuesday.  My first cake came out with very little rise.  I followed others recommendations of cutting the sugar back to 1.5 cups and seperating the egg white and yolks.  I'm not sure seperating the two made much difference as the cake did not rise, but after testing my baking powder to make sure it was still active I added about 1/2 teaspoon more to it.  The 2nd cake has DEFINETLY risen much better, so I would say that if you want your cake to rise just add a bit more baking powder. I'm sure you can follow the rest of the recipe as is, with just cutting down the sugar to 1.5 cups.  Next time I make this cake I will add more strawberry puree.  As for icing, I plan to do a cream cheese/cool whip hybrid of some sort.   Thanks for the recipe!   If you could let us know what fabulous icing you use on it, that would be great!

Whoever said this cake was dense is crazy. Apparently, they think that a homemade cake is supposed to have the texture of a "box" mix.

I used the full amount of sugar, but I didn't use frozen sweetened strawberries (I used fresh) and it was perfect. I also whipped the egg whites and folded them in after everything else was mixed together. It made the best strawberry cake my husband and I have ever had.

I tried this recipe and loved it.  I tweeked it a little bit and the cake came out very light and fluffy.  I added one more egg and used whipping cream instead of whole milk.  Since all stoves are not created equal I had to increase my cooking time to 45n minutes.

Tried this recipe out without making any changes. It tasted sooo good, but was a little sweet. Next time I think I'll omit a bit of the sugar. I used a homemade buttercream icing with it and look forward to making it in the summertime. I think it would be lovely served plain, with fresh strawberries and whipped cream as a new twist on strawberry shortcake!

i looked everywhere online for a good strawberry cake recipe from scratch and this is one of the few i found. i made the recipe exactly like it said except i skipped the strawberry puree (didnt have any at home and didnt want to go to the store). it was wonderful. i did not have any problems with it being to dense or not rising. mine came out exactly like cake should be moist and fluffy but not to the point it was falling apart. i would definitely recommend this recipe.

My new favorite!  I am a caterer and love this recipe!  I use it for my strawberry lemonade cake (filling is lemon curd and fresh strawberry mousse)-it is a favorite with my customers.  Some of the reviews mentioned adding beaten egg whites--this makes it a SPONGE cake and does change the texture--AND one should ALWAYS measure your cake flour and THEN sift it with your b powder--that is probably why some had "runny" batter.  This got copied in my "if I should die" folder so it is DEFINITELY a keeper!!

This was super delicious!!!  My daughter wanted a strawberry cake for her birthday, but being a pastry chef-in-training, I didn't want to make a boxed cake.  This recipe was so simple and turned out fluffy, moist, and delicious.  I have filed it away to make again!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I didn't follow it to a "t" because it was delish!  The only change I made was to puree fresh strawberries (no sugar) and to separate the eggs...egg yolks added one at a time and then beat the whites and added them at the end.  No complaints and no cake left over and I made it for a 2-layer large (12X18) sheet cake!  Used cream cheese frosting in between two layers and frosted with a butter cream frosting.  Very good!

This was a pretty good recipe. The cake came out light and fluffy and was delicious with a cream cheese frosting. Be careful not to open up the oven while they're baking until they're done, or they will fall and get dense, as I learned when I made the first batch (after carefully measuring the sifted flour and beating the egg whites). The only negative about this recipe is that the flavor of the gelatin can be a little abrasive. I think I'm going to try and switch to a recipe that only uses fresh strawberries for flavoring.

This cake is wonderful! I have made it twice and the second time reduced the amount of sugar from 2 cups to 1 1/2. I put stabilized whipped cream and fresh strawberries in between the layers and it's delicious!

Wow, this was a big hit with the family! So moist, light and delicious! The only thing I did slightly different, was I used unsweetened frozen strawberries. Did not add sugar to them, and the cake was perfectly sweet and flavourful. For those who thought it was heavy, I think either they did not sift the flour, or they measured the flour before sifting. It is REALLY IMPORTANT to sift the flour and then measure. Makes a huge difference in the amount of flour you add! I frosted it with vanilla buttercream icing between layers, and a thin layer chocolate buttercream (just added cocoa to the vanilla buttercream) to the top, and cover the whole thing with marshmallow fondant. Fabulous cake!! thaks soo much for sharing!

This was probably the best strawberry cake I have ever had.  I did not tweak the recipe and it turned out fine (as written, you should sift the flour before measuring).  For the folks who had issues with the cake falling: Do not overbeat while mixing.  I used a wooden spoon to mix this one and the texture was perfect!  Served with Rick's Special Buttercream Icing, with fresh sliced strawberries between the layers.  This is a keeper.

I made this cake for a baby shower and it was a huge hit.  The guests had 2 pieces and took a piece home.  The only thing I did different, after the cake was baked I wrapped it up, put it in the freezer and the next day I cut it in half and put strawberry filling in.  I think half the women there asked me for the recipe.

I followed all of the suggestions others made but no one bothered to comment on the baking time.  I forgot that by splitting the batter into 3 pans meant less cooking time. I overcooked mine which is so frustrating after all that time I put into the preparation.  Rookie mistake I guess. I will wake up early and try again tomorrow.

I noticed that a lot of people blamed themselves for messing up the recipe, even though they weren't sure what they did wrong.  I do make a lot of cakes, and was excited to try this recipe.  I took some advice and separated the whites, whipping and folding them in at the end.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla.  I sifted, then measured the flour.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  What I ended up with was a mess.    I set the timer, then left.  25 minutes later, I had a disaster.  The batter in both pans had fallen, and around the edges it had bubbled and even overflowed over the edge of one of the pans.  I went over and over this recipe.  My husband went over it too, asking me questions, etc. (he is a great cook, leaves the baking to me because I am usually good at it).  We couldn't figure out where it went wrong.    I found a similar recipe, and these were the differences: 1.  It called for strawberry preserves, not puree. Preserves are much thicker.   2.  Too much baking powder (2.5t)?  The other recipe was 1.25t powder and 1/2t soda.   3. 3/4c. instead of 1c. butter and 1/2 c. buttermilk instead of 1 c. milk.  I don't know if this is it, but I'm reluctant to try again.  It's a big waste of time and ingredients if it doesn't work out.

I did what the others suggest by separating the eggs and folding the soft peak white eggs at the end.  I forgot to cut down the sugar, but it turned out good.  It is not as sweet as I thought I would be with the original sugar in the recipe.  I used cream cheese icing with slices of strawberries all over the edge and between the layers.

Awesome!!! I tried this recipe for the 1st time and it came out perfect. I read the other reviews and used some of the recommendations.  I used the whipped egg whites (no yokes). Sifted flour before measuring. spread some of the strawberry puree along w/cream cheese frosting between the layers. Pinch of salt to the flour & baking powder mix.  It was very very moist.  More moist than dense.  100% better than a box cake.  The only small problem is that I had a slight indention in the center of the cakes.  I don't know why, because the cake was done.  If anyone can give me advice on how to fix this I will appreciate it.  This cake is worth baking.  simply delicious!!!!

i was searching for a recipe that didn't use cake mix, but the cake was too dense and FLAVORLESS.  it barely tasted like strawberry. i think it is strange that gelatin was used, it was a big hint not to use this recipe.  it has been the worst outcome i have ever gotten.

My daughter wanted strawberry cake for her birthday, she is not a big cake eater and leaves the cake at parties. She ate two pieces of this cake though, that says more than any food critic can ;-)

I probably should have listened to some of the reviewers before I made this. Though the flavor turned out just right, the cake was very dense. 
I presifted the flower, and preblended the egg whites to standing fluffiness, and folded the eggwhite/milk/flour mixture alternatively. Maybe its the gelatin? I rarely see gelatin being used in recipes...

I just baked this cake. I followed the directions to a tee. I'm not thrilled with the outcome. It took 10 minutes longer to cook than stated and the top is almost burned. The taste is very sweet. Too much sugar I think. I will keep looking for a strawberry cake recipe. Thanks anyway!

I made this cake today for Easter Sunday. It looks absolutely delicious! I added about 2/3 C of the puree instead, oh and I also seperated the eggs and beat the whites until they formed stiff peaks. I used 3 nine inch round pans. I made vanilla frosting and added about 1/3 C strawberry puree. :D

Okay so here's my update. I just got back from my family's house...my cake was a hit! It was absolutly delicious! This is a keeper :D

I wanted to make a from-scratch strawberry cake for my daughter's birthday party and I found this one.  I tried it out two weeks before and it was pretty good.  Though there's a lot of sugar this cake wasn't eccessively sweet--just rich.  It's very thick and heavy; and you have to flour the pan well so it won't stick.

Simply the BEST strawberry cake I've ever had.  I've never been a huge fan of strawberry cake, but I made this for a special occassion, and it was right on the mark!!  It had a wonderful strawberry flavor and I used cream cheese frosting from scratch too.  Absolutely nothing compared to boring box mixes.  Well worth the extra effort.  Can't wait to make it again!!

The best strawberry cake I've tried... although I did some doctoring of my own, and will probably be posting that recipe in a short while. 

I didn't change the batter one bit, with the exception of making my own sugared strawberries and pureeing those. I also followed the suggestion from another review and separated my eggs, and folded in the stiff whites at the end. I must note that the author apparently has some deep cake pans, because it took three 9" pans to do the job. 

What I did change though was the icing... I have my own strawberry butter cream icing that I prefer, and make just as you would any standard butter cream icing except I use the strawberry cream cheese instead of plain, and add and 1 TBSP strawberry preserves. 

For the bottom and middle layers, I used 1/2 a container of the strawberry cream cheese and a small jar of Harry & David wild strawberry preserves - beat those together until they were smooth, and spread a thin layer atop the bottom and middle layer... iced the top and sides with the butter cream icing.

This recipe definitely isn't diabetic-friendly but it's been requested at the office and family gatherings since I tried it the first time for a co-worker's birthday. 

Hope this review helps.

The cake was a bit too sweet. 2 cups of sugar, Jell-o and sweetened strawberries is a lot of sugar. I would cut down on the sugar, probably up to 1 cup. Definitly use a chocolate glaze. (1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 2 tbsp. butter & 1 tbsp. corn syrup, melt and pour the glaze over the still warm cake.

This review is for Benc: I feel for ya honey.  Here is what I "think" went wrong for you.  Once you begin to very, VERY gently fold in your egg whites with a rubber spatula, bone dry (the spatula) you must stop after folding just about 3 or 5 turns.  It will NEVER look incorporated, the whole idea of beating the egg white separately, which must also be done with clean and bone dry beaters!!!! Is to give the cake "lift" if you try to over incorporate, the whole thing will fall flat.  OOPS, but it's happened to us all, so don't beat yourself up.   Beating and folding in egg whites is a tricky thing and it's best if you can watch a professional video of it being done if you are a first timer.  I was and had the same trouble some years back, my dear.

I'm not sure what I did wrong with this recipe, but it didn't rise in the center. I've made many cakes, and I made a white cake a couple hours before making this one that has basically the same composition and it turned out fine, this recipe just a few differences in the quantity of ingredients. The other rose and was moist and delicious, and this one is concave in the center. Also, the gelatin gives it a very fake strawberry taste, you may as well use a box mix.

I love this recipe! After reading some other reviews about the cake being too dense, I decided to purchase enough ingredients to make it a few times. (I was planning to use it for a friend's birthday so I wanted it to be perfect.) When I followed the original instructions, my cake did turn out to be tasty, but very heavy and not exactly what I would have liked. So the second time I made it, I added the vanilla and strawberry puree BEFORE adding the eggs, and whipped the batter on high speed for an extra thirty seconds after adding the last egg. My second cake was much lighter, and exactly what I was looking for. Definitely a crowd pleaser :)

I made this cake TWICE in 2 days. I made it for my son who specifically requested a strawberry cake for his birthday. I've never been that great at cake making, they always seem to come out too dense and dry. I guess I don't pick the right recipes. So with this one, I read all the reviews first and decided not to make it per the instructions and go with the reviews. I separated the eggs and beat the whites, I reduced the sugar and the flour and only used 3 eggs.  The cake tasted really good, but it was the texture of dense bread! It was gross! Cake to me is supposed to be fluffy as air. Not a muffin or bread. I could tell by the batter that it was going to be dense, it was too gooey and thick..even after the egg white were stirred in. The cake ended up in the garbage. So today I made it again EXACTLY as the recipe states. I made sure the butter, milk and eggs were all room temperature. As with all baking, this is an extremely important step. I beat the butter and sugar till it was really fluffy. The addition of the eggs made it even more fluffy. Make sure strawberries are defrosted before blending. Strain seeds. I poured the batter into 2 9" rounds.  It fit just fine. The cakes rose above the sides of the pan and when cooled, it shrunk just to the top of the pan, nice fat cakes! I had to cook them 5 mins longer than stated. 
I iced with buttercream frosting. The first slice to come out was PERFECT and I jumped for joy. MAKE THE CAKE AS INSTRUCTIONS STATE! You won't be sorry.

The recipe and the cake are delicious.. Some hints.. Make sure you cook the puree so that its thick and not much liquid otherwise it may make the dough too runny.. Let the cake cool at least 20 minutes before removing from pan otherwise it will fall apart. You may need to run a knife on the edges to loosen in case it has cooked to the side. Works well in charecter pans and fills in nicely. Thanks for sharing.

My cakes baked up nicely and were moist with a pound cake like texture. The only problem I had was that it seemed to be lacking in strawberry flavor. This defeated the purpose of baking a strawberry cake. I followed directions exactly as written.  Might try again with a strawberry reduction made with fresh strawberries.

I rarely write reviews but this cake recipe was very good with a few changes. I used some of the suggestions that were posted and my cake didn't turn out dense or too sweet.  The changes I made: 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening instead, 1/4 cup Strawberry Jello instead of the whole package (I think I'll try it with less Jello next time and more strawberry puree), 1-1/2 cups sugar, and only 3 eggs (I didn't even separate them). Thanks! It made a great Valentine's Day cake for my husband and 2 sons.  They really enjoyed it.

The batter looked promising, but it took twice as long to look and feel (toothpick test) baked, and then when I cut into it, it was a disaster- mushy and inedible. Will not be making again.

I made this cake for my daughters 9th birthday and it was fantastic!  The only thing I did differently was that I used frozen unsweetened strawberries instead of the sweetened ones.  It was a huge hit!  I will make it again.

This cake has a great flavor, but i have had issues with this cake being heavy and not rising properly...perhaps i'm overmixing where as others don't mix long enough???

I made this into cupcakes for my grandson's birthday party and even though they didn't rise well, topped them with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting also from this site and they went like hot cakes...

I was asked to make a strawberry cake for a special event.  I made 2 test cakes:  #1 as written and #2 according to the reviews using egg whites only and folding them in last.  I thought this cake was good but I had everyone at work compare a test cake from this recipe (dense texture, rich flavor) to a strawberry box cake (light, fluffy, thin flavor) and vote for which they liked best.  I made a vanilla frosting.  One liked the #1 cake, four liked the #2 cake, and five chose the box cake.  I think most people have become used to the taste of a box cake and think that is good.  For the ease of making a large cake for this occasion I'll just use the box cake and save this recipe for my own use.  Added note:  I tried this recipe in a 9x13 pan and it took forever for the center to cook.

Very nice recipe, but I did as others suggested and separated the eggs and whipped the yolks and folded them in at the end... Be sure to measure your flour after you sift it or you will be sorry... I also used fresh strawberries and made my own puree... I used my own strawberry cream cheese frosting with just a hint of pureed strawberries... This cake received rave reviews 2 strawberry cake lovers... its a keeper (with the modifications of course)

This is the best strawberry cake recipe ever!  I made the cake as directed and didn't make any changes.  After 3 days, it was still very moist.  I topped it w/ the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  I will be making this again and again.

2011 - Came out too dense. I followed the directions.. and yes, I measured sifted cake flour. Not sure.

2015 - Update: My husband made me this cake for my birthday! (he didn't know I had used this recipe before) It was so sweet. His cake came out exactly like I remembered mine. I still thought it was just too dense, It wasn't very pleasing... of course I didn't let him know that!

Super yummy. Dense even after whipped egg whites and added at end. Made cup cakes and cooked about 23 minutes at 350. I'll make again. They were a hit!

Wow! My Mom in Law requested a strawberry cake for her bday...and after searching for the perfect recipe...I found this one! The cake was a HIT!!! Everyone raved about it for each and every bite. And I made the most unbelievable frosting with it. Follow the buttercream frosting recipe on the back of the powdered sugar box, and add about 1/2 cup strawberry puree at the end....unreal!! DELICIOUS RECIPE!!!

I followed the recipe except that I upped the baking powder to 4 tsps, and I whipped the egg whites.  Thank goodness I did as the cake barely rose properly.  There was no excess to cut off the top.  If you do not like jello, you will hate this cake.  It made my house reek of strawberry jello for days.  I would not lessen the amount of sugar as others have said.  The cake already wasn't sweet enough for me.  This is the only cake my family has ever tasted and refused to eat. The gelatin made it taste nasty.

I used 2 cups of strawberries instead of the 1/2 cup. I started to sift the flour to measure, but I got impatient so I measured it out from the container and put it in the kitchenaid. I also just threw the eggs in one at a time as recipe called for, and it was super moist and fluffy. I don't think you need to do the extra work if you have a good mixer. Making this again tomorrow to bring to a friends for supper. However, I found buttercream icing too sweet with this cake. May try cream cheese with the next one. Give this a try, you won't be dissapointed.

This is one of my first cakes from scratch and it tasted delicious.  It makes a ton of batter so a three tier cake (9inch rounds) is suggested. I put sliced strawberries and strawberry puree in the middle and covered it in "Dorothy's special buttercream." I also followed all the suggestions (sift flower, separate eggs, etc...) Yum!

Super cake! followed reviewers, made my puree from scratch, used fresh strawberries, 2 cups, 2 tsp of sugar and 1 tablespoon of water, strained for seeds and used it in both the cake and the frosting, which I made just a classic butter cream with the puree in it. Cake was wonderful. My husband cant stop ranting about this cake. we officially have a new fave! I made it three layers an added the whites last and the cake was super light and fluffy!

This recipe was good, but the strawberry taste was too "artificial" I think b/c of the jello.  I used sugar-free jello and it turned out much better!

On reading it, I thought the recipe had too much sugar but it was perfect - although I used unsweetened pureed fresh strawberries. Really good texture and flavour. It needed a bit of pink food colouring to make it as pink as the picture. This recipe worked well for cupcakes and big cakes. I used light milk because it's what I had in the fridge.

Awesome recipe! I was worried with some of the reviews of it being dense but I did not experience that at all.  Mine was light and fluffy! I did separate the egg whites and yolks and beat the egg whites until they were light and fluffy.  Flavor was great as well and I received compliments on the taste.  I frosted with a buttercream and it was wonderful.

Great recipe!  I made it for a strawberry loving co-worker.  A cake with heft and substance without being dry at all.  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting flavored with a little of my leftover strawberry puree.   This is definitely a keeper!

I made this for an office birthday party and it met rave reviews.  I used fresh strawberries to puree for the cake and made a cream cheese frosting to which I added more pureed fresh strawberries and folded in some whip cream.  Garnished it with sliced fresh strawberries on top.  I did follow the suggestion of some other reviewers and separate the eggs.  I also baked as a sheet cake rather than layers.  I thought the texture had just the right balance, and since there was not a single crumb of it left long before the workday ended, I'm going to guess that those who ate it didn't have a problem with the texture either.  :-)  Thanks for sharing!

I just made this cake for my son's 3rd birthday - it was AMAZING! Perfect in every way - very moist, perfect density, great flavor. Baking is a hobby of mine, and I do it very often - this is the best strawberry cake I've ever made - or had. *I did sift the cake flour before measuring, as others had mentioned.

This is a dense cake.  I only used 1 cup sugar, 2 is just too much.  I baked it in a bunt pan but I think this recipe would make better muffins than cake.  I would suggest using more than 1/2 cup of the puree.

The cake was AMAZING! I agree with other reviewers in that it was heavy, but that was just fine for me. I pureed some strawberries and found that I had a lot more than 1/2 cup . . . I couldn't let that go to waste, so once I poured the batter into my 13x9, I swirled the remaining puree into the batter. It had to bake a bit longer prepared this way, but boy was it worth it. I topped it off with a sweetened whipped cream topping and sliced strawberries. It was a huge hit.

Fantastic summer cake! Have tons of strawberries from my garden. Used fresh ones as a decoration and jam for the filling between layers.  Had frozen berries from the garden.  Huge differrence  in flavor w/ thefresh fruit. Beat the egg whites separately for a super light moist cake. I had enough batter for a 3 layer cake and the presentation was spectacular with fanned whole berries and a jam drizzle in the center. Many oohs and ahhhs from the family.

I thought this was very good! I, too, added the yolks in alone and whipped the whites until soft peaks formed. After adding all the ingredients together, including the strawberry puree, I folded in the whites. It baked up perfectly- and I used a buttercream frosting made up of 1 stick softened unsalted butter, 1 8z package of cream cheese, 1 Tbsp pure vanilla extract and 1lb of confectioners sugar. Came out great and my husband raved about it! It didn't last long!!

First time making this cake, and it came out AwEsOmE!! Followed the recipe to the T, took suggestions from other reviewers and sifted the flour first, and beat the egg whites and added them last. The cake LOOKED dense in appearance, but was definitely moist and super yummy. I made this as others suggested with the sturdy whipped cream frosting. It was definitely killer, and I got the "nom nom nom" award :)

Wow.  This was one of the best cakes I've ever made and eaten!  I followed the recipe to a T and I followed what other reviews said to do:  I sifted the flour and I separated the eggs.  I also used real strawberries and smashed them with a fork (instead of the frozen).  I made homemade cream cheese frosting and I cut strawberries up and placed them on top of the cake for decoration.  Very very delicious and I got rave reviews on it with everyone that ate it!  Thank you so much!!

I made this cake for my daughter's 6th birthday party and man was it a HIT! Everyone wanted the recipe and it didn't last! So good! Only thing I changed was I used fresh strawberries for the puree and didn't add any sugar to them. I iced it with the Cool Whipped Frosting by GothicGirl.

i made a raspberry version of the cake (using frozen raspberries to puree and raspberry jello powder) and it was great! multiplied everything by 1 and a half and it was perfect for my 2 layer heart shaped cake for my host mom on mothers day. I decorated with vanilla frosting and between the two layers i had one layer of frosting and also one layer of puree from the left over berries. It was gone in a flash! 4 stars only because it was a little dense, and besides changing the berry, i followed the recipe to the letter

Delicious! Everyone loved this cake. I used a recipe for cream cheese filling and used strawberry flavored cream cheese for the middle filling, and then iced with buttercream frosting. Yum!

Not sure why this cake did not turn out.  It tasted like dough, that smelled like strawbery jello.  It was very dense, all 3 of my children including myself were very disappointed.  I even covered in a chocolate ganache and filled it with a chocolate mousse.   Sorry, but I will not be using this recipe again.

followed recipe except separated eggs and whipped egg whites.   whipped egg white were folded in last.  cut sugar to about 1 3/4 c.  used 3 pans.    i was looking for a pink birthday cake for a three year old party.  i made this cake as a practice birthday cake. i didn't want to use a cake mix and wanted to see how this recipe fared.  i wanted to like this cake but felt a little iffy due to the large number of highly variable reviews.    cake was dense.  it tasted ok.  a little on sweet side.  as a layer cake, it was ok but still dense.  the cake itself is ok.  considering it doesn't have that many  nutritional qualities, i would probably not make this again.  however, i didn't give it 1 or 2 stars because i don't agree that this was terrible.  the jello didn't add too terrible of a flavor.    if you do use this recipe, you have to use a dense frosting.  the lighter whipped frostings will just smoosh out.  also, most of the frostings on this website are too sweet for this cake.  you would likely be best off with a cream cheese frosting with very very minimal sugar.

i have edited my review.  i have finally found a real strawberry cake recipe that came out perfect and made me realize how awful this cake recipe was.

This cake was super good, but sooooo sweet! Make sure to use a frosting like whipped topping that isn't really sweet as well. Otherwise this cake was moist and delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wow. Maybe I did something wrong with this cake because it wasn't soft and moist like most other people.  It was quite dense and did not rise.  I took the advice of others to use buttermilk and add in whipped egg whites at the end but the end result was not good =(.  I will not be trying this again.  Strange enough, everyone else liked it....  Made it for my sister's birthday too because she's a strawberry lover, but I was embarrassed >_

This may be the best cake I've ever made. I did a couple of things different.  I used buttermilk in place of regular milk. It's strawberry season here so I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen.  I made a fresh strawberry filling for the cake and I used the frosting recipe from here to frost it.  It's the cream cheese/whipped cream frosting.  Wow is it ever good and the cake is so beautiful I had to take pictures of it.

This cake has a nice colour and texture, but the flavour is good *only* if you like artificial strawberry flavour, like that found in ice cream, jello, and milkshakes. My son liked this cake, but my husband and I thought it just ok. I added almond extract, which helped. Frosted with cream cheese.

i love this recipe, as a beginner in baking, it inspires me a lot, the first time that i saw this recipe, photos and reviews, all i can say was... "mouth watering", the previous reviews helps a lot, for giving ideas specially the frosting, by the way i used strawberries in can, but i think it would be better to use the fresh once, but unfortunately its not a strawberry season.
i used a mixed of  whip cream and strawberry puree for filling/layering, and cream cheese for frosting. YUM!

I made this for my husband for Valentine's day.  He loved it!  I followed advice of another reviewer and beat the 4 egg whites separately until stiff peaks formed then folded them into the batter, along with 4 egg yolks. It helped make the cake really moist and it didn't cave in the middle after baking.  I also used a jar of strawberry preserves as a filling between the 2 cake layers, and cream cheese frosting on top.  Yummy!

It is 2007 Valentine's Day evening, and I just made this cake as directed...

The moist delicious taste deserves 5 stars- but this cake sunk in middle, then fell into pieces on the cooling rack. I went into high-speed Martha Stewart mode to think of a way to revive the disaster.

I molded the broken pieces together, patted into 3/4 inch rounds, then grabbed my heart shaped cookie cutter. I was able to assemble six 2-layer heart-shaped cakes from one of the layers. I used cream cheese frosting to hold together. And with the extra frosting, I was able to pipe on the caketops: "i love u".

Not sure if I'll make this again - depends upon my husband's response...

WOW! Very good!!! I made this with separating the eggs and whipping the whites to soft peaks before folding them in at the very end. This cake is very moist! You don't even need frosting, it's so good by itself. I use this for birthday cakes and have even made cupcakes with it.

This is a great cake-from-scratch recipe for any flavor. Just replace the strawberry gelatin and strawberries with any other (fruit or chocolate) flavor. Came out great! Will use as a base for other flavored cakes as well. Thanks for posting!

Cake was moist but dense and heavy. Great taste but it didn't have the light airy texture I was expecting. I don't think I'll make this again. UPDATE: I tried this recipe again. This time, I beat the butter mixture a lot longer, used buttermilk, and used cake flour instead of A.P. I also used fresh-picked strawberries I got from the local farmer's market instead of store bought. The cake turned out very moist and less dense than the first attempt and not at all heavy. I topped it with strawberry cream cheese frosting and sold it by the piece at a bake sale. It went fast. Good thing I kept a piece at home for myself. This recipe deserves at least one more star.

This cake taste great and I always get request to make it. The only thing I don't like about it is the texture. It is very sticky and can be difficult to frost. I recommend using parchment paper to line the bottom of your pan and freezing the cake before frosting.

Awesome cake! I made this for my daughter's fourth birthday party, and kids and adults alike couldn't get enough. Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out fantastic! It was gone so fast I should've made two. My dad wants me to make it for his wedding now. ^^

This is entirely too sweet, so much so that I couldn't frost it. Adding the jell-o which is sweetened with 2 cups of sugar is just too much. Even before I added the puree, I tasted the batter and sugar rush. If I make this again, I will cut out 3/4 cups of tue white sugar.

This recipe was so good, one of the best cake recipes I've found so far.  I made a few changes but nothing major.  Being a beginner with baking from scratch I've read that some people use pudding mix in their cakes and it helps make it moist.  So I used a box of strawberry cream pudding mix that was sitting in my cabinet for months instead of buying jello mix.  I also used fresh strawberries instead of frozen.  It came out delicious and was gone by that night.  It was a really fluffy and moist cake.  Thanks!

Made these into cupcakes (24 big ones).  Followed the recipe to a T except for separating eggs, beating whites, and folding in at the end.  The result, a divine, fluffy, delicious cupcake topped with cream cheese icing and a chocolate dipped strawberry.  So ridiculously good.

The original cake was a bit dense.  here is what helped the 2nd time i made it.  1. Use 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c butter flavored crisco instead of 1 c butter. 2. use cake flour, and use sifted flour for your measurement. (if you don't have cake flour remove 2 Tbps flour per cup and replace with 2 Tbps cornstarch) 3. beat the egg whites until peaks then fold into the batter.  With the changes, it was a 5 star recipe for me.  but the original i give 4.  good luck!

I made this cake today to use up some strawberries that I had. I didn't have whole milk so I made some butter milk to use instead. I then realized I didn't have any strawberry jello powder so I used raspberry instead. I cut the sugar to 1 3/4 cups but kept everything else the same. I read almost all of the reviews and was a little hesitant to try it but what the heck, let's go for it. Well, I decided to bake it in a bundt pan and baked it for 50 mins. It rose beautifully and smelled awesome. After removing from the pan when cool, this was easy too, I mixed some of the puree with some cream cheese and icing sugar. It turned out great, beautiful colour and texture, not dense at all. I did make sure to thoroughly cream the butter, sugar and jello powder so it wouldn't be grainy. I didn't separate the eggs either, just added when called for. I used my immersion blender to create the puree. Didn't bother putting it through the strainer. Worked great. I've added some pics if anyone is interested in seeing how it came out. I doubt it is going to last long. Everyone loves it.!!!! For those of you who thought it tasted artificial, I recommend not to use sugar free jello, it has chemical sweetners in it.

My first cake from scratch, and it came out amazing! Followed suggestions to sift then measure flour, separate the egg whites, beat, and 3-9 in cake pans. Made my own strawberry puree, used in cake and in between layers with cream cheese icing. Came out perfect!

I did like the taste of this cake, but it was very dense.  I also had a real problem with the baking time.  I don't blame the recipe for that, though, as I was attempting to make this in a Pyrex bowl for a Princess Barbie Cake.  I figured that I should double the baking time.  At that point it was still not done, so I added an additional 15 minutes and the top was getting quite dark and crispy looking, so I pulled it out of the oven as it did spring back when touched.  I let cool 15 minutes then tried to take it out of the bowl.  Oh my!  The entire thing collapsed - it was still completely raw in the middle!  It made a heck of a mess.  The color was nice and the outside 1/2" or so that was done tasted good.  I had to throw it all away, obviously, and I made another cake using a different recipe that came out fine.   I might try this again but make it in the "normal" pans to see how it comes out.

Love this recipe!  I make cakes on the side but didn't have a good strawberry cake recipe.  I tried this one for cupcakes for a birthday party two weeks ago, and have had 4 orders since.  I'm making 5 dozen tonight for 2 parties this weekend.  Delicious flavor, nice crumb.  Great with my cream cheese icing! It's a little sticky on the outside, I recommend freezing for a bit before adding the crumb coat if you're decorating a cake. For those who had trouble with this recipe:  it makes a BIG difference if you use name brand ingredients (yes, it really does change the flavor), use superfine sugar (I don't mean powdered) if you can find it, and make sure all your ingredients are room temperature. And follow the recipe exactly.  Taking things out of order, like adding the eggs at the end, change the result.  You're building a chemical reaction that will make the cake bake just so, adding ingredients out of order interrupts the process.  BTW, I did not add or take away anything from this recipe at any time.  Great every time.

This was a beautiful and tasty cake.  I used the entire box of gelatin but didn't use frozen sweetened strawberries- mine were not sweetened.  I found the sweetness level was perfect for me and I don't like overly sweet cakes.  I added the strawberry puree in with the milk rather than adding it in at the end.  Yes the cake layers were dense but it didn't detract from the taste of this cake.  I baked mine in 3 9 inch cake pans instead of 2.

Excellent recipe! I followed other reviewers advice and used 2 3/4 cups of PRE-sifted flour. I also seperated the egg whites from the yolks and whipped them to soft peaks then folded them in at the end of the batter process. It was perftectly moist and fluffy! 
I did use three 9" round cake pans instead of 2, and sprayed them with nonstick floured baking spray which worked great. I cheated and used store bought whipped cream cheese icing but made it my own by blending some of the leftover strawberry puree into it. 
For in between the cake layers I used the frosting and also drizzled more of the strawberry puree on. Wow did it turn out delicious and not overly sweet either. Definitely a keeper!

Very easy, very tasty recipe. Good flavor, moist and I didn't find any issue with the density.  Until recently, I had been lazy using boxed mixes. Taking a cake decorating class gave me the opportunity to experiment with scratch cake recipes. This was a definite keeper. Just as another review said, definitely beats a mix.

I searched high and low for a scratch strawberry cake recipe for my daughters birthday. This was perfect as written.  I had to use all-purpose flour instead of cake flour because there wasn't any in my store. I'll be making this again.

LOVE this cake and everyone who has eaten it absolutely LOVED it too! I was asked for the recipe many times. I follow the recipe exactly, but instead of cake flour I use AP flour. It comes out more dense than a white cake, but it is also moister, richer and better tasting than any box cake.  I use buttercream icing only and mix some pureed strawberries in the icing as well.  I have only made it with fresh strawberries so far that I have pureed with a fork (no blender needed) and one TB of sugar.  For the icing, I just add about 1/3 cup of strawberry puree and cover each layer. It comes out awesomely tasting. Can't wait to make another one tomorrow.

This is a very good recipe, I madde it last year at Easter and this year too. I do tweak this recipe a little. I use 3 9 inch pans instead of two. I also make extra strawberry puree to put in between the layers while the cake is hot, poking small wholes so the puree seeps in. I frost with cream cheese frosting and decorate with fresh strawberries.

it was really good, but i was kinda disappointed in how much it tasted like a box cake mix.  I didn't want there to be any confusion in the fact that it was from scratch, and I didn't get that feeling from this cake.  good though!

You will not find a better recipe, don't even try. This is a little more dense than a box cake. The flavor is great and it's not an all day process to make. I've made this for my teenage son three years in a row now for his birthday. He doesn't want anything else. GothicGirl rocks! Thanks for sharing.

One of the best desserts I have ever consumed.  I used half vanilla pudding and half strawberry Jello and cut the vanilla amount in half.  It was so moist and delicious.  I used a cream cheese frosting recipe from here on the site and it seemed to be the perfect match for this cake.  Highly recommended!

Wonderful cake & is my go to recipe for Strawberry Cake. I didn't have to separate the eggs, but I did cream the first 4 ingredients until very light and fluffy, I also made sure everything was at least room temperature (& softened the butter in the microwave) so that all are incorporated well. I baked the cake in a 325 degree oven with a pan of hot water on the lower rack.

for taste, i give this recipe 5 stars, but when handling the baked cake i found it hard to work with... it could have fallen apart easily. maybe i over mixed the batter. I made it as a mothers day cake with cooked meringue icing- everyone loved it :D

I made this for the 4th of July this year.
EVERYONE loved this cake. I to like to make things from scratch but i went ahead and used the Jello mix. I had to make sure that my daughters mom in law got a copy of this recipe. I didnt fold in the egg whites at the end but added them as the recipe called for for whole eggs. I didnt add a whole tablespoon of vannilla but 2 teaspoons and i didnt sweeten the strawberries. This cake does look very wet but just keep testing it with the old tried and true toothpick in the center for doneness.

This was so good.Since i didn't have any cake flour at hand i made my own cake flour by sifting all purpose flour then i measured 1 cup from sifted flour then i removed 2 Tbsp siftd allpurpose flour and then i added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to make 1 cup cake four.I use also extra vergin olive oil instead of butter.i lessen the sugar to 1 1/2cups and still taste good specially coz i made a vanilla strawberry frosting..i will make this again nxt tym.Thanks for sharing...and one more to make the cake fluffy and moist when its baked do not open the oven immediately leave 1st in th oven for a minute then slowly open the oven to introduce the cold air to the cake-inorder not to make the cake dense

LOVED this cake.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I changed some of the ingredients.  I don't have gelatin so I added an extra 1/3 C fresh pureed strawberries instead.  VERY MOIST cake.  I also used unsweetened coconut milk (does not change the flavor) in place of the whole milk.

I wanted a strawberry whip creme frosting but I had no whip creme or heavy creme so I frosted it with a creme cheese frosting where I added some of the strawberry puree and the whole thing was a hit.

Loved this recipe I followed the suggestions of measuring the "shifted" flour and floding in the egg whites@ the end ..... only thing I did wrong and totaly my mistake I didn't realize it said cake flour until I started cooking so I used all purpose flour(I also shifted abt 2 times after I measured).......the cake came out great a little dense but every1 loved it i saw a review after I was done that said u can add corn starch to the all purpose flour dnt knw if that works or not . But this cake was great.... also I used a store brought cream cheese frosting and added some fresh strawberry pruee to it delious

My daughters and I made this on a rainy day after watching recorded shows of Cake Boss. We had a craving for cake, and my oh my this was a really good cake! We didn't have strawberry gelatin, but used raspberry and kept everything else the same. What a great cake and so different from the traditional vanilla, marble, or chocolate. We loved every crumb of it!

The cake was pretty good.  My hubby loved it, but for me, a little more dense than I intended and I followed all tips (separate eggs, line pans w/parchment paper).  It was moist, but a little heavy.  Also it was not as strawberry-y as I would have liked.  I will make it again in a few weeks for my son's birthday, maybe add a little more puree, some food color (it was light pink), and poke holes while still hot and pour another pack of gelatin dissolved in hot water over the top.  I'll keep my icing (3/4 pack cream cheese blended w/ confectioners sugar, added to a large tub of copol whip) , and could never forget to add fresh strawberries to the finished product!

I was really, really excited about this cake. It smelled divine as I was making it... I divided the recipe in half because I wanted only one nine inch pan worth of cake--but it made enough for a nine inch plus a dozen cupcakes. Instead of cake flour I went with the 3/4 cup plus 2 T all-purpose flour + 2 T cornstarch = cake flour rule. I warmed up some frozen sweetened strawberries in the microwave and pureed them to make the strawberry puree. I followed the instructions exactly...but when my cake came out of the oven the middle had seriously sunk in. After waiting ten minutes after taking it out of the oven and flipping it upside down to take it out of the pan, the cake then depressed the other way...I will continue my review after trying the cake.

OMG this cake was awesome.. I didn't change anything except that I made a fresh strawberry puree. I doubled the recipe to make a sheet cake and cupcakes. I searched and searched for a good strawberry cake from scratch and this is soooo going into my cake rotation lol. I have never been a fan of strawberry but this one really changed my mind. Thank god for cake requests or I would have never tried it.

This tasted okay. I was kind of disappointed. I wanted a melt in your mouth light and fluffy strawberry cake. Instead what I got was a thick dense cake. It tasted like a strawberry flavored pound cake only more dense and thick. Also I used a 9/13 inch glass baking dish. It took 50 minutes to bake this in the oven which is twice as long as what it said to bake it for. I have a nice whirlpool gold oven that works great so it wasn't anything to do with my oven. I won't make this again.

Made this cake & followed the recipe. it turned out light & delicious!  I make my puree from fresh strawberry's to which i added sugar to them during cooking. I ended up with a cup of puree.  I brushed my left over 1/2 cup of puree on the layers of cake it gave the cake extra moistness & extra fruit flavor. I will soooo make this again!!

This cake was moist and flavorful.  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I followed the instructions of other reviewers and separated the eggs add the yolks initially and stiffly beat whites folding them in at the end.  I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! I made a few substitutions because I didn't have butter (used vegetable oil instead) and only had 3 eggs. I also used less than half of the recommended sugar, and it still came out very sweet. Everyone that had a piece wanted more!

Dense and delicious! I decided my round cake pand weren't quite big enough so I made 3 layers instead of two. I frosted the inside and out with sweeetened whipped cream (with an added stabilizer) and poured chocolate ganache over top. Very filling and very good!

I made this cake on 04/08/2011.  I loved it about 3 and a half stars.  I think this recipe was really good but if you have a recipe this good you have to give direction on a glaze.  I made this with a home made vanilla confection glade.  I don't think canned frosting or a heavy frosting would go well with this cake.  The vanilla confection glaze was light enough to compliment without over powering the flavor of the cake.  try it and enjoy.

I made this cake once with the suggested changes i.e. separting the eggs and whipping the egg whites and then adding and I made it once the regular way with just adding 3 teaspoons of baking soda.  The second way was more successful with getting a nice fluffy cake.  The extra work of whipping the egg whites is not worth the effort.  I did however, sift the flour and re-measure each time.  Overall a very nice tasting cake.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for my husband's birthday and followed the directions exactly as written.  Everyone really liked it; however, I agree with several other reviewers that the gelatin gave it an odd aftertaste.  I think I'll try it again without the gelatin and more of the pureed strawberries.

This cake was the BEST strawberry cake ever!!! I had to make a large sheet cake so I had to triple the recipe. I did leave about a 1/2 C - 1 C of sugar out, just so it wouldn't be too sweet. It turned out great! It was the talk of the baby shower! Everyone was raving about how it was the best cake they every had! This is my go to strawberry cake recipe now!!

This cake is phenomenal!  I increased the strawberrys and used 1 1/2 cups fresh chopped strawberries that I let sit in 1/4 sugar for a half hour before using.  I also only used 3 eggs because that's all I had on hand at the time.  Still, it turned out well and the taste is heavenly.  I used a cream cheese frosting: 1 cup whipped cream cheese 4 Tbl. softened butter and 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar.  I highly recommend this recipe.

A disappointment. I followed the instructions exactly and the final batter was in fact pink-looking. But when it came out of the oven it had become a brown color. I also sifted the flour before measuring and beat the egg whites and yolks separately - all to get a lighter texture. But NO - it came out brown-looking and the height of the cake in the oven 'regressed' on cooling so it was the same height as the batter that I put into the pan. The texture was quite solid and I blame the gelatin for that. I really don't know why one has to use gelatin in cakes at all!. I wish that the cake had looked as pink and fluffy as in the photo above, but that was not the case. The cake itself was tasty enough but I would not try this one again.

There must be better solutions around than this!

It is the best strawberry I have found, but it tasted coolaid ish.  I put cream cheese frosting on it and that helped take away the coolaid taste.

I made this cake for my son's 4th birthday.  Very disappointing!  Too dense and too sweet.  I even did as others suggested.  I reduced the sugar and gelatin as well as folded in the egg whites.  Luckily I baked this the day before so I had enough time to do another cake!

This cake is amazing!  I followed the other reviewer's instructions and sifted the flour, separated the eggs and added the beaten egg whites at the end.  A delicious cake!  I added a Fluff frosting (2 1/2 sticks butter, 1 lg. tub of Fluff, 2 t vanilla, 1/2 -3/4 c. powdered sugar) YUM - Thanks everyone for sharing!

Great cake...everyone loved it, especially the birthday girl:).  It was a bit dense and I used everyones suggestions to listed so far to make it less so.  Next time I make it, I am going to cut the jello amount in 1/2 and see if that doesn't help.  Great recipe regardless of the density though. 

I've made this again with the jello cut in half but it is still very dense.  Great flavor though.

I made this cake using 2 1/4 cups of flour and 4 tablespoons of corn starch instead of cake flour. It turned out nice and fluffy. I also didn't use the puree because I accidentally dumped in too much the first time (I had been baking for 12 hours and I was fried, no pun intended) and it turned it grey and super dense. But without the puree it turned out great, and everyone loved it. I'm using it for a wedding cake this weekend actually!

I made this cake twice now.  The first time I thought it was dense, but after reading the other reviewers suggestions decided to try again.  Both times the cake was for a birthday party and so it was made a couple days in advance, frosted, and refrigerated.  This time however, I was making a castle, so I had left over pieces of cake, which of course I couldn't wait to try.  The cake was light, fluffy and delicious!!   Absolutely the best cake I've ever had!  On the day of the party however, one of the other mothers asked me if I used POUND CAKE!  The cake had gotten very dense. - still delicious though.  Apparently this cake condenses over time, and should be eaten the day it is made if you want it to be light and fluffy.

This is a very good cake, but I'm afraid I had problems with it.  Like other reviewers, I used fresh pureed strawberries with a little sugar added.  However, that was the only change I made.  While the cake had great flavor, it came out very crumbly and easily fell apart (and they stuck to the pans!).  Luckily, I managed to salvage the cake and I frosted it with "Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting" from this site, which I was very excited about because it is perfect for this cake!  I might make this again, but probably in a 13x9 inch pan, because layer cakes are a pain in my patooty!

Turned out great I took other's reviews into consideration and made a couple adjustments-  1) Made sure to measure flour AFTER sifting. 2) Used fresh strawberry puree with no added sugar. 3) Separated eggs, whipped whites, and folded them in at the end. I made a half sheet cake, two layers. So, the recipe needed to be quadrupled. For the frosting I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. For the filling I used the frosting with strawberry puree added. YUM!  I think next time I might try using additional sugar and strawberries, rather than the Jell-O. It seemed funny to add artificial ingredients to a fresh strawberry cake.

Made exactly as written, and it turned out perfect.  I made this cake for my daughter's first birthday party and frosted it with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this site.  I sprinkled the cake with pink sugar - and it was a hit all around.  Because the cake is rather dense, a small piece goes a long way... and oh-so-good!  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe. instead of using frozen strawberries I prepared fresh strawberries like i do when i am making strawberry short cake. Then I pureed 1/2 cup of them and used the rest for garnish. i also used cream cheese frosting with red food coloring.

Okay, I made a bunch changes after reading the other reviews. I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, I only used about 3/4 of the package of gelatin, I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla, made three layers instead of two, I whipped the egg whites in at the end, and I used unsweetened fresh strawberry for the puree. I used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site and added some strawberry puree to the frosting for the middle layers. With all these changes the cake was fabulous. Yeah, its still a more dense than fluffy cake but that's not always a bad thing. Mine was definitely not too sweet especially with the frosting I choose. I rated this a 4 just because I made all these changes but with the changes it is a 5!

Amazing!! You must try this one!! I agree with the other reviewers sift the flour prior to measuring. I've used cake and all purpose, the cake flour give a lighter cake, but it is still very well worth trying the recipe with all purpose - the difference is not that much. I also separated the yolks and whites, blending the yolk with the sugar and butter mixture, and whipping the white to soft peaks and folding it into the batter at the end. Perfect for a birthday cake or cupcakes!! For the cupcakes I baked them for 15-20 minutes check with toothpick they tend to look gooey even thought they are done. Just a note the prep time is longer than 10min.

I have made this twice. The first time I read all the feedback and separated the eggs, sifted the flour and measured the strawberries closely. It came out with a heavy sweet layer and didn't impress. Round two I was in a hurry, didn't sift, didn't separate, didn't even puree the strawberries (just mashed with a fork). Turned out TERRIFIC! Will be making this for years to come.

This is the first time I've ever made or even attempt to construct a strawberry cake and I did a thorough search before selecting this recipe. It was fantastic. I followed the other tips such as sifting the flour before measuring and separating the yolks from the whites and folding it in. I also used fresh strawberries for puree. I happened to be short of round cake pans at the time but others had suggested to divide the batter among three pan so I poured the batter into two 9x9" pans. I also added cream cheese and fresh sliced strawberries between the layers. It was absolutely delicious!!! My friends were going crazy the whole time I was making it.

Very good cake.  I've used it for wedding cake before.  Yes, it is a bit dense, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I found that it doesn't freeze too well though.  Many other recipes seem more moist after freezing, but this one was definitely drier.

I made a Neapolitan cake for my friend's birthday, and I wanted a from-scratch strawberry cake recipe. This was fantastic, and I had two marriage proposals after the guests began eating (no joke). I made mine in a 13x9-inch pan, so I added 13 minutes to the baking time. Definitely follow the suggestions in the other reviews: *1.5cups of sugar *Whip egg whites separately and fold in *Sift flour  Thanks, GothicGirl!

I sifted the cake flour before measuring, I separated the egg whites to fold in at the end, and my cake was still pretty dense.  Given that the recipe yielded a delicious and moist strawberry cake, I'm going to stick to this recipe and hopefully get the fluffiness part right eventually.

This is a great, moist strawberry cake.  Much, much better than anything you can get in a box.  Usually make this into a layer cake, with fresh sliced strawberries or preserves in the middle, use a stabilized whipped cream icing that's nice and light and doesn't compete with the flavor of the cake.  What hubby wants every year for his birthday cake.

I read all the reviews and followed the tips of using three 9in pans as well as folding in the whites at the end.  Unfortunately, this cake still turned out very dense with a wierd texture.  On a postive note it tasted nice.

A+++ This is a wonderful recipe!!I got so many compliments from this and a request to make it for another party coming up!! I did separate the eggs and whip the egg whites-- also make sure that you sift the flour and make sure to use CAKE flour not regular. When I had these made I made my own strawberry frosing for the outside. I used vanilla frosting that I made for between the layers and also put strawberry slices betweenthe layers too.   This turned out amazing and I will definetly be makingg this again!

I'd never tasted strawberry cake before, and I was not overly impressed with this recipe. It was very sweet, and tasted a little artificial. The texture was a little wierd also; sort of rubbery. Almost everyone else who tried it seemed to enjoy it, however. I frosted it with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this site, which was the perfect frosting to the sweet cake. I had a little leftover batter, and used this in my new mini tea cake pan from Williams Sanoma. They were adorable, and tasted pretty good! Altogether, this cake was good, but I don't think I will make it again.

This cake was amazing! I made it for one of my mom's friend. She brought it into work and so many people have asked me for the recipe. I did not have a problem with the density, but that is probably because I measure everything by pouring the ingredient into the measuring cup with a spoon. This prevents any packing of the ingredient but not making it as light as sifting would. I made a cream cheese frosting to go with it making it "to-die-for".

Excellent-O! My choco hating daughter died and went to heaven. Perfect with cream cheese frosting. Might try 1/2 box of jello next time. Again, the very best cake recipe from allrecipes.com thus far! Bravo!

Very interesting!  Ok, my recipe modifications based on other reviews:  Cut sugar to 1.5 cups. Use unsalted butter. Use whipped egg whites only - fold in at end. Use buttermilk. Measure flour after sift. Use 2t almond extract, not vanilla. Use 1T sugar to sweeten strawberries if using unsweetened berries. Bake for 20-25min for cupcakes. I don't think it tastes like "authentic" strawberry either but it's unusual & I still like it.  Also, everyone I served it to was very impressed. Thanks for sharing.

I had a hard time finding a recipe for strawberry cake that didn't call for a cake mix. When I found this I decided to give it a try. It was a huge hit! I added a tiny bit more fresh strawberries and a touch of red food coloring for the effect, but otherwise followed the directions. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This cake is pretty good! I didn't have any cake flour so I used all-purpose and cut the amount by a 1/4 c. Then I used 1c. of unsweetened frozen strawberries and it still turned out VERY sweet (for my friends/family, but sweet enough for me), I also used arrowroot flour for the eggs and agave syrup for the sugar, agar-agar flakes and strawberry flavoring subsituted for the jello and vegan margarine for the butter. I was delighted to find out how flexible the recipe was, I had some people tell me the cake was too dense, but I thought it was just perfect! Thanks!

I made this cake for my brother's birthday and he really liked it. It was light and fluffy and not dense at all. I frosted it with whipped cream cream cheese frosting from this site.

I have used this recipe several times now and have gotten nothing but good results. It does tend to be a little dense but the flavor is fantastic! I would recomend using the "lightening" techniques mentioned by the other reviewers (beating the egg whites, measuring sifted flour and using three pans instead of two). All three of these techniques combined make the cake much lighter. All-in-all, worthy of your recipe box!

Tried this recipe today and immediatelly added it to my favourites! WOW! Hands down the best cake I have ever tried. I followed all of the suggestions: measured flour after sifting, beat the egg whites and folded them in at the end (didn't use the yolks), I used unsalted butter but added 1/8tsp salt to the flour mixture and used unsweetened frozen strawberries (I'd picked them myself this summer), also used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 which was perfect since I used a buttercream icing to decorate.  I made one 9x13 pan since I needed a sheet cake and baked for 45 minutes. It didn't rise much which was perfect since I didn't need to level it for decorating. I ran out of vanilla extract so I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract and I think that it just added to the flavour! It was a total hit and everyone asked for the recipe! Thanks for posting!

I made this cake for my birthday and it was a hit.  I followed the suggestions on shifted the cake flour before measuring and seperating the eggs.  The only suggestion I might make is cutting the strawberry geltain in half.  So the cake won't be so heavy.  But it was flavorful and super-duper moist.

Love this cake moist, fluffy and not dense as other reviews mentioned. I used only one cup of sugar (the yellow has sugar no point to use more)and turn out delicious will, this is a keeper. due to I hate box cakes, I love the challenges of make a cake from scratch. =)

Cake came out fluffy and wonderful. Used Pam with flour to grease the pan and cake came out with no problems. Read the previous reviews and separated egg whites and yolks and beat egg whites and mixed them in last. Used fresh strawberries and a tablespoon of sugar to make the puree. Will make again! Thanks.

I made this cake with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting today for 40 ladies.  It was the best cake ever.  I made in 3 layers, frosting then slices of fresh strawberries.  Beautiful presentation.  I will make again next week for a bridal shower and also for Mothers day.

I made this cake for a b-day cake for my daughters friend.It was a good cake very moist and easy to carve into flip flops.I will make again.*Note DO NOT USE REGULAR ALL PURPOSE FLOUR YOU NEED TO USE SIFTED CAKE FLOUR THEN MEASURE THE FLOUR TO WHAT THE RECIPE CALLS FOR.Instead of white sugar i used 2 cups powdered sugar in replace of  white sugar as i sometimes do and it came out just fine.

Excellent cake. I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups, butter to 1 stick, used skim milk and used only 2 yolks. It was moist, fluffy and tasted SO good. I used chocolate sauce with finely chopped strawberries between layers and chocolate frosting on top (I am a chocolate lover) and the result was fabulous.

I thought this recipe was great except that it wasn't fruity enough based on other reviews so I increased the frozen strawberries to a full 10 oz. bag of unsweetened organic berries (cascadian farm) coarsely chopped.  I also didn't want anything artificial so I substituted the flavored gelatin for 2 oz. plain gelatin and 1/3 c. strawberry preserves.  I didn't let the butter soften and both the eggs and milk were cold.  The cake came out rich and moist but dense, like a coffee cake.  I baked the cakes in two 8x8 square pans, then layered some strawberry preserves between them before frosting with the cream cheese frosting recipe mentioned in an earlier review.  It was outstanding an all the guests came back for THIRDS!

Delicious!  Everyone loved this cake.  I do think there is enough batter for 3 9 inch pans.  I made 2 9 inch pans and several cupcakes.  I also took the suggestion of using parchment paper and the cake came out easily.  I will bake again and again and again!

sensational!!! I didn't have strawberry jell-o so i used orange instead. Then i added some zest, orange extract and just a touch of yogurt in addition to the other ingredients and it was to die for! I topped it all off with an orange cream cheese frosting and, wow... all i can say is wow! great recipe- its a definite keeper!

Loved it!  Was definitely a hit!  For me, cake mixes are an insult so THANK YOU so much for a wonderful from scratch recipe!  I used vanilla icing.

This recipe was excellent, it turned out moist and delicious.  The only thing i found it that it is a very sweet cake, i think in the future when i make this cake again, i will reduce the sugar.  i think, because i am a bit of a health nut i would probably substitute half of the butter for plain yogurt.  and a word of warning, when you ice this cake, make sure that it is with an icing with very little sugar.  i made icing by simply whipping cream cheese and adding  small amounts of sugar, vanilla and some coconut cream to taste, it worked out great.

I was so disappointed. I tried a strawberry cake recipe on this site that was not from scratch before this, just to be sure we would like strawberry cake for my daughters birthday. Assuming that things from scratch are always better I was excited to make this for my little girls party. Was I ever disapointed. WAY TOO SWEET even after cutting back a little sugar and using strawberry puree from fresh unsweetened strawberries. It was also very dense. Maybe cutting back on the jello would help. I am sad to say using a boxed mix for a base and adding your own strawberry works better.

I made this cake today.  It was OK. I did it with unsweetened strawberries and it was sweet, so be sure to cut down the sugar.  Serve it with whipped cream and  not-to-sweet strawberry coulis.  It will taste better.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to eat it tomorrow to let the cake develop the strawberry flavor.  I wonder how could I enhance the strawberry flavor. Thanks.

This cake turned out perfect! Following other people's reviews, I changed the following: 1) Sifted the flour, then measured, 2) Full tablespoon of baking powder, 3) Whipped the egg whites separately and folded in. Because strawberries are in season I made the puree myself in a blender by adding strawberries, a touch of water, and some sugar. I frosted with a white frosting and added the leftover puree. Would definitely make again as a summer cake :)

This is an excellent cake.  I've made it 3 times as a layer cake and each time it was so tender that it fell apart.  I'm using it now as a sheet cake.

I have been making this recipe for years and the flavor is spot on, but something about the texture was sometimes a bit off.  Made it yesterday for my daughter's birthday and it was perfect!  Here are my tips:

1. Strawberry Puree - make a cup of puree using only fresh strawberries (no added sugar).  Use your blender or food processor to puree.  Put the puree in a saucepan and heat gently to reduce by half, stirring often.  It till take about 30 minutes.  Allow this to cool COMPLETELY (I did it the day before and refrigerated it).  The strawberry flavor was concentrated and it was not weighed down by extra sugar.   There's plenty of sugar in this cake.  Reducing the puree made for an exceptional strawberry flavor in the cake.

2. Do NOT skip sifting the cake flour and baking powder.  This makes a huge difference in the rise and texture - fluffy vs. dense.

3. Cream together the butter, sugar and strawberry gelatin (I used an organic, naturally flavored and colored strawberry gelatin and it was great!) for at least 3 minutes (may take longer) until it is light and fluffy.

4. Use 1/2 cup of buttermilk and a 1/2 cup of whole milk.  The buttermilk really makes a moist crumb.  I was afraid using all buttermilk would add too much tang, but may try that next time.

I always use the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this site on this cake.  It's the perfect!  Hope these tips help.

I thought this cake was too sweet, the texture is dense and more sponge-like.  I plan on trying this one again with less sugar and cutting the jello in 1/2.  I also separated the eggs and folded egg whites in prior to baking.  This batter did nicely in three 8 inch pans.

This cake was so delicious! As a woman who rarely bakes, and messes up all the boxed cakes; I was happy at the result.  My daughtersAnd I made this for her 9th birthday . She was extremely happy with her pink cake. I  added thinly sliced strawberries (which I soaked in simple syrup)  in between the layers for an extra natural strawberry flavor.  The only thing I would do different is go with a lighter frosting because it is a very sweet cake.

I followed the instructions of many of the other reviewers first (sift flour first, then measure, cut sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, only used 1/2 of the gelatin, separated eggs & folded in beaten whites last, and 3 9" pans, instead of 2).  I was a little worried about the gelatin taste/texture, so I opted to only use 1/3 of the package, and added 1 Tbsp. of Strawberry Emulsion instead.

The taste was pretty good, and since I'm making it again in a few hours, I would definitely make it again LOL.  I'm making an ombre cake, and need 3 more layers.

The loss of star is because the recipe is a little cumbersome to make, and because the OP should have been more specific with regard to the flour measurement. Thankfully I checked the reviews first, but one shouldn't have to look in the reviews for the recipe instructions.

Great recipe. Just make sure to sift your cake flour and then measure, because it is asking for 2 3/4  SIFTED cake flour.

I just made this account to say thank you very much to the person who posted this recipe as well as all the commenters who also helped me greatly to achieve success. Let me explain, I am a 34 year old male who is an underground miner. My only experience with making a cake came from a box when I was a child. I love strawberries and decided to challenge myself and it turned out amazing! If you follow all instructions exactly, including the comment about sifting the amount of flour instead of using just the amount told, it will come out perfect. Trust me, if I can do this ANY ONE CAN! The only thing is that for us pure amateurs, the strawberry puree is not instructed how to do. A simple Google search solved that in a hurry. 2 cups of strawberries, 1/4 cup of sugar make 1 1/4 of a cup puree. Now I just need to improve my hack job at icing cakes... but I don't think I'll be quitting my job anytime soon to become a baker. Thank you once again to everyone, even the negative comments kept me focused.

I baked the cake in a 9x12 pan and no icing; it was still delicious although, it got a little heavy after a while.  But not to worry; I still ate it.  I cleaned my own strawberries and if you go that route you have to prep the strawberries with sugar at least one day ahead. And I put my fruit through a Nutribullet.     So can you use this basic recipe and vary the fruit puree/ gelatin combinations?  Such as : blueberry cake or peach cake?  Like raspberry jello with peach puree?   May 1st:  I used pineapple and pineapple jelly and yes you can. In a bigger pan I believe I needed to bump the temperature to 400.

This cake is amazing! I have made is several times and it always turns out great. Mine is always topped with cream cheese icing. You do not need to separate the egg whites and yolks (I never do) but you should always sift flour when making a cake, then measure it.

THE CAKE WAS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!  SUPER MOIST AND HAS BECOME A FAMILY FAVORITE....I DID USED HALF THE VANILLA REQUIREMENT AND ADDED STRAWBERRY EXTRACT FOR THE OTHER HALF AND A FEW DICED STRAWBERRIES THAT WAS FROM THE FRESH STRAWBERRY PUREE I MADE!!
I ALSO ADDED ONLY 4 OUNCES OF CREAM CHEESE , FRESH STRAWBERRY PUREE,  HALF A CUP OF POWDERED SUGAR AND COOL WHIP FOR MY ICING....FOR A FINAL TOUCH STRAWBERRY PUREE ON  TOP AS WELL....MMMMMMM

I made a few of the recommended changes- folding in egg whites, buttermilk, etc. My only concern -and this is my go-to recipe for strawberry cake- is how to combat the dryness. Yesterday when I was frosting it, I had a bit of an overhang that I cut off. It was great, as usual, but when the cake was delivered today for a birthday, the only issue was the dryness. I had it refrigerated in a cake box and know it lent to to the dryness. Are there any recommendations on making it more moist?

I tried twice to make this for my daughter's birthday. No luck even with using sifted cake flour. The second time I did not use gelatin - only strawberry purée, and I double sifted the flour  -- somehow it turned out almost the same as the first. It's a very very dense cake. Tasted ok but the texture was totally off.

I done exactly what the recipe said everyone loved it but I thought it was to moist it did not rise that much I will try it again but I think a bunt cake will be better.

I made it with one less egg, because mine were big. I made a whipped cream cheese frosting and everyone loved them !!  I will make these many times in the future !!

I made this cake without using the jello, but reduced sweetened strawberries in it's place.  Always sift your flour and then spoon it lightly into the measuring cup (unless the recipe says otherwise). The scoop method packs it in and will give you too much flour for the recipe.  The cake density was perfect for our family.  I filled/iced with a swiss meringue buttercream that had a wild strawberry compound added to it.

I made this cake yesterday for my daddy's 76th birthday. It was a huge hit with the family. 

After noticing several comments here about the density of the cake, I first researched how to prevent this problem. This is what I learned...they mean it when an ingredient's temperature is listed as room temperature. Do that.  Also, I learned light and fluffy is developed in the mixing of the butter, sugar, and eggs. Creaming the butter and sugar until light and fluffy creates "air bubbles" which is important in the process of the cake rising during the baking process. The addition of the eggs creates more air to help develop the desired texture, but the eggs should be added slowly. Yesterday I beat the eggs separately and then added them, a spoonful at a time to the creamed butter/sugar mixture. It takes a bit of time, but if you're going the extra mile with a made from scratch cake, I think the added 5 - 10 minutes is well worth it. Adding the flour and baking powder is a delicate process simply because you don't want to overwork it and compromise the effort that you've already put in. Using a metal spoon or a thin rubber spatula to gently fold in the flour will prevent crushing the bubbles that you created earlier. I also learned some time back that the rising occurs in the first twenty minutes of baking. During that time it is important to not open the oven door, affecting the oven temperature, thereby possibly causing the cake to fall.

This recipe is my new go-to for strawberr

I did not care for this recipe. I've baked my whole life.  The batter looked fabulous. I was confident they'd be delicious. Boy, was I wrong. I made them into cupcakes, they all sunk in in the middle. The finished product was not fluffy. They looked unappealing, nothing I could bring to a party. I thought they may still taste good and could be enjoyed at home. Nope.  I remade the batter and this time folded in the egg whites at the end. Same result. Same consistency.

JUST FINISHED MAKING THE STRAWBERRY CAKE FROM SCRATCH, THEN ONLY THING I WOULD SAY THAT I DID NOT SEE IS THE COLOR OF THE CAKE, MAYBE I MISSED SOMETHING BUT I FOLLOWED ALL THE STEPS AS IT APPEARS ON WEBSITE. THE COLOR OF MY BREAD CAME OUT LIGHT BROWN, I WONDER IF I SHOULD HAVE ADDED MORE STRAWBERRIES? OVERALL THE CAKE WAS GREAT AND TASTY.

tried this cake recipe recently and it was delicious but was very dense and heavy. I used the recipe exactly as it called for. I will try it again but this time I will separate the eggs like others have suggested. The taste was very good though and everyone liked it but I did not like the density of the cake. I did use a cream cheese/sugar icing which was perfect and delicious.

Followed the directions exactly, we found the cake was wonderful when chilled. Homemade cream cheese icing was delicious. We're making 7 of these for a Church gathering this weekend, so we're using 9x13 sheet pans...

Great recipe! Will definitely make again, but with slightly less sugar - maybe 1 1/2c.? My only real issue was that my layers sank. Luckily, it was for my daughter's birthday, and only immediate family ate it (and loved it!), but still... It took quite a bit of frosting to fill the sinkholes. I love dense cake, so I didn't do any separating of the eggs. I used fresh strawberries, and I used my own buttercream recipe with puréed strawberries added. The gelatin adds good extra strawberry flavor.

Cake tasted much too artificial. I followed recipe except for separating egg yolks and beat whites into peaks and added separately as recommended. Cake did not turn out dense and texture was fine BUT the Jello dominates the flavor, that i may as well have baked a box cake! I also tried a second run with much less Jello flavoring and it was slightly better but I still would not make this again.

My guests raved and I might sneak a piece for breakfast this a.m. It was amazing! This is one of the best cakes I've ever made. 
-didn't bother separating the eggs and it was fine
-did measure the flour after sifting
-did reduce sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was perfect
-used fresh unsweetened strawberries
-cooked it in a 11 x 15 pan

I made cream cheese frosting (2 lbs powdered sugar with 2 packages cream cheese, which was too much frosting, half that would probably be fine). Used more of the strawberry puree to beat frosting to the consistency I wanted.

Another time I made it with cherry jello and stirred in half a can of cherry pie filling. The other half can, I beat into 1 lb of powdered sugar and 1 block of cream cheese. This was still more frosting than I needed for an 11x15 pan but would likely be enough for a two-layer cake if spread thinly. Also delicious!

This cake was great. I followed others suggestions about using only the egg whites from the eggs and adding them into the mixture at the very end. I also used fresh strawberry that I put into the freezer a couple hours before. When watching the video it said if you use fresh strawberries to add sugar to them a few hours before. I did not add sugar to the fresh strawberries and I would not recommend it. The cake was sweet enough. It only took a little slice to hit the spot. I will definitely make again but I think next time I may try adding a little less sugar. I used some of the leftover puree in between the layers of cake. I baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Just check the cake after 20 minutes. If it's not done check it every 5 minute after till tooth pick comes out clean.

Good recipe. I did changed a couple of minor things. I used sour cream instead of milk and added a teaspoon of baking soda. I also made a strawberry puree, but I cooked my fresh strawberries and made a syrup then pureed them. When the puree cooled it was like strawberry preserves. Put that in between my layers and also in the cake and the cream cheese icing. I also used cake flour and lined my pans with parchment paper. OMG, what a cake. We put most of it in the freezer so we wouldn't eat all of it. It freezes well. Thanks for the scratch recipe.

Baked as directed for Mother's Day surprise, and strawberry cake recipe came out perfect. Excellent texture, flavorful, and moist. I ended up having to make another after the first on went so fast. Tried with buttercream, and white frostings, both were great. Thanks in bunches. Happy Mother's Day to all you wonderful mother's

This cake was incredible!! Followed the advice of others. I seperated the egg whites and yolks. Whipped the whites into soft peaks and folded them in. Also, I sifted the flour and then after sifting measured it again. I spread some strawberry puree in between the two cake layers along with icing and it was very moist!  I do not bake a lot and this cake turned out great. Everyone was impressed.

My 6 year son has been asking me to make him a strawberry cake for some time now.  I found this recipe and I am so glad I did.  Everyone loved it, even my picky 13 year old.  I followed the recommendation to separate the egg yolks and egg whites.  I first mixed the yolks with the batter and later folded in the softly whipped egg whites.  Also I stirred in the flour and the milk, then I used the blender to mix in the strawberry purée.  I did not use any strawberry gelatin.  My cake is so moist.  If I did not know better I would of thought that I used a cake mix and not cake flour!

It's good. The few changes I made were as followed; I used all purpose flour because I ran out of cake flour (2 1/4 cup). I also used cherry jello mix since it was all I had left. The cake is really moist. I made the "icing" out of pudding and whipped cream. It's good, oh and last thing, I cut the sugar content to a bit less than 1 cup because I have family members who are diabetic.  The jello mix and whipped topping added the rest of the sugar.

I have been baking cakes for 40 years and the scratch strawberry cake really caught my eye.  I read all the reviews and with all the reviews of this cake being too dense, I don't get it.  This cake was fantastic.
I make all the birthday cakes for our entire business and some said this was my best cake of all I had made and believe me I have made a lot of cakes.  I put puree between each layer and semi froze the layers then iced them.  I did make three layers and this cake was beautiful.  I put strawberries on top and served puree with each slice.  Loved it!

The foundation of a really good cake is here but it would have been very dense indeed had I not read the reviews and done some tweeking of my own.  I followed the advice of separating the eggs and whipping the whites.  I also reduced the flour to 2 1/2 cups, omitted the vanilla, and used 3/4 cup of strawberry puree versus 1/2 a cup.  After making these changes I had a light cake with excellent strawberry flavor, but doesn't taste artificial like a lot of strawberry cakes do.

Ok, def a great recipe! I agree to add the teaspoon of salt and sift the flour before measuring as others have suggested. I also used the strawberry buttercream icing as suggested by Naples. This cake was amazing! I made it for my bday, only lasted 3 days for 3 people, plus made coworkers jealous with pictures of my pretty pink cake;)

I dont normally rate recipes but I really did not like this one. I followed everything exact, and it was so dense and artificial tasting. It looked nice n pink sure but it tasted so bad. I was convinced I made a mistake so I tryed it again, extra carefully, and still has the same problem

My friends really enjoyed this cake.  It had a very nice strawberry flavor and the consistency was perfect.  I read most of the reviews first and then added only 1/2 the jello, used fresh strawberries and added a litte of the puree to the cake batter.  If you follow the directions, esuring your flour is sifted and alternate adding the eggs it should be fine. Remember not to overbeat the batter. I will make this again for our next summer picnic.  Good luck and enjoy!

I used shortening instead of butter and I only added the egg yolks, while I whipped the egg whites into a meringue and folded them into the batter. It came out with a very nice crumb.

Great recipes cakes came out nice and fluffy. I however read other reviews that said too much jello was used so I used less and heavy cream instead. Delicious. Thanks.

I own a small baking business and had a client send me this recipe to make for her. I was skeptical because of the jello but did it anyways because it is her favorite. NEVER AGAIN. The cake itself baked nicely in a Wilton shaped pan (again, client request) but then I attempted to make cupcakes out of this batter. What a MESS! They all collapsed, made a huge mess and were a complete bust. I'll go back to my own recipe for cupcakes next time.

Made this for mil's birthday.  The recipe made 24 cupcakes, and everyone raved about them.  Good thing I took them all, some had 2 or 3.  Now that is a compliment.  I did use the icing recipe off of the strawberry cake using boxed cake mix...this is my husbands favorite recipe

I SO wanted to like this cake, but nope. It didnt work. I joined AR to write a review of this cake. I was SO disappointed. I followed the reviews, used 1c sugar, sifted my flour (and used less than the recipe called for, per other reviewers, beat my egg whites to peaks, and followed the rest to a T. The three layers never really rose and the cake was so dense. Everyone said the flavor was great - "tastes like strawberry ice cream." But the texture was all wrong. The birthday boy mentioned it was probably "just cold." Bummer. On the hunt for a new strawberry cake recipe.

This is a delicious moist cake that doesn't last for a weekend!  I followed the recipe and there's nothing dense about it.  In fact it was the complete opposite. I brought one to work and my coworkers loved it and even offered to pay me to make cakes for them.  The biggest test was my mom. She can find something wrong with anything and she Loved this cake. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Delicious.  Comes out moist and dense, which suits the preferences of my family.  After looking through numerous reviews, I adopted these changes:  Added 1/2 tsp salt; reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups; used all purpose flour and cornstarch (2 TBSPs corn starch plus enough all purpose flour to make one cup) as I did not have cake flour; used 2 percent milk; used unsweetened fresh strawberries to make puree; used 2 9-inch cake pans; when frosting, put some raspberry preserves between the layers for a little tang!  it was fabulous

The cake turned out dense for me, but it was yummy. I found that the taste even seemed to get better after a day or two. People were pleasantly with how strong the strawberry flavor was.

Made this as a birthday cake from my sister. Everyone thought I was bringing the normal yellow cake with a layer of gross slimy strawberries in the middle. What a hit! My uncle who doesn't like cake ate a whole piece... the waitress we gave a slice to came out of the kitchen because she "just had to kiss me" because it was so good! Very moist and fluffy! Great recipe! (I added almond extract to my buttercream frosting and that was a nice touch!)

My cake turned out flat and hard.  I thought the cake would turn out a lot better with such a high star rating, but unfortunately it wasn't until after I made the cake that I saw people's reviews.  People had issues with the measurement of the flour and one expert separated her egg yolks.  A cake recipe must have the right measurements and information (egg separating, etc.) in order to have a successful cake.  I spent so much time on making this cake and I'm not comfortable to show it off. Sad affair.

Great recipe. I made cupcakes and filled them with strawberry cream, then made homemade lemon/cream cheese frosting and put crushed lemon drops on top. Strawberry lemonade cuppies were gobbled up.

Great recipe, kinda sweet. I would cut back sugar by 2/3 cup since the gelatin has sugar already. Everything else is just perfect!

As for different flavors, I made this recipe again, without strawberries and using chocolate instant pudding mix (small) and adding melted unsweetened chocolate squares ( 4 - 2 ounce each) for the full recipe. This was delicious! Maybe you can try it with other pudding mixes too. Again, I suggest to cut down the sugar by 2/3 cup. The cake turned out moist and fluffy.

The flavor was good but I did not like that the cakes did not rise nicely.  It was dense.  I will not make this recipe again.

Excellent recipe! The texture and density were perfect. I made mine in a 9x12 pan instead of two 9-inch rounds and baked it for about 35-40 minutes, and it turned out great. Consistently baked from edge to edge. Be sure to use CAKE flour and sift it before measuring. My only reason for not giving it five stars is that I was hoping for a stronger berry flavor. This tasted more like a yellow cake with a hint of strawberry than the tangy flavor of a true strawberry cake...and I even doubled the amount of strawberry puree. Still, I would definitely make this cake again.

This was so good!  I didn't read the reviews first, so I made it per the recipe.  Didn't sift the flour before measuring and didn't beat the egg whites first, and it still came out great.  Frosted with a basic butter cream frosting.  My family said it was the best cake I've ever made.

This recipe is a slight variation (because of the sugar) of one my mother made for us as children. It is a good cake. Although she used far less sugar, with the Jell-o, it makes it far too sweet. Also, you can use AP flour instead or mix AP and cake flour.

I made this for a friend for her birthday, and everyone, including me, loved it. The leftovers ended up going to her office, where they were quickly devoured. A very nice recipe, and pretty easy to make. I made it exactly as per the recipe, and iced it with the "sturdy whipped cream frosting" from this site, which was perfect.

I tried quite a few strawberry cake recipes before settling on this one.  It's not too sweet, and not too bland either.  I tried to puree the strawberries only slightly because the cake is it's best when you get a small chunk of berry in your bite on occassion.  Definitely will be making these again.

this cake was absolutely heavenly!  I took the suggestion of others and only used egg whites and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2c. I used frozen unsweetened strawberries and didn't add any extra sugar. since I used a bundt pan, I had to bake for abt 55min since the center was not done. It was very moist and the color was beautiful. I also frosted with cream  cheese frosting and it was a big hit with the family!

Baked the cake longer then suggested. The cake was baked all the way on the outside but it was too moist in the middle. When I tried to take it out of the pan it started to crumble but the middle was was still sticking to the pan.  Not sure what I did wrong. Will look for a different recipe.

If i could rate it 10 stars i would.  this might be my favorite cake i've ever made.  it was so moist and light.  the taste was a perfect combo of sweet and tart.  The only change i made was to whip and fold in the egg whites separately.  thank you so much for this recipe!

I had a request for a strawberry cake for a birthday and I decided to try this recipe.  I read prior reviews and so I tweaked it a bit.  I cut the sugar down by a 1/4 cup because the strawberry jello has sugar in it.  I separated the eggs and whipped the whites prior to adding to batter as others suggested in their posts. I used caked flour and I remeasured after sifting it for accuracy. I used vanilla bean paste. Lastly I added close to 3/4 of strawberry puree.  I used 2 9-inch pans.  After baking and cooling,  I put strawberry filling between the two layers.  I frosted with vanilla bean buttercream frosting.  I had no problem with density.  The cake was light and rich.  Reminded me a little of DH box mix, but BETTER! Thank you for sharing this recipe!  As a dessert caterer, I think this recipe is definitely a keeper. Glad I found it just in time for strawberry season.  Yay!!  For a lighter cake, perhaps modifying an angel food recipe with the Jello and strawberry puree would help...just a thought.

Very tasty, but it was dense.  I imagine that was due to the butter, I would probably try oil next time.  Frosted with vanilla buttercream.  I gave it 4 stars only because I would have liked it lighter and fluffier.

i made these into cupcakes. i followed the recipe almost exactly. changes: read a few people thought it was to sweet so i only used 1 1/2 of sugar and i separated egg yolks and whites, beat the whites until they were a fluff and folded in at the end before putting in the over. baked the cupcakes for about 13 minutes and they were perfect. they looked great, texture was great, and they tasted pretty good but they still had an artificial flavor probably because of the jello. will make again until i find a strawberry cake from actual scratch. thanks for the recipe.

I made both mini and regular sized cupcakes for my daughter's birthday. They turned out light, moist and delicious. I measured the flour after I sifted it, and added the dry ingredients in small amounts. I used the special buttercream frosting from this site to top them. A huge hit with everyone.

This recipe has great flavor! After a couple of attempts I discoved that adding a little extra flour (maybe 3-4 tbsps) firms the cake up a little nicer. All in all great recipe.

I didn't think this was too dense nor too sweet as other reviewers did; I used a cream cheese frosting and it was perfect. I've tried another strawberry cake from scratch recipe from this site and this one was far better. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake for my boyfriends birthday party and everyone loved it! I even had a guest tell me it was the best strawberry cake they'd ever had. I made the purée from fresh sfrawberries and sugar and fluffed the egg whites at the end- it was amazing. Props!

This cake was a little dense even after taking suggestions from others and tweaking a little, but honestly, it didn't bother me a bit!  The flavor was delicious-Added fresh strawberries and cut down on the gelatin, and used cream cheese icing.  Will certainly make again.

I really liked this cake, but I had two problems with it: It was really, really dense, even though I folded the egg whites in last, and I could taste the Jell-O flavor. But all in all, this is a cake you should try. I combined it with a whipped cream/cream cheese frosting, and the taste was amazing.

ok tonight was my first time making this cake.  i hardly ever bake just mostly cook but i recently signed up for a cake decorating class so i thought i would give this a whirl. first off i followed the other reviews and sifted the flour then mesured. i also cut the gelatin to 3/4 the package.  i used fresh strawberries and no sugar.  i also put a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of bananna extract.  at the end i seperated the egg whites and yolks then folded them in.  i used three pans instead of two and the cakes were done in 25 min (less batter less time) after it cooled i put one layer down and leveled it. i then put a thin level of pink bananna frosting that i made on it then i put strawberry jam and sliced banannas down i repeted this for the next layer.  i then garnished the top.

the cake turn out great.I did exactly like the recipe but i sifted flour b4 measuring, topping it using cream cheese and white topping, i forgot to beat the egg white seperately until forming stiff peak, fluffy so it turn out dense and heavy, the flavor is amazing but i prefer less sweet( 1 1/5 sugar would be perfect), i like it though maybe make it again

I made this cake for my daughter's 6th Birthday. She wanted a strawberry cake and I was surprised when I could not find one from scratch. I read all the reviews, but once I started this cake I realized I did not have CAKE FLOUR. I think this is the problem some people may have had. I thought it was a bit heavy, not nearly light and fluffy, but went over great! I used a buttercream icing with fondont which make it look fabulous! My daughter said it was a wedding cake! I will be keeping this recipe and be sure to use cake flour next time.

I used this recipe to make a very pink hello kitty birthday cake today. Everyone loved it! The adults all turned it down at first - but once one tried it they ALL had some and said that it was "excellent."  I used the "Sturdy Whipped Cream" recipe for the frosting, and filled it with a swseet cream cheese filling and a thin layer of really good quality strawbery preserves. I also beat the egg whites and added them in seperately. In my ovens, this cake took nearly 40 minutes to  bake, but it was moist and easy to layer. Very good recipe!

Wonderful cake.  I made it for my hubby's birthday.  The only thing I changed was seperating the eggs and whipping the whites to fold in at the end.  It has a great strawberry flavor.

I love to make this cake. It always comes out flawless. Instead of frozen strawberries, I puree fresh strawberries and add a little sugar if they are not sweet enough.   I tried the suggestion of seperating the egg whites and whipping them in soft peaks and then adding them at the end. This really made my cake rise more and very light and moist.  This truly is a 5 star strawberry cake that I will continue to make.

I gave this 4 stars b/c a few other people seemed to like them but I was not really a fan.  A bit too 'fake' strawberry for me which I assume was from the gelatin.  I did use fresh strawberries with sugar which I think would be better than the frozen.  I think if I want a strawberry tasting cupcake I'd prefer a yellow cake with strawberry frosting.

turned out fluffy and delicious. I followed the other reviews of beating egg whites then folding them in at the end. The batter tasted like strawberry ice cream so I made a vanilla butter cream to go on it. Enough batter to make a rocking horse pan and 5 cupcakes.

This had the best strawberry flavor. I baked it a little longer than the instructions (about 10 mins), just because my oven always seems to underbake cakes. Think I might have overdid it a bit because it was a little dry, but still very good. I also made a lot of very sweet cream cheese frosting to frost it with. The frosting overpowered the cake a bit. Might do it with a little less frosting next time.

My husband wanted a strawberry cake for his birthday and this recipe was delicious!!  I used 2- 9 inch square pans and made a chocolate cake middle layer...with a homemade whipped cream filling with sliced strawberries.  I also used the whipped cream to frost the cake too.  I added slivered almonds to the sides of the cake and decorated the top and bottom of the cake with whole strawberries and chocolate shavings...it was beautiful and delicious and held up really well in the fridge.

Made this cake last weekend for the 64th Block House Steeplechase and it was wonderful!  The taste and texture were perfect.  I frosted with white chocolate buttercream so it held up well being outdoors.  Thanks to GothicGirl for a great recipe!  You can see the pic#59.  Decorated to look like a derby hat!  I believe it will become a Steeplechase tradition!

We LOVE LOVE LOVED this recipe!  I did use fresh strawberries and made my own puree-they were overly ripe and sweet enough to not need sugar.  Others have spoke on the texture of the cake...I made an easy cool whip/cream cheese frosting (which was PERFECT for this cake!) and had a small slice before putting it in the fridge, the cake was more light and airy.  After a few hours in the fridge, the cake was more dense, but NOT in a bad way!  Maybe the gelatin in the recipe?  Who knows, who cares, TRY IT;)

YUMMY!!! This cake was sweet and spongy and had a great color! Big hit with my dad. Strawberry cake is his birthday request every year and I decided to start making them from scratch when I took over for my mom. This was the only recipe I found for it but it was DELICIOUS! Thanks!

I made this cake for a friend of mine, who loves strawberries, and it came out great, she loved it! I followed all of the suggestions in the reviews and it definitely helped. The density was PERFECT and the cake was able to hold up a thick layer of fondant. It took a bit longer to bake, maybe around 40-45 minutes, but it still came out fine.

Light, fluffy, pretty and delicious! I made it for my 4-year-olds birthday and had 3 adults say they wanted it for there's as well. I folded in the egg whites last and made in three layers. Put strawberry puree in between the layers and topped with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site.

I don't even like strawberry cake, but I was making it for my grandmother...I absolutely LOVED it. It's delicious, especially with cream cheese icing. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an amazing strawberry cake. The texture and taste were perfect.

I made this cake yesterday for a birthday party and it was really good and pretty easy to make. It also really seemed to impress people. I topped it with a cream cheese icing which complimented the cake well.

I made this for my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved it! I separated the eggs and added the beaten whites at the end and I also cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups. One more thing I did was add about 1/2 cup of Polaner's strawberry All Fruit. Fabulous! I'll make this again.

This was the first ever "From Scratch" cake I have attmepted and I have to say it turned out FANTASTIC! I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups, sift the flour first ( mix of 2/3 unbleached all purpose and 1/3 whole wheat), and beat the egg whites to soft peaks and folded in at the very end as suggested by other reviewers. It was amazing if I do say so myself! I ate so much I decided to go off refined sugar this month to detox! Now my other daughter wants the same cake for her birthday next week so I am going to try it with Stevia. Thank you sooooooo much! I will never do a cake from a box again!

I rated this cake a 4 just because it fell when I brought it out of the oven.  I made it for my husbands birthday and it was a hit, I made it just like the recipe said and the taste was perfect.

Hey GothicGirl, your the best. I cut the recipe in half and made cupcakes with vanilla buttercream frosting. Reduced cooking time to 19 min. Other than that, did nothing different and had great results. The batter tasted just like a strawberry shake from the place with billions served.

I also separated the eggs, added the whites at the end. I used 1 t rasp extract and 2 t van, sifted then measured the flour, added 1 t baking soda(in addition to the baking powder), cut the butter down to 3/4 cup, then added 1/4 sour cream in place(also to balance out the ph from the addition of the baking soda), and cut the sugar down to 1 3/4 cup. I also used cherry sugar free jello instead of strawberry. The cake ended up airy and moist, not too dense. I baked it in a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper and then made cream cheese frosting with some fresh strawberries, diced up in the frosting. I spread the frosting then rolled it up into a strawberry roll instead of a pumpkin roll. Turned out fabulous!

I made this recipe twice once with egg and once with vegan egg substitute.  The fist time was for my son's 3 birthday of the middle car of this train, along with some cupcakes.  I topped them with butter cream icing.  The second time I made cupcakes and topped them with a cream cheese butter cream frosting.  Everyone seemed to like them both times, I didn't really think it was anything special.  I probably won't make this recipe again.

Unfortunatly, this did not work out for me.  I don't think I will try it again.  The cake fell in the oven, and fell apart when I took it out of the pan.  I had made it for my daughter's 1st birthday and now I don't know what I am going to do...yikes.

I made this cake for Memorial Day cookout and it was the highlight of the day.  This cake baked up perfectly and I used a cream cheese frosting recipe and put fresh strawberries between the layers.  I followed the advice of others by measuring the cake flour after it was sifted, and also separting the egg yoks from the whites.  I also used fresh strawberries to make my puree.  This will definitly go down as one of my favorites.

I made this for a get-together with some very picky eaters, and everyone loved it! I followed another reviewer's suggestion to whip the egg whites separately and fold them into the batter last, and ended up with an extremely moist, fluffy cake. I used two 9-inch round cake pans, and found that I had to extend the baking time by about 15 minutes. I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this website, adding a layer of sliced fresh strawberries between the two layers. I will definitely make this again!

I was glad to find a recipe for strawberry cake from scratch.  I used this recipe, along with a white cake recipe, to make a checkerboard cake for a friend's birthday.  I also had a problem with the density of the cake.   I read the first review, and now that I know what the problem was, won't have the same result next time!  Thanks for a homemade strawberry cake recipe!

My daughter turned 3 recently and I did a strawberry shortcake themed party. I wanted a true strawberry cake for her,  so I tired this. The cake was delicious! I had some problems with it falling apart. I noticed another reviewer did also. However, I think my problem may have been I wasn't able to properly grease the pan. But either way the cake was delicious and everyone loved it!

I made this cake today and it came out beautifully! I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and whipped the egg whites. I think people are getting mixed results because they are altering the recipe too much. When I read that this cake was dense cake I thought that I might be able to use it for petits fours, but this cake came out light, airy and delicious. I guess I do like the jello taste. I used fresh strawberry puree as suggested. I think next time I will try it with pureed strawberry jam. That way I can make it in winter too. THX

I made this for Easter.  I might have rated it a 4 because even with separating the eggs and using 3 layers as suggested by others, it still came out dense.  But the flavor and the rave reviews justify the 5 stars.  My fiance has requested this for his birthday next month, but with more frosting.  I used a cream cheese frosting.  I also pureed a 16 oz. container of frozen strawberries and used the extra puree in between the layers.  Just think first and frost the layer and then put the puree on.  Otherwise, it is hard to spread the frosting and the layers slide.  Obvious if you think about it, but not obvious enough for me to do it right on the first layer.

I made this cake last night but instead of making a layer cake I made cup cakes and I used a vanilla frosting. They were delicious.I got so many compliments from my toughest critics (my kids). I pureed fresh strawberries with a little sugar so I cut the sugar down in the cake from 2c to 1 1/2c and it was perfect. I brought some to work this morning my co-worker said she felt like she was biting into a strawberry dream, lol. Definiteley a keeper.

I thought this cake was excellent. Mine came out more like a pound cake but so good. I used whipped cream cream cheese frosting on it (from this site) It was delicious! I would definitely recommend this recipe!

I used regular flour instead of cake flour and this turned out to be a dense cake. Very good, we like the dense cakes in this house more than the fluffy ones. My husband who does not like cake asks for this one.

The flavor was kind of bland (maybe because I cut back on the sugar) and it was very dense. I also thought the gelatin made it taste a little strange.

Oh my this was a great recipe even if I did use it to make a Blackberry cake with it from leftover blackberries I had after making Brigid's Blackberry Pie from this site also.  I followed recipe exactly except for the berry change and the flavor of jello change and I did sift the flour before measuring and I made three layer cake as it is dense and the three layers with frosting from this site Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frostng was to die for.  Okay so I did make a few changes but it is awesome recipe to work with. Everyone loved it can't wait to make it with strawberries.

I was asked to make a strawberry cake for a wedding reception. I tripled this recipe and make a two layer 1/2 sheet cake. I used fluffy 7 minute frosting and put strawberry jam in the middle. I also made it with lactose free milk as was necessary. It came out so lucious. I have many people asking for the recipe. The  store bought cake went to work the next day. This one was gone. It was wonderful. A Keeper for sure.

I used cream cheese for the frosting but instead of using only regular cream cheese i used one regular and one strawberry cream cheese. I added chocolate shavings on top and it was heaven !!

I'm always searching for a good scratch cake recipe, and I love strawberry cake, so this one definitely fit the bill. I made it into cupcakes for a party this weekend, and they were a big hit! They were very moist and had a wonderful flavor. It did come out with a sticky crust, didn't rise very high, and was quite dense, as others have mentioned, so I might try using less sugar next time; this should also help those who had trouble releasing the cakes from their pans. But overall this is a wonderful recipe, and I would highly recommend it!

While I did not care for this recipe - too sweet - everyone I served it to had nothing but wonderful things to say about it!  I made it as a layer in a wedding cake, and it was definitely the favorite!

I didn't make any changes, and served it with a homemade buttercream.

Loved this recipe.  My husband is very picky about sweets and he demolished two slices in one sitting.  The cake was quite dense but still very moist.  I used fresh chopped strawberries instead of the puree and put sliced strawberries between the layers.  I used the "Cream Cheese II" recipe from this site for the icing, which was a perfect pairing.

I needed to make a cake and didn't want to go to the store to buy a mix.  It was just as easy as a mix, too!  I used raspberry sugar-free jello (what I had in the cupboard) and I had a frozen berry blend instead of just strawberries.  Next time I would strain out the seeds from the berries, but it was still tasty.  It took significantly longer to bake, closer to 40 minutes for 2 9 inch pans.  It was a little dense, but my 4 year old was helping, so I figured it was overmixed, plus I used regular flour instead of sifted cake flour - I like a dense cake, so I didn't mind and nobody else complained!!

My family raved about it, thanks for such a great recipe! The only thing I changed was the icing - I added about a cup more sugar because I'm not that fond of a strong cream cheese taste, and I added about 2 tablespoons of strawberry juice. Yurm!

Not really what I expected, or really wanted.  It's an old-fashioned tasting cake and the consistency is denser than I wanted.  I reduced the sugar and butter, and used fresh mashed strawberries, and it tastes really, really good, but just really, really dense.  I have a devils food cake recipe that I think I can make into strawberry cake that is identical to the boxed mixes.  Won't make again.

The cake itself is without at doubt delicious. But why doesn't it have a filling? I ended up putting whipped cream and sliced strawberries in between the two layers. I used a buttercream frosting, which failed miserably. But the cake was still great and everybody was raving about it!

It was a really good cake and easy to make, it was soft and moist when it came out. I took the other reviewer's advice and whipped the egg whites seperatly and that really helped make it more moist. The only problem was that the cake stuck to the pan and it also fell apart at the end, I had to patch it up with icing. It also had a lot of sugar I would reccommend cutting down on it somewhat. Otherwise it was a great strawberry cake.

very very delicious!!  i used raspberry jello because i didn't have any strawberry, and i reduced both the sugar and the flour by 1/2 cup each.  i seperated the eggs and whipped the egg whites until foamy, then added them in the end.  it made 24 cupcakes (18 minutes in the oven) and i had no density/moistness problems like other people seemed to have.

This cake was wonderfully yummy. It did sink a bit in the middle but I had no problems at all with it sticking to the pan. (I greased and floured each pan) For frosting, I mixed cream cheese, some of the left-over strawberry puree and some powered sugar; and inbetween the two layers, I poured some of the puree there as well. The entire cake was eaten in a matter of minutes!! Very Tasty!! : )

This was very dense and artificial tasting.  The strawberry jello should have been a clue that this would not taste very good.  Also, I did not find this cake sweet at all as others complained about.  I would pass this one up.

This was very moist but not as flavorful as I had hoped. Still, the best strawberry cake I've had yet. I may make again, perhaps with more puree or thicker puree next time.

I just made this cake this afternoon, and we gave it a taste.  Pretty good.  Moist, not too sweet(which we love that about it) and fairly easy to make.  I pureed strawberries added cornstarch and powdered sugar to a saucepan and brought it to a boil to make a slightly sweet/tart strawberry filling. I then "iced" it with Cool Whip, and let it sit in the fridge while we ate lunch.  Tasted very good.  Tart strawberry filling and light cool whipped topping on a moist cake!!

This is without a doubt a three layer cake.  To help it not stick to your cake pans simply butter the pans and then line the bottom with parchment paper and butter it well.  I didn't even use flour as the cake pulled away from the sides when it was done.  I cut the parchment paper by outlining the bottom of the pans with a pencil and cutting out the circle.  It will fit perfectly and your cakes are guaranteed not to stick!  The cake is moist and delicious and a chocolate ganache frosting will make it to die for!

Very moist and tasty! I used two 8x8 square pans that are pretty deep and they worked out great. I left it in a few minutes longer since the pans were thicker. I also added about 1/4 more real strawberries than were called for. Topped it with cream cheese frosting and it was awesome. Will make again and again. Beats any cake mix thats for sure!!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes for a party and everyone loved it. I prepared it with a light cream cheese frosting and added a chocolate-dipped strawberry half to the top of each cupcake. It was the perfect summer treat; I will definitely use this recipe again.

I decorate cakes and a customer wanted a strawberry cake.  I read several recipes and decided on this one.  Well...I'm glad I did.  The cake is WONDERFUL!!!  It isn't a real sweet cake so it will be great with a rich buttercream frosting.  I would have given it 5 stars but it did fall apart a little taking it out of the pan.  I put it back together and am hoping for the best.  Thanks!

This cake has a wonderful flavor.  The texture is very dense and heavy.  I made this cake for Easter and we could only eat small pieces due to the denseness.  Not really sure if I'll make this again.  I'm still looking for a strawberry flavored cake that has more of a light and fluffy consistency.

This cake was incredibly delicous and moist! I came across this recipe after my son asked for a strawberry birthday cake. I used the two layers of cake to form Patrick the Starfish from SpongeBob Squarepants.

This was good. Made it for some friends and they all seemed to really enjoy it. I don't make cakes from scratch very often, I found this one very dense. Is that how they're supposed to be? Doesn't matter, it was still very, very good. I used 1/2 Cool whip,1/2 cream cheese, 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 cup milk for frosting. Topped with fresh strawberries. Looked great, tasted great. Thanks!

This is probably the best strawberry cake I’ve ever had. My little sister was adamant to have strawberry, which I’ve never attempted (mostly because I don’t like strawberry cakes) but this one was delicious and only a little putzy. It’s moist and fluffy, and the gelatin and pureed strawberries really give it a good flavor. I didn’t have cake flour on hand, but I looked up a recipe for substituting it with all-purpose flour and corn starch and it worked just fine. Excellent cake, especially with a good cream cheese frosting

Made these in cupcakes for a baby shower there are wonderful! Great strawberry flavor. I have yet to find a strawberry cake from scratch that is this easy and has a great strawberry flavor! I used fresh strawberries not frozen. I kept the purée in refrigerator until ready to use. Follow directions exactly on this recipe. It won’t disappoint!

Way too sweet.  I kept thinking there was too much sugar with the jello so I added about a quarter cup less.  It was still too much.  I needed a pink scratch cake to make a "Neopolitan" cake, and the colour is perfect.  Even has a nice strawberry flavour.

Awful cake! Don't waste your time. I think the awful taste came from the Jello. I wish I had trusted the negative reviews rather than the raving ones.

Four stars with changes. I did all the popular changes, folded in egg whites, decreased sugar etc.  Even with decreasing the sugar it was too sweet for me. It needs some salt to even out the depth of flavor and curb the sweetness.  Cakes with jello are very dense and I do think folding the egg whites in helped.  It's a delicate cake, though.  I might try it this recipe again with more changes.

Excellent. I sifted flour first, then measured. Still not a super airy cake, but who cares when it tastes this good!!? Even better on day 2. Note: use frozen unsweetened strawberries for puree or it will be too sweet. Also adding a layer of the unsweetened strawberry puree between layers makes it!! As as much as possible!! Lol

The jello made the cake slightly gummy in the very center, but the flavor was good, and everyone who had it liked it

Didn’t have cake flour, so I subbed it with all purpose and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. Came out really well. Man child loved it and he’s super picky!

This cake is moist and flavorful. My husband is always asking to bake one for him. I substitute white sugar for raw sugar and while milk for almond milk since I am lactose intolerant and the recipe works just as well as the original. I like to add in different flavors to the icing such as lime or lemon extract to spicy up the cake a bit.

I made this cake only I beat the egg whites stiff and folded them in at the end. I paired it with a strawberry whipped cream/cream cheese frosting. It was a perfect compliment for this cake. Will absolutely make again

This recipe is amazing! I made it for my daughter's 4th birthday party and everyone raved! Even had a 10 year old boy tell me later that was the best cake he ever had in life lol. I didn't have sweetened strawberries so I added 1-2 Tbs of powdered sugar to fresh. I also only did like half of gelatin. I will definitely make again!

The cake is very, very dense. I followed the recipe to as it is explained with all measurements as is. It was not moist at all. I did not make any alterations. But the frosting I made was the bomb! I was super excited about this since its summer! I was looking for a light, fluffy summer cake. :( I definitely sifted the flour and then measured.  No idea why it turned out this way.

A good cake, but dense if you don’t sift the flour before measuring and lacking authentic strawberry flavor. I chalk that up to the jello.

This cake was a hit with my easy to please family, however, I'm a little more critical. I made it into 3 layers. The flavor was good. But it was pretty dense (I DID NOT sift the flour). I'm thinking it was probably the jello since I never sift. Btw, I used an all natural jello. I also cut the sugar down by a half cup. 2 cups seemed like just too much (especially since the jello is full of sugar), and I was right. I should have cut back a whole cup. But, some people like super sweet. To me, it was. Also, I finely chopped fresh strawberries for the puree instead of frozen sweetened. I really like how it turned out, little chunks of strawberries throughout. I used the same for the filling and topping after draining them. And I used almond milk. My kids had a lot of fun helping me make this cake. I filled it and frosted it with a whip cream made with 3 cups heavy whipping cream, 1 package strawberry jello powder and 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar (which I also cut back on the amount called for lol) whipped with chilled beaters and a chilled bowl. All in all, I recommend this cake. It has a great strawberry flavor, especially when fresh strawberries are baked in, spread between the layers with strawberry whipped cream and spread over the top with whole strawberries and the strawberry whipped cream. 4 stars for flavor and ease and deducted 1 for density.

Unlike most other reviewers, I prefer a moist dense cake, which is what I got. That's what a 'from-scratch, home-made' cake should be like. If I want store-bought or boxed mix consistencies, I buy those... Kept the cake un-iced and served with left over strawberry puree and  dollops of whipped cream... My family and I enjoyed this flavourful, pretty pink treat! Will make again for sure.

Loved this cake! I used the recipe as is, but took the advice of sifting the flour into a measuring cup. It turned out perfectly.

Tall, pretty, and delicious cake!  I was skeptical about trying it based on so many negative reviews but decided to go for it anyway, and was well pleased with the results.  I did not experience any more of a dense texture than with many other scratch recipe cakes.  I beat the butter, sugar, and dry gelatin for about 5 minutes!  And beat in the vanilla and  the un-pureed strawberries (and a little gel food color ) before beating in the eggs instead of adding them at the end.  Other modifications I made included using 3c. sifted flour, reduced sugar to 1 1/2c.,  increased baking powder to 1T.,  3 Jumbo eggs (that's the size I had), used 2% milk and reduced the amount to 3/4c.  and vanilla to 1 1/2t., and added 1/2t. salt (since I used unsalted butter) to balance the sweetness.   The batter was so light and fluffy before baking but these cakes don't rise, probably because of the gelatin and strawberries.  All in all, a tall, tasty, and  impressive 3-layer strawberry cake that I will make again!   Thank you

Wow, ppl loved it. 

I forgot the jello; didn't seem to matter except my cake was not pink. Cut down sifted flour to 2.25 cups. Cut down the sugar to 1.25c, and I felt it was still too sweet.  Only used 3 eggs and I did not separate. However, I was super careful about aerating the mixture:  spent 4 min creaming the egg and butter, then a couple more at a faster speed (a la Alton brown gold cake recipe).  I added the eggs prebeaten and very slowly. I premixed the vanilla, puree (actually used preserve), and milk. This I alternated with the  dry ingredients. 

My cake was fluffy and super moist. I did get a couple comments that it reminded ppl of baNana bread(?!)

I wanted to try a cake with gluten free flour so one of my family could eat cake and not just the icing.  I followed the recipe to the letter. From the looks of the top of the baked layers, which tested done,  I thought it may be more near a pound cake consistency (which would have been fine).  However, when we sliced and served it, it was so strange: 'damp' layers and not at all delicious.  This was my first try with gluten free flour. does everything baked with it turn out like this?

It was great!  I didn't add any sugar to the puree of strawberries and I separated the eggs and beat the whites first but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.
Used a strawberry glaze and whipped cream...

Tbh, I didn't make it as a cake. I was planning on a strawberry brownie recipe, but it called for a pre-made cake mix- never as good as made from scratch stuff, in my opinion- so when I found this recipe, I was overjoyed. The cake batter before I had even added in the rest of my final recipe was delicious, and I'll certainly be using this recipe when I make regular strawberry cake as well. Awesome stuff!

I followed the directions perfectly and the cake tastes great. Also it is moist.
I'm giving it 4 stars because even though it was good, and moist; it fell apart when getting it out of the pan.
Thank goodness for icing because I could hide the booboos of the cake

This is the first cake I’ve made that has fallen in quite some time. I’m not sure where I went wrong, I followed the directions to a tee.

My son wanted to make a strawberry cake. I found this recipe, which had lots of positive reviews. 

The cake took longer than expected to cook so that it wasn't raw. The edges have a burnt taste and the cake fell apart when I removed it from the pans. 

The flavour is very fake tasting. I will not attempt this recipe again and I do not recommend making it!

My grandson requested a "strawberry cake" for his ninth birthday.  I had never made a strawberry cake.  This cake was easy to make and was a hit not only with my grandson but with older and younger guests as well.  I used a butter cream frosting.  My granddaughter has requested it for her next birthday.

Great recipie. Followed directions. Came out wonderful. The only thing i changed was i used fresh strawberries to make a puree so i can make a sweet cake but not too sweet from what i was reading on other reviews.  I'm defiantly making this for my daughters birthday party :)

You can use raspberry  jello as well. Also make sure the cake is cooked all the way to keep it from falling. I skipped the actual fruit once and it still worked, so have fun!

This is now my go to recipe for strawberry cake! It was super moist while remaining light and fluffy.  I strained half the strawberry purée so as to have less seeds in the batter (I was making cupcakes). The cupcakes were for my sister's bridal shower; she and everyone who attended loved these cupcakes l.

Amazing cake and all from scratch. I make my own cake flour with 1c all purpose flour to 2T corn starch ratio. I used homemade bourbon bean vanilla. And I took the recommendation from another review to separate the egg whites, beat them to soft peaks, and fold them in at the end before baking. 
I made a cake and cupcakes and these were GONE, even sitting next to a to-die-for chocolate cake. 
The cake, I made with two layers, separated by leftover strawberries mixed with homemade strawberry jam, sealed by delicious white vanilla buttercream icing. I topped the cake with 3 or 4 chocolate covered strawberries and a handful of chocolate cake truffles, also covered in semisweet and milk chocolate to fill in the gaps. 
Heavenly!

For those of you that didn't like using the traditional jello, there is a new all natural jello that uses strawberry juice. I tried it and made cupcakes. The cake was not as pink compared to using the traditional jello,  and it was somewhat dense, but it came out moist. I wish it was a little more fluffy, but I was glad it didn't come out like a muffin.

I made this for my daughters birthday and although it was my first strawberry flavored cake I am a seasoned cake maker. I was not very impressed with this cake, it was good but I wouldn't use this recipe again. It was dense even though I sifted my cake flour and then measured it. Also,  I separated the yolks and whipped the egg whites before incorporating it into the batter. I'm more of a fan of light and fluffy cakes and unfortunately this just didn't do it for me. My daughter was happy with it so I gave it 3 stars.

I LOVED this recipe. I made a few changes to it like using fresh strawberries instead of frozen; and separating and folding in the egg whites and adding a 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I didn't read the method so I of course followed my norm. Ample sugar too since I'm not eating it lol, well maybe the small one. Also made strawberry frosting to go with it.

My only complaint was that it took WAY longer to bake than the recipe anticipated. Other than that, I liked the density, and paired with strawberry flavoured icing, it was a hit!

My daughter wanted a cake that was "pretty and different" for her birthday, so we gave this a shot. It was a huge hit!
I cut the sugar to 1 3/4 cups (no more is needed), used oil instead of butter, and separated the eggs. I whipped the egg whites first, and transferred them to another bowl, then followed the instructions, adding in the whipped egg whites at the very end. 
I baked this in two round cake pans. Then I made more strawberry puree and whipped two cups of Rich's Whip with some of the strawberry puree and half a package of strawberry jello. I spread a thin layer of the strawberry-flavored cream and the remaining puree on top of the first cake, and put the second cake on top of that. I used the rest of the cream to decorate the top and sides of the cake. It came out beautiful and delicious!

I am a chef and Baker and am constantly looking for new recipies.            
   I have made this cake in the past and everyone falls in love with it. The only changes that I have made aside from the sifted flour measuring as others have mentioned is the strawberry puree. I use fresh strawberries instead of frozen and puree them in my processer. 
   This cake is a wonderful strawberry cake one of the best I have found so much so that it is about to become my wedding cake as of tomorrow ??

I made this as a birthday cake for my husband, and he loved it!  I found the cake to be a little dense and it didn't rise very much, so the layers were quite thin.  The flavor was absolutely stellar, though.  We just moved and I don't have a blender yet, so I made the strawberry puree by putting the frozen strawberries in a freezer bag and mashing to a pulp with a rolling pin.  I was nervous about that part but it seemed totally fine in the end.  I also made an icing out of Cool-Whip, cream cheese, and a bit of leftover strawberry puree.   I found the bake time to be way too short, and the cake needed an extra ten minutes in the oven before the knife came out clean.  I was worried this would dry the cake out but it was moist and delicious!

I made this and it is wonderful!  Took the advice of some reviewers and seperated egg whites and added them at the end. Cake came out perfect. No other charges were made. Will add strawberries on top tomorrow,  didn't have fresh strawberries tonight. My husband says it's a five for flavor and texture. So proud of myself and this recipe!! Thanks for sharing this with us!

It doesn't make a pretty colored cake at all. I even added extra puréed berries, and it still didn't have a pretty color. I was really not wanting to add any food color to this because of natural preferences. So if you are looking for a cake with more color, you will have to add food coloring to get it. The strawberry flavor is not strong either.

My husband requested strawberry lemonade cake for his birthday. It's easy to make, delicious and moist. I tweaked the recipe a bit by substituting lemon flavored gelatin for the strawberry. I also baked it in a 14" square pan, decreasing the temp to 335 and increasing the baking time to about 50 minutes to prevent too much mounding in the middle during the rise.

I made the cake using the exact ingredients, the only thing I did different was I made my own strawberry puree with fresh strawberries.  It was awesome!  Best cake ever!  Brought it to a dinner party and the hostess asked if she could keep the leftovers for a dinner she was having the following evening!

Turn out perfect. I didn't sift the regular white flour and  added the left over strawberries to the cream cheese frosting.... so delicious!  Thanks for sharing

This is a beautiful strawberry cake, not only the color but the taste also.It's very hard to find a strawberry cake from scratch but this is a good one.

Made this recipe yesterday for a little girls birthday, she had requested a pink strawberry cake, with fresh strawberries in between the layers, chocolate cream cheese buttercream and pink sprinkles! 
Was so happy when I found this recipe! I did some of the modifications in other reviews. I found all natural strawberry jello (no preservatives, artificial colors or flavors, actual Jell-O brand), decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups, added 1 tsp salt, separated the eggs adding the egg whites whipped into stiff peaks at the end. I used fresh strawberries to make the puree, adding a bit of sugar, letting them sit out a couple of hours then pureed them in the food processor. Do be sure to measure your cake flour AFTER sifting. 
I did increase the recipe by half (though the above mentioned modifications are for the original recipe as written) and made a 9 inch 3 layer cake and 8 cupcakes. 
The taste is amazing! I was a bit worried after refrigerating that the cake seemed dense, but I set it out a couple of hours before serving and it's perfect! I can hardly wait to make it again with just a plain cream cheese buttercream or maybe stabilized whipped cream and fresh berries. I think it would be a perfect summer time cake!

I have to give this recipe only two stars.  I was glad to finally find a strawberry cake recipe that didn't call for boxed strawberry cake. I followed the directions as listed and took some helpful hints from other reviewers about measuring the flour after it had been sifted. When I mixed up the batter I was really excited because I tasted it and it had great flavor. I tried to make cupcakes instead of a cake and the results were basically a disaster. There wasn't enough leavening so each cupcake had a huge dimple in the middle, which I could overlook because I was going to frost them, but the texture of the cake was also off. It wasn't dense as some other reviewers have complained about, but it was gritty, like I could taste the individual grains from the jello.  This was incredibly disappointing overall. I'm giving two stars because it actually has great strawberry flavor, but that's about all it has going for itself. I won't be trying this again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I made this cake last night. My only complain was that it was too sweet. I'll definitely reduce the sugar next time to 1 1/2 c of sugar instead. Didn't even put frosting because it was so sweet. Kids thought so also. I also used fresh strawberries instead. Other than that, good cake.

Great recipe! I did adjust a little, I used sugar free strawberry gelatin. I made this cake twice. The first time I used the recommended jello and did not realize I should have sifted my flour first..... this made a heavier cake than I anticipated. Second time around I used sugar free jello and sifted my flour and added a little more baking powder, Which resulted in a lighter and moist cake ?? I am not an expert at baking but was able to successfully bake a beautiful and tasty  cake that our family truly enjoyed!

This recipe is probably the best recipe I've ever used. The cake was so moist, and the layers were perfect. The cake itself had the most magnificent strawberry flavor also. Will be making this cake again soon

Great recipe, however I'm not sure what I may have done wrong but the batter spilled all over my stove. The cake did come out eventually but I just ate the pieces. I'm going to attempt to make it again in the near future.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written but the cake did not turn out right for some reason.  The next time I make the cake I am going to use half a stick of butter and 3 eggs instead of 4.  I didn't have a problem with the cake itself tasting like jello as mentioned in other reviews and I also used fresh strawberries mashed up a few hours before I mixed the ingredients together.  Even though there was more butter used in the cake than needed the taste was good and my icing came out tasty.  When I make my next cake I will also chill the icing so that it doesn't run after being freshly made.  I also saw another idea to add cool whip so I will try that also.

This recipe was easy to follow but my cake did not turn out well. It was extremely dense and the center took forever to be done, while the outside browned too quickly. I could have created an icing to cover it up but it tasted extremely “floury" and I did not want to serve to my family, nor waste anymore ingredients.  No bueno

I would suggest that the problem with this recipe is the ratio of fat and sugar to flour, not the flour itself.  There is a LOT of butter, plus the 4th egg, plus the fat in the whole milk.  In addition, the sugar dampens a cake - not only is this a lot of sugar, there is sugar in the jello plus sugar added to the strawberries.  Also, butter itself makes a denser cake, as does adding fruit.  There is no way this can be a "light and fluffy" cake.  However it could be delicious in its own way.

I loved the fact that this recipe used freeze dried strawberries instead of the gelatin that most others do.  I followed the recipe except I took the advice of another review and used 1/3 c. of the sugar to grind with the strawberries into a powder.  The family loved this and it is a keeper!  Thank you Candice for coming up with this.

AMAZING CAKE! Made it for my sons 5th Birthday and it was a hit. It was iced with a dark chocolate icing, which was a perfect fit and not overly sweet. The cake had a genurine strawberry flavor. Definitely using this again.

I followed the directions precisely.  It was a dense cake.  I served it with pureed strawberries drizzled over the top in order to increase flavor.

This Recipe is really good. Like another responder, I too separated the egg whites and whipped them until it was frothy. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of strawberry puree, I figured the extra couldn't hurt :) I bake and cook quit a bit and this will be one I will make in the future. Everyone Loved it. The Cake is good without any topping. But, for my 3 year old's birthday she wanted a strawberry cake. I added my cream cheese frosting and it seem to be quit the hit. I had made these into cupcakes and cooked them for 17 minutes over a baking stone @350degrees. So, if your looking for a tasty cake/cupcake then give this a try, you won't be disappointed.

This was an epic fail.  I followed directions EXACTLY as in the printed recipe AND the video.  Even went out to the store again to purchase frozen strawberries, since they were preferred.  This cake fell...and I don't mean kind of.  It was awful.  I threw it out.

I have made this cake several times and it is always a hit! It is one of my most requested cakes! I have made wedding cakes and birthday cakes with this recipe and turns out great every time! I have tried several other recipes but not one of them give you that rich strawberry taste! Make sure you sift the cake flour and then measure it. My batter is always fluffy, but I use an electric mixer and not my kitchen aid. It tends to be runny and doesn't rise as high when I use my kitchen aid mixer. Might just be a preference though.

As a starter note, I bake only gluten free and I substituted Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 Gluten Free Baking Flour for the regular flour. I made this cake for a colleague and I have not yet heard back what she thought of it. I made two batches for a three layer cake for her, leaving me a single layer. It is dense, as many reviewers noted, but I'm not sure if mine was dense due to the flour I used, since even sifted GF flour still tends to result in dense results. I found the cake soft and moist, and I think it's delicious. The only thing I noticed was  that I had to increase the baking time to accommodate the flour about 10 minutes. I had made this cake before for my strawberry loving brother who loved it, which I neglected to review then.

I made this cake for my daughters 3rd birthday party. The cake itself was delicious! I do agree with the other rates based on the density of the cake, but that wasn't a huge problem for me. I would highly recommend frosting this with a buttercream frosting that doesn't contain sugar though. My child was bouncing off of the walls after this cake.

I followed the recipe exactly, made for a Birthday cake. I will definitely make it again  though it lacked the Strawberry flavor I desired. Next time I'll substitute Strawberry nectar for the whole milk and sift then measure my flour (a suggestion I read from another review) All in all great recipe.

Great recipe, I followed it exactly and it came out perfectly. It took a bit longer to cook than the 30 min and I was afraid it would burn but it didn't. My family raved about it. I didn't have the sweetened frozen strawberries so I used frozen unsweetened and just added sugar.

I made this and did some of the tricks others say to do like sift the floor then measure and whip the egg whites and fold in but this cake was still so dense. The flavor was good but the cake itself was horrible. Very disappointed.

This is my all time favorite strawberry cake, this recipe seems to make its way into our home at least once a year. It's great for special occasions and birthdays and goes very well with a cream cheese buttercream frosting. I used a standing mixer to combine the ingredients and followed closely to the recipe. I wanted a rectangular cake so I chose to use a nine by thirteen glass Pirex dish to bake the cake. It did take a bit longer to bake, about 45 minutes, but it turned out very well. While mixing I noticed the batter seemed a bit too thick and gooey but it turned out fine, nothing to worry about. The cake was moist and delicious but a bit on the sweet side for me, my family sure loved it though. Lots of other reviews complain about the density but this can be fixed by measuring out the flour after it has been sifted. Overall I absolutely love this cake and would definitely recommend i t to all other strawberry lovers. Best of luck with this recipe!

I have made this twice.  It was wonderful.  My whole family loves it.  The first time I made it was for a birthday party and it was a hit.  Be sure to  measure your sifted flour.  I also used fresh strawberries instead of frozen.

Yes I made  a couple of changes,  I used three teaspoons
of baking powder and added fresh strawberries to the filling.  I used the whipped cream cream cheese Frosting  so it would not be overly sweet, it was delicious , gave half the cake to one of my daughters, have not heard from her as of yet.

The family loved the cake. I made it for my great granddaughters birthday. Only complaint was that vanilla frosting made it too sweet, so next time I will try a whipped cream frosting. Family wants me to try layering some sliced strawberries in the center.

It came out dense even though I pre-sifted the flour before measuring. I didn't appreciate the flavor, it was too sweet. I was expecting a more subtle natural strawberry flavor.

Great cake and easy to make.  The recipe is quite forgiving - even if the texture isn't perfect it still looks and tastes very good. I understand the comments, because I have made the cake many times now, and gotten different results.  But if you follow the recipe exactly you wont have any problem.  The three biggest variables are:  amount of flour, amount of strawberries, and the cooking time.  Flour:  the amount the recipe calls for is amount sifted.  I have tried not sifting the flour and instead calculated how much  less nonsifted flour to use, and I got a moist runny cake.  When I sifted and used the correct amount flour, the texture is perfect.  Do not use any more than the 1/2 cup of the strawberry puree or it will add too much moisture.  Furthermore, you do not need to sweeten the strawberries - the cake is plenty sweet enough.   Lastly, the cake cooks very quickly, so be careful not to overcook.  25  minutes is more than enough, just make sure to leave in the pans, inverted on a cooking rack, for at least 10 minutes.  Follow these suggestions and the cake will be absolutely perfect.  Once the cake is cooled, I frosted with a 'Simple and Delicious Buttercream Frosting' from this site (to note, I modified this recipe by adding an extra cup of confectioners sugar).

This cake was very moist and it was enjoyed by guests. I followed other reviews and whipped the egg whites first, then blended the egg whites in. I also used an angel cake pan and it turned out beautifully. I gave it a 4 star rating because I thought it tasted more like jello than strawberries. Just my preference.

Seriously disappointed in this recipe. I've made it twice, and it comes out too dark on the outside, dense, dried out and too mealy/crumbly. It's easy enough to followI tried baking for less time the second time I baked it, but it was not cooked thru. Texture is wrong.

I have made this cake many times now. Last night I took it to a birthday party, there were four cakes at the party, but not one bite of the strawberry cake was left. Wonderful recipe and very easy to make. I put homemade strawberry jam in between the layers with a border of Strawberry Icing from scratch. Then I top it with Icing and cover the sides.

I followed the recipe exactly, making sure to blend every thing well. It turned out perfect! I read several of the reviews and then opted to just follow the recipe and then modify based on the first try. I don't believe there is any need to modify! The key is to mix everything together well. I used my stand mixer and that helped. My husband is a huge strawberry cake fan and I will be making this again! Note: I used a 13x9 aluminum pan and I think I over baked it a bit. I pulled it out at 40 mins but I probably could have pulled it out around 30 minutes.

I really dislike the use of the gelatin and the cream cheese icing I used. Maybe the option of red food coloring to give it the bright pink color and stewing fresh strawberries to bring out more flavor will be better than using gelatin.

Hi, well I had the same density issue as everyone else; but didn't notice the review which said measure the flour after it was sifted until the cake was already in the oven.  Taste was phenomenal though!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes. They turned out delicious, everyone liked them and no one complained about them being dense.  I did understand the difference between measuring sifted flour and sifting after measuring but I was lazy and sifted after I measured. They really aren't that dense.  It makes me wonder if some people are using all-purpose flour instead of cake flour.  I will definitely keep this recipe and it will be my  go to recipe for strawberry cake or cupcakes.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!! Amazing and so super simple!! Made this for my daughters 3rd birthday as she LOVES strawberries and this delivered that delicious strawberry factors! I didn't sift the flour as lost my sifter so I  just used regular flour and it still came out most and delicious! It was denser but in a real cake-from-scratch- kinda way.  I'm making it again right now!

The flavor of this cake is good and I was glad to find a strawberry cake recipe.  The cook time was longer than the recipe said, so I wonder if the type of pan used makes a difference (i.e. metal vs non stick or glass). At 25 minutes, it was still all batter in the center and at 35 still a little gooey in the middle. So I had to bake 40 minutes which caused it to brown a bit much around the edges. I used non stick pans so would likely reduce the heat to 325 next time.  I made an icing with thawed frozen strawberries, powdered sugar and vanilla extract, but it was so sweet with this rich cake, we scraped most of it off. Also, this is a very dense, rich cake. If I make it again, I may make it as a bundt cake instead. I am thinking as a bundt cake, with just a light strawberry or chocolate glaze, it would be perfect. Thanks for the recipe as I will try it again.

I made this for a birthday cake - first time I'd ever made a cake from scratch - It was delicious!!! I used the tips from reviewers ... I made the strawberry puree from fresh strawberries, added a thin layer of the puree between layers with the icing, mixed the egg whites separately, and measured after sifting. I topped with the basic cream cheese frosting. This was a huge hit and is now what will be requested from all my kids for their birthdays.

This is a very pretty cake! There should be no problems with this easy recipe! Cream butter, sugar, and jello until you think its had enough, them cream it a heck of a lot more! The color starts out a deep, almost toxic pink, becoming paler as it nears the point of being ready for additions.  I made sure all ingredients were room temperature. Eggs added one at a time, and stirred gently to incorporate. Milk mixture and flour mixture added as indicated, and stirred. Texture is perfect. Moisture content is very good. Used two 9" pans, for a beautiful cake frosted in vanilla cream cheese. Delicious, sweet, but not overly so cake.  I will look into beefing up with more strawberries!

Changes I made. Wasn't thrilled about adding Jello in a "from scratch recipe". I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of Knox gelatine instead of the Jello,  Used 1 1/2 teaspoons of  natural strawberry flavouring, skipped the vanilla. Added a small amount of red food colouring paste. As many others had suggested I separated the eggs. Whipped the egg white and folded them in last. I ended up with a beautiful cake that my husband loved and added it to the " will bake again " list.

I decided to make a cake on a whim. Normally I read reviews to see if there is anything I would like to do differet. This cake was dense and did not rise well.

While the texture was on point, I found it to be too sweet and the jello gave it a very artificial tangy taste. Won't make it again.

I would give this a 5 but like many have stated here already it's a very heavy cake. 
It is very moist  and that is it's redeeming quality I believe.

After 10 minutes in the oven it practically exploded out of the pan and most of it ended on the bottom of the oven. The cake that did cook and what was left in the pan was very tasty, but not usable. I have no idea what I did wrong. Can anyone enlighten me?

This cake was soooooooooooo good and happy. I mean I was dealing with pink the whole time and how can you not smile with pink everywhere? Made my own puree with fresh strawberries and since it called for sweetened puree i added a bit of sugar but I don't think it needed the extra sugar. Frosted with 2c p sugar, stick of butter and 3 tbls of puree that was enough to lightly frost a 2 layer cake.

Delicious and well worth the effort. I made two thinner cakes with cream cheese frosting and strawberries in the middle. Will definitely try again with homemade cream cheese frosting and juicy organic strawberries next time.

Very soft cake with a light pink colour. Don't know how well it holds for slicing in two. I layered it with leftover strawberry puree and strawberry mousse. Topped with whipped cream.
I felt that the strawberry flavour is not too strong in the cake itself.. It has more of a vanilla flavour. I used strawberry puree in the filling to enhance the strawberry flavour. Will use this recipe again. This also makes delightful cupcakes.

I made cupcakes with this recipe.  I too made the suggested changes - separated the eggs, cut the sugar to about 1 2 / 3 cup, sifted the flour first, and I cut the strawberry gelatin in half.  I baked the cupcakes for about 15 minutes, I erred on the side of slightly overcooking, and let them sit in the pan to cool.  My frosting was a basic cream cheese frosting, with a few tablespoons of the strawberry puree mixed in - tasted like strawberry ice cream.  My family loved these cupcakes.

The most delicious and popular cupcakes ever for me and my granddaughter, then 3.  We're on for Valentine's Day again this year. We froze some complete with frosting last February and they defrosted, still delicious, before Christmas.

I made this recipe into cupcakes because Valentine's Day is in just a few days and we wanted to share with my daughter's friends. I saw where someone said that they separated the eggs and whipped the whites before folding them into the batter. I did this, and, the result is light, fluffy and delicious! I don't usually like strawberry cakes because ones I've tried taste artificial, but, this one (pardon the pun...) takes the cake! I'm truly happy to have run across this recipe!

Overall, this is a pretty good cake. Good, not great.  I did follow the recipe to the letter.  The cake is very dense (very much like a pound cake.) I did use sifted cake flour, sifted the flour before measuring.  I won't use this recipe again...as a rather experienced cook/baker, I know there's better recipes out there.

Everyone loved the strawberry flavor and dense, moist texture of the cake.  I separated the egg whites and added an extra white, whipping them before adding them to the batter. It was definitely not a 10 min prep but well worth the effort.  I made a butter and cream cheese frosting with vanilla extract and fresh strawberry puree. I made mine in a 9x13 cake pan and it took about 40-45 mins to cook @ 350.

This is an amazing cake-everyone loves it. Moist and fairly dense. I made multiple layers for a tiered cake and it was great for stacking because it's not very fluffy. Make sure you sift the flour and THEN measure it.

I added 1 tsp. salt.  I also made a mistake by using only 1/2 cup of butter (one stick) instead of the 1 cup it called for.  I used a butter cream frosting.   The cake turned out delicious.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was the most amazing cake ever. A complete hit at my daughter's 6th birthday. My only advice is to double the recipe. The layers are pretty thin, and four layers would be great for a large party, but perfect just as written for a small gathering.

Very tasty strawberry cake!  I added extra strawberries to the cake, and served with vanilla icing and a strawberry sauce...delicious!

Very disappointed by this recipe.  The taste was fantastic, but the texture was a bit hard and dry.  I sifted my CAKE flour, beat my egg whites to soft peaks separate, scaled back a bit on sugar, and baked in three 9" round pans.  I thought I was set up for success after so many recommended those changes.  Everyone thought it tasted good, but the texture was not fluffy.  I used cream cheese frosting that paired well and put strawberry puree (fresh strawberries) between the layers that I thickened up with cornstarch.

I have made this recipe quite a few times. I really like it, however I do think it is a little too sweet. (Who knew such a thing existed) but I think the sweetness overpowers the strawberry flavor. Maybe try 1.5 C sugar instead of 2 cups.

This cake turned out beautiful and delicious!  I added 2 tbls. of vinegar to my milk, cut back the baking powder to 2tsp. and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  Cut each layer in half and filled with a homemade strawberry filling, then frosted with cream cheese frosting and decorated with designs from a pink sugar sheet.

I made this cake for my daughter's first birthday last year and it was a hit with my very large family. It was dense and delicious. I made it into a tiered cake with buttercream frosting and covered in fondant. I am going to use this recipe again to make cake pops for my nieces upcoming wedding shower.

The only change I made was to separate the yolk and egg whites. I put the egg whites in at the end. The cake is delicious and I will be adding this to my book if recipes!

I made this cake for my sister's birthday party and everyone thought it was yummy. It was worth the work to make it and I thought it was very girly and fun. The only thing I didn't do that the recipe said was to strain the seeds out of the puree. It was a lot of work to make sure there wasn't any seeds in the puree so I gave up and put the puree in the batter seeds and all. It was easier and I didn't notice any seeds in the finished cake. Overall a great recipe that's great for girly-girls!

I made this and it was so fun!!!!!  When putting the cakes in the oven I accidentally dropped the pan and some batter got in the oven.  This was a set back, but luckily my older cousin was there to the rescue.  The cakes turned out a little thinner than I had expected so that was upsetting, but I still think it will taste great.  I made this for my turning five year old brother and I added some Lego decorations.  It turned out great.

This cake was reeeeeally dense but I didn't have cake flour so that's probably the reason why.  I did try to substitute by adding some cornstarch in ....didn't work, cake was still HEAVY.  As far as the taste? WONDERFUL! The jello didn't make it too sweet for me but as every good cook & baker knows...you TASTE as you add your ingredients so it isn't overwhelming for the finished product. I made a strawberry cream cheese frosting and added strawberry puree to it and it came out great. Next time I will use cake flour but the cake was still very good! I may break it down to three cake pans instead of two as someone else suggested also.

After reading these reviews, I decided to make this cake anyway. It was so dense and almost rubbery.  
Followed the recipe exactly except separated the egg whites and whipped them as one review suggested.   I definitely won't be trying this one again.   I've been cooking a long time and was very disappointed in this cake.

Should have followed mother's advice..."never bake a cake for the first time if you plan on taking it somewhere".  I admit to being in a hurry as Easter was the next day, and so I didn't read the reviews. Had I done so my cake may have turned out better, or should I say, turned out at all. My cake fell apart just as another reviewer stated.  I did follow the recipe as stated, and the modifications others applied may have made the difference for me.

I don't think of myself as a very good baker... certainly not a veteran baker, but,  this cake was surprisingly simple and turned out awesome. I made it for my grandmother's birthday and it was a big hit. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from allrecipes.com.

My family and I loved this cake. I made it exactly as the recipe is and it turned out fantastic. Next time though I will use 3 cake pans. Recipe called for 2 pans although the picture is 3. It was too much batter for just 2 pans. Luckily I forgot to put the baking powder in :) so it did not rise over my 2 cake pans. Almost did but not quite.  Imagine if I had used the baking powder with just 2 pans...my oven would have been a mess. As it was though the cake turned out great. Thanks. Definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe except I didn't add the jello, and instead tripled the strawberry puree and added 1 cup of strawberry daiquiri mixer (non alcoholic). The cake came out fluffy and yummy. Make sure you sift the flour before measuring it into the batter, there is a difference. 
also- you don't have to have the eggs and milk at room temperature if you use a stand mixer, the friction from the attachment brings the ingredients to the right temperature (:

This is the best strawberry cake ever. I've made it twice, and both times they were a hit. First was for my daughter who wanted me to bake her strawberry cupcakes and bring them to her college for her birthday. She even had some stolen from their community fridge. The next event was Thanksgiving Day dinner. They were some of the desserts offered and I had to stash some away so my little ones could get a chance at them before they were all gone. The real hit came from my four-year old who doesn't like cakes (what are the odds). Well he ate the entire stash over time. For those who said that it didn't turn out right, I'd say follow the recipe to the letter. I forgot to add that this recipe does not call for salt. Salt is a very vital part of any cake recipe. I've always added salt both times I made this cake and it was perfect. Today, I followed the recipe and forgot the salt. Well needless to say, it does not have the same taste as before. It definitely felt like it was missing something (salt). So please add a teaspoon of salt in this recipe or it will taste off.

I made this recipe tonight with everything except the strawberry purée.  Without the purée it tasted very fake to me.  I think I am going to use a recipe with no jello in the ingredients.

It's easy to fix this recipe. To make it light and fluffy you simply have to separate the eggs when the recipe calls for the eggs just use the yellows then after everything else is in beat the whites separately until stiff peaks form. then fold the whites into the rest of the batter.

I made this for my husband for our anniversary.  I made it cherry instead of strawberry.  My husband loved it.  I thought it was too dense, however.  I did sift the flour and separated the eggs and added the stiff egg whites at the end.  I would make this cake again and put in only half of the jello powder.  I think that would rectify the problem with the density.

I made this cake last night... 2 Layers... I used the Recipe for Buttercream Frosting which actually consisted of no Butter at all... It called for Shortening... I got a lot of Positive Reviews on this cake & the frosting... Me personally I thought it was a little too sweet... But I had several people request it as one of their Birthday Cakes... I think it stood up well, wasn't too soft, so it would probably stack well... It was all in all a fun cake to make...

I'm afraid I did not have much success with this recipe. I did follow instructions exactly, but the cake came out gummy despite increasing the cook time by an hour. It could well have been an error on my part and/or a difference in the quality of ingredients as I am living in Brazil.

The cake was a bit dense. I followed the recipe but omitted 1/4 cup of flour and beat the egg whites separately. The cake still wasnt light and fluffy. To top it off I used Jello strawberry flavored gelatin and I dont like the chemically artificial taste of it. Tastes like I brought a store mix -.- next time I will look for a all natural from scratch recipe.

A dilemma indeed. I made this cake for my 33rd birthday, my first attempt at a real cake! And I flopped. I think I let the creamed butter and sugar wait too long, and get too soft before I added everything I was supposed to. I will reattempt soon. I also made this with a vanilla custard and chopped strawberry filling, and topped it with a lemonny meringue icing. The flavors were great but the cake rose about a quarter of an inch. Next time, I will ensure all my ingredients are at the proper temp and properly prepped.

Today is my husband's 30th!  I've never made Strawberry Cake, however,  this is his favorite.  I tried this recipe and utilized helpful suggestions from previous reviews such as separating the egg yolks and whites, using 3 three pans instead of two, and reducing the sugar.  My husband loves the cake; however,  I would have to agree with a lot of the other reviews.  I would have liked the cake to be a bit more fluffy.  It was indeed a tad dense. Oh well, the hubby loved it!

I followed the recipe as written, split into 2 9 in round pans and 25 minutes into baking, the cakes where bubbling over the side of the pans and still very soupy.

Everyone who's trid this swear the cake tastes like strawberry ice cream.  It was a little on the dense side, even after sifting the flour before measuring, but I was expecting it, and it still had a wonderful flavor.  Made cream cheese icing to go with and it really set off the flavor.

I made this cake on valentine's day. I didn't have any strawberries to reduce and add to the batter so I omitted it. I also used all purpose flour rather than cake flour. These changes aside, I didn't tweak the recipe amounts or anything. It was a great texture, and moist although it could have been moister if I hadn't left it in the oven those couple extra minutes. I used a dark chocolate mousse to fill and ice it, and it was to die for. I tried a strawberry cake recipe that only used fresh berries to give the cake flavor but it was bland and a little doughy. This one is in my keeper list for summery cakes now.

I made this cake yesterday. I think I added too much sugar. Otherwise I frosted it with CoolWhip and put it in the refrigerator to get cold. And it was AWESOME!  Next time I won't put so much sugar in my strawberries.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day, and it was a hit! Members of the family who usually do not eat fruit absolutely loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect. I used vanilla buttercream frosting in between layers, and on the outside. This made it that much better, with no cake left! I would certainly recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a fun and delicious cake!

I have never made a cake from scratch before and I have been baking for a long time. This cake has several steps and does take time. I strongly urge 1)check to be sure your baking powder is still active; 2)separating the eggs is the best way to add them--I separated the eggs and beat the yolks before adding; 3)fresh strawberry is great--I used 6 big ones and 1 TBSP of sugar in my food processor. I think the next time (and there will be a next time), I'll cut back the flour to 2 1/4 c. I also think I'll use real strawberries using my food processor. I didn't think the flavor was strawberry enough and don't want to buy strawberry extract (but will consider it). The cake was good but a little denser than I expected but received the A-OK from husband so it must be good since he isn't a real big cake eater. Also I read the reviews and someone suggested to freeze the cake before frosting and it was far and above better than Pam (LOL)! I will make this again with fresh baking powder. I am very pleased with my efforts and the result was better than I expected!

I don't even have to sifted the flour or separate eggs. It come out very light, fluffy and moist. Oh I change from whole milk to butter cream because I don't have whole milk.

i made this recipe for a cake and cupcakes and it turned out great. i filled the cake and frosted the cupcakes with strawberry mousse . it was not too strong or too sweet. it has a wonderfully light texture and a very nice color. i used fresh strawberry puree (i sprinkled a little sugar on the strawberries, left them for about an hour, pureed and sieved them). all my family loved it.

Because of the reviews, I was so confident in this recipe that I made it for my daughter's birthday party without first giving it a test. All I could taste was the gelatin.  I put more fresh strawberry puree than the suggested amount, but the gelatin flavor was still so overpowering.  I decided after reading several reviews to make 3 layers instead of 2 and it was still a little dense.  I didn't receive any complaints at the party, but no compliments either.  I take pride in my baking and was disappointed that this cake recipe didn't yield the results I'd expected. My 4 year old daughter loves "pink" cake enough that I will give it a second try, but definitely will make some modifications (much less gelatin, or maybe none, and more fresh strawberries)

This makes about 3 dozen cupcakes. 

I have baked a lot of cupcakes. A LOT. These taste delicious. They do not rise up well. They are very flat. If you know that going in, then go for it, because the taste is great. Fun twist, I used cherry instead of strawberry for the jello and the fruit and tossed in a fistful of chocolate chips. Yum.

I used this recipe to make Texas size cupcakes for Valentines Day.  I used baking Splenda instead of sugar.  I also used fresh strawberries pureed in the blender and 1% milk.  The cake was moist.

The texture was a tiny bit heavy, probably because of the gelatin.  Maybe strawberry koolaid would be better?  For cupcakes it was not a problem.  If using for cupcakes the tops raise to a nice very slightly rounded top which is perfect for icing. 

I would suggest using clear vanilla because the dark color muddied up the red and I had to use a little red food color to get it back to red-red.   

An idea would be to make mini-cupcakes and put one of those large specialty chocolate chips in the middle of each one, if you like that flavor combo, then drizzle the tops with melted chocolate.

I goofed!  My gelatin was hard when I opened the package and I'm not sure if it absorbed ok.   I tried to break it up.  I only had 2% milk on me.  Should the puréed strawberries been strained first after defrosting?  The cake looked real pretty but it was very dry. Very disappointed.  If anybody has an idea why I would love to know. It was for our 9 year olds bday.

This tasted better than I thought it would when I mixed it and put it into the oven, but it still wasn't anything to get excited about. First, the color was an awful pinkish gray. I really wished I had some food coloring to make it a little more pink or red. After it was baked, I found the strawberry flavor to be so subtle that it was almost not there. I also wished I had used a little more leavening in order to get more rise. The only thing that I like about this instead of simply making a boxed mix was that it has a lot less artificial flavorings and preservatives.

I have made this cake twice now. I followed directions to the letter . First time I split the sugar with 1/2 splenda half sugar . The whole cake was  flat, heavy. Just terrible it was barely 1 inch high. I through it out.. Next time I did use all sugar as per  recipe but I had to use all purpose flour as I didn't have cake & pastry on hand . This one came out better but it was not light and fluffy it was still heavy and very dry . I cooked it at 350 just till it was done , "the tooth pick came out clean". I don't know why but I just cannot get a scratch cake to come out as soft and light as a cake mix.. This is an expensive cake to make so I don't think I will try it again.. too bad because strawberry cake is so good.

Okay, I followed this recipe exactly and my cake was flat. I baked in 2 9in rounds. They rose and looked fluffy in the oven, but when I took them out, they got flat. The flavor was good, but was disappointed with the results. I ended up cutting the cakes and made a trifle instead.

I was really concerned at making this recipe since I live at a high altitude and was very pleasantly surprised to find it worked great! It didn't fall or anything! The only complaint I have is that it's a bit too sweet for traditional frosting and does much better with a glaze.

This was very good! I made a few changes though. 1. I didn't have cake flour so I used normal all purpose flower and 4 tsp of baking powder. I remeasured the flour after sifting like other viewers suggested. I also didn't have any gelatin so I omitted it completely and put in 1 cup of puree instead of 1/2.I put the entire batter in a 9x13 glass pan and cooked it for 40 minutes. It came out very delicious, slightly dense, but not enough to bother me or anyone who ate it. I also made a strawberry cream cheese icing for it using 4 oz cream cheese, about 1/4 cup pureed strawberries (strained to remove seeds), 2 tbs heavy cream and 1 cup of confectioner's sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my second time to make this cake. I make it using the modifications of separating the eggs and pre-sifting the cake flour before measuring, as others have mentioned. If you have clear vanilla, I'd recommend using it, as the tablespoon does darken the cake somewhat.  I should have greased and floured the pans rather than using baking spray the second time--the cake tends to stick on the bottom, so it didn't come out as nicely as I would have liked. (I may try parchment next time.)  Because I used a 13 x 9 x 2 pan, the baking time was longer, but no problem. 

We love the cake, although I would rather find a recipe without the gelatin--something about that texture in a cake bothers me, yet until I do, it will remain my go-to recipe for my husband's birthday cake.

I was skeptical to try this recipe..seems like there are both good and bad reviews - however, I tried it and did what other posters suggested...cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups, only 2oz of geletin, and whipped the egg whites separately. I also added lemon zest.  I used this recipe for cake balls, so I didn't mind the density of the cake. Crumbled it and mixed in just a little bit of strawberry frosting then dipped in dark chocolate.  Tasted pretty darn close to chocolate covered strawberry!  Will definitely add to my recipe box!  - Bobbie W., Kansas

hi, 
Made this cake yesterday for my friends daughter's 2nd birthday.It came out great.Everybody loved it. I followed the instructions carefully.The Jelly adds the punch to the cake. Could do with a little more of it.IIf this cake had only fresh strawberry puree,then it would not have got the strawberry flavour.I used whipped cream strawberry icing in between the layers and buttercream icing with a little of the strawberry jelly for piping the icing on the cake and it went well with it.I have attached a picture of  the cake.Fantastic cake.Will keep making it.Thank you very much for the recipe.

the major problem for me was the jello, it made the entire cake taste artificial to me. After a couple of days however the taste disappeared. I am still looking for that perfect cake with no jello made from scratch, have not yet found it though....

This is a great recipe.  I substituted 3/4 cup of the cake flour for AP flour.  I am not a fan of cakes made with all cake flour as it reminds me of a box mix.

I made this for my son's fourth birthday. I made a batch and a half and filled both a 10" x 10" x 2" and a 6" x 6" x 2" pan and had some left over. I made an Italian merengue buttercream to go with it. Delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I made some changes. I did not have any cake flour, so I used all purpose. I'm vegetarian, so I used agar powder instead of gelatin. I reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cup. I also used skim milk, as opposed to whole milk. It took 20 minutes in the oven, and made 36 cupcakes. Unfrosted, it's delicious with tea. Thank you; going into my recipe box!

I have used this recipe several times and compared it to the box cake mix and making it from scratch is by far much better.  I made Guava Cream Cheese Cupcakes with this recipe and it was very, very good.  This one is a keeper.

My 9 year old found this reipe and stayed in the kitchen supervising ME and we accomplished a great result. We can`t find powdered gelatine where we live so substituted with flan mix instead.Cut back by 1/2 gup of sugar too as we had extra sugar from the flan mix. Made 3 times and each time no crumbs are ever left even the cat begs for more. Thanks for sharing

This recipe worked for me, I followed it exactly the only thing I did that wasn't mentioned in the recipe is measured my flour from "sifted" flour. That means I sifted some flour and then measured out the amount of flour needed for the recipe from the flour already sifted. Came out moist and full of strawberry flavor and everyone I gave a piece to loved it!  The thing I appreciate about this recipe verses other ones I've tried is that it didn't have an artificial taste to it and the strawberry flavor was pronounced very well although next time I will add a little more strawberry to bump it a little because I love strawberries but overall it's not necessary, it tasted like a fresh strawberry cake from scratch which is what I was looking for.   
Another thing about this cake is that it is best a day later I found the flavor came out more the next day verses the day made.

Fabulous! I had all of the ingredients except for the strawberry puree, so I added a little extra jello mix and voila, perfection! I made them into cupcakes for my son and whipped up some vanilla frosting to top them off. I can't wait to try it with the puree next time!

What a wonderful recipe.  This cake turned out amazing, I used 2 9 inch pans, next time I will use 3 8 inch instead, as the tops kind of fell.  I made home made cake flour as I didn't have a box of it.  This is a keeper, thank you.

This cake had a great flavor, but yes, was extremely dense even after measuring the sifted flour and beating the egg whites separately, but I brought this to a baby shower today and got rave reviews about the flavor. I will probably make this cake again. Also, it's a WONDERFUL cake if you need to sculpt it! Dense cakes are great for that! It was not dry at all either like some people were saying. Don't over bake. Dense, but VERY moist! Delicious!

Even though I tried everything in other reviews to help keep this cake from being too dense (sifting flour before measuring; separating egg whites, whipping, and adding at end; and using 3 layers), the cake still came out so solid and dense- almost hard! The flavor was good, but I would not try this again. I made it for my daughter's birthday party and I was embarrassed - everyone ate their piece, but I didn't feel good about it!

I followed every trick and hint by other reviewers including sifting before measuring and folding in egg whites at the end.   Although the flavor is good, the cake was heavy and dense.  Another employee and myself brought a strawberry cake to an office get-together.  They cleaned up her cake while I took cake home.  The other cake was lighter and more flavorful.  This recipe lacks enough strawberry puree.

It was ok to me.  Everyone else loved it ! I thought it was too dense and not fluffy enough . I made a 9x11 cake and made my own pink strawberry icing. next time I'am going to add sliced strawberries as well.

Didn't like it. it is too dense. I made it into three 8 inch layers. followed all the tips from the other reviewers. separated the egg whites and beat them until I can see white peaks and  mixed them witth the cake batter in the last.Added flour, milk, strawberry puree alternatively.Frosted the cake with chocolate frosting and also put strawberry puree sweetened and slices of strawberrry between  two layers and choclate frosting and cream cheese frosting between the other two layers. still didnt like it as it is really dense

Such an amazing recipe!  Due to my son's dairy allergy I altered the recipe a bit using soy milk rather than whole milk, and 3/4 cup of oil rather then butter and it turned out excellent.  Will definitely make this again!

It was perfect! Layered fresh strawberry between layers and to top the cake. Everyone loved it! Every crumb was eaten in less then 24 hours (4 adults) :) Can't wait to make it again!

VERY GOOD but I used it for a checkerboard cake and the strawberry part was more moist than the yellow cake and didn't rise as much.  I didn't use the whole packet of gelatin for this reason....because I didn't want that weird gelatinous consistency but it still was a tad overly moist.  Very good strawberry flavor however.

I absolutely love the flavor of this cake, however, it shrinks quite a bit... too much. I assume because of the jello.  If anyone has an answer for me to prevent the shrinkage, please respond.

What a delicious cake! Mine turned out too dense because I didn't realize you HAD to make it in multiple layers, and I just wanted a single sheet cake. I did sift the cake flour before measuring, and I followed the other instructions exactly, so the type and number of cake pans seem to really make or break this in terms of texture. However, the taste was simply heavenly! Nobody cared that it was dense - the flavor was unbeatable! I'll be saving this one.

I have made this cake twice and it has turned out great both times! The second time around, my daughter wanted a raspberry cake for her birthday so I substituted raspberry gelatin and puree. She was pleased and so were our guests. Next year she wants blueberry so I think I'll try that, too!In regard to the density issues other reviewers have noted, either sift your flour first or just fluff it up before lightly scooping out. Basic cream cheese icing and seedless jam between the layers finish it off well.

Four stars instead of five, because while it was fabulous, I used puree made from unsweetened strawberries I had frozen from last year's surplus, and the cake was perfectly sweet.  I'm afraid sweetened puree would have sent it over the top. Pressed for time, I frosted it with an old Jel-sert frosting recipe:  One package Royal vanilla instant pudding whipped with a pint of heavy whipping cream.  The next time I make this cake, I plan on frosting it with a butter roux (ermine) frosting.

Smells strawberrylicious! This cake is great for the kiddos but I wouldn't serve this to just anybody. It's very easy to make, it's pretty, and it taste decent.

Made this for my daughters 2nd birthday and it was a hit. I did not puree the strawberries, just smashed em' with a fork. No problems with denseness or any other factors.

Read the review before trying the recipe. Only thing I changed was adding 1/2 cup less sugar. As for the directions I did everything exactly the same except separating the yolk and white like some suggest.  The cake was good, but like most reviewers have said the cake did not rise, though it was moist and crumbly.

Too dense even with suggested alterations. I suggest simply doctoring up boxed cake mix by infusing some strawberry flavor somehow. This way the texture will be soft and fluffy instead of thick and heavy.

This cake has very little taste to it.  It smells great when baking but you hardly taste the strawberry.  Very bland.  I used a cream cheese icing to add sweetness.  The cake itself is anything but sweet.

I was wanting strawberry cupcakes so I tried this recipe.  It did not turn out.  I followed the recommendation to seperate the eggs and fold in the beaten egg whites last.  The cake was very crumbly and would not stay in the paper cupcake holders.  I tried another strawberry cake that starts with a cake mix and had no problems.

Delicious. I was concerned that after cooking 30 minutes my cake was still very runny, so I ended up cooking it about 45 minutes. I used the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting and added the leftover strawberry puree to it. My hubby loved this cake.

I very much enjoyed this.   I used pre-sifted flour and resifted it in a strainer, and it was still a little "dense", but it was very flavorful and very moist.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Like someone else recommended, I used a little of the remaining puree I had to put on top of the icing in the middle and it was delicious.   I'm not yet a baker, but this recipe has inspired me.

This cake is delicious! I made it just like the recipe called for. I sifted my flour before measuring and then sifted again with the baking powder. I did use 3 pans instead of 2 and I baked it for 20 mins. It came out very moist.  Next time, I will possibly add 1/4 cup more puree to the batter for a stronger strawberry taste.  The next day the cake was still moist. It didn't get dense like some of the reviews stated. It did firm up a little, but it's not that noticeable.  I made a cream cheese frosting and used 4 tablespoons of puree. The frosting had a hint of strawberry taste, but it wasn't over-powering. Will definitely add this cake to my favorite cake recipes!

Maybe I did something wrong, but my cake did not turn out airy and light.  It was extremely dense and heavy.  It definitely tasted like strawberry, too much actually.  The basis of this recipe isn't bad, but I think it needs a lot of tweaking to make it work.  In the end I was really not happy with the existing recipe.

This cake was very good but it was to much batter for the cake pans. It made a mess in my oven. Not sure if i will make it again unless i use 3 pans.

this cake was really good, I followed the directions pretty much to the "T" except I only used 1/2 the jell-o, and a little less sugar, and I added 2 tbsp of strawberry jam when i pureed the strawberries. good recipe!

I made this cake for my daughter's 3rd birthday and made it into cupcakes!  I made a few changes according to some other reviews.  I only used 1 cup of sugar and I used fresh strawberries.  I also separated the egg yolks and egg whites and whipped the egg whites to add some fluffiness.  This turned out FABULOUS!  I screwed up on the frosting but the cake itself turned out great!

Wow this cake was the best cake i've ever made! I used sifted APF instead of  cake mix, and it  still turned out good. I will definatly make this cake again. I also made my own homemade icing with vanilla, almond extract and strawberry cream cheese =)

Great Fluffy cake.  I did measure flour after it was sifted and separated the eggs.  I put in the yolks when it said, but I beat the whites till stiff and folded them in at the end.  Very moist cake!

This was delicious!  I made it for my son's birthday party, and everyone loved it.  It wasn't fluffy, as one person noted, and I did measure the flour after I sifted it.  But I just think that's because of the strawberry puree that it calls for.  I didn't mind it, though.  It made it nice and moist.

This was wonderful!! My husband loves the boxed strawberry cake but I can't stand it as it has that fake strawberry taste and is too sweet. I came across this recipe awhile ago but just now made it as surprise for my husband who was offered a new job today. He LOVED it! I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used half and half instead of whole milk (I didn't have whole milk on hand- and usually don't). I followed some other reviews and separated my egg whites and sifted the flower and then measured out 2 cups. I forgot the vanilla, but I personally can't tell! For the frosting I used an 8oz thing of cream cheese and about half a regular size tub of cool whip. Mixed that all together and added roughly 1 cup of puree (whatever was left over after putting 1/2 a cup in the cake batter). This was great because it wasn't super sweet! Over all awesome, awesome cake! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cake the other day as a trial run for my daughter's birthday!  It is DELICIOUS!!  I accidently pureed too many strawberries, but I'm glad I did.  I added the regular amount to the cake, but I used the extra puree and made a strawberry buttercream icing.  This really made the cake!  I will be doing this again for her party!

I made this exactly as recipe stated. Good flavor but VERY dry. I am now reading all the reviews and wish that I had before hand, I might have done some things differently. The cake from this site, banana cake VI, is SO MOIST. The recipes directions have you remove cake from oven when done, and place directly into freezer for 45 min. It says this makes the cake very moist, and it does! I wonder if this cake needs a little freezer lovin'. Anyway, I made this for my fiance's mother for her birthday and will have to say I was embarrassed to serve it because it was so dry and I am usually a very good baker. :-( I will not be making this again.

This cake has a very good taste, I also added the egg yolks and beat them  one at a time and then folded in the beaten egg whites, sifted the cake flour used only l l/2 cups sugar.  This cake is very dense and inspite of the cake flour it was not a fluffy cake.  Does anyone else have any suggestions for it to be a fluffy cake.

I work as an RA in a college dorm and I am always looking for new and fun cake/cookie recipes to make for my residents.  This one was a huge hit, and not that hard to make.  The cake tasted good, but like some of the reviews it was REALLY dense.  I think next time I make it, I will try separating the egg whites from the yokes and maybe adding a little less flour.    For my icing I made a simple cream cheese icing: 1 8oz. block cream cheese 2 teaspoons vanilla 2 tablespoons milk 1 box (4-5 cups) powdered sugar  However, instead of putting the milk in, I added 2 tablespoons of the strawberry puree and it made a delicious strawberry cream cheese frosting that everyone commented on.  I will keep experimenting until I can find a way to make it a little lighter.  But good cake.

This is a great and easy to make from scratch recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out moist and delicious. I also made the cream cheese frosting but I also added a half pack of strawberry kool-aid to give it color and a little strawberry flavor. Sounds weird but it was a great added touch! Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't know where I went wrong, but this cake was a disaster for me! Did it in 3 pans as recommended but each layer fell apart as I removed from pans. And I sifted then measured as recommended but it was really heavy and not too flavorful. Everyone else seemed to love it, so it might be something I did, but I just don't know...

An excellent strawberry cake.  Full of strawberry flavor.  I used fresh strawberries with sugar to make puree and separated the eggs.  After the mix was complete I beat egg whites to hard peaks and folded in.  This really helps the cake to rise.   Frosted with homemade butter cream icing and it was a treat for everyone.

I love this recipe, this was the first cake I ever made from scratch, and I took it to work for one of my coworkers' birhtday, and my whole office loved it and wanted the recipe. I have to say I enjoyed it myself, and now I have to make another one for my kids.

I tried making this recipe the way it calls for. I made the change in using measured flour and whipped the eggs. I make cupcakes and a cake. The cupcakes sank and the cake was as dense as a brick. The taste was great but the both had a real soggy center but golden brown edges. I have to say this recipe stumped me so you might want to make a test cake if you want to use for a large event. I will retry this next weekend with some cjanges and let you know how it goes. Also any new suggestions before I bake away?

I followed the instructions and the suggestions exactly and this did not turn out at all. The cake was sticky and cooled into having a very thick sticky crust. I didn't even bother frosting and trying to eat.

This cake is in actual fact, simpler to make then the recipe would have you believe. You just use self-raising flour; I didn't even sift it, & it came out soft, fluffy & well-risen! I suspect those who found the cake dense could have measured out the wrong amount of baking powder? The cake is moist n has a pretty nice tang to it, but nope, sorry, it doesn't have the strawberry taste I was looking for.

This is THE BEST Strawberry cake I have ever eaten!  I made this for my nephew's first birthday and it was a huge hit!!! I did separate the eggs and whip the whites into soft peaks then folded them in.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of baking powder as my first batch did not come out very tall.  I made triple the batch of this cake and other than running out of bowl space, all went well.  I also used thawed frozen strawberries with added sugar.  I drained some of the water out before adding them to the mixture.  The gelatin makes the cake a bit crumbly, so if you're using for fine detailed work; I would suggest another form of cake.  I will be making this cake again!!! It was again, WONDERFUL!!!

I made a checkerboard chocolate and strawberry caker, and this is quite possibly the best strawberry cake recipe I've EVER tried to make.  It rose beautifully with a lovely delicate pink colour.  Tastes like sweetened fresh strawberries, and is well worth every moment spent making it.

I thought that the cake was way too dense.  The cake took much longer to bake too.  Instead of 25-30 min...it took 30-40 min.  I followed the directions exact.  The taste is good, but like I said, much too dense.

I made this cake into cupcakes for my daughters valentine party.  The flavor is wonderful. Texture is a little off.  Might be my oven though.  So I gave this recipe 5 stars.

This cupcake was okay. It just tasted like strawberry gelatin to me. Didn't have like authentic strawberry flavor. I won't make this again.

I made this cake for my daughter's second birthday party and it was a big hit!  The only thing, and this is totally my fault, I over filled the pan (3/4 full instead of 2/3) and ended up having to cook it for about 40 minutes longer.  The top burned (of course) but I cut that part off and you couldn't even tell.  Because it settled for so long it was a lot more dense than it should have been.  That being said, it was delicious even though I totally botched it!  Next time I'll be more careful in how much batter I put in the pan!  Highly recommend it!  People thought I bought it from a specialty shop!  :)

I made this last night and it was delicious! I will def. be making again!  I did not have whole milk, so I just used 2%, and my strawberries weren't already sweetened so I just added a little sugar while they were processing. I made these into cupcakes. They are REALLY good, thanks for the recipe.

We made this the other night for my Mom's birthday - she had requested her usual boxed strawberry birthday cake with strawberry icing, which we don't like because it is so sweet! This cake was amazing, light and moist, great texture and nice strawberry flavor - not overpowering! Great recipe

My family and I love this recipe. Everyone speaks of the density of the cake but we love it because it still so moist. I am baking this cake for a birthday party and I am going to try some of the tips that were given, like beating the egg whites and adding them at the end. I will let you know if this makes the cake any better.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because my husband and I loved this cake. However, I made it for a party of 30 and was told no one really liked it that much. Can't figure out why but I love the dense, moist, wonderful, strawberry flavor. My husband thinks the family I made it for is crazy. :)

We didn't care for this cake as much.  It was way too sweet and tasted fake probably due to the dry jello I guess.  It also doesn't rise much either.

I made these as cupcakes and they turned out delicious!  Fill almost all the way full (3/4 at least) and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Yields ~30.  They don't turn out very pretty (they barely rise), but they taste great!

Wonderful, amazing taste and texture.  I made this for my husbands birthday and everyone went crazy.  I also made it into cupcakes and they were phenominal!  I used the whipped cream cheese frosting.  I followed others advice on using homemade strawberry puree, and whipping the whites and adding them seperatly.

This cake was really dense and heavy--and I made sure to sift first then measure the flour, but it was very heavy.  It was moist though, it had more of a consistency/density that I would expect of a wedding cake.  It was pretty yummy anyway!

This cake tastes great, but it did not rise at all! I was a little disappointed with the outcome. I was looking for a fluffy moist cake and i got a dense almsot rubbery cake. The taste is why I gave this recipe 4 stars!

I made this for my husband's birthday and it barely rose at all! i followed the suggestions of adding seperating egg whites and adding at the end, i measured the cake flour after sifing etc.. i did use fresh strawberries and i added extra strawberry maybe that was it.. i did only use 2 9" pans maybe should have tried 3. flavor would have been good though.

This was a wonderful cake!  My daughter requested a strawberry cake for her birthday.  I am not a fan of the boxed strawberry mix so I decided to try this one, and I am so glad I did.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers (sift flour before measuring, add egg whites at the end) I used cream cheese icing, and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Super moist and great strawberry flavor!

This cake came out great! I used the recipe for the base of my Strawberry Trifle and it came out superb! I was a bit concerned because I forgot to use less sugar in the cake recipe and the cake itsel;f was a bit sweet. But because I used fresh unsweetened strawberries, vanilla pudding, lemon curd & whipped cream, it balanced the sweet of the cake and was perfect. My family all but licked the bowl! I took a few tips from other reviews such as seperating the eggs and folding in the whipped egg whites. I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk. I will definitely use this recipe again (with less sugar)!

I thought this cake turned out wonderful. The only thing is I didn't have cake flour so I used all-purpose, but I thought the texture was fine and very moist. I will definitely be holding onto this recipe for company.

Very good cake.  I followed others suggestions and seperated the eggs and beat them until stiff peaks formed and added them in at the end.  I frosted it with buttcream and topped with a marshmellow fondant. I got great reviews!

I made this cake for my husband for valentines day. we had this cake for our wedding we were married in tenneesse. It was very awesome .Instead of putting the whole egg in at once I seperated them and beat the whites and then folded them in at the end . I used three pans instead of two it worked out very well.I would recomend this reciepe!

The first time I made this cake I made exactly as the recipe stated and it was woderful. I made it again yesterday and I forgot to buy the strawberry gelatin but I made it with everything else and I added just a tiny bit more starwberry puree and tasted just like white cake which was very good. This recipe is so versitle. Also, I baked it in a clear glass 9x13 pan at 350 for 45 mins. This is definitely a keeper!

I'm so mad at myself for screwing up this recipe...it turned out as dense and hard as a brick, all due to my own fault. I'm a complete novice at cakes and so didn't know the first thing about cakes- don't overmix. When I was beating the egg whites, I had a feeling I had beaten them too long because it was clumping up but I still foolishly added it to the cake. I also then overbeat the cake batter( would it work if you just mixed the batter or is a mixer necessar?) But, the cake was completely salvaged after nuking in the microwave for 10 sec...the texture for some reason returned. I didn't mind the cake cold and hard either though...great strawberry bread. I have a very small sweet tooth but the full 2 cups of sugar was fine. Used cool whipped frosting recipe from here and stawberry puree between layers- that was a good decision. Can't wait to make this again because this is the first time I've REALLY enjoyed the taste of a strawberry cake- didn't taste artificial at all.

Excellent moist very sweet. I only wish there was a frosting included with the recipe to balance out the sweet of the cake.

This cake was delicious.  I've been searching for a homemade strawberry cake for a very long time.  My niece and her Dad loves strawberry cake.  No more Duncan Hines for me.  I did sift my cake flour then measure.  I also separated the eggs and folded in the egg whites (beaten to a peak).  it was super moist and rose well!  I will definitely make this again.  I would also like to try with cooking oil instead of butter.  I will let you guys know how that works.  I thought it also had an excellent taste.  I will also try it with strawberry flavoring the next time.

First attempt ever at cake from scratch.  Made sure to read all the comments and follow the instructions exactly.  This is getting only 4 stars because I didn't enjoy it, just not my flavors.  However, I served it at a birthday party and had many great comments about how it tasted exactly like strawberry icecream.  It was a success.

I made this twice because I thought I did something wrong, it is dense and heavy even though I sifted the cake flour before measuring and folded in beaten egg whites at the end.  I tried both 9" pans and three 8" pans.  They both turned out extremely dense and on the dry side.  When frosted with whipped cream cream cheese frosting with puree added, it is very good flavor, but the texture is not pleasant to eat.

This cake must have weighed 5 pounds! The flavor was wonderful, but it was too dense to enjoy eating. 
I did use cake flour - I did sift it - and, I even used a little less flour. It appeared to not raise at all ????

This cake came out heavy and just tasted too sweet for me, and too much like fake strawberries with the jell-o in it, but it certainly fit the bill of a, "pink and red cake" which is what my three year old requested for his birthday.  He loved it.

Followed the recipe pretty much as written except I sifted the flour then measured it. I also used one tsp. of vanilla not one tblsp. Next time I might cut down on the sugar it was a little oon the sweet side.

I had to leave a raving review for this recipe. My cake came out perfect, moist, and flavorful. I sifted my cake flour first before I measured. I reduced the temperature by 25 degrees to help with the "hump" in the middle of the cake. I wish I'd remembered to take a picture of the cake. Thanks!!!

I had high hopes for this recipe, about 95% of the reviews being great, but it wasn't.  It tasted just like strawberry jello... the part that baked right anyway.  If I wanted strawberry jello that's what I would have made.  If you do try this recipe I recommend baking in a regular pan, I used an egg shaped pan, that may be why part of it didn't bake up properly. 

I will not try this recipe again.

Well, I tried this again using cake flour this time. It was much better and received good reviews at a party. A bit lighter but still very sweet. I used the Whipped Cream Frosting which complimented the cake well.

First Review (3 Stars):
I made this for my Nephew's 4th birthday, he specifically asked for strawberry cake. I tried sifting the flour first as suggested, but it still came out very dense. While the flavor was good, it was very sweet and I was disappointed at how heavy the cake was.

It was great. I think the big thing to remember is to use cake flour and measure after sifting. The time to bake was much longer for me. About 40-45 minutes. It went over really well at my house. It was very moist and light. I substituted Vanilla soy Milk instead of regular milk and it worked just fine.

This cake was awesome. I think it could do for a bit more pureed strawberry, but it was definitely a hit. Try it with Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting. :D This is a keeper.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I am now trying to use it with spelt flour to make it "healthy".  (I'll let you know how it works).  I definetly think cream cheese icing is the way to go!!

I accidentally used strawberry-banana gelatin instead of strawberry, so I think that's why mine didn't turn out so great.  I took the advice of separating the yolks/whites.  I used nonstick floppy pans and the cake fell apart, but I'm pretty new at it, so I'm sure I just wasn't experienced enough.  Most people liked it, but I feel like they said it to make me feel better.  It didn't seem sweet enough, but that could be a lot of things I didn't do right :).

This is a wonderful recipe.  It has a great strawberry flavor and is so moist.  I mixed in some seedless strawberry jam with my buttercream, the two together were so good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made this cake for my dad for his birthday. It was certainly a hit with him and my brothers. It was very moist...and kind of thin so I ended up making a strawberry creamcheese filling using strawberry flavored cream cheese, whipped, cream and sugar. I also made a strawberry cream cheese icing. I froze the cake over night and then let it thaw in the fridge. I then placed strawberries that had been dipped in dark chocolate and walnuts around the rim of the cake. I'll definitely use this one again. :)

This cake turned out pretty good.  I used 3 9" round pans.  I also reduced the strawberry puree to 1/4c. and had nice moist, but not soggy layers. I think if I make this again, I will use strawberry nectar instead of milk to give the cake a stronger strawberry flavor. I used seven minute frosting, which worked really nicely!

I haven't had any prior experience with strawberry cake, but this was pretty tasty. The flavor came more from the Jell-o than the actual strawberries, but it wasn't bad. The pink color is great, and the cake stays moist. I used cream cheese frosting.

Tasty... but very strange texture.  It may've been my fault, I don't think I used enough flour.  Make sure to garnish with sliced strawberries and stick some in between the layers as well!

I made this cake (as cupcakes) for my daughters birthday party.  It was fantastic!  I ate some of them without frosting and it was still the best cake I've ever had.  I was nervous after reading how moist it was but the cupcakes held together nicely.

I made this for my son's birthday party. I had been looking all over for a strawberry cake from scratch. It was VERY moist and tasty. I had only one problem, which was probably due to the shape of my pan...since I used a cake pan shaped like a train, I had to bake the cake quite a bit longer than the prescribed time in order for it to cook thouroughly. Then because it was so dense, part of the cake broke when I turned it out of the pan. There were NO left-overs after the party! YUMMY!

after reading reviews i change the sugar to 1-1/3 cups. i used 2% milk as this is what i have on hand and by mistake i used 1-1/2 baking soda instead of baking powder. and i used margarine in place of butter. overall the cake turned out delicious.... egg whites was beaten separately too for an airy light texture.

I liked the idea of whipping the egg whites separately, and I did that.  The cake texture and flavor was ok, I had decorated the cake for my daughter's b-day so the frosting was more than I would normally do and drowned out the real flavor of the cake.  I would make the cake again but it overflowed my cake pan as well (the pan holds a boxed mix made for two 9 inch layers).  So next time I would not pour the whole mix in, you might be able to bake the extra in a smaller cake pan.  Overall, good but could be tweaked to be better.

Delicious!  I made a strawberry filling and frosted it with a butter cream frosting.  Everyone thought it the best strawberry cake they had ever tasted.
