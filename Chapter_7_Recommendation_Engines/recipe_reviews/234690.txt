I've tried so many jalapeno dips and been disappointed so many times.  Who would have thought the secret was a combination of fresh and pickled jalapenos with chilies to add depth.  I loved it best warm but not baked and left the extra cheese layer off the top.

I have never rated a recipe, and normally I only try ones that have been rated........ here goes...... I make a similar dip from this site that co-workers love, they rated this one a 10............. I added too much jalapeno as I thought the ranch would make it mild.............. stick to the recipe, and I wish I would of taken a picture...

This dip is amazingly easy and was a HUGE hit! I did make a few changes, but it still deserves 5 stars. I added bacon bits, 4 diced jalapenos instead of one, and 1/4 mayo 3/4 cup sour cream instead of just sour cream. I also added Trader Joe's Smoked Ghost Peppers that come in a grinder. We like things hot, so it was perfect!

very good ... used 1 cup of ranch dressing, instead of envelope of ranch dressing and sour cream. Was amazing.

So easy to make.  Everyone loved it.  Just the right bite. Served with tortilla chips.  Definitely will make again.  I baked through until cheese on top was bubbly.
