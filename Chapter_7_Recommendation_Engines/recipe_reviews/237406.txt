So this was really good. I made some changes based on the reviews and what I had on hand. Used 2 boneless chicken breasts, cubed. Browned them with the garlic and onion. Added 2 whole cans of Rotel tomatoes and the cooked quinoa, along with a can of black beans (rinsed and drained), a little salt and about a tablespoonful of dried cilantro, and served with a squeeze of lime.  Husband and I both liked very much! Will definitely make again!

After preparing it according to the recipe I thought it was a little bland.  I noticed one of the reviews mentioned lime juice so I added lime juice, fresh cilantro, a little paprika and a little season salt. This helped give it a little extra flavor and the family enjoyed it.

I loved this, so much so that I ended up having 2 servings. I scaled down the recipe to 4 servings (since I only had 1lb of ground chicken and 1 can of Rotel), but followed the recipe exactly.  Super easy to make, very healthy, high protein and definitely hits the spot. I'm always looking for new ways to prepare ground chicken. I'll be making this one often. I suggest adding salt and pepper while browning the meat to really bring out the flavors.  For those saying it's bland...try salt! It does wonders. I can't wait to have this for lunch tomorrow! Yum!  EDITED TO ADD: Yup, just as delish the next day! I'm thinking this would be excelled stuffed into a pita, or as a filling for stuffed peppers.

We loved this and it was so easy to make!  Rating the recipe a 4 because I did modify it based on the other reviews, would be a 4 ½ if we could do half stars as it was great. I chopped up a red bell pepper and sautéed it with the onions and garlic. I also added the juice of one lime, a tsp of cumin, a tsp of ancho chili powder and a couple tsps of dried cilantro (wish I would have had fresh!). The kids inhaled it, so I will definitely make this again - might be my new favorite way to make quinoa!

I LOVE this recipe. I make it quite often, it is pretty easy and not a lot of ingredients. The lime juice makes a pretty big difference, so don't forget it! :-)

We really enjoyed this very easy to make dish.  I did use chopped baked chicken breast instead of ground chicken.  I used a whole onion chopped and just one can of Rotel.  I did add a can of rinsed black beans.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe StephR0131.

This is the best quinoa recipe I have found so far. I used ground turkey and leftovers heat up nicely. It's a keeper - thanks for sharing!

Our entire family demolished this! I had the last minute idea to serve with the option to add tortilla chips and Mexican cheese. This really added to the appeal for the kids. Everyone went for seconds! I also added lime juice as suggested. Put a 4/5 stars to review the actual recipe vs my changes. Thanks for this!!!

Yum! I used fresh tomatoes and semi-hot peppers from yum garden. Next time I might try easing up on the broth (adding water) and adding some other veggies.

This is virtually flavorless.  Perhaps a good base for something else, but really forgetable.  I'll likely try this again in the future with a new spice combination and maybe a good side/wine to complement the flavors.  I don't recommend the recipe as-is.

I've made this twice now and my family really enjoys it! The first time I stuck to recipe exactly. The second time I added garlic salt to the quinoa and to the chicken while browning. I also used a can of lime and cilantro diced tomatoes and added a splash of lime when it was done. It was much better the second time!

Again I used homemade vegetable juice I had canned instead of chicken broth. (did use some chicken bullion). I only had a small amount of Quinoa so added Kaniwa. (smaller and red). I think it turn out very good. Added some sprilized Zucchini, and dehydrated tomatoes.I probably shouldn't review recipes because I'm always changing them to fit what I have available.

Good basic recipe.  Added black beans drained, turmeric, oregano, basil, bit of hot sauce, salt and pepper.  Ate with unsalted good quality tortilla chips.

Didn't notice that it was supposed to be ground chicken, but used chicken breast instead. It was delicious and was an amazing first dish for someone who hasn't cooked before.

I turned it into curry. Instead of cooking the quinoa with chicken stock, I cooked it with coconut milk, water, and curry paste. YUM!

I followed this recipe except I used cubes chicken breast and added black beans as some other reviewers suggested. I topped with cheese. So delish! A gooey Mexican type dish without any of the guilt!

I finally found a way to use Quinoa that my husband really enjoyed.  I stuck to the basic instructions, but followed the suggestions of others, added a bit more onion, 3 cloves garlic and all purpose seasoning.  I also threw in a can of kidney beans I had.  It was quick and easy, he had 2 helpings and brought some to work for lunch!  Thanks for this new favorite.

This is a easy delicious dish. I added another clove of garlic, cumin, 14 oz diced tomatoes with juice, 1 roma tomato chopped, 5 roasted green chilies and a little more onion. I didn't have Rotel tomatoes. I froze leftovers for work lunches. I will make this recipe regularly, it's that GOOD!

This dish was easy to make. I used some tricolor quinoa, which I think made it more appealing in appearance. Like others suggested, I added black beans and then added some cayenne for a boost. I'd like to think of a way to make the taste more complex on the next go round, such as add Italian sausage (no cayenne) or an additional vegetable (if those would do it - I'm not a chef! :)). Regardless, I will make this again.

I just finished making this but tweaked like others did.  I used organic chicken breast.  Seasoned with salt pepper , cayenne pepper, garlic powder and cumin.  When I sautéed the onion I also added minced garlic.  To the quinoa I added a little low sodium soy sauce.  Once The chicken was cooked I added the rotele can and quinoa to the chicken then I added green onion and cranberries and a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  Let  it all simmer then topped off with a small squeezed lime. Had a small taste and taste yummy...can’t wait to have this for lunch tomorrow.  This is a keeper but you need to make it your own, to your liking otherwise I think it would be tasteless. But thank you for the foundation of this dish.

The recipe itself is bland. I do advise whoever makes this dish to add some seasoning to the chicken. I did appreciate the measurements and the length of time to cook each item.

Recipe is bland but easy to make really tasty. I added about 1 cup of sweet chilli sauce, 1tbsp paprika, salt and pepper and it was really good. With the additions, 5 stars. Without any additions, 1 star.

Not bad except that I simmered this for quite a while after mixing all ingrediants but the chicken seemed to still lack flavour. t needs a little something before the Rotel goes in. Definitely salt and pepper, wished I had some lime juice would have liked to try that. Will make again for sure but give the chicken a boost with something.

Love this recipe! Followed the tweaks in the reviews - 2 cans tomatoes, salt & pepper to taste, a can of black beans, cubed chicken instead of ground. I also added sriracha - a few squirts, and topped with fresh cilantro - perfection!

Very good! I made a couple changes. We don't care for ground chicken so I used chicken breast and cut it up into very small chunks. I used a combination of hot and mild tomatoes with chilis and added twice the amount of tomatoes as called for.  It turned out amazing!

I'm not a very good cook, so I was pleased with the simplicity of this recipe. Also, it tastes even better the next day.

Some things I'd do differently next time:

Use yellow onions instead of white (the white made it too sweet).

I had to substitute diced tomatoes plus some chopped jalapenos, which was fine, but I didn't chop enough for our taste.

The package of quinoa (Trader Joe's) had a shorter cooking time for the quinoa, which I didn't realize until it was almost past it. I decided to go with the recipe's cook time and it was fine.

This was a family hit, even my 17 year old (not a quinoa fan) enjoyed it.

Here are a few things I did differently.
1)  Used a quinoa bulger mix to increase the fiber content
2)  Doubled the chicken broth (bulger really needs more liquid)
3)  I prefer stock over broth, so that is what I used
4)  Added celery salt during chicken browning
5)  Used 2 cans of Rotell with green chilies 
5)  Used 2 lbs of ground chicken.  

The changes alter the nutrition on the recipe, but I haven't worked out all the numbers and details yet.

This was a quick and easy meal. I didn't have the spicy tomatoes so just used a can of fire roasted tomatoes with Italian herbs. Also chopped up some fresh thyme, parsley, chives and basil and threw in salt and pepper.

I cooked up the quinoa quickly in my mini pressure cooker.

added salt, coriander, paprika, lime juice, hot sauce, dried chili peppers. Just a very small amount of each as I was afraid of ruining it.  Also a can of rinsed black beans. will be great to take for lunches and it was easy to make.

I loved this recipe!!! The only things I did different was use ground turkey instead and add some roasted sweet potatoes on top and it tasted beautifully together.  Definitely will be adding this to the weekly rotation!

The ground chicken adds an odd texture. I think it would be delicious with real chicken chopped up. I also added extra spices, as it seems slightly bland.

Inspired by previous reviewer, I added 1 can Rotel tomatoes and 15 oz light coconut milk, 1 cup frozen sliced onions and peppers, 1 bag frozen broccoli florets, and 2 - 3 tsps curry powder. I liked it but next time will add more vegetables and perhaps a few raisins.

Really delicious and healthy but I did adapt based on reviews and what I had on hand. I used 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, added a bunch of vegetables like cabbage, spinach, chopped green beans and 15 oz or so of chickpeas with some extra sea salt and seasonings (doubled the garlic and used dried thyme and oregano with fresh parsley) and served all over a bed of fresh baby spinach. I used regular canned tomatoes as that's what I had but next time would use fresh as I didn't think there was enough time to cooked the canned taste out of them.

It was OK.  I substituted ground turkey for the ground chicken but otherwise made as written in recipe.  I felt that it was lacking something (spices, more vegetables).  Will remake it with some alterations in the future.  Feel like it would benefit from broccoli and chicken breast cut into small chunks as well as Worcestershire sauce maybe?

I was in a hurry so I used pre-shredded frozen chicken. Once the quinoa was ready and the chicken was heated via the microwave, I threw all ingredients (minus the chicken broth) into a frying pan to heat it all together for a few minutes. It came out tasting great!  My husband loved it!

My family doesn’t like quinoa so I used rice instead, cooking it in chicken broth in advance.  Also, I had plain diced canned tomatoes so I added a jalapeno pepper to the mixture. I can’t have dairy so the family added the cheese individually as it was served.  It still melted in and they really liked the recipe.  I will definitely do this one again.

Loved it! I toasted the quinoa for a few minutes first, used some of the juice from the can of Rotel and added it to vegetable broth (instead of chicken broth) to cook the quinoa. I also added corn, zucchini and a finely diced jalapeño to the onion garlic and chicken. Seasoned with salt and pepper and Pico de Gallo seasoning I had. The squeeze of lime that others mentioned, some scallions and cilantro to garnish, were perfect. Will definitely do again.

This was very good. I added a jalapeno pepper (without seeds) and a yellow bell pepper chopped to add color and flavor. 
I will make again.

Recipe sounded a bit bland, so I added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and a pinch of mint. It was very good.

This was so yummy, but I did make changes. I used two whole cans of the Rotel tomatoes, added a rinsed can of blackbeans and a packet of taco seasoning. I also used ground turkey instead of chicken as it is easier to find (and usually cheaper...). Everyone loved it, even my picky 17-year old. We also added cheese and ate it with tortilla chips.

I needed a healthier option as a side dish, and found this recipe. A very pleasant surprise. Excellent flavorful side or main dish. Part of our regular rotation now. Nice one

This is an easy-to-make, healthy dish. I added yellow bell pepper to make it a bit more interesting. :-) I'd say go liberal on Italian spices, unless you have a picky 3-year-old. :-)

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  It's healthy and yummy.  I tweaked it a lil bit. I used ground turkey instead of chicken and just a regular diced tomato cause that's what I had in my pantry.  I will definitely make it again!

Very good. I took others suggestions and added lime juice, paprika, salt and pepper. I also added red pepper flakes to the quinoa portion. I let the combined portion simmer for 20 minutes and then turned off heat, covered and let sit another 40 minutes. I added feta crumbles right before serving. Fantastic.

LOVED IT!!this was my first time to cook w/quinoa, I nearly burned it to the bottom of the pan, LOL.  I added a little chopped cilantro at the end when you mix quinoa with the chicken to simmer. Even my super picky 14 year old thought it was the best.  My husband and son ate it wrapped in tortillas with refried beans and freshly shredded cheddar.  I enjoyed mine on half of an avocado with a side of refried beans and a little cheddar.  Try it you won't be sorry.

Teenage son requested the quinoa and glad to try it out. No ground chicken, but cut up chicken breasts with diced fresh serrano peppers and fresh tomatoes.
Best suggested addition was the lime juice! Also added garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, a little jar of marmalade and a couple splashes of asian dipping sauce from Trader Joe's. Still needed more spice. Next time would cut chicken into bigger pieces.

I found the ground chicken to be very dry.  The next time I would simmer the ground chicken in some chicken broth while the quinoa is cooking.

This is a good recipe, just not as flavorful as I like my food to be. 
 I ended up adding 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. of chili powder and 1/2 tsp. pepper.   The addition of the black beans  was a good suggestion by other reviewers.  I'll definitely make it again!   I'll probably add even more cumin and chili powder next time.

Oh my gosh this is so delicious, I'm supposed to be waiting for my boyfriend to come home before dinner but I literally can't stop "taste testing" from the pan! I used 2 chicken bouillons instead of the chicken broth, and added some spinach, salt, and white pepper for color and flavor. Absolutely delicious! Thank you!

Found the recipe to be very bland.  I added black beans and corn and a good amount of ground black pepper to add some flavor.

I'm rating based off of my changes, this is a great base recipe. I've made this a few times now, and I always double the recipe so we have leftovers for a couple days. I'm vegetarian, so I swap out the chicken broth for vegetable broth and omit the chicken. In addition to the ingredients listed, I add chopped sweet peppers, a can of rinsed black beans, chopped cilantro, LIME JUICE, and avocados on top. I also season with salt, pepper, paprika, a little onion powder and garlic powder. It's always fantastic!

I added fresh spinach for a bit more color, and did sautee the onions and garlic in EVOO. Like other reviewers I added salt, a dash of black pepper and smoked paprika. I used "mild" rotel and that gave it an extra kick. It wasn't NO WHERE CLOSE to being bland. I mean salt is a necessary evil, and I can't imagine having to be told to add it because we all know that ANYTHING that you cook and dont add some sort of seasoning is gonna be bland! Add a little salt or whatever your seasoning of choice and give it another shot. I thought it was VERY tasty! The only change I would suggest is use 1 lb of ground chicken, because the chicken sort of took over the dish.

UPDATE: I didn't like the texture of ground chicken so I remade this with chopped chicken breast and IT ROCKED!!!

I won't make this again. Even making the changes other reviewers suggested (adding taco seasoning like cumin, chili powder, etc., adding an extra can of diced chilis, and lime juice), this just doesn't have enough flavor.  Fat carries flavor so I think a drizzle of olive oil or something is needed (ground chicken and quinoa have zero fat.)   To make it prettier and more appetizing,  I'd suggest added green to the plate.  I topped it with diced avocado and a lime wedge, but a sprinkle of cilantro, parsley, ANYTHING green would be an improvement.  I also used pretty tricolored quinoa, and I think adding chopped veggies like tomato at the end of cooking (so it doesn't have time to get mushy) would also up the "curb appeal."  As some other reviewers stated, this was watery even after cooking for a while.  I added a spoonful of arrowroot powder (cornstarch would also work) and it thickened right up! Not a winner in taste, but healthy  and easy enough to reheat that I'll eat the leftovers.

I will make this again and double it.  I loved it and so did my picky kids and husband who will eat anything :)
I also used chicken breast and chopped them up fine instead of buying ground meat.

This was really good. I used cubed chicken breast because that's what I had on hand. I sautéed some red bell pepper with the onions and garlic. Once I added the chicken I sprinkled with a bit of smoked paprika and chili powder. It was a big hit!

This recipe is fantastic!  And exactly as described - healthy, easy and fast.  The only changes I made were: using 1/2 a 26 oz can of low sodium diced tomatoes with 1/4 tsp of smoked paprika and a pinch of ancho chili powder in place of the regular canned diced tomatoes with green chillies; served topped with freshly grated parmesan.  It turned out very mild which is good for our young picky kids.   The overall flavour and texture with all of the ingredients combined was creamy, savoury, and just incredibly delicious and satisfying.  This is also a great base recipe for swapping out ingredients for others to experiment with different flavours, or just to use up produce before it goes bad!  We will make this again, for sure.  Thank you for sharing.

I don't get the reviews stating it's bland. I thought it was great and very flavorful! Maybe add a little pepper and chili powder when cooking the ground chicken if you want to spice it up. I will be making this again many times I'm sure!

I used ground turkey instead of chicken, low sodium chicken broth and both cans of rowel tomatoes. It was good but needed some salt and just seemed to need something else. I have a similar recipe that adds frozen sweet peas. Might try adding some corn and black beans next time.

This is so easy to make and very healthy.  I use the mild Rotel so that my 10yr old will not complain too much.  She is not a fan of spicy food.  All in all it is one of our family favorites.  It goes well with a green veggie or even as a side dish if you have leftovers.  Next going to try as the insides of a quesadilla.  Yummm

Quite yummy! Based on other reviewers, I added some lime juice and paprika, and served with a little mexican cheese over the top. Delicious! Hubby ate the rest in a quesadilla the next day.

Based on other reviews, I added lime juice and some zest from 1 lime and a little salt and pepper.  

We used the chunky Rotel (medium) - but only 1 can's worth and only 1 lb of ground chicken.

Also, after dishing up the tasty mixture, I topped it with some crumbled Feta cheese.

Yummy. I just took out the garlic for green onion because I didn't have any garlic. I also used a lime juice and cilantro rotella and just added fresh green chiles. Yum! Even my 7 year old cleared her plate.

Easy peasy!!  Great taste with such simple ingredients.  I added oregano and had feta for those who wanted to sprinkle it on top.  It was a toss up between making Greek chicken patties and this, so compromised LOL!   I'll definitely make again.

This got raves from a two- and three-year-old: pretty high praise. To my taste, it was a bit bland, and I added Italian seasoning. 
I'll make it again, and next time might use tomatoes and jalapenos.

Yummy! Has a bit of a heat to it but it could have been the black pepper I added at the end of cooking. I couldn't find ground chicken so I cooked chicken breasts and put them in a food processor but then it was too small to notice :/ next time if I can't find ground chicken again, I'll get ground turkey.

Good recipe!  I bought a lot of ground chicken from wagjag and was looking for a healthy recipe.  I added salt and pepper to taste when cooking the ground chicken, and instead of adding the canned tomatoes, I added fresh tomatoes and scotch bonnet peppers.  Yum!
