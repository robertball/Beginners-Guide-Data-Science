I'm the submitter of this recipe.  I actually submitted this recipe six years ago.  I had forgotten all about it when I got the email that it was published.  Better late than never!  Thank you, AllRecipes!

Anyway, I do a couple of things a little differently now which I thought I would share.  I now use a Colby Jack mixture of cheese instead of straight Monterey Jack.  They're less greasy that way (not that this is health food by any means!).  They unfortunately don't make the McCormick white and green minced onion blend anymore, but plain dried minced onions work just fine.  Make sure to use the minced and not the white/green onion powder blend!

And I now like to use the scoop tortilla chips because the mixture won't run off the chip.  If not, try to find the thickest tortilla chip you can.  They hold up better that way.  Enjoy!

1-16-2016  ~Given the amount of cumin I'm happy with when I make guacamole, I knew from the get-go  I  would need to reduce it by half in this recipe.  Good call, because even with just half the amount it still  featured  too prominently for me.  I used fresh minced onion rather than dried and a 4-cheese Mexican blend rather than Monterey Jack.  Hubs and I agree that this intriguing array of ingredients that led me to this recipe in the first place unfortunately got a little lost by the cumin.  If I was to make these again,  I'd reduce the amount even further, if not eliminate it altogether.

Everyone loved this appetizer recipe at Thanksgiving. It's so tasty and easy to make. The scoops are a wonderful idea and work perfectly. I  assembled these at home and brought them with me and because they cook so quickly they are ready in no time. I actually got 2 cookie trays full from the recipe, so it makes a lot. I used shredded colby/cheddar cheese and monteray jack. Not greasy in the least. It says to quarter the shrimp but I must have had larger shrimp so I just cut them into smaller pieces. The combo of spices are excellent and you can taste everything working together....The adobo peppers, cilantro, cumin, parsley, minced  onion with the cheese; and they look so great! Nice orange -color, green-speckled, cheesy mounded -over scoops with shrimp pieces peeking out.  Winner!

I made this almost exactly as posted, with a few adjustments.  I’m not fond of adobe sauce/peppers, so I left them out.  I used less cumin, even though I love cumin, and I added fresh squeezed lime.  I added finely diced fresh jalapeño pepper to give it a little heat and I will make this again and again.  Such a great way to have an appetizer without the fuss of chip and dip!!

I found it to be very flavorful. Great and rather easy. Next time I would cut down on the chipotle, but that would be my only adjustment. If you were serving this with beers, then the heat would be perfect. Depends on your crowd and occasion. Would make again!

What an easy snack to make. Put in any thing and add cheese and bake. Great. I was surprised that the shells could be baked and not get either hard or soggy, they were perfect.

These were so good! I used cooked shrimp and all the other ingredients and was so happy and so easy! Served for dinner along with a rice side. Delish.

Awesome! Just enough kick.. I believe you mean 2 cups of Monterey Jack cheese and not 2lbs.  Will definitely make again!

I would add a little bit more chipotle peppers, a good dash of sriracha sauce and when it comes out of the oven top it with a bit of candied jalapeno for flavor and color.

I made this recipe for a summer deck party and everyone loved it! My only changes to the original recipe were cutting the cumin by half, as others suggested, and used fresh chopped green onion in place of minced. After making as many as needed, I froze about 2 cups of leftover shrimp & cheese mixture. A week later I was able to make another pan of nachos!

I’m getting ready to make this recipe and noticed it said 2 pounds of Monterey Jack cheese. Is that the correct amount or did it mean to cups?

Made this for dinner tonight! Turned out better than I expected it to, went with half of the amount of cumin as noted in other reviews and I think it was enough. Family ate it up and asked when I could make it again! Thank you for the great recipe!!

Everyone loved it!  I used leftover bottled spaghetti sauce, and added ketchup, garlic and onion powder,  and freshly chopped tomatoes.   

unfortunately i chose tortillas that were overly salty, so when i make it again i'll choose a chip that has less salt content.

I was weary of having shrimp on nachos. Now I'm not. I will make nachos with shrimp again. Just not this recipe. To spicy and to much mayonnaise .
