For such a short list of unassuming, everyday items, this recipe is outstanding!  Every cooks dream for a quick easy meal!!!  Helpful hints:  Use olive oil (better for you) in place of the margarine and "simply" diced potatoes with onions if you are pressed for time.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 and the country sausage gravy mix (as that's all I had).  Added corn that I had grilled during the summer and froze for stews and soups in the winter...  Wow, the smokey flavor using the frozen corn from the grill infused the soup with that little something extra chefs strive for!  On a side note:  I was rather skeptical of using the Mexican style Velvetta, but the creaminess of the cheese is what smoothed the flavor out and gave it the extra spice to keep it from being bland...  Simply wonderful!

delicious! here's how to lighten the recipe up a bit if you are trying to eat healthy: extra virgin olive oil rather than margarine, skim milk, chicken gravy mix rather than the country style gravy mix and 2% velveeta in place of the real thing. the soup still tasted rich and delicious! other modifications i made include adding one can of cream style corn and a dash of cayenne pepper and tobasco sauce. a very satisfying soup that i will be making again and again!!

This is one of my new favorite recipes from this website.  I have been looking for a corn chowder similiar to a local restaurant and now I have found it!  I made the following changes:  I omitted the chilies, cut down on the onion, added two cans of corn & one can of cream corn and used 1 cup of milk with 1 cup of heavy cream.  At the last minute I threw in some shredded chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store (it still would have been good without that) I also used Yukon Gold potatoes in this recipe.  This was to die for!  Enjoy!

This is DELICIOUS.  It looks unassuming but it has a bite to it.  This recipe makes a ton, so be careful.  I doubled the recipe so that I could have leftovers, but I would have had plenty of leftovers with the original.  I made a few changes. I thinly sliced 8oz of bacon and cooked it in the soup pot with a little olive oil until crispy.  I removed the bacon and set it aside. (Use it as a garnish later!) Then, I added the butter and the onions and celery.  You could leave out the olive oil, but olive oil has a much higher burning point and adds some stability as well as some nice flavor.  Other than that, I added two cups of diced carrots to the potatoes, subbed half of the milk with half-and-half, 1 can of corn and 2 cans of cream-style corn, and I used 1 cup Pepper Jack (instead of chiles or velveeta, yuck!) and 1 cup of Mex-mix cheese. I also added some shredded, cooked chicken in with the cheese. Be careful with the spices. I tasted it when I checked the potatoes and it was a little bland. The Jack will add the kick it needs, so don't worry.  I used low sodium, low fat chicken broth because I cook for people with different preferences in saltiness.  If you use low sodium broth, you WILL need to add salt.  A few notes: Don't use the gravy that has 'sausage bits' unless you're using a slow-cooker-it takes them a while to reconstitute.  This recipe freezes very nicely. Defrost in the fridge the day before eating.  It separates some before it freezes so reheat it on the stove

This chowder is GREAT!! I followed the directions pretty closely, which I normally don't do. The only thing I changed: I substituted ham broth/ soup base for the chicken broth and I added real bacon bits along w/ chopt green onions to the top!I didn't have the mexi velveeta so I used the regular kind. I, like another reviewer, wasn't sure I wanted to use processed cheese, but it was great!!! My whole family loved it-which seldom happens!! I will keep coming back to this recipe. It is easy to make changes according to what you have on hand!!! Thank you for sharing! Cheryl

This was very good soup.  My 6 year old loved it.  It makes quite a bit, but we enjoyed the leftovers the next night (and for lunch the following day).  I added a can of creamed corn, which seemed to work well.  Since I don't normally cook with velveeta, I just used shredded sharp cheddar which I already had on hand. I used a package of simply potatoes with diced onions instead of the potatoes and onion.  I will cook them a little longer though next time.  They weren't quite as done as I would have liked- my fault, as I was trying to hurry dinner along.  I also added some diced ham to make it a more complete meal.  We like having meat in our soup, but next time I might try grilled chicken, as the ham did make the soup a little saltier than I would have liked. Definitely a recipe I will keep and use again.

This is absolutly amazing. I made this soup for a head chef at a fancy steakhouse and he was so impressed. I used a little extra cheese (be careful, it will get too salty if you add too much), added some bacon, and grilled the corn (which i TOTALLY recommend, nothing beats that flavor!), and added a few extra peppers in there because we love spicy food and it went perfect. I served it with a salad and homemade garlic bread. nobody could move afterwards it was so exellent.

This is the most awesome recipe!!!! I make this and I ALWAYS have to make triple batches. I also have a vegetarian friend and so I will use veggie broth instead of the chicken broth and you can not tell the difference. This is one incredible soup. Love it! Thanks for sharing this one. This has been handed down to my kids as well.

This recipe has to be hands down one of the best things I have put into my mouth on a cold day. I followed other users suggestions and added bacon, and used 1 cup of half and half along with 1 cup of milk. I also used about 5 potatoes diced, used 2 cartons of Swanson's Chicken Stock, and 2 cans of corn, and a 2 cup bag of Sargento's shredded Mexican blend cheese. It turned out absolutely wonderful, and I highly suggest to anyone craving a delicious hearty chowder to try this recipe!

The gravy made this too rich and detracted from the overall flavor.  I would make a roux instead.

Very good recipe! This was fast and so easy and my vegetarian brother loved it.  I used low sodium vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth.  The only other change was that I used the onion/celery mix available at the holidays which I think also has parsley in it.  Very good and very flavorful.  I will keep this handy for when my brother visits again.

This is a delicious soup! Easy to prepare and hearty enough that no one minds the lack of meat.  Why not 5 stars? It was a touch bland for us.  Nothing a little salt wouldn't fix, but it wasn't listed and I rate based on preparing the recipe exactly as written. Also, the inclusion of the gravy mix sounded interesting, but did not enhance the recipe in my opinion.  A basic roux would have done the trick, making the gravy mix an odd and purposeless ingredient to add to my grocery list. These two things are very minor and if I could, I would give the recipe 4 1/2 stars.

THIS IS AWESOME AND I TRIED A FEW CHANGES. 5 C. POTATOES, 1 PACKAGE SHRINK WRAPPED HAM CUBES, 1 CAN OF CREAMED CORN (IN ADDITION TO WHOLE), AND THE MILK I USED 1 C. MILK AND 1 C. OF HEAVY CREAM, SO YUMMY ALSO WITH CRUMBLED PIECES OF BACON ON TOP. I ALWAYS CUT THE BACON UP WITH MY KITCHEN SIZZORS BEFORE I FRY IT AND ALWAYS END UP WITH REAL CRISPY CRUMBLY PIECES

A new family favorite.  This is a great soup to have on a cold wintery night.  I didn't use celery, as we don't care for it.  I also just used shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  The soup was wonderfully waming and perfect with homemade dinner rolls.  Will be making again!

Good stuff and quite simple to make.  I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.  I had all the ingredients on hand except for the gravy mix so I did a quick search online and found one.  Basically it was flour and a few spices but it worked just fine.  I used a mail scale to get the measurement but I'm sure that you could go with about 3-4 tablespoons and up the amount as needed to thicken.  Great recipe and easy to modify to suit tastes or available ingredients!

Doubled and used butter instead of margarine, frozen corn instead of canned, and a fresh shredded Mexican style cheese blend. I also used skim milk. This was rich and creamy. Just delicious! Will make again, Thanks!

I was COMPLETELY disappointed. I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews.   I also included brocolli and found the soup to be gritty.  Still looking for a fantastic chowder...

This soup is absolutely delicious!!  It is very simple to make; you basically just throw everything together in a pot and let it cook.  I also was extremely impressed by the short, uncomplicated list of ingredients.  My whole family loved this soup; I will continue to make it again and again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was a good starter for me.  I diced and browned four pieces of bacon then sauteed onion.  I also shredded a rotis. chicken and added for a heartier meal, added shredded cheese instead of the processed cheese and a can of creamed corn. I also put a little smoked paprika for a little smokey flavor.

OMG this is soooooo good! I added a can of creamed corn, about 1/2 lb bacon, and some half & half. I also used frozen corn. DELISH!!! My husband and kids all loved it. I even made it for my 1yr old's birthday party this past weekend, and it was a HUGE hit! Super good and super cheap!

Nice twist on a typical corn chowder. I added 1/2 lb. crisp, crumbled bacon and a can of cream corn. My husband doesn't like corn chowder and was sceptical about this but it was a hit....What better way to a man's heart then with cheese and gravy!

This recipe was outstanding. The only change I made was adding an additional can of creamed corn. Everything else I did exactly as written. It wasn't spicy at all, but very flavorful! The only change I would make next time is to maybe add more potatoes. Beware - it makes a ton! I plan to make it next time we have to bring a dish to a get-together. This is a crowd pleaser, for sure!

Delicious, wonderful, homey, comforting.  What more can I say?  I changed nothing except added leftover ham diced up.  It's very very good and keeps well for leftovers, too.  Ya gotta try this one!

This recipe was darn near perfect! We eliminated the celery because I'm the only one in the family who likes it in a soup, and took some other reviewers' advice and substituted 1 cup of fat free half and half for one cup of the milk, and added in a can of creamed corn as well as the can of whole kernel corn. My husband, who is NOT a soup fan, went to the pot and got seconds! I could not have been more shocked! My 2 and 4 year old didn't care for it, but that was only because of the chiles. I wouldn't change another thing. It was perfection! I considered adding some cooked, shredded chicken into it, but now that I've tasted it, I feel that the chicken would have ruined it!
Thanks so much for a recipe that I'll certainly make again and again and again ....

Very good Jackay! Took the advice of  others and added extra potato ... next time I'll stick to the recipe, it was a bit too much. The green chili gave it just the right amount of seasoning without being spicy. I added diced carrot and didn't have Velvetta, used regular grated cheese, Kraft Mexican blend, and it worked fine. Next time I might try creamed corn instead (less corn crunch and a bit of sweetness). Try this recipe!

The soup turned out great!! My family loved it.  I altered the recipe slightly, leaving out the chilies, and adding diced chicken breast. It was really easy and fast to make.

This was a phenomenal soup, which hubby and Roomy LOVED.   I omitted the onion, celery, and chiles (as hubby doesn't like them), and added some grilled chicken.  Also, to cut down on the fat I used half and half.  The next time I might add some carrots to make the consistency a bit chunkier, although with the chicken added it made the soup pretty chunky.  Will definitely be making this again. :)

Very good recipe!  The only changes I made were to use 3 cans of corn (2 creamed corn, 1 regular corn) instead of just one can.  The creamed corn added a nice richness to the soup.  I added a few dashes of pepper, and topped with shredded mexican blend cheese. This soup was even better the next day!

I made this for dinner last night. I added some minced garlic to the onions and celery, added a few slices of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon (which is fully cooked so I just cut it up and tossed it in right from the package), some salt and pepper, a can of creamed corn (on top of the whole kernel corn required), an extra cup or so of potatoes, and cheddar cheese instead (since thats what I had at the house).   1. One roommate saw the creamed corn and refused to eat it because she does not like creamed corn  2. Roommate above tried a bite after everyone ate since we all agreed it tasted more like cream of potato soup with corn in it and not like cream corn (which she says she hates) and she loved the soup  3. I was a little worried because of the green chiles as my girlfriend is very sensitive to spice...it was perfect for even her so don't be scared of them.  3. Everyone loved it and packed it for their lunches today (even the roommate who would not eat it last night)  4. Its just as good if not better reheated the next day.   I served it with "Roasted Garlic Bread" which was also a winner!

YUMM-O! When I first looked at this recipe, it didn't look like anything special. But, wow it's so delicious! The only things I did differently were add garlic to the onion, and I did half creamed corn (which I've never bought in my life!) Don't tell anyone there are green chiles in this , and they'll be none the wiser, but they'll be asking you what that special kick is !

The first time I made this I thought it tasted more like a
nacho-cheese dip than it did a chowder. So, I made it again
without the green chiles, and substituted 1 cup of shredded
sharp, white cheddar cheese for the Mexican-style cheese
and it was to die for, to me. Don't let the recipe's lack of
spices bother you, that all comes with the "country-style
gravy mix," as does the thickening of the chowder. This is
truly a 5 star recipe - highly recommended!

This chowder was awesome, I took some advice from the reviews and used the cream corn, fat free half and half instead of milk, and used the canned baby potatoes.  It was extremely easy and quick. I also added some bacon at the very end.  My husband and my kids loved it and kept saying "Thank you Mom."

Best corn chowder I've ever made, deserves 10 stars! Used 5 potatos, added 8oz. can cream corn, skipped the celery, 1% milk, added celery seed, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I just used winco's flavorite house brand contry gravy mix.  I also skipped the processed cheese and used 2 cups grated mexican cheese blend.  I did end up needing to add an extra cup of water to cover the potatos.  Perfect with a little extra salt and pepper.

Fast, easy, inexpensive soup to make.  I tripled the recipe and took it to work today to share. Everyone said it was really good. I took advice from others and used cheyenne pepper to spice it up more and I used the creamed corn.  Next time I make this recipe I will add chunks of grilled chicken.

This is a great basic recipe that you can change to suit your taste.  I made the following changes.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Instead of celery, I used 1/2 to 1 cup of red bell pepper and 1/2 to 1 cup of green bell pepper (I added these when I added the corn).  I used two cans of corn instead of one (if you use Freshlike brand, you don't need to drain the water).  Finally, instead of processed cheese, I used 1 1/2 to 2 cups of shredded Mexican cheese.  This version turned out great!  A definite keeper!

I tripled this recipe and froze for future meals. My husband who usually won't go near soups had seconds! My two toddlers also ate a full bowl. We sprinkled shredded cheddar and jack on top which added to the cheezy taste they all love! This freezes very well.

I've made this recipe now probably 100 times. It is always a winner. The only difference I have made over the years is frying some bacon and cooking the veggies in the fat, adding the bacon at the very end and also adding jalapeno throughout. Oh yeah, I tend to add a little more cheese sometimes. SO YUMMMY!!

Good recipe but I made a few changes for the better- instead of the diced green chillies, I added a tablespoon of taco sauce. It sounds odd, but it just adds depth to the flavor of soup and is very palatable. Also, instead of the processed cheese, I stuck to the trusty shredded cheese (at least 1 cup); it tends to work best with the yellow cheeses (I prefer cheddar). Be sure to let the soup cook slightly before adding the cheese else the heat will scorch the cheese. It won't create a difference in flavor but it will make the texture a bit grainy.

This soup was delicious! I changed it a little by using almond milk instead of cow's milk, adding 1 cup chopped facon (fake bacon), substituted carrots for the chilis and also put in more cheese than called for.  It was so good, I'll be making this again!

Just found this recipe and it sounded so good.  I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to make it.  My hubby absolutely loved it and I did as well.  This is definitely a keeper for us.  I could not believe how simple but delicious this recipe is.  A winner for our family.

I gave it 5 stars it was so good-make a couple of changes-left out the chilies and celery (we don't like) and used Velveeta Queso Blanco cheese and used green onions. It was fantastic!

This was by far the best Cheesy Potato Corn Chowder I have ever had.  This recipe is even better than the one my favorite restaurant serves, I will be making it often.  Here are the changes I made; I cooked bacon first to use later on top then I took the bacon grease and sauted the onion (no celery we don't like it).  I added 1 can of corn and 1 can of creamed corn.  I added 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy whipping cream.  My only regret was making it too early, after the first little "Taste Test" I am found it hard to stay away from the pot!!!

My husband asked for corn chowder. This is the recipe I selected.  It was DELICIOUS! The only change I made was adding 2 chopped jalapeno peppers to the celery and onion during the sautee process.  And I used cheddar instead of Velveeta.  I served it with garlic/cheese biscuits and cooked apples.  What a hit it was!

Great! The only thing I changed was I used a whole bag of frozen corn instead of the canned corn. The green chilies were a nice addition. My DD often asks to have the "corn soup".

This is a great recipe and forgiving if you don't have the exact ingredients. I didn't have gravy mix so made white gravy.  Didn't have mexican style cheesefood so used a jar of tostedos queso.  Turned out great though I did add a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Thaks Jackay!!!

I made this with vegetarian chicken flavored boillon cubes that i got at the organic food store. Im trying to cut down on meat. I wasn't sure how it would turn out but it was TO DIE FOR. The gravy mix was hard to dissolve but that wasnt a big deal. Thank you for this recipe

AMAZING!!!  I have made this recipe twice and it has received 5 stars each time!  I personally do not care for green chilies so I cooked half the chowder with chilies and half without.  My hubby loved both versions but preferred his with the chilies.  I used Mexican shredded cheese instead of the processed cheese that was recommended.  I even crumbled a few crackers over the top of my bowl for a little crunch.  So good!

This is wonderful, I really wasn't expecting to love it so much.  As suggested by others I used 50% half and half and 50% milk (skim).  I pan fried about 6 slices of bacon and used the fat to cook the vegetables.  I used 1/2 carrots and 1/2 celery.  Instead of Mexican Velveeta (yuck) I used a Mexican blend cheese and added a few dashes of hot sauce.  This is amazing paired with beer bread on a cold day.

Everyone raved about this! I made this on a camping trip... Cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven over a fire pit. I think what made it so delicious was fire roasting the corn. I also used frozen pre-cut potatoes and added pre-cooked chicken and served with sour cream. A-mazing.... we're still talking about this one! Thanks! :)

This is a very good recipe, but my husband kept commenting that it was missing something. I have to agree with him. I think it would taste out of this world with something like ham or chicken.  I threw some dumplings on top and used cheddar instead of Velveeta.  It is VERY good and very hearty.

Delicious! I have been making this soup for awhile now and it is always a crowd pleaser - even my 4 year old loves it.  The recipe makes a lot so I always have enough leftover to freeze for later.

This chowder was awesome!! I was a little hesitant about the diced chiles since I don't usually like spicy food so I only used half the can and there was just the right amount of heat for me. I went with some of the suggestions, adding half a can of creamed corn and some frozen corn. I also added some bacon bits and dill weed. Tasted like restaurant soup. Will be making this one again and again!

Quick, easy and delicious.  I didn't have celery, but I did have pre-cooked, crumbled bacon, so I put some of that in.   And I used regular shredded cheese instead of "processed cheese" (didn't have that either).

I have made this twice now within just a few weeks ....the first time I was going to make it and freeze for quick dinner nights. That never happened as the whole family ate it up. This time I doubled the recipe, added shredded chicken and now have a few nights worth in the freezer. Great and easy recipe!.  Just a tip: I cut down on the cooking time by steaming the potatoes in my pampered chef steamer in the microwave, making them nice and tender, then add it to the mixture. Then I don't have to wait a long time for the potatoes and can speed the process up alot.  THANKS for a great recipe :)

This turned out to be incredibly tasty and it was easy to make.  The only tweaks I made to the recipe was adding about 1/4 cup of half-and-half, and just a tad of butter.  Very yummy indeed, especially on those cold days.

Fast, easy & delious.  Don't skip the green chiles, they do not make it too spicey.  I used yukon gold potatoes & minced the celery & onion.

Loved this recipe. I used regular Velveeta and it was still a little spicy. Next time I think I will leave out the chilis entirely.  It was really really good.

I kept the recipe the way it was.  My husband loves corn chowder and I could never get it exactly how he liked it.  This soup was thick, tasty, and flavorful. He loved it and asks for it on cold days.  You have to leave the chiles in.  You can hardly tell that they are there.  The chiles just add an extra flavor that makes this soup special.

I don't add the celery or the chiles (not a fan)but I do add sliced ham or chopped bacon. I don't use the Mexican style cheese, just regular Velveeta. Excellent! I think I end up putting in more potatoes, but I then add a bit more broth. This is a regular at our house in the cold months.

Very good.  Used shredded cheddar/jack cheese because couldn't find mexican velveeta.

This was a delish soup. I served mine in bread bowls. My guests loved it. Although I would do something a little different with the broth. Maybe add a titch of half N half. Just seemed to be missing something rich and thick about it. Careful not to over cook your potatoes:)

The kids loved it.  I will have to put ham in it next time though because it is not a meal without a slab of meat in it for my husband!  This was an easy hearty meal on a cold night.

This is very good as written.  It was much better after I let it simmer for an hour to let the ingredients blend together.  The next time I'll add more cheese and I might omit the chilis.  I don't think they're needed.

This was a pretty easy recipe, and tasted very good.  It was difficult to find the type of cheese listed, so I just used 1 cup shredded Cheddar.

Wow. What an amazing chowder! 
I only did a few things differently based on the fact that I used 4 cups of potatoes vs 3. 
 - I added an additional can of broth.
 - I used a can of creamed corn and an 11 ounce can of Mexicorn.
 - I added a cup of ham. 
 - I used 12 ounces - the whole block - of the Mexican-style cheese. It was a block that I cut up because I was unable to find shredded. 
 - I used Yukon Gold potatoes which I love. Great flavor - really good for mashed potatoes. 

My husband has been wanting me to make something like this for months. He told me tonight that "this is just what I wanted!" Excellent recipie!

For all those concerned with eating healthy, I am posting this review with how I made this recipe with mostly ORGANIC ingredients and it turned out AWESOME!

First, I did not use the country gravy mix packet since it contains MSG.  I made my own gravy.  I heated 1/4c. olive oil and added 3/4 cup unbleached, unbromated flour with 1t. salt and 1t. pepper and browned it.  Then, slowly added 4c. milk and cooked over low.  I added this to the recipe where it called for the gravy mix to be added to the milk, instead I just added my homemade gravy.

I used organic potatoes, onions, milk and chicken broth.  I followed the reciped exactly but just used my organic ingredients and substituted the gravy.  I also used chunk cheddar cheese and grated it myself (because pre-grated cheese has cellulose in it - maybe from wood?).  I did do the very bad thing and add regular Velveeta cheese because I did not have enough cheddar but I guess sometimes you gotta cave!  LOL

Anyhow, it was fabulous!  My friend made it the way the recipe states and it was good that way, too!  :)

Great (and SUPER easy!) chowder! The gravy mix as a thickener is a great idea - lots of extra flavor there! We added matchstick carrots, and threw in some diced up smoked ham which gave it a nice smoky flavor. Also, if you have picky little eaters in the house who boycott all things green (lol) and are tempted to skip the green chilis, definitely drain the liquid from the can into the soup at the very least - it gives it a great little kick without any excessive spiciness. The only other minor adjustment we made other than those above was substituting the milk for fat-free evaporated milk (only took 1/2 the amount) for a creamier, richer texture, and added an extra can of broth to compensate. The whole family (green haters included!) loved it! Will definitely be on our Winter soup/stew agenda from now on. Also, just a tip: Remove from heat immediately after serving, as the potatoes cubes will continue to "melt" as it heats and thicken the soup considerably. Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this.  I made the changes as others suggested (added 2 cans creamed corn, used half & half instead of milk) and also added a lot more cheese.  Used about 1 1/2 cups shredded fiesta blend cheese & just a slice of velveeta.  The best tip was using canned new potatoes to save time - this was huge!  Just put them in & brought to boil for the next step so they wouldn't get too soggy.  

Not too spicy so next time I'll probably add another can of chiles or maybe some jalepeno peppers for extra kick.   Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this recipe with some of the changes suggested but I still thought it lacked some spunk.  If I make it again, I will definitely add more potatoes to give more substance.  I think the reason I was disappointed is because I already have a GREAT corn chowder recipe, which I will post!

This is a keeper--delicioius!  I added my own changes to this recipe thanks to the great reviews.  I did not use the celery or green chiles, but added turkey burger instead.  I did not use the processed cheese but used Cabot's 75% fat free cheese and fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. I used a bag of frozen corn and added 1 can of creamed corn.  I also just added some pepper though I don't think I will next time as the gravy mix had enough and a dash or two of salt.  Before the soup was done, I did add a bit of cornstarch to make it thick on a cold winter's night--yum, yum and yum.  I'm going to use the suggestion of another cook to use brocoli--this soup is very versatile and the country style gavy mix really gives it a nice flavor.  My hubby loved the soup...so this is certainly a keeper--thanks for sharing Jackay!!!

This recipe was very easy, which I appreciated. No roasting corn on the ear or anything like that, but it needed some doctoring to give it some additional flavor. Lacked the spice that I thought it would -- may have been my fault on that one, though, because I used 2 cans of MILD chiles so I could use 2% velveeta instead of the full fat mexican version. I should have put in at least one can of HOT chiles. When it was all done, it tasted pretty OK and I assumed that the flavor would develop over timed, but when my husband tasted it, he said it needed something meaty and smoky, so I added some turkey smoked sausage, which really did add to the flavor. I recommend adding the smoked sausage, especially if you want to make a full meal out of it. Probably won't make again soon -- not because it's bad, but because I'd like to try some other versions of corn chowder before settling on a favorite.

Fabulous!  I added one can of cream corn, added turkey bacon, used Fat Free Half & Half instead of milk.  My husband & kids all loved it...my hubby ate 3 bowls!  Served with cornbread.  Hubby said it will have to be a "regular" meal around our house!

Excellent !  We liked the structure of this recipe so much we adapted it for a cheese and broccoli soup by omitting the celery, potatoes, corn, chiles and mexican style cheese.  Instead added the flowerets from 2 broccoli crowns, an additional can of chicken broth, 4 crumbled strips of bacon and a 10 oz grated block of marbled cheddar cheese.  Wonderful variation and tonight we are adapting the recipe for asparagus !  The gravy mix is a terrific touch !

Fabulous Soup!  Classic Corn Chowder with a hint of spiciness (from the chilis) - we really enjoyed this recipe.  I will defintely make this again.  Serve with warm rolls for sure!

Finished product needed a little "salt", so I added some Lawry's - delish!

Delicious!  My husband and I loved this chowder.  It has a great flavor.  Instead of the mexican velveeta, we used 1 1/2 cups sharp white cheddar and two 4 oz cans of green chilis.  I also used a can of cream style corn, as suggested by other reviews.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

This was a huge hit. It was exactly how I expected a corn & potato chowder to be. I did not add the celery or green chiles (don't care for them), and I used the shredded mexican cheese. It melted just as well and we love real cheese in almost any dish. This soup makes a nice large amount, and I will be definitely be making it again. Perfect winter soup, as it leaves your tummy feeling nice and warm!

Delicious! You can even drink it out of a mug if you cut the potatos small enough.

This is a nice and mildly spicy chowder.  I did add one extra cup of potatoes.  And since I was out of celery, I sauteed some carrot with the onion.  I did use a can of creamed corn and some frozen corn.  If you don't want the spice just use regular Velveeta instead of the Mexican style.  It's a good recipe and worth trying.

This chowder was exactly what I was looking for! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and increased the diced potatoes to 5 cups, per other reviews. It had a fantastic flavor and I couldn't believe how much texture the gravy added! If you like a thick chowder, this is your recipe!

The first time I made this soup, it was too bland and not thick enough. It was not very chowdery. Next time I made it, I increased the potatoes, added some mushrooms, dissolved some flour with the gravy and finally added 1/2 cup of wine. It actually came out better. It is a good base recipe, needs a lot of doctoring.

Amazing soup. I'm from Canada, crawfish isn't exactly easy to get so I substituded Tiger Prawns and Shrimp for the crawfish. My wife and I are huge garlic fans so I added a head of garlic and it turned out amazing.

This is a delicious chowder that is very easy to make. We've always had potato soup in our family as a "feel better" potion, but we've now decided that this soup will heal us in a jiffy! I make this about every two weeks, and there is never enough left over to freeze!

The spicy flavor of this soup was just right for my family! The hardest part was trying to "shred" the Velveeta- I just ended up cubing it and it melted just fine. Great leftover too! Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to add a can of creamed corn. Whole family likes this one! It stands on its own, but meat eaters would probably love it even more if topped with bacon or sausage.

This was so delicious. I received compliments all around. I added carrots and diced ham to mine. I doubled the corn also: one can of cream style corn and one can of whole corn. I add a little more chicken broth than it calls for because of the additions. Some reviewers are complaining about the richness from the country gravy. Make sure you’re using 2 cups of milk with one packet, rather than the one. You can also add more broth to thin it out.

This is a great recipe. We only made a few changes due to our commitment not to eat foods that have more than 5 ingredients or we can't pronounce - so I made a roux instead of the gravy mix and used some mild shredded cheddar cheese. Very good!

I added just a little raw garlic because of a cold, and there's no doubt in my mind, even without added garlic this is absolutely delicious~ YES, I will make this again, this time using  directions without the added garlic this Wednesday night for "Soup Night" A very special thank you for this delicious soup!

I LOVE making soups and chowders.  This one is an A+ chowder!!  I've added carrots for color... sometimes add some bacon.  I've made it oodles of times, and its perfect every time.  Today, I had left over fried chicken and corn, so just threw the cut-up chicken into it.  As always, Delish!!

I cooked some bacon and used some of the drippings instead of margarine to saute my veggies.  Added the bacon (chopped) with the corn and chiles. It was awesome! Even my picky kiddos gobbled it up! It's on their make again list!

This is SO GOOD! Added about a tablespoon of minced garlic when cooking onion and celery. Also added 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper. Then added 3 strips of crushed bacon. Served with green onion and bacon crumbles on top and garlic cheese biscuits on the side. It was really a good combo!

I've tried this recipe once before and I loved it. Made it again for my family but this time added a clove of minced garlic in with the celery and onions and then added some Italian breakfast sausage and it complimented it so well! Definitely a recipe I'll be keeping around for quite a while.

Excellent. I did not have gravy mix so I used 3tsp of corn starch. I had frozen corn and a can of creamed corn. I only had grated sharp cheddar and pizza cheese. So it sounds like I changed much of the recipe, but I followed the process. I also had to add some salt since I did not use the mix.  Perfect on a rainy winter day in Texas.

A KEEPER!  I will be making this one again, for sure!  I added some cooked chicken.  Taste the soup before adding any seasonings, however.  The Country Gravy mix DOES have pepper in it.  It's fine, but we didn't think it needed more.

The sausage gravy just makes the dish! We had lots of veggies, so at the "add potatos" stage, I also added diced carrots and some cauliflower. My extra touch was using my Cuisenart handheld and puréed 60% of it before adding the milk and corn.  ;)

This chowder is amazing! I've made it twice now and my whole family loves it. The second time I did add some bacon to it and a little extra cheese, but it's fine without it. Perfect for a rainy or cold day dinner.

I took this soup to my son and DIL's football party and it was a huge hit.  I had fresh, newly dug small potatoes, so I did not peel them.  That is the only change I made to the recipe.  We liked this really well the first night, but it got a little thicker the next day for leftovers and that made the soup even better.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this one again.

Loved it! I, too, tweaked the recipe by adding more corn. I used 2 cans of whole kernel corn and one can of creamed corn. I do not like spicy, so I omitted the chiles and substituted shredded seriously sharp cheddar cheese. I followed the rest of the recipe as is and it came out amazing! I will definitely be adding this as one of my favorites!

I hardly ever comment here - but OMG this was fantastic - actually waiting for my second helping to cool. I did change up a few things - wanted a chicken chowder - so I diced some boneless chicken thighs and started the recipe with that, cooked through in butter, not margarine. Also added a little thyme and crushed rosemary to the cooking chicken. Used yellow gold potatoes - skins on. Subbed 1/4 of the milk with buttermilk (had to use it up, so why not).  Skipped the tex-mex ingredients - no chilis and regular Velveeta. Don't add salt until you taste - and I like salt. Excellent!! Not too cheesy though - add more I guess if you're looking for that cheesy overtone. I think it was perfect the way it is.  I definitely will make this again, and again.

Simply delicious! Loved this recipe a lot! I made small modification as follows: sautéed garlic, carrot, and green pepper in addition to the original recipe.  Used skim milk instead of regular milk.  Doubled the amount of corn; one creamy corn, one regular canned corn.  The key for this successful recipe in my opinion is use of processed cheese food (velveeta) and texture of potatoes (in addition to corn).  I was so skeptic about the processed cheese food, but it gave really nice creaminess and some added flavor to the soup :).  I wonder how it would turn out if I used regular cheese, instead of processed cheese, for example, cheddar.  Maybe too greasy?  Not sure.. But this is the recipe that changed my perception about the processed cheese food!! Also I don't usually use instant gravy sauce kind, but in this recipe, I would say it helped the taste better and saved the time to cook.  If I didn't want to use the gravy mix, I could have made my own white sauce with salt & pepper, plus cumin and other herbs with extra 10-20 min or so.  The gravy mix makes the soup base instantly thicker and tasted well, so it makes sense to use especially when you want to make dinner real quick.  Definitely will make more, thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is really amazing, comfort food.  I left out the celery and chiles (as I had neither) and almost doubled the potatoes and liquid.  Simple and fantastic.

I'm a vegetarian so I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth (tasted the same) and I also added a canned of creamed corn to thicken it a bit. Omitted the chiles just for personal preference.. It was perfect. Tasted great with oyster crackers and and it suited my dietary needs without making the rest of my family suffer with a meal that didn't feel complete without meat.

WOOOOW ABSOLUTELY AMAAAZIIIING!!!! I love to tinker with everything I come across, I guess you can call me a "perfectionist". I play with things until they are perfect. I did do a few changes to this, of course. First, I fried 4 pieces of bacon and saved it to crumble over the chowder at serving time. Second, I fried the onion and celery in the bacon grease instead of the margarine. Third, I used HOMEMADE CHICKEN BROTH which I used 4 cups worth because this chowder goes fast in my house of five. fourth, I doubled the country gravy to 2 packages since I doubled the broth. fifth, I omitted the green chiles, and last but not least I added 1 cup of half and half to give it the last touch of perfection...... It is just worth the extra steps....try it, you will be blown away!!!!!

My family and I love this soup!  I only use 1 tablespoon of butter instead of 2 tablespoons of margarine.  I also roast my own Anaheim Chili peppers instead of canned peppers.  I add the cheese and peppers to each individual bowl instead of the whole pot.

This was good.  I didn't need to add anything else.  I used the recipe, scaled up about 150%, and it was great.  Served with fresh baked bread and a couple other types of soup, and it was a hit.  Edit: I didn't even realize it called for processed cheese.  I used Mexican shredded cheese.  FMI, 1 c chopped onion ~= 0.25 large onion.  1 c chopped celery ~= just under 2 stalks.  3 c potatoes ~= 2 nice-sized baking potatoes.  Edit2: This time I used vegetable bouillon for a vegetarian soup.  Also doubled but only had 7 oz can chilies.  Oh, and I drain the corn.

Really really good!
I'm a huge crockpot kinda girl so I followed a few other reviewers tips and the soup came out wonderful.  I baked off some bacon (400 degrees for about 20 minutes)  Put some (about 2 Tbls.) of the bacon grease in the bottom of the (high) hot crock pot, put in the celery & onions.  I added the potatoes & chicked broth  cooked it on high for about 3 hours.  I then added a can of cream corn, regualr corn, 6 oz of Velveeta & used 1 cup milk & 1 cup heavy cream.  Always salt & pepper.  I let it cook for another hour.  Added some shreded cheddar, bacon bits and chives.          Fantastic!

Everyone loved this!! It made enough to fill a dutch oven, and I was told that I needed to make more, as there was only enough leftover for one serving. The amount of cheese can easily be doubled, and my family thinks the idea of adding bacon is a very good one for next time.

Very good, was looking for an alternative to the standard Corn Chowder. I questioned the gravy mix, but it added to the favor without standing out. Will be making this again.

Great recipe, husband said it was the best I've made. I would prefer it without the chiles, I think, but that's just me (I still liked it a lot). Husband, however, wants me to keep the recipe as is.

This was so delicious!! Everyone loved it and went back for seconds. I fried up some bacon to put as a topping along with some green onions. I did put about 3 teaspoons of bacon grease in with the butter. I used half-n-half instead of just milk. Also, I loved the flavor the green chiles gave the soup. I don't think anyone should omit that ingredient. They are not spicy if you get the mild ones. I used the Mexican style velvetta cheese and I couldn't be happier with the results. I would not consider this soup spicy. I will be making this again and I will also be having leftover soup for breakfast tomorrow morning. Yum!! Thanks for the recipe!

VERY tasty soup with a little kick to it! Definitely in my top 3 of this site, and I've been getting recipes from here for years. The first time i made I was a little nervous (gravy?), but trust the process. The results are delicious. Try to find King potatoes or one of the slightly yellow buttery ones, and it will result in a creamier soup.

Loved this soup!  No stores in NY seemed to have "country style gravy mix" so I combined 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp seasoning salt in a pan and browned it.  Then whisked in 2 cups of half & half.  Once that was blended I mixed about half of it into the soup.  (I'd cut the recipe in half next time) It came out perfect.  I also skipped the celery and sauteed the onions in bacon fat, saving the bacon to crumble on the top.  I would DEFINITELY make this again!

Wonderful soup on a cold day!!!  Easy to make with most of the ingredients already on hand. Omitted the green chilies because that's not really our style.  Also use whatever cheese I have in the fridge and some bacon bits (homemade) on top!  YUMMY!!

I added a pound of Itialian Sausage because my husband won't eat anything that doesn't have meat in it, and it was yummy!  Fry a few strips of bacon, then saute your veggies (including corn) in the greese.  Drain and add to the pot.  Didn't have mexican cheese, so I used a can of Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup.  A speed chopper for the meat and veggies made this meal come together in a snap at it was amazingly good!  I wonder if the gravy/cheese/broth soup base would work as a cheesy clam chowder . . .

Great soup. I doubled the recipe, and after the potatoes had cooked, I ladled 2 big scoops out of the pot and pureed it in a food processor. Put it back in and it turned out really rich and thick. Not sure if it needed it... but the soup was delicious. Also, I added some cooked shredded chicken to mine. Everyone loved it! Might add some red pepper flakes or hot sauce to give it a little kick next time

The recipe was EASY and I already had most of the ingredients on hand.  I even added carrots with the onion and celery and leftover peas with the corn.  It tasted great, the green chiles added a kick.  Will probably make again, but maybe will add more cheese next to time to try to make it creamier??

One of the best soups I've ever had! My family goes nuts when I make it and my neighbors raved about it as well. Wouldn't change a thing! Eat with beer bread on a cool fall day - YUM!

I am giving this 5 stars because I had go make do with a different processed cheese because I am living overseas.  i didn't want to knock the soup based on my changes.  With what I had and following someone's suggestion of olive oil (which I think margarine would have been better) I would have given it 3 stars until I stick blended it and then it improved substantially.  It was too thin for me before that, but I think that was partially my cheese choice.  Great idea with the country gravy mix!

This is the best chowder ever! My husband just raved about it!! I did not use the green chiles. Mainly because I did not have any. I did not skimp on anything. I used full fat everything!! This is definitely a keeper.

Really good. Lightened it up a bit with olive oil, skim milk and Weight Watchers mexican cheese and it was still amazing.

AWESOME recipe. The only changes I made to this recipe was adding fritos once served in the bowl and topped with additional cheese. Additionally, instead of using the processed mexican cheese, I substituted a bag of 3 cheese shredded Mexican giving this dish a nice latin flavor! Read: Nacho Soup Meets Corn Chowder :)

My family never likes chowder, but I love it so thought I would try it again. I added bacon to please my husband.  I cooked the bacon with some of the margarine and stirred the vegetables in it.(celery and onion)I also added fresh green beans I needed to use up and cut potatoes in half. My family still did not really care for it, but they did eat it. I loved it Was so good.

I add 1/2 lb of chopped bacon to mine, I never use anything but real cheese sometimes cheddar and other times a fiesta blend of cheeses, I put the chiles in only sometimes and I never use the country style gravy mix, I always just add a few tablespoons of cornstarch to my milk before adding it to the pot. I also brown my veggies in a few tablespoons of the left over bacon fat (really not very good for you, but it's delicious!) I think this is a great recipe and it's easy to add your own twist to suit your own taste!

This soup is fantastic, probably the best corn chowder I've had! I only added one can of sweet cream corn, carrots and mozzarella cheese instead of "processed cheese food". I'm going to go eat it now.

This soup has been a winter staple in my family for the past two years.  Add a few slices of bacon cooked crisp and chopped to the soup for a little extra pizzaz.  Yummy!

fantastic!!  Like other reviewers, I changed it a little for my taste. Instead of the canned chiles I fire-roasted a pasilla chile, diced it up and threw it in....I also used shredded cheddar and jack cheese instead of the velveeta.... and added some bacon.  Turned out great!!

This soup was fantastic. Really creamy and perfect. I added a can of creamed corn and used Velvetta cheese. I think it coud even use another can of whole kernal corn. It hit the spot on a cold winter day.

Wowza. Really good. I don't even want to admit the amount of bowls I had for dinner. I omitted the celery, added a can and a half of cream corn, and split the milk with some heavy cream. Really delicious, hearty chowder. I'd never made a chowder before and was really nervous about the gravy part but it was fantastic. I also used 2% plain velveeta and added rotisserie chicken, as another reviewer recommended. Needed a little salt and pepper in the end. Would recommend and will make again.

I really enjoyed this soup. I omitted the chiles just because I'm not a big fan, and I used two cans of regular corn and one can of creamed corn. I will definitely make this again and will consider adding some chicken next time. Thanks for sharing!

I just finished making this soup and WOW! It's  delicious. I usually follow the recipes exactly as I am not known for my cooking but I did throw some garlic in with the onion and celery and reduced the amount of green chiles (personal preference). Thanks for sharing!

I left out the celery, used 1 cup of frozen corn and 1 15 ounce can of creamed corn, and added 2 cups of carrots. Also used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth and added basil and thyme (discretionary to taste - did not measure). I added cayenne as well, approximately 1/2 tsp to kick it up a notch. With the changes, this was an absolute favorite for my vegetarian boyfriend and I. It will become a dinner staple for sure.

Thumbs up!  This is a great go-to recipe for easy potato soup.  I call these pantry soups because I have most everything in the pantry except the dairy.   Easy and delish , this one will most def show up again.

This is an excellent recipe!  I made a few changes of course.  I made my own stock, doubled the cheese, added in a can of creamed corn, and used a can of evaporated milk in place of the milk (I made a huge double recipe so you'd only need 1/2 a can for a single recipe).  I also used a 1 lb bag of frozen yellow corn and a 1 lb bag of frozen white corn, added in 2 cloves of minced garlic and peppercorn melange.

This was delicious and I wish I had doubled the recipe. I did make a few changes; I added a can of creamed corn and then used 1 cup frozen corn because I never buy corn canned. I used 3 cups chicken broth and 1 cup milk. Instead of the gravy mix I stirred 1 tbsp of corn starch into the milk before adding it to the pot. I also used real cheddar chesse. I used 1 tbsp of dried crushed chili peppers which made it very spicy, next time I will only use 1/2 a tbsp

First, the recipe did not say to drain the corn or not. I did NOT, the soup was very thin, needed something to knock it up a notch.  I even cut back on the milk a bit thinking it was too runny and I put some of the veg's in the blender to make a thickener.  Not that good.......

Great quick and easy recipe.  I used 2% Velveeta and added about a cup of cream cheese to the mix, and it turned out awesome.  Make sure and make plenty,  because you'll want to eat this for a week!

I was asked to make a Corn Chowder for a teacher's luncheon. I've never made a chowder before and was super glad to find this recipe. I did a test run today;  following the recipe exactly. It is perfectly delicious and very easy to make. If my family eats it, it will be a new staple. Wish I found this on the snow days.... Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely scrumptous! I added some cilantro and turkey bacon and used one can of carnation milk, one can of corn and a can of creamed corn. I also omitted the celery, chiles and gravy mix. De-li-cious!

I made this for a holiday gathering and it turned out great! I did make a few of my own additions/adjustments. I made this in a crock pot and threw everything in right away (except the cheese which I added once everything else was heated through). I used creamed corn vs. regular, added some bacon, and added some Instant Potatoes to thicken it up. It got rave reviews from my friends.

I've been looking for a good chowder recipe for a long time, and this definitely took its place as #1. My husband, whose motto should be "moderation," ate three huge bowls full; and my kids, who were a little skeptical at first, thoroughly enjoyed it.  The only thing I changed was to use sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed. We'll definitely be having this again - and I rarely repeat recipes.

This is a family favorite...I found it when I needed to make a soup to bring to church one night and searched for one that was highly rated.  It's great as written, but I have made a few changes over time.  I cut the chiles in half for my kids, and I add diced chicken and canellini (white) beans to the recipe.  This makes it a whole meal.  We serve with a good bakery bread and OhMyGosh is it good!!!  I came back to multiply the recipe to make for 30 guests Thanksgiving week, and realized  I'd never rated it.  5 stars all the way....people beg me for the recipe every single time I make it

This soup was surprising! Very good! I added a can of creamed corn, more potatoes, and garlic to the mix. Quite spicy and thick. I'd rather not use Velveeta as it weirds me out, so next time I'll try regular cheese. But hey, it's still delicious and you can't argue with results. It makes a TON.

I LOVED this recipe. My husband and I had friends over for a soup night... we made a total of 4 soups and this was everyone's FAVORITE!  The only changes I made were adding cream of corn instead of corn... extra cheese... and I doubled the margarine. This has to be one of the best recipes on this site.

This is really, very good (I'm enjoying some leftovers for lunch right now!). I made a few substitutions: olive oil instead of margarine, skin-on red potatoes (and added more than 3 c.), 1 c. milk + 1 c. half-and-half, added a can of creamed corn, and used shredded cheese at the end.  It's quite tasty with a hunk of good bread - and topped with more cheese and some bacon bits!

Great flavor and easy to make.  Only ingredient change I made was to add a can of creamed corn.  One time I was short on time and didn't have time to wait for the potatoes to cook.  After I sauted the onions and celery I put everything in a crock-pot (except the cheese) and cooking on low high for about 6 hours.  I added the cheese during the last 20 minutes or so.  Turned out great.

A good chowder for a cold rainy evening. I took the basic recipe and made a few changes per family preference. I cooked 8 slices of bacon, drained, chopped and set aside. In the bacon drippings I sauted the onion, celery, 2 cloves garlic, 6 sprigs fresh thyme and about 4 small basil leaves chopped. I cut the kernels from 6 ears of fresh, frozen, corn (from the summer) and diced 6 medium sized potatoes. To a large sauce pan I transfered the celery/onion mixture, added about 4 cups chicken broth and brought to a boil. After reducing the heat I added 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2, potatoes and corn and cooked, till the potatoes were soft, about 8-10 minutes. I then put about 2-3 cups of the potato/corn mixture in a blender and blended till smooth and creamy. I added this back to the sauce pan with the remainder of the chowder. The blended corn and potatoes gave the chowder a thick rich consistency (I did not use the gravy packet). I added about 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley just prior to ladleing into individual bowls. This was served with shredded sharp cheddar, chopped bacon and scallions, sour cream (each to be added per taste) and fresh baked sour dough bread.

Oh my gosh this is so good!  I thought the combination of chilies and gravy mix would be odd.  Oh but to the contrary!!  Everyone in my house gives this one a big 5 stars.  It was exactly what I was looking for, tastes just like (maybe better) than the corn chowder from the sandwich shop.

Delicious, fast, and budget-friendly! Even my kids ate it. I made a few changes- I used 2 cans of potatoes,instead of fresh, which cut the cooking time down by 18 minutes, and I used 2 cups of cheese instead of one.

I am SO impressed with this recipe, it is probably the best soup I've ever made! The only changes I made were to use vegetable broth instead of chicken, skip the celery, and add a small can of creamed corn. I also didn't peel the potatoes. This soup is so delicious! It is just as good left over too. Thanks so much!!

I LOVE this recipe. It's rich and creamy, with plenty of body. I have even made it using leftover mashed potatoes instead of the diced potatoes, and it was hearty and delicious. For those of us spicy food lovers, a couple dashes of good hot sauce just makes it perfect! Thanks for a great soup recipe!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  It was a cold and yucky day here yesterday and this was just what my husband and I needed!  I threw in some leftover rotisserie chicken that I had and topped it off with bacon. Great with a big sourdough roll. Mmmmm.  A new staple in our house!

This is one of the best potato soups I have made!  It was a big hit at the get-together I served it at last night; I almost didn't get any!  From looking at other comments, I made a few changes.  I added three cloves of garlic, which I sauteed up at the beginning, used a leek instead of the onion, substituted half of the milk with half and half, and used frozen corn since I realized i had run out of canned corn!  Thank you for this great recipe, I would have never thought of using a country gravy in a soup!  This will definitely be made again in our family :)

This was pretty good... The chiles give it a real mexican flavor. I made it twice this week. Once with the chiles and once without. The chiles really add to the recipe. Otherwise, it tastes too bland. I will only make this when I'm serving other mexican food.

We love this recipe. It comes out so thick and delicious. At first, the mixture came out runny, but I think that's because we didn't measure something right. But following the recipe exactly as it says makes a delicious and easy chowder.

Yummy!!!  Even though the temps outside are 90+, it was a delicious treat for dinner!  I omitted the chile's as I'm not fond of their taste, may substitute a Serrano chile next time (pull it out on serving!).  Used half & half since I didn't have enough milk and totally forgot about the cheese.  Like another, used the simply potatoes from the produce section.  Makes me wonder now if a russet would just disintegrate while cooking?  This is a definite keeper, thanks for sharing!

Yum. That about sums it up! I've made it once using velveeta and once using shredded colby/jack. All of us prefer the shredded cheese versus the processed. It's good either way though.

This soup was excellent.  I did not add the chiles or use the Mexican cheese because I wanted a more basic soup. The gravy mix was such a simple and clever way to give the soup a rich, creamy, and flavorful taste.  This will be a great soup base to play around with.

Great chowder!  Only one thing I recommend:  Add the cheese to the chowder on an individual basis(to each serving instead of the whole batch).  This way it'll reheat better if you have any left.  Also you can control the consistency and amount of cheese in your serving. sauteed the onion and celery separately in a little bacon fat(just my preference, not required) and used that pan to make the gravy.  Worked like a charm.

This was just ok. Not much flavor. I could not find the country style gravy at the store so subsitued w/ a creole white gravy. Maybe that's the problem?

This soup was fantastic. I was skeptical because of the weird combo of ingredients (gravy mix?), but it really was easy and tasted great. I may try the shredded cheddar instead of the velveeta--that stuff just scares me--but it sure tasted good.

This is a great recipe!  We didn't have velveeta, so I used finely grated cheddar, and it worked just fine.  My husband and I loved it, and I plan to make it for company tonight.

This soup is awesome!  Much better than I expected considering there are not that many spices.  The gravy mix gave it a nice creamy flavor.  I add a box of frozen chopped spinach (to sneak in a green vegetable) and a can of cream-styled corn (to bulk it up a bit.)  This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe!!  I used the frozen vegetable blend instead of fresh, canned milk (didn't have the skimmed or I would have used that), no-fat gravy mix, and a low-fat mexican blend shredded cheese.  This cut a lot of fat, and it was still wonderful.

So So Yummy!  Easy to make-used sweet frozen corn instead but, it was great!  Even my picky husband loved it-and if it doesn't have meat he usually isn't a fan!  It will be a new family favorite especially in the winter! :)

This was great the first go around and even better as leftovers. The only change I made was using sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed cheede. For the leftovers I added some crumbled cooked bacon pieces. I can't wait to make this again!!

This was a fabulous base recipe with good "bones". The country gravy was a good lower fat way to thicken. I left out the potatoes and cheese. I added green chiles, a bit of red pepper and get this .. 1/2lb or more of real lump crab meat. I served in a pretty bowl with a tablespoon or so of crab meat, fresh chopped green scallions, fresh ground pepper and a tablespoon or so of monterrey jack cheese. It is super and my husband can not get enough of it.

This was a good base, but the end product was a little bland for those of us who love spice.  I ended up adding some shredded rotisserie chicken, garlic powder, seasoning salt, course ground pepper and cayenne pepper.  My husband who is a potato soup freak said he thought it was a nice change from regular potato soup and said he would definitely eat it again.

One of the bests recipes I have come along!  My family can't get enough of this great chowder.  Fast and easy...and so darn good!  Just to make it easier (as if it couldn't get any easier)....I pick up fresh diced potatoes in my grocery store to use instead of doing it myself.  If you're in Texas and have HEB...check it out.

I somtimes omit the mexican cheese and green chilies and substitute bacon and regular Velveeta.  I add some green onions and it's Baked Potato Soup.

This was fabulous! It's got a little kick to it so, if that's not your thing than don't try this one.
I followed the recipe (almost) exactly because I was making it for company and it was also my first time trying it but, next time I will probably make this one a lot more healthy by finding a substitute for the gravy mix and using real cheese.

yum yum. i thought this soup would be bland but it was really tasty. Must be the gravy mix that seasons it up. I wasn't sure how many potatoes makes 3 cups so i just used 5 or 6 of those little yukon gold guys. I suppose you could add more or less and it would still be great. Pair it with a yummy bread machine bread and you've got a great cold weather meal!

This is one of my favorite all time recipes.  I use two cans of creamed corn and a small bag of frozen sweet corn.  Also, I normally add a couple chopped chicken breasts.  And the most important addition of all:  cayenne pepper!  I add about 2-4 tsps after the cheese.  The spicy food lovers in my house request this chowder at least once a month.  The pepper is a great balance against the sweet corn flavor.

This was really good, I left out the green chiles, celery, and used regular Velveeta cheese.

Just average, very bland.  I had to add some garlic, pepper, parsley, cayenne, and salt.  Not worth the calories that come with all of the cheese.  I'll stick to my homemade potato soup.

This soup was excellent.  I did do some modifications to this recipe.  Instead of two cans chicken broth, I used 1 can chicken broth and 1 can vegtable broth.  I also added carrots to this.  This was easy to make and I will definately make it again.  It was a huge success

This was fantastic! Just had another bowl for lunch. I went with the Bacon garnish which add a nice twist, but my thing was I cooked the bacon in my soup pot first then put it aside for later. Then I sauteed the onion and celery in the bacon fat not the margarin then I just followed the repie from there.

This was very quick and yummy!!  I cooked the diced potatoes in the broth with a whole onion and celery stalk. I like the flavor, the girls are iffy about onions and celery, this way I can leave it out.  I used one can of creamed corn and one can of regular corn. I omitted the chili's and used velveta mexican cheese.  This was comfort food!!

Yum and very easy.  I didn't add celery because I don't like the cooked taste and used regular shredded cheese instead of cheese food.  Got compliments from a New Englander!

This recipe is a great reason why I love this site.  The amount of great reviews is why I chose this soup over others.  I am glad I did.  It was wonderful.  I took others advice & modified it accordingly.  I used half & half instead of milk, added another can of corn, used diced potatoes in a can (you can save 25 minutes if you do this!) and used probably twice the recommended cheese.  I used finely shredded four cheese mix and added real store bought bacon pieces (Hormel or whoever).  My 10 yr old, 7 yr old & 3 yr old loved it. My 5 yr old didnt.  It made a great size batch for my family of 6 with a little to store & share with friends.  I will DEFINITELY be making this recipe again...maybe adding asparagus next time.  EXCELLENT!!!

This soup was just okay.  It was plenty thick, but needed a bit more flavor.  I added a bit more cheese and freshly ground pepper.  My kids wouldn't eat it.  I won't make it again, but it appears that I am the minority.

I froze this in containers for a family whose dear 14-year-old daughter died.  It was the middle of a harsh winter.  They found the soup to be a nourishing comfort food and even asked me for the recipe -- what higher praise can one receive?  I added a bit of shredded carrot for color and used a combination of skim milk and evaporated milk.

Em Em good.  Family loved this recipe.  I did make just a couple of changes.  Added an extra cup of diced potatoes and an extra can or corn.  Also used whole milk.  This was perfect served with biscuits, salad and for dessert, the "Best Ever Unbaked Cherry Cheesecake" found in Allrecipes.  Wonderful winter meal.

This chowder is the best. The gravy mix really does add alot. My kids all like this alot, and it's my hubby's favorite. He can never stop at just one bowl. I do add turkey bacon(out of habit). Sometimes we do jalapenos instead of the chilis, just depends what is on hand. I always tinker with recipes, but th original recipe is worthy of 5 stars. Thanks so much!!

Wonderful recipe!  I didn't have green chilies and was serving it to children anyway, so omitted that.  I'm trying to cook more from scratch, so made the white gravy instead of using a packet.  It was a little on the salty side but very delicious!

I cooked the onion in four slices of bacon to add more flavor and used salt-free whole kernel (water and all) and creamed corn. I forgot to add the green chiles, but I don't think it mattered, because the soup was great. I like the gravy envelope-- what a great idea! It added a thickness to the soup. Froze well, too.

This is a wonderful soup. However, I cannot imagine using regular chicken broth with it...WAAAY too much sodium. Use low-sodium chicken broth and you'll be much happier. Also, I'll probably use a second can of corn next time. Oh and pepper, a little extra pepper ads extra flavor. But overall this is a 5 star soup!

Awesome!  Really filling and warm on a cold night.  I made a few changes to adjust to my liking.  I left out the chiles (not really a fan).  Used half and half instead of milk.  I think I'll just stick to the milk next time, it seems pretty rich.  Added a can of creamed corn and increased the potoatos.  It made a ton.  Will try to freeze as some reviewers have done.

Amazing!  I left out the celery (really don't like it) and replaced with sliced baby carrots.  Used a can of corn as well as a can of creamed-style corn per other reviews - I highly recommend others do the same (I'm not sure it would have had quite the same chowder-y consistency and taste otherwise).  Also used light regular velveeta, a couple shakes (or 12) of paprika and a few dashs of cayenne.  So yummy and FILLING!  We definitely ate less of this than other soups/stews because we were just so full - but that just means more for leftovers!  :o)  Thank you!

Family liked it just as recipe was written. I think the suggestion to add a can of creamed corn is good, and some crumbly bacon would be excellent too. Makes a nice big batch.

This was my first attempt at any kind of chowder... It turned out great and made so much more than I thought it would.  I made it for my boyfriend, but my best friend and her boyfriend came over last minute and there was plenty to go around; I even had leftovers.  I used creamed corn as some of the other reviewers suggested, and I also used regular processed cheese instead of the spicy kind.  To add a little kick, I did put in cajun spices, and it turned out great - not too spicy, but definitely not bland at all!  I'll be making this again this season... it's a great "chilly day" soup:)

This was heaven in a bowl! I love thick creamy soups and chowders so I tried this although I was questioning the ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a new favorite soul-warming dish. This is nicely spicy without overkill and you can easily add to the recipe to accomodate your palate. Mmmmm

This was good, but I felt like it lacked something.  I think I may try it with a little bacon next time.

Ohhh, this is a good one!  I followed the recipe as is, except I added a handful of frozen peas about 10 min. before it was ready.  Very flavorful and yummy!!  Will make again!

This is an amazing chowder.  I made it last night and my husband couldn't get enough.  It was even better for lunch the next day.  I added some shredded chicken, which was so yummy!!!

Great chowder!  I added one can of whole kernal and one creamed as others suggested.  I love the fact it has ingredients that I usually have on hand and it cooks up fairly fast.  Will make this often this winter.

Very good! I doubled the corn; used one can of creamed corn and one can of whole kernel corn.  It made a ton- I have 6 bowls in my freezer for those cold winter days! Excellent and VERY filling!

This was a good recipe to add anything you want to add on.  I added cooked bacon after I put in the potatoes.  This gave it a wonderful taste!  Instead of a can of kernal corn, I put in a can of creamed corn. I will do this next time too!!  I was leery about putting in the green chilies, but I think they added a lot to the flavor along with the gravy!!  Thanks for this recipe!!!

Made this last night and it was delicious! I am usually terrible at making soups but this was a great success! Made some changes... Used 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of real bacon bits to cook celery and onion. Added two cups cubed cooked chicken. Used fat free milk and added 4 dashes of cayanne pepper for color and heat. Awesome!

We more used this recipe as a jumping-off point for improvisational cooking, and it turned out great!  We used vegetarian brown gravy mix, shredded cheddar and monterray jack cheeses and an extra can of corn like someone else suggested.  Our guests all asked for the recipe.  It went very well with fresh-baked honey wheat bread, too.

This was excellent, thank you Jackay.  I used whipping cream instead of one cup of the milk, almost a cup more on the potatoes, used regular cheese instead of "cheese food" and added a can of cream corn.  This is wonderful cold weather food, and good anytime of the year.

We absolutely loved this soup!  It really hit the spot on a cold snowy Cleveland day!  I did add 3/4 can of evaporated milk to make it richer!  Thanks for the great recipe, Jackay!

This was a Great Chowder.  I've added a bit to it by cooking 1/2 lb of chopped up bacon in the bottom of the pot first, and then draining off most of the grease and cooking the vegetables in the little bit of remaining bacon grease.  I also add a can of creamed corn to the recipe, and use heavy cream in place of milk.  And use shredded mexican cheese instead of the processed kind.  You end up with a thicker, much more flavorful chowder.  Everyone who tries it loves it and always wants more.

This was very good... When I make it again, I will probably cut the chiles down to half the can- It was pretty spicy, and the leftovers were even spicier.  I also thought it might be good with chicken next time.  I couldn't find "Mexican-style processed cheese", so I just sprinkled shredded cheddar on the top of each serving.  I served it with garlic cheese biscuits.  Good and easy! Thanks!

I've tried rating this recipe for a long time and it never makes it through for some reason.  

I LOVED this recipe.  I actually took the best of what I considered from two recipes, this one and another called Vegetable Chowder.  I must say though, I generally kept the guts of this recipe and picked out only a couple things from the other chowder recipe.

I haven't made this in quite a while, and I'm waiting for it to cool down again, maybe another 10 degrees ((laughs)) hot here in TX before making this again.

Wow! This is full of flavor thanks to the gravy mix and green chilis. I used brown gravy mix in place of the country gravy and received rave reviews. This will definately be put in regular rotation in our family. Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe although I think that next time I will increase the amount of potatoes from 3 c. to 5 cups. and maybe even add more corn and cheese also. There was just too much 'liquid' than vegetable with given measurements to follow. Also, my family thought it may also be even better with some crispy bacon pieces added to the soup. It's a keeper, just needs a little "doctoring up" :o)

This is an easy and great recipe to prepare when you want a quick, comforting meal.  I used skim milk to cut back on the fat and regular mexican cheese rather than the processed kind.  I also kept the skin on the potatoes and sauteed some diced chicked in garlic before adding it to the soup.  This is a winner!!

Delicious soup, however, I wish it were spicier.  I used Mild
Mexican Kraaft cheese food.  Next time I will try adding
a few shots of Tabasco or ground pepper.  It needs some
extra zest, as shown it is tasty but a little too bland.

This was so amazing.
Everyone loves it.
I give it 10 stars.
The only thing I changed was 1/2 can chili peppers 
Instead of a whole can because I had young children eating .
I am adding it to my favorites and my friends are requesting the recipe.

Yes, I used 1 1/2 cans of creamed corn instead and did not add celery.  It is great chowder and I will make it again.

Very Good made exactly as written.  With two small changes, this might be the best pot of soup I've ever made!!  Instead of regular country gravy mix,  I used 1/2!! of a 2.75oz package of Pioneer Brand SAUSAGE country gravy mix.  It does not have sausage bits.   As finished soup simmers,  add 1/2 cup white wine or more to taste.  I used Savignon Blanc.   But any acid addition could be used, ie. lemon juice or even a small amount of rice wine or apple cider vinegar.  It definitely needs the acid.  I like to brown the onions and celery in bacon fat first and be sure to add salt when potatoes are added to the broth. Potatoes, like pasta have to cook in the salt or, no matter how much salt you add after cooking, they'll never have flavor. 
Yes, this recipe has lots of fat but for special occasions, this can't be beat.  Outstanding!!

I made this without the cheese. I added chopped asparagus at the halfway point of cooking the potatoes too. When complete I put about half the soup in an immersion blender, which considerably thickened it. It also screamed for black pepper and I added some at the end.

It makes a very hearty soup. Perfect for a cold day.

This was a great, easy recipe that I tweaked just a bit. First, i cooked three slices of bacon, removed all but two tbsp of fat, and sautéed the onions and celery in it. I also added a small pkg of diced ham after the potatoes had been simmering, along with the precooked bacon. Finally, I was able to find a gluten free country gravy mix that i mixed with the milk. Everyone loved this soup!

This chowder was easy to make and had lots of flavor. I thought the peppers were going to make it spicier but just added the right amount of flavor. I was hoping that it would come out a bit thicker.    Served garlic bread as a complement to the chowder. Got rave reviews from all that ate it.

The whole family loved this recipe! I took a suggestion from one of the reviewers and added a half pound of bacon (grease drained) to the original recipe. The bacon makes a big difference and truly enhances the recipe.

I made this exactly to the recipe.  It was very good.  Husband loved it.  Only 4 stars because of the processed ingredients.  Season your bowl with black pepper sparingly as it ramps up the heat more than you would think.

I agree that the gravy mix made the soup too thick and I would go along with the roux instead. Also some may prefer a cutting back on the chilies.Otherwise great recipe. It was voted as a do again.

My husband asked for a second bowl!
I didn't have the gravy mix, so I made a roux ( 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup flour) and reduced the milk to one cup.  I will definitely be making this again and will add some crispy bacon as other reviewers have recommended.

Delicious and easy!  I left out the celery and chiles and used green onions and canned potatoes, so it was very fast to put together.  I would definitely make again.

Easy and delicious! Love that everything is already on hand...especially to make on a cold day. My daughter isnt big on celery so I can always get behind a recipe that disguises it. Recipe lends itself to being extremely versatile, will definitely make it with bacon next time.

So good. I didn’t follow the recipe 100% but pretty much.  I used everything the same except I added chopped garlic with the celery, onion, and butter. Then when I added the corn I added cubed zucchini. Turned out amazing

Absolutely a soup to make on a chilly fall day . I will be using the base of the chowder for my fish chowder for sure. I would put two cups of potatoes and two cups of out right from the garden corn next time.   you can take corn  right off the cob without cooking and freeze it in you Food Saver bags...cook as you would when you buy frozen at the store

Made it. Didn't have celery so omitted. Not a big bacon fan so used some bacon fat while cooking onions and used cut pieces of ham. Used a fresh jalapeno small diced and fresh corn off cob. Cooked whole cobs in broth to add extra flavor. Less milk mostly about 1 C half n half. Lots of cheese at end in soup for more cheesy soup.

Fabulous!  Really good and made plenty for leftovers!  I added a can of creamed corn and had a few extra potatoes to use up so I ended up with closer to 5 cups and it turned out great.  Also used a whole onion  (gotta use things up!) and minced garlic.  Thank you for a great recipe-will definitely make again!  Oh, and don’t be afraid of the Velveeta—I used an entire small block and it was the bomb!

Loved it as did the entire family.  Even my 91yr old Mother-In-Law who asked for more!  Made it as it states.  For the corn I used frozen corn, instead of 1/2 & 1/2 I used 2% milk.

It was great! I was nervous that it wouldn't be flavorful because the recipe didn't call for a lot of spices, but it turned out delicious! I didn't use the chiles but I kept everything else the same.

Love love love this! I’ve made it twice now, and the second time I doubled the recipe (was giving some to my in-laws) and added about 2# of bacon and used 1 can of corn, and 1 can of cream corn. Defiantly a favorite! Defiantly going to recommend this recipe to friends!

Oh My Goodness... this was delicious! I did add a cup of carrots to the veggies, used vegetable broth (my daughter is a vegetarian) and instead of velveeta cheese I used shredded cheddar cheese. My whole family has asked for this to go on the dinner rotation. Thank you for this receipe!! ?

Didn’t have margarine, celery, onions, or chili’s.  Used 1 quart box of broth and 1 pound red baby potatoes. Also didn’t have country gravy mix, had turkey gravy packet, a little smaller in size. Came out awesome, I thought. Probably could have blended half the potatoes with broth after they cooked in order to get a more chowder-y consistency.

This has been my favorite recipe for a few years now. The only modification i made was adding bacon and ham. And just using the oil from the bacon instead of using margerine.

I was curious about this recipe but wasn't able to find the gravy mix. I searched online for a homemade recipe for the gravy mix and this is how I made that.
 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 tablespoon garlic salt
1/4 tablespoon black pepper, freshly ground
1/4 tablespoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/8 teaspoon rubbed sage
I sifted it through a sieve to mix. 
I followed the rest of the recipe as written. It's different from the other corn chowders but we enjoyed it for a change.

I used dairy free butter instead of margarine, almond milk instead of cow's milk, and real cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese listed in the ingredients. I also added another whole can of corn- I felt for a corn chowder, 1 can just wasn't enough. I used the multi-colored roasting potatoes instead of regular Russet just to give the chowder some color, I feel these potatoes don't break apart as easily either. All in all the recipe is really tasty!

I have made this before & never rated it so here goes! Sadly they do not make Mexican Velveeta anymore. SO today I used regular Velveeta (6 oz) & added 1 T chicken taco seasoning. I will try the Mexican shredded real cheese next time! I did not have any celery & did not want to go  to the store just for that, so subbed 2 carrots. Used veggie broth cubes plus water. I'm a wimp & hate "too spicy" so half a can of chilies works for me. And I ALWAYS use frozen organic corn from Costco!!! YUM This recipe rocks!!!!!

I shredded some cooked rotisserie chicken & may leave out the chilis next time. Otherwise, it's too die for!

Very flavorful, a touch spicy with the green chilies (maybe try a little less next time). Boiled potatoes separately from sauce mixture. Brought sauce to a boil and thickened it before adding the pre-cooked potatoes. Added potatoes and cheddar cheese at end, after it's thickened. Try adding mild sausage.

I doubled the recipe as we never have enough for left overs.  I followed the idea of another review to add 1lb bacon and sauté the veggies in the bacon drippings before adding to the pot.  I let it all cook in the crock pot for 4-6 hrs, then when the potatoes are tender I add the gravy mix (generally all I have is sausage flavor) and let that simmer for another 30min. I halved the milk with heavy cream.  I melt the cheese in right before I serve.   Definitely not a "low cal" version, but "comfort food" rarely is! I have made this several times and have had to use plain velveeta but do agree that the Mexican velveeta tastes best.  It's harder to find at my small grocery, but jalapeño processed cheese works well too.

I've been making this chowder for years now. I use 2 cups of shredded Mexican blend cheese instead of processed cheese. It's a definite comfort food. Great for cold weather. I usually serve it with corn bread. Everyone loves it. The chilies add umph without too much heat Don't leave them out!

I used veg oil instead of margarine and high quality beef bouillon, and water instead of chicken broth. Instead of the cheese I grated sharp cheddar over the soup before serving and added crumbled bacon. To make the soup thick I took a few tablespoons of the potatoes from the ready soup, blended them and added back to the pot.

Fantastic!  I made it with chicken, and omitted potatoes because I discovered I was out of them.  Added a little flour to thicken it at the end.  I used a combo of butter and olive oil because margarine is yucky and terrible for you.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe well exceeded my expectations!! The hubby and I LOVED it!! Followed others suggestions of 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy cream, along with a can of kernel corn and a can of cream corn. I couldn't find the Mexican style velveeta so I just used the original in block form. Lastly I added some diced ham and it was delish! Throw in some Italian bread for dipping and you have a good meal for the week!

I used frozen southern style hash browns and frozen corn.  I didn't have any Mexican velveeta, so used regular.  I substituted 1/2 cup of flour for the gravy mix.  All around easy and excellent chowder.

Amazing and delicious. I did not use the chills and substituted carrots sliced, I used two cans of corn for a thicker chowder and will add shredded cheddar on top when served. So good on this cold November 1, 2014. The rest of the recipe I did not change. I highly recommend.

Made this chowder today . As some of the other viewers did, I added chicken and bacon. Best chowder I have ever made. So glad I doubled the recipe. Sure it will be even better tomorrow as the flavors marry together.

Followed this recipe almost to a T:
EXCEPT, (I cooked the yellow onion, celery, and potatoes and a boil for almost the first 10 minutes until potatoes got soft, then continuing on into a boil with the rest of the items - TIME CRUNCH)
-Guesstimated on 19oz of chicken broth with 13oz and 1/2 of a 13 oz carton of reduced sodium 
-used 2% milk
-used red potatoes
-used 4 cheese mexican shredded cheese.

There was a sort of dryness to the taste, and i felt like it needed a bit of sweetness. 
Reading from another review, I added about 1 big tablespoon of Texas Pete hot sauce. 

!*PERFECT*!

I made some alterations, used 4 cups turkey stock (turkey base) added a cup of carrots, and 1 lbs of Black Forest Ham.  This has by far been my favorite chowder period, hands down.

I was thrilled to find a corn chowder recipe that was simple yet hearty. I used chicken stock instead of broth, 2 cans of corn, added a jar of Old English Cheese Spread instead of the Mexican Style cheese, used condensed milk and did add some garlic and pepper. Quite tasty, and very simple!

This was delicious!

I made this for my fiance, who informed me that he'd never had corn chowder before. I wanted a recipe that would satisfy both of us and this looked like a winner. I was not disappointed!

I followed the recipe as written but made one small change - I made my own country gravy as I do not like the mix.

Great recipe. Came together easily, excellent taste and consistency. Couldn't ask for more!

I made this as written and its great.  It didn't say what milk to use, I used a 2% milk and it still came out creamy.  I think next time I might try adding bacon to this.

I didn't find it as tasty or as creamy as I expected. It was relatively easy to make. It says to use a large sauscepan, however I used a kettle and glad I did. It was more than half full when I was done.

Absolute best recipe for potato and corn chowder!  I go a little crazy when I make this and add more potatoes and chicken broth than called for (we love to have leftovers of this soup to eat for days).  Instead of one can of regular canned corn I put it one can of creamed corn and one can of fiesta corn.  I think I also about double (sometimes triple) the amount of cheese the recipe calls for...so good!!!

This was so delicious. For added flavor I smoked the potatoes and the corn first and it gave it a nice smoky flavor. I also used fat free half and half for the milk and 2% Velveeta to reduce the fat. I served it at a dinner party and everyone asked for left overs to take home.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  The gravy mix makes it a lot thicker than I'd like.  It needs the chilis to keep it from being too bland.  But still a very good chowder. Will definately do this again.

This was a delicious surprise! I was worried that the green chiles would make it a little odd and too spicy, but it have it just enough kick! I also did not see Mexican Velveeta so I used Jalapeño Velveeta and it turned out beautiful. Great creamy taste, filling, and will be great tomorrow for lunch! ;-)

Tried this recipe tonight and it came out great! I'm not supposed to eat spicy foods (heart disease and high blood pressure) so I had my doubts about the chiles but it came out perfect! Not too spicy. This recipe will definitely be one I will be making from now on, and maybe next time I will add some bacon or chicken.

This recipe was phenomenal- I was a little weary about the Country Gravy addition- but it was excellent! I added chicken and an extra can of chicken broth- this will most definitely be our new cold day comfort food!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as it is except I added about 1 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken and some crumbled bacon.  I would make this again as my entire family enjoyed it.

This corn chowder is fabulous. After reading the other reviews I did add a can of creamed corn and used 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy cream. It did come out thick and therefore great comfort food in cold weather. I may try it with all milk next time cause there definitely will be a next time. The chilis gave it a nice little kick. Thanks for a great recipe!

I really like this chowder. Great for chilly days. My family loves it too. I add cut up kielbasa or sausage or bacon... Very good, I think the gravy mix brand makes a difference McCormick brand is my favorite.

YUMMMM! I added pepper jack cheese as someone mentioned in the reviews instead of the processed cheese and I didn't have any gravy mix, so I added 2T of rice flour (suggested, too).  I also added a few filets of leftover walleye and this chowder is amazing!!  Thank you for the recipe!! Will definitely make again.

All I did to make this Gluten Free for me was substitute the Gravy mix with 2 T. rice flour.  I made it the first time with Pepper Jack cheese instead of the 'cheese food' because that's what I had.  Delicious.  The last couple of times I've used grated cheddar and that is wonderful, too.  Great recipe.

Oh boy! What's not to love about this chowder? I took the advice of another reviewer who used frozen O'Brien potatoes. I also put it in the slow cooker. I had to give the recipe to every guest at the party and I immediately pinned it to my pinterest board.

It was really good, not thick but still really good. I added a chicken breast to it and shredded that, also some diced green peppers since I didnt have any green chiles on hand, and used turkey gravy which didnt make a difference we thought. 
Hubby loved it, thats what counts!

I've made this several times now and it's become a family favorite. Because I'm vegetarian I use veggie broth instead of chicken. I also use frozen corn and home made gravy. This soup has plenty of flavor and always turns out yummy.

Perfect.  Easy.  Fast.  Good.  Used no cheese - tasted better.  I just didn't like it with the cheese.  It's now a regular item in our weekly dinner menu.

I just finished making this and my first time making chowder anything,
turned out great I did have to make my own breakfast gravy as they dont carry it where I live. I looked up one here and used that.
I will make this again as it NEEDS ham or something!

Its a very good base! If you have some imagination you can use this to make all sorts of different variations. I found it a bit dull if you enjoy lots of spice but its very open to customize! I mixed things up with my second batch. I added some bacon and brocolli and it turned out good!

This recipe is amazing. You can do so much with it or make it just like the recipe. I added fresh Jalapeno's, Cumin and Chipotle hot sauce for a kick. Serve it with fried corn tortillas on the top.

I added chopped carrots, shredded cabbage,diced cauliflower and reduced the potatoes to suit my taste. The milk gravy mix is a great way to make a creamy chowder. Thank you for that tip!

This was so surprisingly good! I roasted 3 peppers myself as opposed to using (flavorless) canned so it was nice and spicy. I also used evaporated milk for part of the milk since I was running low on it. And I used a mixture of cheddar and pepper jack since I didn't have velveeta. I will make this many more times!

We love this! I added a touch of tabasco sauce and some salt and pepper. Added extra potatoes and some carrots because we love lots of veggies and it turned out great! Everyone always loves it. Sometimes we add sautéed chicken breast if my husbands feels like some meat in his soup. Then it's just like Chicken corn chowder! Yummm!

Made this today and it is fantastic!  I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, omitted the celery and added 2 tbsp jalapenos and it was just the right amount of sweetness and spice I was looking for.

Used 2% milk and 2% cheddar - left out chili's (would have been great but company coming that wouldn't have eaten them) and added some diced carrots and a little broccoli just for fiber.  Also had a smoked chicken thigh in the fridge that I shredded up and added.  Between the extra fiber and protein I added, and the lower fat dairy products, the soup actually came in at very low points for a chowder (WW).  Kudos - I don't mind making a roux, but the country gravy mix works excellently in this soup and as I pick up several when they go on sale, this will be a regular winter rotation.  
Oh - I added fresh corn instead of cannned - I just added it and the broccoli halfway through the potato cooking time. The carrot I sauteed with the onion and a little garlic at the beginning.  YUM!

I tried it and loved it!  The next time I made it, I added canned crabmeat and some fresh jalapeno peppers from the garden.  Made a kickin crab chowder that was wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe that you can do so many things with!!

We love this soup- I make only minor changes. I'm not a big fan of corn so I usually omit that and in a rush frozen potatoes obrien work great in this. I also always make this in the crockpot. It makes it easier to keep it heated for the amount of time that you keep coming back for more- and you will.

My family loved the chowder.  I added a few slices of pepperjack cheese too,  for the extra heat and a few more potatoes.  I used two smoked chops that I cubed up and added at the end for some meat.

We really enjoyed this chowder. We had fresh corn on the cob, 5 ears, that we used. I had a box of chicken broth so it was about 3-4 oz more than recipe called for. And my diced chilis were a 7 oz can so a few more of those also. Wasn't sure what country style gravy mix was but I found one that was a little larger of a package and it worked out fine. Last but not least we used Velveeta because I could not find a processed cheese food that was Mexican and shredded. We would make this again for sure.

Delicious! We don't usually eat spicy food so I was hesitant to use the chilis, but they added a great flavor to this soup. Next time I will add another can of corn, there wasn't quite enough for my taste with just 1.

Delicious chowder that is easy to make. You can cut the prep time down by using frozen pre-chopped onions and celery. I added a bit of crumbled bacon right before serving for a tad more flavor.

It was pretty good.  The only thing I did differently is add minced carrots.  I think next time I will try chicken or brown gravy instead of the country gravy and add chicken.

Excellent  soup. I doubled the ingredients but it would have been plenty anyway. We left out the chilies and mexican velveeta using regular velveeta instead. We had bacon bits for on top, scallions, croutons. Served with garden salad and garlic bread!! Wonderful!

I loved this! It was just a bit spicy for me, but there isn't much that isn't. I used olive oil instead of butter and added bacon but otherwise followed the recipe perfectly. It had great flavor and was nice and thick and creamy! Yummy!

DELICIOUS! I also made a few changes according to other reviews that I read before I made it. I used regular shredded mexican cheese instead of the processed cheese. I also used half and half instead of milk for a thicker chowder. I used 2 cans of cream corn in place of the kernel corn. Served in a bread bowl and had PLENTY of leftovers! Its a keeper!

This chowder is very good! I was looking for a new soup recipe when I came across this, so I thought I would give it a try. I used 1 can whole kernel corn and 1 can Mexicorn, and omitted the chilies. I also fried 5 strips of bacon, and sauteed the onions in in the grease. I sat aside the bacon (which I crumbled) and used as a garnish, along with some chopped greed onions. It was perfect for a cold winter night. I will definitely make it again.

oh my this is amazing.  I like others added a can of cream corn and 1 cup of diced ham that I had fried in with the onions and celery.  I used whole milk.  I only used half of the can of green chilies.  It pleased my entire picky family.

Yummm, my new favorite recipe!   Made a few changes as others suggested...cooked down the celery and onion with the green chiles and also threw in some shredded carrots.  Also threw in a can of creamed corn.  Used white mexican velvetta and 2% milk velvetta mixed, about half a block of each.  Never usually use velvetta, but it was great.  Thinking I might used shredded chedder and mont. jack next time instead, just to see.

I have been looking for a good potato soup recipe and here it is! It is so easy to make!  I quirked it a bit though.  I cooked up bacon bits to sprinkle on the top and used the tablespoon of the grease to cook the celery and onion; used 2 cups of whipping cream and 2 cups of milk; 1 can of creamed corn and 1 can of whole kernel corn, and shredded monterey jack cheese since I had it in the fridge already.  KIDS LOVED IT!  They said there were not enough and it should be doubled next time.

This was my first time making this recipe. My family loved this cowder. It was easy to make. I added shredded cheese and crumbled croutons on top when I served the chowder to my family. I would recommended this recipe to everyone.

This is such a great recipe for soup! It tastes amazing! I changed only a couple things: I don't care for green chiles so I omitted them, and instead of chicken broth, I used vegetable soup mix(I couldn't find vegetable broth at the market I was at) and it still tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!

We love this chowder recipe but I have made a couple of adjustments to make it more 'corny' as one can of corn does not make a corn chowder for me.  I did not put the chilies or the cheese.  I did put 2 cans of cream style corn and one small bag of frozen corn when it was time to add the corn.  I have made huge batches of this for my husband's work functios and it is always gone almost immediately!  It's definitely a hit!

this is a keeper.  i made some adjustments to my taste though...  i added bacon.  instead of butter, i sauted the onions & gr peppers in the bacon grease.  also added 1 cup of water to it after i added the country gravy mix.  i also added garlic powder.

I just loved this recipe even my picky six year old had seconds. I only changed a few things. Didn't have any celery so skipped that portion, and we don't like things too spicy so we skipped the chiles, doubled the chicken broth and didn't have any processed cheese so just used 2 cups shredded cheddar. It was wonderful. Will make again.

Great soup, definetly restaurant quality!!  Didn't have celery so chopped up yellow bell pepper and cooked with onion.  Added 3/4 tsp of celery seed to broth.  I peeled too many potatoes before measuring so ended up using 5 cups of potatos.   Added extra can of chicken broth and extra 1/2 cup of milk and 1 can of cream of corn to compensate for extra potatos.  The country gravy sounds weird, but really thickens the soup and adds nice flavor, no need to substitue cream for milk.  The green chiles are a must, add a great flavor.  Enough to serve 8-10 large bowls.

This recipe was perfect for testing and then serving a group after we added salt and white pepper to taste and a teaspoon of finely chopped fresh basil and ground cardamom. We especially enjoyed it the third day after we heated up the leftovers. All of the flavors had become the best of friends! We served it in individual hollowed out sour doughbread bowls, impressive in every way!  Carol

This soup is super delicious! I did as others had suggested and subsituted half and half for the milk and then added bacon pieces with the cheese, other than those minor changes I left the recipe as-is. End result was fantastic and was even better the next day. I will definatly be making this soup again.

This was the BEST corn chowder I have ever tasted. I took a few suggestions from others feedback. I used 1 can each of cream corn and regular corn. I cut up a pack of bacon and a medium onion and fried it until it was all crispy and then set it aside until the potatoes were almost done. I left out the celery and the green chilies and instead of the Mexican processed cheese I used 1 cup of fiesta blend shredded cheese. I will defiantly make this over and over again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Delicious and easy to make! The jalapenos REALLY provide a kick, be prepared for that! I added freshly cooked spiral ham chunks and that really put it over the top. The gravy mix was exceptionally difficult to dissolve. Would definitely make again.

This was good - my family doesn't really care for potatoes, so I used 1/2 c rice in place of the potatoes and added a chopped carrot for extra nutrition/bulk and it was very good...in my opinon, the green chiles make it.

Quick and easy!  Needs a little more seasoning, some garlic, salt & pepper, but otherwise very good, nice change from the typical flour based chowder.

I was really leery of the gravy mix but the soup was delicious. I added one leek and an extra cup of milk just becuz I rarely follow an entire recipe. It turned out very tasty.

I have made this twice now and my 3 year loves it! She asks for it everyday! Love it....Oh, make sure to add some of your own flavors to it! Ours are salt, pepper, dried parsley, a tiny bit of dried basil and paprika. Have fun with it!

Great flavor. I'm not sure if it was the cheese I used, but I grated cheddar and added it to the simmering soup. The cheese didn't melt in smoothly, but rather in little lumps. Still tasty.

ABSOLUTELY DELISH!!!  My kids loved it.  I did add 1 1/2 cups extra broth as I found it a little too thick, but it still tasted the same!  Definately a winter favorite!  Give it a try

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I added a few extra spices. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chrused red pepper to taste. My family went on for days about this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

This was a very comforting meal.  I had to let it simmer for quite a while in order for the potatoes to soften and soak up some of the salt I had to add.  I didn't have celery but it didn't take away anything.  Also, I used regular shredded cheddar cheese.  Next time I would simmer the potatoes for much longer before adding the gravy and milk because it kept forming a skin on the top that I had to constantly stir away.  Will most likely make this again.

This is a great, easy recipe...so yummy!! I added fresh garlic and carrots. Instead of milk I used half and half with 2 cans of cream of corn and 1 can of whole corn. For a more hearty soup I added rotisserie chicken. My son LOVED it!! Will keep this recipe for sure. A dash for hot sauce was what we like for a little kick! ty for all the reviews they were very helpful..

This recipe tasted great, although it came out too thick so next time I will add more chicken stock and milk, and I only used half the can of green chilies and it was still spicy enough. thanks for posting it, will definitely make it again

So simple... so yummy. I didn't really make too many changes. Before I added the corn I 'smashed' up the potatoes just a little. I used creamed corn instead of whole kernel, and I skipped the chilies and used regular cheese. Was really good. Even my son who doesn't like corn ate it!!

This was a fantastic recipe, but I did make a few changes. As per other people's suggestions, I added a can of creamed corn and omitted the chiles. I did add a pinch of red pepper flakes, chili powder, garlic and Old Bay seasoning. The Old Bay is a MD thing and really added to the recipe! Thanks Jackay for the original recipe!

Very good recipe!  My only changes was adding a can of cream corn and a can of whole kernal corn and I used Velvetta rather than Mexican cheese and I topped with bacon.  I also served with Nann (bread).  Very tasty dinner!

SO good! Added finely diced red and yellow peppers to the veggies and substituted evaporated milk for half of the milk. Also used regular shredded Mexican blend cheese instead of Velveeta. Really yummy with a few good dashes of chipotle Tabasco!

This was by far the best potato corn chowder I've ever made. Everyone in my family loved it! Also, for you vegetarians, you can substitute the chicken broth with veggie broth and it doesn't affect the taste, that's what I did.

Very delicious.  My whole family loved it.  It's now one of our favorite soup recipes.  I've made it a half dozen times and curdled it twice by letting it get to a boil.  No worries...it didn't look great, but it was still just as delicious.

This was a great recipe!  It could have been a little thicker so next time I will drain the corn juice before adding. Recipe didn’t say if you should or not.  Add a little salt and fresh pepper and make some fresh biscuits and it was a hit with the family!

This chowder was yummy-tummy! I like things spice and this was splendidly spice,very nice flavor and a great mix of textures. I was sceptical about the gravy mix, but it was perfect. I thought Velvetta? What? I didn't even know they still made it, let alone in a Mexican variety. But boy did it turn out delicious! I followed the recipe down to the T, but I would like to try some of the variations. I did add bacon to my husbands and he loved it! Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

My family and I enjoyed it very much. I used 1% milk and it still came out rather creamy, yet with fewer calories than your standard cream-based soups. I didn't give it five stars because I think it needed an extra can of corn. Another bonus would be a little meat in it - I will add crumbled bacon next time. Overall a great recipe!

My husband absolutely adores this soup!  I made some changes... 1) I sauteed 3-4 strips of bacon in the pan before adding the onions and celery 2) instead of the can of chiles I added one seeded, finely diced jalapeno 3) we had some extra velveeta so I threw some of that in to kick up the cheese flavor 4) I added about 2 tbps cornstarch dissolved in water to get the thicker consistency my husband likes.  Served with some sliced french bread for dipping, he claims this is his new favorite home-cooked meal!  Thanks!

This was delicious! I made it following several of the suggestions- using half and half, adding carrots, using cream corn and frozen corn, and using Monterrey Jack and Mexican cheese instead of Velveeta. I also made it vegetarian by using vegetable stock and vegetarian gravy. The recipe made a huge pot- about 10 servings!

I love it!  I've made this several times, making it exactly as written except I salt to taste and use less cheese. Staple soup recipe, indeed.

Great chowder, but I have kicked it up a bit by adding Tyson Grilled Chicken Strips.  It then becomes a meal in a bowl.

Fantastic - I didn't have celery, so I substituted it for zuchini and celery seed.  Also added sliced ham that I browned first and it really enriched the flavor.

This is so easy to make and it tastes delicious. Its perfect for a chilly day! I add a bit of celery to the soup to give it a bit more color and add an extra can of corn because..well..I like corn. :P

Before trying this recipe, I've never made any type of chowder before. The only thing I added was a little more potatoes and I added some crispy bacon when serving. I've tried it with regular 2% milk and also 1/2 milk and 1/2 half & Half. Because I added extra potatoes, using just milk works well. The half & Half makes it too thick for me.

This is one of our favorite vegetarian soup recipes, serves with artisan bread from the local bakery and a fresh green salad.  Very flavorful, although my husband and I tend to add a little extra heat via tabasco sauce.  When I have it, I use my own frozen, home-roasted corn and when I don't, I use Trader Joe's roated corn.  Either way--yummy!

I was concerned about the country gravy mix making this soup too rich.  It turned out to be really good but I did add extra milk to thin it a bit.  I would probably add more veggies next time I make it as well.

Cheese and potatoes--there was little chance that I wouldn't like this recipe!  But, I found it to be just the right amount of thickness and just a good, solid winter soup.  The recipe as it stands makes a *lot* of soup, so I froze some and hope that it will still be good after that.

The on,y adjustments I made was to skip the gravy altogether and I used real cheese vs. processed. Perfect on a rainy day served with garlic ciabatta.

This turned out so great! I followed the others suggestions about frying out some bacon and using that as the oil. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written, but did add about 1/2 tsp of cajun spice to it towards the end. Gave it an extra little kick!

This chowder was sooooo good.  I made some substitutions since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I omitted the celery, onion, chiles, and processed cheese.  I added 2 cans cream of corn and 1 cup of Mexican-style shredded cheese.  This was the best chowder that I've ever cooked.

This was very good and is different from other potato soup recipes that I have tried.  I used frozen corn, which I put in with the potatoes (I'm not a big fan of canned corn).

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY I tripled this recipe for an office holiday party & it was the talk of day :) I did add a can of creamed corn and I could not find the 'mexican' Velveeta so I just used regular and made sure the green chiles I used were 'HOT' in order to give it the extra zip missing from the cheese. I also added a red and orange pepper for color :) MmmmmMmmmmMmmmm

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for in a hearty soup.  I made some adjustments as others have suggested by adding 1 can of creamed corn and 1 C of heavy whipping cream.  I added some ham to make this more of a meal.  Thanks for the great recipe!

YUMMY! What a great hearty recipe for a cold New England evening! 
I followed suggestions of others and added almost 4 cups of cubes potatoes (4 medium-sized potatoes), 1 can sweet kernel corn, drained and 1 can sweet cream of corn. I trimmed and cubed 1 boneless ham steak and crumbled 1/2 pound pre-cooked bacon.
I couldn't find a 2.5 ounce country gravy mix so I combined a 0.87 oz pkg of McCormick Chicken Gravy Mix and a 0.87 oz pkg of McCormick Brown Gravy Mix in a mix of 1 cup 2% milk and 1 cup heavy cream. The ham and bacon added just enough salt so I didn't add any additional. We all added pepper individually, especially since I omitted the chiles as I'm not a fan. Found it to be quite tasty without cheese as I initially forgot to add for everyone's first helping...the cheese added some more taste and thickened it more, too. 
Will make again! Enjoy!

Made this for dinner tonight and we all LOVED it!  I used chicken gravy mix since I didn't have the country gravy mix and I ended up adding about a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it a little more.  Used fat free milk, 12oz frozen corn and Light 2% Velveeta.  This is a keeper!  Oh by the way, if you are on Weight Watchers like me, this is only 3 points per cup (using the substitutions I made)!

I made this recipe for my sister's family with a few changes to suite their tastes and they loved it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked up some bacon, sauted the onions with a few garlic cloves, saving the crumbled up bacon to use as topping.  Left out the chiles and celery because my sister's family doesn't care for them and it was still wonderful.  It was even better the reheated the next day.

This is excellent!! I did make afew adjustments by some of the suggestions of other reviews. When sauteeing the onions I added 4 cloves of garlic chopped up. I added an extra can of corn and a can of cream corn. And 5c. of potatoes rather than 3c. I like my chowders hearty. And instead of 2c of milk. I did 1c of milk and 1c. of half & half. I just finished making it, and have a bowl in front of me. I love it!!!

This is a delicious recipe!  I used 5 cups of potatoes instead, just to make the soup thicker.  Also, I did not use the chiles - everything else was done exactly as stated in the recipe.  Also, I had no clue just how much this made.. serves AT LEAST 6 big bowls.

This was a very easy recipe and received great reviews from my family.  I did change a few things. I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of half and half instead of all milk.  I also added about half a can of cream style corn.  Can't wait to make it again!  Thanks.

This was so good.  The only thing I did different was add some minced garlic in with the celery and onion.  Then topped with crumbled bacon.  It was delicious.

This was very good, surprisingly, because it calls for plain milk, not cream or half and half. I will make this again! Perfect with cornbread!

This was SO yummy!!  I love cream soups so it's not hard to please me.  Whoever said it was bland must have bland tastebuds then, because this was perfect!  I didn't use the chiles because I don't like them, and I used a mexican blend shredded cheese and it was yummy.

Love this chowder on a cold or hot day! DIidn't use the chilis because we didn't have any, and it still tasted great. I think next time I'll add another can of corn though.

This was pretty good...it didn't quite have enough seasoning to me though. I added about 1/4 tsp creole seasoning and it was perfect.

This was delicious, however, I did have to make it twice.  I make a batch of soup once a month for my husband's 94 yr old uncle, and after making it according to the recipe, I decided it was too spicy for him. But, WE loved it!  So, on the 2nd batch, I omitted the diced chiles, used regular Velveeta instead of Mexican style, and added 1/8 tsp. black pepper.  It was perfect! Also, I did not drain the corn, since I think the liquid added a little flavor, and after sitting overnight, it was just the right consistancy.  (Every time I make soup, I let it sit overnight.  I just think it lets all the flavors blend together better.) Great recipe---thanks!

I was wary of some of the ingredients at first but I am so glad that I tried this recipe! I used frozen corn and regular Velveeta instead of Mexican-style, and it was so good! Creamy and hearty. My husband didn't even seem to notice that it didn't have meat in it. I've made it twice in 2 weeks and will make again. At some point I will try the Mexican-style velveeta.

This was incredible! I made this for my father, sister and husband, and they all loved it. I followed the recipe, except I skipped the Velveeta Mexi cheese. Instead, I added one can of Cambells Southwest Pepper Jack Cheese soup and added about 1/2 tsp chili powder. I then had shredded low fat Mexican cheese on the side so that everyone could mix their own cheese into the soup. Very good! Not too spicey but just enough to give it an after bite. I definitely recommend the Pepper Jack cheese soup.

This is excellent, except for the fact that it has some ingredients that I would prefer not to use i.e. the gravy mix.  I wish I could make this same great tasting soup with healthier ingredients.

I followed the recipe except for two things  I added an extra can of corn to make it bulkier, and I didn't have processed cheese so I used shredded.  The chowder was good!  My 3 and 5 year old liked it as well.  Next time I will add bacon for more flavor, as others suggested.

This is a great easy recipe.  Very kid-friendly.  I didn't really change a thing, except to cut the amount of the chile peppers in half.  It was still a bit spicy for my 3-year-old.

Really good soup - I prefer potato soup a little thicker, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. For a little more flavor, I added garlic when I sauteed the onion/celery, and carrots with the corn for more veggies. Next time, I will add less milk or broth, and probably simmer a good hour so it soaks up the flavor.

This is great corn chowder. I added 2 cans creamed corn and topped with green onions.  Loved the taste from the mild chiles. Tastes even better after sitting for a day. I would definately make this again.

We followed the directions with an addition of cut up bacon, in place of the butter and put in about 1/2 cup of ham.  Absolutely great tasting and easy.  A very fast meal to prepare and we had nearly everything on hand!  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and although it tasted fine it definetly wasn't five star worthy. We had family over and there were seven people that had a bowl and not one was like, oh my gosh!  My mother has a recipe much easier and tastes better.

I used 1 can of corn and 1 can of creamed corn.  I first cooked about 5 slices of bacon in my pot and used the grease to cook the onions.  I did not use celery or chile's.  I also did not use the gravy since I didn't have any on hand.  This soup was soooo easy to make, I will DEFINITELY make again and again!! Next time I will make with everything it calls for, but seriously, this was by far one of the tastiest soups I've ever had!! **This soup is VERY filling.  I made the entire batch for my boyfriend and I, and there is soooo much left over!! :)

The gravy mix makes this chowder extra special, the flavor is wonderful.  I did leave out the chiles(didn't have any) and use cheddar cheese(personal preferance).  This is perfect for a chilly winter day.

One of my new favorite soups!  I made this for soup/sandwich night at work and it was a huge hit.  There was none left to bring home and I doubled the recipe.  I added a little more salt and had to sub regular shredded Velveeta (couldn't find the Mexican?), but it came out great.  I used skim milk to lighten it up a bit and can't wait to make it again.

I made this last night for dinner and it was fantastic.  I made only a couple of slight changes.  I used yukon gold potatoes with the skin on and I used butter instead of margarine. It was awesome.

Yum, yum, yum!  We loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes to it, by adding about 4 grilled chicken breasts, chopped up. I did a bag of frozen corn because I think it has more flavor and a can of creamed corn for a little thicker consistency.  I used shredded Mexican blend cheddar cheese and left out the chiles because my one year old wouldn't have done well with them.  We also added a side of veggies to lighten it up, for those concerned about too many calories.  This was simple and we have a lot of leftovers.

Good stuff! I used butter and freshly grated cheese and didn't use the gravy mix - instead I used cornstarch... and added some spices... thx for the recipe!

I have a bad cold and also burned my tongue while tasting this, so I couldn't really tell how great it was.  My family however, RAVED about this.  Even though this has received a very high rating, I wasn't expecting much, because it didn't include any spices or seasonings, but apparently, this is one of the best recipes I have ever made according to my family.

WOW. this is really great soup. filling, thick, and satisfying. 

i couldn't find the 2.5 ounce package of country style gravy mix, so i just used 2 smaller brown gravy mixes instead. 

i added carrots and omitted chilles.

i used about 1/2 of the brick of velveeta, and added about 3 ounces of shredded sharp cheddar.

try it, you'll like it!

Great soup! I followed the recipe and added shredded carrots and it was wonderful.  I used skim milk so it wasn't real creamy, but didn't lose any flavor.  The sourdough breadbowls I got from the bakery made it that much better.

OMG, this is absolutely divine.  I've made this multiple times, and everybody loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect.  Sometimes if I don't have the Mexican blend cheese, I just add cheddar cheese, and that works out fine.  I think I'll try bacon and clams next time.  mmmm.....so good.

I admit I would not have tried this recipe had I not read the reviews.  Velveeta and gravy mix???  Are you kidding?  But WOW, was I amazed.  This is really good chowder!  I left out the chilis, added a can of cream style corn, and used regular velveeta (an 8 oz block), then added quite a bit of salt and pepper.  I also took a posters suggestion and added a few shakes of hot sauce after the cheese for a little kick.  I cooked the potatoes a little less (about 20 minutes) so they wouldn't be mushy.  Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I'll add some bacon.  I just can't believe how tasty and thick it came out.  It made a huge pot of soup and I am a single person, so I took it to work in a crock pot to see if anyone would eat some of it.  I'm lucky I came home with any at all!  Most people will tell you something you made is good, even if they're just being polite, but when they go back for 2nd and 3rd bowls, you know you've got a winner.  I will definitely be adding this to my recipe file.

Pretty good... not my favorite because it tastes so heavy.  Judging from the processed cheese and the gravy mix it is probably not the healthiest option even for a chowder.  Although it is a good recipe it doesnt suit my personal tastes.

I have made this twice and it is so yummy!  Both times I took others suggestions - used a can of regular corn and a can of cream-style.  I also skipped the Velveeta and used about a cup of cheddar/jack shredded cheese.  I also fried up some bacon and crumbled it on top when I served it.  Perfect for a cold winter day.

OMG OMG OMG!! I was a little hesitate at first to make this soup due to the processed cheese, even tho im a big velveeta fan! But I made it and it was sooo delish!! I didnt add the green chilies and I used the regular velveeta opposed to the one in the recipe. And I added a can of creamed corn and served it with chopped bacon on top and served in sourdough bread bowls. This is my new favorite!! I think i'm gunna make it again tonight. Yum Yum Yum!!

This was pretty good.  I wasn't nearly as impressed as I thought I would be but I think I may make this again.  It definately needs more corn.  I followed the recipe and with all of the other stuff in it, I barely even saw the corn.

I made this tonight and it was FANTASTIC!! I loved the flavors. I pretty much followed the recipe with these exceptions: I fried bacon, then crumbled it and added it with the cheese. I sauteed the potatoes in the bacon drippings for about 5 minutes before adding the potatoes to the boiling cx broth. (I left out the celery and onion to satisfy picky eater) I used around 4 1/2 cups of potatoes and only boiled them for about 16-18 minutes as mushy potatoes aren't my favorite. I added 1 can corn and 1 can cream corn with the chiles and used 1 c. cream and 1c. milk mixed with the country gravy and 1/2 block reg. velveeta cheese diced up as I have a 2 year old and didn't want it too spicy, absolutey wonderful, Thanks so much for recipe!! I will be making it again and taking it to work for the ladies in my office to try!! Thanks Again:)

This recipe is very good!  My entire family (even my picky 7 year old) enjoyed it.  I did modify a little.  I double the recipe and didn't inlcude the chili's.  It was spicy enough without.  I did add a good bit of salt to the recipe, of course that's just personal preference.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Who'd a thunk gravy mix in a soup?!  But it's awesome.  Made it ahead and took it on an overnight boat trip and everyone --kids and adults -- LOVED it!  A keeper!

This soup was very good.  I doubled it, because I have teenagers and wanted leftovers for another night.  Followed the recipe exactly, but I think next time might add more cheese.  Yum!   Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was tasty soup.  I used half regular Velveta cheese and half pepper jack. Still, it was a little too spicy for my 2 and 4 year olds, but my DH and I loved it. It made a lot of soup!  We ate it for three days.  Good stuff.

I made this soup yesterday for a Pampered Chef show I hosted...everyone LOVED it and asked for the recipe. The consultant even had seconds and said she was making it this week for her family!
I rinsed the corn as someone else suggested and added 1 extra cup of potatoes...I will be making again and again, as the small bowl I saved for my hubby (a Chef) got me my favorite review "outstanding"! Thanks for sharing :)

This was very good. I used red potatoes with the skins on and left the chilies out. This has a permanent place in my recipes book.

I really liked this soup! I used creamy style corn to try and hide the corn from my husband that does not like corn. Didn't work, but the rest of use loved this.

Awesome!  It is just the right amount of consistency and cheesiness. I added another can of corn and used regular Velveeta.  The chilis gave it enough kick for me.  My picky husband loved this.  And I loved how easy it was to make.  I will make this again and again.

This was one of those "Wow" recipes for my family. Everyone really enjoyed it. I like recipes that taste like they took a lot more work than they actually do, and this was definitely one of those :) I had frozen fresh corn from this summer so that went into it and I used 2T. butter instead of margarine. Other than that no changes. My son and I thought it was just the right amount of spiciness, but my husband added red pepper flakes to his. I know I will make this recipe over and over. Thanks so much for sharing it!

I love this recipe but I also made some changes to it. I added diced red pepper and I opted to add a half heavy cream half milk.I also added a can of cream corn.

this was excellent, even though i had no potatoes handy, i just used a bit more corn. the only thing was the pepper-y taste, which was a bit much for my tastes.

Amazing!!! You almost feel guilty eating this soup b/c it is sooo good.  We have been eating it over the past few days and have enjoyed every bite.  It is great served with some biscuits (I served it with the biscuit sitting in the soup).

This was very very good! Mine didn't look like the photo though because of the chicken stock I used. It was a packet and it had orange coloring, so the soup LOOKED like it had a bunch of cheese in it, but it didn't!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I just made this and it is the best. I did as others had suggested and changed the following: I used 1 can cream of corn, and 2 cans regular corn, I used low fat half and half in place of the milk and for cheese I used 1/2 mexican shredded blend and 1/2 montery jack . This recipe will be used over and over at our house. What a great easy chowder!! Thanks again for posting!

I haven't even taken this off the stove to serve yet and just tasting it to see if it needed any seasonings, sent my tummy into orbit.  I made as listed with the exception of omitting celery since we don't like it.  It is thick, delicious, and rich. I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Very Good!  I did not have gravy packets so instead I added 3 tablespoons of corn starch and just a few pinches of beef bouillon gradules to the milk before mixing into the soup mix.  Very Very good.

Loved this recipe....tweeked it a bit..didn't have any chiles or gravy mix, so instead used ground red pepper and a ton of black pepper(like two palm fulls), for added kick!  I used ff half & half and added half a bag of sharp cheddar cheese and the rest of a container of asiago cheese...fabulous base recipe!!!!

This soup was good, used hot gr. chilies instead of mild, still needed a little kick, also used fat free half and half, and was plenty thick.

Very tasty soup!  Even the kids ate it, which is quite the miracle.  Great on cold, wintery day!

This was a very good recipe. I did make a couple changes though. I left out the gravy mix and used 1 cup milk and 1 cup of whipping cream. It came out fabulously.

I made this last weekend for my husband and I...IT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!  I used some of the suggestions that I saw here (cream corn, half and half etc) I also added a few drops of Tabasco for a little heat.  I also think next time I may use fresh chilies instead of canned.  Had PLENTY of leftovers and everyone at work the next day said my leftovers smelled heavenly!!!

LOVED it! But since I'm sensitive to MSG, and couldn't find a country style gravy mix without it, I cooked bacon in the soup pot, drained most of the fat, sauteed the veggies in the fat (instead of margerine), then used regular gravy mix. I also added carrots to the potatoes and crumbled the bacon on top! WONDERFUL!

This chowder was excellent. I made it a s a clam chowder by adding 3 cans chopped clams, 1 cup chopped carrots and 2 bottles clam juice. I substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for milk and added the can of creamed corn. I would cook the potatoes less next time as they were a little over done.

This soup was pretty good, though I thought that it would be a little thicker.  The whole pot was gone in one meal, though, so that's always a good sign!

This soup was so GOOODDDD! I modified it a little for the sake of time but it had all the ingredients as the basic. Instead of using fresh ingredients I got 2 bags of steam fresh southwestern corn. It was just as awesome.  Great recipe.

Everyone in the family LOVED this recipe.  Even my 8 and 12 year old who usually despise anything with green peppers or chilies want me to make it again soon.  I added the extra can of creamed corn and it gave the dish a great texture.  Salad and corn bread rounded out our meal beautifully.  Definite keeper.

This recipe is great.  You can change it to your liking. I switched out the celery for carrots. I added garlic, bacon, and cooked chicken. One bowl will fill you up, but you can't eat just one bowl!

Great recipe and very easy to make.  I added a can of cream style corn as well as regular corn, as others suggested.  I think next time I may even add more.  I also used shredded cheddar cheese since I don't usually have velveeta on hand.  Very filling, very good for winter nights.  It's a keeper.

We definitely enjoyed this, but will add more spice to give it a kick next time.  I used regular Velveeta, which was probably the reason for lack of spice.  Per suggestions from other reviews, I added a can of creamed corn.

This was a very easy and quick recipe to prepare. I used sharp cheddar chesse instead of the velvetta, and added a couple tablespoons of sour cream.  It was very tasty and the whole family loved it!  Great for a cold winter night when you want some hot soup but don't want to spend all day cooking.

Very yummy, but a little bit spicy for my taste. I made it exactly as directed the first time and the second time I omitted the green chilies. Would also be good with regular velveeta. Leftovers tasted great with petite peas stirred on (frozen, not canned).

I'm not a real big chowder person...but I really wanted something different.  I thought this was pretty good for chowder, my husband thought it was great.  I did dice up some cooked chicken and toss it in for some protein.

Very good comfort food!  I made a few alterations (of course): cut back on the onions and celery, added shredded carrots, cream corn, diced ham, bacon bits, canned diced potatos, and one baked chicken breast cut into very small pieces (just for added flavor).  Used 1/2 cup velveta and 1 cup shredded cheddar (it melted great).  This is a wonderfully soul-warming soup.  Easy to alter to your taste or to whatever you happen to have in the fridge.

YUMMY!  This is even better the next day after it has been in the refrigerator and the flavors combine.  I added some turkey sausage and it turned out great.  I will definitly make this again.

This was so good. The first time I made it I thought that the corn was a little over powering. The second time I just added about 3/4 a can of corn and it was perfect. Thanks!

This was very good. I was a little a little worried about how this would taste when I put the gravy in there, but it turned out very, very yummy. I didnt have any chilies so I used a jalapeno. I will make this again for sure! Thank you.

Very good! I had to omit the green chilis as I didn't have any, and I used regular processed cheese which I'm not usually very keen on, but which worked well in this recipe. This is great for when you're low on groceries (like I am today), as you'll most likely have everything on hand. Thanks!

We thought this recipe was just "pretty good".  It is definitely a chowder (more so than what I think of as potato soup, which is what I was intending to make for dinner), probably due to the addition of the gravy mix.  As far as chowders go, though, it was definitely pretty good -- glad we made it, may make it again, tasted good, etc. -- but it didn't knock our socks off.  I wasn't so sure about the gravy mix, but it gives it a nice creaminess with a hearty flavor.  This recipe is fine how it is, but I imagine it would be an excellent base for just about any sort of chowder you may want to make, and it's nice because you can keep most of the ingredients on hand for a quick meal any time.

I have made this chowder for friends and family, and everyone loves it!!! I never get away from one of these activities without refering people to this website and recipe because every one wants it.  It is just that good.  I sometimes will leave out the diced green chili's and use a tablespoon of real bacon bits and it adds a great flavor also.  Thanks Jackay!!

This stuff is great!  Was a big hit at our house.  I used about half the bacon grease in with the bacon and it just gives it such a great flavor.  I've made this tons of times and every time I make it different but this is defnitely one of those great crockpot winter comfort foods, especially if served in a toasted sourdough bread bowl.

Great recipie! Has a Santa Fe kind of flavor. You can really taste the green chilies. It was so easy to make, and it made a ton. I am freezing some for later. It would be delicious in a bread bowl. We served with tortilla chips and it was great. Even my husband enjoyed it. My 13 month old wasn't a big fan, but, I think that is because of the chilies. It is a little spicy, but, not hot. Will definately make this again.

I have made this many times, and it is always excellent.  I hide the Velveeta and gravy mix from guests, and no one would guess that it contains these ingredients.  I highly recommend this recipe exactly as-is!

We served this at our housewarming party, we ran out. We offered my husbands famous clam chowder and this new recipe and made twice as much of the clam chowder, needless to say we should have made more of the corn chowder. We served it in sour-dough bread bowls. Yummy! The gravy mix may throw you off but you will love this recipe.

This recipe was amazing.  My boyfriend loved it, and he normally isn't a fan of chowder.  I took some suggestions and used olive oil instead of margarine, and a small can of creamed corn as well.  It was great!  I will definately make this one again.

Good.  Needed a good deal of salt (but I did use reduced-sodium chicken broth).  Just spicy enough.  I used red potatoes and a shredded Mexican cheese blend.  Topped with extra cheese.

I loved this chowder! It was creamy and delicious- a real comfort food. I sauteed the onion in olive oil rather than margerine, left out the celery (personal taste), used 4 cups of cubed baby red potatoes, added an extra can of (cream-styled) corn, added a bit of corn starch to the milk to make it extra thick, and used shredded Mexican cheese blend rather than " processed cheese food." It was gone in no time.

Oh my! This was soooooo yummy! Warmed us right on up! I didn't change a thing other than leaving the celery out (due to our tastes) and it was FANTASTIC! Very filling and enjoyable! Many thanks to you, Jackay, for giving me a new recipe to add to my family's recipe box! :o)

This chowder is wonderful.  I omited the chilies and addes two small cans of mushrooms to the onion and celery sautee.  The gravy mix is a great way to thicken this soup and the Mexican Velvetta not only gave it an extra kick, but it also helped thicken it.  Good and rich.  Yum!

Great recipe. I added more potatoes as previously suggested, and used regular velveeta rather than the mexican kind with a few handfuls of colby-jack. I omitted the chilies and used fresh mushrooms instead. Family loved it!

This soup is great!  I added extra potatoes, a small jar of sliced pimentoes, and 2 cups of diced, roasted chicken.  The country gravy mix adds a wonderful flavor.

This recipe was awesome.  I substituted frozen corn instead of canned and shredded real Mexican cheese for the processed cheese.

A nice recipe.  Next time I think I will try it with bacon instead of the chilis.  I found the flavor of the canned chilis took over the chowder.  I used plain Velveeta. I've never cooked with "processed cheese food" but was pleasantly surprised with how nice it melted.  It's a keeper.  Thanks.

My husband loves this soup!  Our 17 year old daughter doesn't care for spicy foods, so I used regular velveeta and used less chilies.  I am going to try adding chicken and bacon for a change.

Everyone in my family loved this chowder. My 3 yr old has dubbed this as her favorite "powder" and requests it on a regular basis.  What a wonderful and easy chowder recipe to prepare.  For kids it goes great served with Jello!!!
