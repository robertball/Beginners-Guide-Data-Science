This is a refreshing change to stir-fry. I ommitted the chiles and lemon peel (none available) but did sprinkle a little lemon pepper seasoning over the chicken while browning as well as some minced garlic.  The lemon is noticeable but not overpowering and we all enjoyed this easy to make dinner!

The basic recipe is OK.  I made rice my own way, but followed the chicken part.  I doubled the sauce recipe (2C broth 2T cornstarch).  After I added the broth and it thickened, it smelled like chicken w/ gravy.  I tasted it and it was v. bland.  I grated an additional lemon rind into the pot, then added some soy sauce (a few healthy shakes).  After that, it was very good and worthy of 5 stars.

Substitued red bell peppers for the pea pods, but otherwise stayed with the recipe.  Excellent!  I am a big fan... it is now a regular recipe for us!
