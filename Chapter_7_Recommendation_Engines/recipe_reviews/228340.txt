I have been trying to incorporate more dark, leafy greens into my diet but have been fighting with kale's toughness and bitterness.  I had no idea that a two minute salt massage could make such a HUGE difference.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, Leslie for this fabulous recipe and especially for the priceless tip tucked inside!

Pretty delicious!  I wasn't sure what "massaging" meant- so I just put a bunch in a large bowl and started kneading it lightly with my fingers.  After about a minute it started to wilt and release a bit of its liquid.  At 2 minutes it had decreased in volume by almost half and was looking tasty.

I substituted walnuts for pine nuts and cranberries for currants based on what I had in my fridge.  I also added a tablespoon of olive oil.  Very versatile.

Thank you! I've always hated kale - too coarse-textured- but have eaten it because it's good for me. That massaging does the trick and the combination is very good.

This is delicious.  Thanks for sharing the tip about massaging the kale.  I have disliked eating kale for years because of its taste.  I will like eating every week for years to come now.  I could not find currants where I live, so I used strawberries.  I am not sure about the difference in taste, as I have never had currants, but it is quite good.  I also substituted walnuts for pine nuts.

I can see buying a lot more kale in my future! This was delicious! This was my first time preparing a raw kale dish. I use kale quite often in my raw juices, and I've had kale salad in restaurants, but I've always been a little hesitant to make it at home.  Like everyone else has mentioned, the massaging makes a world of difference. DO NOT skip this step. This salad had a perfect balance of flavorsâ€¦.salty, nutty, sweet, and it's incredibly healthy.  This would definitely impress dinner guests. A keeper for sure. Thanks for the great recipe, Leslie!

We're growing so much kale this year we are trying 2 new recipes a week. This is our favorite. So easy and refreshing and healthy! You won't even miss the lack of dressing, as the salt massage and apple cider vinegar give it just enough flavor. Didn't have currants or pine nuts so substituted dried cranberries and chopped almonds instead. Still delicious! Still great on day 2...cider kept the apples from turning brown.

loved to learn about massaging Kale, this was a bit salty, but I have since learned salt is not needed when massaging. A great recipe though.

This is a good way to incorporate kale into anyone's diet.  "Massaging" the kale was new to me, but I like to try new things.  Another word would be kneading, like bread dough but using a softer touch.  I added apples, craisins, and feta cheese.  Wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.

Love this recipe - a great way to eat kale.  I add strawberries and/or watermelon instead of currants and use a little bit of sweet vidalia vinaigrette.

Makes raw kale enjoyable. Yup, the kale massaging made the greens a bit more tender and flavorful. I added a quarter cup of thinly sliced purple cabbage and the same of grated carrots. The rest I kept the same.

Excellent salad; I could not believe how tender the kale became after "massaging" it. The dish was sweeter than saltier, despite the salt. I used raisins because I didn't have currants . . . but I'd definitely go with currants next time. Truly delicious.

I have to agree with some of the other posts!  I would never have thought that kale served this way would be edible.  I too have found it stiff and difficult to deal with.  It really is the massaging that does it and I never would have believed it.  I used cashews and some other nuts I had and it still came out looking and tasting great.  Considering how healthful kale is and how good this recipe is, I'll be making this many times in the future.

Love this one. If pine nuts are out of your price range add chopped walnuts. Adds a nutty Flavor. I found leaving n fridge overnight made the flavors blend even better

Best salad I've ever put together! Had no idea kale could taste this good. Substituted the feta for Gorgonzola cheese. Absolutely delicious and refreshing!

Wonderful recipe. This recipe always reminds me that simple recipes that are well balanced are almost always better than the complicated ones. I used a little less salt than called for. I hadn't heard of "massaging" kale before and that has become my all-time favorite kale technique. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was alright. Thanks for the tip of massaging salt on the kale to make it less course. I will be enjoying more kale in my salads this way.

great and simple recipe.  I discovered organic baby kale pre-washed at my local grocery and snapped it up.  No need to massage as these tiny leaves are super tender and flavorful.  I added a bit of salt anyway for flavor and think it is improved by a bit of oil.  I didn't care for it when it wilted with the salt but I think that was because I used the baby leaves.  Would certainly try the massage method w/"adult" kale!

Not a fan of apple cider vinegar. I knew that going into this. But this salad is so healthy and got good reviews so I thought I  would try it. Sorry to be so graphic but it tastes like puke, literally.

The kale is still, well, kale.  The "massage" does change the texture somewhat but I didn't feel it addressed the bitterness enough to make this enjoyable.  I really enjoyed the other ingredients and plan to use them on different greens in the future.  I used dried cranberries instead of currants but otherwise followed the recipe precisely.

I can't believe what a difference the kale massage makes! Fantastic! The fam said that I could have used less vinegar. I subbed dried cranberries and walnuts. Kale is cheap here so I'm sure we will be eating this all summer.

I don't know if their is a difference, but I use purple kale. Many of the reviews state that kale is difficult to deal with it it's raw state. I have not found this with purple kale.

This salad was delicious. I never knew that massaging the kale with salt makes it so much softer and more edible! I didnâ€™t have pine nuts or currants, so I used pecans and craisins.  I also dressed the salad with a lemon and olive oil dressing, similar to a kale salad that I had eaten in a restaurant in Hawaii.....and it was to die for!  Thank you, Leslie,for sharing this recipe!

Had to rate a 3 as is, but with some changes it is a 4 or maybe even a 5.  We changed the currants & pine nuts to cranberries & walnuts.  After trying with that change twice we decided just adding more apple cider vinegar wasn't cutting it with us.  We switched for a third shot at this recipe and now use raspberry vinaigrette & it is terrific.  Will make again with our changes.  We have lots of kale in the garden & now we can make something other than kale chips.

This was pretty good, I was skeptical but massaging the kale did break it down. I was making a salad for one so I didn't measure anything, just sprinkled on whatever seemed right, and I had to substitute dried cranberries for currants. But it was a nice, different lunch.

Great and versatile recipe. I prefer apples to the pears and cranberries to the currants... but it's just a personal preference. I often use toasted almond slivers but walnuts are great too. Massaging the kale makes ALL the difference. My recipe recommended kneading the cut up kale for 2 minutes and allowing it to drain (if you have a spinner, that works great). Also I'm a big fan of gorgonzola/blu cheese so I put bunches of it on the salad instead of the feta... It's my go-to company salad.

Loved this ... Substitution only because I used what I had on hand. Substituted  chopped walnuts for pine nuts and raisins for currants. Delicious !!!

I just made this and I used craisins and walnuts. I was surprised how good it was! With only 1 tbsp of cider vinegar for a dressing I thought it might be bland but not the case at all.Definitely don't skip massaging the lettuce, I've never heard of such a thing but it makes a difference. I learned some new things and found a salad I will make more often as I have started really liking kale and use it often.

I learned that you can massage kale with anything - not just salt, which for me made this too salty.  Skip the salt.  Delicious!  The dark green color makes for a beautiful presentation.  Also good with pear instead of apple, and a little balsamic vinegarette. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

OMG this was OUTSTANDING!!!!  I had never tasted Kale before, but was always curious to try it....this was delicious!  Only change was to sub cranberries for the currants, and my apple was rather large, so that added a pleasant sweetness. I ate almost the whole bowl by myself!  I saved some for lunch tomorrow, so I will give an update on how the Kale held up with the minor amount of vinegar...I am looking forward to having this again tomorrow. Please try this delicious, nutritious salad...it is WONDERFUL!!!!

Very nice, balanced. Great way to eat raw kale, a hearty salad and so quick to make. I wanted to try saving some until tomorrow to see how well it held up - but I ended up finishing it all! Thank you for the recipe

This is a great recipe. I used craisins and toasted my pine nuts for a few minutes in a skillet. Try this with the "Dinosaur" kale. That is the kale that is dark green, bumpy leaf texture, and very nutritious. Also, this recipe does not need near as much salt as is called for. Just a pinch of sea salt will do fine. And you don't need the salt to make the massage technique work. It's great. I'm the only one in my family who will eat kale though. No problem, its just more for me!!

I made this salad 4 times in 2 weeks! I changed it a little. I tried Honey ginger balsamic and blood orange oil. I added candied ginger bits. When I ran out of Homey/ginger balsamic, I made my own with plain balsamic, honey, and powdered ginger. Also made it with almond balsamic. We love this salad!

I love this salad.  I love how the sweetness compliments the salt. I made a couple of minor changes because I didn't have all the asked for ingredients. I used dried cranberries for the the currents and toasted sliver almonds for the pine nuts. The only thing I would be careful about is the amount of salt used. It can get a bit salty if you don't use the right amount of kale, however the sweetness from the cranberries balanced out the flavours. I will definitely be making this again.

Perfect Kale Salad! It was my first, so learning about the massaging part made it come out great, first try! And I used Craisins in place of the currants, because I didn't have any.

I skipped the salt but I'd rate this 5 stars for the kale massaging idea alone! Like other reviewers, I used what I had on hand and am happy to report that chopped walnuts and dried cherries are terrific with the kale and feta. I also added some blood-orange olive oil (a favorite of mine) and have made this salad three times in the past week. Even my kale-resistant other-half didn't complain :-)

This is the first time I've tried kale. I was searching for a nice salad to pair with cioppino we will be serving at our neighborhood "Progressive Dinner Party".  Five couples. Drinks at one house, appetizers at the next, and at our house soup and salad, before we go to the next house for an entree, and last house serves dessert.  We're all excited to try new things.   So, I kept hearing about this kale salad paired with seafood soup to be a good one.  I made this recipe with what I had in my pantry to try it out.  I used sliced almonds, and  dried cranberries, no apple and no apple cider vinegar.  It is tasty, and very different for me. With all the tomato-y broth in the cioppino, I think this salad will be perfect with it.  I will use pine nuts, and also add bread crumbs or croutons too, or serve with a crunchy piece of garlic bread.

I was looking for a kale salad that didnâ€™t use gobs of olive oil and was so pleased to find this. I made this for a large family dinner and everyone asked for the recipe it was so good!! I used fat free feta also. They had no idea it was essentially a fat free salad. I also love that it can be made well in advance so could take for lunch all week.

I am excited to have learned about massaging kale to make it less bitter and much more a salad star rather than supporting ingredient. Due to what I had available, I used Pepitas, fresh grated Parmesan and some fine blue cheese crumbles on the salad. I also drizzled a little GOOD, thick balsamic vinegar over the top of the salad. I look forward to making this again and playing with the variations.

We've been making this for our Meals on Wheels clients and it's getting good reviews. We've found that using baby kale makes the massaging easier and the salad more tender. We've also replaced the vinegar with orange juice, which still tenderizes the salad but makes it less acidic and sweetens it a bit; also we use about 2/3 of the oil.  We love it with craisins!

This salad was just OK, and way too salty if you follow the recipe as written.

Absolutely Delicious! I only changed two ingredients, and only because I did not have them on hand... I used dates instead of Currants and Walnuts instead of Pine nuts. Both clean & loaded with fiber and healthy fat.

This was very tasty. I also added pan-seared chicken to make it an entrÃ© sized salad.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for - quick, easy, and delicious! I used half garlic salt and half pink salt, since I love a hint of garlic in most everything I cook. I used a Fuji apple, sautÃ©ed my pine nuts in lemon EVOO, and man, it feels like a healthy yet filling lunch. Definitely making this again :)

I'm not a fan of Kale and have tried many other types of recipes for my family.  However this was very good and the a nice change from the same old regular garden salad I usually make. Will try shaved Parmesan cheese next time.

So easy and so delicious! I can't believe what a simple and effective step massaging the kale is. I used dino kale and followed the recipe exactly, though it's a great base for modifications. The leftovers held up really well, too.

Love the Kale tip. Used a little less salt when massaging...followed the rest. Used a macintosh(my favorite) and it was amazing. Love,love,love it. Reminded me a little of broccoli salad, but healthier and more amazing!!!! Next time I am doubling it.

I served this last night with a group of women and it went fast! Everyone loved the flavors. After learning how to massage kale I will be serving fresh kale much more often.  Really brings out flavor and softens overly chewy texture of this wonder-veggie. Great recipe!

I made a half batch, as my husband doesn't really care for raw kale. I had to sub dried cranberries for currants, but otherwise, I made it as written. It's so fresh and delicious! I love how quick and easy this was to make; this will go into my summer salad rotation. Thanks!

My husband and I really enjoyed this salad.  I used half the apple and didn't have pine nuts so I tossed in some walnuts.  I will definitely be making this again.

I really  liked this salad and have made it several times this month. I am giving it a high rating because adding apples and feta makes this salad. My husband wanted more of a dressing, so here is what I came up with everyone seemed to love at Easter:
I filled a bowl with kale and massaged 1/2 teaspoon of salt as directed. For the dressing I combined 3 pkgs of stevia, 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup of white balsamic vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper,  1/4 extra virgin olive oil. 
I replaced currents for cranraisins and the pine nuts for toasted walnuts. Excellent with these changes, but as written it is still a great salad.

Very good- I've finally found a way to eat kale that doesn't involve blanching or steaming or cooking at all!  I made it exactly as described except substituted slivered almond for pine nuts (pine nuts are expensive yo!)  It was good but a bit salty; I don't think this is the fault of the recipe but rather that my "bunch" of kale was probably smaller than what was intended.  I then squeezed the juice out of half a lime I had lying around which took a bit away from the saltiness.  I will definitely make again, being cautious with the salt.  I recommend trying it with the lime juice and also would use a more sour apple, like granny smith, for best results.

The salt massage does help to break down the kale into something more palatable, but I found that it also made the salad quite salty, particularly when combined with feta cheese.  Overall I thought the salad could also use perhaps a bit more sweetness, too, so I might try balsamic vinegar in place of apple cider vinegar.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! It's so simple, but the flavors work really well together. I substituted roasted almond slivers for pine nuts (because I'm a poor college student) and it was delicious. Enjoy!

It is a wonderful way to actually ENJOY kale. This salad was so good, that it made my teenagers smile. .....and it tasted even better the next day. I thought it could do with a bit more sweetness to offset the vinegar, so I added 1/4 cup of orange juice to the dressing - Delicious!! Next time I'll try it with some honey. Thank you for posting.

I had high hopes for this salad but was disappointed. Too saltly. Plus the 'dressing' of cider vinegar just didn't do it for me. The rub was great and will use again.

Really enjoyed this!  Great to learn about massaging kale!  I just used the vinegar to do it though because I was afraid it would be too salty otherwise.  Loved the flavors in this, and it's so healthy too. Didn't have currants so left them out and used raw sunflower seeds for the pine nuts. Thanks for sharing, I'll be making this often!

The salad tasted really good and the massaging made a huge difference! I added salt, crushed peanuts and feta cheese but just three were enough to bring out the flavours in kale!

I made this for my son-in-law's birthday dinner and everyone else liked it but he didn't like the feta. Thanks for the idea of massaging the kale that really tenderized it. I have another kale salad that I like better. The dressing is heated and when poured over the salad it wilts the salad a little. But next time I make it I'll massage the kale like this recipe instructs. Thanks Leslie

Very good recipe! Great way to get more kale in my diet.  I didn't have pine nuts so I used pecans; also used craisins instead of currant.  I added diced red onion to the salad.  Thanks for sharing!

First time I made it, I couldn't imagine using such a small amount of vinegar - and I added it to entire salad (minus toasted almonds). When I tasted it, vinegar was overpowering; to compensate I added some Truvia and WOW, so good.

Like others, hubby and I thought we didn't much like kale, but we LOVED this salad!  Had leftovers 2 days later, adding some more toasted almonds to refresh "toasted" nut taste- still good!  Yesterday,I realized in morning I was to take a potluck dish to bridge, made it from remaining ingredients in refrig and it was GONE once it hit the table.  Thank you!

I loved the light sweetness of this salad combined with the crunch of nuts. I substituted with pear instead of apple, dried plums instead of currants, rice vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar, and mixed nuts instead of pine nuts, and parmesan cheese instead of feta. That seems like a totally different recipe. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the recipe was the inspiration but you can go so many different ways depending on what you have on hand.

It was ok.  You have to cook a lot of it up to make 2 servings though.

I prepared a Kale Salad last night for our dinner.  I used Baby Kale, Cold Cooked Black Eyed Peas,(For good luck in 2015) Red onion, some Romaine Lettuce to lighten the flavor, Pine Nuts and a Good Balsamic dressing.  It was enjoyed by all.  We use to get a fantastic Kale Soup in PTown, Mass made with navy beans, kale, sausage and onion.  I am sure there are recipes out there for anyone interested.  A good way to use your left over Kale, Kale is very good for you.

Made it for a Christmas pot luck and it was a hit.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  It was so simple I could give it to them from memory. I will be making it again.

My love for kale goes even further with this recipe.  Great balance of flavors.  I used toasted almonds and dried cran-raisins and dried blueberries.

This salad was quick and delicious I used baby kale but still took off the stems. Used dried cherries and sunflower seeds instead of currants and pine nuts.

Great recipe!  Interesting comments regarding too much salt.  Don't forget some feta is saltier than others.

this was a great springboard to experimenting with more kale. I didn't have the ingredients listed so I improvised with balsamic vinegar and pumpkin seeds. I will certainly be making this salad and other variations of  it again and again!

My new favorite recipe! Along with my husband and kids, I love kale. But I always cook it to soften it up. No more. Salt massage it the way to go. Thanks, Leslie!

Love this recipe as suggested by someone I use cranberries and walnuts and may not always use the apples. I love this salad
