This recipe used too much Italian Seasoning, and it was unclear about what sauce to use in the bottom of the pan.  Do you use the sauce that has the meat mixed in it, or do you get some plain sauce to pour in the bottom of the pan.

We love this!  This is one with which I don't tinker a bit.  I follow it exactly and it always gets rave reviews.  I've been making it as my exclusive lasagna for over a year now with never-fail results.

This recipe was great! I used no bake noodles and it still turned out wonderfully. I also used less seasoning, about 2 tbls.

It tasted great and gave my husband and I a week worth of dinners. I will definitely make this again!

I am a new found cook and I find myself being held up to the reputation of my mothers delicious homemade recipes.  I decided to try this lasagna and it was so simple and fast! Cheap too! I bought all the ingredients for $10.00 and fed my boyfriend for an entire week! I would advise using a little more ricotta cheese but it tasted fantastic anyhow! Thanks for the help!

Definitely too much italian seasoning I recommend cutting it back to about 2tblsp too. I also think it couldn't hurt to use a little more shredded cheese. Will definitely be making this again but with these changes!!

This does not have enough ricotta.  You need 1 large container.  Plus it needs 1/4 cup parmesan and one egg mixed into the cheese mixture along with the mozzarella..

Made this for my very picky brother-in- law. He thought it was the best he has ever had. My daughter, who also makes a mean lasagne had to admit that it was better than her version.
Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I like this recipe for its simplicity.  Instead of garlic salt, I use 2 minced garlic cloves.  I also use 1/2lb of beef and 1/2lb italian sausage.  Like many of the other reviewers, I reduced the italian seasong to 2tbsp.

Definitely too much italian seasoning -I only ended up putting 2 tbls. I also thought it was too much tomoto sause so I didn't use all that was called for. But a great recipe though...thanks!

I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatos and another of tomato puree.  Also added some onion and garlic to the beef and let the sauce simmer about 20 minutes.  For the amount of sauce I had, the amount of herbs was about right.  I only used 8oz of noodles and don't see how you could use a full package.  Makes a nice, heavy pan of lasagna.  Mmm, comfort food!

As other members have pointed out, five tablespoons is far, far too much Italian seasoning *unless* you use the cheapy-cheapy bulk seasoning that's been sitting around for two years at Wally World. Besides that, the recipe is quite bland. I would suggest adding some dried hot pepper flakes, fresh grated Romano cheese, perhaps replacing the ground beef with either sausage or with ground pork, and adding some vegetables such as mushrooms or red peppers. As is, it's a very bland, over-herbed, under-spiced, dull recipe.

This recipe was too acidic and not that tasty.  Just a basic sauce.  I found another spaghetti with meat sauce recipe on here that tasted better than this one.  I even added 1 tsp.sugar, used only 1 tbsp. italian seasoning (that was plenty), and added pepper and onion powder.  Still did not come out right.  You really needed fresh onion and a green pepper with crushed tomatoes for a good sauce.  Pass on this one, try another one.  Disappointed with it.

Cooked for a romantic dinner last night and my husband loved it(and so did I)! I did swap the ground beef for Italian sausage and because of other reviews just sprinkled the seasoning. But was still great!

I only put 2 tbl of italian seasoning and it was still too strong.  My family thought it was ok but I won't make it again.  Also, needs about twice as much cheese.

This was quick and easy.  I only used about 2 TB of Italian seasoning since that was all I had and it was plenty.  I think if you added some sausage it would be a 5-Star recipe.  Thanks Kristy

I thought this was the easiest lasagna recipe I ever made.  I liked how it was quick and easy.  No need to take out the entire kitchen sink. There was only one thing that I changed.  I added 2 TBL spoon of sugar to remove the acid taste of the sause.  I rate this recipe an overall 5 star.

It is a good classic recipe, but I think there is too much Italian  Seasoning. I would suggest cutting it in half but everything else was great.

This recipie is not as good as Kristy makes it out to be. It is way too salty as a result of using garlic salt versus fresh garlic and 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning was too much. I'm glad I tasted it before I put in all five. It was also really bland because it calls for ground beef rather than Italian sausage. It was fast and easy to make though. I would NOT recommend this!

This is one great and easy way to make Lasagna!
I make my own italian seasoning and let my suace simmer for as long as I can.  Toss in a few mushrooms and some broccoli and it rocks!  Thanks Kristy, this is my first & last recipe for Lasagna!  :)

This was very good and quick to put together. It reheats well, too. I don't generally follow a recipe when I make lasagna, but tried this one on a whim. I'd make it again.

Way too much italian seasoning and not enough sause in my opinion.  Im glad I tried my own things with this recipe.  I also added about twice the amount of bith cheeses.

Way too much Italian seasoning and not
enough ricotta. Next time I'll use about
half as much of the first and almost
twice as much as the latter.

Good basic recipe! I added some ground pepper and sugar to the sauce to give it some more flavor. The lasagna was tasty but next time I will either increase the amount of sauce or decrease the amount of noodles. For my taste there was not enough sauce for the noodles.

I loved this recipe. I changed the italian seasoning to only 1 and 1/2 tbsp, and used 1 pound of ground beef and 1/2 a pound of italian sausage. I also loaded up on the ricotta cheese and mozz.

Awesome recipe.  It was the first time I had ever made lasagna.  I took it to a church function and it was all gone by the end of the night.  Next time I would add more ricotta cheese and mozarella cheese.  I like cheese anyways!  Bravo!

I liked making this recipe!  It was easy and impressed my family because I got to say I made the sauce HOMEMADE!  I sent a pan to a friend's family during a death in their family and they all said it was wonderful, too.  I would cut the italian seasoning down to at most 4 tbsp though.  That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star.  One more tip...I used half italian sausage and half ground beef.  Thanks for an easy delicious recipe!

I'm not sure if it's a typo, but 5 tablespoons of Italian seasoning seems like way too much.  I cut it down to about 3, and it was still too overpowering.  Maybe if it was cut to 1-2 tbsp, it would blend better.  The lasagne did turn out pretty, though!  Glad it was not for a crowd on the first try.

Good recipe! I used my own homemade spaghetti sauce instead, and used only minimal amounts of ricotta cheese, since we're not big fans of it. It gave me a nice starting point, since I had never made lasagna before. Thanks!
