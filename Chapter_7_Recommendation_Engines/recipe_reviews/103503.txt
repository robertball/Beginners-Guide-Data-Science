This recipe was very good. I omitted the green onion and sour cream. I added grated cheddar cheese to the top on the last ten minutes of baking. Also, I may have lost my mind, but I couldn't find an oven temp anywhere on this recipe so I just went with 350.

I made these tonight, with plenty of left overs...I really wanted to like this recipe, however it just lacked flavor, nothing special.  If I make it again, I will add cumin to the meat, and maybe some black olives?

This recipe was yummy.  I think that if I were to make it again I would not bake it for 40 minutes.  The shells were a little crispy.  I guessed and put the oven at 350 since it was not noted on the recipe.  Also I will put tomatoes on top next time!

Burnt my mouth cause I couldnt wait to taste, smelled too good cooking!  Perfect as is, I only added crushed tortilla chips for serving to give a little crunch to the bite.

Oh. My. God. So. Freaking. Good. I haven't tried a recipe on this site in quite awhile and...yeah, this totally exceeded my expectations. I cooked the onions in with the beef and etc instead of sprinkling them with the cheese...definitely used more salsa (I used HOT salsa so good!), and I baked it for half an hour at 350 and then put the cheese on and baked for another ten minutes. I think just half an hour would have sufficed though; the shells were a little bit over cooked. Didn't stop me from eating them though. I want to make more of these right away. Thank you Jennifer!  EDIT: I made these a second time recently.  The first time I used regular canned beans, as compared to the refried beans, because I couldn't find the refriend.  I made them with the refried this time and I think I like with the beans better.  And a tip for vegetarians: Omit the ground beef and use the refriend beans WITH canned red beans, or whatever your preference.  =0)

Nice offering for the weekend crowd.  I made it ahead, added 1/4 cup water to the bottom so it would not stick and popped it in the oven until it bubbled.  Easy to serve, as it has individual portions.  I might leave the beans out next time, there were plenty of things in there already.

I have a different version.  I warm the beans with a tab of butter that I sauteed onions in--add 1 cup of mex cheese.  stuffed shells.  Used the ground beef mixture with 2 cans drained chopped tomatoes with green chilies .  used1/4  enchalada sauce on bottom of dish.  add shells.  pour beef mixture cover with lots of cheddar jack and more sauce.  then...cover with lots of doritios.  this is full of calories, carbs and fat, but is GREAT for an occasional treat.  Makes enough for leftovers...which are even better!!!!!!  Have fun with the flavors. it's hard to mess this up. chips add a nice crunch.

Fantastic!!  Although this recipe did NOT need changing, I did make a few and I am simply noting them here so I will know what I did for next time.  And there WILL be a next time!

Instead of the refried beans I added 4 oz. of low fat cream cheese, 2-3 TBS of the salsa and a little handful of shredded cheese to the beef mixture. I was able to fill 20 shells....and didn't skimp.

I also used a a medium taco sauce with the salsa on the bottom of pan as well as on top of shells... gave it a nice tacoy flavor.

Served my refried beans on the side.

DELISH!!

Pretty good.  The major change I made was to use enchilada sauce in place of the salsa.  I also used my own seasonings instead of packaged taco seasoning and water mix.  I somehow forgot to add the cheese to the meat and bean mixture so I just put it on top during the last 6 or 7 minutes..  Oh and total coking times for mine was only 25 minutes and they came out just fine.

This was SOOO good!  I added a can of rotel to the meat when it was done browning, and let it cook down a bit, but that was the only change I made.  I could have JUST eaten the stuffing mixture, it was delish!  Will make again!

Really good dish...I added onions and garlic to the meat mixture and substituted the salsa on top with a ten ounce can of mild enchilada sauce.  I'd make this again!

Fun and yummy dinner! I used Enchilada sauce since that just sounded better to me instead of salsa. I had enough filling to make 22 shells and froze half of them. Try it with some cilantro on top!

Very good recipe, I skipped the beans just because we didn't have any, next time I'll add them. I did add a bit of water and some diced jalapeno peppers, for an extra kick. Thanks!

BEST Recipe I have made in a while!!!  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes then put the cheese on top and baked until melted.  An easier way to fill the shells, as it is very messy with a spoon, is to cut the corner off of a ziplock bag and pipe it into the shells, just piping frosting on a cake.

This was really really good. I used a cheese taco flavored seasoning (can't remember which brand, maybe McCormick or Lawry's?) and a half can of black beans (drained and rinsed) instead of refried since they were open in my fridge. I topped this with some PepperJack as I didn't have enough Cheddar once I finished the filling. I used Julio's brand medium salsa in the jar. (It's a Texas product)  We loved this and I will definitely fix this again! Thanks Jennifer for a wonderful filling meal.

Used 6 servings of Seasoning For Tacos for the taco seasoning. This was a pretty good recipe. I like the mixture of ground beef and refried beans. Also, I ran out of Cheddar cheese after the 3/4 cup so I replaced the 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese topping with Fiesta Blend cheese.

these were amazingly good.  I made them for a potluck dinner and they were the first pan emptied.  It looked as though the pan had been licked clean.  Since I doubled the recipe, I did make a couple of changes.I used both the regular and hot taco mix, and mild and medium salsa mixed together, since I didn't know the "spice" level of the group.  They were excellent.  Thank you for a wonderful and tasty recipe.  I made them early in the day, a heated them in a 300F oven for an hour.  Took a guess at the oven temp as I couldn't find it in the recipe and that worked just fine.

Excellent starter recipe. The only thing I changed was to add fresh tomatoes diced, olives and white onions to the top layer of cheese. I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes then added my cheese and baked for another 10 minutes, based on other reviews. YUMMY!

Very good. I improvised a bit based on some ingredients I needed to use up.  I stirred in about 4 oz of cream cheese to the meat mixture and boiled enough shells to fill a 9x13 pan.  Baked covered @ 350 for about a half hour and then covered with cheese and green onion for about 15 minutes.  Everyone enjoyed!

I added taco seasoning to the ground beef/cream cheese mixture.  It was a good move.  I contemplated omitting the crushed tortilla chips (because I thought it sounded a little weird), but I forged ahead and used them - although I only put a dusting over each shell...  I came no where close to using the entire cup-an-a-half.  The shells were as fun to make as they were to eat!

My husband really liked these.  I wasn't sure if he would becuase he's not a big fan of refried beans but it didn't phase him at all.  He wants me to make these on a regular basis!

We loved this!  Often my family and I will choose a recipe to try, then as we eat, we critique the results and decide what we would change in the future.  The biggest decision is always, "will we repeat this recipe?"  This was a resounding yes for these stuffed shells.  The only change made to the preparation was the use of a bit more salsa.  1/4 c. seemed too little for the bottom of the pan, so 1/2 c. was used.  Also, 3/4 c. to top remaining shells seemed too little once it had been doled out.  I found that I stopped measuring the salsa topping and just made sure that there was enough to cover each shell well so that the pasta did not become crunchy.  Like other readers, I cooked this at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, then during the last 10 minutes covered it with shredded cheese before returning it to the oven.  This dish was even better on day 2!  Delicious!

This is a favorite during our summer vacations. Feeds 5 big boys; nothing left! Started baking at 350, but upped the temp to 375 to move it along.

I couldn't stop eating these. Was so good and easy to make. I did add a clove of garlic to the meat while it was cooking. Also added sliced black olives and shredded lettuce. Thought sliced tomato like suggested would be too much, but I do think after trying it that they'd be a good addition. Great recipe.

These were very good!  The kids loved them. I did not add the refried beans to the meat mixture instead I added a chopped  onion  into the beans and spread on the bottom of the shells, then added the rest of the ingredients.  A very good dish! Thanks.

My kids loved this!  I doubled it and still didn't have enough! I put out lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, extra salsa and sour cream for the kids to put on top if they wanted.  I may try it as a "lasagna" next time, just to save myself time.  Thanks for the great recipe, the kids told me to not forget this one!

Such a good recipe!!! My family couldn't get enough of it. I substituted the re fried beans for regular baked beans in a tomato sauce, cut up onion and cooked it with the ground beef. Also I took it out after 30 minutes and sprinkled shredded cheese over top and baked for another 5-6 minutes. Will make this again and suggest this to any family that loves a Mexican twist on pasta!

I also guessed and put the oven at 350, and didn't cook for the full time. They came out really tasty though, and are really hearty and filling!

This recipe was excellent! I loved it! So easy and so amazingly flavourful. The only change I made was to use refried beans that had green chiles in them too, just because I like my food spicy. I did end up with left over filling, so I froze with plans to use it on nachos some night.

so, so good.....made this with my own salsa and used my own guacamole as a topping.  I have two little girls that are picky eaters and they devoured this!  We also had one of their friends eat over and she told me I was the best cook ever!  Better than her dad(who is the cook in their house)!  This kid will not hesitate to say something's too dry or burnt, etc.  so I considered that quite a compliment......definitely kid friendly!

A tasty alternative! Mixed in a 16 oz tub of cottage cheese to spread this meal a little further and it worked great. Followed the recipe to the T otherwise. Good stuff. Might try black beans next time.

This is a 5 star recipe. The only two minor things I changed was I used turkey meat instead of beef and added some leftover cotija cheese to the mixture. As for the taco seasoning and salsa, I used spicy for both. The end result was amazing. If you thought this had no flavor, you probably did something wrong to the recipe. I made enough for a couple of meals and they went really fast. Will definitely make again!

Made this was great. A few changes such as adding a can of Campbell's Nacho Cheese and used Mexican style cheese. My neighbors loved it. Going to use this recipe for enchiladas. ??

I absolutley love this recipe. I took the advice of the comments and used enchilada sauce in place of the salsa and the heat and flavor were perfect. I also put the shredded cheese on top right when I put it in the oven. 350 for 25 min was perfect for getting a super gooey cheesy topping. Since my boyfriend and I are watching our weight this is unfortunately a once a month only dish since we tend to eat the whole thing within a 24 hour period. It's that good.

These were really good. A bit time consuming and messy to make but really worth it. I made exactly as stated above but I did add a layer of cheese to the top, say 3/4 cup and baked for ten minutes or so at the end just to really get that stuffed shell feeling. I will so be making these again as a fun meal for the family

We absolutely loved this recipe. I did however cut the baking time to 30 minutes instead of 40. I also used my own taco seasoning instead of buying store bought! 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1 tbsp ground cumin and 1 tbsp garlic powder. This made this recipe very flavorful. I will definitely make this again to get my taco fix!

Totaly delish!! I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. So I made it for dinner a few nights ago, and served them on a small bed of lettuce. My hubby and I loved it! Having the taco flavored meat in the pasta was a great twist on the traditional version, and the lettuce lighted it up a little. I microwaved the leftovers the following nite and it was just as moist as the first nigh; only we thought it had a better flavor, after the flavors had a chance to marry overnight, just like regular pasta dishes do. I will def make it again.

Delicious!  I almost added a can of diced tomatos to the filling but I decided to be different and make the recipe as it was written.  I'm glad I did.  It was delicious.  I instead cooked the tomatos with a can of black beans and served on the side.  A keeper for sure! (makes lots of filling, so i recommend more like 20 shells)

We really liked the filling, and it would make a wonderful filling for soft tacos or a taco casserole, but I wasn't a huge fan of the shells.  That's not the recipe's fault, however, just personal preference.

Absolutely delicious. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I had to double the recipe to feed the family. I loved the beans, it made the dish heartier. I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes to the salsa and poured it over the top. After 15 minutes of baking, I added green onion, black olives, green chiles, and jalapenos. I had a green salad and spanish rice on the side. This fed a family of 5 with no leftovers!

This recipe was very good. However, it tasted just like Chili-mac. It would of been much easier if I had just thrown everything together like you do with "chili-mac" instead of going thru the trouble of stuffing the shells. I am giving it 3 stars because it was good.

This recipe was an explosion of falvor for my mouth! I crushed up some tortilla chips and sprinkled them on top of the shells once they were done baking to add some crunch and I added diced chiles into the meat other than that I did what the recipe said! Thanks for the great recipe :-)

YUM!!!  I had a little more ground beef so I used more than 16 shells.  I also used a little over a jar and 1/2 of salsa, it just didn't seem like enough and we used majority of the first jar to cover the bottom of the 9X13 dish, then made sure that all of the shells were completely covered so they wouldn't get hard.  Cooked at 350 for 30 minutes, then put cheese and green onions on and backed for another 5 minutes.  Will definitely be making this recipe again!!

This dish was O.K.  I didn't dislike it but I would not rate it at the top either.  I did use a 24 oz jar of thick and chunky salsa and I am glad I did.  I may make it again for an get together.

These were awesome! I used homemade refried beans and salsa as I refuse to buy either due to the increase in price. Will be making these again! Family loved them. I did add some water in the baking pan to keep them from getting hard on the bottom.

Good enough stuff. A lot of work. I followed advice of previous ratings, lowered cooking time, enchilada sauce in addition to salsa, added black olives. Basically a good recipe. Lacking something...

I have made this several times, with Vegan changes. I used Boca crumbles instead of beef, added a small can of green chillis', and Follow Your Heart shredded cheese.Even non Vegan friends enjoy this!

The taste was good!! Mine were definitely overlooked. I cooked them at 350. The shells were very hard, but the taste was really great! Honestly pretty much what you'd expect from the taste. I probably in the future will just make tacos.

The recipe is simple to follow but how good it tastes really hinges on liking the taco seasoning and salsa you use. For that reason and because it makes filling for probably 20-22 shells rather than 16, I only give it four stars. That being said, mine turned out great using Ortega ingredients and I will definitely be making it again one day.

Had to modify it a bit to feed a family of five (double the recipe ingredients and a used Mexican blend instead of cheddar cheese) and add extra seasoning (2 packets of Sazon, salt, garlic and onion powder)  but they came out completely awesome. I can't wait to make this again.

I made this dish and it was great. Instead of putting the refried beans in the shell, I put the beans in the bottom of the baking dish and put the stuffed shells on top.  That way if anyone did not want to beans, it wasn't cooked in the dish....thanks so much for the recipe, it was a hit at my house last night!

What a FABULOUS dish! My very picky, meat and potatoes only husband said hands down one of his favorite dishes! The only thing I changed up, from reading reviews, was adding cumin, cooking it for 30 minutes then adding the cheese AND the green onions to cook for last 10 minutes!

I make this every couple months.  I use cream cheese instead of the beans (I'm the only one that likes them) I use hot sauce along with the salsa and I put the grated Mexican blend cheese on top with jalapeno slices. Serve with sour cream and guacamole or avocado sliced. My daughter likes it topped with broken up Tostito's.

So good! However, I used my own seasoning for the meat; cumin, season salt, black pepper and garlic powder.  I mixed some salsa into the beef and bean mixture. I had enough to stuff about 20 shells.

A huge hut with my kids and visiting grandparents! Only change was to put a can of enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and stirred in the 8oz of salsa into the meat mixture instead of the taco seasoning (I didn't realize I was out). But the mix up was so good that I'm leaving it like that!!!

I was so excited to makes these. I followed the directions. They did not taste good. The filling might have tasted good in a burrito with cheese, sour cream, salsa and lettuce, but not good in a pasta shell.

This was a five star.  This is my first review after many, many years.  I added 4 chopped Roma tomatoes, half in the meat mixture and half on top.  I used 1 pouch (8 oz) Old El Paso™ roasted tomato Mexican cooking sauce instead of the taco seasoning.  Oh my, my, my we could not stop eating them. We actually got 24 nicely stuffed shells and they fit perfectly in the 9 by 13 pan. A definite keeper. Thanks Jennifer.

I made this tonight for the football games. Everyone loved it! My 1 year old son even had two shells. The only thing i did different was i put queso dip on the bottom of the pan with the salsa. Then i put a spoonfull of queso over each shell before i put the salsa ontop of the shells. Soo good. I baked coverd with foil for 20 mins at 350 then removed the foil and baked a little longer.

These were great! So easy to make! I made the shells and meat at the same time.  It took me more than 16 shells.

My family thought these were pretty good.  I used the taco seasoning I recipe from this site, which gave them a bit more spice.  And I used homemade refried beans.  I did have to use a lot more shells than the recipe called for.  Next time I might try using homemade salsa and mixing some salsa into the meat mixture so that the meat mixture is not so heavy.

I changed a few things... Substituted chicken for beef, seasoned black beans for refrained beans and added Rotel tomatoes and chiles as well as green onion to filling. I added cheese the last 10 minutes of baking. 
My family loved it!!

I think this was really lacking in flavor. It needs more spices in the meat. It was just ok for me.

Only change I made was using black beans instead of refried.  These were excellent.

My family loved this, including my 2 year old!! Although, I did need several more jumbo shells than the recipe specified. Next time, I will double the number of shells, or at least add 1/2 as many (1.5 as many as the recipe states).

This was great - what a fun idea and spin on traditional stuffed shells.  I did add 1 can of tomato sauce, in addition to the salsa, because I just thought it needed a little more sauce.  Other than that, I made it exactly as stated (I just omitted the green onions as my kids don't care for those) and the whole family loved it.  My 7 year old had 3 helpings.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Excellent dish.  Used only 1/2 the beans and added cheese later, but it was definitely a hit in my family.

This is a favorite!! It was easily made vegan by ising Yves Mexican soy crumbles and Daiya "cheese". I bought refriend beans with green chilis to give a little kick. I think next time I'll add black olives...otherwise it's perfect!!

I've made this recipe a couple of times. I followed the ingredients exactly. My boys hate refried beans, didn't even notice they were in this dish...and THEY LOVE IT! I believe the combo of beans and meat in the filling are excellent. It's very yummy. I recommend!!

This was a great dish.  I made the mistake of using too little salsa, so it was a little dry - but with more salsa it would be wonderful.

These were great!! I made a few without beans because I don't like them. I used taco sauce on the bottom of the pan because My salsa is thick and chunky so I didn't want them to stick. Everyone that ate them loved them. I think next time I will make them and freeze them for another night when I'm in not home and my boyfriend has to put something in the oven for dinner. I will make these again and agian.

I loved this recipe. A nice change from the traditional stuffed shells. I tried adding a little water to the bottom to keep the shells from sticking (although I have never had a problem with this) and it completely watered down my already watery store bought salsa! (I really should make my own). It ended up being quite a spicy treat too because my boyfriend's hot salsa ran into my mild! I added onion and green pepper to the meat and cheese. Overall, delicious!

Very good- my husband gives this  4 stars- I cooked 1/2 an onion with my meat- I don't use taco seasoning ever- too easy to use cumin, chile powder, garlic, salt and pepper- so water was not necessary- turned out excellent for me- served with "best spanish rice" and more beans. yum. used "pace".

Made this 2 days ago, and made 2 dishes, one to cook, other in the freezer. I cut the recipes in half as there's only 2 of us. /baked the one last night and must say, we loved it.. Very tasty as is.I did add more Taco sauce to the dish, prior to baking. Thanks Jennifer,will put this into my "keeper" file.. We really enjoyed this.Has a subtle mexican flavor, but also  has a similar lasagna flavor..LOVED IT!

Wonderful! Easy to make and the ingredients are cheap. I left out the beans  because my husband and I don't like them. I also added water to the pan before baking and added cheese to the top during the last 10 minutes of baking. Yum!!
