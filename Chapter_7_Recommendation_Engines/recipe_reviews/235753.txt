This soup is exactly what it says it is! I was looking for something I could make with ingredients on hand and found this. Very rich, yummy and satisfying. I was worried about making dumplings from scratch but these were very good and not too difficult.

When I originally read the recipe I saw that this used two separate pots, which seemed burdensome to me.   I've always made my potatoes in the broth and added in the dumplings when the potatoes were almost done.   Much easier than this way, but the cooking the potatoes separately in butter added a great new level to the broth.   I will most likely use this technique again as the broth was fantastic.   5 star for sure.   However, the dumplings were 3 star at best.   They would have benefited from more egg.   It makes them a little less dense.   Also the dill was completely out of place.   I'm not sure about the parsley because the dill was so strong.   So I like this recipe, but the dumplings need help, which is ok.   I also thought that there was too much pepper, and would likely cut that by close to half next time.   The last thing is that the broth didn't thicken up, and it could stand a little thickener (corn starch & water) towards the end of the cook time.

I have a favorite diner in Minot that serves knoefla as a daily soup and I never get to North Dakota any more (worked there for years) so I decided to try this recipe because I missed the soup so much. Followed the recipe to the T, and it was probably the best soup to ever come from my stove. It’s absolutely perfect. I even quadrupled the recipe to serve at my sister in laws restaurant, boy was that a job lol all those perfect little dumplings ?? 

I highly recommend this soup. Good for all ages and you’ll look like a rock star chef whippin this bad bear up this winter. Nice work.

Love this soup.  The only thing we do differently is 1/2 the pepper amount for both amounts.  We’ve made this several times now..... perfect now.

Loved this recipe. I found it easy to make and loved the pepper taste. If you don’t like things to hot, I suggest using less pepper. I loved it just they way it was.

I was lazy and had pre packed dough. Next time I will make the dough too. I also used only 1 cup water and the rest chicken broth. I only used 2 potatoes but used carrots and celery instead of the third

It’s very good. If your not a fan of a lot of pepper, I’d use less than it says, maybe half. Other than that it was wonderful!

A tasty soup that I’d make again. I added fresh dill to broth and dumplings- I thought it was a nice addition. I think I would use less butter next time, maybe 1/3 cup, and I think I would add another egg to the dumpling.

I made no changes. I wish it would be thicker, less milky but the flavor is awesome.
