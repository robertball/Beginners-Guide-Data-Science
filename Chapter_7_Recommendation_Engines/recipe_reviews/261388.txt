I agree with at least one other reviewer that, as written, this recipe is bland and "lacks something". So here's what I did: I made my Rice first (1 cup Jasmine), cooking it stove-top (for 12 minutes, covered) in 2.5 cups of water to which I had added 2 Tbls. "Better Than Bouillon" (I used Vegetable; but Beef or Chicken could be used instead; bouillon cubes or granules or cartoned stock can be used, also). While the Rice was cooking, I chopped the Bok Choy. Once the Rice was cooked,  I added the Bok Choy plus 2 Tbls. grated Parmesan cheese to its pot, stirred it up a bit and set it aside (covered) to "sit" (10 minutes). While the Rice was "sitting",  I cooked the onion, some minced Garlic and the Sausage as  described above.  Let's face it -- this dish is never going to be Lasagna, Chicken Cordon Bleu or whatever your favorite meal is. But it is healthy and economical. And -- with the adjustments I made -- both my DH and I  thought it was quite flavorful, too. Enjoy. :)

This  is the first time I have eaten bok choy and this recipe turned out to be very good.  It looks so beautiful!  I may add potatoes next time!

This was okay and I liked the idea of only 4 ingredients but that shows in the finished dish. It lacks something. I'm not sure what but it needs a couple more ingredients. The grease from the sausage wasn't enough to flavor the bok choy. If serving over rice as I did, it needs a sauce. This has potential but as written it is bland. Sorry.
