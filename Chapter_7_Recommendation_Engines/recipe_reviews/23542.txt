My cousin, the gelatin shot queen, taught me the trick of lightly spraying the cups with ***original Pam***...(only original Pam works she says), before adding the liquid.  The shots will slide out like they are supposed to.  Bottoms up!

I make these for parties all the time with all sorts of flavored gelatin.  I recommend using flavored liquor and sugar-free gelatin - it seems to help cut the taste of the alcohol a bit.  And I was SO excited to see new gelatin flavors of margarita, pina colada, and strawberry daiquiri.  Yummy!

My favorite party drink! But as a bartender, I constantly try to improve recipes, so here's what I did.  I prepared the Jell-O shots as stated, but on the side used a melon baller to dissect a melon into little balls. I placed the balls on a triple or quadruple paper towel-lined cookie sheet and let them sit at room temperature for a couple of hours, until the paper towels dried the melon balls out. I put the dehydrated melon balls in a bowl filled with vodka (or Everclear alcohol would work) and allowed them to soak, covered, for about an hour. I removed and lightly dried each ball, and placed one into the center of each slightly firm Jell-O shot. Served with whip cream when fully firm. 
It goes down like water and hits you with a harder punch. You can also put them in a full Jell-O mold or Bundt pan and slice it up for your pleasure. Enjoy!!

These are yummylicious! Place in small 4 oz size plastic bathroom cups. This really works well with pure grain as well. Be careful, this will sneak up on ya! Please be responsible when eating these, don't eat many of these and drive.

This Jello to Vodka ratio worked out very well. They were just the right potency to be a hit with the crowd. Instead of using regular Vodka, I used Rasberry Vodka for one batch and Green Apple Vodka on another.

always a hit at a party or tailgate. i would also recommend using flavored vodka and or rum. coconut rum is a good one to use. keep in mind that the ratios of water and alcohol can be altered depending on the percent of alcohol used. also, a bit of whipped cream on top can be a great addition. last tip, bathroom solo cups work great as well and are cheap and disposable.

I never have made jello shots but I loved this recipe! Wondering why I haven't made this sooner. I just finished making 200 1oz shots and it was so easy. This year I wanted to find something economical for our Superbowl party since we have so many guests. Tried this recipe with 1 oz shot cups with lids since that size was recommended by someone. The lids also make it easy to stack. I also halfed the recipe so that I can make many different flavors and used a cheap bottle of 1.75 liter of vodka. Very surprised because I still have a decent amount left to start a new batch! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've been making these for years, ever since I first got my own studio apartment. They never lose their appeal, even years later. I love to make them now with the newer flavors of Jello, like the Blackberry Fusion. Even better if you mix your alcohol, like berry vodka and raspberry schnapps.

I made over a hundered of these for tailgating a few weeks ago and they were gone!  For this weeks game I made orange jello with vanilla vodka, like a cremesicle (sp?) and lemon jello with bacardi limon.  Of course I added some red food coloring to the lemon jello, so it's our team color and not yellow.  Perfect proportions!  Solo makes the perfect sized cup that comes with lids for easy transporting to the game.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!

These were yummy! I made them with lime and orange Jell-O for St. Paddy's day and they were soooo good! However, if you're shooting for a sugar-free option, try another recipe alltogether, because sugar-free does NOT work.

Very good! I used lime vodka and lime flavored jello. Very "limey". I couldn't find plastic shot glasses anywhere, so I just used the smallest cups I could find. Also I cut the recipe in half. Forgot to buy the bigger sized jello.

I made two trays. One with vodka and strawberry jello. I used the same recipe for the second tray, but subbed in 99 bananas for the vodka. Both trays went over well, but the banana one was a bigger hit at the party. I would make these again.

I have been making these for years and know them as Jell-O Shooters.  I find the small 1.25oz paper party cup works best (found in a party supply store) as you can just pinch it at the bottom and suck it out!  It is hard to get it out of the plastic cup, plus the paper costs less!  Anyone who drinks LOVES them.  I suggest staying with the water liquor combo suggested no more than 1 ½ cups liquor.  Anymore liquor and your company should NOT drive and will have to stay the night because these can be addicting!  And watch out for any kid’s that may be around because they think it is a cool treat for them, colorful, sweet and all!  I've made with Tequila (Tequila Shots), and any flavor Jell-O (gelatin) you feel like.  Sugar free works just as well and I use it when I have it. I have also used vodka and moonshine, careful with the moonshine as it is higher proof and has a real KICK!  These are always a hit at parties - unless you happen to be with a group of non drinkers.  My 86 year old mom LOVES them!

We have been doing these type of shots for a LONG time. Don't be affraid to use different types of alcohol. We have used tequila, rum whiskey. When making a real strawberry daiquiri you use rum not vodka... just think of the mixed drink you would like to copy and try it!

These turned out great! I doubled the recipe and used the Tropical Fusion flavored jello and banana flavored rum. They tasted great but lacked the boozy drunk punch. I think next time I'll increase the alcohol a bit.

Also well known as jello shots.. these little babies do the trick. If you don't have that many shot glasses you can use a cookie sheet and cut into squares. Last halloween i made these and added gummy worms to them for the creeping, fun effective.

I make these every year for our annual tubing trip and they're a hit! I cut down on the water and substitute with more vodka for a little extra spike and they're even better! ;) Thanks for sharing!

I used strawberry Jello—2 packages.  Doubling the recipe for all ingredients.  I did do 1 1/2 cups moonshine and 1/2 cup water—per package.  They were a big hit at the Christmas Party.

I changed this up just a bit! Since were using this recipe for 2oz Individual plastic cups for Jell-O shots, I coated each cup with olive oil for easy removal. I also used 1-1/3 alcohol instead of 1-1/4. Delicious!

I wasn't sure how to make jello shots & I wanted to take something to different to a friends party. I had Pinnacle Whipped Flavor vodka on hand & strawberry jello. I used this recipe to incorporate those together. Everyone at the party loved them! I got asked to make them again for the next gathering!

Great!  I used flavored vodka to match the jello flavors and that was ideal.  Left more of the jello smell vs. alcohol smell and they were good and tasty.  Everyone enjoyed.  Easy to do.

This are a huge hit at parties.  I usually pair the shots with a trivia game to get the party started.  I walk around the party with a tray shots, approach a pair or a group with a question and the winner gets to pick the shot flavor for the loser.

Some flavor combinations that work well -
Jolly Rancher's Apple Jello with Fireball
Jolly Rancher's Watermelon with plain vodka (or maybe tequila?)
Lime Jello with Tequila
Pineapple Jello with Rumchatta (my fav).

FYI- cherry jello tastes like cough syrup as a jello shooter.

Great recipe, made 2 batches for my friends batchelorette party with Skyy Vodka, 1 with Strawberry jello and 1 with blue raspberry.  Went a little heavier on the Vodka and they still tasted great! everyone loved them.  If you are short on time you can put them in the freezer and they setup faster!  Yum! def making again.
