My mother watches the latest Allrecipes and FoodWishes videos on Youtube every week. She sent me this one and said, "I want you to make it!" Chef John's Ba'corn didn't disappoint. So yummy. We ate it as a side dish with grilled burgers and a summer salad.

Loved this yummy dish! Followed recipe but cut in half for 5 servings. Hubby loved so much he had seconds and then had some for breakfast the next day. Very filling and bacon-y, would be great for any gathering. Served it w/ roasted shrimp and homemade cocktail sauce; delicious! Thanks for another winner, Chef John! We always choose your recipes first!

Spot on perfection!  Kudos Chef...

I went heavier on the bacon but I do on almost all those dishes that call for it.  This dish would be killer with anything BBQ as a side.  This one is keeper from here on out.

I will never feel the same way about corn! This dish had a rockin' party in my mouth. Chef, I couldn't go light on this one. 6 oz of sweetened condensed milk  perfectly complimented the jalopeno and smoky bacon. YUM!

This was very good. I cooked the bacon in the oven then just used some of the grease. I only had a Colby jack shredded and cheddar shredded so I also added some grated cojito cheese to give it a little to punch. I may not have defrosted the corn long enough but it came out great. I would make again. Would be great as a side for thanksgiving if you have the oven or broiler space.

I made this to use as a side dish for some grilled sandwiches I was planning on making. I couldn't stop eating the corn and never got around to making the sandwiches!!!

The guys really loved this! I used fresh corn and a poblano because my BF forgot to buy jalapeno. Can't wait to do it with a hotter pepper!

Made just as the recipe said, more or less.  I don’t think I used enough cheese though... I will definitely make again. Family loved it.

This was absolutely AMAZING. Thank you Chef John. I laughed when you said you normally do not lighten up a recipe but this one you did. I cut the recipe quantity in half and I did not have heavy cream so I used what I had, some half and half and it turned out delicious. Hub’s was beside himself and loved every bite as well as the leftovers. Super easy, will be my go to recipe whenever I have bacon and corn on hand. Cheers

Very good, was worried would be too spicy with the jalapeños but the flavor was great with the bacon and it only added a tiny bit of heat. Didn’t have a cast iron, so I cooked in a large non stick skillet then transferred to a glass casserole dish for the oven. Turned out perfect!

This was amazing. I added this to my Thanksgiving sides and people were scrapping the bottom of the skillet. Everyone asked for the recipe. I didn't change anything with the recipe and it had great flavors. Will be making this again.
