A good combination of nutrients and flavours. I added some hot sauce and lime juice at the end and liked it even more. Thank you for the recipe.

Really good basic recipe. Definitely will be adding some spices next time.  I used fresh spinach leaves instead of lettuce, since the heat would have wilted the lettuce. Added lime juice and used regular (non-vegan) sour cream and cheese.  Overall, fairly easy to make and will be trying again.
