I have made this recipe a number of times.  My family loves it.  For the person who didn't like it the next day, try toasting it and adding butter.  We have gone through an entire loaf this way in one sitting.

Great recipe. I was looking for a bread to make to use up some pepperoni. I halved the recipe and used Rapid Rise yeast. I added the Rapid Rise yeast to all the dry ingredients, except the cheese and pepperoni, stirred it all together. Heated up the water and margarine to 120* and added it to the dry ingredients, stirring together.  Using my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook attachment, I kneaded the dough for a minute or two, then add the cheese and about 1/3 cup chopped up pepperoni and kneaded another minute or two, just until it formed a ball. I removed the dough hook and covered the mixing bowl with a towel and let it sit for 10 minutes. I greased a 1-1/2 quart casserole and placed the dough that I shaped into a ball in it and covered for 1 hour. I sprinkled the top with some of the cheese and baked it for 45 minutes at 350*, then removed from dish to a wire rack. Using just a little more margarine, I coated the top. Not only did it look beautiful, it tasted great. This is a keeper...and so easy!

I make this bread on a regular basis.  It is great with cheese and pepperoni as suggested.  My mother in law loves it plain as well.  If it's a pasta night in our house, this bread is usually on the table.

This is a good tasting bread....but only when eaten immediately.  I didn't find it tasted very good the next day.

The first time I made this I liked it. The second time I doubled up on the oregano, added basil, whole garlic cloves, extra parmesan...the results were amazing...we LOVED it. It makes a really great grilled garlic bread as well as a mini pizza. Great!

You do need to trust this recipe.  The dough will be really slack and you will literally pour it into the casserole, but it works!  It has a crisp crust and a very moist crumb and is wonderful toasted.  I used mixed Italian seasoning and didn't measure the cheese, just dumped in a bunch.  My husband's verdict?  "Remember how you did this!"  A great recipe for when you want bread but don't really feel like baking.  It's that easy!  Make sure you grease the casserole really well so it doesn't stick.

I made this bread recently to go with Herbed Chicken Pasta from this site. I messed up a little during the rising step, but it still came out crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. I did use Italian seasoning blend instead of just oregano and added extra Parmesan cheese. Anyway turned out great and I'll be making this again soon!!!!

My BF made this exchanging half the flour for whole wheat and the other with bread flour.  Used homegrown rosemary and substituted butter.  Baked it in a 9 1/2" springform pan and it was the best bread I've ever eaten.  We aren't normally bread eaters but I wanted to try his bread since he'd been making mention of his bread making experiences for years, now.  This is a keeper!

Very nice! Good consistancy, and quite flavourful. I'm pretty sure I used more then a 1/2 cup of Parm. (Didn't measure, just dumped :) I wanted a really nice strong herb flavor, so for ease, I just used some Italian seasoning, which worked GREAT! Thanx for sharing this great recipe. Will deffinetly make again!

I gave this a 5-Star because it has 5-star potential. I followed the recipe as published, using my bread maker. First, I added some chopped garlic, about a clove, or maybe 2 tsp of the garlic in a jar. GREAT addition. However, my experience was that the 2 cups of water called for is WAY too much. I had to add an aditional 2-3 cups of flour. And because I added so much more flour, it diluted the parmesan and oregano taste (I should have realized that when I was adding the flour; duh). So next time to fix all of my problems, I'm gonna add 1 cup of water, and only more as needed. I'll add the garlic, and do the rest as directed. Oh and I put some parmesan cheese in some butter and smeared it all over the top once it came out of the oven. AWESOME! Other than all the trouble with the water, it was really wonderful and in fact, this bread was what we had for dinner. Just the bread!! I think I'm gonna make some more of this right now!!

Pretty good bread. You'll have to like the taste of oregeno for you to like this bread. Also, the recipe doesn't call for enough flour. I had to add probably another 1.5 cups in order to get it to the constancy I could work with. I also didn't have a round casserole dish, so I just shaped it and put it on a greased cookie sheet and it worked just fine. It was delicious toasted with double tomato bruschetta on top.

This is excellent bread. I didn't enjoy it so much when it was hot, but the next day - toasted with butter - oh man. Awesome! I was really skeptical heading into this. Bread with no kneading? But wow. I made this EXACTLY as the recipe outlined (I even just hand-stirred it very briefly for the second addition of flour). This needs NO TWEAKING. It really does look like batter, not regular bread dough. Do not panic! It works out fiiiine. Trust me. It has an excellent crust, and a moist, somewhat crumbly (but not bisquit-y) crumb. I will be making this again, if only for use as toast! Thanks.

I cut this in half to make one loaf. I proofed the yeast in my Kitchen Aid mixer bowl with the sugar and warm water for ten minutes. After the ten minutes, I added the melted butter, then the dry ingredients and seasoning. I needed to add another 1/4 cup of flour to get it to completely form into a ball and jump on the hook. I kneaded it with the bread hook for five minutes, then set it to rise in a greased, covered bowl for a  couple of hours on a hot oven. I had a heck of a time getting it to rise. After it doubled, I formed it into a loaf and set it to rise again in the bread pan on the warm oven. It took another couple hours to rise. It baked up well, it just kind of seemed like a balloon that lost it's air. The loaf came out with crusty sides and the texture inside was similar to a beer bread. I did add a half tsp. of garlic powder when I added the spices, I made no other changes. Next time, I'll read through the whole recipe before I try it, a novel concept. I was tired. I served this with Pepperoni Casserole. Not our favorite bread, but it was tasty.

This bread is absolutely delicious!  I make it in the bread maker and cut it from 20 servings to 15 servings and it fit very nicely.  The oregano and parmesan add a unique twist that me and my husband loved!  We will definitely be making this again and again! Oh, and I tried it as a crust for pizza and it was too was delicious!

YUM!  This is awesome recipe.  I add additional parmesan cheese on top before baking.  It's a big hit with the bread co-op I participate in!  It's so easy.  And yes, make sure you just trust the recipe, even though it looks like it's not right, just try it!

This bread is awesome!  I only used one tblsp of oregeno.  And next time I'll be sure to do the 2nd flour addition by hand...the mixer made a mess out of it!  But the bread turned out great and freezes well too.

I have made this twice now and get 2 loaves from the recipe.  I just mix the dough in the bread machine then take it out and make the loaves.  I can always tell by touching the dough if it is going to be good and this is definately a "10" if it were rated that high. Thank you for the recipe.

I haven't made bread in 40+ years but tried this recipe because my wife jokingly told me I couldn't make a decent loaf of bread because I'm a guy and, up to now, she's done all the bread making.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  The loaf turned out a bit doughy but I didn't want to give it more time in the oven because the crust was already very brown so I did't want to risk burning the crust.  Notwithstanding  this, the result was edible (especially if I toast it to decrease the doughiness) and quite tasty.  The bottom line...  not a bad result for a first try at bread making in 40+ years.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the directions, only substitution Italian herbs for oregano since I did not have enough oregano, but mine was nowhere near the consistency of batter that I see many writing about.  Mine was a tacky ball not even close to pourable.  Smells great in the oven.

This is the easiest and fastest bread that I ever baked!  I subistuted Ramano cheese for the parmesan and added some fresh bail and rosemary with the oregano, it is much better than the bakery artisan bread from up the street.  Family favorite now and I think I will be doing more bread baking than I ever did in the past!

Super bread! Used romano cheese and whatever I could snip off in my Aerogarden.  This turned out beautifully..if not a bit big in the 2 qt. casserole. I imagine any low moisture cheese would work well.  This was a great and simple recipe that can be tweaked to your hearts desire. The best thing is one rise and no kneading so there is little room for MESS and error.

This didn't work for me.  I put it in my bread machine and thought after that I should have halved it.  Sure enough, I have a overflowed mess!  Plus with the addition of the all purpose flour it was almost cakey to me.  This just wasn't my thing.  Maybe I could try again, but I"m not sure I will.

Very yummy!  Crusty outside and soft inside.  Would like to try it with fresh grated parm. cheese.

This was delicious and super easy to make.  We ate about half the loaf right out of the oven.  A bit dry the second day, but awesome toasted.

This bread turned out pretty good, it looked very nice when it came out of the oven & smelled awesome while it was baking.  The only alteration I made was to use an asiago/romano/parmesan cheese combo.  Next time the only thing I will do differently is to maybe let it cook for just 2 or 3 minutes longer in hopes that it wil crisp up more.

This was great. I used bread flour instead of all purpose and shaped it on a cookie sheet. It raised extremely high. The herb flavour was light and I think next time I may add a bit more or try a different combination of flavours. This recipe will definitely be used over and over again at our home.

Awesome bread! I upped the amount of Parm, and made it in my bread machine. Next time, I'll let the machine do the kneading, then shape the loaf by hand. I could have eaten the whole thing in one sitting - delicious. Thanks so much,  Cathy!

I did not find this very good. I substituted 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour for the all purpose.  Don't know if that did it, but it was crumbly and lacked flavor.
