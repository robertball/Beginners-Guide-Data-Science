Love the cake.  I didn't make it with rasins or walnuts cause I didn't have any and instead of 1/2 cup shortening I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil. Didn't frost it at all.  The cake turned out moist the way I like it and my husband said it was very good also.  We have a few apple trees and I make homemade applesauce often and used that. I might add homemade apple butter with the applesauce sometime.

This recipe was a hit with my family. I served it to dinner guests and had to give out the recipe because they loved it so much. I changed a few things because I didn't have everything listed. I upped the cinn. to 1 tsp. and omitted the cloves, allspice, walnuts and raisins. I also added 2 eggs instead of one and used cinn. applesause because that's all I had on hand. I added about 4 fresh cubed macintosh apples and I didn't have the ingredients for the frosting so I coated the top with confectionary sugar. It was a big hit!!!
I am making another one today and I am planning on using the frosting this time. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Luv the recipe:-)  The cake is moist and yummy delicious!  Even my husband, who usually doesn't like fruit type cakes, liked it.  I opted to omit raisins & walnuts.  I used two eggs instead of one, used onl 1/4 tsp of cloves & more cinnamon. Also added 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.  I topped the cake with a glaze made of confectionary sugar & orange juice.  Absolutley delicious!

I give this 4 stars because I made some changes to the recipe. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and butter instead of shortening (just my preference).  I did not add nuts and raisins and I used store-bought white frosting. This was a delicious spiced cake - a big hit with the husband and 2-year-old!

I decided to make this cake because it most closely matched the type of cake I wanted.  I did make some changes which are significant and in my opinion, enhanced the flavor.  I used two eggs, substituted milk for water and butter for shortening.  I also used a tsp of vanilla.  I did add a tsp more of cinnamon and didn't have either cloves or allspice, so I used 1 tsp of apple pie seasoning - delish!  I also left out the raisins and nuts and substitued about 1.5 cups of finely diced Macintosh apples.  I dusted the top with powdered sugar and it was just perfect - without frosting.  Excellent basic cake recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing - it was very close to the cake I had recently in Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.

Awesome ! I followed the recipe, except I didn't have allspice so I put Ginger in instead?. THe cake is so good I couldn't bare to frost it, and take away from the great taste. will definatley add this to the recipes I hand down to the girls.    Also If you read the reviews the only time it didn't score 5 stars is when the changed it. LOL

Delicious cake! I had to use up some unopening applesauce and decided upon this recipe. I cut it in half using the servings calculator. I decided to bake this in a small jellyroll baking sheet rather than a cake pan. The size sheet I used was a 12" x 8.5" I baked at 325 for 13 minutes. The only tweaking of ingredients I did was add additional cinnamon to the recipe.

I made this for our St. Patrick's day party and it turned out great. Very moist and flavorful. I used food coloring to make a decorative shamrock and green trim on top.

This is a good cake.  I used whole wheat flour and unsweetened applesauce and brown sugar.  It could have used a little more spice.  It cooked in about 30 minutes - nowhere near the time specified.  I had the oven on the right temp, and I bake often, so I don't think there is anything wrong with the thermostat in m oven.  My advice - just check it early.

This is VERY close to a cake I've been making since I was in jr. hi (c. 1956!) and it's long been a family favorite. Couple of notes - chunky applesauce adds a little texture, chill the applesauce before stirring in the soda. Slows the action of the soda a bit until you've mixed all ingredients and it's about to do its job. It does fine without the egg or the water. Lastly, Penuche Icing goes very well with this cake.

Yummy! Very moist and flavorful. I did make some additions to suit my taste. I used butter flavored Crisco. The rest of the tweeks were: 1.5 tsp Cinnamon; 1/8 tsp Nutmeg; 1 tsp Ground Ginger; 1 tsp Vanilla Extract. I added 1 cup of diced fresh tart apples that are sprinkled with a bit of sugar & tossed with flour to coat before beating into the batter mixture. I added 1 cup of dried cranberries that were presoaked in warm water for 20 minutes, drained (reserving the soaking water to use as the water in the ingredients list but increasing the water up to 3/4 cup) and then toss in a sprinkle of flour before folding into batter. Added 1/4 cup of Olive Oil, and 3/4 cups chopped walnuts. Divided between 2 greased & floured 8" loaf pans. Sprinkled tops with Pure Granola cereal (granola without dried fruit or cereal bran flakes & grains). Pat granola lightly down into batter to help it to stick, and baked at 350 for 1 Hour 10 Minutes.  Delish!!

This cake is fabulous, moist, flavorful and a huge it with my family.  I baked it in  the 9 x 13 pan and never got the chance to frost it.  They ate it warm.  :)  The only thing I changed was adding some peeled apple chunks.  About 2 small apples worth.  I will be making this again.  It is a keeper.

I found this very bland and not very tasty at all. I wouldn't make it again. Sorry :) I'm glad I didn't waste cream cheese for the icing and made a brown sugar sauce instead.

My daughter requested an applesauce cake for her 4th birthday party. This recipe did not disappoint! I used vegetable oil instead od shortening and I did not make the cream cheese frosting. I didn't change anything else though and it was so moist and fluffy and had a lot of flavor! My daughter loved it and so did many of our party guests!

I tried this recipe and was disapointed.  First of all it seemed like it had too much salt and not enough sugar.  The frosting was runnie and made more that is needed for the cake.

I did not care for this recipe.  I thought I'd done something wrong as the cake never rose. The frosting was too sweet (why orange juice for an apple cake?).  I might try it again but would cut the applesauce down to 8 oz. or one cup and use milk instead of water.

I made this cake twice and it is wonderful!  I found that if you make it a day ahead of time it is alot moister the next day.  Actually it was moister the longer it sets.  It was the best apple cake I've ever had.  The only things I changed were:  I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, I used butter instead of the shortening, and I added an extra 1/2 cup of applesause instead of the water. I used two 8 inch cake pans for a layer cake.  I also had to use 2 extra cups of confectioner sugar to make the frosting a little firmer.  I then melted caramel and poured over the top and let it drip down the sides for an added touch and topped it with walnuts.  A huge hit with everyone!  I've been asked for this recipe several times!

I used all whole wheat flour and cut sugar in half. I have an abundance of applesauce so I used it instead of the water and shortening, for a total of 3 cups of applesauce. It took a lot longer to cook - about 60-70 min and was still sticky inside. It was not so good while still warm. I thought I would be tossing the recipe. BUT, the next day when totally cooled I cut a piece in half and put peanut butter on one side, jam on the other and made little sandwiches which we all thought were awesome, except for my 7 year old! I will definitely make again and use instead of bread.
