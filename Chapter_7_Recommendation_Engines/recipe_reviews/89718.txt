Definitely an odd assortment of ingredients. I gave it a try based on the other reviews but it's pretty bland. Okay but I won't make it again. I've never made a main course with a bag of potato chips as an ingredient. My husband called it white trash casserole.

The guys in my household really really liked this. They each had multipule mounded servings. I liked it too. I changed the mushroom soup to garlic cream of mushroom soup and added some chopped onion to it. I was afraid there wasn't gong to be enough spices but the flavoring on the chips really came through and they stayed crunchy. I had never bought frozen broccolli before and did not care for it to many stems. I prefer the crowns so next time I wil steam some fresh. This was very easy to make and it made alot. Great leftovers. I used a big dutch oven pot instead of the 9x13 so I would have a lid to put on the leftovers. This casserole will be a regular in my house.

My family loved this recipe and with five children that is saying a lot! Since I couldn't find ranch tortilla chips I used plain ones but put a dry package of ranch dressing in the sour cream/soup/milk mixture. Fabulous!

This tasted okay but needed more seasoning. A good recipe to try and modify to suit your tastes.

Odd mix of ingredients but I tried it anyway. I think it needs seasoning it was pretty bland. I will experiment and add onions and spices for the next time. But it is a keeper since it makes a big batch and we love leftovers.

We did not care for this recipe. The Ranch Doritos were WAY overpowering - and I even used less than recommended amount. The sauce would've been horribly bland but I did jazz it up (with gobs of spice white wine and some Cholula Hot Sauce). After a few tastes everyone pushed their plates aside and wouldn't finish dinner.

This recipe was very good and almost everyone liked it. The only person who did not was my extremely picky younger brother who liked all of the ingredients (except the broccoli) but thought that it was "wrong to put them all together". The only complaint I have is how salty it was. I don't know if that's because I used all our leftover bags of chips that were never going to be eaten or if it's supposed to be that way. But I used about half the recommended cheese in an effort to make up for the salt difference. I don't know but it was excellent and I will definitely make it again!

I tried this recipe to make something different for a change. My family enjoyed it. I think next time I will leave the brocolli out didn't care for that being in there much. But a very strange yet good recipe!!

I actually loved this dish but my family did not. It's not very healthy so I probably won't make it again. It's a fun recipe to try though.

The kids really liked it but it's a little bit better if you use cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom soup.

Once I read the review that called this "White Trash Casserole" I knew I had to try it! It was good. I of course had to change a few things due to the ingredients not being on hand but it was still delicious. I have had trashier casseroles but this was certainly comfort food at its finest. I used about 2 & 1/2 cups of cheese instead of all 4 which did not make it dry and still tasted cheesey. and only about 1/2 the bag of Doritos- mostly because it was late and the already starving kids kept eating them as I was cooking. I might try again with a better sauce with more flavor to try to liven it up. Maybe some green chilis would make it a 5 star? I'll let you know.

I'm going to blame the ranch chips. They took on a weird texture and gave an unusual flavor to the entire dish. The rest of the recipe is pretty good. I may try it again without the chips.

Crazy! my husband taught me this recipe from Robert! We use a bag of broccoli and a bag of cauliflower. I mix everything together - minus the chips and bake covered in foil. I add Doritos on top and cook for a little longer so they don't burn. So good!!!

I omitted the chips and added saut√©ed onions and mushrooms to the other ingredients. This made a very tasty soup this way. I will try it as a casserole the next time..

Wow Great stuff. The wife and I loved this recipe. One easy time saver; cut up the chicken before cooking saved having to wait for it to cool off. Will definitely make this one again.
