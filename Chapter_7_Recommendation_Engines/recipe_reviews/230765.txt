This was quite good!  I didn't have carob powder, so I used cocoa powder.  Could not taste avocado at all.  I don't know about 4 servings...I think I squeaked out two.

I love the fact that I can make a decant dessert that's really healthy and great tasting!  I made this a couple times first time by the receipt - it was good, but way to sweet. So the second time I switched out the water with unsweetened almond milk and a 1/3 cup of agave - smoother creamier taste - still way to sweet   There will be a next time and I'm keeping my other modifications and doing just a 1/4 cup of agave.  I would think that it his would be a difficulty pleasure ...., but I don't!   Keeper quick dessert!   Thanks!

I was surprised! Honestly I had my doubts, avocado? but in the end it was actually good! the avocado gives it the pudding consistency. I used unsweetened cocoa powder (I didn't have the other thing) and halved the agave, and it turned out great! would make again.

My kids loved this.  It was a little rich for me, which is good because I could eat a gallon of jello pudding, but only ate about 1/4 cup and was completely satisfied.

This is GREAT! Tastes exactly like "regular" pudding, even would have fooled me into thinking it was chocolate and not carob. I do not like agave nectar and so substited just 1/4 cup of maple syrup for it, it was plenty sweet.

Would be good with slices of banana and crushed nuts on top.

I loved this so much! I had everything except the powder so instead I used coco powder. I didn’t put the peppermint drops in either. When I made it like the recipe it had way too much agave for my liking and the ingredients tasted “unbalanced” so I added two (smaller sized) bananas... it was the best pudding I’ve ever had. I recommend!! (I also topped it if with some bananas and avocado but it won’t let me share my pictures:/ )
