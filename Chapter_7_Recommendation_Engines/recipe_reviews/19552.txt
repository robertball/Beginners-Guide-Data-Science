This stuffing recipe was sooooo yummy!  I wanted to prepare something different than the usual -- this was to be the first time having my family to my home for thanksgiving dinner.  People were making a meal out of the stuffing!!!  My mom just called and asked me to email her the recipe for Christmas dinner -- I think it went over well!  Thanks!!!

This stuffing is very yummy and a nice alternative for anyone who dislikes eggs like I do.  I usually pass on stuffing because of the eggs.  Great recipe, thanks.

This was the best stuffing my family ever had. We ate the entire pan at our Thanksgiving dinner.  It was sweet, but not too sweet. I substituted one cup of chesnuts for the water chesnuts and it turned out really tasty. Everyone demands that I make more of it for Christmas.

Wonderful! Tried my hand at homemade stuffing for the first time at Christmas and it was delicious. Even my 15 year old niece commented at the dinner table how good it was. I did use chicken broth instead of turkey broth and it turned out fine. I had to double the recipe, though. Doubling it made a 9x13 pan which was perfect.

I love this recipe. I have made it for the past 3 years with the addition of apple juice and a little more apple sauce it is perfect. I always get rave reviews.

This recipe is now my standard Thanksgiving Day stuffing.  It is delicious and moist.  I add golden delicious raisins and dried cranberries to it as well.  I always stuff the bird with it, but I am going to try it with the broth and bake it to use it all year long.  It's too yummy to just have on Thanksgiving only.

Was very delicious!!  I only used 1 apple, maybe even just 2/3rds of one.  This is very different but SOOOOOOO Yummy.  Everyone loved it.

I made this for picky eaters who will not eat onions or celery. I boiled the onions and celery for a while and then removed them from the butter. I didnt have turkey on hand so I made chicken stock out of "better then boullion."  It was packed with flavor.

I did not like this stuffing at all.  It tasted like wet bread.  It was very bland.  I would not make it again.

This will be the 3rd or 4th  Thanksgiving making this recipe. I  bought stove top  stuffing a week ago, and my husband said no way, he wanted this stuffing. I thought maybe he wouldnt care, and I could get away with the easy box thing and just add apples lol but he said nope. Guess this is what we will be eating for years to come.....wow, its 2016 and I did this same thing again, I just took back 2 boxes of stove top. Crazy!!

Thank you!  This is the closest I've come to finding a recipe resembling my mom's traditional dressing (that's what we call it!) since she passed away.  I make a few variations, because these are ingredients I know she used...I add 1/4 c. apple juice and 1/4 c. prune or pomegranate juice.  Her dressy was pretty 'wet' and these add a nice flavor.  Raisins and/or craisins are a must.
