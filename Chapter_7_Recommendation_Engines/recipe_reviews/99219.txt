It didnt taste like the sauce i get at the sushi bar, so i tweaked it. I used 1/2 cup of mayo, 1 tablespoon of sriracha chili sauce, 1 tsp of seseme oil, 1 tsp cayenne pepper. 

perfect.

Every time I make sushi, I try to get a spicy mayo to work in our dynamite rolls...it's never quite right.  I tried this recipe, and while the flavor is right with the chili-garlic sauce and sugar, the proportions just weren't right for me.  Dynamite Sauce usually has a good kick of spice and to get that I had to add 4 times the amount of chili-garlic sauce that this recipe called for.

This stuff is great, and so versatile. It's too hot for me (I buy my garlic chili sauce from the local Thai grocery, and it is VERY spicy), but Husband uses it as a dip for chips, fries and egg rolls, and even as a topping in tacos and burgers. I make up a large batch, and keep it refrigerated until needed. Thanks, The Sushi Guy!

DYNAMITE!! This dip is awesome, really spicy but awesome. I used it to dip my porkchops in, sounds weird but it was really good. I was out of the chili garlic sauce so I used the rooster sauce and added jarred minced garlic to it. YUMMY! This will be good on a lot of things!

This was great - we added in more chili garlic sauce, as well as some red pepper, and served with the marinated grilled shrimp from this site, as an appetizer at our bbq. Thanks!

Wonderful stuff. Spicy sweet and creamy. I used this as a sandwich spread for my own "Southwest sandwich" which is smoked turkey, crispy bacon, jalapeno jack cheese, sliced ripe avocado, and shredded lettuce, and "southwest mayo" which is this case is called "dynamite sauce". This was perfect for what I wanted to use it for. I scaled this down to only make what I needed for immediate needs. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy! It tasted great with sushi, it reminds me of the sauce we get up here with our fisherman roll.

So good! Not quite like the "Spicy Mayo" I love on certain sushi rolls at restaurants, but it was still really yummy and I will definitely be using it quite often from now on! Incredibly easy to make as well!

If you want to tweak this, add onion, radish, ginger, and carrots chopped to oblivion in the processor.. Add the mayo and rooster sauce..

this is AWESOME SAUCE.  Use this on just about anything, from eggs to fish, meat, and any number of dishes.  keep a container of it in my fridge at all times.  feel free to add more hot pepper sauce if you wish to get your desired heat.

This was very good! Took some of the suggestions from other comments and made a great crab salad and served on crackers.  To the recipe I added imitation crab meat, tsp. sesame oil,cayenne pepper and it was really good.  A new little spicey crab salad!!

Okay, we love this sauce. The first few times I made it, I made it as is and served it immediately and it really was DYNAMITE. My hubby and I both stood in our kitchen eating crinkle fries with this sauce and finished them off before we even had the burgers plated! I have since made a few tiny changes and have found that it's best when you refrigerate it for at least 12 hours before serving. It's also much tastier, when served as a dip, if it's very cold (could just be a personal preference, as my husband loves it either way.) I've adjusted the sugar/sriracha ratio, but that's only ever been to allow those in my family that dislike the heat to enjoy it. It's delicious on burgers and fries, shrimp, crab/salmon cakes, we've even used it as a salad dressing (thinned out with 2 tbs milk) and it's just SO darn tasty. Thanks for sharing your recipe, it's a favorite in our home!

I used lite mayo, pink packet sweetener, and sambal in the same portions and we love the flavor of the lower fat and calorie sauce so much I make it with every sushi dinner.

Simple and great, exactly what they serve in the sushi restaurants. I will never buy it again. Thanks for the great recipe.
