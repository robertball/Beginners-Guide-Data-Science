Absolutely delicious. Didn't make any changes. Can't understand the one person who didn't make the dish, but rated it with 1 star due to calorie count. If you are not going to make the dish because of that, why even rate it at all? Not completely fair, in my opinion.

Since I'm a vegetarian, I substituted firm tofu for the chicken. I cooked the tofu per instructions but didn't add it back to the pot with the stock until almost ready for serving.  Also, I used coconut milk and cut the stock down by 12 oz.  Didn't have zucchini; used fresh green beans instead as well as 1 cup pumpkin puree to firm it up.  Didn't have fresh peanuts or cilantro but it didn't matter.  Served the stew over cooked spaghetti squash.  It was filling and delicious.

This recipe was so great. Husband and I devoured it. May skip the sugar next time, ketchup was sweet enough. Used red chilies and added an extra bell pepper. Recipe is definitely going to be added to our regular rotation.

Delicious! Well worth the time it took. I did, however, make some calorie-saving changes. No sugar, half the oil (used coconut), no garnish peanuts, no poblano, and changed to brown rice = 750 calories rather than the 1138. The even better news: The servings on this dish are HUGE. I ate half a serving and am full (although, I might have seconds because it's so stinkin good). Chef John is quickly becoming my go to for new recipes!

As a huge fan of Chef John, I'm always willing to try a recipe he posts. This one, while certainly good, wasn't a big hit here. I was actually very surprised, (given the ingredients), that this wasn't more flavorful. Since it's from Chef John, I'll try making it again before deleting it from my favorites, but may make a few adjustments to spice things up.

Yummy! Wonderful smell and taste. Love it! Recipe made a lot so enjoyed leftovers  the next day. Be sure to prep all ingredients before starting because I did not and spent too much time running around the kitchen looking for tools with which to cut and chop. Lesson learned lol :)  Served with Basmati rice and salad.

I did make some changes and will make even more next time.  I left out the zucchini for fear it would get too soft, especially if reheating leftovers.  We didn't miss it at all, but next time may use more bell pepper to make up for this.  Also subbed Heinz Chili Sauce for catsup, as I prefer it to catsup.  Also cut the sugar in half, and next time may leave it out altogether.  Added a bit of lemongrass, for a more authentic flavor.  Also added some red chili (the kind from a tube) as we like our food spicy.  May add more red chili next time. And finally, instead of using it as a garnish, I added the chopped cilantro for the last two minutes of cooking, and used a bit more than called for.  It is a good starting recipe that can be fine-tuned to suit personal preferences.  Thanks, Chef John.

Excellent! Made with chicken breast to reduce fat and was still tender and delicious. My wife and nine year old son loved it so this will be a regular addition our meal planning options.

Really loved this. Used conventional crunchy peanut butter, so skipped adding in the brown sugar and peanuts. Was really great, will make again.

We loved this!  The only change that I made was with the chicken broth.  I substituted 3/4 c. unsweetened coconut milk.  Everything else the same and it was phenomenal.  I added green pepper, chopped carrots and broccoli to the veggie portion.  Served just as pictured....in a bowl, topped with some rice.  This is my new favorite.  Oh and I didn't even have the pobalano pepper and it was still fantastic!!!

We love this recipe.  I did substitute paprika for the cayenne pepper just because I didn't want the heat.  It makes a lot, so I can freeze half.  It will be on our menu cycle often!

This and the Chicken Tikka Masala recipe are to die for! This dish reminds of my Thai curry and its delicious! Next time I'll even try using firm tofu because the curry is so rich and creamy that would give tofu a lot more flavour. A must try!

This recipewas waaaay too salty for me, but otherwise very nice. Next time I will leave out all of the salt. I will get enough salt from the peanut butter, the ketchup and the broth -  in addition to the other ingredients which already contain salt. 

Other than that, the recipe is very good.

Great recipe! But mine came out really really salty! I used normal salt as oppose to "kosher" salt so not sure if kosher salt is less salty. Had to throw in some sweet potato to take  some of the saltiness away. Will try next time with half a tablespoon of salt, maybe even less.... 
Thanks for the great idea....

I made this on Friday night for dinner.  My husband called up from the basement and asked what was for dinner and I told him curry.  He said he didn't feel like curry.  Boy, did he change his mind when we ate it!   I didn't have just turmeric so I added curry powder instead and I bumped up the cayenne to 1 tsp.  It's still not hot, even with those additions but does have a nice, mellow after-glow.   The flavours are fantastic in this dish and I would highly recommend it.  I will be making it often!

I don't even like peanut butter, but this was great. I didn't have any zucchini, but had some cauliflower that I needed to use. I also subbed thee jalapenos for a poblano pepper  and added red pepper flakes. (we like spice). Many thanks to Chef John for his great chicken recipes.  I've made many of them and they are easy to prepare, budget friendly, and delicious.

Good, though I made some changes. Made half recipe using 2 chicken breasts. Used ingredients as stated except no salt, less cayenne and didn't use any veggies except the onion. Could maybe use a little less peanut butter- it seemed to overpower the other flavors (but it would have been different if I had used the veggies).

My friends and I made this as our first "family dinner" together and loved it! We added a bit more Cayenne pepper and halved the poblanos and loved it. Also, we added a few of the poblanos earlier in order to really get some good spice from them. Very delicious, we will definitely be keeping this one around!

I'm a total novice, but by watching the video and "going with the flow", this dish turned out so amazing! Flavorful and delicious!

So, don't waffle or hesitate - have confidence in yourself.  You can do it, so jump in and give this recipe a try!

Comments from an amateur:
1. Used 1/2 TSP Paprika - 1/2 TSP HOT Hungarian Paprika;
2. Stuck to the recipe/process like glue;
3. Used chicken STOCK (vs broth) - sauce thickened nicely;
4. Went the 'natural' peanut butter/light brown sugar route;
5. Final product had a slight kick, but passed the 'mother-in-law' test for favor!

Declared total victory and rewarded myself with another margarita......

It was fantastic. The dish is not salty if you follow Chef Johns recipe. Coarse Kosher salt is nowhere near as salty as iodized salt. use half salt if you do not have Kosher on hand. The inspiration to make this dish came when i opened the fridge last night to find one lonely shriveled up lime begging for one last chance to be used. I literally made this dish so that darn lime didn't go to waste. Am I nuts? I made one small addition to the ingredients only because I am fortunate to have an abundance of fresh Thai Basil growing in my backyard so i chopped up about 2 TBS of thai basil and threw it in at the end with the other tender veg. I used natural P-butter but not unsweetened, taste testing mid way left me saying ADD THE BROWN SUGAR. I did. That little bit of sugar made the difference in my opinion.

Wowza. I can't believe this is so good - and actually has some sort of authentic flavor. Authentic to whom, I'm unsure...but it's good and different. I was looking to change things up and this hit the spot. While the idea of PB is odd, it works in the most incredible way; it adds an undernote of  flavor but is actually not the star of the dish (the spices are), but where it really shines is the creaminess it brings. I used regular Peter Pan PB and didn't add any sugar. It is perfect. Don't forgo the lime though! I'd say it's critical to cutting through the creaminess so you can experience all the flavors individually.

What a great way to use up peanuts! Even the peanut butter I made from using extra peanuts I had on hand. Chef John did it again - I can’t believe that the kids ate all this.  This is the only recipe that will have the kids eat up turmeric, zucchini and other veggies. I have to warn you though that this recipe took double the time. In the future I’m going to chop up all the ingredients ahead of time. I’m also going to cook the chicken and veggies for only 10-15 minutes, because the chicken at the was a bit rubbery and over cooked. Will definitely make it again!

Really interesting, flavorful dish, but very heavy on the prep (I'm admittedly a slow prep cook, but I think 15 minutes is a low estimate in general). I thought it was tasty, but I wonder if maybe I overcooked it a little? I did like the spice level and the heartiness of the meal. I don't think it's going to be top of my list as far as curries go, though.

Everyone in my family loved this dish. We served it with basmati rice and a cut up melon.

5/18 How can food I didn't grow up with be so comforting? Start early with all the prep. I used pork instead of chicken, and a ziploc bag to coat the meat with spice. Cut meat smaller next time for E. I used 2 carrots, 4 medium potatoes, 1 cucumber, store brand crunchy peanut butter.  I skipped both peppers and the brown sugar. The larger 90°-side skillet was perfect. The burner was on for an hour, but that includes browning the meat, onions, etc. It didn't need to simmer for an hour. DH, T, and I loved, A and E liked.
6/18 update: I accidently added all the spice to the meat instead of keeping some back for later. Same additions and subtractions as above but added more PB and subbed 1 can coconut milk for chicken broth. No discernable difference, oh so good!

Guess what!?  I FOLLOWED the directions without any modifications whatsoever and it was fantastic AS IS!  My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe but now that we tried it AS IT WAS DESIGNED, we'll set about making our own modification.  Chef John, you done good!!

I made revisions from other reviews to be honest. I hate when reviewers make revisions and give lower ratings, but here I go. I added the coconut milk. I added tomato paste instead of ketchup. I used cauliflower instead of zucchini. I cut back on the salt. And I did think it was a little bland when comparing to what I might get in a restaurant. I felt guilty (calorie wise) with all that peanut butter. I also felt like it was missing something- maybe the ketchup would have helped?  My Thai place has great curry and no clean up- so that would be preferred, but my husband did enjoy it.

This  recipe grew on me. I decreased the chicken broth to 2 cups, the peanut butter to 2/3 and added some splashes of lime juice directly to the simmering mixture.

Oh my gosh!!  I like all of Chef Johns recipes but this was exceptional.  Probably my favorite of his so far.  I did change slightly but nothing to change the excellent flavor.  I just doubled the cayenne and peanuts.  This recipe is restaurant quality.

Used chicken breasts and followed recipe exactly as written. Thought this was very good and almost 5 stars, except that zucchini was indeed over cooked after 45 minutes so would add it later. Might also use an added green pepper to the mix!

The ketchup tasted out of balance in relation with the overall taste. I would recommend substituting tomato paste for the ketchup. Otherwise, everything went well.

Oh my, this was delicious.  I get so annoyed when recipes are rated and reviewed with multiple changes but I'm somewhat guilty of doing the same for this recipe.  Only changes I made was using chicken breasts vs. thighs, and broccoli in place of zucchini.  It was fabulous and any recipe from Chef John is always outstanding.  Thank you, definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe almost as written except for the poblano pepper, which I didn't have. So I had to add more of the  other spices to compensate.  I put in the whole 4 cup container of chicken broth because I  was adding more veggies (carrots, sweet potatoes and white potatoes). There was plenty of sauce, and everyone really liked it.  The recipe didn't say to cover while simmering, so I didn't. That is when the sauce really thickened up nicely.

This was absolutely amazing! Chef John rarely disappoints and I think this is one of the best recipes from him I’ve made yet. I added a bit more cayenne and I think next time I’ll add a bit more veggies (and probably add them closer to the end so they don’t get as soft) but the flavor profile was phenomenal!

I liked it. I thought that the peanut butter kind of masked the flavours of the spices, so I hit it pretty hard with cayenne pepper and another round of spices of the recipe. Didn't have all the veggies that I needed, so roasted some sweet potato chunks and threw them in at the end. Thank you for all your effort and time. You really help me.

Great Tasting dish and as long as you prep all the ingredients easy to tackle for a dinner party. I followed the recipe to the letter initially and made changes on my second attempt. I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and added more cayenne, 3/4 teaspoon total and another red pepper. Instead of ketchup I used Red Thai Curry paste, about 1 Tablespoon. I left out the sugar and topped the dish with spring onions instead of peanuts. It was excellent and will be stay in my “Keeper Files”. I served with toasted sourdough bread, and arugula salad.

Pretty good! I substituted some of the ingredients that I didn’t have like poblano peppers and I didn’t have unsweetened peanut butter but still really enjoyed the dish. Will definitely make again.

Another winner, so long as you remember to squirt the lime garnish on it before you eat... the acid cuts through the peanut butter. I added fish sauce, just because.

I like the fact that Chef John did not use coconut milk as, I too, think it would be too sweet.  I was also concerned about the salt, fat and sugar content of the recipe, so I made the following changes:
1 teaspoon of salt in the seasoning
used low fat/low salt chicken broth,
used tomato paste instead of ketchup
no brown sugar.

It was excellent!  I will definitely make this again.
Thank you!

Not over salted at 1 tablespoon.  Plenty spicy for normal folks. I used boneless chicken breasts sliced into narrow strips.  I sautéed as directed. I added an additional 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne which made it nicely spicy.  I also added an additional 1/2 cup of crunch peanut butter, a 1/4 cup of coconut milk and 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  This helped to make it a bit more creamy and cut the heat of the cayenne for my guests.  Very nice, complex flavor profile.  Well done!!

Absolutely amazing! My husband and I love this recipe.  I’ve made it four times in the past two months, we can’t get enough. I personally increase the spice due to personal preference. I totally recommend giving this recipe a go!

Absolutely delicious and typical of Chef John's awesome recipes. My daughter moaned when I said it has chicken with peanuts ("doesn't taste right in my mouth":), but she LOVED it. My husband was still making yum noises after he finished his. 

The only thing I changed is no poblano peppers since I can't eat them, but it still had some nice heat from the cayenne. I agree with someone that I'll use less broth next time, but really agreed with another reviewer that the time it takes is cut in half because you have another full meal for four! :) Well worth the time.  The cilantro and lime juice really cinched the delicious meal.

Excellent recipe!  Yes, get your prep work done ahead of time, but other than that, most of the time is spent braising, and the meal is so worth it in the end. FIVE STARS.

Tastes good, but not spicy enough and doesn't have that curry flavor I was looking for. For the time it takes to make, wont make it again.

I followed the directions to the letter, with the exception of the poblano pepper.  I couldn't find poblano peppers, so I substituted a jalapeno pepper, but otherwise, absolutely no changes.  This came out GREAT!  I was kind of nervous about the peanut butter and ketchup combination, and as with all things new, worried the flavors would be off-putting to my family, but it got rave reviews.  The dash of lime brightens up the earthy tones of this dish.  Love it!

I made this recipie with a few changes, and loved the way it turned out. First, I subsituted the chicken thigh for chicken breast, I am not a fan of chicken thigh texture. I added the full amount of chicken broth and found it to be too watery, I am not a fan of watery curries and usually request mine be made thicker when I go to restaurants. I added a bit of coconut milk/heavy whipping cream and corn starch to thicken it up. Next time I will try it with less chicken broth.

So. Freaking. Good.
I made it for my family and they all loved it! I didn’t include the peppers and I replaced the onions and garlic with their powdered forms. I was so surprised that I liked it. Who knew peanut butter tastes great with chicken?

So so good!  A couple of notations: it makes a lot. If there is just 2 of you then cut recipe in half at least. Second, I used the recommended 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and it was not even remotely spicy. If you like it spicy then up that ingredient. Other than that enjoy!

It was great! I prefer it to be a bit hotter so next time I'll add more pepper flakes. The focus on vegies is a very nice touch to the traditional.

I made this twice; once for a regular family dinner and again for a recent birthday party,  Scaling it to feed 30+ was easy thanks to the serving counter.  I did add unsweetened coconut milk  the second time and they all LOVED it!  Thanks, Chef john!

This is by far the most popular thing I've cooked. My husband can't stop saying how amazing it tastes. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of (1) making much more rice and (2) using thinly sliced chicken breast (that I cut up into 2-inch strips). Overall this recipe is amazing. Will definitely make again.

This is a VERY forgiving receipe. It can handle substitutions. When it was all done, I popped it into my crockpot to keep it warm as people got home at different times. The flavor was very good, a nice mild curry.

This was really a hit at my house!  It makes quite a lot though and is pretty high calorie, but so delicious!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders in place of the thighs and half the sugar called for.  No complaints from my hubby about eating it for more than one meal!

Very flavourful! Will definitely make this again. The changes I made were to cut way down on the salt and also instead of buying  zucchini, I used up some snow peas & shredded carrots . Next time I will cut down a bit on the broth. So good!

This is wonderful!  Changes:  I subbed a can of unsweetened coconut milk for part of the chicken broth; used Jiff creamy peanut butter, skipped the brown sugar;  and because I didn't had 1.5 lbs of chicken, added carrots and broccoli to make up the difference.  It wasn't difficult to put together at all, and I'm looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow.

This was delicious!  I made it just as presented. I would describe the sauce as a combination of Thai yellow curry and peanut sauce.  It had  just the right pizazz  of spiciness for a mild yellow curry.   You could always add more cayenne if you like it spicier. This will replace a substandard yellow curry recipe I tried previously. I get past the labor intensiveness of the recipe by doubling it  (which for us would be for 4) and enjoying not  having to cook on another night! That cuts the prep time in half :-)  Also, I usually prefer chicken breasts, but this is a dish where I definitely enjoyed the pleasure of dark meat, which pleased my husband tremendously since it is his favorite and I hardly ever make it!  This is a keeper for us :-)

Lovely flavors. I used chicken breasts  instead of dark meat and it was tender and yummy. I forgot to buy ginger so used powdered, adding it to spice blend. This was a success and around.

The chicken seemed a bit bland (should have let it soak in more,) but the sauce was delightful.  We made Jasmine rice with coconut milk and chicken stock. Add naan and enjoy

Oh my goodness - this is an awesome recipe. We followed the recipe as written, but added some diced carrots and broccoli florets around the 18 minute point of the 30 minute simmer. (we love vegetables!). This will definitely be on the menu again - thank you, Chef John

I used carrots, red bell pepper, yellow pattypans and baby eggplant. I roasted the veggies (except the carrots) to increase the flavour intensity and reduce the moisture from the veggies. I used chicken breast instead and in place of the chicken broth I used a Knorr stock pot and a tin of coconut cream (didn't have coconut milk). Very tasty

Never going to buy satay in a restaurant again!  This was sooo good, I have tried to make a good satay in the past and never found anything I liked.  This was amazing!  And has a good spice kick to it too which we loved. Only thing I changed was I cooked it a lot less time than the recipe after adding the chicken.  Will be making again!  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

This is without a doubt the best meal I've ever made and one of the best I've ever eaten. No one in my family was impressed when I said I was making curry chicken for supper but everyone loved this  meal. The only change I made was up add a bit of sriracha to increase the heat.

Amazing. I believe the phrase my boyfriend used to describe it was "restaurant good". The only change I made was to use serrano peppers and it was perfect. This will be on solid rotation.

Thankfully, I now have Chef John in my head saying, "Is your sauce getting too thick and your chicken isn't done? Add some more stock!" It really is that simple...why don't other food pros point this out!? 

I think I've gone to the Chef John Institute for the Culinary Arts. He may be the sole reason I can now cook. Without his technique videos, I'd be totally clueless in the kitchen.Thank you, Chef John!!!

This recipe is so delicious. I love it. The chicken is to tender and wonderfully seasoned. The sauce is thick and flavorful. I didn't change anything and I watched the video, which was helpful, particularly in how to cook the meat. I also love that this gives another way of using zucchini; I've had so many this season!

I made this on Monday and it was very good. Even my teenage son ate it and said it was very good. I made it as shown with a couple of modifications: I did add one can of coconut milk; I used potatoes and carrots to be sure my husband eats it; and I used a very large pan so I didn't have to cook the chicken in batches. However, that large surface area made the curry need 1.5 l of chicken broth! Will include in the rotation!

This made a LOT so make sure to use a pot big enough. I had to saute the vegetables separately because I didn't think they would fit and I liked the flavor this gave them - I think they would have gotten too mushy had I simmered for the 30 minutes required. While this was good, I feel that I've had other peanut sauce recipes that are better and didn't require as much time. If I make this again, I need to add a small element of heat.

Using the recipe's 1 Tbsp of salt would have made this inedible. I cut it to 1 tsp, and it was still on the verge of being too salty. Start with 1/2 tsp and add more as desired. Taste (as modified) was great; served with long-grain brown rice.

This dish was absolutely delicious, enjoyed by everyone who ate it.  The recipe as printed will feed 8 people.  I’m a 64-yo male who has always enjoyed cooking as long as I have a recipe to follow.  I easily made this by myself, omitting only the coriander because I didn’t have any.  I also added yellow and orange peppers for more color.  I will definitely make this again.

So good, I had to make an allrecipes account and post this review. 

So flavourful and well-rounded. The chicken was outrageously tender! Very hearty and satisfying.

I added some peanuts to the top after cooking for texture contrast. The lime is non-optional: it elevates everything. 

I originally thought I'd add coconut milk, even though CJ said it was rich enough without it. "Don't tell me what to do, chef John," I said. Boy, was he right. 

I made everything as listed. Only change was when I realized I'd run out of coriander.... So I used a curry spice blend that had it and cumin.  

Thank you, Chef!

Everyone in the family love this. Only change I made was that I didn’t have the poblano pepper so used a few slices of jalapeño with the seeds taken out and instead of zucchini I use fresh green beans because I didn’t have the zucchini. It turned out awesome and I like my rice served on the side so that I can add it as needed. But those are just my preference is the recipe is perfect as is

Oh my goodness, this was to die for!  I substituted coconut milk for half of the chicken broth as others suggested but otherwise made exactly as is. Oh yah, I only made one serving and there was enough for two of us with leftovers. Make sure you serve with some naan.

Sooooo good! I did want to make this lower calorie so I made quite a few changes but nothing that changed the recipe itself. But incase others are interested... 

I used chicken breast instead of thighs and cooked them in just 1 teaspoon oil. 

Then instead of peanut butter, I used PB2 (basically powdered peanut butter that’s only 40 calories per 2T). I didn’t need the extra sugar either. And only used 1/4 cup peanuts instead of 1/2 cup. 

With those changes, this went from the original 1100 calories to just 375 calories. And it was so delicious!

Oh, also! Some people complained about the salt and I don’t think it needs as much salt as was called for. I only used 1 teaspoon. There’s plenty more coming from the broth and peanut butter.

We made two changes because we didn't have the exact ingredients.  We used boneless skinless chicken breasts and asparagus.   It was a little spicy for our taste so we added a dollop of greek yogurt to cut the heat.  Both substitutions were ok, but will use thighs and zucchini next time.  And there will be a next time!

Crazy delicious.  Even the family members who claimed to be non-believers in peanut sauces loved this.  But come now, Chef John.  A 15-minute prep time?  You're saying that you mix up the spice blend, cube the chicken, chop the onion, mince the garlic, cube the zucchini and pepper, grate the ginger, dice the poblano pepper, and (what else?) in 15 minutes time?

Outrageously delicious! I am unfamiliar with poblano so I was afraid to use it. Used one little chipotle pepper instead. Cooked it in the instant pot and it was SPECTACULAR! Not too salty, not too hot, not too peanutty. Just PERFECT.

I LOVE being able to count on Chef John to help me succeed in the kitchen. You are a very special person, CJ, and I am so grateful for you.  And your crab cakes which also rock. But mostly for YOU!

I made this and loved it. I already had some all natural peanut butter, although it had small amount of sugar in it, I used this and didn’t add the 1 Tablespoon of sugar recipe called for. The recipe was so easy to follow and the spices worked very well. Will definitely make again and again.

I love Chef John’s recipes! I would consider myself an average cook, but this recipe makes me feel super fancy when I make it. So rich with layers of delicious spices. It takes some time, but it’s well worth it.

This was absolutely delicious!!!  It was a little different from ordinary chicken, easy to prepare and the end result was just perfect.    I did make one mistake - I cut the chicken pieces a bit too small.    Next time I will make them larger.     Soooo good!!

This recipe takes quite a bit of time and I underestimated how much time so I had to rush a few steps in order to get dinner on the table at a reasonable time. But boy! Was it worth the wait.  Very nice flavor.  And it made a ton for being only 4 servings. Way more than hubby and I can eat in one sitting so hoping I can freeze it for dinner another time. Not sure about the zucchini since it got pretty well done from 30 minutes of simmering but we'll see.  Another hit for Chef John. Thanks!

I made a LOT of tweaks to this recipe, as it tasted bland to my palate.  I would double the spices and peppers next time.

I have learned to watch the videos before making the recipes because it helps to get some tips that are not included in the directions and I like to see the size of the diced veggies, plus chef John is so entertaining! This was delicious. I made minor changes based on personal preference...no zucchini, but added an extra red pepper, 2 thinly sliced carrots, 1 jalapeño, and a heaping spoonful of red chili paste (we love it spicy). Followed other ingredients and cooking instructions as directed. As chef John warned, it was adictive and we totally stuffed ourselves.

The only thing I did different was not to add the peanuts.  I didn't have any.  My husband just asked for me to make it again for tomorrow.  I will add the peanuts this time.  This is the best curry ever!!!

This is a favorite, great flavor.

The second time around I doubled the dry spice quantity,   added all veggies at the first step (omitting the zucchini) and reduced the simmer time by half the time. 

For veggies, I substituted based on preference and freeze-ability - with onion, red & green bell, poblano pepper, carrots & pineapple chunks.  

I browned the chicken on medium high, not high - to save the heavy smoke-filled house experience. 

I added coconut milk at the end to cut the heat (I doubled the spice quantity)and didn't find it to be sweet at all - the pineapple gave it great acidity and brightness & the coconut milk cut the heat and added a creaminess I think it wanted -
 great balance of flavors.  

My partner, who isn't known for enjoying non-american cuisine, said the second version was one of the best meals he's ever eaten. Of course, he loves pineapples, partly why I chose that as an addition.  

Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe very closely but not exactly.  I had a bit more chicken and zucchini than the recipe called for so I put the extra in.  My peanut butter was regular sweetened peanut butter.  I don't think these alterations changed the outcome.  It was absolutely delicious!  This makes way more than 4 servings.  Plan to get at least 8 servings out of it.  This recipe is a keeper.  I'm having guests over this weekend and will make this again.

Thanks to Chef John. Another 10 star dish. I saw people’s comments can replace chicken with Tofu. I tried 2 extra firm Tofu, the dish turned out great.

Had to try this recipe out, and I thought it was quite delicious.  I didn't quite follow the recipe exactly, as I had to convert it to vegetarian-friendly. I substituted vegetable broth, and replaced the chicken with cubed tofu. (which I browned up early on, then threw back in with about 10 minutes left in the final simmer).  In addition, I missed the paprika (empty jar in the pantry), and the pablano pepper - there wasn't any at the store where I shop regularly.  Regardless, it was tasty, filling, and I have plenty for leftovers. One day I'll have to try it with chicken, but not when I have to feed my wife as well ;-)

Very good!!  We didn't add in any peppers as I had an abundance of zucchini, but the rest of it was delicious as posted.  Loved that the peanut butter wasn't overpowering - just a nice subtle flavor and a little spice in each bite.  Great recipe - can't go wrong with Chef John!

Outstanding curry! I have to say, delicious! I really couldn't follow the amounts exactly, since I didn't have that much of chicken, so I used the amount of spices as close as I could...except for the coriander, with my toddler running around, didn't have time to grind it, so I left it out.  I'll try to use it next time and see how it enhances the already delightful flavor of this curry =)

Keeping this recipe for sure!

I cook enough for several meals for the week.  With every day, this dish got better and better. The chicken marinated longer  making the dish all the better.  Next time I'd add  more ginger.

Substituted coriander with fresh cilantro. It was very good. Personally, I don't like spicy food so much, so I could have done with more peanut butter and a tad less spice, but my husband said it was perfect (he loves the spice). We both really liked it!

I halved the salt, added a little coconut milk that I needed to use up, added a jalapeno instead of the cayenne, and leftover chicken...otherwise followed the recipe like said and it was delicious! This could really take any veggies you have and need to use up. It is a winner! Thank you :)

I made this following the recipe exactly except (per suggestions made on previous reviews) I left out the brown sugar entirely and substituted the poblano pepper for a green bell pepper. I simply couldn't find any but while I like spicy food my six year old does not. Without the added spice of the poblano, he loved this dish. He even helped me make it! I served it over brown rice but actually prefer it alone with pieces of pita bread for dipping.

Really good!  I was missing one of the spices, added red pepper flakes instead, was still awesome.   Some suggested it may be too salty, I used low sodium chicken broth and did not find it too salty at all, so maybe try that if you're nervous about the saltiness.  I also used "normal" peanut butter (just normal skippy or something like that) so I skipped the sugar.  The veggies were great, could probably add any you had and they would be tasty.

Really good! We added less meat, since my hubby doesn't eat chunks of meat. In the end I used completely natural peanut butter (literally just roasted peanuts ground up -- no added oil, sugar, salt, etc).  For lack of peanuts, I used almond batons. I candied them in a pan which gave a scrummy crunchy garnish. Next time I will make a larger batch -- we loved this so much, it doesn't leave much for left overs to take to work!

I didn't have quite enough turmeric, so I added in some curry powder, otherwise I stuck to the recipe. I made a big batch and then froze the leftovers, it was just as good the second time around.

I used only half the salt as some of the other reviewers had said it was too salty. I also added more of all the spices and added some hot madras curry as I like a stronger flavor profile. Also used half sugar ketchup and brown sugar splenda as we are watching our sugar intake. Everything was kept the same. Delish!!!

Great recipe.  My kids really enjoyed it.  I did make one change as 1 of my children does not like peanut butter but will eat cashew butter, go figure.  So I replaced the peanut butter with cashew butter and the peanuts with pistachios

Made this recipe and my wife was quite happy with the result.  I did make a few changes, however:  I added 3 stalks of diced celery, 1 diced apple, and 3 diced carrots to kick up the veggie content.  Turned out great!

Delicious!  Didn't add the sugar or salt.  Diced 1 yam and 1 carrot, cooked in small amount of water in microwave, 3 minutes.  Added with red pepper at the end.  Used about 3 cups broth.  Served over brown jasmine rice.  Husband and I both loved this.  A keeper.

It was ok.... kind of bland. However, maybe I am just used to real Thai peanut dishes and more flavorful curries. This seemed like a watered down and generic version for most Americans? Edible but it didn't knock my socks off.

This is a great dish!  I used chicken breast (preference) and didn't have a zucchini on hand, but it still turned out super yummy.  Hot chilli paste can be substituted for the poblano pepper.  I'll definitely be making this again and may try adding sweet potato, as some other reviewers suggested.

I made this for my husband (I am not a peanut fan). He says it's delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. The only problem I had was the prep time: 15 minutes. Well, I'm not a chef, so maybe that's why it took me the good part of an hour to get everything prepped and ready to cook.  Update: I say I'm not a peanut fan, but I came home starving and this was leftover in the fridge. OMGoodness! Delicious! Served over brown rice.

I bumped up the salt a bit and cumin and tumeric and black pepper. Also added red curry paste to give it a little more pow.  Taste great. But what made it AMAZING is a squeeze of lemon on top.  That was what made the dish spectacular. U would never believe that lemon would seal the deal but dont leave this ingredient out. Trust me.

The zucchini is the absolute star ingredient in this recipe. Instead of chunks, I slice them consistently at 3/4" and add a little extra if I have it. If simmered at the right temperature (slightly below medium with my stove/pot combo), they come out with a lovely texture. I see a lot of people who said they skipped out on the zucchini or used a substitute. If your instinct is to do so, please try the recipe as written first (with natural peanut butter). I promise it's worth it. The chicken is impossible to mess up, though I've found that it comes out most tender when I simmer it with the vegetables for the full 40 minutes. The spice level is fairly low. I'm planning on throwing in a serrano on top of the poblano next time to see how it does with a little kick. This recipe is a bit time consuming overall but very worth it.

I have one vegetarian in the household who doesn't particularly like tofu, so I made a batch for them using a can of... chick peas... as a substitute for the chicken. If you decide to try this, you will need extra broth (and probably veg instead of chicken) as it gets very thick. I can't say I like it that much (I find the oil from the chick peas adds an undesirable flavor to the mix and the lack of chicken broth is another strike), but my vegetarian said she loved it so I thought I would make mention of the modification. Personally, I'd give it 3/5 with this mod, but it's all subjective anyway.

Really great flavor! Realistically this is more than 4 servings, so I think the nutrition facts are in the wrong proportions. I had some powdered peanut butter that I want to use up which helped this be lower in fat but that was the only change. Will make again!

I couldn't find a poblano so I used a green bell and threw in 3 serrano peppers, sliced in half. Other than that, by the recipe. It is gourmet delicious.

My girls and I LOVE curry but I have not been able to make it at home so that it tastes like our favorite Thai place. I decided to try this recipe, giving it 'one last try' - I am so thankful! I followed the recipe exactly and it is super delicious. The flavors blend perfectly. I was concerned about the lack of coconut milk but you do not miss it. Creamy, yummy goodness. Thanks for the save!

WOW!!!! This was amazing. I added 1/2 cup more chicken broth and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. This was so good. I didn't change anything else. Chef John knocked another one out of the park. Everyone had smiles on their faces after the first bite. This is definitely going into the rotation!

I made this for dinner one evening for my husband and we both loved this dish. It's a thick and flavorful curry that will suit all palates. I have been requested to repeat this for meals!

Amazing, Chef John.  This is fantastic. It is a dish that stands on its own without advertising it as a curry. One of my guests hates curry but loved this and asked for more. I just called it "spiced peanut chicken". 
Do not omit the lime juice over it before serving. It mellows out the texture and flavor. I tasted it before adding lime and thought it may need a dollop of cream fraiche, but when I added lime, it was perfect. Next time I may try both.

I really enjoyed this dish. I used chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs  and carrots instead of zucchini because that's what I had on hand. Next time I might use a little less peanut butter, especially since I used Jif natural  peanut butter and it is pretty sweet. So of course I didn't use any sugar.    Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, I used store brand peanut butter because that is what I had on hand. The store didn't have pablano peppers so I omitted them. Also did not add zucchini squash. I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar at the end of cooking.

I adjusted amounts: 2 thighs, half the spices, full amount of veggies; and needed most of the broth. It was fantastic. Next time I would add some pineapple and mushrooms.  This had great flavor and is company worthy. Thanks for another fantastic recipe, Chef John!

Since becoming vegan a couple months ago I've had a very hard time finding a good peanut curry that could be easily veganized. Thankfully I found this gem. I didn't add any meat or meat substitutes and didn't have the veggies so I cut the spices in half and added red pepper powder until right. I love recipes that are easy to have fun with :) And my husband devoured it like it was air XD

My husband said this was the best chicken dish I have ever made.  I have to say it was very special.  Every ingredient gave it it's own special taste.

I know I will be making this again!  Awesome Chef John!!

Delicious and filling. Even my kids liked it! The only thing that I left out was the ginger because my store did not have any. Substituted with ground ginger, but will have to try with fresh next time. The only thing I might change is to add slightly less peanut butter to make it a little less heavy. This is a definite keeper!

This was delicious, but it took a lot longer to make than suggested. To say that all the prep can be done in 15 minute is unrealistic. Also there are two steps at 30 minutes each, but before that there are several cooking steps.  The 1 hour cooking time is impossible if you follow the directions.

The only changes I made were that I used an orange bell pepper instead of a poblano pepper, I used skinless/boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs,  and I used regular peanut butter because I didn't have any natural unsweetened peanut butter on hand. The recipe still turned out great-I will definitely make this again.

I made a half recipe with 5 thighs for myself and husband for dinner. I didn't have the veggies or lime on hand but went ahead with the rest and just had some steamed veggies with it. Both my husband and I thought it was delicious. I'll make it again following the recipe exactly for my family and double the recipe. I know this is something the grand kids will like.

Amazing. I added cream at the last 5 minutes - would also be great with coconut milk. Great flavor but not spicy- perfect for my husband, and I added red pepper flakes to my portion. My only compliant- too salty, add less next time. It may have been my broth though, I used a box of veggie stock instead of chicken. Overall I will definitely make again

Made this dish as directed and it was very good.  Found that it actually needed about a tbsp and a half more brown sugar to cut the peanut butter taste a little and give a bit more contrast to the peppers and zuccini.  Will definitely be making this again.

A favorite. Just outstanding. Have made this several times.  Never put in the ketchup or brown sugar and it's not missed.  We aren't eating sugar and carbs in my house, so serve without rice. Of course it IS better with rice. Served to guests last night with some nice fluffy basmati and it was delicious and such a hit.  Be prepared to be asked for the recipe. Yum.

This was fantastic!  The only things I did different were:  Use Bone/Skinless chicken breast (on sale), used chunky JIF peanut butter (omitted the brown sugar and reduced the peanuts a wee bit to compensate), used 3 cups chix stock and 1/2 cup lite coconut milk (unsweetened), and used 2 bell peppers and 1 cubed sweet potato in lieu of the Zucchini.    It makes a ton so be ready for leftovers.  Flavors were just right.  Perhaps next time I will add a little red pepper flakes to the spice blend for a tad more heat.  Will certainly make again!!

Fantastic recipe.  Very Thai in feeling and flavoring.  Since my wife and I can't eat coconut due to an allergy, this was the closest we'd had to a really good and hearty Thai curry chicken.

My wife doesn't like spice, so I substitute the unsalted peanut butter with Skippy creamy peanut butter. Did 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper, and substituted red bell pepper for the poblano pepper. Amazingly tasty dish!

Quite doable for a novice like me. I dislike the taste of peanut butter and so I only used two heaping tablespoons of it. I still found the peanut butter taste too strong for my preference, but my mother and sister told me to put more in next time haha.

This fabulous recipe doesn't need any more rave reviews, but here goes anyway. We really loved this dish, served with basmati rice - my adult son went back for thirds, if not fourths! I had all the spices on hand and used my own peanut butter. The only changes I made concerned the veggies - I used frozen peas, as we don't have zucchini at this time of year. I had no poblamo pepper,  so left it out. Next time (and there will be many) I will add another source of heat such as red pepper flakes or a little hot sauce. I also had no cilantro, but I don't care for it. Thumbs up all around, and thanks, Chef John! By the way, this recipe made more than 4 servings, so the calorie count was considerably reduced per serving.

This is my number one favorite soup, it is very savory and satisfying.  I did cut the cayenne pepper on my first try just because I was a little wary of how hot it would be.  This is a labor intensive soup, lots of chopping. This recipe makes a lot and is well worth it.

This was my first attempt at a curry and I loved it! Big hit with the family too which was somewhat of a surprise given that my husband doesn't like vegetables and my kids don't like anything spicy. I did leave out the poblano pepper to dial down the heat. Would have been great with a little heat in my opinion.

What a great recipe! I didn't have a Poblano pepper, but I didn't miss it at all. I only had 2 pounds of chicken, so I had tons of wonderful sauce. I added white sweet potatoes, instead of sweets (they are more neutral in flavor). They were fantastic! This recipe is definitely a keeper! My husband even loved it, and he's not a big fan of curry.

I  made this  tonight  and it is delicious! I  took  advice  from  some of  the  other  reviewers and it's  so good  you can  make  it  any way  you  want  it. I  used chicken  breast and eliminated the brown  sugar. I  used chili  sauce  instead  of  ketchup, but  I  don't  know  that  it mattered. I  also  used coconut  oil  instead  of  vegetable  oil. You  can  try to keep  the  portions  small  to save  the  calories, but  you'll  still  go for seconds and maybe  even  thirds! Thanks  Chef John. I  have  another  keeper!

Confession:  I changed a few things.  I used chicken breast instead of thigh meat;  I  pretty much doubled the spices, except for the salt;  I used JIF creamy peanut butter and skipped the brown sugar as a trade-off;  Didn't add zucchini or peppers, but just threw in some thickly sliced organic carrots  toward the end and let them simmer until tender before I served it.  ALL that said....this is a SPECTACULAR dish!!  One of the very best recipes I have ever made from AllRecipes (and I've used this site for just about as long as I can remember...10 years, maybe?)!!  Do yourself and your friends and family a favor and try this recipe!

For a lower calorie  option omit the peanut butter.  Try a bit less chicken stock.

This was delish!!!!  Used 1 large boneless, skinless chicken breast, and only 3 garlic cloves.  I only used 2 C. chicken broth, 1 cup made with bouillion cube and 1 cup was unsalted boxed already made chicken stock.  I tried to only use 1 C. to start with but needed the other cup when I added vegetables.  Only used 1/2 C. peanut butter and no brown sugar.  Used 1/2 a large green pepper, no zucchini and 1 peeled, diced sweet potato.

Writing this as we eat. This going to become a new staple in our house. It's so delicious! So much flavor. I did a couple substitutions, because I was using what I already had on hand. We made a double batch so we could have leftovers.

Thank you chef John!  This recipe is a keeper. We followed the recipe as is except we used regular peanut butter and left out the sugar. It was delicious and will be added to our dinner rotation of menus.

I actually realized I didn't have coriander when i started to put everything together, so I actually substituted the coriander with yellow curry powder and it came out amazing. I also put cilatro in it instead of just as a garnish. Just plain awesome....and the wonderful perfume all these spices create in your kitchen will def have people knocking at your door asking what's for dinner

This dish takes time to put together - it requires a fair amount of prep work, plus an hour of simmering. But it's pretty good. It has a very complex flavor, especially if you add the cilantro and lime juice.

Very delicious and flavorful.  I used coconut oil to brown the chicken as someone else recommended. It added an additional depth of flavor.  I also substituted Kashmiri chili for the paprika for additional heat (without making it overwhelmingly spicy).  I would definitely make it again, but perhaps cut back on the natural peanut butter to half a cup b/c after the liquid reduced with cooking, the taste of the peanut butter became very concentrated.  This was my first time making a recipe by Chef John and can't wait to try another.

WOW! Just made this for dinner tonight and it is fabulous. A new family favorite. I try to follow the recipe exactly the first time I make any new dish, but did have two changes- we were out of "normal" ketchup and so used a siracha ketchup. And as we like a thicker curry, only used one cup of chicken broth. Visually pleasing, the kitchen smells great and it tastes as good as any I have had in restaurants. Don't skip the peanuts- they are a delightful topping!

Flavor is amazing! I have tried with chicken breasts as well as thighs and it is definitely better with the thighs. This is the only recipe I have found that is worth dealing with chicken thighs but it's my daughter's favorite and it is so worth it!

I made this for my family the other night and it was excellent. I added a can of coconut milk and substituted Ancho chili powder for the cayenne chili powder because the rest of my family doesn't like spicy food. I made the soup on Monday and let it sit in the fridge overnight for the flavors to meld and then reheated on Tuesday evening and added the zucchini, poblano pepper and bell pepper at the last minute to keep them crispier.

This recipe is definitely a keeper and with fall and winter coming up I'll be including this recipe in the rotation!

This was an incredible recipe! I did use cayenne in the seasoning and omitted the poblano peppers. Next time I will use a bit less salt. We like it spicy, and found tasting important before adding more heat. This recipe was enough to serve 5 bowls for dinner and have 2 more for lunch tomorrow. You can always stretch the recipe with additional rice. I also shortened the cooking time a bit...after the chicken was cooked, sautéed onion, garlic and ginger, then added everything except the garnish ....cooked about 30 minutes together. Fabulous flavors!

Totally worth the long simmer time!  I made it exactly to the recipe, aside from omitting the extra roasted peanuts. The flavours were amazing and my only regret was that I didn't include more chicken thighs. Included the zucchini in a chunky dice and it didn't go mushy/unpleasant. This makes lots of sauce so I'm half-way to a great tofu curry later this week!

Great!!!!! I doubled the cumin since my family loves it - everything else unchanged. I let the chicken marinate in the spices for a few hours in the fridge before cooking. Makes tons and to me it tasted even better the 2nd day. This turned out so well that I am using this recipe in a Pot Luck cooking challenge at work!

I was looking for yet another recipe to use zucchini - we had way too many from the garden this year.  This dish was a big hit with the family.  My husband just finished his third helping.  I was worried that it would be too spicy for my kid but she loved it too.  Definitely adding this to the dinner rotation.

This was absolutely delicious. Thought I would miss not using coconut milk  but  I didn't. I used chicken breast (3 lbs) and added 2 sweet potatoes as another reviewer suggested. Served over rice. Thank you again Chef John for sharing.

My honey and I love trying different curries at different restaurants, so I gladly gathered the ingredients to make this a few nights ago. My first disclaimer is that I did use regular Jif peanut butter rather than natural pb, but I also cut back the brown sugar. I didn't rate the recipe down for sweetness, though. I gave it only three stars because the peanut butter taste overwhelmed the recipe. He and I both like peanut butter, but the sauce was just so rich and peanut buttery that it got old really fast. We chose to use fresh green beans in place of the red pepper (so yummy!) The chicken pieces tasted great, so if I were to make it again (unlikely, but perhaps I'll let the kids try it sometime), I will cut back on the sauce and serve with a slotted spoon with a salad on the side for balance.

I made it but blew the recipe in one area, I used natural fresh ground peanut butter and boy did it cause it to go grainy. So, I fixed it the next day by adding more chicken broth, a quite a bit more and a little more ketchup. Next time, I'll use the smooth natural peanut butter in a jar.

Once I fixed my mistake...this was a GREAT dish.

This dish was what my palate needed . I added crunchy peanut butter , more curry powder and used yellow squash instead of zucchini. I did not concern my self with calories will do extra at the gym. I know peanut butter in high in calories. Just enjoyed.

Awesome meal. My son who seldom compliments my food said this is the best food I ever made. My husband said it makes him want to spit, which he assures me is a compliment. My friend, Jan who stopped over with a bottle of wine spontaneously while I was making this recipe, said this recipe is a keeper.  I loved the cilantro, lime and peanuts I added to the end of this meal. Perfect as is. Don't change a thing! My family didn't add any hot sauce, a sign it had enough heat.

I have never rated anything on Allrecipes. For that I feel bad. But today is the day I rate something because of all the recipes I've made, this is, perhaps, the best. All I changed was that I doubled the cayenne and I added a couple of Thai chilies from the garden (diced). My wife is currently looking at me as if I am Emeril. Despite the time and sweat that went into it (my Bernese Mountain Dog ate my bag of bulk roasted peanuts so I had to drive back to the grocery store), I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing!  Family loved it, only thing I would change for next time, is to cut back on the chicken broth by 1/2 so sauce would be a bit thicker. Other than that, this recipe is delicious !

I hate cooking, but I loved making this. I find cooking to be one of daily life's most dreadful experiences, and yet still managed to enjoy myself. Most importantly it turned out delicious. I am hella broke, and so, I used a whole giant zucchini from the garden and didn't buy peppers (worked out great). I also didn't buy crushed peanuts and opted for bacon bits. No one was the wiser :)

This recipe was delicious! I loved the addition of the zucchini! I followed this recipe exactly and would do so again.  You could always add different combinations of vegetables if you're trying to use up what you have, but the spices were perfect!

Chef John Knocked this one out of the park. This was amazing! Follow this recipe as written and you will not be disappointed. I used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy because that's what I like. Try it, you'll like it!

Excellent! Took a little longer than 15 mins to prep but next time would be faster, of course. I didn't add poblano peppers because my kids are wimpy about spice and I went easy on the onions and garlic so my hubby would still kiss me goodnight- it was still delicious. Flavors are layered and sophisticated.

This review is from someone who can't stand Curry. The peanut butter smoothed out the flavors and I loved it. May spice it up a little next time. Passed it on to my daughter who made it for her roommates - thumbs up all around.

Delicious dish!!! The only thing I changed was the broth, 1/4 less so the curry would be thicker . Everyone in my family LOVED it, down to the great grand kids that said they didn't like Zucchini, they were the first to say how much they liked it. I will make this again for sure!!!

Threw everything into a slow cooker on high for 4 hours. SO easy and the taste was outstanding! I omitted the zucchini because I was afraid it would get too mushy with this cooking method.

Amazingly easy and delicious!
I made a few changes to match what I had on hand and it still turned out great. I didn't have chicken, but added diced cauliflower along with the rest of the veggies. Used Jif crunchy peanut butter, and hardly any extra brown sugar (since Jif is pretty sugary already).
My stove is hard to turn down low, so I added extra chicken broth.
Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I love this recipe. Making tonite for guests. Don't need as much chicken broth, I used. 2 cups. I also left my thighs intact and grilled them 3 min/ side to brown and then added to pot. Saves a lot of mess. Also cooking time too long In 5original recipe. I cooked 30 min total once added chicken to pot.

Really good recipe. I used a pressure cooker for the last steps (simmering the chicken, veggies, etc.) and it turned out amazing. Next time I'll try with rice noodles. Cilantro and lime were a nice touch.

This recipe did not disappoint. However, I omitted the sugar and it was plenty sweet enough. Additionally, I halved the cayenne pepper --  it still had enough kick. Plus, I used chicken breasts rather than thighs.  We all loved it and will certainly enjoy it again in the very near future. Finally, I must add that the squeeze-of-lime is an essential ingredient -- it adds a wonderful tanginess.

Made it just the way CJ specified, and it was really good. Easily serves 4-6 people, too.  My wife says "you can make this again any time."

I used chicken breast instead of thighs. Cut the breasts into thigh size  and added the browned breast pieces with the veggies. Yummy my family loved it.

Made this the other night and WOW!  Now one of my all time favs! "  What's not to love about the flavors of peanut butter, ginger, cayenne, cumin, garlic, turmeric, paprika, coriander, making a creamy sauce for pieces of sauteed chicken, served over Basmati rice and topped with cilantro. Simply delish!  Hint: Easier if you assemble all the ingredients first. I omitted the brown sugar and used a can of chopped green chilies rather than a fresh one.

No wonder it got 5 stars. I printed it and made it  right after because I didn't know what to make with my chicken cutlets.  Wow....pretty easy if you have all the spices in (and I did, thank you),  My husband is sooooo boring and thinks he doesn't like curry" and loved it. I changed NOTHING!

This was, quite simply, OUTSTANDING! Made as written other than we used regular peanut butter rather than unsweetened as that is what we had on hand. Don't change a thing.

only deviation I made was that I used chicken breasts instead of thighs...I was really anticipating a curry flavor although had my doubts since the spice mixture didn't smell like curry...
So aside from that disappointment, it was good albeit a little too  runny  although the rice absorbed some of that...
So try it, it's good.

My kids loved it. I love spice so probably a little extra of cumin and time tic etc. Lots of ginger and garlic. Light in the hot pepper because my daughter doesn't like hear but lovers the flavour.

I just made this and it's really good!! I only made half of the recipe and there is no way that  this would only be 2 servings. This will end up feeding about 4-6 people easily. So, the calorie count is not correct per serving. I did add some pepper flakes to add just a little more heat.  I also sliced some carrots, celery and added some green beans. Great recipe!!

It was awesome! I try to make a recipe exactly as written the first time. That said, I did leave the sugar out as we just don't like added sugar and other reviews indicated it wasn't necessary. They were right. My husband, who likes really spicy food said it was great and I loved it. Well done Chef John

I followed chef John's recipe and we all enjoyed it very much, I can understand not using the coconut milk and agree with the sweetness as this turned out better than others I've tried (using coconut milk) will use this recipe again and again.

Was looking for an easy and tasty curry recipe for a long time, and here you are! I tried two versions of it: with chicken and with tofu for my vegetarian friends, both worked awesome! I added tofu together with veggies for the last 30 minutes just to make sure it won't be overcooked. Next time will try it with chicken breasts to reduce calories and fat, besides it's not always easy to find skinless boneless thighs in the store.

Delicious, the changes I made:

Used Eggplant instead of zucchini.
Less salt, and no sugar. 
No paprika. ( I forgot to add it)
My family and I loved it. 
Will make it again!!!

It is easy to make and delicious. I left off the garnish - peanuts as we had a young child with only 18 teeth. The adults added the "heat" extra for themselves. We all loved it.

Excellent meal for a crowd.  I used a can of lite coconut milk in place of some of the broth, and I added shredded unsweetened coconut, raisins, and cooked yam chunks.  I omitted the sugar. After browning the chicken, I put it with the sauce in my slow cooker and left it for several hours on low. Because there was a lot of sauce, I added prepared couscous to soak it up. Rave reviews from all!

This was good but needed some modifications.

Added cardamom and fenugreek to the curry mix. Upped the cayenne to a full teaspoon. I love Curry heat! Too much peanut butter, 1/2 cup should suffice. Doubled the grated ginger. Used a fresh Jalapeno instead of a poblano.  Needed more vegies so I added a can of bamboo shoots just cause that is what I had on hand and it added texture variation. This needs a something to cut through the chicken fat and peanut butter. Next time it will be white wine and chicken stock 50/50. The lime juice helps. Perhaps chicken breasts but thighs are so good!

I would make this again. Real Thai Jasmine rice was good.

This recipe was amazingly good.  One reviewer suggested sweet potato, so I added that; I also had some white mushrooms that I had to use up, so I threw those in, as well.  I halved the salt,  used chunky natural pb, and did not add extra peanuts.  Aside from these small changes, I didn't mess with this recipe.  Served over basmati rice.  Man, was it good--thank you, Chef John!

I made this with no changes and it was the BOMB.  It was very rich so even though we wanted second helpings there was no way we could have.  I have to say it was more work than I'm used to doing for one meal.  I don't enjoy cooking though. but I will use Johns recipes anytime!

I did as one reviewer did and added an extra pepper. This was delicious. Even my zucchini hating son ate the zucchini because the spice flavor masked the zucchini flavor. I plan on adding some cauliflower next time.

This is to die for...I only used 1/2 tsp of salt.  I doubled all the other spices (not the salt)....I used 1 and 1/4  pounds of chicken breast.  I used coconut oil instead of veggie oil.....no sugar....carrots instead of zucchini....Jasmine rice.....scallions instead of cilantro.....so good..

It was delicious. The seasonings were spot on. I would probably make it by oiling a rotisserie chicken to make the cooking time faster.
I am becoming a true fan of chef john

Made this recipe by the directions except I used half yellow squash from our garden and doubled the recipe. Plenty of leftovers!  Delicious with just the right amount of heat. Used brown rice. Will definitely be making again.

An absolutely fantastic meal.  Either my chicken cooked slowly, or the cooking time is off, because it took me longer to prepare this meal than the stated time.  The lime juice is key as it really makes the flavors pop: don't omit it!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Chef.  This meal is a joy, and it will be added to the repertoire.

Of course there were changes, not necessarily because I wanted to.  I used reg iodized salt,  green pepper for the red, reg peanut butter for the "au natural", no corriander (had none), chicken breasts for thighs, no poblano pepper,   but it was DELISH! I added the veggies soon after the chicken was added to the broth and covered the pan, boiled it down a bit at the end and it was fine.

Thursday is curry night at our house. I get in the coconut curry chicken or shrimp rut, so found this to be a nice change of pace. I did not have any chicken broth, so I substituted vegetable stock. That was the only change I made to Chef John's ingredients. My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe and I am sure it will go into our curry rotation.

This recipe is awesome, however I used coconut milk just to add more depth and creaminess. I used extra peanut butter. Added extra cayenne pepper, in error, I thought I grabbing the paprika. Love, love, love this dish! I will make this again.

We really liked this recipe. It was easy. I had to make some substitutions but nothing unusual. Like another reviewer I used a curry seasoning I had (Penzey's Now Curry) because I was out of paprika.I didn't have zucchini but since a couple of reviewers had used sweet potatoes I figured carrots would work & they did. I used a bit less broth because others said the sauce could be thin. I watch calories so I didn't use the sugar. Definitely a recipe we'll have again. Thank you for the great recipe!

Going to make this tonight!  The only changes I'll make will be to use potatoes and peas for the vegs in the recipe.  Love Chef John's recipes always.  Printed it July 7/16. Update - Wow!  The only change I made was using my homemade beef stock.  This makes a lot and is delicious and gets better the next day.

The only "changes" I made was not adding the extra peanuts to garnish and I didn't have the time to simmer it for an hour. It was late and the family was starving. That being said, I found the flavors amazing. My very picky son had third servings. I can only imagine how much yummier it would have been with an entire hour to simmer. I will definitely be making this again.

Insanely good!  I made a few changes: chicken breast instead of thighs, 1tsp curry powder + 1 tsp cilantro instead of the coriander (none in the pantry!), extra zucchini, 2 red peppers instead of 1 (no poblano pepper), 1 tsp ground ginger instead of fresh, and brown rice (my staple) instead of white. Leftovers for dinner tonight!
p.s.  I sprinkled raisins over my portion before eating.  Why?  Because I remember my mom making curry and always having multiple condiments for "topping" in the center of the table.  My husband won't touch raisins, so I enjoyed them all on my own :-)

This turned out wonderful. I was a bit skeptical when adding ketchup, and it took much longer to prepare than I expected, but well worth the wait. I followed the directions exactly, adding a tad more broth, and chunky peanut butter, as it was what I had on hand. This recipe is defiantly a keeper.

This was delicious! Not hard to prepare either although not that quick to do. Total time 1 1/2 hours start to finish but totally worth the effort. We devoured it to the last morsel.

Used extra firm tofu instead of the chicken and extra roasted zucchini as I had it prepared and did not have the peppers. The spicing was great, however I used whole coriander not ground and omitted the brown sugar. Thanks Chef John. Yummy.

My teenage daughter is a picky eater and she said this is the best dinner I've ever made!  I will definitely be making this again.

Made it as per recipe, and this is the best peanut curry I have ever had, I served it with Black Sticky Rice.    It's now a family favorite.

I made this using 3 tbsp. of the Diva Curry Blend with yoghurt and a coconut milk.  Very tasty.

This is a great recipe to use boneless skinless thighs, breast, or both.  I backed off the salt and peanut butter as well but everything else was the same.  My one question is.... It's called Peanut Curry Chicken but I saw / used no curry in the recipe.  Is that because the mix of spices creates its own "curry" flavor?  Is that by design?  Just curious.

This is one of the best dishes I have made. My husband and daughter did not rave about it like I did, but they still liked it.  It always takes me longer than the recipe says it will take - this is because prep work clearly takes me longer than they say.  I made this recipe exactly as is.  The only thing I did differently is thicken up the sauce a little with a cornstarch and water mixture.  Thanks for the great recipe Chef John!!

Yesssss....make this!!
I made it to a T. The only two things I would change next time for my personal taste would be to lessen peanut butter to a 1/2 cup and use two red bell peppers instead of just one.
Also, don't skip the squeeze of fresh lime at the end. I tried a couple bites before and after the lime, and the acidity really finishes the dish off in a big way. 
Also, I found my veggies to be cooked after simmering only 20-25 minutes and the sauce was plenty thick. 
So good!!!

I made it exactly the way it was written. If I made it again I would add little more spice because I'd like it hotter.

Wonderful flavour, exactly what I was looking for.  I made a couple changes to use what I had: Two red peppers, chicken breast, added 3 large carrots, and cooked with coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.

Very good, I was concerned that the Pablamo peppers would be too hot  as I am not familiar wth them but they were good.  Definitely will make again
