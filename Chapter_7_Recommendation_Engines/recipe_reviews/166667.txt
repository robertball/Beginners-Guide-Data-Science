Fantastic!!!  I tried this using both a  stainless steel and dark, non-stick pan.  The non-stick worked much better, creating a very delicate and even crisp golden crust.  In stainless steel this took a long time to color and then once it started, the cheese began to burn almost immediately.  My gal pals have added this to the "must haves" for every get together.

absolutely fabulous!!! i cut mine into slabs about 1/2 inch thick as this cheese gets such a beautiful crust as it is fries, keep in mind it doesn't melt when fried, it softens. i find it  nicer in the slabs because there is more crust!!! lol!!! had to have shipped from n.y.c. to find!!! no where, anywhere near, where i live had, has or even serves this cheese...most hadn't heard of it!!! it was worth having sent to my home however and i will continue to do so!!! i had to really look to find this cheese looking first around home then at the greek resturants and gourmet shops 3 counties away then finally the internet and i have to say it was worth it!!!!!! p.s. haven't ever given 5 stars and i'm not sure y i haven't but this was close!!

DELISH. I had never used Halloumi before. I love the texture and versatility. I am will surely be making this again. Great with a Greek salad.

My husband brought home a box of this cheese from Cyprus & I kept it in the fridge for months as I didn't know what to do with it!  MY GOD IT WAS FABULOUS!  Now I can't wait for him to go back, so he can bring more home!  It's hard to find locally, but worth searching for.  Thanks Linda!

Quick and satisfying. Halloumi cheese has a high melting point, so it's easy to cook and it tastes great with a dash of fresh lemon. I saw Nigella Lawson make a salad with spring mix, grilled halloumi and a soft-boiled egg on TV once. It's really good. I'll upload a picture the next time I'm in the USA. It's worth making.

This is really great and the lemon adds a great acidic touch. Paired with a side salad with cucumbers and you have a healthy meal. You can also grill this cheese over indirect heat.

This is such a simple recipe, but the results are absolutely fantastic!   Believe it or not, I sometimes omit the herbs (keeping the lemon) and serve the cheese topped with sour cherry spread.  It is addictive that way, and it is perfect for tea, lunch, or even breakfast.  Try it!

Loved this! Halloumi's expensive, but this was a great treat. Salty, crispy, lemony. Delicious!

I love that this recipe lets the Halloumi shine. It's such a savory, interesting cheese. My first batch released a lot of fluid (water, it seemed) but didn't affect the flavor or browning at all. Keeping the sticks thick allow the unique texture to come through. Along with other reviewers, I preferred using a non-stick skillet, but well-seasoned cast iron works fine. Made a roasted tomato soup with oregano and crusty baguette to finish the meal.

What the instructions failed to tell you; 

You need a hot pan to get the golden brown. Medium heat may not get you there. We had to turn the pan up! 

Olive oil: Less is more. You really only need a couple drops or you'll boil the cheese and it won't crisp. 

The seasoning is fantastic. Oregano or Italian seasoning and lemon juice sprinkled to taste. 

You're welcome. We used a non stick pan.

Made no changes. It was tasty.  I had to be patient to get all the pieces nice and brown, but it was worth it. The lemon juice really adds that extra something.

I prepared this tonight per the instruction.  We thought this was really good and made it a keeper.  I did turn up the heat to med-high and flipped them a few times over about 4 minutes and got that great crust.

It turned into a gelatinous mess once in the pan.
