"MMM MMM," said my husband when he tasted this. I did everything 'as is,' I only substituted garlic salt for celery salt and olive oil for canola because I didn't have any; I added a bit of cayenne pepper for kick. Mustard, oil and vinegar were spot on. Tastes better when the potatoes have been marinating in the dressing for awhile. Light and flavorful, I'll be making it again, I've been told.

Thanks Krista for this wonderful light and flavorful potato salad recipe. My boyfriend hates mayo so this was a wonderful change. I especially liked the grilling of the potatoes after par cooking, it gave the potatoes such a wonderful texture. (2 thumbs up!)

This is easy and a good alternative to the mayonnaise-heavy kind.  I added some dill and some horseradish, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Good hot or cold!

Thank you Krista for this delicious recipe. I will make it over and over again I'm sure! As far as changes, I only had Yukon Gold potatoes, so that was all I used, but I'm sure it's delicious with the red-skins combined with Yukons, so I'll try it that way next time. Since I made this in the middle of the last big snowstorm we had I just broiled the potatoes in my oven. I lined the broiler pan with foil and it was very easy... and as another reviewer said, it gives the potatoes a great texture and helps them absorb some of the delicious dressing. Finally, because we're all bacon fanatics in our house, I added 4 crumbled slices and then, just because, I threw in about 1/4C. chopped celery and 1/4C. chopped green onion. I'm sorry! I know I shouldn't make so many changes, but OMG it was really, really delicious... even better than Grandma's German Potato Salad from my childhood! Again Krista, many thanks!!

A very simple and tasty recipe that you can adjust to your liking with the ingredients and herbs you have on hand.  I made a few changes that I would recommend. 
*
First, I used regular mustard instead of dijon, and it turned out great with the regular yellow picnic mustard.
*
I used all red potatoes, and used organic extra virgin  olive oil because I only keep that oil on hand (and use it for all baking/cooking regardless of instructions... because I dislike having a cupboard full of condiments!).  I used celery seed plus a bit of salt because I don't have celery salt.  I also added 2 very large cloves of garlic, minced, and a handful of fresh rosemary from my garden, coarsely chopped.  
*
Once I cooked the potatoes, I coated them with the entire mixture, then transferred them to a single layer on foiled pans.  Brioled in the oven until brown, turning them once (broiled for about 10 minutes, watching carefully). 
*
Once that was all done I cooled them, then tossed with a few shakes of dried dill in the original bowl that I had mixed them in (there was about a tablespoon of the oil mixture left).  Delicious!

We loved this. Next time I will cut back a bit on the canola oil, but the flavor was delicious and complimented our grilled chicken perfectly.

I didn't try the entire recipe, but I did use the dijon vinigrette on my reguarly prepared potato salad - and it was amazing. A perfect mayo alternative.

Amazing!  I put EVOO on the potatoes right b4 grilling and then after grilling put the potatoes in a freezer bag with the marinade and set in fridge for a few hours to soak up the marinade.  Right b4 serving I chopped up some fresh cilantro about 1/2 c worth and tossed it in the salad.  Everyone loved it!  Was terrific~

This is a wonderful recipe. I boiled the potato the night before and pour half of the dressing when it's still hot. Next day, I spread on the baking sheet and finished off the cooking. It was well seasoned to he center of the potato. Not many recipes stay in my cook book, but this is truly a keeper. I use garlic power and some salt, just because that's all I had. Krista, Thank you for sharing!!!

I decreased the oil to 1/8 cup and added a tsp of horseradish and used about 1/4 tsp garlic salt and 1/4 tsp celery salt.  My husband thought it was fantastic.  I used a grilling basket to let more of the smoky taste come through.  If you like it tangy, you will love this.

FANTABULOUS! - the exact word my husband used to describe these potatoes!  even my 12 year old loved them.  the only thing i did differently was to use olive oil instead of canola oil because it's what i had on hand.  and i broiled instead of grilled.  thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I've been questioning whether I want to continue using canola. It's the processing I question. Although more expensive, olive oil, and more recently avocado oil, have been doing a nice job. (davo avocado is so good)

super simple to make, yukon gold taters were definitely a good choice for this dish, since i was cooking in the middle of the night used the broiler instead of the grill and only change i made was using yellow mustard instead of dijon (due to fridge contents).  after boiling, broiled top rack on low for 15 minutes turning often and came out perfectly browned and crispy.

I did make a couple of changes though not earth shattering. I doubled the recipe, used all yukon golds since I had some I needed to use up. Didn't use celery salt since I didn't have any rather I used celery seed and a bit of salt. Other than those minor changes kept it the same and it was delish!!!!!!!! Even my picky 7yo ate them =0

As an avid hater of mayonnaise, I am highly pleased to say this is delicious!  The dijon mustard and the vinegar make for a very nice sweet and tart combination, without being too much of either.

Very good. Followed recipe exactly. Added a little celery and scallions. Next time I will probably add some additional spice... maybe some cayenne and apple cider vinegar instead of white. Thanks for the recipe!

Don't paraboil the potatoes; seriously, it's not necessary. In fact, it turns them into mush. You can broil your potatoes until they are fork tender but still firm on the grill. I tossed them in a bit of olive oil and spices, and then after they were roasted and cooled, I tossed with dressing and served room temperature. They were pretty good, although not great - it's not a salad and not quite a roasted potatoes. We had a few leftovers.

This recipe is a little too oily and the vinegar is over powering.  I doctored the sauce by adding a pinch of sugar and adding more potatoes.  This was good for a vegan dish, but not great.

All my friends say this is the best potato salad ever.  I use EVOO in place of canola, and balsamic vinegar in place of white (a little less than called for as balsamic is pretty flavorful).  I also add about 1 T of regular mustard, double the Dijon mustard and add fresh oregano. Sometimes I skip the  Yummers!  (Sometimes I skip the grilling part, too, if I'm in a rush or being lazy.  It's still great!)  Now if we could just get the summer weather to arrive, we'd be all set!

The sauce was great. We ended up grilling the potatoes longer than suggested, which everyone thought was a good idea. My kids loved it, but everyone felt like it was missing something.  One reviewer suggested tossing it on a salad, which we will try next time.  My husband suggested serving it with other grilled vegetables. I also recommend making a little extra sauce.  Will make the recipe again.

I cannot even begin to describe how amazingly delicious this recipe is.  I was floored; so was my boyfriend.  I followed the recipe to a 'T', and it came out perfectly.  AWESOME!

Not bad.  Not truly "grilled" at all.  Boiled, yes; grilled, no.  Same result whether boiled on your gas/electric stove as water boiled on a gas grill as there is no difference.

A very nice, easy recipe. The sauce was a bit bland for my tastes so I made some additions/substitutions. Instead of using 3 tbsp of white vinegar, I used 1 1/2 tbsp white vinegar and 1 1/2 tbsp red wine vinegar. I also added 1/2 tsp. dill weed, 1 tbsp mayo and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I also substituted crack black pepper for the ground pepper. Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out quite tasty. I forgot to cube the potatoes before boiling them so some were a bit undercooked when finished but still very good. I doubled the sauce mix since the potatoes I used were huge. I put them on non-stick foil on the grill and turned them at about 5 minutes then again a few minutes later, taking them off after about 9 minutes total. Am considering adding chives or rosemary to the mix next time for an extra umph but otherwise very happy with this recipe.

This recipe is almost like a French potato salad except without the herbs and something in the onion/garlic family which I think I would prefer because it was missing that 'something' to make it pop and 'something' to make the taste a little more complex. I love what the additional step of grilling the potatoes did for the dish and next time I will make more dressing for additional drizzling because after chilling most all the sauce was absorbed and it would have been nice to freshen it with just a little more. There was plenty of sauce if you were eating it right away. I'll make this again with some minor tweaks for my taste. Nice change from the standard.

VERY tasty. Simple. Really quick. And i expect it will be even better tomorrow, after a day of resting in the fridge. i used a bag of small red potatoes and diced them into 8ths (halved then quartered each half). and instead of grilling after par-boiling i broiled.  i had olive oil instead of canola.  and no celery salt.  Everything else i did the same.

Based on the other reviews, I added one teaspoon horseradish and 1/2 teaspoon of dried dill.  I substituted diet Italian salad dressing for the canola oil. The Dijon mustard is yummy in this recipe.

Extremely good!  I used regular salt (didn't have celery salt on hand) and less oil (we like vinegar) - this came out very tasteful and everyone, including the picky eaters, raved about it!

Had a great flavor to it.  We used garlic salt in place of celery and used olive oil instead of canola.  I also grilled in on our indoor griddle and it came out great.  I want to try it on our BBQ to see if it makes a difference!

I think this has too much vinegar;  I think next time I will use only 1 tablespoon vinegar.  I also added salt; the celery salt wasn't enough.  I used only the Yukon Gold potatoes.  They were small so I cut them up and cooked them on the grill skipping the boiling them in water step.  I also used avacado oil in place of the canola; I think extra virgin olive oil would be good also, so I plan to try that next time.

I just used six of whatever potatoes I had.  We really liked it. Next time I think I would put more of the dressing on before grilling, and save a bit less to drizzle on after. It was really delicious.

I thought this recipe was a fair amount of work, since it calls for boiling and then grilling the potatoes with frequent turning, but it was so good it was worthwhile.  I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 avocado oil instead of the canola oil.  Also, since I didn't have celery salt, I used 1/4 tsp celery seed and 1/4 tsp sea salt.   Also, I used three or four more potatoes of each kind, and that seemed to be the right amount to serve four, and we are not big eaters!

I've been making this recipe for a few years now and it's become a family Favorite. You can also throw other veggies like full mushrooms, zucchini or whatever you might have on hand and it's all good.
I also almost always use the mini potatoes. Throw them in a pot to boil for 15 like the recipe says, then cut them in half, throw them in a bbq pan with the rest of the recipe ingredients and cook just like the recipe. Multi coloured potatoes little really pretty too. ????????

This is a good start, but I think it had a little bit too much vinegar and not enough mustard. Next time, I might double the sauce as it got a little lost. Also, some of the potatoes picked up some bbq sauce which was super tasty.

We love this version of potato salad!  My husband doesn't like the mayo-based salads, so I'm glad I found this.  Even though I add a little garlic powder, I rated this with 5 stars because we really liked it the first time I made it without the garlic; it just adds a bit more oomph to it (but not enough to knock it down to 4 stars).

Really yummy!  I try to never make revisions before rating and we didn't except by accident.  I missed the part about putting the potatoes on foil and we put the potatoes directly on the grill grates.  They still turned out crispy and they had delicious charred grill marks that added a smoky element.  Thanks for sharing!  Will definitely make again & again!

Magnificent! I made homemade "Dijon" style mustard months ago and was pleasantly surprised how well the flavors melded and complimented each other.  Just before serving, I chop up fresh tarragon and parsley, squeez in one fresh lemon and toss in some kosher salt. This is the most requested salad by even the pickiest of eaters in our family. Thank you!!!!

This is easy and delicious! My 12 year old kept sneaking more when we weren't looking. ;) next time I'll use a bit more dressing. They were a bit dry, but still very good!

Super yummy and easy.  Can boil the potatoes earlier in the day and get them soaking in the marinade.  Good warm or cold.  I used garlic salt b/c I didn't have celery salt. Grilling them brings out a great flavor.

Fantastic!  I served this at a BBQ to rave reviews.  I doubled the recipe and used seasoned salt and a touch of garlic powder in place of the celery salt.  I also used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon.  I did not need to toss the potatoes with the rest of the dressing at the end - they were already flavorful enough.

Loved it!  This will be a regular at our cook outs.  I think I will try red wine vinegar the next time I try it.  The celery seed was a nice addition.

Not many recipes make me bend in the knees with love. This is one of them. Add 1/2 t dried dill and followed the est of the recipe. So delicious!

I made some modifications in the prep work, otherwise would give this 5 stars as the end result was delish and my family loved it.  I didn't boil the potatoes at all (why dirty a pot ha ha) just baked them skins on on the bbq. Then cut them into a bowl and add the dressing (used olive oil)! Love it!

You can make this in the kitchen. The grilling part does not taste grilled when you boil first. We had this today for Labor Day bbq and no one cared for it.

While this recipe is good, I did make a few changes: 1. I only used baby red potatoes. 2. I had to substitute olive oil for canola and red wine vinegar for white. 3. Based on the recommendations of others, I added more seasonings--garlic salt, dill, pepper, celer seed. 4. I topped it with feta cheese. 
I have not decided if I will make it again.

My young children loved this recipe.  My 4 yr old had 3 helpings.  Potato salad is always a favorite but if you are grilling anyway, try this, it is amazing.  I did add some dill to the dressing but that was all that I changed.  Will definitely make this again and is good enough for company!!

Not much tatse to it.  Although I like the idea of finishing off a salad on the grill, next time I'll just do it all in the kitchen, and add some more flavor.
