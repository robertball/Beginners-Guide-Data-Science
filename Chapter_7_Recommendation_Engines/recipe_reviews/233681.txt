Delicious! I do have to say that these took a bit more time to make than I expected mostly because the batter was thick and sticky and hard to spread into the pan (I ended up spraying my hands w/ cooking spray to get it in there evenly and that worked fine). It's more like a half brownie half cookie to me but they are yummy nonetheless. The family really enjoyed these so I will def be making them again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

Yum! This was much better than I expected - my whole family loved this recipe. Like another review this makes a very thick batter but I found using the back of a wet spoon did a good job of spreading the 2 layers out

Absolutely excellent!! I accidentally misread the directions and put the white chocolate chips in the batter and sprinkled the milk chocolate chips on top and they were fantastic!

The "black" part of the brownie was extremely dry. My husband thought so too. Disappointing overall. Will not make again.
