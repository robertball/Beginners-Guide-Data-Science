This tasted really bad unfortunately. We really couldn't eat this. There is way to much sour cream in this recipe. I even cut it down to 1 1/2 cups.  I would cut the sour cream to 1 cup at the most. I had to melt some cheese slices into a serving to be able to eat it. It did help. Needs more cheese too. And the cream of potato soup sounds like a good idea but when you are eating it all of a sudden you get a very large chunk of potato which just is not a good thing. Sorry I just really did not like this recipe.

I have tried it this way before but I find it better when instead of potato soup you use either cream of mushroom or chicken. Also a little more cheese and top it with some crushed cornflakes mixed with butter towards the end for an extra crunch. other than that not to much to change.

This is a classic.  The only thing I prefer is using cheddar cheese.  I also found the Kashi flake cereal makes a healthier topping - since this dish is so loaded with calories! lol

Wow. I am amazed at the bad reviews. whenever I've made this everyone loved it. I just opt for the lighter versions of the creamy stuff

This was not a good idea. My wife and I were going to use this Casserole as part of a pot luck dinner on christmas eve, since we never tryed it before we thought to make one for ourselfs.  We both agreeded that it was to heavy with cream and we decided not to use it.

Pretty good recipe I used a little bit of onion powder instead of chopped onions and only 1 cup of sour cream. I can't imagine using 2 cups of sour cream, it definitely would have been way too much.

I was very surprised at the reviews also. My family really enjoyed this casserole. I did not deviate from the recipe and it turned out absolute marvelous. I will definite cook again. I think I will try the chicken soup next time just because others have recommend. We really enjoyed it and there was no leftovers.

These are cheesy delicious comfort food at its best.  How can you go wrong with potatoes, cheese, sour cream and more cheese?  I am not an onion fan so I left that out, and I used cheese soup to make it extra cheesy.  Yum!

Instead of 2 cans of soup, I only use 1 can. Also, I use cream of chicken or cream of mushroom. After I mix all ingredients, I take about 3 cups of corn flakes (crushed) and add a stick of melted butter and stir together and then spread on top of casserole. It gives it a crunchier texture. Enjoy!

I have been making this recipe since I got it at a potluck when I was 10 years old(my 1st recipe). I add a cup of velveeta with the cheddar and put crushed potato chips on top. I find using 1 can cream of celery and 1 cream of mushroom works alot better than the cream of potato, but that is personal preference. Also to those who say too much sour cream, please remember 1 container of sour cream is 2 cups unless you buy the little one(gave recipe to friend and she made the same mistake thought it meant 2 containers).

I reccommend mixing everything but the hashbrowns first, then slowly stirring them in.  Otherwise it was really good!

This is a really easy, yummy recipe. i highly reccommend. The serving sizes suggested for this recipe are on the large side though. Almost what I would consider a double portion for a side dish.

Great! I used cream of mushroom soup (it's what I had in the pantry) and added a jalapeno for a little heat. Excellent. Everyone loved it!

I like to combine ingredients the night before baking, allowing the potatoes to thaw and flavors to blend. I also double the amount of shredded cheese putting most of the additional cheese on top.  I have also added bacon bits, and another time added a can of green chiles......both additions went over well.

These were very tasty.  I followed the recipe as is and the whole family loved them.  Great instead of mashed potatoes - or any for that matter.  It makes a large cake dish worth, we had great leftovers for the next couple of days.

I agree that there may be too much sour cream if you are the type that prefers a dryer, less mushy casserole. I added half of each (diced) red, green, and yellow bell pepper, and onion. I doubled the parm cheese and kept everything else the same and it's still a little too mushy.. i'd go with half of the sour cream next time just to see if you can get a more cake-like casserole... it's still pretty dang tasty though!

I made this the other night for my family.  It's a great weeknight meal, just open, dump & stir.  I agree, it has way too much sour cream.  Next time I will try 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup whole milk. I think it will help make the dish creamier.  I also used O'brien potatoes and a blend of cheese's.  Spiced it up with garlc powder, onion powder and some crushed red pepper flakes.  I'll update on my next attempt.

Embellished to perfection! I made a few changes to this recipe and it turned out amazing and cooked faster. I substituted hashbrowns with tater tots! While the oven was preheating I put the tater tots in the dish and cooked them while I prepared remaining ingredients. I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken. Chopped one whole small to medium sized onion. Green scallions to taste about 1/6 cup. 6 strips of slightly undercooked bacon chopped. Used only one cup of sour cream, and increased the amount of Cheddar and Parm cheeses. GO LIGHT on the salt for this dish. I would suggest saving the salt and pepper till the dish gets to the table. While you assemble all the remaining ingredients your tater tots are getting cooked. Once all ingredients are combined in the large bowl (approx. 10-15 minutes for me) I added the warmed tater tots and stirred. Then transferred back in to the hot casserole dish and cooked at 400 for about 30 minutes until the top is golden. This casserole is delicious, I suggest also putting ketchup or salsa out to cut the richness. Bon appetit!

Delicious for a family gathering. I made this for an Easter dinner and everyone loved it. I had 17 guests and doubled the recipe with a couple of changes. And let me tell you there wasn't much left! I read some reviews and followed these tips. I assembled it the night before and baked it first thing in the morning. I brought everything to room temp including the frozen hash browns. Mix the soup, onion, sour cream, pepper, and cheddar thoroughly before adding the hash browns. Used two 30 oz. bags plain frozen hash browns, 4 cans cream of potato soup, One 16 oz. and one 8 oz. sour cream, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup parm cheese, Two 8 oz. bars of sharp cheddar shredded (using most but, saving some for tops of both casseroles). pepper to taste. Greased two glass 9x13 dishes and divided mixture and topped with cheese. Baked both at 350 degrees for approx 1-1/2 hours.

I used a 20 oz. bag of hash browns with onion & peppers  , so I cut the rest of the ingredients in half except for the sour cream, i used  1/2 cup, that was enough, I could really taste it, I don't like my food to taste sour.and topped it with crushed potato chips, next time I will try the mushroom soup, I think that would be more to my taste, it was not soupy at all, very thick & filling

Edible but not for me. To much soup and sour cream. I think I will keep looking for something else or tweek this myself using organic veg broth and one light sour cream or at the least something else.

I do not know what else you could want from this recipe. It was great, not a spoonful left and only 5 people were eating it. This will be made again and soon.

I love this recipe. I made it for Easter breakfast and set my oven to automatically turn on so it could cook while we were at church.  Well, I did something wrong in setting my oven because it never turned on. I put the covered casserole in the microwave on High for 20 minutes, then under the broiler on High for a few minutes to brown the top and it was perfect!!  It met rave reviews!  I think I will make it this way from now on.  Thanks to my mistake!!!

Great for office gatherings, pot lucks, and family dinner. Always the first dish empty.
