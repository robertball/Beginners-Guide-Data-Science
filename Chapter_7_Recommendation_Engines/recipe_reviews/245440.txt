I will definitely make these more often and since I love spicy things I will probably add a little more candied ginger and a full teaspoon of cayenne, even though these cookies are perfect with no changes at all

This recipe is a keeper! Everybody at work LOVED them.  I doubled the cayenne and used gold decorative sugar for rolling.  I WILL make them again, but I will double the ginger chips and keep them whole rather than chopping.

I added more on spices, just because I love strong flavor. I was out of Cayanne pepper but over all this recipe was divine. I cooked for 14 minutes crispy on the outside chewy in the inside. 
I will make this recipe again with Cayanne pepper can't wait to try it. I also tried this with drizzled white chocolate. It was divine.! Oh, and the bits of sugared ginger..... Bonus! I love when I bite down and nice chewy bit of ginger!!!! Yummy!!!

Spectacular. My husband isn't a spice fan, but even he enjoyed the cayenne! I baked them crispy. They were delicious and easy to make.

Oh my goodness!  These are to die for! The only thing I did differently was add a little more diced candied ginger (almost a cup) because I really like it! The flavors in this cookie are amazing! If you like ginger cookies, this is the one. Thanks for this recipe! It's a definite keeper!

Most amazing ginger cookie I ever ate! And I didn't have candied ginger, so I doubled the ginger and cinnamon. So so good!

Doubled the spices, added white pepper (just because I had it) instead of the black and could not resist adding Chinese five spice -just because I had it too!  I'm just crazy for that stuff!

These were a true Gingersnap, the best  I have ever had! My family couldn't believe the were homemade.  Great flavor, just the right amount of pepper. I baked for 14 min for a crisp cookie. the only change I made was to sprinkle tops of cookies  with Sugar in the Raw, Turbinado cane sugar before baking. I may add a little more of the candied ginger next time.

I made these and they turned out exactly as described and seen in the video. The only difference in mine was that I got 25 cookies (finished size  3" diameter 1/4 thick), but they are cracked like the photo,  crisp and spicy and just a little darker than I might want them next time. But that might just be the difference in my oven. Bottom line: if you like gingersnaps, this is worth your time and effort. Hubby loves them.

Although I followed the recipe exactly, I sheepishly added the black pepper and cayenne pepper!  It is the perfect cookie!  I doubled the recipe, as they dissappear quickly.  I have used two different types of ginger, and I believe the thicker ginger gives it a better taste, even though its a lot harder to cut up.

Absolutely on point!  These came out really well.  So well in fact, they didn't last the day!  Watch the video for the excellent tips.  And we didn't share. 
 Oh... and double the spices just as everyone recommends.

Best cookies ever!!! I've done the recipe twice, and added more ginger (powder and candied) the second time, just because I like a stronger taste.

The crystalized ginger, pepper, and cayenne are great additions, do not skip. I halved the recipe and rolled my dough for cookie cutters. This is a delicious recipe with the right amount of spice. I am so glad I tried making the cookies. Highly recommended if you enjoy traditional ginger snaps. I baked my cookies for 10 minutes and they were crisp on on the outside and soft on the inside.

The recipe was easy to follow. I would put a bit more cayenne in for a tad bit more heat to offset the candied ginger. The butter is easier to measure at 3/4cup instead of 12 tablespoons

Made this recipe exactly as stated and I have to admit that my family actually fought over these cookies. They were that good. In the end, we were all trying to hide the remaining few so no one else would get them. These are darn delicious! Thanks again Chef John.

A real hit! A true ginger snap. They're a crunchy outside with a chewy inside. I rolled them in Demarara sugar (try raw sugar) for a little more texture. The addition of the candied ginger in genius. I even had "non-cookie" friends extolling thier virtues~

These ginger snap cookies are fabulous. The idea of adding crystallized ginger, cayenne pepper and pepper didn’t make sense in the beginning, but I was intrigued.  I made them and Chef John, you are absolutely right, you can’t just eat one. They are now my favorite ginger snap cookie. I’m going to make them again. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent! I surprised my (adult) daughter and her friends with some cookies for their holiday gift exchange. They were very impressed.  These are sophisticated ginger cookies. As someone else had suggested, I doubled the cayenne. I also added a tsp of Allspice. Next time, I would mince the candied ginger a bit bigger. I might also add a bit more ginger. Maybe even add fresh, as some other recipes do. But very good. 13 minutes in the oven for me, but I don't think I flatted the cookies to 1/4". Also, I suggest flattening before dipping in the sugar if you want to see the sugar at all. I will make these again!

I love this recipe  of one of my life long favorite cookies.  I followed recipe exactly except I rolled the cookie in raw sugar and sprinkled some more on top after flattening prior to baking.  That gave it a little extra crunch.

These were perfect Ginger Snaps. I made them for Christmas gifts, and they were so popular I was asked to make some more, which I did this week.

Delicious!! I'm a big gingersnap fan and I loved these.  Works great with egg whites, spelt flour, and 1/2 coconut sugar 1/2 regular sugar if you are so inclined to try. I mixed it all with a food processor to make it a bit easier.  I cooked them until they where chewy instead of snappy and my hubby who isn't normally a gingersnap fan really loved these. Chewy is where it's at for him. He says they are his second favorite cookie now, my chocolate chip pudding cookies being #1. I'm always trying to find a way to dethrone #1 because they are so naughty. The quest continues! :)

Really liked this recipe!  I did play chicken and slighted the cayenne amount a little, but the cookie is a step up from the normal ginger cookie.  Will make again!

When I saw candied ginger on the ingredients list I was kind of disheartened. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to find them easily. But I was intrigued by the cayenne and black pepper, and liked that it was a butter as opposed to shortening recipe. Luckily, I found them in the bulk spice section at WinCo while getting the other ingredients. I doubled the cayenne, since I don't have a 1/8 t and figured why not? The cookies turned out great. Very spicy but not too spicy for those of us that love spice. And the candied ginger is really worth looking for! My husband agreed that these are the best ginger snaps we've ever had and I don't believe they could be improved upon!

The best Ginger Snap recipe I have used to date! The only adjustment I made was 1tsp-Cayenne pepper and drop the Black pepper. Easy and fun to make with grandkids! I look forward to many more in 2018. Merry Christmas Chef John, "and as always Enjoy!"

Taste was good but I thought they were a little dry.  Made no changes and they were easy to make.  Will try again.

This cookie is heavenly, at first I used freshly ground cloves, as I was grounding it I found the smell not appetizing and was a little discouraged to use it in my cookies, but apparently it's not a very strong flavor and it gave a nice hint of taste, thank you very much for this recipe and for every other recipe you submit :)

Good flavor but the cookies are dry.  Crispy on outside and chewy on inside.  it tastes like it needs more butter.

I love my Ginger Snaps to have a little 'bite' so I did as others suggested and upped some of the spices.  I used 1/2 c. chopped candied ginger, 1 Tbsp. ground ginger and 14 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Came out great!

They were very good, especially when warm, but when they cooled down they didn't have as much kick to them.  I'll definitely make them again - but crispier next time and with more ginger and pepper!
 Just made them again today - added extra ginger and pepper and boy are they good!!!!!

Has a great spice and pepper flavor.  The crystallized ginger really adds to each bite.

...a good recipe...easy to follow. I made the following changes:
1. added a third more ginger for more flavor.
2. substituted honey for molasses because I didn't have molasses...an O.K. change, but  I suspect molasses would be better.
3. substituted brown sugar for more flavor.

The pepper is a great idea...makes for a good spicy cookie.
