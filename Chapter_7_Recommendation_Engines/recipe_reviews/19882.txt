This is excellent.  I added Oreos to this and made the ice cream in a Cuisinart ice cream & frozen yogurt maker.  The thing I like best about this recipe is the fact that this remains semi-soft and creamy in the freezer, unlike other homemade ice creams which always turn rock hard.  I plan on using this recipe a lot, and I think it is easily customizable to make whatever flavor you want.  I already have plans to add chocolate, strawberries...  All sorts of things!  Thanks for a great recipe!

YUMMY!!!  This ice cream has a dulce de leche flavor, which I loved.  Followed the recipe exactly, and the texture was rich and smooth,  not rock-hard like most ice creams I make.  I made this for my husband, and pledged not to eat any, since I'm low-carbing.  However, this ice cream was soooooo good, that all my low-carb plans went out the window until the entire container was gone.  Highly recommend.

This was SO EASY and tastes GREAT!  Fun to make with my 4 year old.  I can't believe how good it is.  I'd buy this brand if it was in the store.

Super simple & delish! I doubled the recipe & poured it into a gallon sized  ice cream tub that I had saved from store bought ice cream. It was worth the 24hr wait to eat it! Now I'm ready to try adding different flavors/toppings into it! This will be in my favorite recipes from now on!!!

This recipe was so easy, creamy and delicious! I doubled it and I used 1/4 cup of Vanilla flavored Irish Cream liquor instead of vanilla extract. Absolutely to die for! Everybody couldn't stop raving about it!!!

The recipe by itself is a moisturizer for a Mexican Cake called 3 Milks...as an ice cream is not what I expected but I can understand the thrill of other reviews.  This was not the kind of Vanilla Ice Cream I was looking for, but I have to say that this was really easy and quick.

HUGE hit today at our family birthday party. AND, it had wonderful consistency.  (approx 6 hours in freezer after 20 min spin in ice cream machine.) Super smooth, creamy and easy. LOVED IT!

Best I ever made. I didn't have ice cream maker. And I've tried to make 'manually'. Didn't work out. Still icy. But this one, works like magic. Easy and delish. I use dry powder whipping cream. And it makes 2 litre. 1l I made with 1c oreo. It was sooo great. Really like store-bought. I will try another flavour. Thank u so much!

Best Homemade Ice Cream you can find! I have done this in our ice cream maker but most the time I put it in ziplock bags and throw it in the freezer.

FINALLY!  An ice cream recipe W/OUT cooking eggs that is delicious!  I used 8oz heavy whipping cream since I didn't have the frozen stuff, and went ahead and made in my ice cream maker... it was AWESOME. 

I recommend adding just a pinch of salt to the ingredients, just adds that final touch.  

Can't wait to try different flavored extracts and goodies to add in after the whipping/mixing is done.

Our new staple ice cream recipe...Thank you!!

I actually made this in my ice cream maker.  It is great- but even better the next day after being in the freezer.  I can't believe how easy and cheap this is to make!!  It's the perfect texture.  And it does have a dulce du leche taste to it- kinda caramel- like.

This looked too easy to be any good, but I was fooled. It tasted as good, even better than most store brands.  Great, rich flavor and easy to scoop!  I added a few slices of Louisiana strawberries with a little of its juice, and the flavor was wonderful.  Sure beats using an ice cream maker!

Unbelievably easy and delicious. Have made it twice within the last couple of days -- a keeper!  Made it in my ice cream machince; let the beater stir until it stopped on it's own, which was probably 20 minutes or so. Then poured it into an airtight freezer container. Is delicious right away, but we liked best after a couple of hours in the freezer.

Very easy to make, and it tastes like very creamy real ice cream. I added ground ginger in small amounts until I could just barely taste it; it went well with the vanilla flavor of the base mixture.  I'll make this again, and try some different mix ins.

Love love this recipe. Very easy to make! Very delicious and very,very smooth just like traditional ice cream but even better! I use organic ingredients, is my first choice whenever possible. I put my own twist on this recipe, I went into my garden got 4 fresh organic lavender sprigs and after cleaning added them to the evaporated milk. I let the lav. & milk simmer on low for 20 mins. cool, strained & add to the mix. Folding all the ingrs. by hand. with a whisk. Freeze in ice-cream maker container for 1 1/2 hr then fold in graham cracker mix (organic graham cracker, org. butter & org. coconut sugar in a blender to a lumpy crumb texture). It is simply delicious. My selective eaters LOVED it. I also saw & made a mango version to this recipe and that was a hit too. I made it into a mango lassie ice-cream. "It was exotic, devine and heavely delicious," said my hubby. These ice-creams make you feel happy and make you want to dance which works great to burn off the calories. Happy eating & dancing!

I tried this recipe with oreo's and tend to think I put too much in.  It left a harshness in my throat and for some reason the mixture seperated itself when it froze.  Not sure if I will try it again or not.

Overall pretty good.  I found the plain vanilla to be a little bland, so the next batch I added crushed oreos to make cookies and cream.  I am going to try pureed frozen strawberries next time.  Very easy and quick to make.

This ice cream is super easy and tastes very good! The consistency seems to be more like ice milk, but is nonetheless delicious!

It was too sweet and it melted too fast. I gave it a 3 because my son likes it.

To suit my taste I made a few minor changes.Firstly, I increased the sweetened condensed milk to the full can. Then I used 1/3 cup of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa instead of vanilla. 1/3 cup cocoa gives it a "Mild" chocolate taste. Lastly, I added 2 whole eggs. Ya, I know, I'm gonna Die from the raw eggs. LOL. The eggs keep the ice cream from getting to hard. Mine comes out smooth and velvety. I can scoop it out with a silverware tablespoon. BTW, I've made this recipe now six times and never had to wait 24 hrs. Mine is ready in 12 hrs.plus or minus.

In the preperation, I use my Blender to mix the Evaporated Milk, Sweetened Condensed Milk, and Cocoa. I let it rip at full speed untill I see that the Cocoa is totally blended in. Next, I transfer the mix to a large mixing bowl, and fold in the Cool Whip before using my Hand Mixer with Whisk to fully incorporate all ingredients.

After pouring the mixture into the freezing vessel, (A 2 Litre vessel is perfect). if you see tiny air bubbles give it time to let the air escape. I give it a GENTLE stir. I cover it with Glad Wrap prior to placing the air tight lid on the vessel. DONE.
  
In about 12 hrs. you will have a smooth, scoopable,ice cream treat.
Also, a shallow vessel will shorten the freezing time. ENJOY!

This recipe is awesome and so easy to make. I'm going to be enjoying trying different flavors with this. Right now I'm making it with espresso and heath bits. Yum! But the vanilla is fantastic on it's own. Thank you for sharing Denise.

I absolutely loved this recipe and it was really easy to make. Prepared it with my class of 4yr olds who loved the outcome and the fact that they helped make it. We doubled the recipe and added crushed chocolate crème cookies to the mixture once completed, and periodically stirred the ice-cream while it was freezing to disperse the cookies. My go to ice-cream recipe, cant wait to try other flavour combos.

Taste was awesome...personally I prefer my ice cream softer but husband didn't mind.  I think I was slightly harder because of the almond essence I put in and also didn't thaw the cream. I also made it peppermint flavor since it's the holidays and it was ready in little over under 12 hrs...don't think I'll b buying ice cream from now on...gonna try making rum and raisin flavor next!

So fast, easy and tasty!  When it was still soft, I swirled in a little bit of chocolate syrup.  I can't wait to make it again, with fruit or crushed cookies.  Thank you!
