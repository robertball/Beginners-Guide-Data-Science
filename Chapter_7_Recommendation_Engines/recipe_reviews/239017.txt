Great recipe! Very easy to put together and tastes great. I chopped my tomatoes vs. grating and added a little red onion and finely chopped green pepper. I opted out of the onion salt and just used regular. I didn't have canned jalapenos so I used about a Tbsp. of finely chopped fresh. I added a splash of apple cider vinegar and let it set overnight. The flavors blended together nicely. This was very good served with "Baked Tortilla Chips" from this site.

Wonderful!!! Most of it didn't make it overnight like recipe suggested! My family got into it shortly after I made it. The recipe is wonderful as is but is a wonderful base if you like to tweak recipes to your own personal taste. I had fresh tomatoes that needed to be used before they went bad.  Most of my family dislikes tomatoes but when made into this salsa, they were gone shortly  there after!

A great refreshing salsa that pairs well with chips or as a topping for Mexican food. Made exactly as written. No need for changes.
