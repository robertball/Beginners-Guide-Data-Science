I would have given it a five star for flavor alone!  On my second attempt I omitted the egg and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I didn't have a runny pie on the second attempt.  If you cut the butter for the crumb topping back to six (6) tablespoons you won't notice a difference in texture or taste, so save the fat and the calories and cut it back.
Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

This pie is pure heaven. I cut the sugar inside the pie by half and added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. We moved into a house with rhubarb growing in the garden and I had never tried to cook with it before. My husband said it is new favorite pie.

The first time I made this pie I thought it was wonderful. I decided to make another and enter it in my local county fair. I won a blue ribbon (1st prize)! The only change I made was adding a tablespoon of corn starch for thickening. This pie was very easy to make and has an excellent flavor. Thank you for submitting the recipe for all to enjoy!

I added cornstarch as per other reviewers, cut down the sugar to about 3/4 cup, and made my own pie crust. It turned out beautifully and I won my organization's annual baking contest!

This was my first time  both eating and making    a strawberry rhubarb desert. It was very simple and it came out delicious! The only addition I made was to add a little cornstarch for extra thickening, as I have recently had many issues with my pies not thickening properly.

I used both frozen rhubarb and strawberries; I thawed them before mixing them into everything else (it only took about 20 minutes to thaw).  It came out tasting excellent, but I somehow got too much filling in the crust so it bubbled over.  It would have been the perfect amount in a deep-dish pie crust.  The mess was worth it!  This was my first attempt at making a pie from scratch and I loved it...thanks.

Incredible pie!  We bought our new home and inherited a ton of rhubarb in our garden.  This was my first attempt baking with rhubarb and I am very pleased. I did make two minor additions.  I added just a touch of almond extract to the filling and a bit of freshly grated nutmeg to the topping.  I made two pies in the early afternoon and they were set perfectly by dessert!  My dad paid the best compliment - he said my great grandma would really love this pie.  She was very well known for her baking skill so this recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this pie for the first time and got RAVE reviews.  I actually used 1 lb. of rhubarb and more strawberries for a bit more filling and it paid off.  Next time I make it however, I'm going to make it with less sugar, probaly with 1/2 cup sugar instead of the 1 cup, especially if you add more strawberries.  Because of the reviews I got, I'm giving this 5 stars, but I would only have rated it 4 stars for myself personally because I don't like things as sweet.  Great pie in any case!

Delicious! I wasn't quite sure how much rhubarb to add and so I only added less than 2 cups. I could have added more and it would have been fine. Otherwise, it was a great pie. I will definitely make this one again.

I thought this came out pretty well.
I used frozen rhubarb and strawberries and I used 1 tlsp flour and 1 cornstarch.

Excellent!  We used a deep-dish pie shell, otherwise it would have been way too much filling.  I also added a little extra flour and some cornstarch to avoid overly runny filling.  Here's a great tip my mom gave me for cutting in the butter for the topping (works great with sodabread recipes too) - you grate the chilled butter with a cheesegrater, and then mix it in with your fingers.  It is soooo much easier than trying to cut it in with a fork or knife.

This pie is amazing! I just won first place with it at a work pie competition. It won against key lime, apple, and pumpkin. It is THE best strawberry rhubarb pie I have ever had, and many pie enthusiasts agreed! 

I used frozen stwbry/rhbrb (they're not in season). Be sure to thaw completely overnight and drain excess liquid. I added an extra tbs of flour and 1 tsp of corn starch to the fruit mixture to thicken it up (if I was using fresh, I wouldn't change anything). I prepared the crumble top the night before and kept it in the fridge. Put it all together quickly the next day.

This was my first ever Strawberry Rhubarb Pie and it was DELICIOUS!! This recipe is perfect. I followed it almost exactly...just added a tsp. of cornstarch and 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon as others suggested, and baked it for an additional 10 minutes. Excellent with vanilla ice cream and/or whipped cream. YUM!!! I'll be making this again and again! Thanks Paula!

This was quite delicious, but I had to cut the sugar to 3/4 cup--otherwise it was way too sweet for my tastes. It also took a lot longer to bake than the recipe instructs--it took about 65 minutes. It was a huge hit at work, though!

Excellent recipe - next time I will omit 1/2 of the sugar in the filling and add cornstarch to help thicken.  Also, I may try to forgo the bottom crust all together to save calories, making more of a crisp recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I believe this recipe would have been great as is, but since I do not have a kitchen scale, could not weight out 3/4 lb. of rhubarb. So I filled up my 2 cup glass measuring cup with rhubarb and an equal amount of strawberries (i love strawberries), used the full amount of sugar and added a tablespoon of corn starch. I also used heaping tablespoons of flour since I'm sure I had more fruit in the pie than intended. But it comes out perfect. Even though it doesn't have time to 'set', I love eating a piece warm from the oven with some ice cream. Will definitely make this again in the future.

I took the advice of everyone and added cornstarch. I added 2 tsps. Thought this was very yummy! My crust was soggy in the center though, so next time I will par bake it for about 5 mins to prevent the juices from soaking in.

We had this on a hot spring night with homemade whipped cream and coffee -- It was delicious and everyone asked for seconds! I did half the sugar and added almost double the fruit and I think that made it even better! Thanks for the great recipe.

I will never make double crust strawberry rhubarb pie again. The topping was delightfully crunchy.  I did make a slight change to the recipe because of all the reviews talking about runniness.  I omitted the egg and added about 2 Tbsp of cornstarch to the filling.  I also scaled back the sugar by about 1/3 cup.  Absolutley delicious.

This pie is definitely blue ribbon worthy!  I used frozen rhubarb that I thawed and drained (make sure that you thaw the frozen rhubarb and drain it completely so that you don't end up with extra water in the recipe- a good trick is to put the rhubarb into a cloth kitchen towel once thawed and squeeze slightly to extract the extra water).  I also added extra strawberries and reduced the sugar by about 2 TBSP.  Added about 2 tsp cornstarch to the fruit mixture before pouring into the shell to aid it in the thickening process.  Allowed mixture to set about 14 minutes before baking.  It came out perfectly.  This pie is even better after a few hours in the fridge!

YUM!  We haven't had a piece of pie in three months..three long months..three VERY VERY long months..ok, you get the picture! Anyway..I was at Sunflower Market today, beautiful strawberries, great looking rhubarb and at home in the freezer a pie crust...ummm..so I went for it.  My "nanan" used to make these when I was little..brought back some great memories..it is DELICIOUS!!!  The old man had never had rhubarb before and he liked it. Said it was very tasty!  This was our "splurge" and it was a mighty fine one!  Thanks for sharing this with us.

Ignore all reviews under 5 stars.  Best strawberry rhubarb recipe ever!  If you follow the recipe it will not turn out runny, make sure it cools down before serving:)

This pie is out of this world.  I had my doubts, thinking it would be too sweet, runny, or that the flavor of the rhubarb would not come through.  I tried it anyway after reading so many positive reviews--taking the advice of many other reviewers, I lessened the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp cornstarch.  The results did not disappoint.  The pie came out looking perfectly golden brown and smelling so irresistible that it was difficult to let it cool before cutting into it. I was pleased to see that even though it is juicy and the set isn't super firm, it held together well enough to hold its shape and be recognizable as a slice of pie once it was on the plate--which is what strawberry rhubarb pie is supposed to look like; it's not supposed to be jell-o firm. Also, the bottom crust is cooked through but it is a bit paler than I would have liked. Honestly, I'm having a hard time finding anything negative to say. The taste is just unbelievable.  I've baked (and eaten) a lot of pie in my life, and this may just be the best pie recipe I've ever tried.

I took this pie to my church's fall festival baking contest and I won! I'm a young mom with 3 children so when I beat the more experienced bakers, I was shocked. This pie is divine! You can't go wrong with it!

I really liked this recipe.  I used 2 cups of Rhubarb and 2 cups of stawberries.  After reading the reviews I only added 3/4 c sugar and I added 2T of corn starch with the fruit.  I also used 6T of butter in the topping.  We thought the pie was just a bit to sweet, next time I think I will put on a crust top, instead of the crumble top, maybe that will cut down on the sweetness.  It was VERY GOOD, just a bit sweet(I do tend to like things tart).  Was not watery at all.  I will try it again....
We enjoyed it with icecream...

I've made a lot of pies, but never even had a strawberry-rhubarb pie.  I decided to try, and this is a winner! I  did change it a little.  I used 2 T cornstarch instead of flour, and only 3/4 cup sugar.  I didn't measure the rhubarb, 3 medium sized stalks, and most of a 16 oz thing of strawberries.  Didn't quite fill up my deep dish, but with the topping, pretty much did.  
Oh, and I cut in the butter to the topping with a pastry knife.

Very good.  I added a couple of Tbs. of cornstarch to the mix.  I had to cook it a lot longer.  I finally turned it up to 375 to finish the job.  Vanilla ice cream a must with it!  Yummy

Loved it!  I added some blueberries to curb the tartness of the rhubarb.  Both the rhubarb and blueberries were frozen, strawberries were fresh.  I baked the pie a little longer to get rid of the extra liquid.

Perfect just as it is with a little added cornstarch. I made two, baked them and put them in the freezer for later use. I brought one to my in laws for dinner yesterday, thawed and warmed it in a 200 degree oven. It worked beautifully. Definitely a keeper

this was my first pie, and it came out perrrrfect!  i made the filling before i made the crust and i noticed as it was sitting out, the filling became more and more liquid-y as fluids were drawn out of strawberries and rhubarb.  while my pie crust was chilling in the fridge, i strained the liquid from the filling and reduced it on the stove.  let it cool, then added it back.  (even though i was highly tempted to reserve it for spooning over ice cream!)

Wow! This was sooo good! I did add a tsp. of lemon juice to the fruit mixture, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, for a 1/3 of the flour I used w.w (3 Tblsps total, 1 extra then recipe called for). I used the full 1 lb package of frozen rhubard thawed, my strawberries were also frozed but thawed. For the topping I did not have butter so used margarine def would've been better w/butter. I added 1/2 tsp powdered nutmeg & ginger & a full tsp cinnamon. I would def make this again! Thank-you!

delicious. Make sure your rhubarb pieces are small enough. I only sliced into 1/2 inch pieces and they would have cooked more thoroughly if I had diced into 1/4 inch pieces.

Wow. Massive yumminess. We picked up fresh strawberries and a stalk of rhubarb at the local farmer's market this morning and by afternoon we had this amazing pie. My husband, a long-time fan of his grandmother's rhubard pie, loves it! A real hit! Per other reviews, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1T of cornstarch in addition to the flour called for. Perfect. Topping is crunchy, pie held together (sliced when warm), and was just sweet enough to still be able to appreciate the flavor of the strawberries and the tartness of the rhubarb. Enjoy!

I used 1 pound of strawberries, not 1 pint, but kept the rest of the filling the same.   Also we used instant oatmeal, maple and brown sugar flavor.  It ended up being delicious, although I was skeptical.

It turned out to be strawberry-rhubarb soup, but so delicious that nobody cared. I could only find .5 pounds of rhubarb at the store, so I made up the extra with a package of blackberries. Added two tablespoons of cornstarch, as recommended by other reviewers, but still the pie didn't set. Also, about twice as much crumb topping as even an oatmeal'n'sugar fiend like me could have required. Next time, I'll halve it. I suspect the layer of crumb topping on top was so thick that it increased the pie's cooking time, which accounts for some of the soupiness. I'll definitely be making this again to experiment!

This is only my second strawberry rhubarb pie so maybe it's the norm, but it was very soupy but very delcious! I used scottowels to sop up the liguid so the pie wouldn't get soggy.  I'm sure there is a trick out there to fix this :) Didn't affect the flavor though and my Mom said she just licked up the liguid.  She also said it was the absolute best pie she ever had.  Lots of rave reviews....going to keep!!

This was soooo good!  I used about 2 c. rhubarb and strawberries from the farmer's market.  I have to say this is my favorite pie recipe to date!  It just has a great flavor.  I can't wait to make this again!

I used about 75% strawberries to 25% rhubarb.  Very yummy!  I love the crumb topping.  It's definitely easier for novice bakers.

Excellent pie.  I made this in a deep dish pie plate and it could have used a little more fruit.  I will use more Rhubard and Strawberries next time.  Thanks for submitting.

My family loved this recipe. I made it exactly as it was listed but might try less butter and sugar next time as some of the other reviews stated. It set up nice and was great with vanilla ice cream on top.

Excellent pie.  I can never find rhubarb, so I just doubled up the strawberries.  I would probably use 3/4 a cup of sugar the next time, but otherwise, this is nom nom nom nom.

I had never made a strawberry rhubarb before this one.  I did read reviews, so I combined two recipes for filling.  Instead of flour and egg, I used 1/3 of a cup of tapioca.  I also saw that someone only used 6 TBSP of butter in topping.  the pie was delicious.  Reminds me of one my aunt used to make with rhubarb from her garden.

This was my first time every making a strawberry rhubarb pie and the taste was great.  My only complaint was that the filling was still a bit runny even after adding a bit of cornstarch per other reviews.  Luckily I have a husband who simply loves pie and had no complaints from him.

The best strawberry pie I've ever made! I didn't have any rhubard so I just put strawberries. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and in the topping, I cut down the butter to 1/4 cup, really made no difference in taste at all and in fact I only ended up using half the topping thus only about 1/8 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of sugar. Try it out! It's a must. Also, I added 1 tbps of cornstarch as per other reviews. My hubbie and I ate 3/4 of the pie together!!! It's that sinfully good. ;)

This rating is based on a couple of changes.  I used cornstarch instead of flour and omitted the vanilla.  Came out perfect.  Definitely need to let it set/cool before cutting into.

This is one tasty pie! I used about 1/2 of sugar and found it sweet enough. I've tinkered around with cutting back on the butter for the topping and found that using about 6 TBSP is best.

I followed some of the other tips and cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup, added 1 Tbsp cornstarch, and cut the butter back to 6 Tbsp. The taste is awesome, but the bottom of my crust was soggy. I'll definitely par-bake the crust next time. I wonder if it makes a difference if you use a glass or metal pie plate...

Just like the other reviews, I omitted the egg, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and add 1 Tbsp of cornstarch.  For the topping, I used just 5 Tbsp of butter.  4 stars as is, but 5 stars with modifications.

My husband said the best pie I've ever made. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 TBSP of cornstarch and since I had some blueberries that were looking a little sad I threw in about a cup of blueberries. YUMMY! I love the topping.

This was the 1st time I made this kind of pie with a crumb topping. It was a huge success, which is saying a lot since pies are one of my specialties around the holidays. Even my husband, who is picky and doesn't like rhubarb, gobbled up 3 pieces! It was just sweet enough and not runny or soggy. I will use this again for sure!

Amazing!  I used 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of 1 cup sugar and also added a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch as recommended.  Not runny in the least and had the perfect blend of tart and sweet.  I also decreased the butter in the crumble topping to 6 tablespoons per the reviews, but honestly next time I think I'd use the whole amount.  My husband keeps raving about this pie.  I'd never made a rhubarb pie before and this was just delicious.  Will definitely be making it again!

I loved this recipe. I changed it by not adding in the egg. I also cooked the rubarb with the sugar and 2 tablespoons of corn starch and about 1 cup water. then I folded in the strawberries and added the vanilla.

Incredibly soupy, and I even added a tablespoon of cornstarch. The flavor was good, but it was disappointing that it was so incredibly runny. I'd try it again, but with probably 3 T cornstarch and possibly cut out the egg as another poster suggested.

I personally didn't try this pie, I made it for my 96 year old grandmother who LOVES strawberry rhubarb pie.  She absolutely loved it!  I did the cornstarch and reduction of sugar like the other reviews suggested and it turned out great.

I missed the part where you have to bake it for 10 minutes at 400.  I guess that would explain my under cooked crust and slightly crunchy rhubarb and runny sauce.  I still had it in for 45 minutes but at 350.  I'd give this another try; the flavor was good.

This was my first rhubarb pie, have never been much of a fan, but hubby really liked it so I thought I would give it a try. Well I am now a big fan too.  This recipe was EXCELLENT!!  We ate the whole pie, just the 2 of us. Another great one to add to the recipe box.

This was my first attempt at a strawberry rhubarb pie and it came out fantastic! Like other reviewers, I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, added 1 TBS cornstarch, and threw in a few extra strawberries. This is a really good recipe and will make again!

This is quite literally THE best pie I have ever made.  It was so easy and its pretty much impossible to screw it up.  If you arent a rhubarb fan (which i didnt think i was before this pie) you will change your mind after this... guaranteed!  Thanks for the amazing recipe paula!

Terrific! Following reviewers' advice, I omitted the egg, decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, and reduced the butter in the topping to 6T.  I also added a little extra flour to the filling, which helped it firm up nicely. Definitely a hit at my house!

The pie was good but didn't really care for the crumb topping.  Didn't taste like grandmas with that topping.  Overall though my son liked it, don't get me wrong though NONE of it went to waste.  =)

LOVE IT!!  My first try on this type of pie!  I forgot that I did not have any brown sugar so I used crunched up gram crackers and white sugar...was delicious.  I also gave the filling about a 1/4 teaspoon of lemon juice....Let it cool and then put it in the fridge for a nice cool summer treat.......thanks so much for this great recipe!

It turned out wonderful! My husband said that it was the best pie that he had ever had, and he doesn't even like sweets. I will for sure make this again, except cook it a little less longer as it got a bit mushy. Overall, very very good and easy to make!

This was great! I did not change a thing. Once the pie cooled off, in the fridge, it had a thicker sauce. Really awesome, My husband loved it, he does not like too sweet, and I ate plenty myself! I will be trying it again this weekend, no changes!

I did what everyone said, add a bit of cornstarch. This is the BEST strawberry rhubarb pie I have ever made and the crumb topping is simply superb! Combined with an awesome pie crust and you've got yourself an award winning pie. I made this for a few different people this week and every one of them said it was the best and their new favorite pie (and mine too!) Awesome taste, sweet and refreshing with vanilla ice cream. Will and have made time and time again!

5 stars for taste, 4 because there are issues with the recipe.I used fresh rhubarb and strawberries, 2.5 cups of each. I used 6T of flour instead of 2T, but I still got a very runny pie. I think that the baking time is too short and the temp too low. Next time, I will set the pie on the lowest rack at 450 and bake 15 minutes, then change setting to 350 for another 40 - 45 minutes. I will still use the 6T of flour inside the pie. For the topping, I will reduce the butter to 1/4 cup (which is 1/2 stick). With these changes, I think that the consistency will be right. If not, then I'll omit the egg. I left the 1 cup of sugar in. It is sweeter than rhubarb pie usually is, which made me like it better. If you really like the tartness of rhubarb, you might want to cut it back to 3/4 c. Don't forget that the sweet/sourness of the strawberries can also affect the amount of sugar that you add. I used rolled oats for the topping. This pie has an excellent taste. It can easily be a 5 star with the corrections.

Great recipe - I used a little less sugar than called for, and cut down the butter a little on the topping, but all in all stayed pretty close to the recipe.  I used frozen strawberries with fresh rhubarb, and it came out great.  Next time, I'll use a little more fruit.

This pie was very good and many liked it, but even though I cut back on sugar it was sweeter than I like.  I made a plain rhubarb and find that more to my taste.

This was my first strawberry rhubarb pie ever, and it turned out incredible.  My family swears it is the best pie they've ever tasted.  I did add a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken it up on the advice of other reviews

Very tasty!  Followed other suggestions and  reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp cornstarch.  Still seemed a bit soft but very delicious.

i added a bit of cornstarch too, as alot of the other reviews said they did, it was nice and firm, not runny. i used the whole cup of sugar and it wasnt too sweet, what was sweet was the topping, and i didnt use it all, it made quite a bit. i will definitely make it again!

We all loved this pie - a little sweet for our liking so I'd cut the sugar by about half and as per the recommendations I added cornstarch to thicken it which worked really well.  I would definitely make this pie again!

Although the taste was good, the pie was runny and I added an additional two tablespoons of cornstarch and extra flour. It thickened a bit after cooling, but was still runny.

i added some cornstarch as suggested by someone else's comment, and it turned out great.  the only reason that i give it a 4 is because my husband found it a bit too sweet!

I didn't have rhubarb (couldn't find in the grocery store)so I added a bunch of blueberies. It was awesome.  A little runny from the blueberries so maybe I would add cornstarch next time.  This was a big hit.  Will make again and again.

this pie was awesome, and got fabulous reviews at a recent family picnic. its on the sweet side, so if you are less of a sweet tooth you could cut the sugar a little.

My family (and bake sale recipients, friends, neighbors, etc.) LOVE this pie! It's the best strawberry rhubarb pie we've ever had. I've made gluten free by subbing GF flour and crust and it turns out wonderful! I've never had an issue with it being runny or too sweet! The topping is crunchy and sweet and perfect atop the sweet tangy filling.

I added extra cornstarch to the filling, and still found it a bit runny, not in a bad way, just in a warm-filling-mixes-with-melty-ice-cream delicious way!  Overall, great flavor, and looks delicious - got RAVE reviews from coworkers.  Next time I'll add more rhubarb, and hopefully that will cut down on some of the oozing.

I have gotten so many compliments and requests for this pie.  Everyone raves about it.

The only change I make is that I cook it about 20 minutes or so longer than the recipe calls for.  As long as the crust isn't getting too browned, this helps the filling thicken.

Super delicious and very easy to make. I made my own pie shell and followed the recommendations of other reviewers: added 1 tsp cornstarch, used only 3/4 cup sugar in the filling, only 6 tbsp butter in topping. Also added some fresh nutmeg and a little salt in the topping, because I used unsalted butter. Was really tasty! Big hit with our company.

This recipe turned into a soggy, soupy mess. Flavor was good, but sweet. My recommendation would be reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup. And either cook the filling before putting it in the pie shell until the liquid was reduced by half, or adding some ground tapioca powder 1-2 Tbsp before baking.

I made this pie for my husbands birthday and it was really good! Very fresh. Great for summer. I cut the sugar in half and added a little corn starch like the other reviews said. I also added a little cinnamon to the topping. It turned out great and was really easy to make!  I will definitely be making this again.

Amazingly delicious!  I did the same as many others - homemade crust and I added a little cornstarch to the filling.  It tasted almost like a "Strawberries and Cream" pie.  Our family had eaten the entire pie in one day which is amazing.  The last time I made an apple pie it sat on the counter for days until it had to be thrown out have eaten.  This pie certainly didn't last in our house! Delicious!

I made a little adjustment to this and made no bottom to this, so basically it became a crisp and it was awesome, best tasting strawberry rhubarb ever...I also used 2 cups of frozen strawberries I had picked and let them defrost and use them, no difference.

This tasted really good, but it was very runny.  I had to pour the liquid out of the pie before serving and I am sure that alot of good flavor went down the drain.  Next time I will add instant tapioca or cornstarch.

I followed the recipe exactly and got a flavorful pie that wasn't runny at all! I ran out of butter for the crumb topping so I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup cream cheese which turned out quite nicely! :)

This was a great recipe! 
We got some rhubarb in our CSA box and I had never eaten or cooked with rhubarb before.

Based on some of the previous reviews, for the filling I added a tsp of cornstarch and the consistency is perfect. I only used about half the sugar, and I also had a peach on hand so I added that. For the topping I upped the oats to 3/4c and used just under the 1/2c of butter.

YUM!!

Edit: Now that the pie is 1/2 gone, I can see that the bottom crust is still a little underbaked in the middle. I would suggest blind baking the crust for a few minutes.

Going to set the record straight between the variation of reviews. Pie is good, however, you can definitely cut the sugar to 3/4 even 1/2 cup of sugar as it was very very sweet, almost too sweet. Regarding the thinness of the filling, it's all opinion I suppose.. It was a bit juicy, I should have added a bit of cornstarch (which is new to me). 
I follow recipes, not too experienced in straying away from them. With that said, I followed the recipe to the "T" Made it a day in advance and in uncovering it at my Easter gathering the crumb layer was slightly sinking in and my pie crust was soggy when eating it. I would have preferred a thickness to the recipe.
I give this recipe a 3 only because the recipe itself wasn't exactly how I would have made it. I would taken advice from the reviews and had it perfect!

This pie smelled and looked delicious.  I was especially excited about the topping.  Unfortunately, the pie turned out WAY too liquidy to eat even though I added 1 tbsp of cornstarch.  I used fresh strawberries and rhubarb so possibly they were too juicy to use in the pie. If I were to make this again I would probably add much more flour.

This pie is delicious!  I didn't have cornstarch so I added 2 tbs of flour to help thicken the filling but it still ended up being a soupy mess, though it tasted great.  Definitely needs some cornstarch!

Previous reviews were correct in stating that the filling is runny. This was my first attempt at ever making a pie, and I will next time add cornstarch to the filling. Although runny (and ended up looking more like cobbler when served), it tasted GREAT!

We are in the middle of a kitchen renovation, so we decided to try baking this on the grill.  It turned out great!  I used about 4 cups of rhubarb and only a handful of strawberries.  I will definitely make this again!

A really great spring recipe!  Our kids loved the strawberries and crumb topping.  

Per other reviews, I added cornstarch, but it was still a little soupy.  Still tasted great though!

This was a watery mess! cooked it 20 minutes longer than suggested and it came out like liquid. I really wanted this to work. Will have to try adding cornstarch next time. I used all fresh ingredients which may have had too much liquid but this was ridiculous! The topping never got crunchy either and I use a similar one with an apple pie that is amazing. Really disappointing

The pie was good but I ran into a problem because I had to buy frozen Rhubarb (It's out of season here in AZ)as opposed to fresh.  It was very watery but I still got compliments on it.  I didn't take into account the amount of water that would be released when baking.

I've never had rhubarb pie and have only seen rhubarb in the store and my Great-grandmother's  rhubarb patch on the side of her house in the 80's.  Well, after I made this pie I am now researching growing it so I can dedicate a spot in my garden.  The only change was the topping, I opted for a lattice instead of the crumble, which I will try soon as I see myself making a pie a week til I get sick of this unbelievable pie.  Reminds me of eating a strawberry Sour Patch Kid.  Delicious.

Amazing! This is by far one of the best pies I have ever made. I think it is a good 'foundation' recipe to begin with, and I did take the advice to cut back on the sugar and add in some cornstarch (both were necessary). It came out perfect!

I added the 1 TBL cornstarch, but still had to cook it WAY longer.  The consistency was too thick/pastey.  The flavor was average.  The topping never really got crunchy, either.  I won't be making this again

If I could rate this recipe with more than 5 stars I would! I brought this to a family dinner and my father-in-law ate half the pie. No lie! The only change I made to the recipe was that I added one tablespoon cornstarch to the mixture before adding the strawberries to make a thicker filling.

Words cannot describe how good this pie is!  I made 2 of them. One of which a guest threatened to steal, and the other, my husband hid because he didnt want to share anymore.  I added a tbsp of cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers and the consistency was perfect. You have to try this pie.

Perfect recipe. Everyone in my family loved this pie, even my father-in-law who usually prefers more tart/natural-tasting desserts. Just the right blend of sweet and tart.  Strawberry rhubarb pie is a wet pie. The filling spills out and that's okay. It's only grocery store pies, loaded with goodness knows what, that stay in perfect pieces when they are sliced.

I've made this pie about 5 times now and it's always delicious.  I still, after all this time, can't figure out how to keep the liquid down--but I'll keep experimenting.

This is a good pie!  I added the tablespoon of cornstarch for insurance and the filling wasn't too runny.  I will make this one again!

This was so great!  Very tasty!  I had some frozen rhubarb and frozen strawberries that I thawed out and used, I wasn't sure how much to use because I'm not sure how much 3/4 pound rhubarb actually is but I used enough.  The only change is that I added some cornstarch as well, although I wasn't exactly sure how much to put in.  I think I ended up using 2-3 tbsp.  It turned out very well and wasn't runny at all after cooking.  I love the crumb topping, especially with the addition of the oats.  I only used the 6 tbsp. butter for the topping per other reviews.  Will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe; thanks for sharing!  Along with some of the other cooks here, I cut the sugar back a little in the filling, and I also added some spices to the topping.  I loved loved the outcome, especially the filling, and the simplicity of the recipe.

This pie was so easy to make and so delicious! I am not too experienced with baking pies, but it wasn't hard to make. I had to bake it longer than normal because the juices were very runny, but once it was done it was amazing. Almost tastes like cobbler.

I cut the sugar and butter in half and left out the rhubarb (couldn't find any).  But it was still one of the best pies I've ever had.

So easy and so good! Made it for a Harvest Supper and it was the first pie finished off! My family is begging for another one. Used frozen strawberries and rhubarb from this summer's garden and it came out great. I did add a tablespoon of cornstarch, per the other reviewers' suggestion,and it came out just right, moist and not overly juicy.

It takes a bit longer to bake for me, but what a wonderful recipe - we have made it twice and everyone LOVES it, especially my 4 year old son!! The only change for me is I use a refrigerated crust - Pilsbury has the best one and it's delicious!!

This was really a wonderful pie that my family just loved.  The first time I made it it turned out perfectly (although I turned off the oven when it was done and forgot about it for about 15 minutes)!  The second time I made it I took it out when I thought it was done and it was runny... so just a tip to maybe let it cook longer than you think it needs to be.

I made this for Mother's Day and twice since.  My mom LOOOOVED it.  I did need to add a TBSP of corn starch to the mix b/c my berries and rhubarb were VERY fresh and VERY juicy. My grocery store now carries frozen rhubarb so I can make it year round :)

I have to admit this pie was yummy, but it was so runny! I was embarassed when I cut it open and liquid just started pouring out. I may try to play around with the recipe to fix that problem, but I love the strawberry rhubarb crunch recipe from this site so much, I'm not sure I'll try this one again.

This was the first strawberry rhubarb pie I ever made and it tasted amazing.  The crumb topping really gave it a little something extra.  However, the filling was runny, even after adding 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the filling.  My husband managed to drain the juice out and after he did that it was great.  I'll have to think of a better way to thicken up the filling next time.

On taste alone, this is a DEFINITE 5!!!  However, it was pretty runny, so I am giving it a 4. (It did help when I refrigerated it). Next time I will use a little more flour or substitute cornstarch (I find it thickens better). I also added a little cinnamon to the crumb topping.  DELICIOUS!!!!

I made this pie once and the filling was too runny. I would try making this pie again following the recommendation of adding cornstartch to thicken the filling. 

In addition, I only made it with strawberries as filling and it was too sweet with the 1 cup of white sugar. If I were to make it again only with strawberries, I would probably cut the white sugar down to 3/4 or even 1/2 cup.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the mistakes were mine!  I didn't have fresh rhubarb or strawberries (end of summer in Ontario!) so I used frozen...the results were a runny mess.  So I drained off the liquid, put it in a pot and boiled it until it thickened and then poured it over the pie and baked it and additional 15 minutes.  The results weren't pretty but the taste was amazing.  Next time, if I have to use frozen I'll cook the filling a bit before adding to the pie shell.

fantastic recipe! like many people here, i reduced the sugar to 3/4 c., added 2 tsp cornstarch, and doubled the strawberries called for (but i usually use a 10" deep dish pie plate). 

also, if you're using 2 crusts, bake it at 400°F for 45 minutes. (be sure to check it occasionally to make sure the edges aren't burning!)

I followed the recipe exactly and used 2 1/2 cups of strawberries and 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb. It tasted great, but was very runny. It came out more like a cobbler than a pie, but was very good with ice cream.

This pie is really yummy, and I got rave reviews and a clean plate when I took it to a pot luck. I'd never had rhubarb before, so I had no idea what it was supposed to look like or taste like, but this pie is good; a great balance of tart and sweet. I have a deep 9" dish, so I used all the sugar, added a little more fruit, 1 xtra T of flour, and one T of cornstarch for good measure. It was still a little runny, but not enough to keep it from being gobbled up. It didn't last 5 minutes!

I was so excited to make this, but when I cut the first slice it became a soupy mess; it was as if I'd poured a cup of water into the thing.  The flavor, however, was quite good.

This is the first pie I'd ever made.  I followed the suggestions made by others.  So I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 tsp cornstarch.  It's a bit crumbly but I don't care because it's delicious.

This was YUMMY!!  It was a bit runny but I think that is my fault, we ate a piece warm and didn't let it set up completely! My only reason in not giving this 5stars is that I didn't know how much 3/4pound of rhubarb was, so I just added all I had, but probably could have used a little more. The topping didn't crumble for me it was more like a paste but Wonderful taste once the pie cooked, next time I'll add a little more oatmeal to it though. Thank You for this Great Pie, I WILL make it again!!

This recipe was great!  I used 3/4 sugar and 1 tbls more floor.  It was not runny at all. It looks and tastes delicious! There was too much crumble topping so I used it in a little side crumble dessert.

Made for a bbq and everyone liked the flavor, but it was quite a bit soupy and soupier as the night went on.  I tried to add 1 tbsp cornstarch and less sugar.  Would omitting the egg help?  I'd love to make again since I have extra and another bbq to go to.  Advice?  I did add one drop almond extract to filling and finely chopped pecans to topping.

Very good recipe! The pie did come out delicious, and I got very good reviews from all that tried. The pie did not come out runny and was certaintly a hit! I did cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup (this was still plenty sweet...1 cup would be way too much in my opinion) and added 1 tbsp cornstarch which I believe helped prevent the pie from being runny. The only negative I have is that the general appearance of the filling was a bit opaque, which is most likely from the cornstarch/flour combo...maybe next time I will try cutting back on the flour. However, this did not affect the taste at all! Highly recommended recipie, but do consider the changes I have listed as well as others!

Excellent. Cut down the sugar to 3/4 C & added 1 t cornstarch. I used a deep dish crust which is a must! Very bite was perfection. I will make this over & over again. Thanks.

This was my first time making a pie and it was a hit. My husband even said it was the best strawberry rhubarb pie he has ever had. I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup and added extra strawberries for natural sugar. I also put in 1 tablespoon of corn starch. Using 3 tablespoons of butter in the crumble is more than enough. There is no need for a whole stick of butter. I will definitely make this pie again!!

This was a fabulous treat for me to prepare for my family! A neighbor recently gave me rhubarb from his garden and I was reluctant to make yet another disastrous, soupy strawberry rhubarb pie. This recipe helped me conquer my fear of pie baking...it was simple and delicious! I didn't have a pie plate so I baked it in a cast iron skillet. It worked very well. I am thrilled to pass along this fantastic recipe to friends and family. Thank you.

I thought this pie was fantastic. I followed the instructions exactly except for coating the berries and rhubarb in some cornstarch before adding them to the filling. It was the best pie I've ever made, with Pie Crust IV from this site.

This is the first strawberry rhubarb pie I've ever made, and I'm pretty happy with it. The baking time of 45 minutes was perfect, and the rhubarb came out nice and tender. I think next time I'll use a little less flour, because the filling has a bit of an opaque, gluey look to it. It tastes great though!

I replaced the sugar with 3/4 cup honey and switched the strawberries with last years raspberries from the freezer. One on the best pies I have had in a long time. My wife loved it.

VERY VERY VERY good. I am not usually a fruit pie type of person, but I lOVED this one. I did not have any rhubarb, so I used mainly strawberries and some frozen mixed berries. I added some cornstarch to the filling but not quite enough, so the next time I make this I will be sure to add more cornstarch. This pie was a hit with our guests too!

Pretty good, but it was super watery.  The rhubarb was also tough, though it may have been because it was frozen (can't find fresh this time of year).  Next time, I think I will flash boil the rhubarb a few minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this using rhubarb and strawberries from my garden. I also had about a 1/4 cup of raspberries I needed to use so added them in as well. I reduced the sugar to about 3/4 cup and upped the flour to 3T. The filling wasn't too runny and my whole family, even hubby who says he doesn't like rhubarb, enjoyed this with vanilla ice cream. Many thanks.

This was very good. I followed suggestions about adding cornstarch and more fruit, and cutting down the sugar and butter. I had run out of vanilla, so I added some grated orange peel to give it some extra flavor. We really liked the result. Excellent pie! Thanks for the recipe and suggestions.

Excellent pie!  I cut back the suger to 3/4 c. because I like the tartness of the rhubarb but with the strawberries and crumble top I could probably have cut back even more.

This was really easy--I used a ready made pie crust and just whipped up the filling--really easy and good!
