I didn't have pumpkin seeds so I used ground pecans.  The sauce was delicious!  We kept finding other things at the table to put it on.

I made this with pecans instead of pumpkin seeds, as others suggested. It was good, not great. It went well with other foods though, such as french bread (dipped) and on leftover pork chops.

This sauce is delicious!  Perfect for Fall! I toasted the pumpkin seeds first, then I blended them almost to a powder.  I browned the onion, bread and garlic, then added the seed (powder) for a minute.   I blended everything in my blender before heating it.  I wanted it to be a smooth creamy sauce. I also cooked it on med low heat.  It just wasn't getting warm enough on low heat. It turned out great!  I will defiantly make this again. YUM!

I went into making this sauce with high expectations.  I was able to puree my seed mixture all right for a smooth texture, but my cream sauce ended up tasting an awful lot like chicken gravy.  That could possibly be a result of using homemade broth rather than a can of store-bought (which is usually more bland), but it seemed like an awful lot of work to end up with chicken gravy topping my pumpkin ravioli!  Definitely a major disappointment.

  Next time, I'll make either a regular alfredo-type cream sauce or a tomato-based sauce for my pumpkin ravioli.  And if you've not already had it, the pumpkin ravioli is a must-try!

This did need a lot of adjustment to make it much tastier.  I served this with the suggested pairing of pumpkin ravioli from this site.  As one suggested, I substituted pecans for the seeds (I can't imagine the seeds would have produced a good texture for a creamy sauce). I used milk instead of heavy cream (it was still plenty creamy this way).  I used a slice of wheat bread instead of white and I omitted the peppers because we were out of them.  I ended up adding about 3 Tbsp pumpkin puree and about 1 Tbsp tomato puree (I had extra from the ravioli recipe) to try and incorporate some of the flavors of the pasta and also to add flavor to the otherwise bland sauce.  This also helped to thicken the sauce up a bit.  With these adjustments, the sauce was not bad.  The texture is a little odd, but not unpleasant.  In the future I think we'll make the ravioli recipe but use a red sauce instead.  It was worth the work to try the recipe once as-is, though.

Nice flavor, but I'm not real fond of pumpkin seeds.  Next time I'l leave those out, ans the puree, while smooth, still has a grainy/chewy/gritty testure from the seeds...

Well, I had to throw this out.  Some of it maybe user error, but perhaps the directions could be stronger.  1.)  It was way too salty.  This could be because I used prepackaged pumpkin seeds that probably were already salted.  Not stated in recipe, but should use seeds from a pumpkin to avoid this.  2.)  Sauce was chewy.  I tried to toast the seeds before I add the other ingredient, then processed them, but it still came out gritty, not smooth. Not something I could serve.

The taste was good, but we didn't like the texture-too much pulp from the seeds.

I was really excited about this recipe.  I replaced the chicken stock with vegetable stock (vegetarian :-)) and that worked out ok. However, I didn't like the texture.  Too many seed bits.  Perhaps the food processor didn't get it smooth enough.  Was I supposed to toast the seeds before hand?

This recipe was easy to make and received rave reviews.  All of my dinner guests asked for the recipe. This one is a keeper!  I did use all fresh items, not sure if it would have turned out as well had I used canned or dried.

I love this recipe! I use it as a sauce for chicken and vegetables. I used cashew butter and a splash of coconut milk to keep it vegan. I also added cilantro to give it twist. If you have any leftovers I recommend turning it into chicken wraps and using this as a sauce.
