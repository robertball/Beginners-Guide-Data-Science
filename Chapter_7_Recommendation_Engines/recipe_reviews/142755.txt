I was skeptical about cooking this dish with the recipe calling for so many unmatched ingredients, but I did and presented it to my family as a steak recipe. It is edible and all of us finished but left most of the sauce on our plates. I certainly don't want to dicourage others from using this recipe so I am giving it a three. For those who wish a Steak Diane ( named after the Roman "hunter" goddess), use filet mignon rubbed with garlic and crushed black peppercorns and fried quickly, very quickly, in butter; deglazethe pan juices with more butter, finely chopped shallots, heavy creme, beef stock and if desired, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and flambeed with brandy. The sauce is then poured over the steak prior to serving. I serve pommes frites and pea pods to accompany. Bon Appetite.

After preparing and eating this for the first time, my husband told me this was the best steak he had ever had.  Considering that we are competitive cooks and live in a part of the country that is known for its steaks, that is quite a statement.  One recommendation: the recipe calls for "steak sauce"....make sure it is one that you really like because the steak sauce provides a lot of flavor to this the cream sauce.  I didn't use a steak "sauce" at all....I used my favorite steak marinade: Allegro Original Marinade.  Also 1/2 cup of Dijon mustard seems like a lot, so just eyeball it and slather it on to each side of the steak so that it coats each side evenly...like spreading mustard on a sandwich.  I probably used between 1/4 to 1/2 to coat all four sides.

I made this for my husband and mother-in-law they loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the meat did start to get tough when you put it back into the pan with the mushrooms and sauce.  It really only needs to be in there for about 30 seconds. I also had my butcher tenderize the steaks.  There was a lot of the sauce left over next time we will have mash potatoes instead of wild rice.  It is a keeper!

DH is rating this a 5 star recipe.  He absolutely loved it.  All I kept hearing was mm, mm, mm.  I rarely eat beef but I did have a few bites and it was quite delicious.  I think I will cut back on the mustard just a bit next time.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as stated.  Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely delicious and very elegant.  Fine dining at home!  Next time, I will cook the onions a bit longer -- they were not quite soft enough.  Note that I said, 'Next time,' and it will be soon!

I am so impressed with this recipe.  Its better than what I've tasted at 5 star restaurants.  I didn't use the brandy or ignite the sauce, but I don't think you need to.  Excellent!!!!

Everytime I've made this it's been a hit. There is definately a lot of sauce left over, so I always make mashed potatoes with it and use the sauce as a gravy.

This recipe was ok.  Just way way to much mustard for us.  I would use less then half of what it calls for.

My husband said that this was the best steak he ever ate.  Which is exceptional since he is picky about steak!!!  The flames were wild (first time doing that) but this was easy and very good!!!

A GREAT steak receipe. I made 2 minor changes, I doubled the amount of Brandy and also Red Wine and split it between the steak and the cook. I did notice that some of the reviews say use "Tenderloin" instead of Sirloin. An interesting point, Sirloin has a lower fat content than Tenderloin. So for those of us that have to watch the fat intake Sirloin is the best choice.

The sauce was excellent, but why would anyone go through all the work & expense to use sirloin? Use a good cut (tenderloin), and this will get 5 stars.

Outstanding!  Even my picky eater loved this steak.  I used less mustard - I just spread the mustard on the steaks as instructed.  The sauce has a wonderful flavor and would be good on tenderloin also.

This was so yummy!  I didn't think there was any one overpowering taste at all.  The blend of ingredients was absolutely perfect.  I don't have a kitchen mallet, so I used meat tenderizer and stabbed it multiple times with a fork.  I was amazed at how tender the meat was, too!  I will absolutely make this one again...most likely as a dinner party main dish so I can impress our friends.  Thanks!

This receipe would be great without the whipping cream.  I would stop after the flames burn out from the brandy.

My husband LOVED this dish. I actually made the sauce by itself, without the steak. We wanted to grill outside, so we grilled the steak and made the sauce indoors. It turned out great. I will for sure be making this again.

I swopped the red for white wine, as that's what I had in, and omitted the dyjon mustard as I am not a fan. Unfortunately this left it a little bland. I will experiment with some different ingredients but will definately be making this again.

This is good but not outstanding and for the complexity and the cost of the meal I was expecting more. The sauce smelled wonderful and tasted good but to be honest, I liked it better on the mashed potatoes than on the meat!

Ohh my delicousness!  Used half-n-half instead of heavy cream and still fantastic!  Just as good as the steak dianne my hubby used to make for me when we worked at the country club!  My 5 and 7 year old liked it too!  I had to cook my steaks longer because we prefer a more med-well steak.

I wasn't able to make this exactly as it called me to, but was still great and I am looking forward to making it again (with red wine, instead of sherry).  It's a really nice "date" meal.

We eat all dinners from a microwave, due to shift work.  BF "LOVED LOVED LOVED" it.  We did not have steak sauce, so I omitted that.  I covered the beef while it was in the pan the second time.  Came out VERY tender.

I doubled the recipe and had to skip the brandy because I didn't have any but I don't think it made a difference. It was fantastic.Even the kids loved it, They want to know when I'm making it again! I served it with mashed potatos & steamed green beans. It was just perfect.

Mu husband liked this, but I think I might have done something wrong.  The dijon taste was so strong that it tasted like that's all we were eating.  I think maybe I misinterpreted the recipe and put too much.  Despite the strong mustard flavor, it was good.  I am not very good with steak either so mine wasn't very tender.  I will make this again but will use less mustard and pound the meat more, and expect to get better results.  I loved the cream in it.  It was also fun to light a skillet on fire for the first time - it was less frightening than I thought!

This recipe reminds me of how I used to make round steak.  However, tonight I had a sirloin and wanted something a little different. So I gave this a shot. It was delicious, simple, but very flavorful. Every ingredient added it's own special zippidy-do-dah.  Like many reviewers, I didn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing.

WOW!  Just like we used to make it in the restaurant years ago.  Rich and decedent.   Served with white rice with baby carrots and string peas.  Paired this dish with a cabernet sauvignon to absorb the richness of the dish.  We used to make it for our best customers on request only.   :)

Didn't like this at all - would suggest omit the steak sauce & worcestshire or put in small amounts & increase to taste.  Mine ended up way to harsh to the pallet.

I don't know where I went wrong with this recipe, but it just didn't work for us as a family.  I followed the recipe to a tee, but the mix of the wine and cream didn't work and we didn't like the taste. Perhaps it was the wine I used. It was a cabernet, which may have been too strong.

This dish is great and the sauce is absolutely delicious!  My family all enjoyed it and agreed that it could easily pass for a high-end restaurant entree.  My first time doing flambe.  Lots of fun!  I will most definitely make this again!

This was really good and made a great gravy to put on potatoes or rice. Only 4 stars because the meat was still tough, but I let simmer in the sauce for an extra 20 min. and that helped.  Also, the flaming brandy bit made me nervous.  Might try it w/o the brandy or maybe just add a little bit of red wine.  All together it just seem much different than other meat and gravy recipe.  I was expecting more WOW.

Great!!! My family loved this recipe and they are picky, so id say this is amazing. I added just a little more heavy cream, because there wasn't much sauce. And a litle more red wine.  it tastes great.

Although the recipe was a bit more time consuming than I planned for (about 1 hour total from start to finish, including all prep work), it was worth it. My family raved about the sauce. Also..who knew sirloin steak could be so good? I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. This recipe makes lots of extra sauce, so make a side dish that will help use up the sauce (mashed potatoes were perfect)...you will not want to waste it!

This was great.  VERY rich.  Lots of mustard flavor.  I will use a little less mustard next time, maybe 1/3 of what the recipe calls for and we love mushrooms so I'll use an entire 8 oz box instead of 4 oz.  But that's my personal tweaking.  I used Reese's red cooking wine.  I saw another review that claimed the sauce was big mac tasting and I wonder if it got a sweetness due to using a sweet red wine instead of the cooking wine.  What a great winter recipe!

I made this for the saturday night dish with my girlfriend, she really likes it. But there is some part of the recipe that doesn't seem quite right. 1. am I REALLY suppose to put that much mushroom? the sauce ended up being much drier than I expected. 2. The one cup of heavy cream in the end made the sauce taste somewhat like McDonald's BigMac sauce, is this how it SHOULD taste like? or am I doing something wrong?

Lastly, like the previous posts indicated, moving the steak in and our of heat that many times have caused the steak to lost much of its juice and end up being a little over done.

I'd really like to get the recipe of Steak Dianne from the Cheesecake Factory in Marina Del Ray, their chef seems to change the recipe a bit and it taste drastically different then other Cheesecake Factory, also tastes extremely good.

I used capers instead of mushrooms because I don't like mushrooms. If you do this, cut the time in half for cooking the capers instead of mushrooms.

Really, really excellent. My first ever attempt at a flambé and I didn't burn the house down. I added a little green onion at the very last second, but other than that, I followed the recipe. I used Omaha Steaks sirloin. There was plenty of sauce, so we served it over mashed potatoes with roasted carrots.

We loved this dish.  Like others, I reduced the Dijon to just a "squirt" on each side of the meat spread with the back of a spoon but otherwise followed this recipe exactly. I cooked the meat 1 min. per side at each point and it was perfect.  Definitely a keeper.

This was fantastic! My steaks weren't too thighto begin with, about an inch, so I skipped pounding them and they were great! I also didn't have steak sauce so added a little extra Worcestershire sauce and wine, and added the whole bag of sliced mushrooms (about doubled) . Had it with arugula salad and a glass of Pondl Barbera. Perfect!

I did only four stars because, though the flavors were perfect, I couldn't get over the fact that the milk curdled. I'm sure it was something I did wrong, but ended up having to rinse off all the onions, garlic, etc… and starting over with the sauce.

Pretty Amazing!  This was my first experience starting a kitchen fire intentionally.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  This recipe is not for the "sit and watch it simmer" crowd.  It will keep you busy, but there is a nice payoff.

Followed the recipe fairly closely but used Cremini instead of button mushrooms.  Did not find there was too much sauce but Ireally ladled it over the steaks.  
Definitely will do this again and would serve to company in a heartbeat as I could still cook and visit at the same time!

This was great. I doubled the amount of meat,and made 4 servings. I did not double the ingredients though. I used 1 1/4 amounts. Just perfect. I also decreased the amount of dijon mustard.
