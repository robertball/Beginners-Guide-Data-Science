These cookies are freaking awesome. Adding an additional 1/2 stick of butter and 2 tablespoons of milk makes them super fluffy and chewwwy. They come out rather flat otherwise.

These cookies are the bomb!  I'm sure I'll make them again.  My mistake was in storing them in Tupperware which softened the perfectly crispy edges.  Say it with me now:  Tupperware for chewy, tin for crispy.

I love this recipe. This cookie is my back-up recipe for any event or family gathering. I do change the recipe a little because they tend to be a little greasy. I use half shortening and half butter instead of all butter and reduce it by at least a 1/4 cup. Also I add more coconut and instead of all semi-sweet chocolate chips I use a variety of whatever kind I have on hand. I usually use a mix of milk, white, butterscotch (i think the butterscotch really brings out the best in the cookie) and semisweet chocolate chips. I also add a little spice like nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, almond extract, or whatever sounds good. Enjoy.

I don't usually give a recipe 5 stars unless I love it.  These are fantastic!! And sooooo easy!  I had to adjust the sugar because all I had was sweetened coconut.  I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 brown and they were perfect.  Thanks!

I hate coconut. Hate it with a passion. But someone at work asked me to make a cookie with coconut in it.   I picked this recipe, and I think I am the one who ate the most of them!
Easy and delicious.

I LOVE this recipe! It tastes so yummy its crazy! I originally wanted to bake just a regular chocolate chip cookie recipe ...but I looked and looked for one that was low in fat and calories...this recipe was fairly low compared to the rest. But after I started making the cookies I relized that I had no semi-sweet chocolate chips...only buterscotch...so I used those instead...and WOAH! They are the BEST COOKIES EVER!! Yeesh they were very yummy and I have to stop myself or I will eat them all! They taste good with a nice COLD glass of milk or coffee!

These may be my favorite cookies of all time!  If you like chocolate and coconut together, I think you'll love this cookie.  The ingredients are really fattening (and I make it worse by adding a bit more coconut), but so moist and delicious.  I've made them for family members and they still are raving.  I sometimes struggle with baking cookies for the right amount of time, but these are difficult to mess up.  They taste great a bit underdone and a bit overdone as well.

I made these today and they are great. I only used 1/2 cup of each white and brown sugar and they were plently sweet.  I also added an additional 1/4 cup of flour, so 2 1/2 cups total so they would be fluffyThe coconut and chocolate combination were great. This is my new favorite cookie.

these are awesome!  I didn't have unsweetened coconut so I cut the sugar in half.  And I also used a vanilla bean instead of the extract.  great flavour!  Next time I will use some oats to give a bit of texture.

Fantastic! I was worried that there was too much flour when I was mixing, but they cooked up perfect. Maybe next time I'll use choconut extract instead of the vanilla. Mmmmm, choconut and chocolate are the best.

VERY yummy cookies, i halved the recipe and didn't have enough chocolate chips so i also added peanut butter chips and butterscotch. I am glad I did, the peanut butter chips taste amazing! I recommended them :) this is a great recipe, i will be making these again.

These were excellent! Used mini chocolate chips and also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Awesome!! And, a note about flat cookies - you don't need more butter. Just be patient and wait for your butter to really soften. If it's too hard or too liquid (when you put it into the microwave to speed up the process) it won't cream nicely with the sugars and become fluffy.

These cooked 10 min for me; they were soft in the middle and crispy on the edges (in other words, perfect.)  I loved the coconut and chocolate mix.  I made it exactly as described, except that I threw a handful of copped almonds into half of the dough.  Also, these made almost twice as many cookies as the recipe indicates - I'm glad I halved the recipe!

These cookies were awesome with some minor changes.     For more coconut flavor I used coconut extract instead of vanilla. For additional moisture I added 2 tablespoons of milk and 1/4 cup butter flavor Crisco. I reduced the white sugar by 1/4 cup. In place of 2 cups flour used 1 cup flour, 3/4 cup quick oats and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. I replaced one of the cups of semi-sweet chips with butterscotch chips.  Increasing the cooking to a total of 13 minutes completed the entire process to make these cookies perfect. (Hmmm, maybe next time I'll add nuts)

Took these with us to a friends for dinner last night..they vanished off the plate!  Good solid recipe, and I think you could add to it according to your liking.  Next time, i will add a little oatmeal for some texture, and a little extra coconut so the flavor really comes through.  Thankx!

These are awesome cookies! I live at a high elevation so tweaked the recipe a bit. I added 2 tbsp flour and 2 tbsp milk, baked for 13 minutes and they were perfect! Chewy and crunchy...not one went to waste!

I made these cookies for a 4th of July potluck. They came out great... I added 1/2 stick butter and subbed almond extract for the vanilla. I also added 2 tablespoons of almond paste. I could barely get them in the oven the dough was so yummy!!!

These cookies were excellent. I had leftover coconut from another recipe and just had to pick up some semi-sweet morsels. 
I added 2 Tbs of Milk based on other reviews which seemed to make them very chewy, which is how we like them. 
I'm not sure if it was the cookie sheet I used or what, but I needed to cook them an additional 2 minutes from the 10 minutes. =/ 
Other than that, they turned out perfect...

These cookies were delicious. Some changes I made: substitute Pamelas Gluten Free baking mix for flour and baking powder/soda. Also I only had about 3/4c of white sugar so I used some powdered sugar for the rest. Also I beat the eggs with a little milk before addin them. They turned out great and gluten free!

These were just okay for us.  I love coconut, and I love chocolate chip cookies, but these just didn't "wow" me.  I ended up taking the majority of cookies to work, and they still didn't get eaten.

Perhaps I was expecting too much from all the rave reviews, but I found these very ordinary. I wish I would have just made plain chocolate chip cookies and saved the coconut for something a little more special. Tasted yummy, just not the special, different recipe I was hoping for.

Couldn't find Flaked Coconut anywhere, so I used Thread Coconut instead. Turned out pretty good. They were all gone within 24 hours!

Although I normally am not a coconut fan,  these cookies are the best! Wonderful flavor and texture. I lowered the oven temperature to 350 degrees and baked for 8-9 minutes.

We liked the flavor of these cookies, but the texture not so much. We're not fans of cake-like cookies. But, it's a personal preference, so if you like soft, cake-like cookies, you should like these.

If I could give this 6 stars, I would. These are by far the best cookies I have ever made or tasted! I followed another reviewer's instructions of adding two tablespoons of milk and an extra 1/4 cup of butter to make them more fluffy. I didn't want flat cookies - I've had that problem a lot in the past. I also just threw everything into one bowl and mixed it all up at once. If you undercook these, they are still great. If you overcook them, they are still fantastic. They remind me of macaroons. I'm not sure if I will ever try another cookie recipe again.

I adjusted the recipe just a little bit b/c people said that the coconut flavor was a little "weak".  SO I replaced 1/4 C butter with 1/4 C coconut oil.  It gave it that little extra kick.  But next time I think I'll use  a little more flour, as my cookies turned out flat.

I really like these, what a terrific combination! I added coconut cream to my cookies after reading that the coconut taste is mild. I may add more coconut cream or coconut extract next time, I highly recommend this recipe.

so good that my roommate assumed I had bought them pre-made.
I fell short on the coconut by one whole cup and the chocolate chips by 1/2 cup, but they're still delicious.
I'll be making them again for sure!

Yummy!  I used margarine instead of butter, and substituted the white sugar for Splenda.  I also mixed in 1 tbsp of almond milk with the vanilla.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They are nice and light, and not too rich considering they have coconut in them.  They are a bit more buttery than other chocolate chip cookies, but I certainly wouldn't call them greasy.  This is going in my recipe book!  Thanks!

Really good cookies! I decreased the flour just a touch in each cup and followed the rest exactly. They turned out chewy and delicious! Even people who say they usually HATE coconut, said there's something about these cookies that makes them crave them!!
Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

This was my first cookie I ever baked from scratch. OMG! I should tell ya.. it was outta of this world. YUMMM! I just forgot to measure my coconut and chocolate just eyeballed it and it was perfect. I didnt have butter so user clarified butter (ghee) instead which was perfect. I just tweeked a little bit. Added a packet of hot chocolate powder to give it a little color and taste and added few drops of water to make it gooey.  I wish there were 10 stars.. coz 5 is just not enough for this recipe.

I thought this recipe was fantastic but I tried it with imitation rum instead of vanilla extract it it just makes it that much better.

These are sooo good! The coconut flavor is subtle, but I love the added texture in a chocolate chip cookie. This and the Nestle chocolate chip recipe are my go-to's for yummy, easy cookies.

I make these with white chocolate chips and they are fantastic! I always get great compliments. Its a really great twist on a chocolate chip cookie. I love how they balance the sweet with a little salty. Excellent!

The flavor was amazing for these cookies, but they turned out really really flat & the texture just wasn't right.  I was really hoping I could get these to turn out because they tasted so good!  Maybe they need more flour, i'm not too sure.  I did halve the recipe, not sure if that made a difference.

These are addictive! I did not have even a whole cup of the chocolate chips so threw some Hersheys Kisses in themini chopper and added them to make a little over 1 cup. Will make this again and use the 2 cups of semi sweet chocolate. I used sweetened coconut and still used all the sugar the recipe called for and it was fine! This is a very rich, moist cookie. I am planning making them to give as Easter treats!

These are, as other reviews have said, completely addictive.    A great variation on ordinary chocolate chip cookies.   And they are very, very easy and quick to make.    The coconut keeps the cookies moist so you have that "soft" cookie texture you can't always get with other chocolate chip cookies. Kids begged for another batch as soon as the first one was gone.   Great recipe -- thanks for sharing!

These cookies were pretty good. My husband even liked them and he doesn't prefer coconut. I think I might add nuts next time, I thought they were lacking some texture.

I hate myself for finding this recipe, since it's so good I make these cookies too often and then gorge myself on them. They are outstanding.  I follow the recipe exactly, except use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, I think it adds a little something extra.  Even my friends who dislike coconut said they love these cookies, they don't taste too much like coconut, just add enough texture and flavor.  Even the batter tastes great!

This is now my favorite cookie recipe!  So easy and delicious!  I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet, added about 1 cup chopped pecans, and drizzled them with white chocolate after they were baked.  Out of this world!

The best cookies ever...my daughter and I made these and they were great! I cut the sugar in half for both white and brown, instead of semi sweet I used milk chocolate chips. Double the coconut, I highly recommended it.

These turned out absolutely scrumptious (and addictive)!  I've made them once for the office and once for home, and each time they were devoured by all quickly.  I did have to watch them closely in the oven though, because they will burn & flatten...must be the coconut.

Very very tasty and great consistency.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I was expecting to taste the coconut more, and I didn't taste it at all except the texture.  I will try adding coconut extract next time.

These were good, but not fantastic.  I am not a great baker, so it could definitely be me.  But these just tasted mostly like regular chocolate chip cookies to me.  Only a slight coconut flavor.  I added about a half cup of diced walnuts as well (made the dough a week ahead of time).

I think these cookies needed way more coconut then specified.  To me they just tatsed like chocolate chip cookies.  Next time I will add more coconut and cut out some chocolate chips.  Maybe some coconut extract would work too. I also had to bake longer than stated in my oven--about 11 minutes.  Will try again though with those changes.

AWESOME cookie - I cut the chocolate chips half and used 1/4 cup more of coconut - makes for an awesome "less chocolatey" cookie.

Thanks!!

I halved this recipe and substituted the vanilla extract with almond.  I also chopped the coconut flakes in a food possessor.  They came out super soft and chewy, best right out of the oven or even microwaved later!

These were fantastic. Since I like the idea of coconut and chocolate just a little too much, for my sake I halved this recipe. The result was crispy, chewy yuminess. My oven is a bit on the hotter side, so I only needed 8-9 minutes for a batch.  Will definitely make again, maybe adding just a hint more coconut next time.

This recipe is great, and so adaptable! I made it "straight" the first time, just to get a feel for it and the cookies flew off the plate. I changed it to make a more tropical version by using white chocolate chips instead of dark and adding chopped macadamia nuts to the mix.

These cookies are good, however I was hoping for a bit stronger coconut flavor.  Next time I may try adding coconut extract and I would also like to try adding some chopped pecans.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Reena B.

My husband, kids and all of our friends call these cookie CRACK COOKIES.  They are amazinly delicious!  I have made them with store brand coconut and bakers and they are much better with the bakers, it is much more moist.  Thank you for sharing this!!

This was nice and chewy but remember not to overbake if you're going to leave it on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes to cool.  Next time I'll cut down the coconut to 1.5 cups and maybe toast them.

DELICIOUS flavor, but they were a bit greasy (will prob try margrine next time) & they came out flat; still very moist, with perfectly crisped edges. I will definitly make again! Made them yesterday and there is none left after packing school/work lunches today :)
Thanks

Super good cookies! I would recommend these highly!

Second time I made them I added oatmeal for half of the coconut, and it was divine!

You must try these! It's true, even coconut haters like these!

This recipe is GREAT!!!  I made them as vegan cookies and used ground flax seed/water in place of the egg, dairy/egg/soy free semi-sweet choc chips (only half of the bad) and Earth Balance Vegan Butter Sticks.  No one could tell the difference!  They are still a bit too sweet for my liking so I will probably reduce the sugar by half next time.   All in all, great recipe!

These cookies are very good. Unfortunately, you can't really taste the coconut. If I make these again, I will increase the coconut by at least 50% and add coconut extract.

These are the best cookies I have ever eaten! I make them for every occasion. I like softer cookies as well as cold cookies (it sounds strange I know). So, I under-bake them a little bit and store them in the fridge. The texture of the coconut and chocolate is wonderful.

AWESOME cookie! I changed the vanilla extract to almond extract because I was in an Almond Joy sort of mood and it turned out great! Watch your time in the oven very closely. These have a tendency to dry out if you aren't careful. Oh and I used dark chocolate chips instead of the semisweet and wasn't disappointed! Thank you for a GREAT recipe. :)

My children and husband loved these cookies! I added coconut extract as a few other reviews suggested. I baked these tonight as a test to see how they would turn out - I will be making 15 dozen for a cookie exchange this weekend.

These cookies are  simply delicious...moist, delicious & very pleasing. I made them smaller than an average cookie & they turned out being a quick sweet bite for those sweet tooth cravings. I did not put as much coconut as the recipe called for but that was on preference.

Good cookies- made a few adjustments based on reviews and what I had on hand. Used 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, toasted sweetened coconut flakes. and 1 tsp coconut extract. They were just a tad too "cake like" for my taste, I like flatter, gooey cookies. But good overall!

These cookies are top of the line tasty.   Every time I make them, people are asking for the recipe.  These are my "go to" cookies for just about every bake sale and my stuff is always gone.  They are delicious - the coconut and chocolate chip combo is heavenly!  Thanks for an amazing recipe!

-I used both semi sweet and milk chocolate chips.

-Also, I made them JUMBO. Just use a 1/4 cup and bake it at 14minutes. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. DO IT :)))).

These are our favorite! I added about 1/2 c each of walnuts and raisins. Been baking for my husband and I regularly the past year and these are the best so far. Yummy! probably will never make plain chocolate chip cookies again.

These are my favorite. Surprisingly, the recipe is EXACTLY the same as the one I cut out of a magazine and taped into my 'best-of-the-best' recipe book about 8 years ago. Hmmm, maybe the cook published it in print before posting it here. Regardless, they are deelish!

Awesome cookies, thank you!  I modified the recipe a bit too.  First of all, like others, I have an unused bag of shredded unsweetened coconut to use up (Nirav brand, used in Indian cuisine).      I altered the recipe as follows:    I used 2 cubes of margarine (Nucoa and Earth Balance)    I used 1 cup of turbinado-style sugar and omitted the brown sugar    I used about the equivalent of 2 eggs, substituting Nulaid egg substitute/egg product    I used 1/2 of a 6.8 bar of Hersheys Special Dark chocolate (net used 3.4 oz) - I grated 1/2 of the "half bar", and then chopped the other 1/2 of the "half bar" with a chopper blade, in lieu of chips(adding shredded chocolate made the batter darker and denser)    I also added about (did not measure) 1/4 cup of agave syrup, which is a healthier sweetener than regular sugar and fills in for flavor in lieu of the molasses in the brown sugar.    I was going to add a teaspoon or two of Malibu coconut flavored rum, but I did not after all (next batch I will try it!)    I baked them a big longer than suggested because my cookies were rather big.  They came out super chewy and delicious.  I overbaked the second tray and they were a tad overdone and less chewy.      Thank you again for a fantabulous cookie!

This is by far one of the best cookies I have made/eaten. I made it as directed, the only substitution was mini chips instead of regular size. (It was what I had.) Used this recipe to "get rid" of some coconut I had in the fridge, but will definitely make again! I cooked for 7 minutes and they came out bottoms brown and soft and chewy delicious.

Very tasty cookies, but I gave it 4 stars because I had to add some modifications.  First, I used an entire bag (the small bag) of coconut to give it more coconutty flavor. Because I could only find sweetened coconut, I went down on the white sugar and only used 1/2 cup. I added an extra 1/2 stick of butter and about 4 tbsp of milk to make it a fluffier cookie. The results were FANTASTIC! I also used mini chocolate chips.  Without the extra coconut, though, the cookies would've been too overwhelmed by chocolate; I agree with many of the reviewers. I'd give this 4.5 stars, if possible.

They were okay. I can't really taste the coconut; the chocolate definitely covers that up.  Mine didn't really flatten like other reviews, but I didn't mind.  I pressed down on the balls of dough for the second batch and that fixed the problem.

Great recipe - I did add quick oats (1 cup) and reduced the flour to 1 3/4-2 cups.  Also, I switched the amounts of the sugar & brown sugar...just a personal preference.

I made these for Christmas and they were the first cookies to disappear from the cookie tray. Even 2 self-proclaimed coconut haters liked them. They were delicious- very soft and chewy. I decreased my white sugar to 1/2 cup since my coconut was sweetened, but I left everything else the same. I might toast the coconut next time for more flavor because I thought they could have been more coconuty. Still wonderful either way!  *I forgot to mention- aside from the white sugar, I used the exact serving size for ingredients, which should have yielded 72 cookies. However, this recipe only made 3 dozen cookies. I didn't make them very large either- they were about the size of a chips ahoy cookie. Just thought it was worth mentioning.

These cookies are SOOO Yummy!!  I really wanted them to be more chocolatey like in the picture so I added chocolate syrup to the batter and it makes them super chewy and really good - we do like it both ways though!  Really good.

Very dependable recipe.  I've done white choc chips with it, used half wheat flour, and even added a half cup of oats and no matter how I change it, the cookies are always perfect!  The coconut's key.  Thanks!

These cookies are a hit! I added 2 Tablespoons of Milk, 1 c. Pecans, only did 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar because I had sweetened coconut. They were the lightest and fluffiest cookies I have ever eaten. I accidentally added an extra half cup of coconut but the result was still great.

I have a similar recipe (1/2 recipe)
About 1/2 C. coconut (it may not give flavor but makes it sweeter, so I use less white sugar.  I like the idea of oatmeal.  I also bake the half recipe in a 9 x 13 pan (lined with wax paper) for bars.  350º 8 - 10 min.  Same could be used for full recipe but longer baking time.

My family and myself ADORED these cookies! My husband was even so proud, he took a batch to the guys in his platoon!
The only adjustment I made was adding a half cup of butter more and a 2oz bag of split almonds! Yummy and fool proof to make!

Not sure what the big deal is about these cookies. They're just sortof blah. Can't taste the coconut, and they looked nothing like the picture - totally flat. I suppose you could up the flour to get them a little fatter, but for me, it's not worth making them again. No one liked them. Shoot!

Very good recipe.  Coconut was a nice way to spice up the original chocolate chip cookie.  I'll try different types of chips next time for some variety.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The cookies looked good, and the coconut helped the cookies to stay nice and chewy even on day 3. But the flavor just wasn't satisfying, which is why there were still many of them sitting around on day 3.

I tweaked this recipe a bit according to other reviewers' suggestions. I cut the butter by 1/4 cup and added 2 tablespoons milk. They ended up fluffy and just right. My son, a huge coconut lover, said these could have used more coconut. So I'll make them again adding another 1/2 cup or so.

this recipe was excellent!  we added a packet of quaker maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal after we folded in the chocolate chips and coconut.  our oven was more like 12-14 minutes for baking time on a middle rack.  couldn't stop eating them!  do wait for them to cool before you set them on the wire rack, they do need to set.  this is a great recipe to tweak with the ingredients in your own cupboard.

Good Grief!!! These are so yummy!!! I followed the recipe as is with NO substitutions. They only made 4 1/2 dozen for me, however I did eat alot of raw cookie dough.....Just a personal point - I really believe that real vanilla makes a difference in most recipes. I find it is worth the extra $$.

Very, very easy to make! However, it does not make as many cookies as it says, I made half the batch and it barely came out to 20 small cookies. I also used white chocolate instead of semisweet, and they are delicious! I am eating them fresh out of the oven! I will definitely make these again!

This is the fisrt recipe I tried, I am not a baker/cooker. Once I saw this I knew I wanted to try it. And WOW my whole family loves it. They can't stop eating the cookies. I changed the butter amount 1/2 butter and 1/4 shortening so they weren't to greasy. My family is begging for more!!! Great and easy!

This is a keeper. I wanted a chocolate chip cookie and what I got much so better. We made only half a batch and the 36 servings turned out to be 24 good sized cookies. I will have to make more today. Kids left me 4 and a half a glass of milk.

I made these cookies for a housewarming and everyone kept raving about them!  They were the perfect consistency (soft and chewy).  I also mixed butterscotch and semisweet chips together and found that the butterscotch chips really did bring out the best in the cookie (and I think I could have even gone without the chocolate!).  Adding a teaspoon of coconut extract and dashing in some cinnamon and nutmeg really helped enhance the flavor as well.

A marvelous cookie! My husband loves Almond Joy candy bars so next time I am going to add some toasted almonds to it to see if that passes the husband test. Bet it will! I used those good sized Baker's dark chocolate chunks.This is a winner!

Ahhh-mazing!  I substituted out 1/2 cup of butter for coconut oil to give them a little more chewy/moist texture.  They are kind of a "flat" cookie which I'm not usually a fan of but these were so good I wouldn't even try to change anything else.  I've made 2 batches of these so far and every time I give one to somebody they ask for the recipe!

Changed this version for a little  healthier version.
Used 4 tsp ground flax meal, 1/4cup whole wheat flour. Used 1/2 cup of white sugar. 
Dark chocolate chips. Organic unsweetened cacao powder(for added protein 6g) and organic flaked coconut.  I did have to add 2 mins cooking time. Very tasty treat without the guilt.

This was the first time trying this recipe. I only had 2/3 cup of white sugar, so I substituted the rest for light brown sugar. I should have portioned it into smaller portions on the baking sheet. The cookie has a nice outer crunch and is soft and palatabley chewy in the inside. I also used bitter sweet chocolate, so as to have a nice balance with the sugar. Looking forward to trying this again.

Wow, a keeper for sure. I substituted some grapeseed oil instead of the egg yoke and it was incredible! I also used mini chocolate chips. Not too sweet of a cookie! Just perfect. The coconut is an amazing texture I just love em!

I was looking for something a little bit different than the usual chocolate chip cookies.  These fit the bill and they are scrumptious!  The only change I made was to use 2 1/2 cups of coconut instead of 2.  They have a nice chewiness to them.  I also had to bake several minutes longer than called for.  Maybe I made extra large mounds of dough but I just kept checking on them and took them out of the oven when they had browned up - maybe an extra 4 minutes or so.

Awesome. Was a bit short on coconut so used 1/4c oatmeal to make up difference. As another user suggested, used 1/2 butter, 1/2 marg.  Convect baked at 350 for 9 min., 2 sheets at a time on parchment paper.  May need to make again in a couple days. Kids love them!  Hope their dad gets some after work...

I liked these cookies. I found that they turned out best for me when I refrigerated the dough before baking. Because they have a tendency to turn out flat it is best to follow the directions to drop the cookies onto the baking sheet without pressing down on them.

These are delicious. Made them for a cookie exchange, and everyone was RAVING about them. Tiny changes that I think keep to the original recipe, but up the flavor factor. Toast the coconut, and use good quality dark chocolate chip (I used ghiradelli 60% cocoa). Otherwise followed the recipe. This is my default chocolate chip recipe now!

This is my go-to choc chip cookie recipe! Very quick, easy and forgiving.  Sometimes I use semi sweet sometimes milk choc... I usually add a little less coconut so my kids can't detect it, even people who don't like coconut love these ~ you can't really tell it has coconut unless you know.  Great texture! I almost always use coarse sea salt and that really brings a lovely contrast to the sweet cookie.  Definitely a keeper ~ make them all the time ~ YUM!

I am on the fence about this recipe.  I made it exactly and using fresh ingredients and thought the batter was a little dense and dry and didn't work like cookies usually do.  Possibly scaling down the amount of coconut and flour might have helped.  The saltiness also was a bit too much for my liking.  I ended up lightly rolling the batter into balls and then flattening them so they would evenly bake.  They baked okay and the taste is really good.... they were enjoyed by those who ate them including me, so were still a success.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of  adding butterscotch chips because I did not have regular ones.  They turned out very well, nice and chewy.  The cooking time was perfect for me as well.

I really enjoyed making these cookies! First of all, they were fast and easy to prepare! While baking them, I baked about 12 on a cookie sheet and another 12 on aluminum foil (on top of a cookie sheet). I placed the remaining amount of dough into the freezer to save for later. Well the cookies turned out amazing! I am going to have one soon with a cup of milk! Thank you.

THIS is going to be my claim to fame at the kiddies school. I made them with different chips and added a bit of milk. They were even better in the days that followed (even though we were conducting portion control b/c everyone wanted them but also wanted them to last LOL).

Really good cookies.  Made the recipe as printed and I thought the cookies turned out perfectly.  I baked mine for 9 minutes, so the edges were a nice golden brown but the centres were still soft and chewy.  My husband gave them two thumbs up and informed me that he "loves coconut."

I was looking for something a little different, but with coconut, and I stumbled on this recipe. Great recipe. It turned out great. I only made 2 dozen so far, and I've probably got another 3 dozen left in dough for later in the week.  I followed the recipe, except I didn't measure the chocolate chips and coconut...but was close enough. These are a keeper for sure!

These were absolutely amazing! I'm not that big of a fan of coconut, but these were perfect!

No changes here, though I do agree with the leaving on the pan for five minutes. They seemed very under cooked until I let them sit for a bit, but they were perfect.

Good recipe. Becomes GREAT when you toast your coconut in the oven as it is preheating (just till 50% or so is a nice golden hue) and use less sugar. If you have an oven that runs hotter or tends to be less consistent (like mine) just reduce the heat and cook a bit longer, these cookies turn out great either way :) Also, 1 1/2 cups of choc chips is PLENTY as this is a pretty sweet cookie.

Excellent!  I used 1/2c butter and 1/2c extra virgin Coconut oil.  It's healthy and adds a little more coconut flavor.  I also added toasted almond slivers just because I had them.  These were a big hit at the birthday party I took them to.

These were very good, and a bit more cakey than I anticipated - probably because I used light butter instead of regular.  I was going to use them for a cookie party contest, but changed my mind because while they taste great, they weren't "pretty" enough.

Great recipe! Only change made is cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup as I used sweetened coconut like (as suggested by another reviewer). Also added walnuts.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I had a craving for some sort of coconut and chocolate chip cookie and this did quite well. Unfortunately, I didn't have brown sugar and I was able to use some maple syrup and white sugar as a substitute and they still came out pretty good. I cannot wait to try them with the real ingredients. Thanks!

I really like these cookies. It's really just regular chocolate cookies with coconut in them. I added nutmeg and cinnamon. I used crisco instead of butter for fluffier cookies.

I love, love, love these cookies!  I added 2-3 cups of macadamia Nuts.   I made them for a Birthday party at work and everyone asked me for the recipe.  I made them a lot larger, a litte smaller than a baseball, and cooked them for about 20 minutes.

I waited far too long to make these cookies--it has been filed away in my recipe box for years. Unfortunately, many coworkers do not really care for coconut...and I don't want to eat them all myself! --Made recipe as written and they turned out wonderfully. They have the wonderful, chewy texture of a great chocolate chip cookie with this much-missed flavor and texture of coconut. If you don't go overboard with the coconut, some people may just gobble it down, thinking it's just choco-chip. Delightful recipe =) thanks for sharing!

LOVE these cookies! This is my second time using this recipe and this time I added 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract (for half a recipe). This gave them a little more coconut flavor and made them even more divine. I also used 1/2 semisweet and half white chocolate chips. YUM! Thanks! :)

My god...I don't think I should make these again as I can't stop eating them, I normally don't eat a lot of sweet things but I bake for my husband and just try a small amount, but these are so good, if I start to put on any weight I know who to blame

HIGH ALTITUDE ALTERATION :) I'm in Cheyenne @ 6700 Ft. Alt. so I Only use 1/2 C. White Sugar and 1/2 C. Brown Sugar and increase flour to 2 & 3/4 C. to 3 C.  I also used sweetened coconut due to the decrease in sugar.  These were Perfect and my sister that hates coconut was even eating them!    These don't spread either.  They are more like a macaroon drop. Enjoy!

I was a little cautious useing chocolate chips in a coconut cookie... at first, they blended rather nice and stayed fresh for a while.

The coconut wasn't overpowering in this cookie which is probably why my family ate them.  I love coconut, but they don't.

these cookies are fabulous.  as another reviewer said, if you think of them as just the perfect chocolate chip cookie, you won't be disappointed.  i find the coconut adds more texture than anything--the flavor is subtle, but it imparts a rich chewiness to the cookie that is just...MMMMM.  NOM NOM NOM.  i have found that the secret to taking this recipe from just delicious to 'drop dead' is the use of good quality vanilla (i use vanilla bean paste) and good chocolate.  i took some of these to my neighbors and they raved about them, as did my husband's co-workers.  this will be my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe for life, and that's sayin' something ;)

A soft and yummy cookie.  Not a very strong coconut flavor in my opinion but my family and friends thought they were perfect.  One made the comment that it was like eating a Mounds candy bar.  Will make again and might toast the coconut before hand to see if it enhances the coconut flavor.

The dough was thick that I could not drop it to the cookie sheet, but had to roll it into balls.
The taste was great however the cookies got as hard as rock a few minutes after I took them out of the oven.

I used this recipe as a guide/base for my own creation.  Basically instead of one of the cups of flour I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup rolled oats and a 1/4 cup ground flaxseed.  I also added another egg, and 1/2 tsp. coconut flavoring.  Omigod these came out amazing!  We ate the 1st batch before the 2nd batch was done baking.

I'm not crazy for this cookie.  I didnt get alot of coconut flavor out of it, the coconut was more stringy made the texture not as pleasing as i'd like.

Absolutely love these cookies. If you think of them as the best chocolate chip cookies you will ever eat you will love this recipe. They are not "coconutey tasting," the coconut just makes the cookies moist and delicious.

FABULOUS!!! Loved the coconut and choco chips together.  Made so many cookies and family loved them.  I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter and only 1/2 of coconut due to hubby not "really" liking it much (he ate the most)...These turned out so great I am making them for kids test dates for State tests this month.  Thanks....

Mmmmm.. added 2 tablespoons butter to the recipe, and used milk choc chips (didn't have full 2 cups, so only used about 1 1/2 cups). Still, these were delicious! Not overwhelmingly coconut flavored, so if you're in for that, I'd suggest adding another 1/2 to 1 cup. The batter spread out as it baked to make very chewy, delicious cookies. You may want to chill before baking if you'd like your cookies to maintain their shape. The coconut adds a sweet & unique taste & texture. The coconut flavor really comes out after they've cooled.

These were good. Like many others, I wanted a recipe to use up the last little bit of coconut that I had, but in doing so I didn't have quite two cups. I used 1 3/4 cups and I think that the recipe sufferred from it a little. If I do make them again I will definitely stick to the recipe!! So, don't skimp on the coconut!!

I've made these cookies twice now and they come out perfect every time. The first time they were a bit thinner and the batch I made today came out thick and chewy, chewy with a nice thin crisp outer layer. I'm not sure why the difference, but I paid close attention to the directions this time and followed them to the letter.  As for the ingredients, I added an extra handful of chocolate chips and about two extra handfuls of coconut (I have small hands mind you).  They are definitely best enjoyed after cooling for a couple of minutes and being followed by a cold drink!  Also, I used a rounded scoop (1Tbsp) and got 40 cookies)

This is a perfect go to cookie recipe when you want something simple but has more to offer than good ol'fashioned chocolate chip cookies.

Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!!

These are so good, I'm glad I made them.  I gave away half of the batch to my sister and I've been getting an ear full for giving them away from my husband and mother who wanted them for herself.  These cookies stay soft but have the delightful taste of toasted coconut on the outside.  They have a really nice chewy texture, and the chocolate is highlighted so well in the cookie.  I used Milk Chocolate, but I think my next batch will be Semi-Sweet just to mix-it-up a little.  Also, on the bad side this is the best tasting dough ever, if you have a weakness for taking a taste consider preparing these with a pasteruized egg product.  I'm considering making these my signature cookie when I'm asked to bring a treat to an event.

Best cookies ever! I make them for everyone I know and I have yet to find someone who doesn't love them! Even people who say they hate coconut love them! Chewy and fluffy and chocolaty and just perfect! A  great mix between a chocolate chip cookie and a macaroon. Thanks!

SO good! :) Made these last night for the first time, and split the cookie mix in half. Mixed one half with 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, and baked. Mixed the other half with the new (or new to me at least) MINT semi sweet chocolate chips, and baked. 

Both were excellent!!! 

Brought them in to work today and everyone loved them.

Oh WoW! These were a huge hit. I halved the recipe, and that was a mistake because the cookies were gone in a day. They stay nice and chewy. Exactly how you want a cookie.

These were great! A nice twist to a classic cookie.. I do recommend cooking them until the top is golden brown - we like our cookies chewy so we pulled out the batch when they were pretty white on top (like we normally do) but they were a lot better when cooked a but longer. The inside was still chewy and yummy, and the outside had a nice thin crunch - yum! I also did half the batch with a handful of walnuts, even better! Thanks for the recipe!

PERFECT! Just the right balance of chocolatey goodness and sweet coconut. The biggest advantage of the added coconut is the great texture it gives these cookies. And they look as great as they taste!

Definitely a keeper- You can't have just one!

Ooooooh these are SO good! I've been hunting around for a good chocolate chip cookie recipe that is worth the calories, and this one is it. The coconut adds a lovely, crispy, tender texture. This is going to be my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe from now on. I halved the recipe and it was perfect. I subbed a few tbsps worth of flour with wheat germ because I like the texture of wheat germ in cookies, and it worked fab. Next time I might add a tbsp of flaxseeds, too.

Excellent cookie.  I added a cup of chopped pecans and thought it was a nice touch.  Now that I've tried them, I think that the butterscotch chips mentioned by other posters would be a nice addition as well.

Really good cookies.  I used Smart Balance and they came out perfect (I underdo them slightly).  Moist, chewy cookies.  I would not say they were really unique, just good chocolate chip cookies with a interesting and delicious touch  of coconut.

These are awesome - butterscotch chips definitely are a good twist on a great recipe.  I tend to make my cookies a little larger, so I had to bake them for 12 minutes.

These were good, but I wasn't wowed.  They are much better if you let them cool completely before eating.  I used half butterscotch chips based on many of the prior reviews.  They do stay soft if stored for a few days.

These cookies were great. Similar to traditional chocolate chip cookies, but with a fun flare that makes them irresistible. I've already made 3 batches!

These cookies were delicious.  I cut the chocolate chips in half and added butterscotch chips.  This gave the cookies a nice little twist.

I added about a tsp. of coconut extract to the dough and these cookies turned out wonderfully.  We loved them.  My husband loves coconut and he devoured them.  Will definitely make again.

Good cookies. They grow on you. they weren't as i expected, would like a bit more of a chocolaty taste to it, so might add some cocoa powder to a next batch. But after you have a couple, they just get better. I did put the temperature a bit lower on my oven, cause they get a burned taste pretty quickly, before they actually are burned.

I just finished baking these delicious cookies, having halved the exact recipe as there are only two of us here to devour them all.  I'm not much of a baker at all, but thought I would give this recipe a go, having read all the great reviews.  They turned out fantastic and I wouldn't change a thing to the original recipe.  Thanks for this one!

just finished this making these cookies and they are wonderful! Light and crispy. Will keep for future cooking days with my 2 year old daughter. She loves them too. I cut the recipe in half and added 1 tablespoon of vanilla instead of 1 tsp. Also add a few extra chocolate chips. Which my daughter is now wearing all over her face..LOL
Sinfully delicious! Cooked for 11 min at 350C instead of the 8-10 min.

This was easy and really good. Chocolate and Coconut are a great combination. They are still chewy a few days later. The recipe makes a lot though, so next time I will cut it in half. Addictive, milk chocolate chips would be good too.

I made these cookies over three years ago and I thought I'd try them again.  They are soft and chewy with crispy edges!  Yum!  Definitely worth making more often.  It's a nice change of pace from regular chocolate chip cookies.

These cookies ROCK!  I used huge semi-sweet chocolate chips that made them even more chocolatey.  The recipe makes a lot of cookies but I still added another half batch since they were so good!  I received a ton of compliments on them.

My family is RAVING about these cookies.  Hubby has asked for more, so I'm baking another batch as I type.  An absolutely wonderful cookie!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, but baked only 7 minutes as my oven runs alittle hot.  They come out beautifully and alittle "thicker" than the normal chocolate chip cookie.  Someone mentioned this cookie had nice presentation, and I agree completely.  Excellent recipe - thanks Reena!

I had a craving for coconut so looked for something sinful...this hit the spot! Great taste and texture, just the right amount of coconut, so it's not overpowering. I actually baked only half batch, because I wanted to test it first, now I regret I don't have more! I made slight changes, using half the butter and the other half of oil, and a little less chocolate chips. Everything else was the same but they came out fewer than expected. Will do again!

Here is what I did:  
First of all.........they are AMAZING COOKIES with a nice taste and I WILL be making them again but......I am one person so the recipe got cut in half and I followed it to a "T" .... almost.  I cut back on the sugar and used 1/4 C. brown and 1/4 C. white sugar and beat the snot of the butter, egg, vanilla and sugars......after it was fluffy I added the rest and only mixed until everything was incorporated.  I used my large cookie scoop and baked them for 15 minutes.......edges were brown and my cookies did not "spread" out much at all.  When I put the ball of dough on my cookie sheet I mushed them down a bit and got a nice, uniform (not thin) cookie.   Thank you for sharing this ..... coconut lovers unite!

I did make three changes.
 1) butter flavor crisco instead of butter (Fluffier texture)
2) almond extract instead of vanilla 
3) 1/2 t additional salt to offset sweetness of coconut.
Mmm...Think almond joy:-)

These were good. I was a bit short of chocolate chips so added about 1/4 cup of craisins to make the full 2 cups .  I followed the recipe as shown.  Made them a bit small and they were ready in 8 minutes cooking time.

My husband asked me to bake these for a twist on Chocolate Chip cookies. Looking for an added flavor to the Chips. I made them last night. Followed directions exactly. Disappointed in their flavor. Not really any different then a regular CC cookie. While you could feel the coconut in your mouth while chewing, you didn't taste any coconut flavor.  Cookie was moist,  but not what we wanted.  One and done recipe for us.

These were AMAZING! But two tips!!! I only used 1.5 cups of chocolate chips and it was more than enough. Also, I needed to bake them for about 11 minutes to get them golden-brown. Otherwise they were still too doughy in the middle.

I love these cookies especially with a glass of milk I used 1/2 of white sugar  or any substitute, 1/2 a cup of Brown sugar. Half semi sweet and half dark choco chips. Then I added 2 tablespoons of milk and they came out great and chewy.

The cookies came out good but not great. Next time I will reduce salt to half teaspoon and I will cook much, much longer. The best tasting parts of the cookies are the  crispy edges.

I used one less cup of flour substituting with 1 cup of oats. Also added 1/2 - 2/3 cup of dried cranberries and half milk chocolate and half semi sweet chocolate chips. Got very good reviews from family who liked it.

Hands down, these are the best cookies ever.  I halved the recipe since 72 seemed like too many.  I won't be doing that again.  Everyone at work came back for more.  The only thing I changed was adding about 5 more minutes to the baking time as we enjoy a more crunchy cookie.

These are my favorite dessert ever. Just when you thought a chocolate chip cookie couldn’t get any better! Only tip: make sure you use unsweetened coconut flakes. I used sweetened one time and I wasn’t a fan.

I only had half the chocolate suggested so I added 1/2 tsp cardamom powder and 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder and they came out great. I cooked exactly 8 min and thought they looked under cooked but I wanted to make sure they stayed soft. They were perfect after cooling completely if u love a chewy cookie. I will definitely be making them again and didn't even miss the other cup of chocolate chips I left out. Thx

Also inspired by an abundance of leftover shredded coconut, I made these tonight and they were great. The recipe is totally basic and versatile--I subbed coconut oil for butter, and instead of two cups of chocolate chips (because I was short on those), I did one cup of chips and one cup of nuts. Easy and yummy and a little different!

I followed the recipe exactly and my family said they were the best cookies ever.  I did beat the ingredients quite a while before adding the flour.  They came out soft in the middle and crispy on the outside - and stayed that way for two weeks.  They froze really well too. I liked how they coconut taste was subtle.  I took them to a meeting and everyone raved about them.

I use this as base cookie recipe and add whatever I am feeling like for the day. I have added all kinds of nuts, white chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, coconut, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, raisins, and cranberries. They all turn out great. I have even added all the ingredients at the same time, just keeping to the overall volume of 4 cups to the add-ins.

I should add that I used butter flavored crisco instead of butter, which got around the 'flat' issue that some mentioned in the recipe.  Instead of using chocolate chips I added chopped pecans instead --- WoNDERFUL!!  One of the best coconut pecan cookies I've had.  Will definitely make these again :)

This recipe is delicious as is, but I added some cocoa powder to distinguish them from regular chocolate chip cookies for those who are quick to grab without looking.

I'd give 4.5 stars, simply because it's a little too sweet. Next time I may reduce the sugar a bit. These come out with a nice crunch on the edge and a chewy middle. Followed recipe exactly.

The first time I made these was to use up a bag of coconut I had in the freezer. Needless to say, I fell in love with them and have made them 6+ times since. Everyone in my house loves them and they never last more than 3-4 days. This is definitely my favorite cookie recipe.

We love these cookies!!! If they are too flat, they need more flour.  If you aren't sure about the amount of flour. I used the amount in the recipe and made one cookie.  It went flat so I added more flour...then I baked one more cookie.  It still wasn't enough...I added a bunch more and made one cookie and it was perfect. I made these again to determine how much flour and the total amount of flour ended up being 3 1/2 cups...substantially more than the recipe.  thank you for posting this!!!!

Very good but I only put 1 cup of chocolate chips in because I'm not crazy about too much chocolate.  I prefer the taste of the cookie and coconut.

Very yummy cookies.  I followed the recipe to the letter except I cut down to 18 servings (recipe made just for the hubby and I)  and that is 36 cookies, which came out at exactly the 36 count!  I used my small-sized cookie scoop (just over 1" wide), and that just makes it so much easier, faster and less messy to put them out onto the cookie sheet, which I covered with parchment paper for easier clean-up later!  My hubby said the flavor of these cookies was "delicious" and "totally awesome".  So, this recipe is a keeper!

These cookies are delicious, and I thought the perfect texture! Though I do think (never thought I'd say this) that 2 cups is too many chocolate chips - it completely overpowers the coconut (I used unsweetened coconut chips from Trader Joes). Next time I'll let coconut have the stage.

1tablespoon of coconut extract 
1cup of chopped pecans

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing. I toasted the coconut before adding it to the recipe. I followed the recipe, except I cut sugar to 2/3 cup and brown sugar to 1/3 cup. I wanted to add coconut extract instead of vanilla, but I didn't have any on hand. This is a good recipe and I will make it again. I bet it would taste good with some chopped pecans added too.

A true go to that I know everyone will love. I've made the exact version countless times. There are also times I exchange or add in the fun ingredients. Around the holidays I love craisins or nuts or both in them. Tonight I'm adding peanut butter to half the batch and am eager to see how yummy they will be. 
I make sure to always use parchment paper. I have learned that my cookie scoop sizes varies so I just have to keep an eye on them in the oven. I pull them out when the outer bottom begins to brown. Then I leave them on the cookie sheet for about five minutes before transferring the parchment paper with the cookies on top onto a wire rack. They need to set up. 
Best cookie recipe for anyone who enjoys coconut and chocolate!

Followed the recipe exactly, ended up with 6dz cookies.  Next time I make these, I'll definitely add more coconut. I couldn't really tell there was any coconut - either from texture or taste. 
They did not bake up too flat, they did not taste greasy, and there were quite enough chocolate chips in them - in short other than my wanting to add more coconut next time, these cookies are good as written.

These are pretty good cookies.  I adjusted the sugar just to the half cup of brown, it would have been overly sweet otherwise.  The coconut and chocolate chips give the added sweetness.   A little bit chewier would have made them better.    They actually get better the day after they're made.

I get so many compliments on these cookies. I followed the recipe exactly and baked them in my convection oven for 10 minutes and they are perfect!

OMFG these cookies are sooooo good. I halved the recipe, which was very easy to do, and it made exactly 36 cookies. They smell AMAZING. It doesn't specify, but make sure your butter is really soft--it works better.

I changed this a bit, I make this with Organic Gluten free flour and Organic agave as my older son is allergic to Wheat and we don't us processed sugar. And I use organic bittersweet chocolate chips sweetened with organic evaporated cane juice and organic unsweetened coconut flakes. NO ONE BELIEVES me when I say I did not use wheat or add sugar only agave. They are scrumptious and always a big hit at any function or just at home when I have the time to bake and need an almost healthy treat. Thanks for the recipe!

These are really good! The chocolate goes well with the coconut. I used all brown sugar and did only 1 cup of chocolate chips and 11/2 of coconut.

I am not a baker at all but I had enough stuff in the pantry to make these since the kids were asking for cookies. I also added half a cup of slivered almonds since I had those in the pantry needing to be used.And the chocolate chips I used had caramel centers. Needless to say, kid approved and will make them again.

Converted to cookie bars! Used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 Crisco shortening and then added an extra Tablespoon of flour. Otherwise, stuck to the recipe exactly and put it in a 9x13 glass dish. Baked for ~20 mins. It's amaaaazing! Thank you for this recipe!

For a subtle coconut flavor without the chewiness of the coconut, I omitted the coconut altogether, halved the butter, and added 1/3 c virgin coconut oil instead.  I added 1/2 c chopped pecans and cut salt down to 1/2 t.  Very nice cookie.

These cookies are awesome!  A true crowd pleaser.  If you half the recipe, it makes about 2 dozen.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.  My only tip is to warm up the eggs before baking, it does make a difference.

This is a cookie that I am most certain to make again with further tweaks to the recipe.  I added 2 Tbsp of milk this time and the texture and thickness were spot on.  I just wished that they had more of a coconut flavor.  I am considering trying coconut extract, and a different kind of coconut next time in hopes of making this recipe perfect in my eyes.  Well done Reena B!

I made these for my friend's birthday present, because he loves chocolate and coconut! First, I made 1/2 the recipe. Substituted as follows: added 1 Tbs of Fat Free Milk, used Almond vs Vanilla flavoring, Chocolate Chunk Semi Sweet Chips and Sweetened Coconut. I used 1/2 the amount of sugars recipe called for so it wasn't too sweet. The first pan I made balls and baked for 10 mins, which came out fluffy. The second pan, I flattened the balls and baked for 12 mins, which came out more crispy. Flavor was amazing- kinda like an Almond Joy-Mounds Bar combo. I think my friend will love them, if not, he can re-gift them to me:)

They were good but I hard a hard time making them consistent.  They seemed to brown up really fast.  I followed the recipe except I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp coconut extract (since I had it on hand and thought it would kick up the flavor) It did!  I would consider going with more coconut extract if I made them again.

Yummy cookies!  I took some other's suggestions and used 1/2 cup butter & 1/4 shortening.  I also only used 3/4 cup of white sugar.  I used 1 cup butterscotch chips and 1 cup chocolate chips.  The coconut I used was unsweetened and finely shredded - so I only used what I had -which was about 1 1/2 cups. Most of the cookies stayed pretty thick - only a few flattened out.  I will be using this recipe again!

Great Cookie!  Would have been a 5 star, but i had to recede the butter to 3/4 cup and add another 1/2 cup flour to keep from spreading too much and being greasy.  Much richer and interesting than regular chocolate chip.

I am in love with coconut. These were so great! I added another 1/4 cup of flour and 2 tbsp of milk. They were fluffy and delicious. :)

I added 2 black (old) bananas and more flour until it was thick like cookies.  I also skipped the brown sugar. Came out great.

i wanted to get rid of a bunch of chocolate macaroons that i had left over, so i used those (crumbled) instead of the chocolate chips and the coconut flakes. i also didnt have any eggs so i used a pudding cup for moisture and binding purposes. these came put really moist, rich, and soft. really tasty!

YUM! I made these last night and I couldn't stop eating the batter...and the cookies were even better!!!  I made the recipe exact except substituting about 1/3 of the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  I love the coconut.  A great cookie!  Thank you!

I am not a huge fan of coconut, so I will use a little less in the future.  They also weren't as moist as I hoped it would be.  My friend LOVED these cookies though.  =D

This recipe rocks.  I prefer dark choc chips and cut back to 1 1/2 so has not to overpower.  I've also used virgin coconut oil or organic coconut oil for 1/2 the butter.  YUM!

These are really good.  I tried to make with applesauce and not butter and they turned out ok, but obviously much better with just butter. :)

Very good and very easy to make. I didn't have quite enough chocolate chips, so I also added butterscotch chips to make a total of 2 cups.  Yum-o!  The directions didn't say whether to spray the pan with butter/spray, so I sprayed it lightly with Pam spray, but I don't think it needed it.  The cookies didn't spread much at all, and my batch made about 80 cookies.  I love the coconut flavor - very different tasting.  Thanks for the great recipe.

the best coconut/chocolate cookies I've had. For a healthier version I subsituted applesauce for butter, which made them more moist and chewy.

Absolutely delicious cookie!  I was bored in the kitchen and wanted to whip up a batch of cookies and I had everything on hand for these; however, I did add 2 tbsp. milk and also added 1 tsp. of coconut extract as well to the recipe.  It is cookie perfection!  YUM!
Thanks!

Really good cookie. Definately more chocolate than cocconut flavor but it was a nice change to the standard chocolate chip cookie. 
So if you like chocolate chip cookies but want to try something a little different but not too dramatic, this is a good cookie for you.

Note: This is a review of the above recipe and how it turned out. Not my interpretation of it;) I made them just as the recipe said to, used unsweetened coconut since it didn't specify and loved the results. Nice chewy texture similar to an oatmeal cookie but with all the yuminess of coconut! I would highly recommend them and plan on making them again.

These are really yummy cookies. I agree with the other reviewers, they are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Similar to chocolate-chip cookies, but the coconut adds a little something extra. That and I added 3/4 cup of oatmeal, which I think was a nice touch. Maybe adding a spice would be good too. I'll make these again!

Oh man, Oh man!!
These are really good and unfortunately couldn't make them like I was suposed to due to lack of ingredients. I can just imagine how yummy these are done correctly.
This is what I did. 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 shortening. 1 cup coconut and 1 cup chocolate chips. The remaining ingredients stayed the same.

These were good, and VERY easy to make. My husband loved them and he does not like coconut at all. My BF who is a great cook and is a huge critic LOVED them, she didn't believe me that they were homemade.

By far the easiest cookie to make with the best reviews from family and friends.  The only change I make is to add a bit of coconut extract to give them a strong coconut flavor.  Even people who claim a hatred for coconut like these!

These were a fun change to normal chocolate chip cookies... next time I will try toasting the coconut before to bring out more flavor.  I took my cookies out when the edges were brown and the centers were still soft.

These cookies are a great variation on the traditional chocolate chip cookie. I switched the chocolate chips to milk chocolate b/c of personal preference and added about 1-1/4 c. quick cooking oats to bulk up the dough. Baked them at 350 for about 8 minutes and they came out crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. The cookies aren't even completely finished and my husband has already eaten several!

My husband really enjoyed them.  They were a little fluffy, I might have added a little too much baking soda-but they were good!  I am taking them to church tomorrow for a pot luck!

These are okay.  I added some cinnamon, ground cloves and nutmeg.  I think that added a lot to the flavor.  They are kind of flat so next time I'll add more flour next time.

These were good, but after all the great reviews, I guess I expected much more.  I would prefer a regular choc chip cookie any day.  I took them to a potluck and ended up bringing about half of them back with me.  Good, but not great.  I doubt I will ever make these again.

A chocolate chip cookie, only BETTER!  The coconut adds something new to an already favorite cookie.  Followed the recipe exactly.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly, but for 2 TB of milk. They were just ok. Tasted a lot like a regular choc chip cookie. I didn't care for them, but boyfriend and kids ate them up. Made them again today and cut the choc chips down to 1 cup and grated a square of semisweet chocolate into the dough. Also I toasted the coconut in the preheated oven before folding into the dough. The coookies taste so much better with the toasted coconut!

These cookies are good but not something that I will probably make again, family is just not eating them like they do with the other cookies that I make.  Thanks for posting, anyway.

I substituted 1 c choc chips for butterscotch chips, and it was incredible! I also added 1/2 tsp almond, as I always do with my cookies. These disappeared in minutes! Even my mother was begging for the recipe!

This cookie is really good. My husband (who doesn't like coconut) likes this cookie.  One tip: When measuring the coconut, measure as you would brown sugar, firmly packed.  Then you won't have to worry about adding more coconut, unless you want to.  I was asked to make these cookies for an associates family reunion, and this family is a family of cooks.  Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies seemed so promising but I'm really disappointed.  There is no coconut flavor even though I added extra coconut and coconut extract.  On the upside the texture is there and it keeps the cookies very soft and moist.  The problem is in the chocolate chips, they overpower any other flavor. This cookie would probably be great with white chocolate chips, it's just too late to save this batch.

These were very good, but, as another poster mentioned, I guess I found them a bit ordinary.  I was expecting more based on all the rave reviews. They are very good chocolate chip cookies that happen to have some coconut in them.

These were delicious. I felt that the chocolate was overwhelming the coconut too much though, next time I will do as suggested and put in less chocolate and more coconut.
I also agree that they were pretty greasy!

These cookies were very average. They weren't disgusting, but there wasn't enough flavour. I didn't taste the coconut, and the best part was the chocolate chips. The texture was fluffy and chewy. The cookies burnt when baked for 8 minutes. 

I won't be making these again.

Wonderful!  I have no idea how many cookies I got because they disappeared so fast. I had a bit of trouble getting the cookies off of the cookie sheet after they had sat for 5 minutes. But I had baked them about 2 minute longer than stated. They were extra crunchy like we like them. Maybe I will try and grease the cookie sheet next time. This one is a keeper. Thanks Reena!

Excellent cookies, great flavor and texture with the coconut.   It gave me more like 4.5 dozen cookies than 6, but maybe I just like them bigger than usual!

I just made these cookies, and they are just fab! I had to make a little substitution though... I had no Baking Soda, so I just used Baking Powder in it's place. Next time I'll try it with the Soda... but it was still superb!
