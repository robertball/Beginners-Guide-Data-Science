I did a bit of substituting; OJ for the pineapple juice and dried pineapple, mango and papaya for the apricots - I think you could probably substitute any juice and any dried fruit.  I also changed the flours a bit, adding more white and less whole wheat, since I know my family prefers that.  It turned out very well, except that I will add a 1/2 tsp. of salt next time I make it.  A bit of butter makes up for the lack of salt, and it freezes well. The coriander sounded a bit odd to me at first, but it goes well with the ginger and cinnamon.

This is a delightful bread.   It's not very sweet as you might expect of a fruit bread, but has a nice balanced, enjoyable flavor.    We make it over and over.

I just baked my first fruit loaf using this recipe. However, I used fresh squeezed orange juice instead of pineapple juice and reversed the quantities of white flour and wholewheat. I really liked the result, though it tastes a bit 'eggy'. Also, I didnt have any baking soda, so I added another 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder (I am a novice. I dont know if that's ok, but I did it, anyways!)

Fantastic bread, not too terribly sweet and makes a nice breakfast bread/snack bread. I think I may add more apricots next time or puree them by personal preference but nonetheless, this recipe was very satisfying. :)

I don't find this loaf sweet enough and I'm not one to favour really sweet food.  When I make this next time, I'll use 1/2 c Br Sugar.  makes a nice looking loaf, which took a bit longer to cook  - just about an hour.  I think I will increase all the spices as well so that it lives up to its name.
