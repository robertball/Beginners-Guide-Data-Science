As a cake decorator, I've tried a lot of different "doctored cake mix" recipes.  This is one of the best I've tried.  I love how it only takes 1 cup of sour cream (others take 2 cups).  Don't be afraid to add the full amount of oil---it's cake!  I prefer using mini chocolate chips, and they add a lot to the recipe.  The little ones don't "sink" to the bottom of the cake pan AND are small enough to melt completely, leaving a small bit of pure chocolate in each bite.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

Cut the calories and this cake still tastes awesome.  I used Sugar free pudding mix, fat free sour cream, unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and egg whites... you'd never know it was ~200 less calories/slice.  It was very moist and chocolaty which is hard to find when you use the "healthier" options.

Very, very moist, rich cake.  Followed recipe exactly.  This is going to become a standard at our house.  Perfect with a dusting of powdered sugar and a cold glass of milk.  I can definitely see where this one won the award!  Update 8/20/06 - have made this recipe many, many times now for parties and get-togethers.  It ALWAYS receives rave reviews.  I have experimented with different flavors of cake mixes/pudding/chips and had wonderful results.  Fudge cake/choc pudding/choc mint chips.  Carmel cake/butterscotch pudding/butterscotch chips.  Cherry cake mix/vanilla pudding/cherry chips.  Fudge cake/choc pudding/peanut butter chips (this one was awesome!).  This is my standard cake now I make for everything.  Thanks so much for sharing this with us.

Delicious! I made this for my mom's birthday and it was a big hit! Slight changes: I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix, with 1/2 cup veg. oil and 1/3 cup milk (to help with the batter consistency), and 1 cup of chocolate chips. I baked it in a bundt cake pan at 335 degrees for 55-60 min. It turned out perfectly! Very rich and moist, but not at all wet or 'crispy' on the outside edges. Let it cool for an hour in the pan, then removed and drizzled the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site over it, garnished with strawberries and powdered sugar. Great presentation and great rich, chocolate taste. I would bake this again! I'll have a picture up soon.
Update (10/24): Was wondering if anyone had used this recipe for cupcakes? Wasn't sure how the recipe would hold up when baked in a smaller size. Thanks!

I was hesitant because I always cook from scratch. But I've had so much trouble lately with  getting my chocolate cakes moist because of the high altitude I'm at, so I'll try anything. It turned out perfect. I cooked it in 9" cake pans for a birthday cake filled it with raspberry & frosted with chocolate buttercream. Everyone raved about it, and it was so moist. I used the mini chocolate chips and they were perfect, melted totally. My husband said it was almost like a brownie cake. Great for decorating because it holds it shape and doesn't crumble. It will be my standard chocolate cake recipe, can't wait to try it again with different fillings and frostings. Yum!!!

I had to make a second cake.  The recipe has too much oil and would not cook completely without the outside being overdone.  Cooked it again with 1/2 the oil and it was great.

I made this for family for Valentine's Day. I did use 3/4 C. oil as suggested. I replaced the h2o with strong coffee and used a bag (11.5 oz.) of Ghirardelli's 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips. I used 1 round and 1 8x8 pan so that I could cut the round cake in half and push it against 2 of the squares sides to form a heart. These baked perfectly at 330 for 45 minutes. I topped it with whipped cream and strawberries I dipped in chocolate. This made a good sized heart cake that was devoured in 2 nights. It was so rich and chocolate-y that we could not keep our hands off of it. Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

Thanks for posting this recipe, Denise.  It's a keeper for me.  I can say that for me, it is just almost too much chocolate cake.  I love that this cake is guaranteed to rise and have a fine texture due to the cake and pudding mixes yet it is lifted from being 'just a cake mix' by the addition of sour cream and the chocolate chips.

I found this cake very easy to make and it was a blessing in disguise that the top of the cake rose above the rim of my tin.  When the cake cooled, I was able to cut a perfectly flat base for the cake.. and thus sample the cake warm.  It was bliss when eaten with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.

I followed reccommendations of other reviewers by cutting the oil to 1/2 cup, adding 1/3 cup milk and cutting back the chocolate chips to about 1 1/4 cups, or a large bag of chocolate chips in Australian brands.

I agree that this cake is enough without a glaze, but as I'm making this for a birthday (mine!!) - I will be topping it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website.

This is a great recipe to have when you need a special cake quickly and with the minimum of fuss.

Two thumbs up!  I am sure the chocoholics in my family will polish this up tonight.

This chocolate cake is phenomenal! I have been making this for about 2 years now for many, many different occasions, and it always gets rave reviews. I usually make the cake in regular cake pans, slice the cakes in half lengthwise, and spread seedless raspberry preserves on each cut half. Then I place the layers back together and frost the cake sides, top, and between each cake with "Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting" (also on this site). Chocolate doesn't get any better than this! Thanks, Denise for such a wonderful chocolate cake recipe!

i don't like cake and I don't like to bake, but I had to make a dessert for a potluck dinner. I chose this recipe because of the ratings it had. I followed the advice of another and used mini chocolate chips.....don't really know if it made a difference taste-wise. I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer than written. Took the leftovers to work and it disappeared! And, as someone who doesn't like cake, I thought it was fantastic (everyone else thought so too!). I also want to comment on the people who rate lower on this recipe based on their own changes. I strongly feel you have no right to rate the recipe if you've made your own changes or additions to the recipe. Make the recipe as written, then rate away....it's not fair to the person who submitted the recipe to have it slammed for changes you made.

If you don't like rich gooey chocolate, don't make this cake.  I am a chocoholic and have made this several times.  It has turned out delicious every time, but always turn down the oven half way through, otherwise it can get a little crispy on the outside. Great with cream cheese icing or alone with icing sugar sprinkled on it.

This is now the ninth time I have made this cake.So many people have requested this recipe from me,but I do not understand why they feel the need to put a different spin on the amount of ingredients,such as the amount of oil etc.Every time they put less oil in there recipe I am told from others, behind there back, that it was not as good as the way I make it because it is not near as moist.Every one that I know of that has had this cake has raved about it,so why toy with the ingredients.Just make your cake exactly as this recipe is stated and you will be rewarded.I put a thermometer in my oven and at exactly 350F it takes fifty minutes exactly to bake.If I leave it in for fifty five minutes it just starts to give a hint of being slightly burnt.Some things really are okay just the way they are and this recipe is one of them.I am not going to give this recipe to anyone from now on because most of them should just be enjoying eating it and not trying to bake it.They can search for there own recipe as they drew-ell over this one.Keep it real.

With 600+ 5-star reviews, I wanted to see if this recipe lived up to the hype. To help camouflage the boxed cake mix taste I added one teaspoon each of vanilla and chocolate extract, and used strong, brewed coffee for the water called for.  Having made many of these pudding enhanced recipes over the years, I knew a regular, 3.9 oz. package of pudding mix would work just fine.  In the end, it certainly is a good cake, one that I'd confidently serve anywhere to anyone, but it still is a common, easily identifiable pudding enhanced chocolate cake mix. Making a far superior scratch cake mix would not take much more effort or ingredients. I made this in a beautiful, specialty "Celebration" cake pan and topped it with Chocolate Glaze I, also from this site.  I garnished it with toasted, sliced almonds and a maraschino cherry in the center. It looked like a torte from a European bakery!

I DON'T REVIEW RECIPES, BUT I'M MAKING AN EXCEPTION FOR THIS ONE! YOU NEED TO READ THIS REVIEW!  I've been making this cake for a couple of years, and I promise it will make you look like a champ every single time. I always top it with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" which is also in allrecipes. I guarantee this combo will have your name on the lips of every chocolate lover in your neighborhood. I've used the mix for cupcakes. They are even more evil than the bundt cake, because even weight conscious moms that won't eat a whole piece of cake will have a cupcake! I've also substituted the devils food, chocolate pudding & chocolate chips with white cake mix, vanilla pudding and white chips. This makes the whole thing exactly the same in vanilla; the same texture, the same moist, gooey, chippy PERFECT cake. (the glaze won't work with white chips though) The staff at my 2 daughter's schools still talk about my cupcakes whenever they see me.  COPY THIS ONE TO YOUR RECIPE BOX FOLKS!!!

HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS:  Well despite wanting to say I made a cake from "scratch" as I hate any boxed items, I tried this & the soldiers loved it!  I only use 1/2C of olive oil (more would leave the outside crispy), 1/3C milk (helped w/consistency), 1C chocolate chips (more is too much & just a waste) & greased generously w/PAM to prevent any problems.  From a baking video, it's best to cut out a piece of wax/parchment paper in shape of what you're baking in & put on bottom, so you can easily take out & work w/layers. Also, I wanted to make sure some 1st timers didn't make the same mistake I did the 1st time I made this.  I forgot about the chocolate chips so when checking to see if this was done, I almost overcooked it b/c my toothpick kept coming up with what I thought was batter.  DOH!! Cooking at 335 for 55 minutes was perfect.  I used Satiny Chocolate Glaze like many others but had no idea it really wasn't a glaze but came on more like a frosting.  Next time I'll try a more traditional chocolate frosting as the kids kept wondering what all that fancy gooey stuff that did not taste "great" was instead of their normal chocolatey frosting. :)

Fabulous, rich cake! BUT cake mixes are no longer 18+ ounces. In order to keep the correct consistency, I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup, reduced the water to 1/3 cup and took away one egg. Turned out perfect!

This is, quite simply, the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  It has exceptional qualities.  First, it tastes silky and dense, yet it is light texture at the same time.  I was amazed.  Some of the reviews were negative (it tasted to some like an adultered box mix), but to me and my husband, it was sublime.  These were the changes I had to make due to my inability to accept the fact that it called for 1 cup of oil:

1) Replace half of the oil with half and half.
2) Replace half a cup of water with dark coffee(the cake will not taste like coffee, but will have a more deeper flavor).
3) I only used 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips and found that to be more than enough.

If you find that your batter is stiff after it has been mixed and will not pour, do not worry, that is how it is supposed to be.  Just spread it in the pans with a spatula.

I made this in two teflon coated 9 inch round pans and left it in the oven for 38 minutes.

I made this for the first time last night.  I used a dark chocoloate fudge cake mix, Jello instant chocolate mint pudding mix, and a bag of Andes mint chips.  Before I mixed the pudding mix into the batter I sifted out the mini mint green chips that come in the pudding mix.  Then after the cake was finished (I baked it for 55 minutes) and cooled, I frosted it with a can of melted chocolate frosting and then sprinkled the green chips on top.  It looked beautiful and right now, at 9:30 in the morning, there is less than half of it left at work.  The guys love it!

UPDATE:  I've made this cake two more times.  Once with a red velvet cake mix, white chocolate pudding mix, white chocolate chips, cream cheese frosting, and topped with chopped walnuts.  Last night I made it with a devil's food cake mix, chocolate pudding mix, and peanut butter chips.  I drizzled it with the frosting from the "Brownies with Peanut Butter Fudge Frosting" recipe on this site and topped it with mini Reese's Pieces.  This is such a versatile cake!

This cake was excellent. I couldn't bring myself to use a cup of oil so I cut back to 3/4 cup and it was still so moist. I used the full 2 cups of chocolate chips but used mini chips and they were wonderful. I drizzled ganache on the top and a tiny bit of white chocolate drizzle and put strawberries in the middle. I will post a picture. It looked professional. It is a very dense, moist cake. I made it for my son's birthday and he loved it. My father-in-law, who is a chocoholic like me, told me about 3 times how amazing it was. I sent some home with him and another guest. I can't stop eating it myself. It's dangerous to have in the house. I will make this again and again. The possibilities are endless with flavorings and toppings!

Just a hint: if you roll your chocolate chips in flour first, they will not sink to the bottom while baking. Wonderful recipe!

I made this as cupcakes and they were PERFECT.

I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 milk.  I also used fat free sour cream and mini chocolate chips (only 1/2 cup).  The cupcakes were DELICIOUS!!!!  Better than bakery cupcakes!  I iced them with buttercream frosting (powdered sugar, softened butter, milk, and vanilla extract) and they were perfect.

Thank you for the fantastic recipe!!!  These cupcakes went fast!!!

Well, with over 3000 great reviews, this recipe doesn't really need another one, but deserves it nonetheless. First time around, I used the larger chips and I kinda liked the fact that there was a bit of chocolate in every bite, but at the same time, at 350 and 55 minutes the cake overall was a bit too well done and a bit on the dry side. My first thought was that was how it was supposed to be... after all, it slipped out of the bundt pan picture perfectly! On the second try, I used the mini morsels and baked at 325 for 55 minutes. FRICKIN" PERFECT! Moist, chocolaty, almost brownie-like and I never got to the point of frosting , sprinkling or drizzling... it was gone in a heartbeat! Thanks so much for sharing this GREAT recipe Denise... can hardly wait to make it again and even try with other flavor cake mixes and chips!

I love this cake as does everyone that I serve it to. The recipe calls for an 18.25 oz. boxed cake mix. Unfortunately, most leading brands have now cut their weight amounts by almost 2 ounces. Thanks to the reviewer who said to use one box and 1/3 cup of a second box. It's kind of stinky of the manufacturers to do this. You are left to keep an opened box until the next cake. I have many "doctored" cake recipes that call for an 18.25 oz. box and I can now make the adjustment for all of them.

Fantastic!!!! I made this for my workmates and they devoured it all!! This is the best mud cake, very dense and very rich. Followed the recipe exactly. except i let the cake cool in the pan for an hour instead of 1/2 hour. This is such as easy recipe that required very little fuss to make. UPDATE: i used this recipe to make cupcakes and it worked great! i omitted the choc chips and reduced the baking time to 25 minutes. So lovely!

This is a great recipe. Just FYI here's a trick I
learned from Ina Garten. She says if you mix
a light dusting of flour on your chocolate chips,
before adding them to the batter it will prevent them from sinking to the bottom and help them suspend throughout the cake.

This is a great recipe but if your not used to gooey chocolate cake it might be a put-off. Here's some helpful tips that helped me.
Reduce the oil to 3/4 cup of oil. Make sure you purchase the right size box of chocolate pudding (you need the large box). Add 1 tablespoon vanilla extract (it really enhances the flavor). Use mini chocolate chips the incorporate better into the batter. Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees then lower the temperature to 300 degrees and bake an additional 45 minutes! This will eliminate the crispy outside many reviewers complain about. Inside will be gooey. Allow to rest in pan for at least an hour before inverting onto plate.

As written this cake is really high in fat and calories.  I made a few minor changes to healthify it and it was still OUTSTANDING!  I used non-fat sour cream rather than regular, and substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil (so 1/2 cup of each).  I also used a cup of Egg Beaters in place of the 4 whole eggs.  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips because that was all I had.    It was served to a group of very health conscious adults (who rarely eat dessert).  A few tried it and raved about it, so pretty much everyone ended up having a piece.  Several had seconds!    The cake was really, really moist and very chocolately.  I think if more chips had been used it would have made it too, too rich.    I drizzled on a basic glaze flavored with almond extract (1/4 cup melted butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp extract, and about four TBSP skim milk all whisked together).  It was perfect!  Note - vanilla extract could be used instead.

AMAZING CAKE! Not too sweet, even with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site. Use icing. Do not leave it out. Makes it Perfect! This is not too sweet as other users may say. Loved it sooo much. Not too moist or too dry. Just perfect! Don't be afraid to make this EXACTLY as it says. I did bring it down to 330 after 15 minutes because I was afraid the middle wouldn't cook enough. PERFECT. A tiny crisp arount the edges and amazingly delicious! I used a mix of 1 1/2 cups of mini and regular sized chips but could've used the whole 2 cups. And even though I was afraid to use a cup of oil, I did and it was not greasy AT all! You do hand mix it and it's like a brownie batter. Don't worry, it doesn't cook as thick as a brownie. Very nice.

I made these into cupcakes, and followed the recipe perfectly besides i cooked them for 20 mins & 30 degrees less, and they were great, even without any frosting or sugar on top.  I should also mention I am a horrible cook, but even I can make these, thanks for the great recipe!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a great doctored cake. Sorry to the author but I make it a lot better in several ways: 1) halve the oil to 1/2 cup, 2) add 1/2 cup Kahlua (instead of that other 1/2 C oil), 3) adding about a tsp or so of cinnamon, and 3) adding 2 tablespoons of finely shredded orange rind. This cake gets raves and demands for more wherever I take it.

What a fabulous chocolate cake recipe! My mother in law is a chocolaholic so I made this for her Birthday. I kept to the 2 cups of chocolate chips only I have a little mini food processor and I chopped them up so I had all different sizes of chips. It really helped to distribute the creamy chocolate of the chips evenly throughout the cake. It worked awesome! I used the satiny chocolate glaze and drizzled over the bundt cake, I then took butterscotch chips, melted in the microwave, put in a plastic ziplock, cut the corner (tiny hole) and drizzled the butterscotch back and forth over the glaze. It made for a beautiful presentation. I also took some Hershey's Heath Bar Crunch pieces and sprinkled them over the top. It is most definitely a favorite way to go. At the holidays I intend to do the satiny chocolate glaze with a little peppermint oil for a "mint chocolate" icing! I'll drizzle with melted white chocolate chips for that. Thanks for an awesome recipe! By the way, I also made this cake for my husbands work, I used a cream cheese icing which was good but according to my husband, the glaze with butterscotch is much better. I'm making again today and want to try using strong coffee instead of the water in the cake mix.

I'm editing to add that I've been making this recipe for a while now. It's my FAVORITE! I have been baking and decorating cakes and this is my most requested. HOWEVER... for reasons I can't explain it doesn't always come out consistent. Sometimes it is WAY to

I made this cake three times before rating it.  I made it the first time as written and it was very rich and decadent!  The second time I used 1½ cups of mini-chocolate chips, 3.3 oz size of chocolate pudding and ¾ cup oil.  It was delicious.  The third time I used white cake mix, 3.3 oz white chocolate pudding, ¾ cup oil and 1½ cups of white chocolate chips, it was divine!  You cannot go wrong with this cake.  All three times I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site, the last time using white chocolate chips.   That is really the only thing I would change . . . white chocolate does not need the addition of the butter in the glaze, just melt the chocolate with the corn syrup, and drizzle.  Truly a versatile cake to be proud of.

So easy I made a chocolate ganache frosting to drizzle over the top. I finally got to eat a piece this morning and wasnt that impressed.  It almost was too much chocolate.  and I never thought I would utter those words.

Yelow cake, vanilla pudding, lime zest, and blueberries with a simple lime glaze!

amazingly delicious and easy!  I top it off with a glaze of 1 cup each of chocolate chips and heavy whipping cream that's melted together on med/low heat (sitrred frequently.) Let cool and drizzle on cake.

I normally view cake as merely a means of consuming frosting.  While this cake is wonderful with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe on this site as others have mentioned, I can honestly say that it's amazing even frosting-less, as I learned the first time I made it when I left the cake to cool and ran to the store for an ingredient only to literally find half the cake gone when I came back.  My tips (I'm sure with this many reviews, someone else has mentioned these as well:) 1.  Many brands of cake mix already include pudding in the mix.  To avoid making the cake potentially soggy with all the pudding and sour cream, use a mix such as Duncan Hines which doesn't contain pudding (trust me, your cake will still be moist!) 2.  If you've never used a Bundt pan before, please note that you need to really grease it well and be sure to get the grease into all those little corners so that your cake comes out cleanly from the pan. 3.  For a really rich, dark chocolatey taste, replace the water in this recipe with freshly brewed coffee - it somehow takes the chocolate flavor to the next level.  Amazing cake and it truly doesn't taste like it's from a mix!

I was really excited to try this recipe, though it was disappointing. I could not detect how the sour cream and pudding added anything to the cake, and even the chocolate chips did little to help with the overall presentation. The texture was just what you would expect from any run of the mill boxed cake mix. I have no problem with boxed cake mixes, though when you sink extra money into extra ingredients, you want to be able to taste the difference. The texture was lacking, and the flavor was just a little bit better than what you would get from just using a one-dollar cake mix. I doubt I will be making this again.

This cake was a big hit! The person who compared it to a gourmet chocolate chip muffin was dead on. The texture is very similar, but the taste of this cake is much better! This was very rich, and very moist. I frosted it with a chocolate buttercream frosting and cooked it in 2 9 inch rounds. Be very careful to not overcook! It is the most common mistake when making chocolate cake!

After reading all the reviews, I was so excited about making this recipe.  I even followed it exactly as it was stated instead of making some of the changes (like the oil and choc chip amounts) that others had made.  It looked beautiful and smelled amazing but . . . . it didn't taste all that great.  It wasn't sweet enough and just tasted very plain - it just had a very chocolaty flavor that's all.  I tried to add a BUNCH of powdered sugar on top to sweeten it up but it didn't help.  Even had a few people at work eat it and they thought it was just ok - not great but ok.  Don't think I'll be making this one again.

Great recipe! Very rich. I did not use the chocolate chips, instead I baked this in two 9 inch round cake pans. Put holes in both layers with a skewer, poured melted caramels (melted with a little milk) on both layers and in between layers chopped up toffee Heath bars. I frosted mine with cool whip... not too sweet for such a rich cake. Very well received!

My son asked for a very chocolatey cake for his family birthday party and so I chose this one to try.  While I was making it exactly as the recipe is written, I thought it was going to be more like a brownie in texture.  It was so very rich looking.  I baked it in two 9" round pans, wrapped the cake in plastic wrap really well once cooled, followed by foil, then placed them in the freezer a week in advance of the party.  The day of the party, I unwrapped them completely after removing from the freezer to thaw.  While they were unfrozen, but still cold, I began to assemble the cake just as my 6 year old requested.  Chocolate mousse filling, chocolate ganache topping, mini peanut butter cups on top, and vanilla mousse accent piping.  The more I looked at the cake the more I began to shiver thinking this was going to be waaay too rich.  When it came time to serve it, I was bowled over.  This cake can handle rich flavors with it because it is the perfect blend of sweet vs. chocolate.  Ohhhh - and the moist texture was nothing like a brownie - the most tantalizing chocolate cake experience I've ever had in my life.  It was a big hit with my son.  Our guests were going gaga over it while I was still in shock that I produced something this amazing.  I'm picky about my recipes and what a rewarding experience to find such a treasure.  Thank you, Denise!!

I made this cake for my boss on her birthday. Everyone loved it! I made it into a double layer round cake and only cooked it for about 25 min and it turned out great. I also made it lower in fat by substituting fat free vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and applesauce for the oil, it was so moist and just the right amount of sweetness.

This came out awesome! I made cup cakes instead of a whole bundt cake, baking for 25 minutes. They came out beautiful and smelled up my entire house very nicely!

Finally baked this much raved cake( more than 1000 reviews!)today! I was abit anxious when i poured the batter into my bundt cake tin as the thick batter did not look like the usual cake batter...infact, looked more like cookie mixture! Baked it for 55 mins at 325C ( as my bundt tin is dark colored ). I left the cake in the tin for 1/2 hr, then made the satiny choc glaze ( recipe also from allrecipes ). I was glad tht the cake unmoulded easily and looked perfect. Taste and texture of cake was fantastic - moist n soft, without a hint tht it came out from a boxed cake mix. My husband and kids love it - hubby n son had 2nd helpings and my young daughter, who normally dislike cakes finished her cake in no time at all!!Thks Denise for sharing this wonderful easy recipe!

I wowed my coworkers with this one today!  Made exactly as written using the mini choc chips and this cake blew my expectations away:  it is very thick and dense, so I thought that it would not rise very much...it did.  I was worried that greasing the pan without the usual "flouring" step would cause the cake to stick...it didn't.  I thought that the dough (thick like brownies) would never cook in 50-55 minutes...it took 60 minutes in my oven but was VERY moist and delicious!  I topped it with the Satiny Choc Glaze from this site (very good and easy also) and filled the center with strawberries.  The cake traveled and cut very nicely.  A wonderful, easy and impressive cake!  Next time, I think I will use another reviewer's suggestion of subbing cooled cofee in place of the water.  A winner!  Thanks for sharing!

What a hit!  I've made this cake 3 times now for the biggest chocolate fans and they loved it. I don't have a bundt pan so I made a triple layer cake - just as good and makes a beautiful presentation.  I also added chocolate frosting - talk about fixing your choco-halic needs!

Easiest, moistest chocolate cake I've ever made!! I followed one reviewer and instead of one cup of oil, I used 1/3 milk and 1/2 oil. I made them into cupcakes and baked for 23 minutes in 350F oven. Gone in minutes!

I've been making this for way over 25 years, with exception of using 4 Tbl. rum in it, I use a DUNCAN HINES Yellow cake mix and I make a choc. glaze to drizzle over it.  My choc. chips never sink.  I get constant requests for this and they are so easy that I make 2 at a time.

I made this for a dinner party and it turned out excellent - moist and tasty.  I used the suggestion by others to use 1/2 oil and 1/3 cup milk -- and I baked at 350 for 1 hour but last 20 minutes I lowered the temperature to 325.  It turned out perfect and I did everything else as the recipe says.  For those using metric - the pudding mix is the 113 gram box.  I found the 5.9 ounce box confusing and I did convert it online but got different numbers for the grams.  Anyway, the recipes worked with the 113 gram pudding box.  Thanks for a delicious cake!

Excellent! This is an easy recipe that anyone could do! It’s very moist, has good flavor and texture. I tried out my new mini bunt cake pans, and got 6 of those and 11 “cupcakes” out of the recipe. The baking time on the mini bunt cakes were about 37min. For the cupcakes, they took about 30min to bake.

Yes, it is a wonderfully moist, dense, fudgy cake.  Just a couple things to note however.  First, don't be nervous if your batter looks like it's pulling together into a solid mass!  I had mine in the Kitchenaid on medium, for only 3 minutes, but it looked really odd like it was pulling together into a dough.  It poured out into the cake pans, and I actually had to wet my fingers down a bit and level it out a bit as the batter was that cohesive.    Secondly, realize this is a dark chocolate cake.  Some of my guests prefered more of a milk chocolate cake, but no one complained once they tasted it.    One huge suggestion...make this in advance!!!  It is so incredibly better the next day and after...  It seems to get moister as it sits.  Was a huge hit at the party and I'm grateful for the recipe!

My daughter specifically requested a homemade chocolate cake for her birthday--"Not from the store, momma.  Homemade."  My daughter is also one of the biggest chocoholics I know.  I have yet to run across a chocolate dessert that is too rich for her tastes so the hunt was most definitely on.  The "Too Much" part of this cake immediately caught my attention and, even though there is a cake (and pudding!) mix in the recipe, I decided it was close enough to homemade for our purposes.  I tweaked the general recipe by substituting *strong* coffee for the warm water--yes, I used the entire cup of oil!--and added 2/3c of milk and a tsp of vanilla.  I also added some peanut butter flavored chips along with the mini-chocolate chips and baked for an hour and five minutes.  Took the cake out, let cool, and then drizzled (slathered, perhaps?) the whole concoction in the Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  Oh, I placed some halved Reese's cups on there too--just to add to the overall decadence.  The cake?  Total win.  My daughter was delighted and could only finish one piece which should attest to the sheer richness of this cake.  A major hit with parents and kids.  For a not-from-scratch cake it was pretty close to heaven. :)

I decided to go ahead and give this recipe 5 stars.  Some reviewers knocked off one star because it still tastes like cake mix.  Of course it does, it IS cake mix, just with a few extras thrown in.  If you're looking for a 'from scratch' taste, this probably won't do it for you, but if you want a delicious, moist, EASY chocolate cake, this is definitely it!  I topped it off with Satiny Chocolate Glaze (also from this site) and drizzled milk chocolate over that.  Everyone loved it, and even though I'm one of those who prefers cakes from scratch, I will still be making this again.  It's too easy and too good not to.

To all Canadian bakers out there.  If you find your batter is too wet or too oily, take a look at the weight of your cake mix package.  Most cake mix boxes in Canada are sold in 432 grams packages and not like the United States where it's 18.25 ounce, which is equivalent to 517 grams.

I don't understand - I've never seen such rave reviews for a recipe, but this was not good at all to me.  It tasted bitter and powder-y.  It was very simple to make but I just did not like it.  The texture still seemed like a cake mix but with a worst taste.

I made this AGAIN, after it was requested by my husband, this time I didnt have the sour cream so I used 3/4 cup milk plus 1TB lemon juice (buttermilk) and 1/3 cup butter, It worked!! It was the same great cake that I expect out of this recipe. I also used regular choc. chips instead of the mini's that I had used. There was a difference, not bad (how bad can choc chips be?) but the minis really do distribute better, giving an even cakey texture, where the regulars leave pieces that you can feel in your mouth, neither bad just a texture preference. And I do hate to say it, (the base mix in this might ruin my cooking snob credibility lol)I guess can set out the sifter to distract the guests. I prefer the taste of this cake to the other highly rated (and good) scratch choc. cake. Thank you

this cake was awesome!!  followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit at our party.  I didn't have time to wait the recommended 1.5hrs to cool the cake before plating it.  I flipped it onto a plate after approx 5min while it was still hot and it held together perfectly.  I actually think it was better this way because it was still warm and the choc chips were melted and gooey.  Served immediately with ice cream and it was incredible!!

First I want to say that I am not a great baker but after reading all the reviews I had to give it a try..This was by far one of the best cakes I have had and my family agrees!!! I did make some adjustments to the recipe..I used coffee instead of H20, 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce, and 1c of semi-sweet chips along with 1c of peanut butter chips. Did not glaze the top, just powdered sugar..Baked for 55 minutes and came out perfect, moist, and delicious..I will be trying different flavor combinations!! This is a wonderful and easy recipe!!

I made this cake tonight.I used Chocolate Fudge cake mix since it was all I had. It was moist, I only used 3/4 cup of oil because I ran out, and then a 1/4 cup of half and half as another reviewer suggested. I baked it at 340 for about an hour. Everyone enjoyed it. If you like a moist chocolate cake you will love this.Edit 8/12/08: I had to give this recipe 5 instead of 4 stars. Everyone is asking for more cake! I actually had to hide the last peice to give to someone, and the family bickers about who gets it. My teenage daughter wants to attempt to make it with her friends, and she don't make cakes! Thanks again for a recipe I will use over and over. EDIT: I made this one week later, and used Devil's Food Cake. It was good, but not as good as the Chocolate Fudge cake. If you have this cake mix in your store get it!

Wow...very good.  I used a milk chocolate cake mix and mini chocolate chips and followed the recipe how it was.  Also, made it into a layer cake, using 3-9 inch round pans, spraying and baking them at 350 for 24 minutes and they turned out wonderful!  I love this with the chocolate fudge buttercream frosting recipe from this site- just be prepared for a chocolate overload!  Always a good thing though...

Made this with a couple of additions. To the water added one tablespoon instant espresso coffee. And, to the batter, folded in a half cup of toasted coconut. Awesome!

This is my favorite cake recipe.  I use it all the time.  I substitute cake, pudding, and chip flavors.  My favorite combination is white cake mix, vanilla pudding and white choc. chips.

BEST CAKE EVAR, just because its out of a box doesn't mean its bad. i used 1/2 cup oil instead of 1 and turn out great, ignore the crazy fools saying it tastes like box. lol i'm 16 and mastered it, easy! my dad made a cake from scratch and it turned out looking like sh*t. i win the bakeoff once again! i wish the crazy people 1staring this would learn how to cook, because its such a easy and good recipe nice and chocolaty with explosions of taste in your mouth.

Simply AMAZING. I did not change a thing in this recipe. Serve with dusted powder sugar and strawberries for garnish. This also makes great cupcakes, just cut down cooking time to about 20 minutes (toothpick test, as always). Everyone loved the cupcakes I made for my daughters 1st birthday. Great recipe, it's a keeper!

My daughter called this "the God-cake"... Whole family loved the depth of the chocolate. I liked being able to simply dress it in powdered sugar to make it more diet-friendly... or at least be able to have some. I used Reese's peanut butter chips, and everyone loved it. Next time, I'm going to use 1/2 pnut butter chips, and 1/2 choc chips., esp. as you're not getting a whole 2C of chips in a pkg anymore.... they don't make it easy. But, this cake is! SO EASY. 

For anyone with an underperforming gas oven, I used a dark nonstick Bundt pan, so reduced the oven temperature to 335, and took it out to test at the 57 minute mark, and it was PERFECT. I did grease the pan with butter, no flouring, and it inverted without any sticking. Fabulous recipe, fabulous flavor.

Tasted the chemical preservatives in the boxed mixes.   This isn't a replacement for a from scratch cake even with all the chocolate chips.  If you're used to making scratch cakes you'll be disappointed.  At least the it taught me to look at the low reviews as well as the average.

I made this cake for my "chocoholic" father's birthday. He loved it. The family loved it.  Everyone wants to know when I am going to make it again! I can see why this is an award-winning recipe - it's easy AND delicious!

This cake is excellent!  If you like those big chocholate "Otis Spunkmeyer" muffins, you'll love this cake...it's even better!  So rich and moist.  I made it for my co-workers..only had one piece to bring home to the family..now I'm making another for them..No such thing as TOO MUCH Chocolate!

Never to much Chocolate!  I made this the day before Thanksgiving.  I warmed up a jar of Hot Fudge (ice cream) topping and poured it over the cake.  Everyone loved it.

If I could give this more stars I would! Best recipe for cake or cupcakes that I have ever used. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I used the batter to make cupcakes - cooking them at 350 for 20 minutes - and they were perfect!  Huge hit at work and home.  Thanks for this amazing recipe!

This cake is... AMAZING! I had to use one less egg because I ran out, but it still was awesome! I made these into cupcakes, and they took 17 minutes to make! Then I cut a piece out of the top and filled it with a recipe I found, using 1/4 cup softened butter, 1/4 cup shortening, 3 tablespoons milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 2 cups confectioners sugar, and a pinch of salt! Beat all the ingredients together until fluffy! Then I made a frosting using 1/4 cup melted margarine, 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/3 cup milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 3 1/2 cups confectioners sugar. Fist blend the cocoa and margarine, then mix in the other ingredients! SOOOO good! Everything really complimented the cupcake! Thanks for this recipe!

I have made this cake for many years, an absolute favorite for my family. The only change I make is by adding a tsp of almond extract. It gives it a unique flavor that has people wondering what that "special" taste is.

We're not big cake lovers at my house, but everyone loved this.  We would all usually choose brownies or bars for dessert, but this cake could easily become our favorite dessert.  I followed the recipe exactly and topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze.  So, so good.

ADD ON:  Just made this again with a cream cheese sauce, 2 cups powdered sugar, 8 oz cream cheese, 1 Tbs butter, 1 Tbs water, 1 tsp vanilla.... mixed, microwaved and poured. Was wonderful with the chocolate! 

Wow! I did just as the recipe said and it was wonderful!  I'm glad I read the reviews first b/c I might have overcooked it if I didn't know that the melted chips would cause the toothpick test to to be a little tricky. I teamed this up with vanilla ice cream and the Satiny Chocolate Glaze for a Hot Fudge Cake type dessert and it was delightful!

This cake is so rich and delicious! Not for those who don't have a passion for triple chocolate cakes. I used Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies on the bottom of a cupcake and made a Thin Mint-style buttercream to top it. Together they made a tasty version of the cookie that washed down well with a glass of milk. I will definitely be adding this to my recipe repetoire because it pleases all who eat it!! (BTW - If you use it for cupcakes like I did, be warned that it makes approximately three dozen regular cupcakes, so plan on having a lot. I baked mine for 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees and they turned out great!)

This cake certainly lives up to its name. This is very rich. I substituted 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce for the oil, used miniature chocolate chips, and made this into cupcakes. I baked for 18 minutes using standard muffin pans (with liners), and they came out fluffy. I dusted the cupcakes with powdered sugar.

I used Duncan Hines cake mix and followed the recipe to a T. The cake was really good, but there was nothing extraordinary about it. It tasted like normal cake mix and the extra ingredients didn't add anything special to it.

Good, moist cake.  I agree with another reviewer that I don't see what all the fuss is about, however.

I'm pretty sure the temperature should be 325 instead of 350 degrees (according to an oven thermometer, over temps vary), because the cake was ever so slightly burned on the outside but perfect on the inside both times I made it.

To tell you the truth, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong - this was a good chocolate cake, but I was not blown away. I will continue my conquest for true chocolate bliss. In the meantime, don't get your hopes up too high for this recipe. Thanks anyway.

I've yet to make this in a Bundt pan but this is my go-to recipe for sheet cake, layer cakes, cupcakes, etc.  The chocolate chips make the cake denser & too flat so I usually leave them out.  My favorite is vanilla cake with vanilla pudding.  I bake it in a jelly roll or cookie sheet pan (25 minutes) and use a biscuit cutter to make little mini cakes.  Put pie filling between the layers and top with whipped cream.  I did these in 1/2 pint mason jars and they were a HUGE hit.  I make mini muffins with the chocolate (& use mini chips) and they are like brownie bites.  Trust your nose when baking.  Generally, when you start to smell whatever you are baking it's either done or close to being done.

Ok so I made this with a butter recipe cake mix, vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips, but other than that didn't change a thing. And DON'T! I'm in Florida, so no high elevations to deal with and I found no need to change the oil amount. I cooked in two 9" round pans for 40 mins and they were perfect! Frosted with cream cheese icing, yum!

I have made this several times and everyone always compliments me and asks for seconds - adults and kids.  Just wanted to add that you can use extra virgin olive oil and I think it tastes even better.  My housemate that hates olive oil can't tell.

This was a great cake! I followed the recipe exactly. Not sure why some did not work out for others and they had to reduce the oil. Maybe they had a thinner pan (??). Anyway follow the recipe and oil the pan REALLY well and you will have a super easy hit.

This cake was awesome! I even forgot to put in the chocolate chips, and it was still divine! I would like to note that the cake was a very dense cake, but it was incredibly moist and delicious. One thing that I did find is that the batter is VERY thick, almost like a thin dough-I attributed this to the instant pudding mix thickening up. This didn't affect the end result, but it was not what I was expecting during the mixing process. The recipe states to use a 12-cup bundt pan, but all I had was a 9-cup and it worked out fine. I simply trimmed the raised portion after cooling before inverting the cake. I took the advice of some other reviewers and lowered the temperature down to 325 after the first 30 minutes, and this seemed to help the inside cook thoroughly without creating crusty edges. I did have to increase the cook time to about 60-70 minutes total, though.

Delicious, super easy & a major crowd pleaser! The only thing I did different was use mini chocolate chips instead of regular. I think they work better in a cake. I will definitely use this recipe again and can't wait to experiment with different flavor combinations per some of the reviews I was reading. Thank you for a great go-to recipe!

This cake is amazing.  I even had people who don't like chocolate trying this cake and they loved it!

I also made a vanilla version of this cake.  I used french vanilla pudding and cake mix and white chocolate chips.  It turned out great!

Prior to making this I read several pages of reviews. For reviews less than 4 or 5 stars I thought or reasons for the review's displeasure such as using an inexpensive cake mix, personal preference etc.  After all 1400 reviewer's can't be wrong- can they? Well yes IMHO they are!! I followed the directions exactly and this was the absolutely worst cake I have every made and the only one neither my family or myself wouldn't eat.The taste of chemicals was overwhelming- something I have never experienced from any food prior to this. Stick with Crazy Cake- it's an oldie but a goodie.

I made this for my husband's birthday since he LOVES chocolate cake.  I used a reduced sugar cake mix, and was worried that the cake wouldn't be sweet enough.  It was excellent and my husband loved it.  FYI...to prevent your chocolate chips from sinking to the bottom of the cake during baking, combine chips with a dusting of flour in a small bowl before adding them to the batter.  Works every time! Thanks for this recipe!!

I was really excited to make this for my daughters birthday as chocolate cake is her favorite.  We all only had one piece and most didn't finish it.  Just didn't taste right.

Cupcakes! Subbed coffee for hot water, 1/3 c milk and 2/3 c oil, and mini chips.  I cooked at 350 for about 20 minutes and these cupcakes are my new favorite chocolate cake.  Not oily or fudgey, no overcooked edges- just a nice, rich cake.  My kids, who normally lick the frosting off and take a few bites of cake, ate the whole cupcake with no frosting.

Have made this three times now...and every time has been a big hit!  I must warn you though...be prepared to be craving chocolate cake for a long time after...the smell is so good, and seemed to linger long after the cake was gone, that I kept wanting to go a cut a slice, only to be disappointed that there was none.  So chocolately, rich and moist. Will satisfy any chocolate lover.  I used Betty Crocker Devil's Food cake mix, didn't give the "cake box" taste as the Duncan Hines mix did.  Need 1 box plus 1/3 cup from another mix to have the right amount though.  I also used Jello brand plain instant chocolate pudding - needed 1 and a 1/2 packages.  I do use the full cup of oil.  I tried it with full fat, and 5% fat sour cream.  Both were excellent.  Enjoy!

Best cake ever!!! Such wonderful chocolate flavor and very moist. I was very pleased. Instead of dusting it with powdered sugar, I drizzled a cream cheese frosting on it. 
Cream Cheese Icing:
4oz. cream cheese (softened)
1 Tbls. Butter (softened)
2 Cups Powdered Sugar
½ tsp. vanilla

Whip all together with mixer until smooth. Nook in microwave for 10-15 seconds to drizzle over your bundt cake.

Forget the vegetable oil debate - just use ROOM TEMPERATURE BUTTER and HOT (rather than warm) water to make the batter manageable. It will still be very thick - you have to spread it more than pour it in to the pan - but OMG, this is an insanely easy/good recipe! Sprinkle with a non-melting powdered sugar and leave it alone - frosting this gem would be just gilding the lily. BTW, I added 1 t. of peppermint extract for the holidays and it was even better - peppermint bark cake! Mmmm!
P.S. - I was really lazy the night I made this and only used canola oil Pam rather than greasing/flouring the pan the way I normally would. I only let it rest about 5 minutes out of the oven and it released PERFECTLY. As long as you're baking the cake the proper amount of time, I don't understand why you'd have to let it cool completely in the pan. It's a great recipe - just USE BUTTER and enjoy!! LOL

I have made this many times - definitely my "go-to" chocolate cake!  
The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  Only thing I didn't like was the difficulty in cutting once the chocolate chips hardened.  Otherwise - YUM!!  
The second time, I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce.  Also, I refrigerated the chocolate chips for about an hours, then put them through a food processor until they were finely chopped.  I LOVED the way this turned out!  That's what I'm sticking to from now on.  

For anyone who says this cake is dry - you are OVER BAKING!

Super yummy! Used to make cupcakes, made about 36; on 350 for maybe 20 min? Substituted coffee for the water and used mini chips, other wise followed to a T. Frosted with the Hershey's chocolate butter cream recipe on the label, except I almost double the cocoa and added about a 1T of Pilon instant espresso. Warning- for serious chocolate lovers only! YUM!!!!

This is absolutely fantastic! 
I love using mini-chocolate chips. 
I have found that the pudding mix doesn't make much of a difference, so if you don't have it, don't worry.
Don't overcook it!

This always turns out amazing! I've also tried it with a caramel cake mix and butterscotch pudding (you have to add a little vanilla so you still have the caramel flavor). Yum!!

*Edited review.  My original suggestion was to use foil cupcake liners  for cupcakes, otherwise chocolate chips stick to the bottom of the cupcakes and stay there.  My newest suggestion is to use a cake mix extender if you like to make layer cakes like I do. Remember how big and pretty layer cakes were when cake mixes were 18.25 ounces instead of 15.25 - 16.25 ounces? I mix the cake ingredients as written but then I use  a Duncan Heinz cake extender recipe. Mix together 3/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup oil, 1 egg and 1 tablespoon cocoa powder in a medium bowl. Stir into your already mixed, cake mix batter. Bake per directions in recipe. This also works well on other cake mix recipes. Simply omit the cocoa powder and use different flavored extracts depending on what cake you're making. When making a white cake, just use the egg white.

Holy Chocolate, Batman!!!!  This is seriously not for the weak.  You have to be a true chocoholic to appreciate the beauty that is this cake.  Wow.  I don't have a bundt pan so I made it into a 2 layer cake, and because this didn't have enough chocolate, I put chocolate fudge frosting (store-bought) in the middle and topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze mentioned below.  Then, I decorated it with raspberries.  The glaze and the raspberries were done by a 6 and a 9 yr old, so it was very adorable.  The cake was huge.  I also added 1/2 c. of brewed coffee instead of water, just to bring out the chocolate even more.  So delicious. NOTE:  the two layers took a little longer to cook than what the box said, i think they ended cooking for about 35-40 minutes.  If you're going to try it this way, make sure to keep a close eye the last few minutes.

This cake was delicious!  I made it just as the recipe is written, used Ghiardelli chips (make a world of difference in taste) and seriously, there were a few of us hiding in the bedroom with a gallon of milk eating the last few peices!  Super easy, quick and yum!

After making this for ladies meeting at my church, I have gained a reputation for this cake, and I was told that I must bring this particular cake whenever I am invited somewhere.  Very delicious and moist.  I have topped the cake with homemade chocolate glaze and powdered sugar on different occasions, and the cake tasted great with either!  It is delicious!  After it cools completely and is flipped onto a plate, I put chocolate covered strawberries in the middle.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't quite cook through for me so I added another 10 minutes and it still had areas that were not cooked through.  If I made it again, I think I'd go w/ making two layers instead.  The flavor was outstanding!  My hubby is still talking about this cake and it was over a month ago that I made it.  Will definitely make it again, but try to "lighten" it up next time.

I have a version of this cake that makes it even more wonderful!  first, decrease oil to 1/2 cup, then add:  1/4 cup Kahlua, 2 tbsp FRESH grated orange rind (I once tried the dried stuff, ecch), and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I usually serve it by just dusting the top with powdered sugar.

I usually use devil's food cake mix, chocolate fudge instant pudding,  and mini chocolate chips.

Very moist and rich cake. I used 8 oz of applesauce in place of the oil and mini chocolate morsels. It took 58 min to bake in the bundt pan. Made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site which was delicious. The cake really does not need the glaze, next time I will sprinkle it with powdered sugar and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

This recipe is wonderful.  I did reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and then added 1/4 cup of milk and it came out great.  I also made cupcakes with this recipe and baked them at 350 for 20-22 minutes.  I iced them with the Chocolate Cheese Frosting on this site and everyone at work loved them.

My mom and I have made this cake for several different occasions, and each time we have received praise and compliments for it. Everyone loves this cake! Of course, I always fail to mention that it actually wasn't made from scratch;) No one ever suspects a box mix was put into it. I've had many of my friends ask me to make it again and again. When I converted this recipe to a vanilla cake I used vanilla chocolate chips and vanilla pudding with all of the same measurements. I would suggest using a little less oil when making a vanilla version. I have not only made this cake in a bundt pan but also in an average sheet cake pan. I believe it takes less time when using a normal pan verses a bundt pan. Just use the toothpick trick and your best judgement when baking. This cake will forever be my go to dessert when trying to impress! I

This recipe is perfect for the ultimate chocolate lover. I made it exactly as the recipe said, but in a 9x13 pan and it turned out perfect. I baked it for about 50 minutes. About an hour after I took the cake out of the oven, I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze. The recipe for that can be found on this site. I doubled the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe, and it was perfect. If anyone gives this cake a bad rating, it's because they messed up, they don't really like chocolate in the first place, or they didn't exactly follow the recipe. Also, to prevent the chocolate chips from sinking to the bottom of the cake, I lightly coated them in flour before putting them in the mix. I'll be making this cake again, and again, and again!!

Great cake but 1st choice is Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake from this sight. I made this because I didn't have 16 oz. of sour cream. I used mini chocolate chips which leaves every mouthful a bit of chocolate heaven. I greased & cocoa the pan so there is no white cake flour residue on cake. Pans should be greased & "floured" or use unsweetened baking cocoa for chocolate cakes & flour for white cakes. Release is easier. If not frosted,cake will look good. I use a simple mousse filling/frosting. 1 instant chocolate pudding, 1 Tablespoon baking cocoa, 1/4 cup powder sugar & 3/4 cup milk. Beat till thick & fold in 8 oz. cool whip.

I've been making this recipe since the late 1960s! Always a favorite! but I use only 1/2c. of oil. Also sometimes instead of water I use very strong coffee. Or add liquors or flavorings. It does not dry out, lasts for days, I've done a raspberry jam glaze, we even used this as the base recipe for our wedding cake. And I've had it and a Rum-Pecan Bundt cake on the menu at my restaurant in Aspen since 1972, still a top seller!

Have made it in a 9 x 13 for church, and just put a purchased,rich fudge icing on it that I added more chopped pecans to. The women thought it was to die for!!! Well, hello! Oops, forgot to say I also add 1 sort of rounded Tablespoon Instant Coffee granules to the warm water, and 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Butter & Nut flavoring.

I really like to use a good purchased Fudge Cake recipe & Icing for this cake, too.

I love this recipe and have made it MANY times!!! You can use any chocolate cake mix. DO NOT listen to anyone about changing oil,etc. It is perfect the way it is. It is supposed to be super moist and when the middle is not firm, well that is the way it should be. My twelve year old can make this cake so anyone should be able to. Quick tip, any time you use chocolate chips in a recipe lightly coat with flour and they will not sink to the bottom.

Does anybody remember the movie "Matilda"? Where the little girl has magic powers, and her evil principal makes a little boy eat an entire chocolate cake? THIS IS THAT CAKE. 
Delicious in every way! Followed the recipe exactly, let it bake for 60 minutes because when I poked it, it seemed "jiggly." To everyone who thought their cake wouldn't bake: that's just the way this cake is when it's hot. The consistency is very unique, so trust your timer. It will seem too soft, but it will hold up and come out just fine.

After reading some of the reviews, I took Naples34102's advice and added vanilla extract and used strong brewed coffee for the water. I also used mini chips as many others did. I followed everything else as written, including the baking instructions, which were spot on. Don't ignore the directive to let the cake cool completely in the pan as it's structure is very soft and moist when warm. The cake was quite chocolatey, but not too sweet or rich. It could take a chocolate glaze, but I went with powdered sugar sifted over the top. I would make this again as I enjoyed it and everyone else raved over it.

I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix and 1/2 cup of strong coffee in place of the warm water. Then I added only 1 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, I used the rest of the chips to make the Satiny Chocolate glaze recipe from this site. The results were an extremely moist, deeply intense chocolate cake. Received rave reviews.

Wow, wow, wow!!  I made this today.  I did make a "lower" fat version using SF pudding mix, FF sour cream, and unsweetened applesauce (instead of oil).  I used the mini chips others suggested.  It made 34 regular sized cupcakes, which I baked at 350 for 17 minutes.  For anyone on WW they are only 4 pts/cupcake using the subs.  I will be saving 4 pts a day to indulge in this unbelievably moist, amazingly chocolately bit of heaven!

I made 4 batches of this & turned it into a pirate ship covered with fondant for my daughters 5th birthday party... I had to make it 3 days ahead of time... It was AMAZING!  It was all eaten up!  The only thing I changed was that I took the suggestion of using mini chocolate chips instead of regular sized.  This is my go to chocolate cake now!! Update: made cupcakes & used "Really Good Frosting" recipe from this site & they turned out great!  Bake them at 350 for 24 mins if you fill them at 3/4.
***Update:  I have been using this recipe as a base now for all kinds of variations!  I am making a "Frozen" themed ice cream cake for my daughter's birthday party and am using this; however I am switching it to white cake with vanilla pudding.  I have done these types of variations with this recipe with great success.  I also have used different juices in place of the water... all with fantastic success.  Love this recipe!

Delicious even tho I ran out of sour cream and oil and had to adjust (yielding a less caloric but scrupmtious cake). I used triple chocolate cake mix, choc pudding mix, 1/3 c light sour cream, 1 cup 1% milk (to replace the water and half the oil), 2/3 cup 1 % milk + 1 T vinegar (set 5 min- to replace the rest of the sour cream), 1/2 c oil, 4 egg whites + 1 egg, 2 c milk chocolate chips, chopped up smaller so they wouldn't sink; added 1 tsp vanilla, and glazed with Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze from this site, made with nonfat condensed milk and milk chocolate chips.  Excellent recipe, very forgiving, and I do not see how you could go wrong with this recipe.  I am sure it would be even more decadent as written, and it baked beautifully in my bundt pan. Thanks!

This was oustanding.  I don't even *love* chocolate, but I loved this cake.  The only change I made was to use mini chocolate chips instead of regular.  Everyone I served this too couldn't get enough.  This is a definitely keeper, moistest cake I've ever eaten.

This cake is delicious.  I made the cake exactly as written and then I melted some chocolate frosting and drizzled it over the top of the cake and sprinkled it with mini chocolate chips.  It was beautifully sinful!

It’s AWESOME and definitely a 5-star recipe!   As I am new in baking, I ensured that I read & fully understood the recipe for 5 times & got all items ready & checked prior to starting. As per someone's advice; in order to avoid chocolate chips from sinking, I tossed them with a tbsp of flour, properly greased my pan  & even added beaten eggs one at a time as I was determined to bake my 1st ever birthday cake.  Followed recipe to T. except minor changes of oil reduction to ½ cup & semi-sweet chocolate chips reduction to 1 cup to save the extra CAL  However, an "exciting baking drama” unfolded soon! First, my new mixer just stopped abruptly due to too-thick batter, & then realized that I missed out the 1/2 cup of warm water set aside but was quick to add in time.  Baked the cake in a new oven using a 10" spring form pan for 35 minutes as tester came out clean. To my horror, the upper part and bottom part of the cake was hard like rocks and cracked as well! I had to trim off those unwanted parts to salvage whatever left in the end... Maybe something has gone wrong with my newly bought oven.  Like others, I coated the cake with "Sanity Chocolate Glaze" from this site & with all above blunders, hubby said it was such a divine as it's so much taster than those store-bought cakes from a renowned bakery chain & it's even tastier & more cholocaty on the next day. Thanks so much, Denise for such a wonderful recipe which has added so much fun and excitement (both expected & unexpected)

Excellent, stays moist for days...actually best after a day of setting and has cooled down.  Not a real sweet chocolate cake - absolutely fabulous!

Delicious!  My brother said it was the best cake he's ever had.  I served it with peanut butter frosting... great combo, and it broke up the intense chocolate flavor some.
A few changes, based on other's suggestions:  instead of a cup of oil, I used a half cup of oil and a half cup of skim milk.  I also used a half a cup of coffee instead of water to bring out the chocolate flavor.  I used two cups of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I did not have any trouble with the cakes sticking to the pan.  I baked it at 325 (I was using two 9 inch round dark non-stick pans) for 38 minutes.  Came out wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe!

I made this recipe with a few slight modifications for my mother's birthday, and she's convinced I could make some money on the side baking desserts! She says this was very close to a chocolate mousse cake, and that it is restaurant quality when served with some whipped cream/cool whip.

My modifications: I bought cake mix that already had pudding mix in it, but still added a 3.8 ounce box of pudding to it. I also cut the oil to 3/4 cup, used mini chips, and added a splash of milk for consistency. It baked up perfectly in 50 minutes, slid from the pan an hour later, and was extremely moist.

I made this and it was indeed very very chocolatey! Very nmoist and rich. I replaced the water with espresso as someone else suggested on this site. I used light sour cream. Will definately make it again!

This cake was pretty good.  It's not the best, not the worst I've had.  Easy to make.  I probably won't make it again though.

This was not very good at all- first it took forever to bake and then when it was finally done the outside was hard as a rock- flavor wasn't that great either- would never make again.

I followed the suggestions of others to reduce the calories at least a bit-- sugar-free pudding, fat-free sour cream, more water and less oil-- and it still tasted great. I baked cupcakes for 20 minutes or so for my son's birthday party. They were a hit. Everyone commented on the chocolate chips. I guess they were an unexpected surprise.

I have had a similar recipe for years and it makes the best cake!  My difference is instead of the water, add 1/2 c. Kahlua liquor.  It is sooo good!

OK I found this recipe yesterday as I needed to make a friend a birthday cake.  Everyone loved the richness of the cake and how moist it was to the taste.  I used the satiny chocolate glace to drizzle. One more find for the recipe book!

Love this cake recipe.  I used dark chocolate frosting and candy melts to make the front of this owl.  These are for a little birthday party.  This cake is moist and versatile. I will use it again and again!

Very moist and delicious.  I got requests for the recipe and many compliments.  I would follow the suggestion from another post and use a lower temperature for baking next time, since the top gets a little overdone while waiting for the cake to cook through.  One person suggested 1/2 c. oil and only 335 degrees... may try that next time.

This is a really good cake! I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil, and fat free pudding and I used mini chocolate chips the regular one sink to the bottom. It probably took off 200 calories.

This is an absolutely AWESOME recipe.  I used 9" round cake pans and made a layer cake.  I also used about 1/2 a bag of mini chocolate chips, which was perfect.  I used a simple ganache recipe and topped the cake off with shaved chocolate.  It was an absolute hit!  I will definately be using this recipe in the future.

Best chocolate cake ever.  Perfect amount of chocolate.  It was dense, but so very moist.  I would avoid the glaze.  It was horribly clumpy and didn't drizzle like the picture.

This cake was incredible!  I followed exactly as directions stated -- well I guess I did one minor change... used mini chocolate chips --- and I will definelty be making this again.  Whenever I think of cake I always think of icing as well but this cake does not need it.  A definite must for everyone to try!

First time I made this I forgot the sour cream and it was still really good!  The next time I added the sour cream and some chopped walnuts and it was really really good!  Served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  A keeper.

Great recipe! Just follow it exactly, don't change it like all these people said. I even forgot to put the chips into the batter, and still yummy and super moist! The outside didn't get burned on mine, and was perfectly done after 45 minutes. I added a Duncan Hines vanilla glaze (in a bottle) to the top, and some mini chocolate chips. Going to try a red velvet version this weekend and put cream cheese frosting on it!

UPDATE: made with red velvet cake mix, vanilla pudding (no choc chips) and a cream cheese frosting. TO DIE FOR. This is my forever cake recipe now! Thank you!

this was crazy good!!!  To quote my husband, it was "unbelievable".  I did not have a bundt pan so I used a muffin pan and baked them at 350 for 25minutes.  Also, I only had 1 cup of choc chips so i used a Lindt Easter bunny which I chopped up and added.  Biting into those morsels of melted milk chocolate was heavenly! 
I've tasted other variations of this recipe but none blew me away like this.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I might try mini chocolate chips next time because the regular sized ones didn't melt, but I got a lot of compliments on the recipe as-is so no changes are really needed.  I made cupcakes instead of a cake, baking them in a 350 degree F oven for 20-25 minutes.  I also iced the cupcakes using the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website.  The recipe made two dozen cupcakes; I put one dozen in the freezer for later (without glaze), and when defrosted I made fresh glaze for them.  They were still delicious and super moist so I'll definitely continue to freeze these cupcakes in the future so we're not stuck eating two dozen cupcakes in one go.

Yum yum yum! Awesome chocolate cake which taste great with a peanut butter frosting! I baked this cake in two 8 inch rounds and noticed that the chocolate chips burned to the bottom of the pans. Next time I might try pouring a small amount of batter without chocolate chips on the bottoms of the pans, then mixing the chips into the rest of the batter and pouring that on top.

This recipe is a keeper!!  Delicious cake that tastes like it's from scratch.  I used mini chips and made mini cupcakes topped with chocolate ganache.  Delish.  I baked the cupcakes for 12 minutes at 350.  Thanks for the recipe.

Edit: I cannot help myself but edit. This is my go to chocolate cake recipe and people LOVE it!!!!!  So worth it.

Love this cake!  I had this recipe back in the 70's and it got misplaced.  I'm happy to find it again.  This cake is rich and chocolatey.  Doesn't need frosting--a sprinkle of powdered sugar will do.

F.A.B.U.L.O.U.S. R.E.C.I.P.E. My daughter and I were asked to make 200 cupcakes for an event. 100 were to be chocolate and this is the recipe we used. We did omit the chocolate chips because they didn't want them, but the next time I make this for myself, I will include them. Baked them for 20 minutes at 350 and they were perfect.

I followed the recipe as written (except for mini chocolate chips) and made it into cupcakes with a cream cheese frosting.  A huge hit at the office.  This will be my "go to" chocolate cake recipe.

This is one of the best cake recipes I've ever made. Even my husband loved it (and he's hard to impress)! I loved playing with different combinations of cake mixes and pudding mixes. My favorite was french vanilla cake mix and french vanilla pudding mix with dark chocolate chunks! So delicious! Last week, I made it with strawberry cake mix and lemon pudding with a lemon buttercream frosting. It tasted delicious, light and fresh! I will be using this recipe often!

Oh, Em, Gee!   This is a wonderful recipe.  I baked it in my PC flan pans as the base for cream cheese/cherry pie filling.  It's going to be out of this world.  Because I was rushing, I was a little sloppy in measuring the oil and water and forgot to use warm water...it still is wonderful.  It yielded the two flan pans plus a small corning ware dish that we could sample.  Cakes for dual birthdays at the office Thursday.   I used the Pillsbury Moist Supreme Devils Food which has pudding already in it so I didn't add any more.  I baked it for 25 mins. at 350...perfect.

This is hands-down one of the best cakes I've ever had. I was doubtful at first because the batter seemed so thick and I had to stir it by hand (it almost killed my little hand mixer), but I went with it, and I made it in 10inch and 6inch pans in absence of a bundt pan. Both layers came out wonderful! I stacked them and made a sauce out of a large handful of chocolate chips, melted, half a pkg of instant chocolate pudding mix, and milk to desired consistency. We had it warm, with vanilla ice cream. It was absolutely to die for! :)

Wow! This was the best cake ever. I used a 9x13 pan and 1/2 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesause. Baked for the time used for a regular cake and it was perfect. This tops my mother-in-laws awesome chocolate cake, and i didn't think that was possible. This was a HUGE hit with my boss. This is a keeper.

Was really excited to make this cake as my family LOVES chocolate.  But the cake was borderline 'undone' on the inside and overdone on the outside, in fact a bunch of the batter overflowed through the middle hole of my bundt pan (the large size bundt pan!) and burned on the floor of my oven.  THAT was fun.   The texture was kinda gross- rubbery and thick and clunky.   I would rather have just made the cake mix because the texture would have been better...  sorry, I won't be making this again...

Hands down, the best chocolate cake I've ever had. I loved the picture posted so I baked the cake in a Bundt pan and once it cooled, I heated chocolate frosting in the microwave (at 15 second intervals) until it was warm enough to pour. Then I slowly poured the icing all along the rim of the cake and it oozed down the sides, shiny and beautiful. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I love this cake.  I've never had a problem with regular chocolate chips sinking (the batter is very thick), but I do prefer the texture of the mini choc chips. This cake is good same day, but SO much better the next day.  I always prepare it a day ahead.

So dense and so good. I made this for a baking sale, and it sold like crazy. I added 2 tbs cocoa powder for more chocolaty madness, used plain yogurt for the sour cream, and subbed in applesauce for the oil. The richness is unbelievable.

Wonderful! Moist, rich, and chocolaty. I used the mini chips. I will reduce baking temp next time to 335 or 325 becuase the outer edge was a little dry. I used a ganache topping and finished it with grated white chocolate. Nice presentation. I will make this one many more times.

This is a great chocolate cake and so easy to make!  Is there a such thing as too much chocolate?  I made the cake using two pans to make a double layer cake.  I didn't even need all the batter though.  Made such a rich, dark, chocolatey cake.  I used a chocolate sour cream frosting and it's marvelous.

Accidently left out the chocolate chips. Just tasted like a doctored up cake mix. You could def taste the mix. Made them in cupcake form, baked for 20 min. They came out fine although deflated when they came out of the oven. There's a better doctored chocolate cake on Allrecipes that I'd rather use.

This is a great doctored cake mix recipe and you can customize it by using different cake flavors, chips, and pudding mixes. I found that 1 cup of oil is simply way too much, I cut it down to 1/2 when I made it the second time and it was far better. Swapping out the warm water for 1/2 cup of milk is also a good idea. As written, this is a very good cake but with too much oil, so I say 4 stars. Cut down on the oil and use milk rather than water and it's a five star cake!

This cake was possibly THE best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. Since the cake and pudding mixes are now smaller than what the original recipe called for, I used  slightly less oil but kept all other measurements the same. Made it for a co-workers birthday and it was such a hit I'll make it again for Thanksgiving!

Followed step by step and it turned out awesome!! The only thing is that it needed about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated. Omg though 600 calories per slice??!!!! I won't be eating dinner next time I have a slice of this!

This cake was delicious! Followed recipe as stated. Baked in a stoneware bundt cake pan and sprayed it with PAM. Sprinkled with the powdered sugar when completely cooled!!! Next time I want to drizzle with chocolate ganache, yes I'm a chocoholic :) Very chocolately!

OMG, this cake is incredible! I did brew some strong coffee to use in place of the water...yumm....coffee seems to bring out the flavor of chocolate nicely.  I didn't have chocolate pudding on hand so used vanilla pudding and added about 1/4 cup cocoa.  Worked Well.  Don't be afraid of using the full cup of oil....this recipe is perfect.  I used regular sized chocolate chips....I had no problem with the chips sinking. Your batter should be very thick. They stayed suspended for me fine and the nice big bite of chocolate is wonderful.  Like so many others, I used the silky chocolate glaze.  I garnished with chopped pecans PERFECT!!!  My son isn't wild about chocolate, his flavor is lemon.  But I made this for my birthday cake.  Gave him some and he loved it.  He said it was the best chocolate cake he'd ever had!   My substitution of the pudding was fine.  I just didn't want to run to store lol.  But try the coffee....my only suggestion to change.  Will be making again and will be on the desert table for thanksgiving this year! Thanks for sharing!

This is the best, most rich, moist chocolate cake that I have ever made. I am a major chocoholic and so is the hubby. Needless to say we both loved the cake. Made the recipe as is except for substituting freshly brewed coffee for the 1/2 cup of warm water. The coffee definitely brought out the richness in the chocolate. Made the recipe with chocolate ganache frosting from another site. It was delicious. I did not use a bundt pan as I do not own one. Instead substituted the bundt pan for two 9" round came pans. Baked for 50 mins but will bake for 45 next time given that the edges were a bit too crisp. The cake however was excellent. Two thumbs up!!

Very chocolatey!! I used a a cake mix and pudding mix with different ounces than the recipes calls for - just whatever they had in the store. And I cut the chocolate chips to about 1.5 cups. Cooked 55 minutes in a bundt pan and it came out very moist. Chocolate chips did not sink as some people mentioned, they stayed pretty even throughout the batter. My coworkers said they liked it; I found it to be a little too much chocolate! Well-named, Denise. But if you like things that are very sweet or very chocolately you should definitely go for it. :-)

Delicious chocolate cake and very easy to put together.  I made cupcakes and baked them for about 25 minutes - they turned out perfectly.  I didn't use a whole cup of oil - about 3/4 cup - just because that was all I had.  I also used mini chocolate chips.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

I use mini chocolate chips so they won't sink to the bottom of the pan... (if you do not have any at home, you can mix the chips with flour just to coat them and then add them to the batter; this prevents them from sinking). We love this cake!

I don't usually take the time to rate and review recipes on here, but I had to with this one.  This is by far the BEST chocolate cake I have EVER had!!!!!!!  I was hesitant of the sour cream, but you can't taste it at all, and it really does make it so much more moist!!!  I didn't have chocolate chips on hand, so I used 3 large chocolate baking squares, melted them, then added them to the batter.  I know that the recipe says you dont need a frosting, but being a chocoholic, I drizzled hot fudge over the top of my cake.  Tastes similar to but better than the molten lava cakes you can get at restaurants!!!!  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!!!!!!

This has been my go-to cake recipe for 2 years now.  The chocolate cake is phenomenal (try it sometime with coffee instead of the water).  I have also tried it with banana cake & pudding mix with cinnamon chips, butter pecan cake mix with butterscotch pudding mix & chips.  In Oct/Nov/Dec you can get pumpkin spice, gingerbread & candy cane pudding mixes.  Try the pumpkin & gingerbread puddings with a spice cake mix & candy cane pudding with a white cake mix.  The flavor combinations are limited only by your creativity.  The chocolate cake is good topped with powdered sugar or with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.

This cake is INSANE. First off, I am a TERRIBLE cook, so when I give something five stars its because its easy and amazing (and foolproof! : ).  I made this last night and as per other reviews, instead of the full cup of oil I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. I also used mini chocolate chips and sugar free instant pudding, so the whole thing was a bit healthier. I baked it in two 8 inch round cake pans for about 35-40 minutes and then put it together like a regular layer cake. For the frosting I used the recipe for satiny chocolate glaze on this site and.....wow. It is so good. I will make this again and again and AGAIN!!! It is amazing with or without the frosting, though I prefer with!

I have made this recipe twice in a month, both times into 30 cupcakes using #30 scoop. The first time I followed another suggestion and used tiny chips but it was hard to tell they were their.  Second time I used larger chips and sprinkled them on top of cupcakes pressing down slightly( I was afraid that chips would sink to bottom) & I also used coffee instead of water. Chips stayed at top and I used less than recipe suggested....it was plenty.  Cupcakes stay moist for days as I just traveled with them for my sons birthday. Really great recipe!!!

Made great cupcakes! Used small box pudding, coffee for water and added 1/2 tsp. almond extract which was very subtle. Frosted with butter cream frosting. Couldn't be better!

Subbed in plain, non-fat yogurt for sour cream, cut oil to 3/4 cup, chocolate chips to 1.5 cups (flour them so they don't sink), and used a 3.9 oz. instant pudding package. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes, then turned down to 325 for 25 minutes. Came out perfectly moist, but not too mushy. Filled the hole in the center with chocolate-covered strawberries made using the same Satiny Chocolate Glaze I topped the cake off with. The recipient (a total chocaholic) declared it "lethal." Will definitely make again!

ok, with over 3000 reviews who needs another?  Well, here's my 2cents.  This recipe is good!  I didn't have a bundt pan, so I made cupcakes and baked for 22 mins.  They turned out FANTASTIC.  It didn't taste like a "box" cake.  Simply delicious.  Didn't change a thing - though I think I will add Kahlua for an adult cupcake version.  Make this...you won't be disappointed. 3/3/12 UPDATE: adult version :) - used 1/2 cup + more of Kahlua instead of the warm water.  FANTASTIC!!!

Excellent recipe! I made this wonderful cake for a co-worker's birthday. I just dusted the top with powdered sugar. Very pretty cake!
It was really light and had so much chocolate flavor. I used milk chocolate chips instead of the semisweet chips. A+++++!

I made this cake a couple of days ago, i invited our friends two sons over for supper the other night, and i served this for dessert it was very good and if you love chocolate then this is your cake! i followed it almost exactly except i cut back on the oil just a bit, if you want a nice moist cake i wouldn't cut the oil back by a huge amount, but certiantly somewhat for sure.
I didn't have a bundt pan so i used a tube pan and it turned out great.
I am not a huge chocolate lover but for  all those of you who are try this recipe and don't change it at all except for cutting back on the oil some, you will love it, we all did!!

This turned out delicious!  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and replaced half of the oil with milk.  I ended up making it in an 8x8 pan and 12 muffin tins because i didn't have a bundt pan.  My muffins collapsed but the cake had a decent shape... not sure what happened there.  Still, even thought they weren't pretty, they tasted great!

We loved this cake.  I made it twice in one week--one for a co-worker and one for my family.  In both cases, it was gone before the week was up.  The second time I made the mistake of only adding 3 eggs and it didn't make any difference in taste or texture.

I've been making this cake for 30 years.  Got it from a cookbook published by a defunct restaurant in Dallas called the something Turtle.  Don't have the cookbook anymore but still have the recipe.  Original recipe calls for 1/2 cup oil and 3/4 cup water.  I make muffins by sprayig muffin cups liberally with cooking spray and bake for 20 minutes.  Let cool in pan for a couple of minutes before removing. No need for frosting.

Everybody loves this cake and it gets eaten up very quickly. It is rich and I have used it several times. I have even used the lemon cake, with lemon pudding and lemonade instead of warm water. Delicious

Thank you so much Denise.  Your cake is decadent and dense, chocolatey but not overly sweet.  It really is a perfect, fudgey chocolate cake.  I cooked mine in a silicone mold (placed on a baking sheet for stability and ease of removal from the oven) and needed an extra 10 minutes for baking.  My family thanks you for this incredible recipe.

This is the new family favorite. I was so impressed with the simplicity of this recipe. The only surprise was how gooey the batter was and getting it all off of the beaters. This cake is super moist and a beautiful presentation!

Amazing cake! Always gets rave reviews when I serve it. Have had many ask for the recipe. Always make it exactly as written. May try the low-fat sour cream next time. I usually sprinkle with powdered sugar after it cools.

I needed a quick and easy cake for Thanksgiving and this recipe fit the bill perfectly! I do not have a bundt pan, so baked these in 2 - 9" round cake pans for 30 mins on 350 degrees then dropped the oven down to 325 for 10 more minutes until the middle was just underdone. I did cut the oil back to 3/4 cup as suggested. For a finishing touch, all I did was sprinkle powdered sugar on top and it was moist, delicious and fabulous. Everyone loved it! I used regular sized chocolate chips and they didn't melt all the way, but were perfectly scrumptious bits all throughout the cake. My husband says this is his new favorite and wants it for his birthday from now on.

Made cupcakes for daughter's bday.  Total hit!!  Everyone kept raving.  Used Satiny Chocolate Glaze for the cupcakes...to alleviate possible frosting issue, I dipped the tops of the cakes into the glaze.  Voila!!  Perfect!!

Like many reviewers, this is my go-to, no fail, always outstanding chocolate cake recipe!  I have now made this at least 6 times over the past year, and no matter when or where I serve it, it's a hit!  I have not tried tweeking it at all (which is not like me) because it's so good the way it is.  Enjoy!

Not sure that I'd make this again. Followed directions precisely, and while yes, it was easy, it still tasted like a boxed cake. It just wasn't impressive, and still had that fake spongey texture that comes with boxed cake.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and everyone loved it.  Extremely moist and delicious!  I followed the recipe as is w/o any changes.  My husband, who doesn't really like cake, loved it.  I prepared it with the buttercream icing on this site.  Thank for the delicious recipe!!!

Heavenly!  The day that it is baked, the chocolate chips are melted and provide warm pockets of chocolatey divinity; the next day, they've reconstituted a little so they become little bits of chocolate flakes that melt oh so wonderfully!  The third day....well, I would not know that, it was fully eaten less than 24 hours after it was fixed.  :)

For the glaze, I took 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips and a tbsp of light corn syrup and melted it over a double boiler.  I also added a bit of orange extract to the glaze to give the cake a little of a contrasting/accenting flavor to the chocolate.  Drizzled the glaze on top and let the pigging out begin!

Great cake although maybe it was TOO moist! Of course, it might have been my fault for not waiting the entire 1 plus hours to remove from the pan but either way it seemed a little soft. 
Excellent flavor, however.

This was very good and very easy, but I didn't detect a 'wow' factor! I would make it again, but it's not become my 'go to' for a chocolate cake. I did forget the chocolate chips which probably was the 'wow' factor. It was very easy and those not trying to critique it would probably be very satisfied with it.

Just was not that crazy about this cake (personal preference) - almost was too moist for me.  I used the Satin Glaze from this website and it was great.  I did get compliments on how nice it looked.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I used applesauce in place of the oil.  I think that needs to be cut in half.  I wish I would have maybe baked more than the 50 min. - maybe 60 min. and it might have not been so moist & dense.

This cake was good, but took longer than it should have to cook.  As a result, the edges were a bit more done than I would have liked.

Amazing cake!! Everyone loved it. Very moist. I used 1/2 c. veg oil and 1/2 c. apple sauce.  I did notice that the choc. chips don't melt so one time I left them chunky and the next time I pre-melted them and pored the melted chocolate into the already mixed batter. That turned out AWESOME! I covered it in the icing that's from this website (someone else mentioned the name of it but I forgot it) and then dusted it w/ powdered sugar right before serving. Sliced strawberries (or raspberries) around the outside decorate the plate nicely. Great recipe!!

I don't see what all the excitement is about ..... it was good but not awesome. It is very easy to make. I just sifted powdered sugar on top, but if I made this again (which I won't) I would add some type of glaze or frosting.

There are ways to lighten it up & it will still taste good.  You can use either 1/2 cup of oil and a 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce or 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  Instead of 4 eggs, you could use 1 cup of egg beaters.  As far as the sour cream, light or fat free is an option (I'd use light).  There is sugar free & fat free pudding as well.  Try the light way, if it doesn't taste great, go with the original recipe.  Happy baking :)

This is fantastic. I always lighten up baked goods, but since I was taking it to a party, I just went ahead and made this full out. I cannot eat chocolate so I ate a tiny bite and it was fantastic. Everyone at the party was raving about it. I would highly recommend this. WHen I make it for my husband's birthday this weekend, I will lighten it up but Wed when I make it for the teachers at school I will make it full on again!! Fantastic!!

This was exceptional.  I did not have chocolate pudding so I used a box of vanilla instead. I also used 1 square of unsweetened chocolate melted in the microwave since I didn't have chocolate pudding. Instead of the vegetable oil I used 1 cup of apple sauce and in place of the water I used 1/2 cup of coffee.  I did end up adding alittle more water since I used the applesauce instead of oil. Maybe an extra 1/4 -1/3cup of water.  I used no oil at all.  Instead of chocolate chips I put in some peanut butter chips I had left over.  IT was wonderful.  For frosting I used 4 squares BAKER'S Unsweetened Chocolate1 pkg. (16 oz.) powdered sugar1/2 cup butter or margarine-softened and 
2 tsp. vanilla and1/3 cup milk.  This was a keeper. Wonderful recipe. Very moist

Couldn't tell when it was done. The top was crusty after baking for 55 minutes, but the toothpick came out w/ batter all over it...or was it melted chocolate chips??? After cooling for the time specified, it collapsed in the pan before I even inverted it.

I have been making this recipe for quite a while now, it is definately my go to chocolate cake. The only real addition that I make is that I always substitute coffee for the water, it gives a nice rich flavor to the chocolate. Also, I sometimes use different kinds of chocolate, like grating German chocolate into the batter as well as the chocolate chips, or using dark chocolate and milk chocolate chips.

Good, but not great.  It ended up being a little bit dry which was probably the biggest negative.  I followed the recipe precisely, but per other comments I used mini chocolate chips instead of regular chocolate chips.  That was probably a good idea- the mini chocolate chips melted into the cake.  I dusted the top of the cake with powdered sugar.

OMG!!  This is HEAVEN ON EARTH!!!   This is not for the faint of heart!!  I did tweek it some to make it not so "heart stoping" by using FF Sour Cream, SF White Chocolate Pudding, Egg Whites for the whole eggs, and 1 cup of Applesauce for the huge cup of oil!  And I SWEAR there is no difference in taste!!  This thing was dripping with chocolate!!  We also used the Tripple Chocolate Fudge cake mix instead...Unbelievable!!  You will NOT be disappointed!

Love love love this recipe, the cake was moist and chocolatey without being too sweet. I skipped the chocolate chip and frosted the cake with chocolate frosting instead. Also, I used 2 sticks of softened butter instead of oil. The result was an incredibly chocolatey moist and flavorful chocolate cake. It tasted nothing like cake from a box!

We LOVED this recipe as is and so naturally I experimented with other flavors and different ingredient combinations.  I now use a basic revision of this recipe no matter what kind of cake I am making.  First I reduce the oil to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup softened butter. Second, I replace the water with milk.  Third, I add 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Lastly, I FOLD in the sour cream (and chips if I use them).  I think my favorite rendition of this recipe is a coconut cream cake with a lemon curd filling.  DELICIOUS!!  For that cake I replace the milk with coconut cream, use coconut pudding, and flaked coconut and lemon zest in place of cips.  Thank you so much for a great chocolate cake recipe that is so versatile and scrumptious!!!

This is a GREAT recipe. I have used it for many years. I decrease the amount of oil to 3/4 cup and I also used LIGHT (Daisy Brand) sour cream and add a splash of vanilla. I don't do this for the lower fat, but becuase it makes the cake a little bit fluffier, not quite so heavy. It still has that rich flavor though! 

I also make these into muffins from time to time. I fill the muffin cups about 3/4 of the way full and sprinkle with square choclate chunks. We can never eat them all, so if we are not sharing them, I slip about 9 of them per gallon size ziplock bag and freeze them. After that you can eat them one at a time by heating them for 10-20 seconds in the microwave.

The cake tastes just as great with 1/2 cup vegetable oil.  Also works out great with fat free sour cream.

This is NO QUESTION the best cake I have ever made. I took other people's advice and only used 1/2 cup of oil and because that made the batter a bit stiff for the electric beater I added a 1/2 cup of milk to make it a better batter consistency. I started checking to see if it was done after 35 minutes and checked every five minutes so it wouldn't overcook. In my oven it took 45 minutes. I inserted a chopstick into it and it came out clean. My husband raved ! You deserved that ribbon ! Thank you for sharing.

This was delightful.  I used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate (worked out very well).  I flipped the cake onto a cooling rack 20 minutes after baking (recipe suggests over an hour but not necessary)I drizzled the cake with chocolate and decorated with powered sugar and strawberries dipped in chocolate.

This is an awesome cake and everyone who tries it loves it. I've cut the oil down to 1/2 cup with the other 1/2 cup of fluid being water, and it's fine. (I have a copy of the 2001 Red Sox Wives' cookbook and this recipe is submitted by Jason Varitek as 'Death by Chocolate Cake').

This recipe is one of my favorite. Everyone loves it. I have had better luck using my aluminum pan rather than a dark pan that has  teflon coating because of the amount of chocolate. Turns out great every time in an aluminum pan. Great for bake sales because it's easy, quick, and everyone loves it.

I'm new to baking but I wanted to challenge myself so I dared myself to make this cake. It was pretty easy and quick. i read a lot of reviews, good and bad, to gather some tips and tricks. My advice: all ingredients need to be room temp, use a good quality baking pan (well greased and coated with flour), and use mini chocolate chips rather than the large. 
Will definitely be making this cake again!

Yes, it starts with a box mix. If you can get over your pride and just do it, you will NOT regret it. DELICIOUS! I have made this so many times, always to rave reviews. 5 stars as is, but I usually leave out the chocolate chips (I use a poured ganache that is so rich it really doesn't need them) and use strong coffee in place of the water. LOVE this cake.

Since this is my third time making this cake in less than 2 months, I figured I owed it to the rest of you to write a review. This cake is utterly fantastic and so easy for when you just don't have time to make a whole cake from scratch. I have a husband and 4 boys who could not get enough! The first time I made it, it was for a potluck. My family was so disappointed that everyone else got to eat it, that I had to make another one just for them the following weekend. I used mini chocolate chips, as other reviewers recommended. I put about 3/4's of the bag in the batter. I generously coated the bottom of the bundt pan with butter, and have never had a problem with the cake sticking. After the cake was cooled, I drizzled it with the Chocolate Ganache recipe from this site, then sprinkled some of the leftover mini chocolate chips on top. Perfection!

I found this recipe in December 2012.  I've made it probably 10 times since.  Everyone loves it.  My sister likes it best with no glaze or frosting on it.  I made it this past holiday season for our department Christmas party.  I took canned dark chocolate frosting and heated some in the microwave to thin it down to a glaze consistency.  Then drizzled on the cake and then sprinkled with mini-chocolate chips.  It was a hit!  Every recipe I've tried with allrecipes.com have been great!  Thank you!

When I read the ingredients I thought this was going to taste like a box cake, but all the reviews made me try it. I am so glad I did. This cake took 5 minutes to prepare and turned out amazing. I can't say enough about it. It was moist flavorful, and tasted like homemade. I only used 3/4 cup of the oil but cep erythema else was the same. I served it with salted caramel sauce and good ole vanilla ice cream. Delicious. Definately my go to chocolate cake recipe from now on!

I love this recipe and have made it a few different ways I have followed the recipe exactly and over time made a few modifications. I don’t use water in recipes it has no flavor so I substituted the water with fresh brewed coffee, I also don’t like oil so I replaced the oil with melted butter I also added ½ the Sour cream and added ½ cup of cream cheese. I grease my pan with shortening and dust with flour. I love this cake it always comes out moist (I usually have to cook a bit longer then the recipes calls for).

As most reviews, my office loves this cake.  It was dubbed chocolate deliciousness.  Today I decided to make cupcakes or double chocolate muffins out of them and they came out great, and the chocolate chips didn't fall to the bottom due to the shortened baking time of 22 minutes on 350 degrees for 30 cupcakes.  Fill the muffin pan as these don't rise as high as a traditional cake.  For the bundt version, I put half the batter in the pan without chocolate chips and then I add the two cups to the second half of the batter which seems to evenly distribute the chips due to settling when baking.  Finally I put half a cup of applesauce and a half a cup of oil and it still tastes great!  Pair it up with half the batter of Love This Chocolate Glaze (food.com) and you can't go wrong.

Spectacular!  This impressed a very picky eater.  Also, my dad can't have chocolate due to a medication he takes.  I made a new version for him with yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, and white chips.  All other ingredients remained the same and it turned out wonderfully!

Is good, but is not five star in my book. I would cook it again if I wanted something easy with lots of chocolate but it is not something too cook for a special occasion or for guests.

Incredible... Rich, moist cake that definitely does not require frosting. You will definitely need a glass of milk with this one. I went ahead and drizzled it with a fudge-style frosting, and it was over the top.

The mother of all chocolate cakes! Used 3/4 c. Oil and 1/4 c. Kahlua. Also added 1 T. Espresso powder. Otherwise followed recipe. Took one reviewer's advice and glazed with 1 c. Heavy cream heated with 1c. Chocolate chips til smooth. Cool and drizzle away. I call this "Death by Chocolate Cake."

I couldn't find an 18.25oz box of devils food cake mix and used the 15.25oz box.  I even accidentally dumped in 1 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup.  Despite those two mistakes,  the cake turned out amazing.  I'm a guy and don't bake and even I was able to make a crowd pleasing cake.

Best chocolate bundt cake I have ever made. Very moist, couldn't stop eating it. I used 1/2 cup warm strong coffee instead of water. This is a keeper.

I make this cake all the time for birthdays or special occasions. It is my go to recipe for chocolate cake. It never fails me and it never gets old hearing, "Man, this is good chocolate cake!" after people take their first couple bites. I usually top it with coconut pecan frosting, the kind used for german chocolate cake. At first I made it exactly as the recipe says. Now I make it with 1 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and only use 1 cup of chocolate chips like others suggested. Reduces the calories substantially. 1 cup of oil is 1984 calories and 224 grams of fat. 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce is 100 calories and 0 grams of fat. That means I've eliminated 1884 calories and 224 grams of fat from the entire cake and I swear, I cannot taste the difference between the two. My father and brother did not notice the difference either when I fed them the applesauce version for the first time on their birthdays.

I love this cake and so does my family.  It is very easy and so moist.  I have made it at least 30 times and am making it again tonight.   It is NOT too much, just right.  However a scoop of vanilla ice cream really adds to it.  Don't change it.... it is great just as it is.

I love this recipe. This was so moist! The only change I made was that I used half the oil and half apple sauce in place of the cup of oil. I've made this cake 3 times!everyone loves it with just powdered sugar and some whipped cream on each slice.  Jean

I've made this cake several times and LOVE IT. It's so easy because you can mix everything in one bowl. I use the mini chocolate chips in it. I don't put any icing on it because it doesn't need it. It's even better the next day. I have one in the over right now to take to the church for a lunch they are serving.

AWESOME!! Followed the recipe although I used a cake mix that was smaller than listed. Duncan Hines was the one I used. For me its difficult to tell when its done, the time listed did not create a clean toothpick.

SO good!  I made the recipe as stated except I had to bake it at 325 because I had a dark, non-stick Bundt pan.  I baked it for 55 minutes and it came out perfect.  I was a little nervous with the cup of oil but since this was a special occasion I decided to go for it.  I'm happy I made this the day before the event because I really feel that the oil had a chance to soak into the cake and it tasted less greasy (had to try a little taste...hehehe).  I topped it with the recommended Satiny Chocolate Cake.  It was a huge hit...moist and decadent.  Cannot wait to make this again.  Thank you for sharing!

If you're a huge chocolate fan and you have a major sweet tooth, then this is the ultimate cake for you. I used fat free sour cream, egg beaters, 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil.

This recipe is excellent! I used it for devil's food cupcakes and they baked perfectly. I followed other reviews and used only 1/2 cup oil and baked them for 15 min. at 350 and turned it down to 325 for an additional 10 min. They were perfect! Thanks for a great recipe :)

Awesome cake! I used egg whites instead of whole eggs, fat free pudding instead of reg., fat free sour cream instead of reg., and used unsweeted applesauce instead of oil and cut out a lot of calories and it was still the bomb! You couldn't tell at all! 5 stars!!!

This was a VERY good chocolate cake, but I have to say it wasn't the best chocolate cake I've ever had. I guess after reading all of the reviews, I was expecting a melt in your mouth, overly chocolate cake- but it really wasn't. I followed the recipe exactly (with mini chips) and used someone's suggestion of a cream cheese glaze. I thought that using a chocolate frosting or glaze would've made it too sweet  or too "chocolatey"- but I think that would've actually made it better. Everyone at work thought it was very good too....but sadly, I will still be looking for the ultimate chocolate cake to bake!

I have made this cake several times, already.  It is so moist, high, and a chocolate lover's dream come true.  I made it once with 1 cup of oil, then made it with half oil and half apple sauce. I think I like the second version better. It's just as light, but less oily.  To make sure the chocolate morsels did not sink to the bottom, I gave them a slight chop in the food processor, so I had slivers and half pieces.  Perfect!  Package weights are changing.
Be sure to check the weight of the pudding mix on the box.

Good flavor but way too much oil! I made it exactly as directed even though I did read reviews calling for less oil, I wanted to see for myself. I will try at a later date with much less oil...

I don't know what the hype is over this cake.  It is just lacking in taste to me.  Okay- I grew up with everything homemade and still make most things from scratch.  I used full fat sour cream, 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup milk- I had regular bitter sweet chips so chopped them small and used 1/2 cup of coffee in place of water and added vanilla, as another cook suggested.  I baked it at 350 for 30 min, then 335 for 25 min and it was perfectly done. My family thinks its good- I think it is so-so.  If you want an unbeatable chocolate cake, try the one on the back of the Hershy's Cocoa can- Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake.  It's from scratch, easy and the moistest cake you'll ever eat - and people have gone nuts over this for years.  It will remain my staple.

Ok, first of all, I thought the recipe was easy and after reading the reviews, I couldn't wait to try it....so far, it's been in the oven for 1 1/2.  Originally baked for 55 mins, as recommended and like others, the batter around the bundt ring isn't baked thoroughly.  Guess I go to bakery in the morning for a birthday cake for my Mom..

I have made this over a dozen times now and everyone loves it. The cake is great for decorating, very solid but still moist.  I have used mini chocolate chips every time except for once and it was a big mistake. Definitely go with the the mini chips...they melt right into the cake.

Absolutely wonderful.  Used previous recommendations for mini choc chips since I had some on hand and everone loved them.  I made cupcakes 350 20 min and mini cupcakes 350 11 min and both were moist and delicious.  They rose perfectly since my appearance of the cake is very important.  Tasted great without frosting but I had my favorate on hand Creamy Chocolate Frosting and it was amazing.

Serioulsly the most chocolate-y, moist, and delicious cake! I used mini chocolate chips and only used 1/2c of oil and upped the water to a full 1c. and it was perfect.  Just dusted with powdered sugar...nothing more needed.

This cake is down right rich & evil! I finished it off with a chocolate ganache, and chopped pecans. I used the mini bittersweet chips. Next time I will use the dark chips. This has to be served in thin slices cause even a real choco-addict finds it very rich.

Seriously - I made it, and then I made it again, and then I made it again. I have never bought so many cake mixes in my life (being a from-scratch girl). 
I only changed the oil to apple sauce for fats sake - and next time I am going to sub plain yoghurt for sour cream!!!!

This is hands down the best cake recipe I have ever tried! Granted, it's got the semi-homemade thing going on, but that's all the better in my eyes. 
I took someone else's advice and made cupcakes at 350 for 20 minutes, and they came out DIVINE. Just moist as could be. Going in the recipe box!

My son requested the world's chocolatiest cake for his 6th birthday so I went with this one.  I used a little less oil and added a generous splash of coffee.  Everyone LOVED it, and the kids were raving about the chocolate chips in it.  My son said it was the best cake EVER and coming from him, the chocolate fanatic, that really means something!

This is one of the best chocolate cake recipes I've ever had.  I throw it in cake pans, and it only takes about 35 minutes at 350.  It's so easy to do, although everyone always wants to recipe and I am hesitant to tell them it's mostly from a box.  Also, I ice the whole thing with chocolate frosting for even more chocolate

Great flavor, but even us chocoholics couldn't eat much because it was just too much chocolate. Never thought I'd say that!

This is wonderful...and fool proof!  I wasn't paying attention and added regular pudding instead of the instant and it didn't seem to make a difference.  I did take another reviewers advice and added the tiny chocolate morsels so they wouldn't sink to the bottom while baking.  It was delicious.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  I try different cake mixes and pudding mixes too...  White with coconut pudding, shaved coconut and coconut milk instead of water was great.  Right now I have white with vanilla pudding and fresh blueberries baking in the oven.  This cake does not need any frosting... you can't go wrong making this for your family!

Very moist, rich, CHOCOLATELY cake! The cake mix was easy to put together. In place of the 1/2 cup of warm water, I used 1/2 cup of strong brewed coffee. I followed the rest of the directions to a "T". I also dusted the chocolate chips with a little flour so it would not sink straight down to the bottom of the cake. I made sure the bundt pan was greased well. The cake rose up nicely. Once the caked cooled, I was able to flip it upside down onto to a plate and it came out with no problem. Instead of dusting the cake with powdered sugar, I topped the cake off with a drizzle of "Chocolate Glaze I," from this website. The glaze gave the cake a very nice presentation. The cake was a huge hit with the chocolate lovers in this family- they gobbled this up.

Very good cake!  Nice and moist and held together well.  I will try it again and replace all or some of the oil with applesauce: 600 calories are too many to overlook. However, the cake is very easy and very yummy!  A hit in our house!

This cake is awesome! I especially enjoyed it chilled with a dollop of whipped cream. 
I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and increased the water slightly and may even cut the oil down to 2/3 cup next time, but other than that i followed the recipe exactly and everybody gobbled it up!

This is a really great chocolate cake and sooo easy to make. The small chips great idea! Different flavor chips also are great to mix it up.  You can also decorate the top with any type of seasonal colors after it cools. Everyone that tastes it loves it, even if they are not a big chocolate lover. thx!

I just think ghiradelli brownies out of the box are better than this cake.  It was very good but in my opinion not worth the extra work (it is not a lot of work but you can have better tasting dessert that is even less work!).  I think I might experiment with coconut or peanut butter because it is an interesting start.  thanks!  I am giving 5 stars only for the opportunity to make it with different combinations!

My family had mixed reviews on this one.  My father, who loves chocolate cake, didn't care for it at all.  He kept saying he was tasting "something" in it he didn't like, but he couldn't really describe what it was.  I'm wondering if he was tasting the "chemical" taste other reviewers have mentioned.  My mother and I enjoyed the cake, especially the fact that it doesn't need any frosting at all with the chocolate chips in it, but I was a little turned off by the texture.  Like one of the lower star-rating reviewers said, it was almost rubbery.  My daughter and fiance thought it was just okay, but they prefer other cakes I've made.  I think I'll stick with our previous favorites and keep looking for a really good chocolate bundt cake recipe.

Definitely lives up to it's name. After my daughter's first bite she said there's too much chocolate Mommy! My husband who seldom has a sweet tooth enjoyed it as well. Be sure to have a glass of milk handy! Though it was good, I wasn't overly impressed with it.

Delicious!  Made a few changes because I like to experiment with recipes.  
I used a bundt pan, sprayed well with Pam.  Instead of 1 cup of oil, I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup buttermilk.  Also, I cut water down to 1/3 cup.  I used 1 1/2 cups mini chips instead of 2 cups.  
When you test with a toothpick, you might think it is not done if you run the toothpick into the chips.  I cooked it for 50 minutes on 350 and it was done.  Just touch the top and if it is spongy, it is done.  
***Make sure to cool it completely for at least an hour or two before you invert it onto a platter!!!  
For a nice drizzle on top, I used a double boiler and mixed a handful of choc chips with a dash of half and half and a tsp butter.  When melted, I drizzled on the cake.  I then did the same thing with white choc chips.  Then I sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  Filled the center with fresh wine berries (wild raspberries) I had just picked and voila!  The perfect ending to a long day!
***Note...don't know how it could taste better, but it is better the next day!  This is a very rich cake, almost brownie consistency!  Also, goes great with vanilla ice cream!!!***

Oh my gosh this is the best chocolate cake I've ever had! The chocolate chips add that gooey chocolate to every bite. The only thing I did different was to use 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and use fat-free sour cream. I garnished with powdered sugar and fresh raspberries

This cake is sinfully delicious.  The only change I made was using mini chocolate chips as other reviewers suggested.  It's a cross between a rich brownie and those molten chocolate cakes.  I think next time I'll bake it in a cake pan or individual ramekins instead of the bundt pan.

I love this bundt cake - so moist and decadent, try adding 1/3 cup kaluah to the mix?  Might add another 1/2  cup sour cream also?   Never a nibble left after an office party or picnic.

Love! I've made this several times and everyone goes crazy for it! I have never deviated from the original recipe because for me it's perfect as is. I do pair with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and the combination is just beyond :) Thanks so much!

I made this cake for easter and my whole family loved it! It stays moist and was a crowd pleaser for a chocolate dessert pleaser! I couldn't find any vegetable oil so i used applesauce and you couldn't eve tell the difference! One Tip: make sure you buy enough chocolate chips, about 2 bags of Ghiradelli mini's worked great for me!

This was a good tasting cake.  However, I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it was like the sides burnt before the middle of the cake was done.  Not sure if I need to turn down the oven next time or do it in a bundt pan as it says to.  I will try it again.

This recipe has become a family favorite!  My children love it, and I am frequently asked to make it for birthdays and family gatherings.  I think the recipe is perfect as is - no alterations needed.  I have also done it with vanilla cake, white chocolate chips, and a homemade raspberry sauce.  But the chocolate rendition is by far the favorite.  Works well for cupcakes too.

I used this recipe as is for the chocolate base of my s'mores cupcakes. They turned out amazing! Gooey and moist on the inside. They were so good I had to join the site and leave a review after years of use! Made 24 larger cupcakes.

I thought this was perfect. It was super easy and delicious even without a glaze. I used mini chocolate chips to avoid big chunks, and it worked out wonderfully. For those who complain it's too sweet or chocolatey, I don't know what else you expected from a cake with this title. I don't think it tasted like chemicals at all. I grew up on boxed cake mix and more often than not, I like it more than what I get in a bakery. It was everything I imagined it would be. I'll have dreams about this cake.

Have made this twice now...they first time baked it with the mini chips and didn't leave it in long enough but was still wonderful.  Yesterday morning I made it again with regular size chocolate chips and left it in longer and it was fabulous.  My neighbors had a party and I brought it over.  My cake was GONE!  There were three there and the others were not 1/2 gone!  Thank you...this is wonderful!

This cake is sooo good! Very moist. To keep the calories down I used 1% sour cream and substituted 1/2 cup of apple sauce for 1/2 cup of the oil. I will definitely be making this again.

Mmmmm, so good!!  I am a chocolate lover, so of course I loved this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious, but it so super chocolatey that a very small piece can satisfy my sweet tooth.  I have made it two times: first,  the all chocolate way with a chocolate glaze, then again with mint chips and a mint glaze - both ways got rave reviews and requests for more in the future.  This is so easy, simple, moist, and yummy.  I think this might be the only way I will make cakes from now on!

I made this cake for Mother's Day, it was absolutely delicious!  As per other's advice, I cut down the oil to 3/4 cup and I used mini chocolate chips as well.  I'll be making this again!

I used another reviewer's suggestions and subsituted fat free sour cream, sugar free pudding mix, and applesauce instead of oil. SOOO GOOD!!! I couldn't find the right size box of pudding mix, so I used 3 2.1 oz boxes, and it seemed to work just fine. The batter is SUPER thick, which worried me at first. I used the Chocolate Ganache recipe by INGRIDEVOGEL from this site. Perfect! I can't wait to make this again!

I have made this cake several times, and it is my co-workers favorite. I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and added mini chocolate chips. I also made these in a cupcake format and they were devoured!

this is good, very moist. I only used 1 cup choc. chips cause that's all I had and it was definitely chocolaty enough. I didn't give 5 stars cause while it was good, it wasn't anything amazing i would have to make again or rush to give out the recipe to friends or family. Maybe I'm just not a big bundt cake fan. I have yet to make one that I "love".

Made exactly as written only used the smaller box of pudding by mistake and mini chocolate chips. Drizzled hot fudge over it when serving. Served with vanilla ice cream.

Just a note....if anyone is wondering, this recipe turns out great as cupcakes. I just made two batches and I baked them at 350 for about 22 minutes. I plan on frosting them with chocolate frosting too!! P.S. I used the suggestion of many previous users and cut the oil to 1/2 cup, used 1/3 cup milk in place of the water, and used 1 1/2 cups of miniature chocolate chips. YUM!

I changed the Devil's Food for Dark Chocolate cake, and turned out very good. This is a good recipe if you like a gooey consistency. The cup of oil wasn't a problem at all, but I think I left it to much in the oven 'cause every time it "finished" baking, the tooth pick never came out clean (I guess it was because of the melted chocolate chips in the center). The Satiny Chocolate Glaze gives a pleasant bitter-sweet touch to the sweetness of the cake. I am definitely gonna try it again, it's like chocolate fudge brownies turned into cake.

Okay, this recipe was INCREDIBLE! Seriously, there are no words. I used the mini chocolate chips which after it was baked made it just like punches of pure chocolate. I dont usually like chocolate cake but I seriously couldnt get enough of this. I guess the only bad thing I can say is you wont be able to stop eating it. I'll be using this again for sure. Thanks!!

Why would a cake that tastes like a boxed cake win an award?  I tasted like chemicals with chocolate chips, even though I got the expensive boxed cake and Baker's chips.

I've made this cake 2 times now.  Both times I used half the oil which was just by my choice.  The batter is VERY thick, but resist the urge to add liquid.  It will rise just fine.  I also used mini chips.  I'm looking foward to trying different cake/pudding/chip combos.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an amazing cake! I took others suggestions and used mini chocolate chips.  A definite must! I have found I usually need more than 55 minutes to cook this as a budnt. If you are in a time crunch they make great cupcakes. They usually cook in 15-17 minutes.

I have made a sugar free version for my mom-in-law by omitting the chocolate chips and using a sugar free instant pudding and cake mix.  I cannot believe how wonderful it turned out sugar free! Definitely didn't miss anything.

Didn't have chocolate pudding but used coconut instead.  Taste was great.  I even gave a piece to a friend who owns a bakery in town and she went wild.  When I told her I had used a mix she didn't believe me.  Thank YOU Denise!!!

So moist and delicious! I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup applesauce. I used fat free sour cream, dark chocolate cake mix, devil's food pudding mix, and mini chocolate chip. Baked as cupcakes @ 350 for 17 minutes. Made 30 cupcakes.

This was an utter flop for me. I followed the directions as written, didn't know if I was supposed to flour the pan so I did so lightly. This was sickeningly oily, made a mess of my oven, and did not taste good. I trusted the reviews and took it (without trying it first) to a Christmas party where I'm usually asked to bring dessert. In general, I make decadent desserts from scratch, so I put a lot on the line by cheating with a box and bringing this to the table. It was politely nibbled. Too bad, I had high hopes.

Excellent and easy!  I didn't bother with a glaze or powdered surgar and everyone devoured it.  I'm not a huge baker, so this recipe was perfect for me.  I can see how versatile you could be, depending on flavour of cake mix/pudding you use.

This cake, although super moist, was so rich it upset my stomach.  I should never have put a glaze on it as it just added to the sickly sweetness.  If I ever tackle this again, I will reduce the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup and just dust the top with confectioners' sugar & serve with a small scoop of ice cream.  I would also recommend to use 'no fat' ingredients where ever possible.

This is definitely a CHOCOLATE cake, wow!  I didn't put the glaze on this, or even bother with the dusting of powdered sugar, the cake is rich enough on it's own.    The only suggestion I have, for those who have problems with the chocolate chips sinking. If you very lightly dust the chocolate chips with flour before you add them to the batter, they will somehow stay suspended throughout the baking process.

This is a hit!  The only thing I do different is in a double boiler I melt some butter, milk and chocolate chips and pour directly on cake as icing.

I made this for my chocolate loving husband.  Instead of a bundt pan I did two 9 inch layers.  After reading reviews, I only used 3/4 cup of oil and 3 eggs.  It was absolutely too much chocolate cake and he loved it.  As did I.

I'm actually glad i used applesauce instead of oil because the cake was so moist. After 30 minutes, mg toothpick was still coming out unclean! I also poked holes in the top of the hot cake and poured a raspberry sauce (just raspberries cooked on the stove with a little bit of sugar, then strained to get the seeds out) over it. A big hit. Very rich, yummy, but i think a bit too moist.

I'd really give it 10/10! I've made this recipe during several occasions for summer parties and birthdays and everyone has absolutely loved it! I only use egg whites and put them in a separate bowl and beat them until they are firm and foamy, to add into the mix. This makes the cake even fluffier and melts in your mouth. I also melt the chocolate chips I have left over in the microwave and drizzle it on top of the cake with some strawberries to give it some extra color. Friends have raved about this cake. I will definitely keep using this recipe!

Delicious!  I substituted butter (2 1/2 sticks, melted) for the vegetable oil and reduced the time to 38 mins for two 9-inch round metal pans, and it came out perfectly.  It received rave reviews from my co-workers; I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

This cake was amazingly delicious!!!  It was really late last night and i decided i wanted some cake after my dinner, but i didn't want to take the time needed to make a scratch cake. So i had a dark chocolate cake mix (which we don't usually have cake mixes) and i found this recipe. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, which i always do, 1/2 cup of oil and 1/3 cup of milk and only about 1 1/4 cups of choco chips. Also, my pudding mix wasn't instant, it was some weird one that your supposed to make with tofu but it worked and i used dark chocolate cake mix. And wow!! did it turn out!!  Out of all the chocolate cakes i have made, and I have been searching for a good from scratch one for a while, this has blown them away!!! I've given some to friends and friends parents and guess what? They have all loved it too! I am exited for this recipe, thank you Denise!

I know this recipe is highly rated but with using box mixes I was not expecting much from it, but oh my goodness it is delicious.  The cake just seems to melt in your mouth with a slightly crunchy edge.  I topped with melted white chocolate and served with cream.  Looking forward to trying different cake combinations with this recipe.  Thank you for sharing...

hi naxalite! the boxed cake mixes we have here in the US are generally right around 18.25 oz. in size, which is about 517g, so that's no typo. as for the pudding, the instant kind you are referring to (with which milk is added) is the same the recipe is calling for. the size in the recipe for could very well be a typo because most bundt cake recipes i've seen using instant pudding call for the smaller size we have over here, which is 3.9 oz. or roughly 4 half-cup servings. i've made a similar recipe using the smaller box of pudding ('chocolate cavity maker cake' on this site) and it turns out wonderfully.  i thought this recipe was a bit off as well, because it doesn't seem like there should be an entire cup of oil in it, but who knows...maybe that's what makes it so good ! fat satisfys, right? hope this helps. happy baking!

SUPER cake recipe! Here are the things that I did different: I used a 3.9oz pkg of instant pudding as that is all I had; I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract and I subbed the water out for Kahlua! I heated the slices up and served them with vanilla ice cream and fudge sauce- YUUUMMMMYYYY!! Once it was all heated up and served that way, it tasted a lot like the Molten Chocolate Cake that Chilis serves. I'm thinking of adding peppermint extract and peppermint schnapps for a holiday version-we'll see how that turns out!

I make this cake all the time for parties and holidays.  It is absolutely awesome!  I suggest using mini chocolate chips.  Also, I always seem to have to bake this longer than the recipe calls for - usually an extra 15-20 minutes.

I am a great cook but a terrible baker... I haven't found a cake recipe I couldn't mess up, until now! I swear this one is the most adaptable, forgiving cake recipe ever! I made it as written but forgot the chocolate chips, and it turned out perfectly. Then I made a lower fat version with 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce, 1/2 c egg substitute and only 2 eggs, and lower fat sour cream. It turned out virtually the same (my husband couldn't tell the difference at all), yum yum yum. Both times I made it in a bundt pan at 335 for 55 minutes at high altitude, and it cooked perfectly.

I literally threw this cake together in 5 minutes as I was getting dinner together.  Luckily, I had all the ingredients on hand.  I used a box of instant chocolate pudding with caramel chips, which was slightly smaller than the recipe's 5.7 oz box recommendation, but there seemed to be no lack of moistness, texture or taste.  Really an easy, foolproof recipe!  Thanks!

Good grief this is a great cake.  When it comes to B-day cakes I always make a pound cake, which is now a big joke in my family.  So, I made this cake for my husband's B-day the other day and he couldn't stop eating it!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  As for the chocolate chips, I used Hershey's special dark choc. chips.  Before I added them to the batter I tossed them with about a TBSP of flour to keep them from all falling to the bottom of the cake during baking.  I say this trick on the Food network and it works every time.

After reading the great reviews on this cake, I was truly excited about making it. However, I was very disappointed with the final result. I followed the recipe exactly, but for whatever reason, the cake was not cooked all the way through after 55 minutes and fell after letting it cool for the hour and a half. The outside was a little hard for my liking and the inside was way too gooey. I don't know if I will try this one again or not.

I have been making this recipe for years now- and every time I make it, people have seconds!  They also ask for the recipe because they can't believe how good it is!  I use mini choc. chips and they're perfect.   You can also make this with lemon cake & lemon pudding (I add 2 tbl. of lemon juice and the rhind for additional freshness), vanilla cake & vanilla pudding.  All have great results!

I would give this more stars if I could.  I made this for a co-workers birthday and made a double layer round cake.  I used a peanut butter frosting made of canned white frosting with pb mixed with it, then frosted with a chocolate frosting made swirls of the pb frosting topped those with pb cups cut in half.  They thought I bought it until they tasted it and said you can't buy cake this good.  This is THE cake I will make for any occasion I have to bring a cake to, also because I can change the flavor as easy as using different cake mixes and chips.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I reduced the oil to two-thirds or so.  I agree with the mini-chip idea, they do stay suspended better.  I made these in cupcake form and they came out wonderfully chocolatey and moist, no problem.  I made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze as suggested by a few reviewers and dipped each cupcake in it to coat the top.  Then I sliced up strawberries and topped each one with a whole sliced strawberry or a few blueberries or raspberries.  The glaze stiffened up nicely but didn't harden so they were still easy to eat but the berries held fast.  Beautiful and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow the recipe is soooooo good!!!! I cant wait to make this for my chocoholic mother in law. I will try mini chocolate chips next time.I used a chocolate fudge pudding. Some people complained of the cake being overcooked on the outside so I loosely covered with foil while baking and dropped the temp to 325 after the first 30 minutes. After cooling in the pan for an hour I put it in a glass cake dome and covered letting it get steamy in hopes to make it extra moist. I topped with Marshmallow ice cream topping from this site and a sprinkling of graham crackers to make a S'mores cake. Needless to say my kids were singing "mom is great, she gave me chocolate cake" and scarfing it down.

Hands down the best chocolate cake ever.  I am a little confused about the amount of pudding though.  The 5.9 oz. the recipe calls for is not a normal box size.  I used the normal 3.9 oz. box and it came out great.  Best I've ever had!

This cake smelled DELICIOUS...unfortunately I wasn't able to try it. I tripped getting it out of the oven and it splatted right on the floor. Oh well, I'll try again later..

Well, I'm sorry what I'm about to say, but here it goes: I agree with most of the reviewers - it's very moist and EXTREMELY sweet cake. However despite sour cream, oil etc. it just a box cake and tastes like one. Very boring, expected flavor.

Quite good and obviously easy to make.  Very fluffy.  I would omit the chocolate chips next time though, I just felt like they added nothing, maybe its just a diminishing returns type thing.  Baked in 2 9-in pans for 40 minutes.  Looking forward to using other peoples variations of different cake box flavors/pudding flavor combos.

So moist, so chocolaty, so decadent! I did only use 1/2 oil and I added 1/3 cup milk, but didn't change a thing other than that. I'll definitely be making this cake for years to come. It's so easy, and so amazingly delicious.

What can I say that hasnt already been said?  What a great recipe!!  I'm not a big chocolate cake person, but this one has me nibbling slices (and if properly eaten over the sink, the calories dont count!)

I made this for my daughter's 17th birthday because she wanted "the chocolateiest cake ever!" I would have to agree - I iced the cake with a not-so-sweet ganache and it was absolutely fantastic. Super moist and flavorful, simple and easy! Kudos! This recipe rocks!

Unbeliveable, delicious! Don't be fooled by the fact that this recipe uses a mix...it tastes nothing like a mix. I made the cake as-is, and drizzled with a chocolate-raspberry glaze as follows:  Stir 1/4C heavy cream and 1/4C seedless raspberry jam in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until jam melts; bring to boil. Remove from heat. Add 6oz semi-sweet chocolate and stir until melted.

OMG OMG OMG!!!!!! I like to think of myself as a cake snob and I really wasn't too sure about the whole cake mix thing because I have tried many of the cake mix doctor recipes and they are ok, but not fabulous.  Well, this has changed my mind!  It is SOOO rich and SOOO good! I truly think it is the best chocolate cake I have ever made and I haven't even put a glaze on it yet.  I had to bake mine about 10 minutes longer and it was just right- not dry in the least.  I used butter flavored pam for the cake pan and also I think using the mini chocolate chips helped.  I don't like biting into something crunchy in a cake and the mini chips just made like little soft melted choc. spots in cake!!!!  YuM!!!!!

This is possibly the best chocolate cake I've ever made or eaten.  Wow!  It is so easy to make and so incredibly moist!  I made it for a group of 120 high school students and they (and their teachers) couldn't stop talking about it.  Instead of using a bundt pan I made it in a 9x13 and used the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze from this site.  I will be making this cake over and over again!

Great cake. I subtituted applesauce for oil and it got rave reviews. I omitted the chocolate chips for calorie sake and people still wanted the recipe.

This is probably one of the BEST chocolate cakes I've ever eaten and I am not exaggerating.  I used the healthier recipe suggested by another reviewer, replacing oil with unsweetened applesauce, using nonfat sour cream, fat free pudding mix, and egg whites instead of eggs.  It is delicious and dense and slices beautifully.  I made two 8 x 2" layers, baked at 350 for about 25 minutes.  I filled this with strawberry jam and it was divine!!

My younger sister and I made this together, and it's fabulous!  I had no idea that such an amazing chocolate cake could come from store-bought cake mix... I don't think I'll ever prepare it according to directions on the back of the box again!  Thanks for this recipe.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's mother's anniversary/birthday.  It was an absolute hit :)  I changed it around a bit to make it more my "own".  I used 3/4 of a cup of sour cream and added 1/4 cup of sugar free raspberry syrup (the Torani syrups) and used raspberry/dark chocolate swirl chips.  I baked it in two round 8" cake pans and put a layer of raspberry jam in between the two cake layers.  I then covered it in a glaze made with 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 2 egg whites, a splash of lemon juice and about a tablespoon of raspberry syrup.  This made more than enough glaze to cover the cake. It was absolutely delicious!  I'm getting ready to make a cake following this recipe but with french vanilla cake mix, french vanilla pudding, cinnamon chips, and a cinnamon glaze.

Great for that chocolate fix we all need from time to time.!  I melted a can of double chocolate frosting (Betty Crocker) and spooned it on the cake when serving....it was delicious.  I didn't use any oil...instead used a half cup of mayonaise and added more water.  The cake was ready in 40 minutes.

This was very tasty and moist. I used Pilsbury's new 50% less sugar chocolate cake mix, used fat free sour cream  and I replaced half the oil with applesauce.(Every little bit helps) My guests were happy to take the leftovers so I wouldn't be tempted!  It was too yummy!

I have made this cake many many times now. It is not the fanciest cake in the world, but for the ease of making and the simple taste, it is incredible.  It travels extremely well, is (in our opinion) better without frosting, and stays moist for several days if wrapped.  Try simply dusting with powdered sugar or topping with a little whipped cream.  I like to use good chocolate chips, like Ghirardelli double-chocolate/60% cocoa. Make sure you don't overbake it or it will go dry.  If your knife comes out still sticky, test several places in case you hit a chocolate chip. Always get requests for this recipe!

Oh My Goodness! What a rich cake! A warning to all. DO NOT make this unless you have a gallon of ice cold milk on hand. The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup of strongly brewed coffee rather than the warm water. I also drizzled a chocolate glaze over it. A beautiful presentation.
Addition to 5/8/05 review...
This cake is even better the next day.
WOW!!!!!!!!!
Addition 5/11/05..
I finally had to take the rest of this to work. We just couldn't eat anymore of it. My co-workers loved it. Good thing I printed copies of the recipe in advance. Made a couple points with the president of the company too.

Since all the cake mixes in the store were 15.25oz, I did the math and cut all ingredients down 25% to be appropriate and brought down the temp to 325 for 55 minutes. Therefore I only used 3 eggs, 3/4 c sour cream, 3/4c oil, 1/3 c of water and 1.5 c mini chocolate chips. Topped with a can of store bought chocolate frosting after I warmed it up in the microwave and sprinkled the rest of the mini choc chips. It was an absolutely lovely cake.

Everyone loved it at the Xmas dinner and now that new cake mixes don't come in18 oz boxes, I had to adjust water to 1/3 cup and oil to 2/3 cup. Also, I added coffee to water so that cake becomes more rich.

I made it for one event and got great reviews.  Made it again a few days later and used different brand names for ingredients - same great reviews from the people who ate it.  Several days later, my husband asked me to make it again for his birthday.  Everytime I made it, results were consistent.  This is my new 'go-to' dessert to bring to functions.

I'm very pleased with this recipe. I'm not usually into really rich desserts but this was exceptionally good. The rich chocolate flavor and texture were perfect. I made it for a family birthday party where it was a huge hit. I made it exactly as written other than I adjusted the wet ingredients since my cake mix was only 15.25 oz. I omitted one egg yolk, and just roughly decreased the oil, sour cream, and water by 1/6th. I used light sour cream. I'm sure it would work well with fat free sour cream as well. I also used mini semi-sweet chips. For ease of transport I baked this in a glass 9 x 13 oblong pan, 350 degrees for 40 minutes. I topped it with Allrecipes' 'Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze' and added chopped walnuts. I look forward to making this often in the future.

This was delicious and not too sweet for those that don't care for that.  Frankly, I was a little disappointed when there was no chocolate icing recipe along with this since the photo shows some on top.  Nevertheless, very, very good!

This cake was a 100% winner this Christmas. People said it was the Best Red Velvet they had ever eaten. I did use white chocolate mini chips and sour cream icing. Rich, moist and perfect.

Delis and really easy!  For above 8000' I increased temp 15°and cooked in bundt pan for 48 minutes - perfect ??but stuck on top with Pam used as release agent. 
Cooked a strawberry variation but the cake mix was only 15.25 and already had pudding in mix so it didn't come out perfect - seemed really greasy too because of not coating chips before adding and they were all at the top of the cake which also made it stick, even though I coated pan with Crisco and flour... Still tasted good ?
Going to make chocolate one again today - it disappeared within minutes and we all LOVED it!

This cake is amazing! It is so easy and is moist and chocolatey! I didn't change a thing! I'll make this again! I used milk chocolate ready made frosting to top it off! Not sure why people complained about chips going to the bottom, mine didn't. I had to cook an additional 15 minutes.

Fabulous recipe!  I used mini chocolate chips the second time (36 cupcakes) and liked it even more.  Also I drizzled chocolate and white chocolate glaze on them.  Absolutely delicious.  This is my most favorite dessert recipe.  Thank you!

I made this as s birthday cake with "satiny chocolate glaze" (a recipe I also found on this site) and strawberries on top. It was moist and dense and got rave reviews. I was most concerned that it would get stuck in the pan, but I let it cool completely overnight and it ca I will definitely make this again.

***Updating my review*** 

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. The versatility is outstanding. Over Christmas I wanted something besides chocolate cake, in spite of the Fam being seriously crazy about this one. (There's never any left over!)

Looked to see what I had...French vanilla cake mix, all the requisite spices for holiday recipes, several different flavors of pudding mix...hmmm...pumpkin spice pudding mix! 
Used the French vanilla cake mix, didn't separate the eggs though, because I wanted the richness of the egg yolk, (and because adding the pumpkin spice pudding would make it not so white anyway. Strictly a matter of personal preference, so if you prefer a lighter cake that is a bit less dense, omit the egg yolks).
 Added a tablespoon of real vanilla extract, a teaspoon of cinnamon and I used spiced rum in place of water. 
I topped it with a glaze of confectioners sugar mixed with a few drops of water, clear vanilla extract & a tsp of spiced rum. 

It is FABULOUS! 
I can't wait to try something else based on this chocolate cake recipe, which by itself is one of my favorites of all time, but as a base recipe for other cakes it is my go-to, ideal recipe for any event. 




Original review:

Needed something to take to a dinner tonight so I decided on this cake. I used a chocolate fudge cake mix and I only had a 3.5 oz box of pudding, so I used that. I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup and to make up the rest of the liquid I threw in 1/3 cup of milk into which I dis

Oh my goodness what a fabulous find! Super easy and super delicious! I made some macerated berries and fresh whipped cream to serve alongside (but sliced fresh berries alone would be fantastic too!). A big hit! Thanks for the recipe - a definite keeper :)

Wow, this is a great easy cake!  Very moist and lots of chocolate.  I used 1 cup mini chips and 1 cup regular size chips because that is what I had in the pantry.  I think the mini chips worked well because you don't end up with the larger "chunks" from the regular size.  Will make this over and over!!

I made the recipe as written, the only difference being my cake mix was not 18.25 ounces, don't know if they still sell that size.  It turned out very good, one of the best chocolate cakes I've had and definitely the best I've ever made. Everyone wants me to make it again and we are just finishing the first one. Made this icing recipe - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/8002/chocolate-ganache-icing/.

Made this for my son's 12th bday today & it is absolutely AMAZE-BALLS!!! I usually don't rate recipes if I didn't follow exactly, but this recipe was a great base. I made adjustments because I couldn't find 18.25 size box cake mix & also because I'm not fond of baking cakes using box cake mix. Figured I would give this recipe a shot since the reviews were so great. I used 15.25oz Betty Crocker Super Moist Choc Fudge, 2 sticks of real butter (in place of the oil), 1/2 cup brewed coffee (instead of water), 4 eggs(added 1 at a time), 1 cup sour cream, 1 tbls vanilla, and the full 2 cups of mini semisweet. Baked at 325 in a dark nonstick bundt cake pan for 1 hour...or maybe it was 1 hour 5 mins. Anyway, the result did not disappoint! Literally MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH!!! Birthday boy was very pleased! **Forgot to put in the pudding mix, but the cake mix I used already had it in the mix. Not sure if it would have really made a difference** Still turned out SUPER MOIST & tastes like it was made from scratch.

Ah-mazing!  Although I prefer making cakes from scratch, I took a chance on this cake and the results were heavenly. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and used only 1/2 cup oil, added 1/3 cup whole milk and used mini chocolate chips. This cake is so good, rich and moist it does NOT need frosting, just a dusting of powdered sugar.  I baked for 50 minutes and it was perfect.  Be sure to let it cool  completely before inverting to prevent sticking.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious. Doubled the recipe (for a crowd) and used pudding instead of pudding mix. Baked mine in a large, rectangular baking dish. Baked nicely within the 50-55 minute time period. Definitely making this again.

I changed nothing! Made everything exact and it's to die for! Topped with a chocolate almond frosting, drizzled with chocolate ganache and sprinkled mini choc chips on top! But it could have stood on its own with nothing on top! Made for a choc-a-holic and she called it the best chocolate cake she's ever had!

I have made this cake a number of times.  I usually substitute applesauce for the oil.  I have also made it with white cake mix, vanilla pudding and white chocolate morsels.  I prefer to use mini morsels as when I use the bigger chips they seem to sink to the bottom of the pan.  I use this when I make layered birthday cakes.

This is our go to cake for birthday's etc. I usually replace rum for the water, not sure why. I've made it many times and it's nice and easy. One day I must have been in the rum before baking, I forgot the eggs but the cake was still REALLY good. I think it would be tough to mess this cake up!

This cake is amazing!  I live in Denver, so it's very hard to bake here and have it not be dry.  Not a problem with this recipe- it comes out perfect EVERY time!!  I make my husband take the majority of it to work (b/c I shouldn't be eating half a cake) and one of his employees who is getting married asked me to make this for her wedding cake.  It's one of the best cakes I've ever eaten.  If you follow the recipe exactly you will NOT regret making this. I had a little problem making a cake with the cake mix as the base, but decided after eating it that I no longer care because it's so good.  I drizzle it with the Chocolate Ganache recipe from this site and it's amazing.  Two quick tips; 1. Use mini choc. chips (Ghiradelli works well), they melt better. 2. This recipe, as it states pretty clearly- is very chocolately.  Some reviewers have complained about too much chocolate.  That's literally in the name of the recipe- why would you be surprised by how chocolately it tastes?

This cake was a complete hit. I followed the recipe exactly and also used the ganache recipe to top it. It was absolutely amazing and I couldn't be happier with the results. My entire family loved it and it was the standout at the dinner party we had.

Excellent, moist and delicious, made exactly as shown. 
Be aware that the large number of chocolate chips used in the batter may prevent the testing toothpick from EVER coming out "clean", even after 55 minutes or more of baking. I took mine out at 60 min -- thankfully just before it started to burn on top! 
I used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe (also on allrecipes.com) for the icing and it too was easy to make and wonderful. This cake was a big hit at the party I took it to and this recipe has become the go-to chocolate cake in my house.
Another hint: Use Wilton Cake Release on your Bundt pan to assure that it will come out easily.

One word. AMAZING!  My husband and sister both said this is restaurant quality cake.  I make a lot of cakes and pies and such but this one "takes the cake" (pun intended) It is very chocolatey but is so tasty.  Will totally be making this one over and over again!

This is a very good cake. I made it for a friend's birthday, my husband absolutely loved it and insisted that I make it again on his birthday. However, it really can be "to much chocolate" cake. While our other friends liked it they couldn't finish a whole slice.

After 4K reviews, mine isn't needed, but... This cake is tasty and moist. Using mini chips adds just the right chocolate without noticeable 'pockets'.  I sent one to school with my kid who reports, "It tastes EXACTLY like a donut."  Apparently, if you leave a piece out all night the edges dry to fried donut consistency... we'll call that a college boy's "recipe".  Excellent cake, Denise.

I did not stray from this recipe. It turned out absolutely amazing. My boyfriend and my mom were in shock. It was perfect. This will forever be my go-to chocolate cake. It's not made completely from scratch but it was so easy to make and the kitchen was not a complete mess after I was done with it. The cake was moist and chocolaty. YUM YUM YUM! I added a bit more chocolate chips than the recipe said because I wanted it to be extra chocolaty. Also, I notice that some people wrote that there's too much oil in the recipe. NOT AT ALL. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE MOIST. This cake is heavenly and I am salivating at the very thought of it right now.

This cake is delicious.   I make it with only one cup of chocolate chips and ship it to my son in college.  It holds up well during shipping and has become an exam week standard.

Made this for a group dinner and everyone raved about it! I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the oil to 1/2 cup, and added 1/3 cup milk, and replaced the water with strong coffee.
My oven was wonky, and so this cake ended up sitting in a 250-degree ish oven for 3 hours - and it was STILL amazing!

I'm going to call this the Cheater's Chocolate Cake.  I was a little skeptical because of the ingredients but  indeed it was rich, moist, chocolatey and not too sweet.  Very easy. Package sizes are a little different here in Canada: two layer cake mix, 4 serving pudding mix  and 250 ml. sour cream worked fine.  I put a little butter cream icing and some slivered almonds on top but that was just to make it look fancy and wasn't needed for flavour.

Imake this and freeze slices in individual bags for the girls lunches, toss a bag in a lunch box.  Perfect.

On another note I have been known to make 2 at one time 1 to eat one to freeze.

I will never make a different chocolate cake recipe again!  This was hands down the best chocolate cake I have ever made or eaten!  I chose this recipe for a 4 tier wedding cake I made and it held up beautifully to the weight of the layers above.  Super moist, rich, and as chocolaty as they come, the guests were raving :)  I did reduce the oil to 3/4 c and thought that was perfect.  Bakes evenly and has a slight crust (which makes decorating a breeze!  Goodbye crumb coat!).

For an easy delicious presentation I buttered my Bundt pan and sprinkled very finely chopped walnuts on the entire pan, getting as much to stick as I could. (Only the finest pieces will stick. A nut mill works fine.) Then I poured in my batter and sprinkled a few more nuts on top. It turned out beautiful! The butter gives the cake a nice shine (unlike shortening) and the toasted nuts not only look good but also complement the flavor of this rich chocolate cake.

Excellent and very easy. If you add mini chocolate chips the toothpick test really isn't helpful - it will come out gooey with melted chocolate even if the cake is finished. Know your oven, trust the time and as long as the top is springy you'll be good. Rather than a glaze I combined this with a homemade amaretto whipped cream (heavy whipping cream + a dash of amaretto liqueur or almond extract   + 1 TBS of confectioner's sugar + tsp cream of tartar for stiffness). It was a nice complement.

This is the moistess chocolate bundt recipe ever!  For a taste twist, I added 1 tbsp instant coffee granules to the mixture.  Yum!

This is my husband's favorite cake! He asks me for it on every occasion and I've dressed it up a few different ways -all of them being delicious. I've done exactly as directed with just a sprinkling of powdered sugar -my husband loves it this way with some vanilla bean ice cream. I've also made it as a layered cake with the chocolate mousse recipe from "Chocolate Mousse Cake" -also on allrecipes. Or I've made it with a glaze. All have been amazing, this cake is so simple and I love how easy it is to incorporate it into other recipes or use with other ideas. Couldn't be more happy with it and I always get compliments on my baking when I make it. What more could you ask for? :)

Excellent recipe as is. I am not a cake lover as I find they are usually to dry for my taste preference.  But this is not dry and is absolutely delicious! Will be the only chocolate cake recipe I use from now on.  I did drizzle with Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe found on AR.  Thanks for the perfect chocolate cake!

It's moist and chocolatey, kinda gunky though. Went along with the recipe using an entire cup of oil. I would cut that back as other reviewers have suggested.

Great chocolate cake recipe!  I used mini chocolate chips and made cupcakes.  I topped half the cupcakes with chocolate buttercream and the other half with peanutbutter buttercream. Both options were delicious!

This cake was fantastic! I read the reviews before I baked and took different people's advice. I cut the vegetable oil to 1/2 a cup and added 1/3 cup of milk. I also used 1bag of mini chips inside the cake mix and then I combined a second bag with a little heavy cream to ice the cake. Super yummy!

Editing my previous review, because I've used this recipe for a few years now with many variations.  I just love that I can switch the pudding and cake mixes and end up with something completely different, yet just as wonderful.
My favorites are 1. triple chocolate fudge cake mix with chocolate pudding and mini milk chocolate chips and 2. white cake mix with white chocolate pudding mix and white chocolate chips.  I have turned a few of the white chocolate ones into rainbow cakes for fun.  Tomorrow, I'll make a butterscotch variant!
The mini chips are so much better than full chips.  Unfortunately, mini chips only come in milk chocolate, so I'll chop up the full chips in other flavors if I'm not feeling super lazy.
Before this recipe, I always kept away from cake mixes.  This recipe has taught me that, with a little tinkering, even boxed mixes can taste homemade.

I made this exactly as called for, with the exception of a 3.9 oz box of pudding.  It turned out wonderful! Very chocolatey and rich.  We sprinkled some powdered sugar on it and that was just right.  I think if it had frosting on it, it would be too rich.  Loved this with a big glass of cold milk and will definitely make it again!

Made this for a party. I used fat free sour cream and half of the pudding mix I used was sugar free. I also used mini chocolate chips and baked it in an angel food cake pan because I didn't have a bundt pan. It was so delicious! Everyone loved it.

Made with sugar free pudding and milk chocolate chips. Torted into 4 layers and filled with chocolate buttercream and covered in chocolate ganache and almonds. My hubby said it was the best cake he had ever eaten. This will be my go-to recipe from now on!

I used a sugar free cake mix, sugar fee pudding, and Hershey sugar free chocolate chips, and this was wonderful.  My family wanted me to make another one as soon as they had finished the cake off.  Will be making this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I played with this to bring calorie count down - one reviewer used applesauce instead of oil. Works great. I also used 60% dark chocolate chips - they were a bit large so I gave them a little time in a food processor to wittle them down in size - this turned out wonderful - made into mini cupcakes (baked about 11-14 minutes) to share with a few dozen people - they were rich and there were no left overs. This is a great recipe.

Awesome chocolate cake!  I used a 15.25 Betty Crocker Super Moist Devil's Food Cake Mix. I also used only one box of JELL-O 3.9 oz. chocolate instant pudding.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as stated. I did use Hershey's Mini Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips. I generously sprayed my nonstick bundt pan with a vegetable oil spray.  The cake came out perfectly after waiting the 1 1/2 hours to invert it on a serving platter.  It is so moist, rich, and delicious.  I will definitely be making this cake again!

"I like the crust - it's like a cookie - the inside is really good too." My 10 year old son said as he stuffed his face with cake. "It's excruciatingly delicious" My 42 year old husband said and "Yummy" said my 2 1/2 year old. I think they liked it! I liked it but prefer the Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake from this site that is very similar. Made just as stated only I used mini chocolate chips as someone suggested.

Did not dissapoint! 
 Really moist and yummy. I added a Satiny chocolate icing...chocolate, melted butter and honey and sprinkle walnuts on the top. Delish!
I also replaced water with warm coffee...just for an extra rich flavor! 
Quick and easy winner.

I love this recipe! I'm not the best cook nor baker, and this recipe made baking a delicious chocolate cake SO easy!  The cake turned out moist and 5-star restaurant quality.  I lightly sifted powdered sugar on top of the cake and added fresh raspberries. Delish!  This is my favorite chocolate cake even over store-bought!

I'll admit that I was concerned about making this cake because I have a recipe off of this site that I always use that is made from scratch.  BUT I made this and well, it was worth trying.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and cut the oil, added milk and used less chocolate chips than called for.  I also left the cake in the pan for 1 1/2 hours as directed.  This cake is dark, moist and oh so so good!  People will NEVER know that it is an "altered" box mix.  I made the chocolate glaze that others suggested and it just took it over the top.  I tasted the cake after I took it out of the pan and I still wasn't convinced but after letting the cake sit overnight and tasting it the next day, all I can say is YUM!  I will make this cake again and I will experiment with additional flavors.

Very very good! I used chocolate frosting on top and served with strawberries. The combination got good reviews, so in the future I will probably slice the strawberries and place on top.

This cake is so moist and I like the texture.  I followed it as written but next time I may mix instant coffee in the warm water.  Another time maybe a little cinnamon.

This was a good cake, but not fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I will probably consider other recipes next time I make a chocolate cake.  I just don't think the outcome justified the cost (for a cake mix, sour cream, pudding mix, and a whole bag of chocolate chips).  I think I could have made something equally good cooking completely from scratch.

This is an outstanding cake!  I have made it three times and it has been a hit each time.  It is perfect with Hershey's chocolate frosting recipe made with Penzeys dutch processed cocoa.  I just served it at my neighborhood block party Nd everyone raved.  You can't go wring with this moist and yummy cake!

Oh my!!  This was amazing....both in taste and ease of preparation.  I did decrease the oil to 3/4 cup, and may decrease a bit more next time.  A huge hit here; deemed a 'make again' from the first bite.  Thank you for your award winning recipe!

If you really want to make it CHOCOLATE, get the double chocolate cake mix with pudding already in it and mix as directed.  Add a large double chocolate instant pudding mix.  Add mini chocolate chips.  Bake in a sheet pan as directed.  When cooking time is finished, remove from oven, poke holes in top of cake and pour (drizzle) an entire can of real chocolate syrup on top.  Serve hot with ice cream.  I call Killer Chocolate Cake.

My boys could not get enough of this chocolaty cake!  I used the Duncan Hines cake mix (16.25 oz) and mixed with 2 boxes of pudding (2.1 oz each) and the other ingredients listed.  To make cupcakes, I filled the cupcake lines 3/4 of the way and baked for about 25 mins.  Very yummy!

This cake is absoloutley fabulous!! I made it for my husband's birthday. It was rich but not overpowering. The only change I made was instead of devils food cake mix I used chocolate. I also made a simple ganache and drizzled it and some pecans on top. This cake was a HUGE hit. it was devoured by my family in 2 days! I completley recoment this recipe!!

I do not bake.. I love to cook, but for secretary's day i wanted to do something special.. so i attempted this recipe.  AMAZING! It was chocolaty, moist, slightly gooey in places and needed a strong cup of coffee to compliment it:)  upon reading the reviews, i think i will try the mini chocolate chips. That would be the only thing i changed for this recipe.  it is perfect as is.  Thank you!

I just made 4 dozen cupcakes with this recipe for my son's birthday party, and at least 10 different people came up to tell me how amazing they were. Some tips for making Too Much Chocolate Cupcakes: Each recipe yields about 2 dozen cupcakes, and the recipe doubles very easily. Bake every dozen at 350 for 24 minutes. Let the cupcakes rest in the cupcake pans until slightly cool before removing. Do not use double weight, waxed cupcake liners (which is what I used to make the cupcakes). The amount of oil in the recipe makes the cake super moist but also a bit oily, which made the liners come apart from the actual cake after being kept overnight. You're better off using regular, thin cupcake liners, which stick to the cakes better. Also, I accidentally made the marshmallow frosting that went on top of the cupcakes a tiny bit salty (the recipe I used called for "pinches of salt" and I might have added a pinch too much), but many of my guests said they loved how the slightly salty icing complemented the sweet cake. So if you're making an icing try making it a bit saltier than you normally would. Thanks again to Denise for this wonderful recipe!

This recipe is ALL over the blogging world... and now I know why! I typically make my cakes from scratch, but found that doesn't always yield the perfect results when I need to make the cake in the Pampered Chef Batter Bowl for barbie cakes. So, I broke down and make this recipe after my sister had great success with it. Deliciously moist and wonderful - baked up beautifully! I baked at 350 for about 75 minutes for the batter bowl cakes, then used the recipe again in two 8" round pans. This gave me a couple extra inches to plunge the (plastic-wrapped) barbie into the cake without taking drastic measures like chopping offer her legs (as some people have reportedly done...really).  So, two barbie cakes used 3 batches of this recipe. A keeper. At least for Barbie cakes.

made this for the bf and my cousins, they loved it! Its a good base to build on or substitute with your available ingredients. For me the changes i made were - yoghurt instead of sour cream, and followed the reviews to half the oil (i used 100ml) and added about 100ml milk. I used only the 3.9oz pudding pack, strong coffee instead of water and tossed in about 2 heaping Tbsp of cocoa for a stronger chocolate taste. Cooked for way longer than 55mins, 1.5 hrs instead.

Yes, indeed you will have too much chocolate! I used a mixture of regular & mini chocolate chips (that's just what I had on hand) and I thought it was very excellent! Almost like a lava cake... yummmyyy!!!

This is my GO TO recipe for family gatherings or potlucks.  I USED to be all about making stuff from scratch and being so proud of it, but nothing can touch the awesomeness of this cake.  Plus its SO easy to make it takes me 5 or 10 mins and its in the oven.  I usually take mine out after 45 mins give or take so check it early.

This has become my friends and families FAVORITE cake.  I make it according to the recipe, and don't be fooled by the thick batter, it comes out moist and delicious everytime.  I top it the with the Satiny Glaze found on this site and sprinkle some powder sugar and walnuts on top.  It always gets rave reviews. Some reviews have stated that the edges are crispy - I use a dark bundt pan and decrease the oven temp to 325.  It seems the lower temp eliminates that problem.   THIS IS A MUST MAKE CAKE.  Chocolate lovers must try it .. YOU'LL LOVE IT.

This cake was delicious.  I didn't have a full cup of sour cream and think it would have been even more moist with it.  The chocolate chips are a must.  It tastes great with them.  I topped the cake with powdered sugar and it was perfect.  I can't I aging putting a frosting on this, it would be too much.  I'll be making this again!

Amazing cake!!!Moist, chocolate-y perfection!!! I wanted it to be more birthday cake-like so I ventured out and did a triple, 8inch round layered cake.. I would NOT do it again..Icing it was extremely difficult!!! I had to melt the icing and pour it over since the cake was SUPER moist and kept falling apart!!! So, stick to the recipe, bundt pan and you will be very happy! :-).. DELISH!

This is just awesome.  You might be tempted to add icing to this cake, but DON'T.  It is just terrific. Jello now makes a Devil's food flavored instant chocolate pudding mix and I used that instead of regular chocolate pudding mix.  Trust me, this will go in a hurry....

This is a delicious and moist cake. I made it a couple of times, but each time I omitted the chocolate chips, and found it was just as delicious. I was using a dark cake pan, so the edges were slightly burned when I followed the directions exactly. Lowering the oven temp 25 degrees fixed that completely. I will continue to make this cake.

I brought this cake to a dinner party we went to on Valentines day. A-MA-ZING!!
I also drizzled the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" (found on this site) over the top. 
No need to cut back on the oil. It turned out absolutely perfect! 
I did use mini chocolate chips as another suggested. Thanks for this awesome recipe! I will absolutely be making this again!

A friend of mine gave me a similar recipe.  Everything is the same except with no oil and light sour cream.  It was very chocalatey and rich and saves you around 180 calories per serving.

Wow! Wow! Wow! I love to bake cakes and cookies. But I Must say this one seems to be the best one yet! I did have one substituted item, I didn't have sour cream so I used mascarpone (Italian sour cream often used in tiramisu). It came out so moist, soft and extra chocolatey! Loved it!

I really liked this recipe.  I made it exactly as written and used it in my "cake pop" pan.  I baked them for 20 minutes at 350 and they came out really tastey.  I drizzled them with melted mint chocolate chips and they were amazing.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will keep this one with my cake pop pan and use it over and over.

OMG! This is the bomb! I don't like cake as a general rule...too dry but I had to come up with a birthday cake for some one I wanted to impress...you know the way to a mans heart is threw his stomach...soo I tried this as a test run on the kids and we all agree it is the only one I will be making anymore! Can't wait for him to try it!  This is really a 15 star cake!

I made this with a plain chocolate cake mix and a bag of mini semi sweet chocolate chips. It was good. served it with whipped cream instead of any icing. Not too sweet.

Do no try icing this cake or you will go into a sugar coma! LOL. This is so sweet and rich and smooth. Yummy! The flavor was just like those giant chocolate chip muffins only more moist. Keeper!

What more can I say? This is perfection. Added some espresso powder (sooooo goooood for adding depth to the chocolate....even if you don't like coffee). Topped with satiny chocolate glaze, sometimes I make the glaze with peanut butter chips, or a mixture of peanut butter and chocolate chips.

I don't understand all the rave reviews. This was a good cake, not a fantastic cake. I made it twice: once as the recipe directed in a bundt pan, and a second time with a few adjustments from other reviews in cake pans for a layer cake. I'm a chocoholic, and I thought this would be perfect for me, but it wasn't "too much chocolate". Again, it's a good cake. It's just not the best chocolate cake I've ever made. Sorry.

This cake is delicious...after reading other comments I used 1Stick of butter and 1/4	cup of oil.  I also cooked it at 335 and started checking it every 5 minutes at the 35 to 40 min mark.  You have to watch a chocolate cake so it doesn't taste 'burnt'.  The batter is very thick but cooks up nicely.  Do to smaller cake mixes just reduce the wet ingredients by a fraction to make up for it.  It does not need frosting, as it is plenty sweet.  Add a splash of Grand Marnier if so inclined.   This is a keeper.

I just made this in cupcake form and it was PERFECT. Very rich but not too sweet. I think the pudding mix and sour cream balance out the sweetness nicely. NOTE: Use mini chocolate chips for best results!

O.k, I went a little over the top and used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze"recipe I found on this site.  Talk about TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE CAKE! Wow is all I can say!  I made this for my "chocolate loving" mother-in-law for her 87th birthday and she loved it!  Can't wait to make it again!

Without a doubt the BEST cake-mix cake I've ever baked!  It was so quick and easy, and tasted SO good!  Next time I will make it a day ahead of time, as the "leftovers" tasted even better the 2nd day. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I made this as written.  It came out fine, but I wasn't that impressed.  Maybe my expectations were too high due to the rave reviews but I felt like I'd had much better chocolate cake before.  It wasn't as moist as I thought it would be and the flavor left a little to be desired.  Good but nothing special.

Seriously didn't think it would be amazing.  I figured the ingredients were far too simple to make something that wonderful.  I was wrong! This is a super tasty and super rich cake.  It's not too chocolatey.  I did need to bake for an additional 20 minutes.  And, I used 60% cocoa chips. This will be my go to, super easy, super fast, and beyond super yum.

This turned out great! I did make some changes. I used a little less oil, maybe 3/4 cup, I added the 1TBS of Vanilla, I only had a small package of pudding, so used that. My cake mix had no pudding in it. I was a bit nervous, but this was perfect!! Also cooked it as directed 30 min at 350 and 45 min at 300 and used mini chocolate chips. Perfect. Just served with powdered sugar. This was rich and just right. Passed this along, so easy to make. Dump it all in, hand mixed, used butter to grease the pan, and perfect.

OMG this is good! Made a few changes as suggested by others: decreased oil to 1/2 cup; added 1/3 c milk; and used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips instead of 2 cups of regular. Also, made satiny chocolate glaze from this site. This is a keeper for sure!

Very good!! Made cupcakes instead of the cake and they turned out awesome.  I made 12 normal sized cupcakes and 54 mini cupcakes, baked for about 20 mins.  This will replace my chocolate cupcake recipe for sure!!!

My wife and I had a couple of Christmas parties to attend so since I've been off work for a few weeks I told her that I would make a cake for us to attend.  I've made this cake twice (really I'm Not a cook and not a baker) and followed the recipe exactly.  I used the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" recipe found elsewhere.  I received glowing reviews with folks at first not believing that I'm the one who made the cake...then asking for the recipe.  Thanks to all the other reviewers.  Many of your comments helped me choose this recipe.  My next project is a Red Velvet Cake!

STOP LOOKING FOR CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE I made this as written but with milk instead of water. When it cooled I thought it was ok But, the next day & 2 days after it was Wonderful! Super moist & chocolately I live in NYC & you would think there are the best bakeries but, every time I buy chocolate cake it's always lacking flavor & almost artificial . This beats them. When you need a chocolate fix this is it. " I want to know if it would work for cake ball?"

I was not impressed with this cake at all. It didn't taste much better than a regular box cake.

This came out perfect!  I did not use any frosting or glaze since it was chocolaty enough on its own. Only topped with a bit of powdered sugar just for the look of it. I also cut down the oil as others had to ½ cup and used the mini choc chips instead of standard size, this left the chips throughout the cake and they did not sink to the bottom.
I will definitely make this again, it was a winner!

I followed the recipe exactly and at a couple points had to double check because things didn't seem right. The batter was SUPER thick and then it didn't seem as if it was going to cook. At the end of 50 minutes the top was wet and the toothpick came out totally gooey. Somehow, though, after about five more minutes, it was perfect. I'm not sure how that happened, but this cake was a HUGE hit with everyone. Even those who don't care for chocolate cake. So moist and delicious. Topped with a chocolate ganache... perfection.

I couldn't even get to the step of actually baking this cake I think the amount of instant pudding is incorrect...  I can't even get my mixer to spin through it... I am sure this would be a really great cake it I could actually get it to the point of baking it.  I used 5.9 0z of instant pudding they don't sell a box that size so I bought smaller boxes and measured it out... After I saw how thick it was I read those boxes and they say2.1 oz (59 g)

VERY GOOD!! I don't even like chocolate cake, but this one was really good! I made it for my daughter's Thanksgiving Feast at school and it got rave reviews! I had to make an extra one just for my husband and he took some to work; all of them loved it too. (It stays moist too!) 
Will def make again!

Made this for my daughter & son-in-law's pre-thanksgiving dinner.  Used the 'healthy' version (sugar free pudding, light sour cream, egg beaters & applesauce instead of oil).  No one knew the difference and everyone LOVED it.  Great 'semi-homemade' recipe and a keeper in my house!

This cake was delicious! The only part of the recipe I changed was the oil. I used 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup and it was still really moist. I probably could have even used 1/2 cup. I baked it a little differently though. I wanted to make a birthday cake so I used a 12 inch round cake pan (2 inches deep). I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes and it came out perfect.

There is no such thing as too much chocolate! This is an absolutely decadent cake! I baked the cake exactly as written. I didn’t have a bundt pan, and baked it in a tube/angel food cake pan instead. I did need to bake it for 10 minutes longer, but I’m not sure if it was because of the pan I used or if my oven temperature may be off. I drizzled over the cake a chocolate glaze flavored with Bailey’s Irish Cream, and everyone was in chocolate heaven! Everyone asked for the recipe, and a few of them went home and made their own with rave reviews. One served it with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge – how yummy does that sound?! Another friend added chopped nuts. Still another made a Black Cherry Chocolate glaze by using the flavored syrup used in coffee and hot chocolate. The variations to go with this cake are many! It is a very moist and dense cake, and worth every calorie! It is a very easy and impressive cake to bake and serve. As for the folks who have problems with the regular sized chocolate chips sinking, just dust them with flour prior to folding into the batter, and they will stay afloat during the baking process. This recipe is a definite keeper!!

(I also used the mini chips as was suggested.  It added to the richness of the cake without giving away the ingredient)

Wow! is all I can say, Wow! I added about 1/2 c. chopped almonds to the batter and some orange zest to the choco butter cream frosting. It was the best. I will be making this again, and Again, and again.

Made with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze receipe from this site. Amazing, amazing results. Baked for an office birthday. Huge hit. Moist, very decadent, delish! BTW, if you make some chocolate dipped strawberries and lined them around the cake, it looks and tastes fantastic as well and will add that special tartness from the strawberries to cut the sweetness of the cake.

Seriously the BEST chocolate cake ever.  I'm not a huge fan, because I think most aren't very moist. This is so moist and so yummy...a friend picked up a piece and ate it right out of her hand with no fork, plate or napkin..like she'd never experienced chocolate cake before!!  I've made it with Devil's Food cake mix, Milk Chocolate cake mix and most recently Chocolate Fudge cake mix...Devil's Food was definitely the best.  If using a dark pan reduce the temp 25 degrees and check for doneness a little under the minimum cooking time.  Doesn't need frosting on top...overkill for sure!  (sprinkle powdered sugar if you must:)

It doesn't raise much after mixing, which I'll keep in mind for next time, especially if I choose to make cupcakes again. I used mini chocolate chips and made this into cupcakes.  I dipped each cupcake in a chocolate ganache. Everyone that tried this cake loved it!

This cake is great!  I use the mini chips because they don't sink to the bottom and stick to the pan.  Also when I make it in a bundt I bake it at 325 for 75 minutes because when I do it at 350 because the batter is so thick the top burns for me.  So lowering the heat and lengthing the time takes care of that.

Very delicious - I made this into cupcakes and it easily made 24. I am going to play around with the brand/variety of cake and other brands of pudding because I want the chocolate flavor to be a bit darker. Also used mini chips which did not melt in the cupcakes but were a great addition to each bite!

Delicious cake.  I followed other reviewer's advice and cut the oil back to 3/4 cup.  Also used 1/2 cup less chocolate chips.  Came out great. 
I made 2 round cakes and frosted it for a birthday cake, rather than bundt.

Wow, this was excellent! Ive tried alot of different recipes from this website, and I think this is the best recipe on the site! I of course followed the suggestions of others (reduced oil, added milk, reduced amt of choc chips) and the result was perfect. I couldnt stop eating it,I had two pieces and still nibbled more as I put it away! Highly recommend

Our family loved tis cake.  It came out of the pan perfectly.  I used butter-flavored Pam spray before baking.  I didn't need any icing.  Plenty of chocolate!

This recipe is fantastic! I prefer to make all of my baked goods from scratch, but I have to admit... This recipe is just as good as any chocolate cake I've ever made. It's incredibly moist and very rich! Everyone loved it! Fast and easy and as another poster mentioned it is best made with mini chocolate chips since they melt so well. Will definitely be my go-to recipe for a chocolate overload cake!

Is everyone eating the same cake as me and my husband???? This taste like a box brownie and is good for that much, but is not as amazing as everyone has talked it up. I'm sorry, but I have to go against the crowd and say this was just okay. I hate to see the other contestants in the county fair.

My husband and kids made this cake for my birthday.  They followed the recipe exactly, but did add a powdered sugar based glaze over the top.  It came out perfectly and so incredibly chocolatey!  It is very rich and a small piece goes a long way!  A keeper for sure!

I too am giving this a 5 star!!!  Needed a chocolate cake for my sis-in-laws birthday yesterday.  Decided to try this recipe. Mixed it all together and then couldn't find my bundt pan. I went into a small panic but then decicded to give it a shot in two 8X8 pans.  It worked perfect! Checked it after 30 mins.  Total time cooking was about 37 minutes.  It was INCREDIBLY PERFECT!!!  I also used the mini chocolate chips. Everyone raved over it even my 5 and 3 year old. :)  Thank you so much for sharing.

8/11 korri's house:  fabulous.  i followed exactly except i used only 3/4 cup of oil which made it plenty moist.  i also don't have a bundt pan and used a tube pan with no problems.  dusted with powdered sugar.  used mini chips (good).  served with cool whip and fresh berries.  everyone loved it.
8/2014 made for korri again. great, really moist, with berries and reddi whip.

Watch the outside crust as it easily gets overcooked as others have found.  Otherwise, this was quite good!

I had been looking for an easy, moist chocolate cake recipe. I am VERY pleased with this one. I didn't have any chocolate pudding mix but used some instant Dutch cocoa I had on the shelf. Didn't use the chocolate chips and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup as suggested by previous reviews. Even with the changes it turned out awesome! Very good base recipe that can be played with for experimentation.

This was really good....BUT don't overcook it like I did!!! It still came out moist, but if I would not have left in for an extra 10-15 mins-it would have been perfect! I thought it wasn't done, I guess because it was extra moist! I will be retrying:) Oh and by the way, I did use mini chocolate chips! Yummy!

Used this cake recipe for a bridal shower cake I made. Rave reviews all around! I was really impressed with how level the cakes were (I made two nine-inch round cakes) and how moist it seemed. I would like to cut down on the cup of oil some how, but I haven't quite figured that out yet. Either way, its going in my recipe book! Thanks a bunch!

I made this cake one night when my daughter had all of her friends coming over. They LOVED it! There was not a piece left the next day. I topped it with the recipe "Satiny chocolate glaze" and it was just perfect!

I usually prepare the recipe exactly as shown so I can really rate it fairly,but I just had a 1/2 cup of oil so I used 1/2 cup applesauce. All the other ingredients the same. Turned out great. I did glaze it with a vanilla glaze to cut back on all the chocolate. It was very rich, but everyone liked it. A little to much chocolate for my taste.

I usually didn't use box cake mix, but I gave this recipe a try. I substituted 1/2 cup oil w/ apple sauce, milk instead of water (apple sauce & milk help firm up the cake texture) & only used 1 1/4 semi sweet , chocolate chips. Great taste, very moist & not too sweet!

Delicious!  I substituted the 1 cup of vegetable oil with 1 cup of applesauce (not the chunky kind), and split the batter between two loaf pans for smaller cakes.

The BEST chocolate cake I have ever had/made.  Made it a 4 layer cake with milk chocolate frosting for a birthday party.  People are still asking me about it and asking if I'd consider selling it regularly.

Made this cake on Memorial Day. Great cake! Very dense, moist, de-lish! I iced it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe, and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top of it like the way it looks in the photo with the icing. Absolutely wonderful cake!

I have made this cake twice and it has been a hit each time!  People have asked me for the recipe and are shocked to know that it's an adapted cake mix!  I did as a few reviewers suggested and lowered the oil to 1/2 cup and added milk to still add moisture. It worked out great! The cake stayed very moist, even a couple days later! I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site...but I doubled it!  You have to try this recipe!

This has got to be the best semi-homemade cake EVER! I read through the reviews and wanted to try some variations but I didn't have time to make a test version, so I followed the recipe with the exception of using only 3/4 c. oil and mini chocolate chips. Baked in a fancy bundt pan for 55 minutes. I was concerned that it wasn't quite done but it ended up just a tiny bit gooey near the center and everybody raved about it. Just a dusting of powdered sugar on top was perfect. Next time I would cut the oil to 1/2 cup and replace some with homemade applesauce, which is what I always do for my breads (zucchini, banana, etc.). The mini chocolate chips melt so there is no issue of them sinking to the bottom of the pan. I don't know how someone could not love this chocolate heaven if they follow the recipe.

Made this with a Betty Crocker devil's food gluten-free cake mix.  You actually need TWO mixes, since they make a smaller cake.  It was SO good!  Doctored up that mix so much you can hardly tell it's gluten-free!  I made these into mini cupcakes for my gluten-free daughters b-day treat.  They were gobbled up.

Made the cake according to recipe, but used a different baking pan. I used 2 round 8 inch pans to make a double layer cake. turned out really great, but I think I cooked it a teensy bit too long because the bottoms were a little crisp. All in all, it was a great recipe, and If i would have had the bundt pan, it would have fared better.

well, it's my nature to tweak recipes so this one was no different. I used a small SF/FF box of chocolate pudding, 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce. I only used 1c mini chocolate chips and I tossed them in flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottom. I used Duncan Hines Devils food because in my  humble opinion it's the BEST cake ever ;) 
the cake batter was very thick and I admit I was concerned about that. It baked for 1 hour. IT IS BY FAR THE MOST MOIST AND DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER.

Let me just say that I've been baking and cooking all week (have a full house so i get to use them as guinea pigs for my culinary experiments) and this is by far my favorite! I followed this to a T and baked only 50 min. PERFECT! I was seriously impressed. A little powdered sugar ( mostly for looks) and this puppys ready to roll! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!!

As far as I know there haven't been any reviews when it comes to making cupcakes with this recipe. Well, I made cupcakes with this yesterday. Jumbo cupcakes. 
They turned out GREAT. 
However, I only baked them for 45 minutes. Any longer and they would have been too done. 
Oh, and while I was baking I completely forgot to put the pudding in. They still turned out moist and delicious. I baked them for a bake sale and they were gone in no time. 
So, next time I make these I'll remember the pudding. I can't wait to see how they turn out. I can't imagine these being any more delicious.

This is the BEST chocolate cake! Very moist and fluffy. I didn't have a devils food cake mix but I had a swiss chocolate cake mix and used it and I used milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet since that's all I keep to use. I cooked this cake in 2 9" pans and paired it with the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting recipe from this site and they were perfect together. If I could rate it higher than a 5 I would! Definitely a keeper!!!!!

Jackie Olden gave out this recipe on her radio show nearly 20 years ago, and it's been my family's favorite ever since.  Sometimes I layer the bittersweet chocolate chips with fresh raspberries and icing it with whipped cream for sheer decadence!

Try something different ... use a Cherry Chip Cake Mix (instead of Chocolate) ... gives this chocolate cake a new twist.  Obviously not as chocolatey - but still delicious with a chocolate/cherry taste!   No matter how you do it - you can't go wrong with this recipe.

I was nervous about this at first because the batter was so thick.  Followed the directions perfectly and it came out great.  I dusted it with powdered sugar more for looks and everyone loved it!  I'm not allowed to make any other dessert now. :)

Excellent cake for the chocolate lover. I made it with mini chips and it worked great. Only thing, it took WAY longer than 55 minutes to cook. I would say it was closer to 90.

I made this cake yesterday for a party....there were 4 other dessert and this one went fast! It is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and was a bit nervous. There were some reviews that said that 1 cup of oil was too much. let me tell you it is not. You need to make this cake, it will not let you down!

No such thing as too much chocolate in my book, but wow this cake will definitely satisfy your chocolate cravings.  I made it the first time exactly as stated & loved it, but made a few changes the second time around which I thought made it better:  To reduce the fat & because it is a tad bit greasy I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce & 1/2 cup oil, I also used reduced fat sour cream. The one thing that I did that I think made the biggest difference...I substituted 1/2 cup of strong coffee for the 1/2 cup of water. It gives the cake an extra added dimension of richness, and also made it taste entirely homemade, you don't get any of that subtle out of the box cake flavor that I think the recipe has a bit of when you make it exactly as written.  Fantastic over all though, regardless of if you tweek it or not. Thanx Denise!

OMG!!!  This was totally amazing!  And I am not even a chocolate lover.  I used 1/2 the amount of oil and it was still incredibly moist.  The chocolate chips make it over the top. It doesn't even need frosting.  Delicious!

It's a great cake, but I originally found this recipe on the back of the McCormick Pure Vanilla Extract box and have been making it for years. You can use any kind of cake/pudding combo and it comes out great. I recently made it with white cake mix, vanilla pudding, and mini chocolate chips. It was so decadent and everyone loved it.

I made this for my FIL's birthday.  Baked 2 9" layers at 325 for about 35 minutes.  Filled with raspberry preserves and frosted with Rich Chocolate Frosting.  My chocoholic FIL LOVED this cake, and so did everyone else.  My devil's food cake had pudding in the mix and I used a small package of chocolate pudding mix instead of the 5.9 oz pkg called for.  I also used mini chips.  Great cake!!

Made this cake for a birthday. Only changes: 1/2 c oil 1/3 c milk, 1 c mini chocolate chips, and I used dark chocolate cake mix. and Used the Satin Ganache recipe from this site. The cake came out perfect and moist. I may try it the original version next time, however after reading some of the reviews made me nervous and I was on a time crunch to get it done. Everyone still raved about it and had seconds and the recipient wanted to know how I made it. She absolutely LOVED it. Thank you Denise for sharing this recipe. I can definately see how  you won 1st Prize!

Just made this cake for my DIL's birthday.  Turned out delicious.  Will definitely keep for future use.  Only thing I changed was I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil rather than 1 cup oil.  Cake was moist and didn't look or taste like a cake mix.  Nine year old grandson asked me to write the recipe off for him for the Recipe Box I gave him.

This cake was a hit. It's rich but not too heavy and the chocolate chips in the batter make each bite extra chocolatey. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used light sour cream, sugar free pudding mix and applesauce instead of oil. The cake was excellent and you'd never guess it wasn't the full fat/calorie version. I'll be making it again.

This turned out really moist and soooo good.  It didn't look great until I cut into it and beware...you'll have a hard time putting your fork down.  I sprinkled mine with powdered sugar for some color but would be devine with a chocolate drizzle!

How can anyone say this cake was dry?!  It was moist and delicious but then again i did add a little coffee to it and maybe just a tad more sour cream.  Also, we dribbled some kahlua over the cake while it was still warm and my husband went nuts for this cake!  Thanks, Denise!

Wonderful! I made this for a coworker's birthday. I served it with caramel sauce and whipped cream. Delicious! I did find that it needed to bake for approximately 10 more minutes than the reciped stated.

Super moist. Really good cake. Doesn't need frosting  -- although a nice chocolate drizzle as shown would be great. Don't buy the store-bought brand name cake mix company's bottled chocolate glaze -- it was awful. But this cake was wonderful. Can't beat it for how easy it is. The Barefoot Contessa's Beatty's chocolate cake & frosting is still the best I've ever had, but this is a great one too.

THIS CAKE IS SO AWESOME!!!!!!  Used 1/2 cup canola oil instead of the 1 cup of veg oil, and baked for 53 minutes and it came out perfect. 
First time I made this I used the big chocolate chips, the second time I used the mini chocolate chips. I don't know why exactly but the mini chips were better in this cake.

Fantastic, moist chocolate cake! I love making this for parties and get-togethers. Everyone loves it! It looks really pretty and fancy if you sprinkle some powdered sugar over the top before serving.

Awesome cake! After a few shots I finally figured out my combo: substituted Starbucks Mocha Frappaccino (in the glass jar at the store) for the water, used 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk instead, used 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips instead, and finally added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also baked it at 350 for the first 40 minutes and then turned it down to 300 for the last 15 minutes. I let it cool for an hour and then topped it with a cream cheese glaze (Mix 4 ounces cream cheese, 1 tablespoon butter, 2 cups confectioner's sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 tablespoon milk. Heat in microwave in 15 second intervals until smooth.)

Fantastic cake. The pudding mix keeps it wonderfully moist, and it's no lie, there's a great amount of chocolate in this thing.

It's so semi-homemade it reminds me of Sandra Lee - love it!

I have a weird oven, and being at sea level, I need to bake it next time at 330 for 52 minutes. check often in the final 10 min and use toothpicks.

I love, love chocolate. Let's get that out of the way right now.  That being said, as many other reviewers said, this cake is dense, and for me, I've realized I'd rather have a light and airy cake.  In the future, if I want dense, I'll make brownies or fudge.  As a huge chocolate lover, I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I think it actually just may have just have been......too....much....chocolate...cake.  

I used a Duncan Hines fudge cake mix, and followed the recipe exactly.  Mine wasn't all that moist, which was surprising, given the amount of reviews raving about the moistness of the cake.
 I frosted it with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site, so to be fair it may have made a better pairing with some sort of cream cheese or other non chocolate frosting.  

If I were to ever use this recipe again, I would definitely try some other pairings, as suggested by some other people - maybe try to give it more depth and flavor by using peanut butter or butterscotch combinations (in the chips and/or a non-fudge cake mix base).

I never imagined how many compliments I would get making this cake.  Everyone who even thought about this cake loved it!!  I ended up having to make it twice in the same week, and once was for my husband who swears he hates cake and chocolate.  I've been getting requests ever since.    Personal twists include: baking it as three 9-inch rounds, homemade whip cream for the filling between layers, homemade chocolate ganache for the frosting, and chocolate curls to dress it up (just find a huge hershey's bar and a potato peeler!).  So happy with how it came out.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

We loved it!   It was very moist.  Be careful not to overbake.  My 2nd time making this cake, i baked it  a little too long and it made the outside a bit crispy and ever so slightly burned.....although it was still amazing (and the middle was still moist).  I highly recommend this cake.

Modification:  I accidentally left the chocolate chips on the stove when I was preheating and they melted the first time I made this.  I put them in anyway and the cake won raves from my family the second time I made sure I did not melt the chips and the cake was not liked as well.  So ever since I have melted the chips in a double boiler before adding them in and have always have had raves ever since.    Try it!!!

STOP! Search no more THIS is the chocolate cake recipe you want.  My youngest turns 5 this week and requested chocolate cake with no frosting.  There is no way this needs frosting. PERFECT! Made per directions, doubled recipe and made 48 cupcakes. My house smells divine;-)

This is a great rich chocolate cake sure to please any chocoholics desire. The cake is so moist and full of chocolate there is really no need for any icing or frosting. The only mod I made to this cake was to use milk instead of water like I do in all cake recipes. Delicious.

I made Mini Cupcakes with this recipe! My husband brought them to his work for his birthday and everyone loved them! What is awesome about this recipe is when you bite into the cake, there are chocolate chips in them, like a cookie would have. This cake is my all time favorite now, I loved it and didn't change a thing!

This cake was a knockout and so incredibly warm, gooey, and moist... the ideal chocolate cake really! I made this using a petite loaf pan (with a little bit leftover, which I separated into another muffin pan). I left the temp at 350 but cut the baking time to about 45 mins.  The little loafs turned out perfectly, and just the right size to serve as individual desserts for our guests.  I plated them straight from the oven while still piping hot, then added a generous scoop of ice cream on the side (we had sweet mint chocolate chip and english toffee caramel, both were delicious in combination with the cake).  Our friends devoured it!!  One additional note, I cut the oil down to 2/3 cup and used lowfat sour cream. I was a bit worried in the beginning because the batter seemed awfully spongy & goopy and not at all like typical cake batter consistency, but after whipping them out of the oven... they turned out beautifully! You will not regret making this recipe.

Insanely delicious! Moist, chocolatey (but not TOO too much!), and very pretty when baked in a Bundt pan. Incidentally, this recipe is the first I've used where the cake actually came out of the pan in one piece. I followed the rec's of other users to cut the oil, add a little milk, and use coffee instead of water. It's perfect. We used confectioner's sugar to sprinkle the top, but next time--and there will be a next time!--I'll try the glaze (just need some hot fudge topping). Excellent recipe. THANKS!!!! :0)

i have had this same recipe since i was a little girl, but we always made a hot chocolate sauce to pour over the cake before serving. the sauce is just 2 semi-sweet squares with 1/4c butter...melt together in saucepan and whisk in icing sugar until desired consistancy. mmmm the best thing about this delicious cake is it is so super easy to prepare

Pretty tastey. Very moist. I did as others suggested and cut the oil in half and used a half cup of apple sauce. I used bitter sweet chips instead to give my second cake more chocolate flavor. I also made a chocolate ganache for the filling and a chocolate glaze for the top.

So good! This is so easy and gets rave reviews every time I make it. I have found that it is best served warm with ice cream. It is very similar in flavor to some lava cakes we have had. I reduce the oil slightly, but that is the only change. So moist...yummy!!!!

I made this cake last night for my friend's birthday.  I only had a 9.5" round bundt pan but 55 minutes was the perfect amount.  It cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful.  Some reviews had recommended mini size chocolate chips, however I actually liked the regular size.  Would definitely make again.  Had it for breakfast this morning:)

Absolutely delicious.  Super moist.  I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and it was a big hit.  We all fought over the left-overs.  I took another reviewers advice and used 1/2 the oil and it was perfect, anymore oil and I don't see how the cake would have baked through.  I also baked it at 325 for about 55 min.  YUM!  We'll be having this again and again:)

I've made this recipe over and over again with great results every time. Super easy to make with a super great moist taste each time. This recipe also makes great cupcakes (24 good size ones). I didn't change a thing.

An AMAZING dessert! Love it. I have made it with a white chocolate glaze and served with strawberries with huge success! I have also served it plain and it is still just as awesome. Thanks for the great recipe Denise!

OH MY!!! This cake is spectacular. However, I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil - in place of a full cup of oil. I also used 1/2 cup of strong brewed coffee in place of the water. Nice and moist - No need for frosting!  I am glad I checked the cake after 45 minutes - it was done and an extra 10 minutes would have seriously over cooked it.

I made this cake for a dinner party I was having and followed the directions as stated except for a couple suggestions from other reviewers. I used the mini chocolate chips as well, but only used 3/4 of the bag, which was more than enough. I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe that someone else recommended as well and it got rave reviews! I will definitely make it again. Very easy but wonderful dessert!

So shocked at how this tasted considering all the great reviews.  Honestly nothing went wrong making it, it just tasted like a boxed chocolate cake. Nothing special what-so-ever. Very basic, nothing to rave about and certainly not worthy of winning any type of cooking competition!!  My guests seemed to enjoy it  but i won't be making it again.

I made this into individual cakes with my new rose-shaped cupcake pan.  Only took 37 minutes to cook them.  It is very rich...so rich that I added a raspberry glaze to the top for some acidity.  It was a bit hit at the housewarming party I attended.  Next time, I might substitute 1/2 c raspberry jam for 1/2 of the oil.  I also substituted mini choc chips for regular ones.  Definitely would recommend.

Very good, rich & chocolatey... made just as recipe is written. (except I baked it in 2 round 9 in. pans, as some of the other reviewers suggested). I usually make my cakes from scratch, but this was a good alternative. I used a dark chocolate cake mix (Duncan Hines) & topped it with a dark chocolate buttercream frosting... made it for my mom's 73rd. birthday & everyone loved it! It's quite rich & should satisfy any chocolate lovers taste for chocolate! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars as it's not a "from scratch" recipe (which is what I prefer).

I thought this was just ok. It tasted like a plain, store-bought chocolate cake made in a bundt pan. Not sure what I missed- so many others obviously loved it.

Beautiful cake for a dinner party!   Substituted strong coffee for the 1/2 cup of water and added a tsp each of vanilla and almond extract.   Drizzled the top with bittersweet and white chocolate swirled together and it looked and tasted like a fabulous bakery cake.

Excellent cake with variants. Try Fudge cake with chocolate pudding and chocolate chips, Caramel cake with butterscotch pudding and butterscotch chips, Cherry cake with vanilla pudding and cherry chips, or Fudge cake with chocolate pudding and peanut butter chips (VERY GOOD). You can also split the 2 layers, spread with Seedless Raspberry Preserves and then frost.

Fabulous cake and SO EASY to make!  And, I say that as someone who isn't much into baking.  It's also highly customizable, which I love!  Just trade out for different flavors of cake mix, pudding mix, and chips/morsels.  Works great with yellow cake, butterscotch pudding & butterscotch morsels.  Also with lemon cake, lemon pudding and white chocolate chips.  My favorite combinations so far are 1) spice cake mix, butterscotch pudding mix & (seasonal) pumpkin flavored chips and 2) chocolate cake mix, pistachio pudding mix, and mint flavored chips!  See?  FABULOUS! Just walk down the baking aisle and see which combos sound good together!

I hate to be a spoil sport on this cake... I really, really wanted to like it... but it just did not do it for me. I followed the directions to the t... the only thing I changed was subbing the water for coffee which is what I generally do in all of my chocolate cake recipes...and what I got was a cake with a somewhat crisp outside and and the inside was the consistency of a semi cooked brownie... I baked the cake in a bundt for only 50 mins as recommended by others and quickly removed it from the oven... and let it cool for an hour so it could easily slide out of the pan... It did that just fine.. but once placed on the cake plate the cake began to sag on one side... more than likely because of the chocolate chips/sour cream/oil mixture making it somewhat too moist. I will continue to use the Black Magic Cake Recipe from this site instead... But thank you for the recipe though. Happy Baking!

a good cake, but with all the excellent reviews i thought it would be more amazing. i used about 1 1/4 cups sour cream, only 1/2 cup oil, and a combo of mini-choc chips and reg choc chips. the reg size were better, since the mini ones just melted and i couldn't tell they were there at all. the cake was chocolately, but not that chocolatey. it was good enough to make again sometime. i didn't put on any frosting or anything but i think i will next time - to up the chocolatiness (is that a word?)

Followed directions to a T, but I don't know how you're supposed to stick a toothpick or something wooden in this cake and have it come out clean to tell if it's done due to all the melted chocolate chips. I baked for the longest time specified (55 mins) using a tube cake pan and once it started cooling the entire cake collapsed. At least the chunks of cake taste good. :/

I took the advice of alot of reviewers and substituted applesauce for olive oil, and low fat sourcream.  The taste was delicious, not too sweet, which is what my family likes. However, I found the texture to be extremely dense- almost like that of a brownie.  I was planning to make it into a 2 tiered, fondant-covered cake, and all the while I was crumb-coating, I felt like I was coating two big brownies!  When I make this recipe again, I will keep to a 13x9 pan, or a bundt pan. Otherwise, this was yummy!

This recipe is delicious just as Denise submitted it...obviously as it has over 2,000 good reviews and 58,000 people have saved it. Having made this numerous times, I make the following changes that my family seems to enjoy best.  I use a SMALL (3.9 oz.) box instant chocolate pudding, substitute 1/2 cup brewed coffee in place of water, & add only 1 cup mini chocolate chips. I also find that adding 1/2 tsp. vanilla & 1/4 tsp. almond extract helps eliminate the "cake Mix' taste. These changes seem to make it a little less "chocolately"..although it IS called Too Much Chocolate cake :)

I have tried a few cakes and they don’t often turn out very good. This one, well, it turned out perfect.  My friends absolutely loved it and couldn’t believe the taste!  Moist, perfect.  Followed  recipe exactly.  You have to try this one.

This is the Darn Good Chocolate Cake from one of the first Cake Mix Doctor books.  I've made it several times, and it's always good.  I prefer milk chocolate chips because they're sweeter and softer. Don't refrigerate the cake or the chips get hard.

Oh MY! Wonderful melt in your mouth heavenly cake! I had to tweak the recipe a little to accomodate what I had. I used about 1/3 c. sour cream, 2/3 c. plain greek yogurt, one 3.9oz pkg choc pudding mix, 3/4 c. oil and 2 c. mini chips as recommended. I used cupcake pans (more child friendly); baked at 350 for 23 minutes. Brilliant!

Don't make this if you don't like chocolate!! I made cupcakes with this recipe. I baked them for about 25 mins on 350 and it made a little over 24 of them. Yummy! :)

This cake is awesome! I had to change things a little bit based on what I had on hand. It was so good, I think next time I will stick to the changes I made. I used a triple chocolate fudge cake mix, a 3 oz box of chocolate pudding, only had two eggs- so replaced the other two with 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt, reduced water to 1/4 cup, and just added a handful of milk chocolate chips. Topped with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze", but that part wasn't great, next time will try a different glaze, one that is actually a glaze. Recipe purists will probably complain that this isn't even the same recipe, but I just wanted to share in case someone else was in a pinch and didn't have all the ingredients. A great cake... even though there is no such thing as "too much" chocolate!

I will not be making this cake again.  Granted, this cake is very fast and easy to make but still tastes like a box cake. I would rather spend more time making a cake from scratch.

This was a phenomenon cake recipe!  I was a little concerned when making it because it was very thick - there was no "pouring" it into the cake pans.  However, it came out beautifully.  It was rich and moist.  I used two 9 inch cake pans (done after 40 minutes).  While this may be chocolately enough on its own, my husband is a choco-holic, so I iced it with chocolate mousse (I used the chocolate mousse cake IV recipe on this website).  I cut each cake in half length-wise, and layered the mousse in between the four layers.  My husband and co-workers absolutely loved it.  This is going to be my go-to cake recipe for now on.

Wow!!! The first time I made this cake was when my younger brothers were home from college, and they polished off the whole thing in 1 day. I have made it 5 times since then, and it is always perfect. I have also made this with different flavors of cake and different chips. My family loved the coconut cake with vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips made from this recipe. I will make this cake whenever I need a delicious easy dessert!!

Just wanted to thank you for the recipe! I work at UPS and am the person who tries to bake for everyones birthdays. Made this for my girlfriend, covered it in the satin chocolate glaze and drizzled cream cheese frosting over it, then topped it with strawberries. Still remains the best cake I've ever made! TY TY TY

This is the most amazing cake! While I usually don't use cake mix to make a cake I was short on time for a get together and I used this recipe. All of my guests were impressed and there wasn't much left of the cake afterwards. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out super moist and delicious. I've made it a few times since and have always had great results. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other reviewers suggestions of different cake a pudding mixes. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Tried this "as is" for my birthday in February and was definitely not disappointed! Scrumptious from first to last bite. But there's more: I just snuck a small piece from the underside of a second cake I made after modifying this recipe, and it's just as good, even though it's not chocolate! I got the idea because St. Patrick's Day is tomorrow. I used an 18.25-oz. package of classic white cake mix and two small (3.4-oz) packages of pistachio instant pudding mix, and I omitted the chocolate chips entirely. What I got was a deliciously smooth, lightly pistachio-flavored cake, in a gorgeous light spring green color! It's terrific right now, while it's still warm in the bundt pan, but I think it's going to be even better after it cools ... I can't wait! Thanks for sharing this Denise! I will make this again and again and again. Update: The pistachio version was gone in two days, and just my hubby and I were eating it. Piggies, aren't we? LOL

I do think this is a great recipe, but I had to turn the oven down a little so it would bake evenly, and I prefer the mini chocolate morsels...they melt completely.

Love this cake.  I wanted to make a chocolate cake for my grandmother's birthday and had planned on making a homemade cake but also wanted something easy.  This was the best of both worlds.  I actually made cupcakes (350 for around 25 minutes) and topped them with "Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting" and my family couldn't get enough.  I used mini chocolate chips at the suggestion of another rater and that worked out wonderful.  This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe.  Thanks!

All I can say is AMAZING!  I took another reviewer's idea and used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.  My husband said it tasted like a big brownie with a hint of peanut butter.  I even made it slightly healthier by using reduced fat sour cream, two eggs and two egg whites, and applesauce instead of the vegetable oil.  It was incredibly rich and moist, will definitely be making this again.

I've made this several times.  What a fantastic and quick recipe to throw together.  This is a doctored cake mix but tastes like a completely homemade cake.  When I need a cake or cupcakes in a hurry, this is the recipe I turn to.  I pretty much follow the recipe to a "T" BUT, for a more intense chocolate flavor, replace that 1/2 cup warm water with a 1/2 cup strong coffee or even espresso.  That really brings it over the top.  I rarely bake this cake in a bundt or tube pan.  I usually make it in cupcake or layer cake pans. I have even baked this recipe in mini loaf pans.  It's wonderful with just powdered sugar sprinkled over it after baking, or with a rich chocolate glaze or ganache or with a silky chocolate frosting. But my favorite way is with a nice sweet white buttercream icing.  I bet it would be delicious with a peanut butter icing also.  One thing to mention though, after mixing all the ingredients together, sometimes my cake batter tends to look greasy (but not other times?? not sure why) but the cake always ends up perfect after baking it.

This receipe is so delicious. Mini chocolate chips work best because they don't sink to the bottom and they melt into every bite! To top off this cake.. I take a plastic container of chocolate frosting (can be Pillsbury, Betty Crocker, or any other frosting)-microwave for about one minute and pour over the cake while in the baking dish. So delicious. Tastes delicious while warm and with vanilla ice cream.

This cake is so tasty! It is a cross between a chocolate cake and a brownie, but better than both! Add a tsp of vanilla, and substituted 1/2 cup coffee for warm water, which brough out the chocolae flavor beautifully. Delicious!

I get so many compliments on this cake.  I put the ganache on top and I make a rasberry sauce using raspberries, lemon juice, sugar and water and drizzle it on the plate before I put the cake on the plate like a fancy restaurant might do prior to serving.  The raspberry chocolate combo is great!

SOOOOO good! very rich! this cake does NOT need icing, though. I frosted mine with buttercream and it was way too sweet for me. It would be perfect by itself. A friend told me it was the best chocolate cake they ever tasted.

So I started a new job and made this cake into cup cakes for a fundraiser event.  I added 1/2 white chocolate chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips but pretty much followed the directions to a tee.  For Halloween, I added a cute little spider by adding a junior mint on the top and used wilton black icing for the legs.  These were a hit at the fundraiser and the kids LOVED them!

This cake was amazing!  I made it exactly according to the directions and it was perfect.  I didn't use any kind of frosting or glaze and it was plenty sweet and chocolatey.  Just a dollop of whipped topping on each piece and it was great!

55 minutes is waaaaaay to long to be baking this cake..... in a 9x12 glass pan anyway. I'm not sure if it's correct for a bundt cake. I only put that sucker in for 45 mins and my cake was burned. All that oil also made it too oily. Boooo! Luckily, I bought extra ingredients just in case. Second time around, I baked for however long the box told me to, reduced the oil to 1/2 a cup, and perfection! Goes AMAZING with the German Chocolate Cake Frosting II from this site. The frosting and cake can still be warm when adding the frosting. BIG time saver!

I made this for a whole bunch of foodies at a gourmet-style BBQ for my hubby's work.  It was a MONSTER hit.  Apparently it was still getting compliments the next day at work.  Very moist and very elegant.  Perfect with coffee on a cool Autumn night in front of a fireplace...

Chocolate chips didn't melt, so if I ever make this again I would actually leave them out or use the mini chocolate chips.

I used to have a cake business and have made tons of cakes but this is the only chocolate cake that I make now.  It is fantastic.  Even though the recipe says to dust with powdered sugar (and you could just do that), don't be afraid to ice it.  I have made it with chocolate, vanilla and cream cheese frostings and I get RAVE reviews!

Excellent cake... although, don't do what I did and go overboard by adding the ganache recipe I found on here... way too much!  The powdered sugar suggestion (or, in our case, freshly whipped cream!) works GREAT. Consistency will be somewhat gelatinous due to the pudding, but don't be worried - it bakes up wonderfully!

Be careful this could give you a food-orgasm!!  Two thumbs waay up from everyone- I brought it to a party and some of the guests were disappointed bc it went too quickly for them to try it.  I especially love that it only called for one cup of sour cream (sometimes these recipes call for two).  Thanks Denise! =)

It TOTALLY lived up to its excellent rating on this site. Scrumptious cake!!! I just made the following modifications: Used 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk (instead of 1 cup oil), Added only 1.25 cup of chocolate chips, Used mini chips instead of regular size so they can melt easier. I used Pillsbury Super Moist cake mix (which already has a cup of pudding in it) with a 3.9 oz pack of pudding. I had to serve it the next day so microwaved the slices for 15 seconds and served with Vanilla icecream. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS! Thank you so much for the recipe! :)

I have been making this cake for different celebrations for a couple of years now.  My coworkers and friends always ask me to make "THAT chocolate cake" for their birthdays and for potlucks.  I always use half the amount of oil and 1/3 cup skim milk, and it turns out perfectly.  Thank you for this recipe; it got me to love baking again!

This recipe is absolutely amazing! Do not change anything. It is perfect the way it is. I use Pillsbury Devil's Food Cake Mix because it also has pudding in the mixture and I still add the package of pudding that the recipe calls for. The first time I made the cake, I was a little concerned at how thick the batter was, but the cake came out amazing. I also top with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe. I am required to bring this cake to work whenever it's someones birthday. Denise, thank you for such an amazing cake!

My husband and I have made this cake before.. but now with a new spin. We found a recipe for white chocolate glaze that we put on top of the cake as well. The cake is already awesome by itself but with the white chocolate and satiny chocolate glaze together... it is FANTASTIC! You can find how to make the white chocolate in the recipe titled 'Tyler's Raspberry Thumbprint with White Chocolate Glaze.' Give it a try! Mmm mmm!

Wow, what an easy cake to make. I followed the directions with no changes and it came out great! After it cooled I cut a small piece to taste, oh yeah, its was good. I am going to split the cake in half and put chocolate icing on half and powder sugar glaze on other half. This cake will let you add what ever you like, cant wait to experiment. Thanks for the recipe!

I usually don't use mixes to bake a cake, but the reviews were so good, I had to try it.  It was excellent.  I also frosted it with the coffee butter frosting as recommended by one reviewer and it was perfect.  It was a big hit with my husband, so needless to say, I will make this many times.

EXCELLENT!! I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and his parents. They never ask for a piece to take home, but they did this time. Only thing I added was the satiny chocolate glaze and strawberries in the middle of the bundt cake and around. It turned out amazing and delicious. Thank you for this recipe. It's a keeper.

This is just as good as everyone says it is. I am not a big chocolate cake eater but this cake is to die for. I took the advice to use mini chocolate chips and it came out perfectly. I've made it 2 times in the week I've had the recipe! Thank you so much for sharing.

In my opinion this cake was too sweet. I think it should have less chocolate. I did not care for this recipe. It would have tasted better if there was less chocolate.

This basic recipe works in other flavors as well! Try lemon cake mix with lemon pudding and white choc chips, white cake with vanilla pudding and chips, endless possibilities. Chocolate fudge cake mix with choclate fudge pudding and dark chocolate chips is superb! This recipe is almost exactly the same as one from the Kraft site, I usually cut the oil to 3/4 cup. I decorate cakes and I always use this recipe because it is easy to do in 2 round pans, 9x13, tube pan (increase cooking time), or cupcakes. It is nice and moist but still on the heavy side so it's easy to frost and holds together well when layered and sliced, doesn't crumble like some scratch cakes do. Freezes well, I have several in my freezer waiting to be decorated...

Despite the fact that this is one of THE most celebrated recipes on this site, I can't bring myself to give this any more than a 3.  Let me start off by saying that I'm not that much of a cake lover so maybe I'm biased.  But with all the 5-star reviews, I had to try this.  I should have gotten my first warning by the fact that the base of this cake comes from a box.  Sorry, but add all the extras you want, this is nothing more than a dressed up Betty Crocker/Duncan Hines, whatever and it tastes like it.  There was nothing special about it, I didn't feel the sour cream or extra oil added much density to it.  Maybe I should have used two eggs and two egg yolks, not sure but I've tasted 5-star cakes before and this is not one.  If I ordered this in a restaurant, I'd consider it a waste of money.  Because this is a cake mix cake, it's lacking in any real chocolate flavor.  To be honest, there was no depth of flavor at all.  I would definitely recommend using mini chocolate chips.  The regular-sized ones don't sink as someone else suggested but texturally, I think mini chips would work better.  I thought for all the fat in the cake, it lacked moistness and density that I was expecting.  Sorry but won't be making this again.

This cake is awesome! I made it exactly as the recipe states. I used regular chocolate chips, not mini ones as someone else suggested and they did not sink to the bottom of the cake at all. In fact, when the cake cooled completely, you get soft chocolate chips with every bit! It was a huge hit with our guests for our daughter's birthday. I made a glaze to top it off, and it was fantastic and didn't add all that much sweetness. If you want the perfect chocolate cake glaze, follow this: 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 3 Tbsp butter, 1 Tbsp light corn syrup, and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Cook in microwave for 1 minute and then stir until nice and smooth. Spoon over cake.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS.  I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake, but I made it for company and everyone had two slices and went home with some too!  SO good and incredibly easy.  I didn't have as much sour cream as I needed so I used 1/3 sour cream and 2/3 plain (whole fat) yogurt - turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make this again.

I just made this - VERY GOOD! I made cupcakes for my sons 5th birthday. I was told they are the best cupcakes ever. I used 3 eggs instead of 4 because I had Jumbo eggs. It made 24 cupcakes - I baked at 350 degrees for 22 minutes. This is a very thick batter and rises very well. I filled my cupcake liners about 2/3 full and they swelled over the edge like gourmet muffins - a little too much for me - next time I will use less. However - the taste is awesome. Definitely a keeper!

This was tasty and moist... I used kahlua instead of water to add a little more depth to the flavor- this was good, and next time I'll try coffee.  I used mini chips which I'd highly recommend since they don't sink like full-size chips can, and they get more distributed.  I made cupcakes (about 32) and baked for about 18 minutes.  I frosted with the creamy chocolate frosting recipe on this site- and the combination worked well.  I was a little disappointed today (day after) that the cupcakes aren't more moist, but I may have baked them a minute too long- it's so important not to overbake stuff.  Still, very tasty and will keep this recipe around!

Delicious!  It is super chocolatey but very delicious.  I made the recipe exactly as written and then poured a raspberry puree over the top.  It was a hit!

I went to college for Pastry Arts and I made this cake for my daughter's birthday just wanting something new to try. I have to say, this is by far one of the best chocolate cakes I have had to date. Now, I only used 1/2 c. veggie oil, a 4.5 oz. box of choc. pudding mix and white mini chips instead of chocolate. I also put it in 2- 9 inch rounds and baked until I saw they were done....I also frosted with homemade cream cheese butter cream. YUMMO! RECOMMENDATION: When you have everything in the bowl (minus chips) beat on high for 3 minutes. This creates a nice fluffy cake.

I had previously made the Double Chocolate Brownie Cake from this site which is very similar(uses 1/2 oil and 3.9 oz pudding) and found that the results were much better. I would suggest using 1/2 cup of oil in this recipe to obtain delicious results! It's amazing how an extra 1/2 of oil can make such a big difference in the outcome.

This cake looked a little intimidating at first but it was a cinch!  i used the mini chips and it made the cake much moister because the melt more.  i baked a 4 layer 12in round bday cake with this recipe and it was a complete hit!! Thanks!

SUPER!! I made this for my dad's 60th suprise party.  Everyone loved it! I made the suggested changes: add 1/3 c. milk, only 1 1/4 c. of semi-sweet chips, and baked at 335 for 55 minutes.

excellent! I made this as a two layer round cake and used whiped cream cheese frosting from this site and plenty of strawberries. First time I followed recipe, second time made a few changes:
Replace water with warm coffee or warm black tea. 
instead of one cup oil use 2/3 cup
use 1 and 1/4 cup sour cream
add 1/4 cup of milk
use mini choc.chips and reduce to 1 cup
Brought this to a social event it was gone in minutes. Everyone kept saying "now that's a cake!!" Great as is and amazing with above changes.

I made this cake once as directed (it was fabulous) and again for a friend who loves white chocolate...I use vanilla cake mix, white chocolate pudding mix and white chocolate chips.  I made it in a bundt pan and topped with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" (substituting white chocolate)...WOW WOW WOW. I gave away the recipe to everyone at the party.

I made these as cupcakes & they turned out great!  I didn't change anything in the recipe & baked for about 17 mins. 
I made them w/ a chocolate buttercream icing from this site -- and have to say that they were better w/ just a dusting of powdered sugar.  
My oldest son had 3 - THREE!!! - of these & would have had a fourth if I had let him...and he doesn't even really like sweets!

I loved this recipe!  I made it exactly as listed and used the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site.  I decorated with mini chocolate chips and chocolate-covered espresso beans.  People from work thought this was a bakery cake!

I've made this cake for many different occasions and it's always a crowd pleaser. This cake is so moist, frosting is not necessary.  A sprinkling of powdered sugar is all you need. 
Variations:  Chocolate Caramel Pudding Mix and Caramel/Chocolate Chips
Peanut Butter Chips
Be creative and have fun.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.

About once a month, I like to bake a treat for our Police Department, and this recipe was perfect for my new mini-bundt cake pans! These were a major hit!

I followed the recipe exactly, except for the baking time ... 18 minutes at 350. Recipe made 24 perfect mini-bundt cakes. Just sprinkled on confectioner's sugar. Wow!

Followed the recipe exactly! It was as great as all of the other reviewers said. Easy to make too! I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and it was delicious! I used regular choc chips and floured them so that they wouldn't sink--some people said try the mini chips; I think that I'll try that next time! My hubby, chocolate cake lover, loved this cake, and he doesn't usually say that he loves stuff!! :)

I personally do not care for chocolate cake of any kind, but OMG, this is great!  I made this for the BF's b-day and it was a hit!  He asked next time go without frosting b/c the cake itself was so tasty.
I followed the lower fat suggestions of light sour cream, 1/2c milk and 1/2 oil.  I topped it with the chocolate cheese frosting.  I also cooked it in two 5" springforms at 350 for 45 minutes and they turned out perfect.  There was leftover batter, so I made 6 cupcakes too.
I will absolutely be making this again!

No 6 stars? MMMMMM. Followed the 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk substituted for the 1 cup oil.  The mixture looked thin, but worked great.  I had to underfill the cupcake tins to keep the top reasonable enough to smear a glob of lovely frosting on top.  Dropped strawberries and raspberries and M&M, you name it.  Made 2 dozen cupcakes and 2 dozen mini-muffins.

After reading all of the reviews I knew I had to try this recipe. Chocolate can never be bad!!! I am a die hard chocoholic, I love to bake, especially desserts, so this recipe seemed made for me.
The cake was very moist and had a wonderfully decadent texture to it. It looked perfect, tasted good, but like some reviewers, there wasn't a wow factor. It is a good recipe for a boxed cake mix, but those who make their cakes from scratch will know that you can definitely taste the difference between the processed cake mix and that of a scratch batch. I still enjoyed the final product, as did my family, but they are spoiled and prefer home made treats. All in all, it was just a dressed up cake mix.

Excellent doctored cake mix recipe.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and next time would definitely use mini ones.  The regular sized ones were just too much chocolate overload.  But the cake was moist and delicious and a perfect consistency.  This one's a keeper!

Absolutely phenomenal chocolate cake. I am in love with this recipe. I've made this twice - first time I followed the recipe except I used mini morsels per the other reviewers suggestions. The second time I used regular chocalte chips, german chocolate cake mix, and didn't have enough sour cream so I replaced half of it with plain yogurt. Still phenomenal.

I made this cake for Easter hoping it would be extra special based on all the great reviews.  While it's not horrible (it looked beautiful and tasted fine, I also made a glaze for the top) it is also nothing special. It definitely tastes just like what it is - a doctored up cake mix recipe. I much prefer cakes made from scratch rather then using a boxed mix. I still give it 4 stars though since I don't believe it should be compared to a cake made from scratch. It is what it is but I won't be making this again.

I made this for my Mother's Birthday and it was a HUGE hit.  After spray buttering the bundt pan, I lightly coated it with unsweetened cocoa to make it a little less sweet.  I also make a chocolate ganache to coat it with and decorated it with a mix of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries and strawberries.  Everyone thought it was the best cake ever.

OK... OK... I give up! This IS thee best chocolate cake. The ingredients didn't seem that out of the ordinary, but with all the rave reviews I had to try it.  OK... Uncle!  I used the mini-chips, too and that worked really well.  I will now use this recipe for ALL my cakes.

This cake was decent, but not nearly as sublime as the reviews made it out to be.  We ate it, and it tasted fine, but it didn't make anyone jump up and down.  I tried serving it with the satiny chocolate glaze, cool whip, fresh raspberries, and several glasses of milk (which you'll definitely need if you eat this).  All things considered, I don't think I'll make it again.

I made this cake last night for my husbands birthday, my sister had made it before so I was prepared for how delicious it would be.  I served it about an hour after it came out of the oven, and it was still warm and the chips were still melted.  I am a frosting person, but I absolutely love this cake and I don't think it needs any additional topping, unless you want it for decoration purposes.  I would like to try it with strawberries sometime.

I was so excited to try this recipe - especially with all the great reviews.  I was greatly disappointed with the results.  The recipe was very easy and the texture of the cake was wonderful as well, but it truly tastes like a "doctored boxed cake mix"!!!!  I'm going to try adding coffee instead of water and top the cake with ganache - like others have suggested.  Not a bad cake, but definitely not over the top flavor.

Followed the recipe except with half as much oil and a third cup of milk as suggested by another reviewer. I made it into a two layer cake with 9-inch pans (340 degrees, somwhere around 45 minutes) and covered it with Special Buttercream Frosting (recipe from this site :) ). The cake was great, delicious, rich, and chocolately; everyone loved it! However, I have to agree with another reviewer, it just tasted like a slightly enhanced cake mix with chocolate chips. The chocolate chips were really the source of the rich chocolately taste; the cake itself was more of a "supporting" taste but it complemented the chocolate really well :) Thanks again!

This cake was great.  So easy to make and sooooo moist.  Took it to a dinner party and got rave compliments.  Topped with Satiny Glaze and sugared raspberries for a beautiful look.

This recipe was amazing! I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and we all loved it. It is extremely rich and dense, but that allows for a wonderful indulgence factor. The cake turned out impeccably lovely. I wish I had taken a picture, but it was gone before I had the chance. I used the Silken Chocolate Glaze recipe and garnished with strawberries. It looked and tasted perfect. I am so pleased and I suggest everyone try this great recipe. Simple, beautiful, and delicious!

WOW!  I could not stop eating this cake.  I actually melted some buttercream icing and poured some on top, but I think next time I will make it with no icing because it is so good it needs nothing on top.

I made this for one of our tailgates recently. I followed the recipe exactly without any additions or alterations. Everyone raved and had to take home some of the leftovers! I've had several of our fellow tailgaters ask for the recipe as well. This is The best chocolate cake recipe I've ever tried! Thanks so much for posting.

This is truly for chocolate lovers only. I couldn't wait until it cooled, so we had a slice while it was still hot.  It was OK hot, but very good after it cooled.  I think I'll use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips next time.

Made this cake for my son's birthday, and all I can say is WOW!  No wonder it won a ribbon at the county fair!  I did leave out the chocolate chips, as my son is a "purist" when it comes to his cake (no nuts, chocolate chips or anything chunky at all).  I made it in two 9 inch cake pans, and layered with milk chocolate frosting.  Do NOT make this mistake, as it was too sweet in my opinion.  This cake stands alone, and does not need the "extra" sweetness from the frosting.  That having been said, it was the most moist chocolate cake I have ever made.  In two days, the entire cake was devoured by my sons.  They are already asking for another one!    Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I took another review advice and add 1/2 cup of bourbon and the walnuts to the bottom my pan. I only use 1 cup of chocolate chips becuase that's all I had on hand. Will definitely make this cake again!

Wow, they're not joking when they say there's a lot of chocolate! I even put chocolate frosting on it... I think the cake was excellent, and the only thing I'll do differently next time is leave out the chocolate chips. I felt like with the frosting (with any frosting, really) the chocolate chips don't fit in right. I think I might try this recipe again, doing everything the same, except omiting the chocolate chips and putting in a can of cherry pie filling instead, so it could be like a cherry fudge cake.

My family loved this cake!  Small slices will do, as it is very rich.  I used only 3/4 c. of oil and it was still very moist.  I also used just 1 c. of miniature chocolate chips.  It was just delicious.  No need for the powdered sugar as it is very sweet without it.

This recipe turned out pretty well.  I followed the amounts in the recipe and it was a very moist cake.  It's not a very sweet cake though.  It is more of a rich chocolate flavor.  I used the powdered sugar and added whole strawberries in the center and sliced ones all around the edge of the cake.  I think that definitely added to the flavor and also made an impressive presentation.  I took it to a meeting of our church ladies' group and everyone loved it.  Several people asked for the recipe.

I had made this recipe before and love it.  Today I made it with Red Velvet Cake Mix and it was great.  I substituted the oil with applesauce and used mini chips.  I will take along several copies of the recipes.  Thanks for sharing.

I've been using this recipe for years now and I love it!  This is a rich cake, but,as far as I am concerned, you can never have a dessert that is "too rich"

This was an excellent chocolate cake and very easy to make.  I am very busy and don't have time to make anything from scratch - so this cake was perfect.  I have made it several times and EVERYONE just raves.  In fact, I am printing off a copy for the neighbor right now.

This is the same recipe my family has made many times under the name "Better Than Sex Cake".  I have also made a yellow version that is also excellent. I'm sure there are better made from scratch recipes out there, but this is a great cake from boxed mix.

Made this today for the first time & it is wonderful.  As suggested by the instructions with my bundt pan, I lowered the temperature 25 degrees & baked it 55-60 minutes.  Cooled it completely as suggested & it came out beautifully.  Sifted powdered sugar on top & even my frosting loving husband said it was perfect with just the p. sugar.  This is a keeper!

I can see why you won a prize for this Denise!  It turned out absolutely perfect.  It is rich and moist and decadent!  I'm not much of a baker but thanks to you I can bake this cake with confidence!  So easy to make but tastes like it took all day.  Absolutely sinful!

Oh my goodness.  A friend told me he had never tried bundt cake, so I decided to make him one as a just-because present.  I came here to find a recipe, stumbled on this one, and wasn't expecting much.  The second the batter was stirred, I knew it was a winner.  I put some extra batter into cupcake cups, and they were melt-in-your-mouth moist and superchocolatey.  The cake, once cooled, came out of the pan perfectly -- no crumbling! -- and after his first bite, my friend became an insant bundt cake addict.  Same here!  Easy recipe, wonderful results ... this is my new gift of choice!

I made this recipe in Wilton Mini Shell pan (has six small shells that look like seashells)  of course I had to adjust the baking time to 20 minutes per batch.  I also used mini chocolate chips instead of regular size....it turned out wonderful and it made about 24 shells!!!  What a hit and they turned out beautil with the powdered sugar.   Thanks,  Ginger

I’ve made this cake more times than I can count, and it’s always a hit. I follow the directions as is, and It’s awesome and it’s also fun to play around with. I’ve made a butterscotch version, which is a favorite in my house, and also lemon, chocolate peanut butter, and a great white chocolate strawberry, and the original recipe adding Andes chocolate mint pieces. Just change the chips, pudding and cake mix flavors and they all seem to turn out wonderfully. Can’t miss on this one!

First time making a bundt  cake. It came out perfect. Family loved it. My wife was surprised that the top of the cake didn't stick to the pan so make sure you follow the directions for greasing and cooling. I'm making this again for the holidays.

The absolute best chocolate cake ever. Hands down. I have made it many times for gatherings and every single time I am asked for the recipe. I never even frost it, it doesn't need it. I dust it with powdered sugar. The best! No adjustments needed, either. Fail safe.

Chocolate goodness! I have to admit I was hesitant to use a box cake mix but the results were amazing. The cake was rich, moist, easy, quick and very chocolatey.  I made this for my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved it. Everyone was asking me what recipe I used and raved about the taste. I used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips instead of 2 cups and out of purely not reading the recipe correctly I ended up using 2 -(2oz) boxes of instant pudding mix instead of a large box (which I did not have). I baked the cake in a greased metal 9x13" pan for 33 minutes and iced the cake with buttercream frosting (from AR).  A must make again!

This is fantastic because it can be applied to ANY cake mix, not just chocolate, and it will come out pretty darn close to perfect.  The best part is, with some really good frosting, homemade of course, I can do anything with this recipe!

I have made this cake (and a bunch of other bundt cakes that use box cake mix) a few times and while I always thought they tasted good they weren't great.  Then I took a look at the cake mixes and all of them in my grocery store in NYC were 15.25 oz not 18.25.  So I used my new handy dandy digital scale and redid the math (never my strong suit but my son helped) and holy moly the cake came out perfect!  So be sure to look at the cake mix's net weight and change the amounts accordingly.

My grandmother made this cake for my mother  and her siblings when she was a child. Then, my mom made it for me and mine. Now, 20 years later, my siblings and I still make this cake for special events and holidays. My cousin specifically asked for us to make this cake as his grooms cake at his wedding! There are a couple different things that go into my grandma's recipe (that I won't disclose) but all in all, it's an amazing cake and easy recipe. Little tip: flip your cake right after it comes out of the oven. If you don't, the cake has a tendency to stick and because it's so moist, it'll break apart.

I have made this before and loved it. I just made it again for a bridal shower (cupcakes - 20 minutes to cook) but this time, I only had 1 small box of pudding and light sour cream and just 3/4 cup of oil (I'd already been to the store twice and just was not going to go again). It didn't matter they still came out great! Update: How about this: I made my grand daughter a birthday cake using this recipe. All the family gathered to watch her blow out the candles and have an obligatory piece of cake (many birthdays in a few months time period you see). Most times much cake is left over at these events. HOWEVER not so with this cake, they couldn't stop eating it, they went back for more and it was GONE by the end of the party.

Excellent, easy-to-make cake.  I believe I now know why the other reviewer's comments vary about whether to use 1 cup of oil versus only 3/4 cups of oil.  Not all cake mixes are 18.25 ounces.  The cake mix I used was 16.5 ounces, so I used only 3/4 cups of oil (I left everything else the same).  So, in my opinion, let the size of your cake mix determine how much oil to use.  I ended up cooking it for 60 minutes (bundt pan) and it was incredibly moist and done to perfection.

This year I decided to bake my own birthday cake.  I searched for a recipe for a dense, chocolately decadent cake, yet easy to make.  This recipe was a real WINNER! It came through in all ways, my husband I really enjoyed it.  Best of all I loved reading all the reviews, some of them where hilarious! And a lot of them offered great ideas on changing up the combo of flavours, while using the same basic concepts.  Must say - I don't think it's fair to change a recipe, then criticize the outcome...enough said on that ??!  Only thing I was concerned about was the length of time baking, my oven is convection which gets really hot, and we live at a higher altitude, so I tend to watch the temp and time carefully.  I think everyone's oven has its own "personality", which is reflected in a lot of the reviews.  So, If  you are looking for a scrumptious, easy and quick to assemble recipe for a dense chocolate cake this is the one for you,  Bon Appetit!

I made this cake a couple years ago and the flood gates opened! Everyone I know requests it for birthdays, anniversaries and "just because".  The recipe is way easy and comes out perfect every single time.  I use the mini chips as others suggest and the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site in every cake I make. Otherwise, I use raspberries or strawberries or chocolate sprinkles to decorate ... or nothing at all!  GREAT Recipe!!

I've made this cake many times and the only difference is I use ALL milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.

I prepare it the day before an event and I think it tastes better that way.  I also buy a container of chocolate frosting and microwave it for 30 seconds.  I drizzle the frosting (lightly) on the cake and serve.

I have made this cake 4 times now. 3 times just within the last week. It is by far the best chocolate cake that I have ever made. I know the recipe by heart now. My I have made it to take to work twice now and after the first time, my co-workers have put a sign on the door by my desk that "Ina is the bestest chocolate cake maker ever". LoL. I have made it with the chocolate satiny glaze and without. Either way you can't go wrong. I love it best when it is still warm with a scoop of ice cream on it.

This cake was everything it promised to be! I followed the receipe exactly except for the following modifications:

1) I used only 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, because I was afraid 2 cups would overwhelm the flavor of the cake. In my opinion, 1 cup is all you need! 

2) I wanted a more "grown-up" cake, so I substituted the 1/2 cup of water with 1/2 cup of Buffalo Trace Bourdon Cream. It turned out with the perfect overtone of the bourdon cream! I can easily imagine you could replace the water with whiskey, Irish cream, Guinness, ect. 

3) I used Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge Cake Mix instead of Devil Food. Holy cow it's good!

I made this for a family party and it was a huge hit. I made recipe exactly as written and loved moistness and rich chocolate taste of this cake. This will be my go to chocolate cake recipe.

I made this cake for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day! I used a heart shaped pan and Nutella frosting, it was delicious. And it was almost too much chocolate! Warning: for extreme chocolate lovers only!

I'm not really a chocolate fan but, my husband is. I made this cake for his birthday and he LOVED it. I must say it was very moist and the name says it all. It was to much chocolate for me but he LOVED it and that's all  that mattered.

I made this cake for the Super Bowl and then the following week for the folks at work.  Delicious!!!  Everyone raved about it.  It was so simple to make and I followed the recipe as written.  Instead of frosting or powdered sugar, I drizzled chocolate syrup over the top.

Made this for Super Bowl Sunday.  WOW! I've never made such a moist cake.  Made it exactly by recipe, except I didn't bother to dust with powdered sugar, or top with anything. It didn't need it.  It was a big hit!  As I'm a believer that you cannot have "too much" chocolate, I'll have to rename it!

This cake is sooo good. I've made it a few times and find it pretty forgiving. I used a cake with "pudding in the mix" so didn't add it the first time and it came out great. This time I added it, it just finished, hope its as good. My cooking time was significantly less, only took 30 minutes and a knife came out spotless. I recall last time was less too. So keep an eye on it! Topped it with satiny chocolate icing and it was too die for! That is a staple in my kitchen and will use it for everything!

I rarely take the time to rate recipes, but I've been using this for years and it's ALWAYS a winner. Best results for the least amount of time/effort when you're in a crunch. I also use coffee for water and mini-chips, but I'm sure it's great as-is. I have made this as cupcakes (~30min) and mini cupcakes (~22mins), birthday cakes, mini-loaves, etc. Recipe doubles and triples wonderfully. Cream cheese icing works well if you want to decorate. The ONLY downside is I can't share the recipe--it would ruin my street cred to see boxed mix ingredients. :)

There was a last minute request for anything chocolate from my office staff after looking at the deserts coming to our Christmas pot luck. Love fudge this time of year but that is not to creative so I decided to bake a cake for the holidays and ALL CHOCOLATE. Well, this cake was not only a hit by taste but most people did not want to be the first to cut into this wreath because of the simple but festive decoration. In the end, it was just what everyone wanted and thank you Denise for the help in getting there. Great recipe AND fun to do with that powdered sugar, mint leaves and raspberries. Merry Christmas everyone!

I made this in a 9x9 square pan.. Mistake! I don't have a bundt cake pan but next time I will use a bigger pan. Took about 2 hours to cook all the way through because of my small pan and then the edges were kind crispy :) super delicious though

This is so fantastic!  I followed the recipe, using mini-chocolate chips as so many suggested.  This was part of my daughter's birthday cake, and I found it easy to frost and decorate.  When I was mixing the batter, it had this interesting, blob-like consistency that made it so easy to pour.  It rose beautifully in the oven, too.  Because this was for a birthday, I didn't use a bundt cake pan, but rather 2 8x8 square pans.  This cake is moist and chocolatey, and definitely a go-to recipe!

Love this cake.  I have altered the recipe various different ways depending on who I'm baking for and what is their favorite.  As I don't have a bundt pan I make two rounds.  they seem to cook just fine.  The basic recipe stays the same but I change the pudding, what I put in for filling between layers( the favorite I raspberry pie filling) and the frosting.  today I am using oreo pudding and cookies and crème frosting.  Yum!!!

I was unsure of using a cake mix at first, but in the end I never would have known.

Just baked it now. I tried a mini muffin version. It was a tedious job... but worth it. I used a teaspoon to fill up the muffin tins. Baked it for 12 mins. I didn't use 1 cup of oil. Just 1/2 then 1/3 milk. As for the warm water. I replaced it with warm instant coffee.

This is the best bundt cake known to any man, woman or child. You can use any combo of pudding mix and cake and it turns out great. As others mentioned using stalling chocolate chips is best. You will not be disappointed!

I made this for some chocolate lovers and they ate all of it! Batter was very thick so I got worried that I messed up the recipe and double checked everything I did, but it was right. Came out very good.

This is my "go to" chocolate cake recipe. I have made it more than 2 dozen times as written.... this is the cake my family (kids, parents, husband, in-laws, friends) want for their birthday. No more store bought cakes for us. This feels special and is SO delicious with chocolate ganache on top. (Melt choc. chips, add cream, a touch of vanilla...stir unit smooth and then pour over cake). I usually use my bundt pan. I usually make homemade vanilla bean ice cream to go with it. Today I am trying rounds, for a tall multi-layer cake for my daughters birthday.

I used to be a "bake from scratch" baker.... or buy it from the store, but this recipe has made making an impressive dessert easy and fast.... and has changed my mind about using cake mixes as a base.

I have made this cake by request for many of my co workers birthdays. I use mini chocolate chips, coco powder to dust and milk and dark chocolate for the frosting. I melt it a little and do a base then a drizzle of the two for a nice presentation. thank you for a wonderful cake recipe!

As the name suggest, it was way too much chocolate for my taste. The kids noted it was also too sweet. One good thing about it is that it was a cinch to prepare especially if your are pressed for time and you need something for a potluck or party. Otherwise, I'll be sticking to the One Bowl Chocolate from this same site  as my ultimate recipe.

I've made this recipe a zillion times and it is always a hit. I've done it as a bundt cake, as a layer cake and as cupcakes, sometimes with frosting, sometimes with a glaze, sometimes with a dusting of powdered sugar. I topped it with a chocolate almond frosting and won 2nd place at the TN state fair. In response to those who have  complained that their's came out too dry or that baking it at 350 makes the outside "crunchy", I would strongly suggest that you make this cake at least a day before you plan to serve it. In fact, I don't even frost it until the next day. Once it has cooled I either wrap it in plastic or put it into a gallon size ZipLock bag to set overnight. Much like quick breads and muffins, it becomes more moist overtime.

This recipe kind of sounds like a heart attack on a stick....How about substituting the oil for applesauce that makes it moist as well. Will try it like that...

I just made this-according to directions- even though the 2c chocolate chips seemed like too much and I could find a 15.25oz box of cake. This was so unbelievably easy! With the amount of oil it did not stick to the bowl and poured very easily into the pam-sprayed bunt pan. Baked about 45 min. Couple hours later it slipped easily out of the pan onto a plate and I dusted with powdered sugar. Looked great! A+ for ease! 
I brought this into work and I think everyone had a slice. People said it was good, but no one really raved about it, or asked for the recipe, like they do when they love it. I personally thought it was too rich. I won’t make again. I would rather have just a lighter plain devil’s food cake.

Wow! This is super decadent chocolate cake! It was really easy to make and easier to eat! I followed the recipe exactly (except used mini chocolate chips). I loved the way it got kind of crispy on the outside and the inside was velvety and rich. I made the satiny chocolate glaze as other reviewers have. It made the cake a little over the top sweet but still tastes incredible!

Excellent cake. I used a chocolate fudge cake mix (that's what I had in the pantry) and mini chocolate chips. Turned out perfect.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly. I had to make a few substitutions. Instead of sour cream, I used cream cheese. Instead of one large (6-8 serving) packet of chocolate pudding powder, I used 1 (4 serving) packet of Almond Joy pudding powder and 1 (4 serving)white chocolate pudding powder. The batter was very thick, but the cake came out great! It was very moist and delicious! I got lots of compliments! I served with strawberries and ice cream and no frosting. It was great!

This is an outstanding, quick cake recipe that requires no icing. I used chocolate fudge cake mix, reduced fat sour cream, sugar free butterscotch pudding mix and 1 c. Butterscotch chips. The cake turned out moist and decadent.

I make this exactly like the recipe, unless I use 2 9" round pans or make cupcakes, then I use frosting(I am going to try the Chocolate Glaze recipe from this website that some comments mention).I usually need to let it bake just a bit longer than the recipe says. 

I have also used this recipe and replaced it with white cake and vanilla pudding - also excellent. 

I get so many compliments from this recipe, I will probably never use a different recipe, not for chocolate or white cake anyway. My friends will say things like "Wow! That is the best chocolate cake I have ever had! You have to give me the recipe!" I just snicker because it is also so easy to make. I put a 9" layered cake in a cake box I bought at the store for a couple of dollars and my friends brother made a bet with her that I bought the cake from a bakery!

Wow! Delicious and moist! Everyone loved it. I changed a few things. Poured half of the mixture in the bundt pan and added a layer of kitkat bites then poured the rest of the mixture on top. When it cooled down I added the chocolate sauce on top as well as a caramel sauce made from scratch and kitkat bites on top of the cake! It looked really good with the caramel added to it!

I made two of these for memorial Day parties, and everyone loved them! Like some other reviewers I used half the amount of chocolate chips in the cake, but everything else was the same. I didn't feel like making frosting so I just used the store bought stuff. Just heat it 10-20sec in the microwave and pout it over the bundt cake to glaze. Delicious!

This is by far the BEST chocolate cake recipe ever! I get tons of compliments when I serve it. Perfect for potlucks! I have even made cupcakes out of this recipe and they were wonderful. Be warned that it is a very dense cake. It pairs fabulously with the satiny chocolate glaze also found on this website. This recipe is simply incredible. It never disappoints!

Yummm. I made this as is except used mini chocolate chips, and it was perfectly delicious. I did end up baking it for about 58 minutes for a toothpick to come out clean in the center or the crack of the cake. But, it ended up having a nice crispy outside that was a good contrast to the beautifully moist inside.  I covered it with a chocolate ganache icing and sprinkled some more chocolate chips on top as well as powdered sugar.  Everyone loved it! Thanks for a great recipe.

this is a moist, delicious cake which doesn't taste like it's from a mix. (I use Betty Crocker - no funny aftertaste), and substitute brewed coffee for the water. I also leave out the chocolate chips. I bake it in a large pan- about 17 x 13, until it's just done. Once out of the oven, I immediately take a skewer and poke holes into the top of the cake - all over it, then spread a thin coat of warm chocolate glaze (made with butter, cocoa and powdered sugar). keep spreading so it drips down into the cake, keeping it super moist. I wait a while, then add the remaining glaze/frosting. sometimes I top with roasted, chopped pecans or walnuts while the glaze is still warm.

It tastes like a box cake.  I'm a terrible snob about baking and think they have to be made from scratch.

Made exactly per the recipe. Absolutely awesome - and I am a chocoholic.  Frosted with the Chocolate Ganache recipe on this site made with Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet chips - which I think added the perfect addition of not too sweet frosting.  Sprinkled with mini choc chips and toffee bits.  Will definitely make again.

My husband had the guys over for dinner and basketball. This was a hit. Cut the oil to 3/4. It was so moist and delish. One of the guys asked if I could give the recipe to his girl. Will def make again.

I made this cake as written with ONE exception. I used strong coffee instead of water. AAAAMAZING!!!!! I was concerned with the amount of oil but it was sooo moist and delicious. I think 3/4c oil would be enough tho. I hand mixed until blended added the mini semi sweet chips and baked for 50 mins. I topped it with the chocolate ganache on this site. YUM!!!!! My new go to recipe. Thanks

Thank you Denise for this awesome, easy recipe!  I made two bundt cakes using this recipe for my daughter's third birthday, cutting and shaping the cakes into the number three.  It turned out fabulous! I will say though, I used store bought icing to save time to top it, and I actually think the cake tastes much better without any icing at all (or probably with higher quality icing or just a dusting of powdered sugar).  I did make a couple slight changes, I only used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, and I decreased the chocolate chips to around 1 to 1 1/4 cups of mini chips.  This will be my go to cake recipe from now on, and it helped my first attempt at baking my children's birthday cakes a huge success!

I originally made this for some friends but after we did some yard work we came back VERY HUNGRY and attacked this cake. We EACH wolfed down 2 slices along w/ice cream. I used a bundt pan & followed the recipe. The flavor is very good & it's moist. For the frosting I heated up prepared frosting & drizzled it over to cover any boo boos then added some more. This is quick & a keeper. Thank you for sharing

Been using this recipe for years with one tiny change: milk instead of water. I always get raves for it and I thought it was funny to find the same cake recipe on here. Give it a shot! You'll love it. :)

This cake was a huge hit at a potluck I attended. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil and mini chocolate chips for regular-sized chips, and I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze (from this site). It was so chocolately and moist!

It's great. I followed the recipe and the chocolate chips didn't melt all the way just like the cake decorator said in her review. I'm making it again, and this time with mini choc-chips.

Too much is right - like eating a candy bar. A little too moist for my liking so I'll halve the oil next time and cut the Chocho chips.

I was not sure how this recipe was going to turn out because I read all the different responses to the reviews. But let me tell you the only thing I did different was use half a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips cause I did not buy a big enough bag. My cake turn out absolutely delicious. Please just follow the recipe and you will be very pleased. I give this recipe 5 stars!!!!!!!

I followed this recipe pretty much to the tee. The only thing was that I could only find a devil's food cake mix that was 15.25 oz., but I used it anyway and it turned out fine. I also used a whole bag of the mini chocolate chips(which wasn't quite 2 cups),but the cake turned out fabulous. I did have to cook it just a little bit longer, and like another reviewer, I used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site and it was super yummy! Will make it again, definitely.

Love this recipe! I didn't alter it in anyway. I made this for a church gathering and it was a hit!  Made it again for a football party, again- a total hit!  I would like to try the "healthy" version that someone had posted as well as different flavored versions.  Trying peanut butter today!

The only thing I changed : instead of using oil, I used melted butter.  And I baked it for just 50 mins at 350 degF.  Super velvety, super chocolaty without being too sweet.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

A friend asked me to make a "show-off" chocolate cake that he could give as a gift to the staff at his primary care physician's office... and this recipe filled the bill very nicely.  I used a high-quality, very dark chocolate, added 2 Tablespoons Chambord raspberry liquer to the batter, baked in 3 layers, and made a simple ganache (2 cups very dark chocolate melting chips, 1 cup heavy cream melted together and cooled on the counter to retain its lovely gloss) to frost. 

Split 2 layers horizontally, turned cut sides down and brushed lightly with a couple more Tablspoons Chambord, then assembled with a bit of ganache between layers, and frosted with the remaining ganache and garnished the top with chopped black walnuts.  The third layer I cut in half to make a "half cake" for my friend and his neighbors.
Both cakes were stored in fridge about 36 hours before serving...
His Dr. reminded him that he was "NOT supposed to be eating things like this, but it's REALLY good!"
No negative reviews, and he was very pleased with the results...
Great cake, lovely presentation, not for daily comsumption!

Decadent - cut the morsels down to 1 cup and had to use 2-3oz small boxes of instant chocolate pudding (instead of the one large 5oz pkg called for) because it was all I had. Increased the water to 1 cup due to the density of batter with the increased instant pudding. Swapped coconut oil for the vegetable oil and used Egg Beaters instead of whole eggs for healthier option. This is a wonderfully dense, not-too-sweet chocolate cake that needs no frosting.

OMG!!!  Ok, I made and served this cake with the chocolate ganache recipe from this site to a group of friends and they can not stop talking about how "decadent, wonderful, amazingly scrumptious", etc. it was.  Almost everyone in our group are major chocolate connoisseurs, so I was a little nervous serving it. I have shared the recipe with all and I'm sure they will also have friends and family who will go bonkers over it as much as they did.  I added peppermint flakes to create a more festive design and it added just enough flavor to make this cake an "OVER THE TOP YUUUUMMMMMM"!  ENJOY EVERYONE!

This recipe has many names. I first made in the 80's, was listed in our church's annual recipe book. It was called "Soul Food Chocolate Cake". Over the years I've tweaked. At the holidays, I put in crushed candy canes along with the chocolate chips and peppermint oil. Another variation is adding cranberries. There's enough sugar so that the cranberries are just sweet enough.

As someone who doesn't enjoy cake very much, I'm really impressed by this recipe! I do substitute the sour cream with vanilla Greek yogurt. Same effect, and it adds a little something extra, I think. I really like that it's a dense, heavy cake. Everyone loves this recipe; it's my total go-to. I tend to make things from scratch, but this is the best I've ever made. Winner.

First attempt at a bundt cake. Added 1/4 cup flour to the recipe for altitude adjustment. Also added a chocolate ganache on top. I have to say, this was the most moist and amazing cake I've ever baked. I brought it to a Thanksgiving dinner party and it was a smash success. People kept nibbling on it and it was half gone before the dinner began.

Thank you for this recipe!I made this cake yesterday for my mom's birthday. She loves it!:) I didn't find an instant pudding mix, so I just made a pudding mixture from scratch. And, I used triple chocolate cake mix instead of devil's food cake. Since it has a real fudge mix, I only added 1/3 cup of dark chocolate chips. I also followed the advised of others to reduce the oil to 1/2 and add 1/3 cup of milk. It so fudgy!!! I coated it with Kittencal's Chocolate Frosting. It's so sinful! My collegues are convincing me to make another one. They want to order! :)

I made this cake for a family get together and topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze (as recommended by many reviewers), and I thought it turned out great. It did not taste "chemically" at all like some of the negative reviews have stated, but be warned that this cake is EXTREMELY rich. This is not a problem for me because I love chocolate, but it did receive mixed reviews. A lot of people said it was "too sweet." I give this recipe 4 stars because it is a delicious chocolate cake, but not everyone who tried it agreed.

I am gluten intolerant, so I almost never bake, and when I do I can't taste what I make (sadness).  That being said, I needed a special cake and a search turned up this recipe.  The only substitution I made was two sticks of butter instead of oil.  I literally sat near the kitchen just to enjoy the incredible smell of this cake baking.  My lucky recipients told me this was "the best cake ever", to "not make any changes", and that it was "probably several sins" to consume it.  Thank you for turning this clueless cook into a Cake Hero! **UPDATE: I tried to make this as a layer cake today and it was a miserable failure.  Stick with the bundt pan. :-)

hubby requested chocolate cake for his birthday, so i began a short search and came across this one.  4000+ reviews and 5 star rating made this recipe the chocolate cake of choice.  i made some minor modifications, only because the devil's cake mix and instant pudding did not come in the sizes indicated in the ingredients.  i used a 16.5oz devil's food cake mix and 3.9oz instant pudding, with success.  this cake was extremely moist and absolutely delicious.  i admit i was a little skeptical, as i haven't purchased cake mix in a very long time (i prefer making foods from scratch).  i also made the satiny chocolate glaze to top off this cake and sprinkled with semisweet chocolate chips, as seen in the pic.  the satiny chocolate glaze recipe can be found on allrecipes as well.  this is a keeper, for sure!

Delicious, moist....did I say delicious? I took others' suggestions and cut the oil to 3/4 cup and subbed plain greek yogurt for the sour cream and only used 1 cup of chips, which were plenty! Thanks for the recipe!

This is my go to cake recipe. I subtitute the sour cream for plain greek yogurt and the oil for applesauce and I only put one cup of chips and it is still very moist and way healthier. Thanks for posting this. My family loves it.

I was concerned...All of the cake mixes have been hit by the grocery shring ray, apparently. I purchased the pillsbury mix which was only 15.25oz...this was the largest package I could find. In addition, the pillsbury brand states that the mix contains pudding. I was worried the proportions and texture would be ruined. I made the cake precisecly according to direction and it was perfectly moist (not droopy wet) with a sweet (not sickeningly) and rich flavor. I only use the Hershey dark chocolate chips...they are worth the $2.69...you can actually taste the dark chocolate. In addition, I did not use an entire two cups of chocolate chips. I added approximately 3/4C chips to the mix, I then spread the mix into the bundt pan, upon which I sprinkled an additional 1/2C of the chips. I was alarmed at the gelatin like consistency of the mix; however, the cake did not seem to be affected. The cake was flavorful, dense but not clay-like, springy, and not overly sweet. You can feel satisfied with a small portion...and that way just cut the rest into small portions and freeze the rest. It should last a while this way.

Absolutely amazing! I make this cake often, and also take it with me as a hostess gift. It is always a hit! Depending upon the audience, I add anywhere between a quarter and a teaspoon and a half of cayenne pepper. The spice really makes the flavor even better. I always butter the pan well, use Daisy sour cream, and the best chocolate chips I can find, ghiradelli of course. I serve the cake dusted with powdered sugar with a scoop of ice cream. Best cake ever!

I found this recipe years ago in the newspaper, it was called Triple Chocolate Cake, but I call it Bon Bon Cake because it is "good good"!
It makes me laugh that people will change the recipe and then rate it less than five stars, this recipe is perfect as is, yes it is overkill with the chocolate, but what a way to die!  If you want a "homemade" cake then go make a Wacky Cake, this is yummy and made at home in your kitchen so, to me it is "home made"!  While I have changed up the chips using peanut butter or butterscotch chips with yellow cake, the chocolate version remains my favorite. (if you use other chips be sure to dust them with flour as they will sink to the bottom for some reason)  And if you don't make a recipe as written and rate it low that means you are rating your own version of the recipe, not the original.

not crazy about bundt cakes so i've been making this recipe in a 11x15x1 jellyroll pan, bake for 20 mins, cools in 20 mins, so much faster! slice it up and freeze so i can take it to work or bring some out when the grkiddies come over. decrease oil to 3/4 c and add an extra 1/4 c warm water to make up for the lost wet ingredient and i like the mini-chips better. love, love, love this recipe, ty

Simple. Chocolatey. Moist. Yummo-licious. Perfect for those times or for people who just don't want icing. What else can I say? I'm not generally a fan of "anything cake-mix", but this was one instance in the interest of time and based on the many, great reviews, I went for it. Glad I did.

I've made this two years in a row for my son's bday party, the lastest time being yesterday. This cake comes out so great. I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup but it was so thick I just threw in maybe a tbs. more. I also subbed out the water for coffee since I had just made a pot of it. Topped with peanut butter frosting, it's great. My son's actual bday is tomorrow so I have to make it again for that. Super easy. Thank you!

It's so yummy! A tip for mixing in chocolate chips: before adding them to the batter, stir them with about a tablespoon of flour. This helps to keep them from sinking to the bottom of the pan while baking and keeps them suspended throughout the cake. I topped mine with a chocolate glaze and substituted an equal amount of coffee for the water to enhance the chocolate flavor. Lots of compliments on this one!

I made this cake at this last minute on Christmas Day.  My favorite flavor is vanilla and this was not my go-to cake recipe but I figured others might prefer chocolate.  Cake turned out great, everyone loved it.  Dusted it with powered sugar.  I noticed that my devil's food cake was a 15 oz box and my chocolate pudding around 3.4 oz, so I just roughly scaled everything down - 3 eggs not 4, 2/3 cup oil and so on and it came out fine.  Substituted buttermilke and butter for the sour cream.  A very forgiving recipe!

I made this cake for my best friends birthday and it was incredible!  It was very rich; just what a chocolate cake should be! I did not frost the cake and I was glad i chose not to because it really did not need anything extra. I did not use mini chips, as other reviewers suggested, and I had no problem with them sinking to bottom of the cake.  I also have used this basic recipe and changed cake/pudding/chip flavors with great success. My favorites were a carrot cake with white chocolate chips and butterscotch pudding.  I also made red velvet cake with vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips which was also devine!

Stop right here!  My wife is a self proclaimed connoisseur of DARK chocolate.  I have spent years looking for something that didn't make her respond with the gratuitous "yeah, it's pretty good".  It doesn't matter how good the cake was, it was NEVER "chocolatey" enough.  This is THE FIRST CAKE that met her excited seal of approval as being.  To add to the glory, I'm not a dark chocolate fan but I really like this one.  I did cheat a bit by using half bittersweet chocolate which makes a huge difference, and used chocolate fudge pudding.  True that you don't "need" any icing, but I found the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze on this site works great, and it's super easy.  If you are on a quest to find a cake so dark chocolatey good that it makes your head want to cave in, stop right here.

This cake was very moist and a little dense but not heavy. It has tons of chocolate flavor! I followed the recipe exactly (except I used mini chocolate chips as another reviewer suggested) and it came out perfect. I will be making this easy cake again. When greasing my bundt pan I used vegatable shortening and instead of flour I used cocoa powder. That way you don't get a white dusting on your chocolate cake.

I LOVE chocolate. But I don't like all of the sugar in it. So i found, while making this recipe, that you put regular flour in, and then whole wheat flour for he sugar instead. I actually thought it made this resipe taste a whole lot better.

Very tasty. So rich, I could only eat a small slice. Tasted more like a brownie than a cake. (I only get a craving for chocolate cake occasionally. Fans of such cake probably like this recipe more. Considering that this has 3,000+ ratings, I guess so.)

Amazing and soooo easy!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using MINI semi-sweet chocolate chips.

delish - i made these into cupcakes.  1. it made a LOT of cupcakes for me.  I got 30 from one recipe.  2. it took longer to bake than a normal cupcake recipe.  I started with my normal 18 minutes, but extended 2 minutes at a time until they were finally "toothpick clean" at 26 minutes.  I baked at 350 as the recipe indicated.  I also used 1/2 c. oil instead of 1 c. and added 1/3. c. milk.  Not sure if that helped or hurt, but just in case you need that info. they are slightly soft for a cupcake, but i think when i get a nice buttercream atop it'll hold together.  i'll also probably refrigerate the final product so it will be as firm as possible.

This was just something I tought I'd do last night while the weather was cool enough.  I don't normally bake so I didn't plan having a good outcome but I was wrong.  This was a amazing.  I used less oil and less chocolate chips and added cinammon to the batter.

I also didn't have a bundt pan so I made it in two loaf pans.  I think I undercooked it a bit but it was absolutely delicious... althoughthe reason I don't know for sure is because I only allowed it to cool for 1/2 hour.

I made this cake for when my family came. I used 3/4 cup oil and it came out perfect. Nobody could wait 1 1/2 hours for it to cool so we ate it 30 min after it came out. I drizzled white chocolate over it and it was the best. I loved the melted chocolate chips in the middle. I will be making this again.

I made this cake for a charity auction which sold for $75!!!
I substituted amaretto for the water and left out the chocolate chips. White icing glaze and some chocolate covered strawberries as well.

It was too much. But very tasty- I melted homemade raspberry jam and used that as a filling between two layers of cake from two 9 inch rounds. Frosted with white standard frosting and decorated with fresh raspberries for a 35th birthday cake for my boyfriend! Tasty, yes. Probably better as a standard bundt cake however- it lost some moisture being a layer cake, I think.

OMGoodness this was soo wonderful. We did however get a small jar of hot fudge and melted it over the top of the cake right when it came out of the oven. I will never make a chocolate cake as moist and delicious as this one.  Thank you for my recipe box addition.

This cake is easy and delicious.  Its very moist..I get rave reviews when I make it.  

I have also done the exact same recipe only swapped out the cake mix to lemon and lemon pudding added a tbs of poppy seeds instead used white chocolate chips (not sure if it was needed) and the zest of one lemon....I was told by many people it was the best lemon cake they ever had.  So this recipe could probably be swapped out for many flavours.

This cake was the first bundt cake I ever made! And it is absolutely out of this world! It didn't even last a day in my house.. On top I used a white chocolate glaze to compliment all the chocolate and it was killer!! I will make this cake more often and it was so simple to make. Thank you!!

What a delicious cake! I used mini and regular size chocolate chips.  To keep them from sinking to the bottom of the cake, pour the chips in a bowl, then sprinkle them with a little of the dry cake batter; this coats them and keeps them from sinking.  I made this in a 9x13 pan for a potluck. It was gone quickly!

This was good, but I thought it was a bit oily.  Will definitely cut back on the oil by half next time I make it. It is moist and chocolaty though.

As suggested I cut back on the oil and used the mini chocolate chips and the cake was amazing. To my misfortune our bundt pan had been thrown out a few weeks prior due to lack of use. I made this in two 9" pans then used an easy home made vanilla icing between the two to keep them together (milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract). I then drizzled the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/satiny-chocolate-glaze/detail.aspx) over the top along with the remaining icing. It ended up looking and tasting great! Side note: It was a great way to impress the girlfriend's parents.

I am about 99% positive that this is the exact recipe that my local (and favorite) bakery uses for their delicious cakes. I made it for my mom for Mother's Day and she absolutely loved it! So did everyone else, as well as the homemade vanilla icing on it! She has now nominated me to make all of the other cakes for the future holidays, including her and my dad's upcoming anniversary. Yumm-O!

I am eating this as we speak.  I couldn't wait for the cake to cool and it tastes like a chocolate molten cake.  So good, but a little rich.  I think once the morsels harden, it won't be as rich.  This is delicious!  I will try applesauce next time because a cup of oil is a lot of fat!

Amazing!  Easy and super delicious!  Only complaint was it was so hard to tell if it was done bc of the melted chocolate chips, but still will make again and again and again :)

I followed the recipe exactly. The richness of the chocolate is the perfect amount. However it's tastes very artificial. Mine ended up burning at the top so I sliced of the burnt parts and topped it with chocolate frosting. I didn't even keep it in for the full time! Everyone who's tried it, likes it. I am a perfectionist and very picky. I'd make it again and to try different frostings.

This will be my cake I bring to everything! If you like a little less chocolate and a less dense cake, skip the chocolate chips. I also used 3/4 cup of oil instead of a whole cup and made up for it with water.

I have been making this recipes for years and have been so pleased with how easy it is to make and how well its received. Recently I realized that I can't find the cake mix in the 18.25 size. I bought the biggest I could find, which is 16.5. I'm curious if others are having the same trouble and how you've either added more flour/ingredients to the mix or reduced the other ingredients.  Thanks!

I like the chocolate version and I've made it a few times. Tonight I made a different version recommended in a review. I used strawberry cake mix, vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips. It was way too sweet and the chips stuck to the pan and the cake came out in chunks. Stick with the original chocolate recipe.

This is and has been our family's favorite chocolate cake for years!  Decadent enough for the most important occasions!  Drizzle with lots of chocolate and white chocolate - or use a glaze from your favorite "other" recipe!

I made this for my mother in law's birthday and it was a major hit!  It was dense and moist and had the perfect amount of chips in every bite!  I did use the glaze from this site as well, and it didn't turn out right, but I realized I forgot an ingredient later that night.  The cake was still wonderful though despite my mess up! Will make again and again!

Very chocolaty and very easy to make - can whip this up as a quick last minute idea for a dessert. I can't give more than 3 stars for something out of a box, but it's good, but not excellent.

I tend not to go for recipes that call for pre-made mixes, but I was in a bind and I needed a cake recipe that I could whip up quickly. It really was too much chocolate, but in the best sort of way.

This case was moist and very chocolaty.  I used a 1/3 cup butter and 2/3 cups oil.  Otherwise made according to instructions.  Used rectangle pan and baked approximately 50 minutes.  This case was moist but I like a richer taste.  Maybe next time I will use all butter instead of oil, and milk or evaporated milk instead of water.  My son was not sold on the taste and he is usually my biggest fan.  Definitely for the mature chocolate lover.  May also use milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet chips.

I don't even like chocolate, but a friend requested chocolate cupcakes for a birthday party. I found this recipe and have to say, it is AMAZING! I used mini chocolate chips as well, and I liked the texture they created. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on!

This is my absolute FAVORITE chocolate cake recipe. I follow it exactly and it couldn't have turned out any better every single time I make it. I use a round cake pan and create a layered cake with this recipe. The sour cream and the chocolate chips really take this cake to a whole new level. I'm an avid baker and much prefer to make things from scracth and even with this recipe calling for cake mix, I will continue to use it every time I make chocolate cake. It's that good.

Made this for book club ladies and what a hit.  I was begged for the recipe not only because it was so moist and chocolatey but the icing I added.  It is a coffee, cocoa & kahlua icing which gave it even more flavor.  Add 2 tblspns butter, softened, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar to a bowl.  Heat 3 tblspns water and add to 1 tblspn granulated coffee, 1 tblspn cocoa.  Pour into bowl then add 2 tblspns kahlua and mix.  If too thin, add more powdered sugar, if too thick add dash water or kahlua.  I also added large Girhadelli chocolate chips.  This is a keeper for sure.  Next time I might try strawberry icing.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

I baked this cake just as the recipe states.  However, the middle of the cake was raw and the outside was crispy.  The whole cake was ruined!  I was very disappointed.  I was supposed to bring this delicious cake to a family event and I had nothing!!

This is definitely a delicious, easy, and quick cake to make with ingredients that are typically already in your pantry. It turns out perfect every single time and is a great go-to potluck cake. I don't think it's spectacular or anything exceptional, though.

I thought that I would definitely need to frost this. I was wrong. So moist! The only change I make is that I use warm coffe instead of warm water.

I was a little afraid of how rich this might turn out and used only 1 cup of the chocolate chips BUT next time I will throw them all in,, this was like a cakey brownie,, I liked how it was easy to cut. I made it and then cut it,,topped with vanilla icecream and chocolate syrup and WOW!!! De-Lish.

This is such an amazing recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.  I have made it as a layer cake, regular sized cupcakes, and mini cupcakes.  All turned out excellent and resulted in many compliments.  I do substitute about half the oil for applesauce but you would never know it by tasting them.  For even more decadence, I topped with chocolate buttercream frosting.  YUM.

I tried this for Valentine's day and my husband and kids loved it. My sister asked for the recipe. I did use the satiny chocolate glaze from this site. It is so good. Better the next day and really good at room temperature because the cold isn't masking any of the flavor. Plus, I like the frosting a little softer but my husband likes it fresh out of the fridge. It was so good I immediately made another one when this one disappeared so I could share it with co-workers.  They loved it as well.

It was really good, but it honestly didn't taste much different from a straight out of the box cake. . . And I made just as directed. So why go to the extra effort to add all the special ingredients? Next time I want a delicious dessert, I'll go for the homemade version.

I found a similar recipe years ago in a newspaper.  Mine also calls for 1/4 cup Kahlua, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 2 Tablespoons grated orange peel (which I omit because we don't prefer it).  I also substitute mini chocolate chips for the regular ones because it adds that flavor without biting into a big chip.  

This cake also freezes well!

I did change up the recipe a bit, based on other reviews. I substituted tofutti sour cream to make it non-dairy, and turned the warm water into coffee. I did use the full cup of oil. I baked it in mini cakes bundt pan for 20 minutes at 350, and then reduced the temperature for the rest of the time-until it was baked, was probably another 20-25 minutes. In the future I would probably change up the cake mix, pudding and eliminate the chocolate chips. This cake worked well in the bundt pans, but was not very chocolaty or even a 5 star cake. The cake was fast to make.  I would probably make it again with the changes I mentioned.

I have to admit that it wasn't "the best" chocolate cake ever. I used a 9x13 because I didn't have a bundt pan so I baked for 40 min. On 325 like someone else suggested and it is mushy like its raw. Not sure if it is supposed to be. Put it back in for 10 min. On 350. Still mushy. Should it have an uncooked consistency. Also not a super chocolate flavor.  Kind of rubbery consistency.  Next time I'll use a bundt pan to give it one more shot. Ugh.

I found this because my husband loooves chocolate cake and I wanted to make him something for his b-day. I tested it out on our valentine's day dinner (he has to work tomorrow :( ) Anyway it holds very well in cake molds (I don't have a bundt pan). Just be careful and watch it as you bake it. lol. I had enough for cup cakes and they burned.

Decided to throw out the traditional pecan pie for the holidays (none of my kids would eat it) and bake this. It was a HUGE hit. It is an awesome recipe and have made it several times since. The tip to use the small chocolate chips it a must. Use the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (and a dusting of powdered sugar) on this site for topping.

DELICIOUS! I didn't have a bundt pan so I used a 13x9 pan..baked at 325 degrees for 40 minutes. This was one of the best cakes I've ever ate. I brought half of it to work, everyone loved it! I made it exactly as written with the exception of the pan and baking time, like another poster sugested I  mixed all the wet ingredients first.

This recipe has always been amazing - it also went gluten-free with ease by using Pamela's Chocolate Cake mix instead of a conventional mix. Superb!

I recommend greasing the pan liberally with butter for a lovely buttery crust to form. I find that it needs about 5 more minutes in the oven, your mileage may vary.

This was a very tasty cake and easy to make.  I made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze to go with it.  It wasn't very sweet (which I like) so adding a bit of whipped cream with each slice made it perfect! Everyone here loved it!

I'm sorry, but I just didn't care for this cake.  It was much too oily for me and I am not someone that tries to make desserts healthier by subbing applesauce or anything like that.  I much prefer the Cavity Maker Cake on this site for a doctored mix chocolate cake.

Yummy! Very moist and delicious and has room to play around with flavours. Next time, I might try to use some coffee liquer instead of the warm water! Thank you for an easy and delicious dessert recipe!

This cake was AWESOME!!!  The only little changes I made were substituting sour cream for whipping cream  and I went with the recommendations in the other reviews and used 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup milk.  Best chocolate cake ever!!!  I am trying this recipe now by using a strawberry cake mix, vanilla instant pudding, and white chocolate chips.  We will see how it goes... Thanks Denise!

I have made this no less than 20 times and always was a success. 

Modifying can include adding spices; cinnamon, cardamon, allspice, nutmeg, any dried pepper like cayan.

Amazing cake!  

Came across the recipe looking for an easy, delicious, chocolate birthday cake, and this fit the bill.  I've now made it 3 times in the last 3 weeks.  Works well as cupcakes, too (almost seem like chocolate muffins - no frosting, etc., needed).

Excellent recipe.  I typically bake cakes from scratch but this was too easy to pass up.  I would agree with other entries to lessen the amount of oil-I used between 1/2c to 3/4c.  I also used the "mini" chocolate chips.  Very good-my husband could not wait for the cake to cool enough to cut!  Will make again

I made this for a cake walk at our school and it was the first cake grabbed.  It really fits the name well and just needs some vanilla ice cream on the side!

I made this recipe then made it into mini cupcakes and cooked for 10 min.  They turned out AMAZING. Then i took Pillsbury cream cheese frosting and put blue food coloring in it. I made the frosting really cool. After the frosting was on i put on edible pearls.  They tasted delicous. I am sooo happy i made these it turned out WAY better than i expected.

I use allrecipes all the time, and this recipe is truly one of my favorites.  I changed nothing. I did however, use mini chocolate chips instead.  The key to success for me was exactly 55 minutes in a thoroughly preheated oven, and no less than 1-1/2 hrs. to cool.   You will think the cake is not done, but the chips have to harden again.  Amazing.  I can't keep it in my house.  It's gone so quick.

I give it a 5 star cause every time I make it, it's gone. One of the things that I changed is that I used half the amount of oil, and I used coconut oil instead. Another thing is adding different size chip in it. This is a recipe you will always want to have on hand.

This recipe is outstanding. Made it for Christmas dinner & everyone loved it.  Used mini chips as suggested by one reviewer & the chips were evenly distributed throughout the cake.

this was so tasty! We made it for Christmas, since the girls wanted to make Jesus a Birthday cake... The cake mix I had was only 15.25 ounces and I had a cook n serve package of pudding (vs the "instant"). I had to add some flour to the batter until it seemed to be the right consistency (not sure how much I added, maybe 1/4 - 1/2 cup... plus had all ten fingers crossed!). Used dark and mint chocolate chips (the little green spots can look unappetizing if you are uninformed!) and Duncan Hines Amazing Glazes.. topped with a sprinkling of powdered sugar... Oh. My. Gosh. This was chocolate heaven!

I served it warm not letting it cool all the way and my guests said it wasn't done but the next day when it had cooled it was the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. With the pudding and chocolate chips it needs to set and firm up before serving.

Strangely I though this cake was terrible. I have gone back again and again to see if I missed something but I don't think I did? I will try again but the part I really hated was the texture of the chocolate chips on the bottom of the cake....which was the top when you flipped it. Not sure what went wrong.

Not the best, but certainly a great change from just using a cake mix. Used greek yogurt as sub for sour cream; only 1/2 cup oil; only 1 cup chocolate chips.  Cooked a bit longer at 335 instead of 350.  Chocolate glaze on top with some sprinkles.  Even better the next day.

I made this for my high school students and it was very well received.  I cut back to 3/4 cup of oil.  I was a littleconfused by the pudding mix.  I have never seen a pudding box that big.  The ones in the stores aroundhere are usually around 1.4 oz, not 5.6 oz.  What am I mssing?

I followed the directions exactly and it was only meh. Yes it is intensely chocolately and that can lead some chocolate lovers to believe they are eating a fabulous cake, but I really think there is room for development here. The flavors are not totally balanced and could be better to make a "to-die-for" dessert that one just can't seem to get enough of.

this turned out like an ordinary cake, nothing to write home about.  it'll do in a pinch.  i did add a powdered sugar dusting with my sifter, which made it look pretty.  other than that, it was fairly ordinary.

Fantastic Cake!  For the 'store bought' mix - I used Duncan Hines Decadent Chocolate.  It has an extra 'filling' mixture that made this cake even more rich and brownie like.  Everybody raved at work.

5star winner! Seriously lives up to its name. Ive followed the recipe exactly and its perfect but easy to play with. This last time I accidently picked up cook and serve pudding but no saw difference. I also made a banana pudding cake using vanilla mix and banana pudding, delicious and full of flavor. For a boxed cake this recipe rocks.

The first time I made this, it was excellent! Not sure what went wrong the second time, but it definitely wasn't as amazing. I am sure it is something I did...but I am not opposed to trying to perfect this one!  Really good.

Grossly delicious!!! We drizzled ours with hershey caramel syrup, the cake soaked up the syrup but the taste was phenomenal. Loved the easy ingredients however all those things mixed together makes the batter very thick. The thickness caused my cheap wm blender to burn out. I had to bake mine about 15-20 extra minutes longer than the recipe called for because the fork didnt want to come out clean, might have over baked it just a lil but I wanted it to hold together well so I am very happy with the results. Hubby and kids love it too however beware the effects it has on three year olds lol.

I used the decadent chocolate cake mix, a cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and sugar free fat free instant jello pudding mix and it was so good! Very dense but great flavor and looks good coming out of a bundt pan. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great cake!  My daughters and I love to make it as gifts for our neighbors!  About to make another now... Make sure the cake is cooled completely before sprinkling with powdered sugar (always hard for the little ones to wait for).  Thanks for sharing!

This is an awesome cake that I have been making for years but this recipe is almost identical to the "Cake Doctor" cookbook.  The only thing different is that this recipe uses 1/2 cup more oil which you can leave out (the recipe is for 1/2 C water and 1/2 C oil)  and the cake is still fantastic and the best choc. cake I have ever made.

Thought this cake was really good, however, I used one cup of oil and I have to admit that I felt it was too oily--you really don't need all the oil with the sourcream.  I will use this again, but will make it with 1/2 the oil per other recommendations.

This is my favourite chocolate cake recipe.  Every now and then I decide to try something new, but always come back to this one.  Last time I tried a different "5 star" chocolate cake (made from scratch, so a bit more time consuming) I was disappointed because it just did not compare to this one.  If you follow this recipe, you will have a fantastic chocolate cake!

I would give this recipe 5 stars for myself since I am a chocolate lover, but most of my family or friends can only eat a small slice or two due to the fact that its "too much chocolate" It is a great recipe, very moist and smooth. It has become a part of my Arsenal when i want to go all out taste wise. I definitely recommend making this cake at least once, it will be worth it.

Its true, this is the very best chocolate cake ever. (I left out the choc chips)In my convection oven, I baked for 40 minutes. I did not wait the whole hr and 1/2 to cool because we were too eager to taste it. It still came out perfectly after 10 min of cooling.

I made this in a cupcake version which obviously needed tweaking. Instead of a 5.9 oz pkg of pudding, I used 2 of the small ones (1.2 oz I think), fat free sour cream, and 1 cup of mini semisweet choc chips and 1 cup of large milk choc chocolate chips (plus the other ingredients). I baked for 16 minutes on 325 and they were incredible!! I also iced them with my favorite icing (Triple Chocolate Fudge Chip) - yumm!

I just had a bite DELICIOUS..the best chocolate cake ever.I took several suggestions and used 1/2 cup oil + 1/2 cup applesauce to replace a full cup of oil.used 1/2 coffee in place of water. Dusted the semisweet chips (Reg size) so they wouldn't sink to the bottom and they didn't. It was moist and just PERFECT!!

This is a great recipe for a chocoholic like myself.  Those who aren't chocoholics may not appreciate it as much.  I drizzled it with chocolate glaze.

Not that this recipe needs one more review, but I made this for my son's birthday party and it came out awesome!  I used Duncan Hines cake mix.  I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I substituted yogurt.  I also left out the chocolate chips because it didn't want it to be overly chocolatey since I was going to frost the whole thing with chocolate fudge frosting.  It came out dense and moist and just perfect!   On a side note, I also tried some recipes from pretty blogs with disastrous results, which is why I will always come back to this site, the reviews are so very helpful!

I've made it often and actually have a couple of slices left in my kitchen right now.  It is wonderfully chocolaty and stays moist for a long time.

I don't think I really need to rate this recipe because it already has so many outstanding reviews.  But, I have to say - this cake was amazing.  I added the satin chocolate glaze that I found on here.  Simply perfect - if you like chocolate :)

This was AMAZING.  I don't normally like chocolate cake because they tend to be dry.  This was super moist.  I did reduce the oil to 3/4 cup as suggested by other reviewers as well as used the mini chocolate chips.  It was so yummy that I made three of them for "thank you" gifts for girlfriends and each one of them asked for the recipe.  Super easy too. You won't be disappointed.  And I did not use an icing.  It was fabulous with out it.

I made this cake for a family gathering this weekend. It was a big hit! I received an enthusiastic compliment from every person that ate it. Normally, we don't care much for chocolate cake, but this was delicious. I topped it with the Satiny glaze recipe and sprinkled finely chopped walnuts on top. Perfection!

Made this cake last night; I was looking for a quick dessert.  I left out the chocolate chips (didn't want it too rich).  Came out perfect, moist, not too sweet, but just sweet enough to have with some vanilla ice cream.  Topped the cake off with powdered sugar instead of icing or glaze.

This cake is amazing. Great texture. If using this for cupcakes, bear in mind the amount of oil stains the liners, doubling up before baking doesn't really help. (Thought it would.) You might want to wait for them to dry and add a second afterwards if using for a pop of color. Overall, great recipe, will use again. Thank you!

My sister shared this recipe with me and now I call dibs on making it for family gatherings. I've made it several times, changed up the pudding mix and the chocolate chips and it always turns out great. I made it for my coworkers and, of all the baked goods I bring in, this is the one they wanted the recipe for. I always us the sugar free, fat free pudding mixes. I can't say enough good things about this recipe. It's just perfect!

I made this cake last night for my husbands birthday.  I followed the directions to a T.  I wish I would have taken the advice and not used the full amount of oil though.  Maybe half a cup would have been better.  The cake was good, really moist but it has a strange aftertaste which I believe could be the oil.  If I make it again I will use less oil and see if that makes it better.

I made this cake with my daughter while my wife was out of town.  It was easy to make and quite delicious.  Even my 5 year old son, who is a picky eater, loved it.  We're saving some for mom when she comes home. :)

This cake is amazing!  I made it in just a 9x13 pan and cooked for about 40 minutes and it turned out really well.  The edges were a bit overcooked but nothing drastic.  For frosting I just used the Hershey frosting recipe on the Hershey cocoa box.  Couldn't stop eating it.  As suggested by others, I used the mini chocolate chips so that they would melt better and they worked great.

I followed the recipe to a T. It had more of a chewy brownie consistency for us than a moist cake. But it tasted good. I topped it with Ina Garten's chocolate ganache, and fresh strawberries.

This cake was just ok to me. I used 3/4 cups oil as suggested by other reviewers, and the consistency came out fine. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but with the thousands of glowing reviews, I was hoping for no less than spectacular. It was good, but nothing to write home about - at least for me!

I needed to cook mine for 10 minutes longer. Made the outside just a touch crunchy, the inside moist and gooey and allowed the chocolate chips to completely melt into little puddles of joy (otherwise, when the cake cooled, they were harder than the cake). Made twice in 2 weeks for 2 requestors' birthdays! Served with a side of strawberries and hand whipped cream. Fabulous.

This cake was amazing! It was so moist and chocolatey, but not too sweet. I followed the directions exactly, except I used mini chocolate chips, as other reviewers suggested. I found that the cake cooked perfectly in 55 minutes (in a bundt pan). I was a little worried, since some reviewers said that it took longer to bake and the outside was getting crispy. Not a problem for me! I did use an oven thermometer to ensure the temperature was accurate.

I have tested 4 different chocolate cakes with similar recipes at the same time and this one was the first choice. It was the moistest. I also recommend the Double Chocolate Brownie Cake recipe.  And the Chocolate Lovers Favorite Cake recipe if you like a hint of almond flavor. I sprinkle my chocolate cakes with powdered sugar after they cool, no need for frosting.

So yummy!   I will try next time to cut some of the oil (it seems like a lot and not as necessary to have that much) and try mini chocolate chips.

The most moist cake i've ever made!!! thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!  I read the reviews and  added half the oil and added coffee instead of the water.  the only thing was i didnt know that it would rise so much thinking when i poured the batter in it looked like there wasnt much... boy was i wrong!  i split the batter into quarter sheets and baked for 20 mins.  it was awesome fresh out the over with some vanilla ice cream

I got a TON of compliments on this cake.  I've made it twice recently.  The first time I accidentally only added 2 eggs (instead of 4) and you couldn't tell.  The second time I took one of the reviewer's suggestions and used mini-chocolate chips and like that better.  Instead of powered sugar, I topped it with a chocolate glaze (you can get a bottle of it in the cake isle).  Wonderful cake.

Absolutely delish!  I forgot the chocolate chips and it was still one of the moistest and most flavourful chocolate cake I've ever made.

This has to be the best chocolate cake Ive ever eaten. I am not generally a fan of chocolate cake but this is definitely a keeper. I made this for a friend of my wifes that LOVES chocolate. She absolutely loved it. Called it "Heavenly" more than once. The cake was shared with some of their co-workers, as I sent it to work with my wife, and everyone praised it over and over. I will definitely be making this cake again and again. I am looking forward to trying the variations that have been posted in other reviews. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This cake is absolutely delicious.  I received so many compliments on it. I agree with others, the cake doesn't cook fully inside without getting a little crisp on the outside.  The next time I make this cake, I'm going to reduce the temperature 1/2 way through as one other person suggested.

OMG!!! I didn't actually try the chocolate version of this recipe but I am sure it is just divine!! I wanted to spice up the cake box recipe & found this but only had vanilla cake on hand. So instead of the Devil's Food Cake, I used Vanilla & instead of the chocolate pudding mix, I used vanilla. I also used about a cup of chocolate chunks. It was soooo gooood!!! & I can't wait to try the chocolate version! I also recommend not used the whole package of the pudding mix because I have used that amount before & it made the cake way to moist, as if it wasn't done all the way. I used about half of that & it turned out perfect.

This cake is delicious! It doesn't need frosting, but I made a frosting just in case some of my family members wanted to add some to their slice. The batter seemed to be thick, but it still worked out fine. I used fat free sour cream and sugar/fat free instant chocolate pudding mix. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This is a very easy and moist cake. My husband, who is not a big fan of chocolate, loved it. He even asks me to make it again.  I did add the Satiny Chocolate glaze (recipe by Ginger) after baking. I also sprinkled finely chopped walnuts to the top of the glaze so it was pretty as well as delicious.

This is probably the most delicious cake I've had in a long time! I made it for a family dinner a few days back and each and every person LOVED it. I would highly recommend sprinkling some powdered sugar on top and my family absolutely loved that I melted some white chocolate chips and drizzled it all over!

I made this today for a coworker.  It was great!  Like the other posters I lowered it to 1/2 c. vegetable oil, 1/2 c. chocolate chips and added 1/3 c. milk.  I cooked it in two 9" pans since I did not have a bundt pan.  The first piece was great but I felt sick after the second.

Made this cake for a coworker's birthday.  Too suggestion of PODGER1 and used fudge cake, and peanut butter chips.  Several reviewers used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (from this site).  I made it and drizzled it on top, which went down the sides.  I chopped the peanut butter chips and sprinkle them on top of the glaze.  It was almost too pretty to eat. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was great. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday. The cake was sooooo moist. The next day it was just as moist than when I took them out of the oven. I will be making this again, NO doubt. 
You will not regret it. EVERYONE LOVED IT.

This is a great recipe. I tried three different chocolate cake recipes to see which was best, and this was by far the winner! However, does anyone know how to adjust the baking time if using cake pans other than a bundt pan?

I made this into cupcakes and frosted them with Ina Garten's "Kathleen's Peanut Butter Icing recipe.

Because this icing (just 1 cup confectioners sugar) isn't too sweet it brought the cupcakes over the top. Doubled the icing recipe to have enough and piped it on with a star tip (1M) and pastry bag and placed a peanut on the top.  Rave reviews......

I started this recipe by "breaking the rules".  I used a small box of pudding and did 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce.  THEN, I preheated the oven, got interrupted, turned it off, put the cake in the oven, and noticed 45 min into baking that the oven was off.

STILL, i turned the oven on, baked it for a while longer and it came out amazingly.  I can't imagine this turning out any better.

SOOOO good.  I used the mini chips instead of big ones.  Made it the night before I needed it.  SO moist and yummy.  Just a big bunch of tasty fun.  Kids and adults, they ALL loved it!

The flavor was great, but the texture was actually very oily. I'd probably make it again with less oil. Not my top pick simply due to the nutrition aspect.

AWESOME and SO EASY!  My only word of warning:  make sure your bundt pan is big enough . . . what a mess I made.  :-/
AND, I recommend a drizzle of a ganache of sorts.  Melted chocolate and peanut butter mixed together makes an excellent topping.

This cake is soo moist and sooo good, I did use the mini chocolate chips so they wouldn't sink and did have a slight problem with the top burning a little bit I'll just put down the temp next time but other than that this will be my go to chocolate cake recipe if I ever need one, I used the chocolate fudge buttercream from this site and it is excellent! The two together is sure to fix any chocolate fix someone might have!!

One word..... AMAZING!!!! This cake was a big hit for my family. I sprinkled powdered sugar over it for decoration and put strawberries in the middle for decoration after it came out the oven and cooled and dry. Will be making this for now on to all events. so excited.

This cake is perfectly named.  It is rich, moist, delicious and you need a full gallon of milk at the ready!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  The regular sized chocolate chips melted into fantastic pockets of ooey goodness. Other reviews suggested altering the oil, the cooking time, the temp, etc. but I had no problems whatsoever with this recipe AS IS.  This is going to be a permanent favorite in my book.  A friends' daughter commented "How did she get the frosting on the inside of the cake?"  Love this recipe, and so did my party guests!

This cake was amazing. I made a bunch of mini cakes for my daughter's bday using this recipe. It was so rich and moist. But you HAVE to LOVEEEE chocolate to enjoy it. I iced it with chocolate buttercream frosting and covered it in marshmallow fondant. I also used this recipe, but altered, to make a vanilla cake and a strawberry cake.

This is THE best chocaholic lovers cake! I only made one substitution - I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the vegetable oil. Will definitely make it again and again. Thank you for an awesome recipe.

Follow this recipe exactly! This is an amazingly easy, delicious cake. I made it for a birthday for one of the girls in the office and now everyone else has requested it for their birthdays. Fantastic with chocolate glaze drizzled over the top. It may be high in fat/calories but you're eating cake, it isn't diet food-recipe is perfect as is!!

This cake is fantastic!  I made it for Mom for mother's day.  It was very dense and very moist.  I used mini chips based on other reviews.  I also added the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" and "Cinnamon Walnuts" (both recipes on this site) to the top of the cake and everyone agreed they were a huge addition to an already amazing cake.

Delicious. Everybody loved this cake. I didn't have mini chocolate chips as reviewers suggested but I didn't need them cause the regular chips melted just fine.
Only changes: used evaporated milk instead of water.
Glaze/Frosting: Used Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website, heaven!!

I made this cake exactly 'as is' and it was great!  I am a chocoholic and REALLY wanted to add frosting or glaze, but I opted for just powdered sugar.  I am glad I did!  It wasn't needed at all!  Moist and full of chocolate flavor!  I also used mini chips.  Will definitely make again and again!!!

AMAZING! I freaked out for a moment when I realized after the hour timer went of my daughter had "helped" by putting the oven on 200. Luckily I turned it up to 350 for a while longer and it still turned out great!

This was a very moist, chocolatey (of course!), delicious cake.  Mine turned out pretty dense in texture.  I followed the recipe except I used fat free sour cream.  I also added a glaze I made of milk, sugar, and vanilla, which made the cake stand out even more.  My guests and I loved it!

I love this recipe! The cake is so moist and very rich. I went with someone elses idea of using mini semi sweet chocolate and it was perfect! I followed the recipe exactly how it's written except I added chocolate glaze and powdered sugar and some fresh strawberries.

Delicious. Way too many calories but if you are going to indulge, worth it. Why try to make it "more healthy?" You're eating chocolate cake. :) Just eat a small piece, and make sure you have lots of folks to finish it off! Thanks for the recipe, I will be sure to make again, just not often!

Soooo easy and good! I always read reviews first... made this with 1/2 cup veg. oil and 1/3 cup milk, and no chocolate chips, then covered with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site. It was so moist and delicious I made another the same week! Love the full chocolate mix, but also found spice cake and pumpkin spice pudding went together well. No chips needed   :)

Excellent! Rich and moist - I don't think I'll frost them! Did as other reviewers suggested and used only 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup milk instead of water, and mini chips instead of regular size. Note: the batter will be VERY thick. I made appx. 24 cupcakes, baked at 350 for about 20-25 min (until toothpick is clean). This is five stars in my book not only because of taste but because of how easy they are to make. Delicious.

Good but not great in our opinion and the fact that it takes so much sour cream and oil to it makes it a cake I will not make again.  I made it as stated and I believe people have had much more success by cutting the oil in half.

First let me say that I do not like chocolate cake. This recipe however changed that for me. I didn't change a thing and this was the most amazing recipe! I felt like it didn't need a frosting, glaze, etc. I'll be making this cake again (by request) for Easter. Yumm!!!

This is easily the best chocolate cake that I have ever had.  I have made it numerous times and it always disappears within a few short days!  I do make it with the miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips and it adds such a chocolately flair to each bite!  Perfect when reheated in the microwave by theh slice - great with ice cream on the side as well!  Just an all-around GREAT cake!

I wasn't sure about sour cream in a cake because of a childhood memory of mayonnaise cake that I didn't like - so I was scared it would be a similar taste.  BOY, was a I wrong!  This is my staple go to chocolate cake.  Simple, easy and over the top delicious.  The house is filled with an intoxicating aroma while it bakes and you cannot help but try some after it comes out of the oven - suggest at least 30 minutes cooling first :)  AND you don't even need frosting.  SINFULLY delicious.  Thank you, thank you THANK you for sharing this marvelous recipe.

My mother made this identical cake back in the late 70's, early 80's. It was called 'chocolate cake for chocolate freaks'. She passed away in 1982, but this is such a fantastic recipe that I have continued making it all these years and haven't changed a thing. Only thing is -really play up the chocolate and frost it with fudge frosting. (homemade of course, not canned). 1 box confectioners sugar, 1tsp good vanilla extract, 1 stick butter (real please and room temperature) pinch of salt and 1/2 cup regular cocoa. Lightly whisk in bowl, add cold milk, start with about 4 tablespoons - add till all incorporated together- but not thin. Mix on high speed 1-2 minutes. It should be light, fluffy, creamy - and delicious.

Chocolatey goodness, YUM, and  beautiful too!  Powdered sugar on top, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream and your set!  Company loved it, and so did the cook.  :)  So, so moist.  I may try to halve the oil and increase the sour cream next time...the guilt almost too great after eating it...I will post again and let you know how it turns out!

I used the recommended 1 cup of oil and it turned out PERFECT!!! I also used the 3.5oz box of instant chocolate pudding and not the 5.9oz.  I used the mini chocolate chips and that helped keep them from falling to the bottom.  

This is a Great cake to take to a Pot Luck or for someone who really loves chocolate...I used Powder sugar on top but next time I may drizzle some White Chocolate !!

I WILL be making this again :)

This cake is great!  I tried to do the decreased oil and increased milk and it was good, however, it doesn't stand up as well to fondant work.  Made with the full cup of oil (I used mini chips so the big ones wouldn't sink), it stacks perfectly!  I used a peanut butter buttercream and chocolate ganache, it was heaven!

Made it with the small box of pudding and mini chocolate chips because that is what I had, and a 9x13 pan.  Excellent cake, try melting some chocolate chips with a little splash of heavy cream and spread over warm cake.  To die for!!! It is a weekly request at my house.

Wonderful and everyone at the table agreed! used chocolate fudge cake (betty crocker) devils food pudding and mini cc's. topped with chocolate ganache recipe from this site I made 1/2 the ganache recipe and if you like molten cake heat in micro for 20 sec's !!!!
Update: made a yellow butter recipe cake 1/2 cup of butter 1/2 cup oil vanilla pudding no chips everything else the same still used  1/2 the ganache recipe and our Japanese friends like this more then the chocolate version because it wasn't as sweet but still very good. Thanks for the recipe I'm sharing it with everyone!

Total disappointment.  Most recipes with 5 stars and a few hundred reviewers are excellent, this one not so much.  It wasn't bad or anything but just average.  Nothing to write home about.

Probably the most chocolatey cake I've ever had.  It was moist and perfect at 55 minutes.  I put a cream cheese frosting on it but it would have been just as yummy with powdered sugar.

I added a lil less oil than what the recipe called for and used mini choc chips.  Topped with the Satiny Choc Glaze from this site.  Everyone ranted and raved about how good it was.

Best chocolate cake I have ever had!!! I was really nervous about the batter because it was at a dense mousse like consistency but the cake turned out perfectly. I covered it with the Pro Ganache from this site and everyone loved it. Thank you for the recipe.

This cake was yummy!!!! When I went to measure sour crean I was a 1/4 C shy so I added 1/4 C buttermilk. Did not wait 1 1/2 hrs to remove from pan, Tastes really good warm w/the chips all gooey melty. Next time I will use 1C semi-sweet & 1C white chips. Made this again 3/14/12 this time I replaced the water with coffee, again couldn't wait eat warm with chips gooey melty good.

YUM!  Just made this cake for the first time yesterday and it turned out fantastic!  I followed the recipe as written - but had to bake it in two round pans as I do not have a bundt pan.  I followed another reviewer's tip of lightly coating the chocolate chips in flour, and they stayed put perfectly in the cake.  I also made some glaze for the cake to put between the layers, however the cake is so great the way it is, that it does not need any icing.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

My inner baker and my inner man were at conflict with other over how to bake this cake...by the way, this was my very first cake I have ever baked.

My inner baker wanted to follow the recipe exactly...my inner man wanted to mess with it a bit.  They both won!

I used all the ingredients as listed...inner baker wins!

BUT...I added one ingredient and cooked it a bit different...inner man wins out there!

First off, I did not bake it in a bundt pan but rather 2 round cake pans.  After letting them cool I added my extra ingredient: chocolate fudge frosting.

I spread a generous layer of the frosting on one of the cake rounds and put the other round on top of that.

Then I melted extra chocolate chips and drizzled over the top of the cake letting it run down the sides of the cake.  Once all the melted chips were on the cake, I spread the melted chips evenly across the top and as it cooled it hardened a bit.

People were amazed that this was the first cake I have ever made and asked me how I could ever make a better one.  Ahhh, but I have another thought, today I will take the extra frosting and frost the sides too and use the extra chips for the top of the cake.

Made this cake exactly the way the recipe calls for. Okay, one thing, I changed chocolate chips in for peanut butter chips and traded the powdered sugar topping for caramel icing. It was simply amazing. Great recipes. Follow it to the letter, achieve great results. Or mix it up JUST A LITTLE BIT and still get amazing cake. GREAT JOB!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would, it was AMAZING! I cut some sugar & fat out by using sugar free pudding mix and fat free sour cream as well and I'm sure you wouldn't have been able to taste any difference, this cake was so moist and delicious. My husband is in the air force so I love to send deserts with him to work for his coworkers who are single & never get a homecooked meal. He said he set the tupperware on the break room table and when he came back from his locker the rest of the cake was gone. Thanks for the recipe!! Amazing!

This was pretty delicious.. but a bit dry and actually not chocolaty enough for me. I melted chocolate chips and peanut butter in a microwave and poured on top. The topping made it a little more moist. I don't think I will make this again even though it was pretty good.

I wouldn't call this "Too Much Chocolate Cake"!  It's excellent and just right.  One reviewer mentioned using mini chocolate chips to keep them from sinking, and you can do that.  However, if you have regular sized chocolate chips you can coat them in a light dusting of flour and it should keep them from sinking.  I did this the first time I made this cake and it worked fine.  I am making this again today and I'm trying the mini chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Bravo! Best chocolate cake I've ever had. My mom, who doesn't like any kind of cake, took one taste of this cake and she loved it. It's very moist and super rich, so have a glass of milk on-hand! Best part about this recipe is that it's easy to make! I've spent much longer making desserts that aren't as good as this one. I used dark chocolate morsels instead of semi-sweet, and it was yummy. Also, the recipe itself doesn't call for a glaze even though there's a glaze in the photo, so I made a simple chocolate glaze to pour on top. If you've gone this far with the chocolate, might as well go all the way! This recipe is definitely going in my recipe box, and you bet I'll be making it for years to come.

I don't have a bundt pan so I had to bake it in a 9x12 pan. =/ It was fluffy, chocolatey, and delicious. It tasted a lot like a fluffy brownie. I will try this again when I get a bundt pan but, maybe less chocolate chips and use mini chocolate chips.

A great cake if you want a real easy, special creation.  Very rich!  I made exactly as the recipe stated and next time I will use half oil, half applesauce and light sour cream.  I'll bake it at 300 degrees instead of 350 like reviews sugges.

This is probably the first cake we have actually finished off in my house. I gave a few pieces to a friend and she immediately asked for the recipe.  If you want to make this even more decadent add a little caramel sauce. One slice and your hooked

I have been making this recipe for years and ALWAYS rake in the compliments.  I follow the recipe to the T, including the full cup of oil, and it always comes out moist and delicious. It's important to have it cool for the hour and a half before inverting on a plate.  Oh and this cake tastes better the next day.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I've made from a mix. I think I will only ad 3/4 c. of oil next time. It could have been cooked a bit longer in the middle, but the outside would have gotten too crispy and burnt.

This cake was easy to make & phenomenal tasting!  I drizzled caramel ice cream topping over it since it was so chocolately... Soaked in to the cake & it was delicious!

If you love chocolate, you will love this cake and it is so easy to make.  I added coffee in place of the water but used regular size chocolate chips.  Turned out really good!  Will make it again!

I made this recipe for a wine and cheese party and it was a big hit.  It's a very good chocolate cake.  
But since my husband can't eat chocolate, I also made  another cake like this but I made substitutions. I used a yellow cake mix..french vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips. It also turned out fabulous. I didn't try making the icing with the white chocolate chips though.   But everyone who at the white cake also loved it. I served both with a little Cool Whip.

WOW... I am shocked at hpw good this is. I just made it and it is cooling but WOW. I used the batter for cupcakes and the ONLY change I made was using mini chocolate chips so they would melt better. I just broke open one cupcake with no icing to check it out and it is AMAZING! I tastes almost like a brownie because of the chips and all of the chocolate and our son and my wife LOVED them just plain. Can't wait to throw some Vanilla cream cheese icing on these things! Thank you sooooo much!

absolutely amazingly delicious cake. I make this for my oldest son's birthday every year and lately more of the family has been requesting it on more and more occasions. It's delectable and delicious. For a great variation add some peanut butter chips to the batter as well. You won't be disappointed.

Thought this cake was great and easy to make. Not life-changing, as the hype may have you believe, but very good.  Next time, I will take other reviewers' suggestions and use mini chocolate chips, or full sized white chocolate chips.  I used a little less than the full cup of oil, but kept everything else the same.  I baked in a bundt pan and found that at 50 minutes, my toothpick came out completely covered with batter.  Baked another 20 minutes, which made the toothpick come out more cleanly, but not totally clean.  The cake was baked through and did not fall.  I actually think I should have baked the cake for another 15 minutes instead of 20, for a total baking time of 65 minutes.  Next time I will try that, and also reduce the temperature for the last 20 minutes to 325, as other reviewers have suggested.  Very easy cake to make.  Came out of the pan just fine.  Used Satiny Chocolate Glaze, also from this website, on top.

Amazing! We did this torte style, and used a brown sugar/cream cheese frosting, topped with a circle of maraschino cherries for my daughter's 10th birthday. It was yummy! We ate some warmed up the next morning for breakfast.

This was really good, but the edges were a little crispy, and I even decreased the temp to 325 since others reported having the same issue.  I also used only 1/2 cup oil and added about 1/3 cup milk.  I made the Chocolate Satiny Glaze on here; very tasty!

I have made this twice with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze and it gets rave reviews. I have substituted cut up premium chocolate bars for the chocolate chips, but that is all.  Super quick, super easy, super moist and the most important super delicious!

This was a good cake, not a great cake.  It seemed to get better with age, so my advice is to let it be for a day or two and then dig in.  Definitely chocolaty and the chips give it interest.  My husband said I would have done better if I served brownies.

Have made this twice now. First time I used dark chocolate cake, dark chocolate chips, and chocolate fudge pudding. Second time devils food cake, chocolate pudding, dark chocolate chips. Everyone loved both but preferred the dark chocolate version. The color and the taste were better...

This is a new favorite of both my husband and I.  So moist!  I have tried it once as cupcakes and once without the morsels (I didn't have any on hand) and it just wasn't the same.  I've learned to follow it exactly and use my bundt pan!

My sister-in-law gave me this recipe years ago only she called it Triple Chocolate Cake.  It is my favorite cake to make for an occasion.  I have been told to rename it "Quaduple Chocolate Cake" and drizzle choc. icing over the top, but it doesn't need it!!!  I get rave reviews every time.

I have been making this for a couple years now and every time I make it several people ask for the recipe. Funny when people realize how effortless it is.   I make chocolate cream cheese frosting to go with it on the side and warn people to try a bite by itself before adding frosting. It doesn't need any sort of glaze or anything unless for looks.  I usually put twice the pudding in it though. It started out on accident and found it is spongier that way.

This recipe for a chocalate cake excedes most I have tried before, Im bearly begining yet this cake was so easy for me.  I made a couple of changes though, i used half a cup of CARNATIONS EVAPORATED MILK instead of the water and i added 1/2 cup less chocolate chips since too much chocolate can be a little to much for some. The cake came out so moist and spongy enough to soak in milk. Thanks so much for the recipe, looking forward to making more.

This cake is about as moist as plain chocolate cake gets, which I love!  I health-ed it up a bit by using sugar free pudding mix, non-fat plain yogurt (for the sour cream), and apple sauce (instead of the oil).

Just made it 3days ago and its gone. My family loved it. The cake is perfect. I personally liked it better after its been in the fridge for 2 days. Flavor/texture  gets more intense, moist and dense. Glad I read all the other reviews and decided to try this recipe. Will make again for Christmas!

This is the most outrageous chocolate cake I've ever made and by far the most chocolaty.  It was amazingly moist and was pure decadence.  I topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze (recipe on this site) and sprinkled chopped glazed walnuts mixed with mini semi-sweet chips.  It looked like a work of art and I almost hated cutting into it.  I think next time I want to impress someone, I'll make this.  It's an eye-popper both in looks and taste.

I have a recipe very similar to this that I got out of a cake doctor book, the only difference is the amount of oil. It is a very good recipe. One way to not have all the chocolate chips sink to the bottom is save some of the dry cake mix and mix it with the chocolate chips, then after you have mixed all the other ingredients put the chocolate chips in and mix just until mixed. I have used that method and have never had chocolate chips at the bottom of the pan.

Delicious! I made this for a birthday so I decided to bake it in two 9-inch round pans instead. Following another review, I baked it for about 30 minutes but it was hard to tell when it was done because of the chocolate chips. In the end, I think I should have left it in a little longer. Also, be sure to grease the pans enough! It was my first layer cake so definitely not easy but it ended up being a big hit!

Awesome...I cut back on the oil a little and cooked in two 9" cake pans.  It only needed to cook for 30 mins.  The cake actually tastes better the next day and that is saying something because the first day it is to die for lol...Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Delicious cake. I, unfortunately, made it for other people so I only was able to taste the trimmings from the bottom left over from leveling it (it didn't absolutely need to be leveled, but I was dying to try it). It was delicious! I used fat free sour cream bc that's what I had on hand, chocolate fudge cake mix, I eyeballed the pudding mix, and used chocolate, and it turned out fantastic. Also, I used regular sized choc. chips and had no problem with them sinking to the bottom, very thick batter.

This is my go to cake when I need something yummy to take to a get together. It never fails me! I like to put chocolate frosting on it while it's warm and let it melt into a glaze. Today I made this and substituted hot coffee for the water. Very nice way to enhance the rich chocolate!

Absolutely delicious cake!  Made it for my chocoholic husband's birthday.  I made it as a two-layer cake and frosted it with whipped ganache frosting.  I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil, also fat-free/sugar free pudding and low-fat sour cream.  It was so moist and so chocolately and so incredibly easy.  Will definitely make this again!!

I followed the recipe exactly as directed and the cake came out amazingly well! It was super tasy and the chocolate chips added into the batter were like yummy little surprises in each forkful. I would recommend this cake to anyone looking for an easy yet delicious cake to make for guests, a party or holiday!

I have made this several times and it is a huge hit everywhere I take it.  I made 10 of these and served them at my parents 50th wedding anniversay party to 200 guests.  There were no leftovers.  My boss tries to watch what he eats and usually says no to everything people bring in, but he begs me to make this cake. I do cut the oil in half and add 1/2 c applesauce but that's my personal preference.  It's great either way.

I made this recipe mostly sugar-free and lower calorie by using SF pudding mix, fat free sour cream, no sugar added applesauce instead of oil, and sugar free chocolate chips. Topped it off with sugar free chocolate syrup drizzled across...  IT WAS AWESOME! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a potluck and everyone loved it!  Followed the directions exactly, which I like to do the first time I prepare a dish, so my review is based on the recipe and not "my version" of the recipe.  I can definitely see where using different flavor cakes/puddings/chips will make this such a versatile recipe.  Plan on trying numerous variations.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake is yuuummmy!   I have made this twice now and both times it has been a hit.  The cake is nice and moist.   It is good with a drizzle of chocolate on top or just by itself.

I made this into cupcakes. Cooked in cupcake liners at 350 degrees for 21 minutes. Turned out perfect in my oven. Only tweak to recipe was that I swapped the water for milk and went with previous reviewer's recommendation to use mini chocolate chips. Piped on a dollop of homemade dark, dark chocolate buttercream frosting and some 60% cocoa Ghiradelli chocolate bar shavings. A million thanks to the person who shared this recipe. I will never make another 'boxed version' chocolate cake again!

i made this cake for my dads 47th bday and all my family ate this yumi cake up.i did a little twist to the cake after it was done   first i froze the cake for about 30mins. than i melted 2 cups of chocolate chips with a tad of oil and used that for the frosting. than i put the cake in the freezer for another 30 mins. melted 2 more cups of chocolate chips with oil and did a second coat. after that i mixed 3.4 oz of cheese cake pudding and put it in the center of the cake. i put in the freezer again till the chocolate coat was hard. it was so delicious. thanks Denise for this recipe

Excellent cake!  I used one scant cup of sour cream and one scant cup of oil without changing a thing.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used mini chips.  This is a keeper!

This is a very rich heavy cake and it smells so good when cooking.  I have made this cake several times and it is always a favorite.  It also is firm enough that it can be easily decorated for a special occasion cake.  This recipe is a keeper.

I have made this several times with the recipe exactly as is and it works out wonderfully every time.   This time I took it the opposite extreme and it was very good too.   I used the recipe as written but I used a white cake mix, vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips.    I had rave reviews for this cake as well..

Dense, chocolaty and delicious.  I used a rich chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding (a larger pkg than called for) and skor mini chips.  I baked it in 2 9" pans (there was some spillover) for about 45 min at 350.  I covered it with peanut butter frosting.

Yummy and very moist! Made this without the chocolate chips because we were out and the cake itself turned out well. Because we didn't add the chocolate chips, we made this into a layered cake using this frosting: AR's Creamy Chocolate Frosting.

Really good chocolate cake.  I was unsure of the full cup of oil and decided to use 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce, no one noticed at all.  I will definately be using this as my go to chocolate cake recipe!

This recipe is great! I actually made cupcakes out of it and baked them for about 22 minutes, I used the mini chocolate chips and topped the cupcakes with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site. Awesome :)

Have made this several times using mini and regular sized chips, makes no difference. Always YUMMY! Last one I made I mixed chocolate and peanut butter chips, it was awesome.  Cutting back to 3/4 c. oil is perfect.  Does have a hint of the "boxed" mix flavour to it but over look that because it's such an easy cake to put together.  Warmed and served with ice cream is great too.

My husband loved this.  I didn't as much.  I put it into a 9x13 pan.  It had to bake for well over an hour.  The outside corners got hard.  I didn't care of the pudding in the cake.  But if yu like thick, dense cake. this is it.

This tastes exactly like Costco's jumbo chocolate chocolate chip muffins. Not Exactly as chocolatey as I was hoping for and at looking at all the calories not exactly worth it for me.  But it does bring back some good memories as to when my mom and me would share one of those muffins for breakfest and she'd give me the end pieces because she knew I loved those the most.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would.  It's a simply awesome chocolate cake.  It needs absolutely nothing on top.  It's incredibly rich, moist, and flavorful all on its own.  I didn't have sour cream, but did have a large container of low-fat plain yogurt, so I used that.  Also used 1/2 cup of brewed coffee instead of water.  It turned out beautifully.  Mix the chocolate chips with a little bit of the dry cake mix before stirring them in...they won't sink to the bottom of the pan.  Thanks for a great recipe! Update: I've made this probably 25 times now and it still gets gobbled up faster than I can believe.  I now use a bag of mini chocolate chips instead of the regular size ones and somehow it tastes even more chocolatey.  :)  Subbing coffee for the water is a must for even more of a chocolate flavor boost!

GREAT cake. i took advice from previous reviewers and used less oil...so i used 3/4 cups instead. I also only used a cup of chocolate chips, as 2 cups would have just been TOO much for my liking. But the cake was VERY yummy and everyone at my work ate the entire thing. I made a pretty big cake too, and it was gone pretty quickly. :) Thanks for the recipe!!! its a keeper for me. and might i add....if you're looking for a good chocolate frosting, use the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" posted by Amy Via...that frosting is superb with this cake!! :)

When i mixed this up, it had a really strange texture--thick and greasy.  I was worried that it would show through after baking, and i was right.  It has a strange consistency, that I wasn't a fan of.  Cooked at a lower temp than directed and it was pretty crispy on the bottom.  My family thought it was good, but not great.  Would cut the veg oil down and add milk like other reviewers suggested.

This cake is SOOOO goooood!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except for one minor adjustment.  I used mini chocolate chips instead of regular and it turned out perfect.  This cake is very moist and delicious :~)

UPDATE: (1/6/11) I have switched out the cake/pudding mix/chips and have been equally successful! yellow cake/vanilla pudding/white choc chips (yummy), and golden vanilla cake/pistachio pudding/ white choc chips + xtra pistachios (also very yummy)

I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday. The family loved it and she's still talking about how good it was!   I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe for the icing and garnished it with fresh raspberries. The raspberries really compliment the sweetness and richness of the cake.  Definitley for chocolate lovers! This cake will have you sneaking down to the fridge in the middle of the night for more!

I made this cake for my son's birthday and it turned out great and got rave reviews! I baked it in two 9 inch round pans and iced it with chocolate icing. The name couldn't be more fitting because I thought it was tooo much chocolate! I could not eat it without a glass of milk or scoop of ice cream, but I am not a huge fan of chocolate. Everyone else loved it though. It is very moist and 4 days later it is still moist and delicious! I followed the directions exactly and used mini chocolate chips. I can't wait to try some variations now with different pudding flavors and chips!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! Very moist, very easy to make! Made this for my bf's birthday and it is not his favorite chocolate cake! I made it in a square baking pan though and the center fell in alot... I think the bundt pan would have made it perfect! Next time...

This cake is fabulous. We have lots of out of town guests this summer, so I have made this twice in a week now, by request.  One change I made was replacing a 1/2 cup of the oil with a 1/2 cup of applesauce. Excellent moist, dense bundt cake.

This is probably the best chocolate cake I have ever had. This was a big hit. I made mine with fat free sour cream, egg substitute, and applesauce. Used mini chocolate chips as recommended. There is no need for frosting. Just zap your slice in the microwave to melt the chips before eating and serve with a nice cold glass of milk.

HI,  When i made this cake I made a few changes, after reading other reviews, vanilla yogert in place of the sour cream, 4 egg whites instead of the whole egg and rasp applesauce for the vegetable oil.  Then I baked it in two 9 inch round pans and put red raspberry spread in between each layer and to the ganach (chocolate) topping added the other half of the jar of rasp. spread.  Everyone loved it, so I am making it for July 4th too for a church potluck.  Thanks Christi

I've made this cake over and over because people love it so much.  (But mostly, I just make it so I get to eat it again!)   It's super moist.  Grease the bundt pan generously and it'll spring right out for you.  Great recipe!

A MUST TRY.  I actually got this recipe from a friend, but I just had to rate it because it one of the BEST recipes for chocolate cake.  For a BBQ party rather than have a bunt cake I put the batter into a mini muffin pan - finger food - just as tasty and I didn't need to supply forks/plates.

WOWIE WOW!  This cake is awesome.  I made exactly as written, but as cupcakes and I wouldn't change a thing.  The cake is very moist and very rich.  I used mini semi-sweet chips and frosted with Cookies n Cream Buttercream frosting.  I can't wait to take these to my in-laws today for the family BBQ.  Thanks for such a wonderful chocolate cake recipe.  I will be making these again and again and again.

I have made this cake 3 times now and I absolutely love it!   I decorate cakes and this cake has been great to stack.  It is dense enough yet sooo soo moist!    I have paired it with the Chocolately Fudge Buttercream and a Dark Chocolate Buttercream with Raspberry Fillings! Yummy!

The BEST chocolate cake I've ever made!  I used fat free sour cream and only 1/2 cup of oil and it still turned out so decadent!  It was also beautiful baked in a bundt pan and sprinkled with powdered sugar.

I made this cake for the first time 2 days ago. It came out really nice.  The height was good, and   it was super moist. There is only 1 piece left, and my nephew has his eye on it.  I used buttermilk, because I love the home made texture it adds.  I would make it again in a heart beat.  If you want heaven on earth, this is it!!!!

The name of this cake fits it to a T! If you are not a chocolate fan, then don't try this cake! I used half applesauce/half oil instead of one whole cup of oil. You can't even tell the difference. It is soooo moist! I baked mine in a tube pan. Took exactly 55 minutes to finish baking. This cake is so rich you only need a tiny slice.

I usually avoid doctored box recipes in favor of scratch recipes, but I needed something fast! This cake is PHENOMENAL! It is our households new favorite cake.  I usually add about a 1/2 tsp of bourbon vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I drizzle it with a simple cream cheese icing, cutting back on the sugar in the icing a bit. However, this cake does not a actually NEED any icing!

I made this for the first time for my neighbors.  It turned out beautiful and was very thick and rich.  I used normal sized chocolate chips instead of mini and really liked how it turned out.  The chips melted just a little so you got a big bite of delicious chocolate.  The chips didn't sink to the bottom, rather they were all through the cake.  I cut the eggs down to only 3, it make the cake much more dense which was great for holding the choclate chips.  My neighbors said it was the "best cake they have ever had".  Enough said!

I've made this cake too many times to count and they keep on requesting it.  It's easy and oh so good.  I make the recipe as written and use the Satiny Chocolate Glaze on it.  Some reviewers said they used regular cake pans and added a layer of raspberry preserves...that sounds so good and I'll try that next time.  Thanks Denise!

I used a chocolate fudge cake  mix and instead of warm water I used 1/2 cup coffee. For frosting I used cream cheese II from this site. The cake came out very moist and very good. It is the best chocolate cake I have ever  made.

I followed the recipe to a T. It was very very good. But, I would omit the chocolate chips next time. Because, I like cake that is just cake and nothing else but frosting. I think it would still be a 5 star recipe without the chips so that's why I gave it 5 stars.

I've made this cake many times and it turns out great every time. I usually use a German Chocolate cake mix instead of chocolate because my husband loves German chocolate cake. I also frost it with the traditational German chocolate frosting with pecans and coconut. Everyone loves it! Great recipe!!

I made this to cover with fondant for a mothers day cake. I used the recipe exactly with big chocolate chips...I quite liked the cruch they gave, but may use mini chips for a smoother texture next time. I used 2 x 9 inch pans and baked for 48 mins. Stuffed the middle with whipped ganache and covered with a ganache glaze then fondant. It held the icing wonderfully, tasted amazing, kept fresh and squishy for 2 days before serving and was devored in rapt silence! It is very rich, so it is nice to serve with vanilla ice-cream and in small portions. This will be my 'go to' chocolate cake recipe.

I used foil cupcake liners and it burned the mix right away. I tasted the middle of the cupcake and it wasn't very good; I could still taste the boxed cake mix. Please don't make again.

This was fantastic! I'm not the best baker and this was so easy. It turned out wonderfully. I used mini-sized chips instead of morsel-size and dusted the top with powdered sugar. My husband loved it and we ate the whole thing by ourselves! We put fresh fruit on the top with ice cream, but it was awesome by itself as well. I'm planning on taking it to a friend's house next week.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used mini-bundt pans.  I reduced the bake time a bit.  The "cupcakes" looked great, especially after I drizzled the ganache over the top.   I made it, hoping to get rave reviews from our crew.  It didn't really impress as I had hoped.  It was moist but the flavor was nothing to write home about.  After the build up from all these reviews, I felt really let down.

I made this cake for our company's "bake off" contest and it won first place and that was only my first time making it. I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top and then placed raspberries along the top and bottom. It was soooo delicious and moist. Definitely a crowd pleaser.

A TOTAL HIT!  Baked it in a silicone bunt pan and when I checked it after 1 hr my knife did not come out clean.  Had to add another 15 min to the time, but maybe because of my pan(?).  Used mini chocolate chips and used a homemade fudge frosting recipe and topped with Heath toffee bits.  Served warm as suggested and people were FIGHTING over the last bite.  This was amazing - THANK YOU!

Delicious cake and very moist - tastes more like 'from scratch' than from a mix.  I used fat-free sour cream to cut back on some of the calories and followed another reviewer's suggestion of using sugar-free pudding mix - it turned out great!  This is one of the few cake recipes I've tried that comes right out of the pan without tearing or breaking apart.  I'd like to try this method with some different flavors of cake mix and pudding...spice & butterscotch -or- strawberry.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had expected a lot from this cake since the author said it won several ribbons. The taste was just ok, nothing too special. I made the one bowl chocolate cake recipe from this site without the extra chocolate chips from scratch and it was just as good and chocolatey if not better. Since i prefer making things from scratch I will probably use the latter recipe for chocolate cakes.

Awesome cake! I used what I had on hand. Regular yellow cake mix instead of the devils food, but I still used the chocolate pudding mix. I only had half the amount of chocolate chips on hand, so I substituted the other half with cappuccino chips. The second time I made this cake, I cut back to half of the oil it calls for and it still came out wonderful. My teenage boys loved it and asked me to make it again! It was even better the next day and was so moist.

Very good! Very easy as well. I made this cake twice the first time using mini chips and the second time using regular sized chips. I preferred the regular sized ones. They held their shape while still being gooey and I liked the difference in texture it gave the cake, they didn't sink to the bottom for me.

I make a recipe very similar to this one only I add a teaspoon of almond extract.  It adds a deeper tone to the taste and definately does not take away from the extreme chocolate taste in the recipe.  It would probably be good with orange or mint extract too!  OOOHHH!  Now I gotta make a cake and experiment.  Anyone want to give me a reason to make this cake?!?  LOL

This is cake is amazing! Everytime I bake this, it's gone within a day! The only thing I ever change is instead of 1/2 cup warm water, I use 1/2 cup espresso or strong coffee. The coffee really enhances the chocolate.

Great recipe, I used reduced fat sour cream and fat free, sugar free pudding mix. And the cake came out great. I din't have enough chocolate chips for 2 cups and used 1/2 mini's and 1/2 regular sized chocolate chips, Didn't effect recipe at all. Thanks this one is a keeper

I thought this recipe was perfect.  I substituted apple sauce for the oil, but that was about it.  Rave reviews from everyone who tried it, and it has become one of the most requested items for me to bake!  Highly highly recommend this one if you haven't tried it yet.

This is the recipe I have been making for over 20 years!!!  And it is awesome!  The only difference is that I use coffee instead of water (usually I just add a teaspoon of instant coffee powder with the dry ingredients).

Overrated recipe. Not only did the outside get too overdone before the middle was adequately cooked, but the chocolate chips would have been much better had they been melted first. I didn't like biting into hard bits of chocolate when I was expecting smooth cake. The overall texture of the cake turned out more like a brownie - it was nice and decadent but I probably won't make it again in this way.

omg WOW!  I made these into cupcakes, baked them for 30 minutes and they are heavenly.  Soooo delicious.  Followed recipe exactly.  This recipe is spectacular.  far better then anything you could buy at the grocery store.  Like a gourmet muffin almost, maybe because of all the chocolate chips and because I made them with huge tops.  Yummy!!!

Really good cake. I was expecting a very dense chocolate cake, but it wasn't. Lighter than I thought. Use the glaze, I rated it higher because of the glaze.

I had to double check the recipe because the batter was so thick I thought I did something wrong.  Needless to say it turned out to be AMAZING!!!!  I made this for my Son's Birthday cake and it was so yummy all the parents of his guests requested pieces "TO GO" and the kids in his class were talking about the cake for almost a week after the party.  I will be using this recipe again for the class Valentines Day party...gotta give the little people what they want!  Honestly, this recipe is easy and the taste is 10 Stars but I could only give it 5!  My hisband also requested this cake for his Birthday it's so yum!

Awesome Cake!!! I added a very simple icing on top by microwaving Cool Whip and semi-sweet morsels and stirring them together. It turned out to be an excellent addition of chocolate to an already overly chocolaty cake.

I was in a hurry to make this, and I forgot to add the sour cream! It still turned out really great. They were more like brownies than it was cake, but I have a feeling that was MY fault. It was still a huge hit though. Super easy. I will make this again. Edit: I made this again, following the directions exactly, but I made cupcakes. They were sinfully delicious! I used fudge icing with mini chocolate chips in it. It was a huge success.

One of my absolute favorite cakes! Tastes like you spent hours fussing but is actually really fast and easy. Only thing I do different is add less chocolate chips(prefer a less sweet taste) and often use dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet. Really a moist delicious cake! Thanks!!!

I've made this for my husband's birthday 2 years in a row and he just can't get enough of it.  So delicious and easy.  I made it in a 9x13 pan and used the mini chocolate chips.  You just can't go wrong with this recipe.

This is an amazing chocolate cake! I am one of those people who usually look down on making box cake recipes but it turned out fabulous! I made it for a friend's birthday and there was none left! I followed the suggestions to use 1/2 cup of oil, 1/3 cup of milk, 1 cup of mini chocolate chips, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup of warm coffee instead of water. I also topped it off with the satiny chocolate glaze(the ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips work really well for this) and toasted walnuts, and put raspberries and blueberries in the center. The fruit was a delicious supplement to the chocolate! SO GOOD!

My grandfather, who doesn't have a sweet tooth, went back for seconds and proceeded to tell me it may be the best chocolate cake he has ever eaten! As a chocolate lover myself, I must agree that it was delicious!

I made this yesterday for a family party.  I doubled the recipe as written (use a big bowl!) and used the mini chips.  I cooked it in a sheet cake pan (12x16) and it came out great!  I can't remember the exact time it took-I'd say about 45 minutes but it was until the top was no longer liquid and firmish when pressed.  I frosted it in pan with buttercream frosting.  It was a hit!!  Descriptions like rich and chocolatey were used.  Needless to say folks took some home with them, too-a good comment for my family of great cooks! Will definitely make this again and am looking forward to trying the recipe in a bundt pan.  Thanks for this great recipe!  *****I want to add that I've made this a number of times as written as a cake with great results.  However, this week I've made it 3 times as cupcakes for various events.  I find that the oil is too much for cupcakes and leave the bottoms a bit greasy (though they taste fine).  For cupcakes I'd recommend using 1/2 cup of oil and the foil/paper combo as cupcake liners. The recipe makes 2 dozen cupcakes. I sold 2 dozen very quickly at a fundraiser yesterday with a number of kids comng back for seconds!  I used the minichips and buttercream frosting-yummy!

This cake wasn't quite what I expected. It came out with more of a brownie texture than a cake texture. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I used light sour cream and mini chocolate chips. It actually took 1 hour and 45 minutes to bake! I'm really not sure why, but I'm still astonished by that. I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and served it as one of the deserts at a party I was hosting. Some people loved the cake, others thought it was just ok, which is why I rated it 3 stars. I may or may not make this again, however, I'd be interested to see what a vanilla version of this cake tastes like.

Best choc cake EVER!!!!! I brought this cake to a friend's place and we were so full from dinner that I was afraid it would go to waste.....I got an email the next week from my girlfriend saying that not to worry her husband was getting up in the night to sneak a piece of cake.....it would certainly get eaten.

I baked this for a New Year Eve's party. Everyone raved that it was the best, moistest cake they'd ever had!  My sister said it was heavenly.  I even had a guest ask to take some home! Finally a MOIST chocolate cake recipe! Followed most of the recipe, except: I cut the oil in half and baked it in a 9x13 cake pan for 45 minutes.  I made Baker's one bowl chocolate frosting with it.

Oh this is GOOD!   I've made it several times but not too often because my husband can't learn to pace himself.  He'd eat it in a day if he had the chance, and he does not need all the calories. HaHa. Last time I made it I used Dark Chocolate chips which I thought added a distinction to the overall chocolate flavor.

This was a great cake!  I made it just as written and it turned out moist and rich but not too rich.  My mother-in-law said it was one of the best chocolate cakes she's ever had.  It was so easy to make...I'm not a baker but this turned out perfect!

I use the same recipe for an almond poppy seed cake using yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding mix, almond extract, and poppy seeds. I omit the water and add 1/2 c sugar.  If you grease the bundt pan with shortening and "flour" it with sugar, it gives the cake a nice crunchy crust. No need for a glaze!

I made this cake three days in a row for holiday parties and everyone LOVED the cake.  I filled the middle area of the bundt cake with rasberries and blackberries, sprinkled it with powdered sugar and it was a beautiful presentation.  I cut each piece added a dollup of whip cream with a few berries and they were really empressed with the presentation.

Wow, this cake is RICH! I topped it off with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site for my hubby's bday... and it was too die for!  Make sure you slice the pieces small, because it really is *almost* too much!  I did use mini chocolate chips and they melted perfectly.  I did have to leave it in the oven a little longer than the recipe called for.  I just couldn't seem to get it to bake for some reason, took about an hour or so.

This cake was incredible! I did the same substitutions that most other people suggested - 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk. I also made the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting (found on this site) and microwaved it for about 30 seconds so it would drizzle over the cake. Delicious! Got tons of compliments!

I do not consider myself to be a cake lover, and usually only eat it to be polite at birthday parties,  but I do love this cake.  In fact, my 11-yr-old son requested chocolate cake for his birthday, and, cringing at the thought of another store-bought mix with store-bought frosting, I came to allrecipes.com.  I'm so glad I did!  My only issue with this recipe is with its name:  I contend that there is no such thing as "too much chocolate."  That said, this certainly is a cake for those who really love chocolate!  Very moist, dense and flavorful, there can surely not be a better chocolate cake recipe anywhere, and as for me, I have stopped looking.  This was very easy to make.  I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze with this, and it was wonderful, but this cake doesn't really need icing.  Try this - you won't be disappointed.

FANTASTIC.  I've made it dozens of times and always make it exactly as recipe states.  

To those who don't like the "crispiness": Make it a day ahead.  My son always waits to eat it the second day, when it's soft and even richer tasting.

Great dusted with powdered sugar or drizzle some melted cream cheese frosting over it.

Let me just say that this is a wonderful chocolate cake recipe.  I made this and brought it to work for someone's birthday and got mostly rave reviews.  Some said it tasted like the cake you buy in a restaurant!  Only one person didn't care for it, saying it was 'too chocolatey.'  LOL!  I took someone's idea of using unsweetened cocoa powder to powder the bundt pan, instead of flour, and I didn't like that.  I could taste the cocoa powder in some bites.  Left a bitter taste in my mouth.  Next time I will use pam spray and flour.  I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe to frost it and then also used unsweetened applesauce in place of oil.  Will be making again this weekend for a dinner party!  Just love this heated up in the microwave for 20 seconds!

This is the first "doctored" cake recipe I've tried. It tasted great, very moist. If you use it to make a layer cake, beware; don't let it overbake, and be very careful when cutting the layers, the chocolate chips are like little rocks that must be dealt with delicately so as not to tear the cake layer. I layered mine with strawberry preserves and iced it with Rich Chocolate Frosting.

A little taste of this cake can take care of a chocolate fix really quick.  My son and I made this cake for his birthday.  He was more than pleased with the outcome.  We made this cake and used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe to top it off.  So wonderful!  Everyone loved it! However, I did have to change the recipe and "lighten" it up a bit.  I did what another reviewer suggested by exchanging veg oil for applesauce, sour cream for fat free, egg whites, and used fat free - sugar free pudding mix.  It tasted so sinful ... just a little healthier than the original.

Amazing!  My husband is a major chocoholic so this will be made a LOT!  I used mini chips to keep them from sinking and it worked great (half a bag was enough)!

Delicious! I was afraid to add the 1 cup of oil the recipe called for after reading other reviews, but I did and it turned out perfectly. Dusted with powdered sugar and served in a shallow bowl of milk.

This was absolutely AMAZING! I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil like other reviewers suggested (instead of the 1 cup) and if this had lasted more than 24 hours I would've eaten the whole thing.  FANTASTIC!

This is a awesome recipe that i have used over the years with great success. I also add 1/4 cup Kahlua and instead of two cups chocalate chips i only use one but also include 1 cup finely chopped pecans. My family and friends have enjoyed this version for years. Awesome Yummy Cake!!

I was designated to bake the cake for my sisters birthday party this year. She requested chocolate cake. I used miniature chocolate chips which made it even more moist and I used an 8 inch round cake pan instead of a bundt pan. It is amazing!! Very rich so have a glass of milk handy!

My daughter tried this recipe for our annual "hoedown" and baking contest.  She is 8yrs old and she was awarded a 2nd place ribbon for this wonderful cake. It was a great, easy to follow recipe for her and tastes amazing!

Very good - I used two round pans instead. I did overcook it a little, even with reducing the temp. But overall, a good recipe. It wasn't quite what I was looking for - it turned into a giant brownie after sitting in the fridge! Which wouldn't be so bad, I had just made it for my daughter's birthday and it didn't really come out like I hoped it would. Definitely good if you're not going for the traditional cake.

This cake is perfect!  I've made it a dozen times at least, I follow the recipe exactly as stated (except I put chocolate icing on it as well), and everyone always asks for the recipe.  In my oven, it needs exactly one hour to cook, and I would highly recommend greasing AND flouring the pan (or else the chocolate chips can burn making it difficult to remove).  It's not gooey at all, just moist and delicious.

Delicious. Made just as written. I probably should have cooked it a bit longer than 50 minutes though. I thought it was done but it fell apart upon trying to release from the bundt pan. We just put the big pieces of cake individual dishes and covered with whip cream and chocolate shavings. Yummy cake.

This is a great, dense cake which makes it perfect for decorating...especially for a wedding!  The first time I tried this I felt it tasted a little on the oily side, so I substituted 1/2c of melted butter for 1/2c of oil and that is a nicer flavor for me.  I also always add real vanilla to a box cake mix, because this cancels out the artificial vanilla that is used in mixes. You get less of a "cake mix" taste, and more of a homemade flair! I also used the mini chips like suggested by others.  Great to have this in your back pocket!!!

Wow!  I don't even like chocolate cake, but found myself taking slice after slice!  One of the best "doctored" cake mix recipes I have tried so far.  So moist and chocolatey it does not need frosting.  Also used the same recipe formula with yellow cake mix and pistacio pudding mix (and chocolate chips) and it turned out to be delicous!

Absolutely wonderful when it is warmed up and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.    It can also be done with sugar free cake mix and sugar free chips and it comes out really good!

My 4 year old son and I love to bake together.  I am always looking for easy recipes for him and I to do together.  This one is great!  We have used it twice to make cupcakes and ever time we do everyone raves about them.  I use the same recipe only cut the oil to 3/4 cup and 1 cup of mini chocolate chips,  cooking them at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  They go so fast that I have a hard time getting them frosted!!!

This cake is phenomenal!  I've made it twice in a week.  The first time I followed the recipe to the T.  It was delicious.  The second time I tried to cut calories by using sugar free pudding mix, light sour cream, and applesauce instead of the oil.  It turned out better.  It was more gooey and the chocolate didn't all blend.  It was delicious either way, but I'll make it with the calories cut from now on.  Great recipe!

Great cake..I made the light version with fat free sour cream, sugar free pudding mix and applesauce. It was Great! I also used the mini morsels. I think next time I'll use 1 cup instead of 2 to save even more calories. I think it will be just as good.

I am very surprised at the results I got from this cake.  I didn't even finish my piece.  I won't make this recipe again.  I'm sorry, but I made it according to directions, and there really was not anything special about this cake.  I'm very disappointed as I was looking forward to a 5 star recipe.  I think I would have enjoyed a batch of brownies much more.

Absolutely the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted, everyone who I've made it for agrees =) Thank you sooooo much! The only tweaking I've done is to melt the chocolate chips before mixing them in the batter, I found that evened out the finished product instead of having all of the chips sink to the bottom, which becomes the top.

I overheard my 18 year old daughter on the phone tonight.  She said "My Dad just made a 'Triple Chocolate Heart Attack Cake'.  Get over here.  You gotta have some".  The cooking time was about 10 minutes shy for my oven, but otherwise.....wow.  Garnish with fresh raspberries and a small scoop of French vanilla ice cream for a restaurant quality dessert.  The folks at the County Fair are right on the money.  Great job, Denise!!

Great cake. I used regular sized peanut butter chips in chocolate-flavored batter and pudding mix.. yummy!! The chips did NOT sink to the bottom as another reviewer experienced.. the cake batter is so thick that it suspends them in place. I overcooked this slightly - don't do it! When I stuck the fork in, I mistakingly took the melted candy chips for cake batter.. last note is that I served it with vanilla icecream and strawberries - mmMMMM!!!

This cake is amazing!  I haven't needed to change anything in the recipe; and it is now my "go to" dessert when asked to bring something to a get together.  I tried using the mini chips like some suggested, and they still fell to the bottom.  However, when I used chocolate chips just out of the fridge they did not sink...something to do with them being super cold?  Also, I accidentally bought sugar free instant pudding, and it didn't change the taste at all, so I will continue to cut some of the sugar by using the sugar free pudding.

Super Yum!  Also, for those that have difficult with the chocolate chips sinking to the bottom: dust the chocolate chips with flour before putting them in the batter.

it was very chocolaty and i didnt even  put in all of the pudding, i also made the mistake of baking it wrong becaue the top and sides were way to crispy and it wasnt that moist except for the very middle i think it def was because i baked it wrong i will def make it again but add the right amount of pudding (which was low fat no sugar) PAY ATTENTION TO HOW YOU BAKE IT OR ITLL END LIKE MINE =(

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!  This is the BEST chocolate cake ever - A chocolate lovers dream come true.  Followed recipe exactly as posted, only slight change was using mini chocolate chips.  This will become my standard chocolate cake for everything - Thanks for posting such a wonderful and easy recipe.

This was great!  I wasn't wanting to make it at first, because I wanted to make a homemade cake--not the box stuff.  But this didn't taste anything like the boxes, and was probably one of the best chocolate cakes I've made.  Very very moist, and great with the chocolate chips too, though you could probably leave them out if you didn't have any and it would still taste fine.  I made mine in two 8 or 9 inch cake pans, and frosted with a nice thick chocolate frosting.  Not only did it turn out great, but it was quick and easy too!!!

We made this cake the low-fat way, using applesauce instead of oil, 8 egg whites, sugar-free pudding, & fat-free sour cream and it tastes GREAT!!  I can only imagine what the true recipe would taste like!  :)

This is it.... wonderful... and I didn't even use the choc chips... i forgot...  and I made it with dark choc fudge and followed the other reviews about the milk and 1/2 the oil... baked it at 335... rubbed butter to grease the pan and it just popped onto the plate with no effort... and it tastes....oh.... so.... gooood. Thanks for the great base recipe.

Not a huge fan of this. I thought I would be but it just wasn't moist enough for me. I usually use Cherrybrook Kitchen's Chocolate Cake Mix and I love that it's moist and very chocolaty but this recipe just didn't deliver that same rich, chocolate goodness like I'd hoped. It could have been just me though. I'll try this recipe again in the future and repost.

Hands down, the best cake ever.  I took it to a 4th of July cookout, and they devoured it up immediately.  I tried the mini chocolate chips like someone else mentioned, and will keep using those!!!!

The first time I made this, I made cupcakes. I didn't have time to get them to friends the day I baked them, but even two days later they were still moist and delicious. Everyone said they were the best cupcakes they'd ever eaten! I used mini chocolate chips in that batch. The second time I baked them, I tried melting the chips and adding them...needless to say, TERRIBLE idea! I completely forgot that there was pudding mix in the batter and of course, they gelled up and made the cupcakes very dry and hard. I guess it's good to learn from your mistakes!

This cake is awesome!! I followed the recipe without making any changes. Well, the only thing I did was to toss the chocolate chips in a little bit of flour before adding them to the batter. This prevents the chips from sinking to the bottom, like some people have noted. I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site to pour over the cake and then dusted the top with powdered sugar. For the glaze, if you don't have corn syrup, I just used 1 tbsp white sugar and 1/4 tbsp water instead. It turned out just fine! My husband said it looked store-bought and my brother-in-law asked to take some home for later. Since my oven is so old and unreliable, I did have to bake it for about 15 minutes longer than stated. Excellent recipe and I'll definitely make this again!

I made this in a 9x13 pan and I left out the choc chips (didn't have any on hand) and subbed 1/2 cup of coffee for the water. WOW This was so moist and rich...I made it 4 days ago and it sat loosely covered with foil on top of my microwave. Ate the last piece today and it was still awesome. Didn't even frost it!!! as my sweets LOVING bf said it didn't need it...

Very good.  Very, very chocolaty--almost too much chocolate if that is even possible.  Very rich and dense.  Great for pms or recession blues.

AMAZING! I followed this recipe exactly and used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site on top. Then I sprinkled powdered sugar and more chocolate chips on top and it was to die for! It is now my boyfriend's favorite cake! I even used sugar free pudding and fat free sour cream and it still tasted great!

This turned out very moist and rich! I'm not a chocolate cake fan  but this is delicious!  I used a bundt pan and my sides did get a little crispy but i think i either let it cook too long or should have turned the oven down!  Will be a keeper for  my chocolate cake recipe!

Fabulous recipe!  I had never made a bundt cake before, and I wanted to make one for my upcoming birthday. I made this over the weekend for a party and everyone loved it.  It was very moist (not too much, just right) and chocolatey. Wouldn't change a thing.  And yes, I am making this again for my birthday - I had so many requests I just couldn't refuse :) Two thumbs up!    NOTE: I did not make the Satiny Chocolate Glaze for this cake. Instead, I sprinkled the top with powdered sugar.  It presented beautifully just the same. :)

This is an amazing cake - I made it for our son's birthday and everyone loved it - hardly a piece left for him to take home.  I used strong coffee in place of the water and 1/2 cup of oil, baked it in a 9x13 panfor approx. 40-45 mins. at 350 degrees. I'm going to try some of the other combinations suggested, but for chocolate lovers this is a keeper.  I used bittersweet chips that I tossed with a teaspoon of flour before mixing into the batter - the chips don't sink to the bottom, this is a tip I got years ago and it works every time.

Tasted like a mix. Won't make again.  From-scratch may be a bit more trouble but is well worth it.  Okay, I lied, I did try making this again.  Still not worth the time or money.

I make this cake on a regular basis at the restaurant i work for. I sometimes substitute the sour cream for buttermilk and it still turns out fabulous. And of course, can't have chocolate cake without the chocolate frosting. It is a favorite in my recipe collection.

Excellent!  Disagree that it's too oily - it's perfect.  Also second the idea on mini chocolate chips so that they are able to melt.  Will definitely make this over and over again b/c it's so simple and wonderfully moist.

I have made this a few times in the last month and get rave reviews every time. To make it a little "lighter" I use sugar free pudding, replace 1/2 cup oil with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, and use low fat sour cream or plain yogurt. Topped with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site and you have a dense, rich awesome treat! The favorite flavor combinations have been Devils food cake/chocolate pudding/peanut butter chips followed by Chocolate cake (+2 tsp peppermint extract)/chocolate pudding/mint chocolate chips.

You would think this was my first time baking - I completely forgot the oil, I made an absolute mess of my hand mixer since the batter was so thick (due to the lack of oil), I accidentally turned ON the hand mixer while trying to scrape the overly thick batter off the beaters -flinging cake batter everywhere!  I burnt both hands... I'm surprised I didn't burn my house down too -it obviously wasn't a baking day -maybe I can blame it all on me being 39 weeks prego!  At the end of it all, the cake was still surprisingly moist!  I used fat-free sour cream and sugar-free pudding and covered the cake in Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  Next time I'll use 1c of mini chocolate chips instead of the 2c regular (since they did sink) and, of course, the oil called for in the recipe.

I made this cake on mother's Day.  My mother (who is a chocoholic) and my mother-in-law LOVED it. I did add the satiny glaze from this web site. I served it with strawberries and whip cream.  Everyone Loved it, my son wanted to claim the entire cake as his.

This is my and my whole family's favorite cake now.  I didn't have to make any changes to the cake and it's great.  For frosting try it with the coffee butter frosting, also on allrecipes.  I just tried it with whipped cream cheese frosting for my nephews cake and everyone went nuts over the cake.  It was that good.  Seriously, the moist chocolaty cake combined with the extra light and fluffy frosting with a hint of cream cheese.  SOOOO good!  If you do try the frosting cut the sugar to by a 1/4 cup.

The chocolate lovers in the family loved this!  The only change I made was for the oil I did half unsweetened applesauce, half canola oil.  Delicious!  I will make this again!

This is an awesome chocolate cake!  Followed the recipe (which was so easy) and it turned out incredible.  Very moist, just the way I like it. I will be making this recipe many more times in the future.

This cake is over the top!  I get into big trouble at work if I don't bring this on pot-luck day, lol.  My kids devour it as soon as I get it out of the pan, thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This is the BEST chocolate cake recipe. I can see why it won awards!! I overcooked it a little, I'm never any good at judging bundt cakes but it still was extremly moist. The best part are the melted chocolate chips in the cake. I made a chocolate glaze to go over the top and served with chocolate covered strawberries. It was a hit at Easter.

Wonderful idea of adding Chocolate pudding into cake.Imagine ,I didnt use cake mix ,sour cream.Prepared it from scratch like regular chocolate cake but replaced half of oil with 200 gms of chocolate pudding.and even cut down on sugar as well  . I have never eaten a better cake in my life which had this level of moisture ,sweetness and this less calories almost minimum 90 calories less than a regular cake per serving by replacing oil with pudding and better taste on the top of it. Thanks a lot for it.

My hubby and the other firefighters raved about this cake. I topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze..I did everything the recipe except I greased my pan, then sprayed with Pam, then dusted with dry cocoa- That way it didnt have the whitish stuff on the outside. VERY good cake!!!!!

This was probably the BEST chocolate cake from a mix cake I have ever had! Very moist and the chocolate flavor was incredible! Melted store bought icing in the microwave and drizzled over the top, added fresh strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream. Everyone loved it.

I used this recipe to make a layered cake instead of a bundt cake, which gave me 3 9" layers. I just finished Course 1 of Wilton Cake Decorating classes and I made this cake specifically for that. After I had decorated it and my picture was taken with it, my instructor and classmates were all dying for the recipe after having a small slice. I don't know if I would make this on a regular basis for my future classes, but if you're craving chocolate, this is the cake to make!

So... I made this cake twice in a week and it was gobbled up by my boyfriend and their friends. It's TOO GOOD! Very moist but not heavy. Not overly sweet either, which surprised me because of the chocolate chips on top of the cake mix. For a glaze I made a simple ganache: 1/2 cup heavy cream, 3/4 cup bittersweet chocolate. Bring the cream to a boil then immediately pour over chopped chocolate and stir until completely incorporated and shiny. This one is definitely going into the recipe book!

I normally don't like chocolate cake because it is spongy and doesn't taste like rich chocolate.  This cake was incredible.  Definitely on my list to make a lot!

This was really good for a chocolate fix, and easy to make.  Would love to try it with ground chili pepper to give it a kick.  The only downside are the artificial ingredients in the cake/pudding mixes.  Bummer.

Really don't see what all the fuss is for.  It's good, but it wasn't spectacular or anything...  Didn't win me anything at my bake-off :-(  But still, a nice enough cake for a like a church pot luck or something.

This is the easiest cake to make, and it tastes amazing! I made it for my husband for his birthday, and now it's a birthday tradition. I did not have to make any adjustments. Just make it like it is, and enjoy!!! I use the frosting from the Extreme chocolate Cake recipe on this site.

I hate to be the odd one out, but this did not work for me.  I was super excited to try this because I'm a big fan of box cake mixes and assumed since this started w/that as its base, it would be like a box cake, only BETTER.  Um, not so much.  I tried one fresh out of the oven (un-frosted) and was underwhelmed...so, I thought I'd reserve judgement until they were frosted...still underwhelmed, so I thought I'd see the guests (made them for a baby shower) reactions....still underwhelmed (they thought they were brownies!), so I tried them after a couple of drinks, STILL underwhelmed (and if a chocolate cupcake doesn't taste great after a few drinks when you're starving, it never will)...  I followed the recipe to a *T* (other than baking in cupcakes, rather than a bundt pan)...my batter was very thick and my cupcakes had very little taste, less than a traditional box mix chocolate cake.  I won't be making again, but hundreds of other people can't be wrong, so def try it for yourself!

I cut the oil down to 1/2c and I added extra warm water to get a good consistency. The recipe made 12 cupcakes & 1 round cake pan (w/ bundt piece inserted)... I baked the cupcakes for 16 minutes & they were perfect! Just make sure you do not fill past the 1/2 way mark because this recipe nearly doubles in size once baked. I made the cupcakes in oversized Nut & Party cups (from Wilton) & we ate them warm- it tasted like a molton lava cake w/ the melted chocolate chips! Yummy!! And unlike most cakes, this gets better the day after. It was so moist & it reminded me of a chocolate muffin from Costco! Mmmm this is my new go-to recipe for chocolate cake.

AMAZING recipe.  Followed exactly.  Topped with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site, and paired with sliced strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Delicious.  Everyone told me to save this recipe and make it again!

Definitely worth 5 stars!  I followed the suggestions of others and decreased the oil to 3/4 cup but kept everything else the same.  Baked for 53 minutes and it was perfect!  Also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe.  Served to guests with vanilla ice cream about 10 hours after baking and it was incredibly moist and flavorful.  Delish!

I aboslutely love this cake.  I have made it several times for my husband and myself, and more recently for my mother over the Christmas holidays. I always make the recipe with the exact same ingrediants only with mini chocolate chips though.  It is a great way to have a piece of chocolate in every mouth-watering bite.  I don't even need to add icing.  I just dust it with powdered sugar and it contrasts beautifully with the dark chocolate color. Delish!

YUM!!!!! I made this cake for my father-in-law's birthday and it as absolutely decadent. I would use mini chocolate chips next time, because they sank, but otherwise no change. Be aware that the batter will look VERY different than a typical cake mix - waxy, whipped, solid - but resist the temptation to doctor it! Comes out perfect, moist, just the right amount of density - YUM! I topped it with the "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" from this site. A+!

This cake is delish, I topped it wth satiny chocolate glaze like a lot of people suggested and that was perfect.  The best part is it is not to sweet

It is 2 hours before my baby's Dr. appointment, and I am extremely disappointed with the results.  I decided to bake something nice for the Dr. and staff for the holidays, and thought this would be a no brainer with its rave reviews.  I made two 8 inch square cakes, and I ended up eating a quarter of the one pan trying to debate if I should bother taking it to the Dr or not.  It IS denser than the cake box mix, but that's all the difference I taste.  Maybe I'll just make the Satiny chocolate glaze and give it in so I don't waste it, but what a disappointment!  UPDATE:  I originally gave this a 1 star, but had to change it to 4.  With the left over, my toddler couldn't get enough of it (he doesn't really like too much sweets believe it or not...maybe the "bittersweet" chocolate chips made it more palatable for him).  My 6 year old nephew cried "THIS IS THE BEST BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER! THIS IS BETTER THAN MY MOM'S!!"  Even my sister exclaimed what a great, rich cake this was.  Hmm, perhaps it's just a personal taste preference (thus the 4 star) but I'm glad I ended up giving the other cake to the Doctor and staff.

Tried this recipe and used fat free sour creme and 6 serving sugar fat free chocolate pudding mix since I was unsure what size pudding mix called for in the recipe matched what I had on hand.  This chocolate cake was absolutely wonderful  I too used the chocolate satiny glaze and topped with chopped almonds on top of the cake.  Wonderful recipe and will be my new desert to bring to friend's house. Thanks!

I made this for my husbands 40th bday yesterday. It was so easy and so yummy. I baked it in 2 9inch deep round cake pans. It baked up very fluffy. The frosting i used was a chocolate butter cream and put kisses around the top. It was by far the best cake i have made in a long time.

I cut slices of this cake for my teenage sons and their friend.  Before I could even cut myself a slice, they were already asking for seconds.  I looked and all of their plates were clean.  I made this cake exactly as directed and it was a big hit!!!!  :)

Oh my goodness... if you love chocolate this recipe is most definitely for you. It was incredibly moist and rich. It is probably the simplest chocolate cake you can make with such phenomenol results. I ended up using chocolate fudge cake mix and the chocolate fudge pudding, but thats simply because I'm not a huge fan of devil's food cake. It turned out better than I might have thought. I put a simple chocolate glaze on it because I wasn't sure if it would need a topping and after trying it I now know that it most certainly could have been just as good without the glaze. The one questionable thing that I ran into making this cake is the pudding package. I could only find packages that were 3.9 ounces and the recipes states that it needs a 5.9 ounce package. To resolve that I simple bought two and used one and then approximately one half of the other one. Since the cake was amazing I imagine that that worked out well.

Okay, I have to admit that I felt a little guilty baking a "doctored" cake mix, but if 848 other allrecipe bakers loved it, I knew I couldn't go wrong. It couldn't be easier and it was totally choco-licious, especially topped off with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze!! As suggested, I used the Mini Morsels and it distributed the chocolate chips evenly throughout the cake. This recipe's a keeper...especially for a true chocoholic!

Made this exactly as written...for a quick and simple recipe, I thought it was great and my boyfriend, who loves cake and chocolate, thought it was out of this world.  Made the chocolate bundt cake glaze recipe (also quick and simple) from this site to go on top of the cake...a perfect match if you are looking for a truly "too much chocolate cake!"

I'm sorry.  I don't get it.
I have cooked all of my life and was so excited to find such a high review on one of my favorite desserts.  I was excited to see such an easily prepared cake with such rave comments.  Don't believe the hype.  For a little bit more effort on a true scratch recipe, you'll reap way more benefit.  It was too much.

Be sure you grease the pan VERY well! The top of my cake got stuck in the bundt, so the end result didn't look very pretty.  I made this together with the Dark Chocolate Cake II from this site and my guests didn't like this one as much as they liked the other one.  It is very easy to make, however, and I would definitely consider baking it for informal parties.

I made this recipe into chocolate cupcakes and at first I was concerned at the consistency of the batter. However, I did use other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 c. oil, 1/3 c. milk, and 1 c. mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. The first batch that I made I took them out of the oven too soon (after 15-17 mins) and the tops collapsed. So the second batch I left in for 19-22 mins and they turned out perfect. However, take my advice and do not eat them until the next day....they are amazing!!!

I made this for the teachers at school.  So I could taste it before sending it, I made 4 mini muffins.  It was very good.  I made peanut butter frosting and topped with reese cups and mini chips.  I did use mini chips also in the cake, like another reviewer suggested.  I can not wait to make again for home and serve warm with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream.  The teachers loved it!! Great cake!  Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful!  My first try I used someone's suggestion to decrease oil by half and add 1/3 cup of milk.  It came out perfect.  I've made it twice now and it was a huge hit both times!

I could live on chocolate, really, but this cake gave me a run for my money.  Very rich and delicious.  I also made "easy chocolate bundt cake glaze" and was incredible.  Not the healthiest, of course, but it does chocolate cake right.

Outstanding.  Moist and perfectly chocolately.  Definitely use the previous tips-- cut to 1/2 cup of oil, add 1/3 cup of milk, use mini-chips and cut that to 1-1/4 cups.  I dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled some fudge sauce over it just for appearance, but it would've been equally good as is!

This is THE BEST cake recipe I now have!
I know it by heart, and don't change a thing.  Perfection.  I make it in a Bundt pan, and sprinkle confectioner's sugar on the top.  Absolutely perfect!

I love that it's ready to pop in the oven by the time the oven is preheated.
Thanks for sharing.

I wish I could give this cake more stars!  I followed the recipe exactly as written (except I used low fat sour cream out of habit- I don't think it mattered).  It turned out beautifully and it was super quick and easy.  I'm actually hesitant to frost it, even though I had planned to.  I'll be serving it at a 30th birthday party tonight and I'm already anticipating many requests for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

I think this must have been very good cake, but I wouldn't know because it disappeared within 15 minutes of putting it on the table for a meeting and all I experienced was what I scraped off the plate I brought it on.  Everybody loved it.  I wish I could have gotten a picture.  I made half a recipe for Pro Ganache (recipe on this site) for icing, trimmed the bottom edge with raspberries and filled the center to overflowing with more raspberries and added a few squiggles of white decorating icing.  It made a beautiful cake.

I've made this cake for years, with a slight twist - mix small pkg. instant choc. pudding with 3/4 c milk; blend in devil's food cake mix and 2 eggs; stir in 12 oz choc. chips - bake 45-50 min in greased bundt. Seems healthier as there's no sour cream or oil and it gets RAVES when I take it to new moms, etc. Honestly, every time I make it (twice a month?) I am asked for the recipe, and am embarassed for folks to see how easy it is : ) We call it Triple Chocolate Cake - I buy choc chips in bulk at Sam's and stay stocked up on cake and pudding mix so I can knock this out in a jiffy.

This cake is totally delicious! I made it for a co workers birthday and recieved rave reviews!! It only took five minute to mix up- the oven took longer to pre heat!! I would highly reccomend this.  I made the same changes as other by decreasing the oil to 1/2. C and adding a 1/3 c. of milk.  I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  Enjoy!!

Great cake. I made it in two nine inch pans and layered it with some filling in between. My only advice would be to make it a day early and refrigerate it over night. It tasted much better cold.

I JUST made this cake today along with a glaze from this site.  I can't have sugar but the birthday boy and guests absolutely loved it.  I did a couple things different.  I did only use 3/4 C oil and with the regular chips I used only 1 1/2 C.  I also made it in two 9" cake pans instead of the bundt pan. I put some glaze on the first layer and then made a layer of cut raspberries on that.  I then put the second layer of cake on the top of that, frosted the top of the cake with the glaze and let the remainder of glaze ooze down the sides.  When completely done, I took 6 raspberries and put them in two little areas of three each for decoration.

Excellent cake! Everyone thought I bought it. I also used the satiny choc glaze & then garnished it w/white choc covered strawberries. Delicious!

I love this cake!
I had the "Big Fat Chocolate Cake" at a resort once, and I was looking for something similar. Got it! 
This stayed really moist and was even better the second day. 
I made a chocolate icing out of chocolate chips, powdered sugar, and milk and slapped it between and on top of two circle cakes. I also made some raspberry puree by blending frozen raspberries and a little sugar and then straining it. The  cake with its fruitiness was delicious.
This is my favorite cake ever!

WOW!!!  This was incredible.  I topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze as suggested by the other reviewers and ate almost all of it myself.  I probably gained 5 pounds because of it, but it was worth every bite!

This is the perfect chocolate cake recipe! I personally prefer doctored cake mixes. My scratch cakes just never come out that great. This cake is so delicious. It doesn't even need icing. I used mini chocolate chips in this cake and they were perfect. I definitely recommend this one!

OK, I had a small pkg. of pudding instead of the large but the cake mix already had some in it--I don't think they sell the old (pudding-less) kind anymore. Everything else according to recipe--quite ordinary. I agree with another poster about dolled up cake mix recipes-they always dissapoint. It doesn't take that much xtra effort to make one from scratch and the results are ALWAYS worth it.

My daughter just had her 6th birthday. What little girl does not like chocolate? I made this for her cake, I used two 9inch cake pans and used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe in the middle and on top. It was fab! Everyone in the family LOVED it.   This is the recipe for the glaze: Satiny Chocolate Glaze

You either LOVE this cake or HATE this cake. If you love a dark bittersweet chocolate this is great. If you love sweet milk chocolate this is NOT for you. I used the Chocolate Ganache  frosting recipe. Like I said everyone who tried it either loved it or hated it so I am giving it 4 stars for those who loved it. 
PS I did not have a bundt pan so I used a 9X12 and it came out fine.

I used the basic recipe but changed it up a little. My changes produced an Instant Mocha Fudge Layer cake. Here's what I did. First of all I used 2-8" round cake pans instead of the bundt. I greased them and used cocoa to dust them with. To the warm water I added 1 well rounded tablespoon of instant coffee granules. I also added 2 teaspoons of real almond extract. I took the advice of others and used the mini morsels. That way there weren't large chunks of chocolate in the cake. Since I didn't have enough confectioners sugar to make my own frosting, I used some Dunkin Hines whipped chocolate frosting that I already had. I mixed 2 teaspoons of instant coffee granules in a little bit of warm milk and mixed it in the frosting.  This cake was very moist and each layer baked up nicely. My family loved it and I'll definitely be making it again. Thanks for the recipe!!

As a cake decorator, I use this recipe a lot for my fondant and/or gum paste creations which can be too heavy for other types of cakes, and this cake holds up very well. I have had nothing but rave flavor reviews each time I have served it. I love the fact that I rarely have to level the cake. I use only mini chocolate chips based on another review. My only issue is that the mini chips do not fully melt and so everyone knows there are chips inside, and of course they "crunch"...just a personal pet peeve.

I followed the directions exactly and I didn't really care for the cake - I was so disappointed after reading the great reviews.  It tasted like a doctored up box cake to me and my guests didn't rave about it.  Next time I will look for a new chocolate cake recipe.

I took this to a party and didn't actually get to try any but the reactions I got are good enough for "10" stars. I also cut the oil down to about 3/4 cup I can't image putting in more, that almost seems too much. I used mini chocolate chips drizzled the cake with chocolate gauche, then melted peanut butter chips to drizzle stripes. It looked fantastic and I wished could have given it a taste but I was pretty happy with the compliments!

A lot like a thick decadent brownie - and very very addicting!  I iced with cream cheese icing and it was so bad for me - so you know it was good!  :)  I think I will go have some more now...

It's good when you want something quick and don't feel like baking a scratch cake.  Added a can of chocolate frosting I had on hand.  Will probably bake again when I get another sweet tooth.

I changed things just a bit: Pillsbury DARK chocolate cake mix (with pudding in the mix), SMALL box of chocolate FUDGE pudding, 1 cup VANILLA YOGURT, 1/2 cup of STRONG COFFEE, and the MINI-CHOCOLATE CHIPS someone suggested.

OMGoodness!!  THE best cake I have ever eaten.  I can't stop baking and eating it.  My favorite is serving it with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.

I am going to try this recipe with a lemon cake mix and lemon pudding, lemon yogurt, and lemonaide for the liquid.
I'll also try subbing toffee bits for the chocolate chips.

Can't wait!

UPDATE 9-20011: I have since made this cake a million times in a million different versions and have ALWAYS gotten rave reviews. The most recent was using this as a small sheet cake at my parents' 40th wedding anniversary celebration. It worked fantastic - moist and very tasty cake. I did one chocolate, one white, and one marble. I used white chocolate pudding, white cake mix, and milk for the white one and no chocolate chips.

This cake deserves a 5 star rating. I can't believe that this is from a cake mix. It's so very moist and the chocolate chips are a wonderful addition, especially when eaten a little warm. Very easy to make and baked up nice and tall but not over the pan. It even tastes great the next day (if there are any leftovers!). Loved this one. Will be making it again & again.

I made this as a sheet cake in a 13 x 9 (?) pan and baked it for 35 minutes at 350. I also first beat the eggs using my Kitchen Aide mixer, added the sour cream, oil, and water and mixed these ingredients thoroughly before adding the box of pudding and cake mix. When I added the dry mixes, I only mixed until thoroughly blended, then added the chocolate chips. I sprayed my cake pan well with Pam, then poured cake batter into pan and baked in lower third of the oven for 35 minutes. I checked with a toothpick as well as testing for doneness by touching the top of the cake and watched for it to bounce back. When cooled for about an hour, I topped with the satiny chocolate glaze to complete this wonderful cake. 
Soooo easy and seemingly foolproof. Everyone loves this cake!

I'm not a huge chocolate lover, but this is an awesome recipe.  I'm not even really sure how anyone's cake couldn't come out, even with varying the recipe a bit.  I used a cake mix that was only 15oz, compared to the 18.25oz called for.  I used sugar free pudding mix and didn't use the full 5.9oz that was called for.  I used a bit less than 1C of sour cream and my cake STILL came out perfect!

I also used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe found on this site, paired w/fresh strawberries.  I did use larger choco-chips, but chopped them in my chopper to spread the chocolatey-goodness.

This is my new go-to dessert, and I'll be trying this recipe w/ different mixes and pudding combos.  Next up:  strawberry cake, banana cream pudding and white chocolate chips.

This is always a winner!  Have made it numerous times and people always ask for the recipe.  Super easy to make.  In my opinion, however, it only gets better and moister the longer it sits...if it lasts that long.  We are down to the last piece (made it 5 days ago) and it's even better than it was the first 4 days.  I used a chocolate glaze recipe on this site this time (choc. chips, Karo syrup, vanilla), but it really doesn't need frosting at all, and i've made it many times with just the powdered sugar - or nothing - on top.

I made this cake this past weekend and I have to say this cake was unbelievable!!  My guests LOVED it as did my own family.  This has become my new favorite cake and the only thing I did differently is I added a half a cup of Godiva chocolate liquer to the recipe.  This cake melts in your mouth.  If you're looking for a great chcolate cake recipe-LOOK NO FURTHER!!

hello cake! I'm never going back to just making cake from a box again! my only complaint is that I frosted mine with a chocolate cream cheese frosting and it made it too chocolaty. Next time I am going to frost with just a simple cream cheese and powdered sugar frosting. Regardless the cake was gone in a week and my sister kept coming over to sneak slices. soooo good!

Outstanding chocolate cake!!  Very easy, in fact my two daughters ages 12 & 14 made it and I supervised.  It is just to die for.  I used Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site with it.  A keeper combination!  I beg to differ though... there is no such thing as Too Much Chocolate!  :D

This is the perfect chocolate cake just as directed, with these warm, bursting pockets of semi melted chocolate (the chips) that surprise you in each bite.  Try this for a special occasion (we did for my sister's birthday), and you will not be disappointed.  It's even better the next day warmed for a few secs in the microwave.  Note - do not go for this cake if you're obsessed with finding a fudgey chocolate cake (I know I do that sometimes!)...this is chocolatey, not fudgey.  Enjoy!

I prefer to beat up the liquid ingredients before adding into the dry ingredients. My husband is not a cake lover n not font of chocolate cake. This is the only recipe that he actually requested me to bake again. Sometimes he search the fridge late night for leftover. My kids also repeat order for this cake too. Already baked few times within 2 months since discovered it. The only downside is the calories n fat loading.

after reading the reviews, I was dissapointed. I love chocolate, but this cake was a little much. I added some light cream cheese frosting, and some strawberries on top to change up the flavors some, and it helped, but still not something that I would make again.
I didn't have any problem with the cake falling apart, it turned out beutifull, and very moist, but the flavor just didn't do it for me.

Wow- what a cake! Easy to prep too! I baked in the evening (using mini chocolate chips, which worked wonders), allowed the cake to cool overnight in the bundt pan, and lightly placed a piece of plastic wrap over the top. I believe this helps to lock in the moisture better. The cake came out perfectly in the morning. I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site to drizzle over the top (yum). The inside was nice and moist and the edges were a little crispy (as recipe says). I think next time I will bake for less time, as the moist texture is one to be enjoyed. Overall, a very tasty (and chocolaty) cake!

I ditto all the wonderful comments!  It is easy, it is yummy and gets rave reviews.  I have all the ingredients stocked in my pantry for a quick treat, company or whatever occasion may sneak up on us.  So moist and chocolatey, it doesn't need any icing at all.  Just a big glass of milk!  I will definitely try some variations as suggested.

This is my secret cake weapon. No one will know what hit them until they taste it... something like that. It is VERY moist and dense. I love the flavor, and I'm not a chocolate cake person. I agree with a few other reviewers here saying that using mini chocolate chips works better. I have tried the regular size chips, and if thats all you have in your pantry, than it will work. You might find that its a little too melty and it falls apart easily. Everyone will love this cake!

I saw this & thought that it looked good...I was right. What a great cake...no need to make frosting. My girls said that they want it as their birthday cake this year, which says a lot. 
I did change a few things though: 
1.5 Cups of chips rather than the 2 & I used a 3.9 oz box of pudding rather than the larger size. I also baked it in a 13x9 & i'm having a tough time staying away from it.

I had a bunch of gals over for a craft event and made this quick cake...and holey freakin' heck!  This cake ROCKS!  Everyone went crazy for it claimed it was the BEST chocolate cake they've ever had.  (I just dusted with icing sugar and garnished with a strawberry).  Everyone went home with the recipe....

People fight over this at my place of work. Make sure that you test the cake with a knife before bringing it out. It wont really come out completely clean...that the nature of this doctor'ed cake recipe. I find that this recipe takes a little longer in the oven (well in my crappy oven anyway) Just wait til your knife comes out mostly clean and youll be happy.

This is an excellent cake.  I only gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because I didn't think it was super chocolatey.  It is a super moist cake.  I did reduce the oil to 2/3 cup and put in mini chips as others had suggested.  I also made the glaze but microwaving a canned (plastic can) super chocolate frosting.  Delish!

This recipe was great and easy to make. I added a little more water because the batter was a little bit thick. I also made sure to check the cake before taking it out to make sure the inside was done. I used the satin glaze and topped it with chocolate covered strawberries.

After reading other reviews I baked this 1 day early to allow it to rest.  The cake was very moist.  My family liked it, but they prefer a more rich cake with buttercream frosting.  I used the choc. satin glaze.  Overall,Good, but not rich enough for the choc-o-holic.  It did present well though.

I made this the other day for the company chocolate cook-off.  I must say that it is a very pretty cake.  I served it on a black and white platter, dusted it with powdered sugar and placed cherries all around it.  However, I was not impressed with the taste.  As matter of fact, it was the last thing touched on the table.  More people scraped the cherries off of the plate to eat then eating the cake itself.  I thought it was rather expensive to make for no better than it tasted.  I won't make it again.

Wow!  I made this for my chocolate-loving father-in-law for his birthday and he loved it!  It is so rich and so chocolatey.  Next time I think I will use a silicone bundt pan, because it took forever to cool down enough to invert.  UPDATE:  Do NOT use the silicone bundt pan - it cooled too quickly and I think the cake didn't turn out as well.  But definetely use the mini chocolate chips!  Thye completely melted and made the cake just super rich and moist.  It was a total hit at our holiday potluck!

I made this for my son's birthday.  Very rich chocolate flavor.  Used the recipe as is except I used mini chocolate chips. I drizzled Satiny Chocolate Glaze and served with fresh raspberries which complimented everything well.  Everyone raved.

This cake is fantastic. I have made it about 6 times in the last year, it's really easy and just tastes so good. I top it with Caroline's chocolate fudge frosting from this site and my entire family just gobbles it up. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is by far the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever come across.  I get requests to make it for parties and birthdays all the time. I top with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze to finish it off. So easy to make.

I was disappointed in this cake- I was looking for a richer flavour, but it just tasted like a cheap chocolate cake. My boyfriend said it tasted exactly like the Costco chocolate muffins, and I had to admit he was right.

This cake does not taste at all like a mix is used. It is so easy to make, too. My 13 year-old granddaughter baked it at our house when spending the night. Her mother had been baking a cake that was supposedly the "best" chocolate cake. However, everyone agrees this one "takes the cake!" I have made this several times. The only thing I have changed is I use mini chocolate chips. They don't sink to the bottom as the larger ones sometimes do. We also prefer a chocolate icing on it, but when in a hurry the confectioner's sugar is good. Great recipe--thanks!

A keeper for sure!  A couple of substitutions made it more healthy and the taste was still wonderful.  We used lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream and used 3/4 cup applesauce + 1/4 cup oil instead of 1 cup oil.  I also used a package of peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. The Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site (thanks for the suggestions, everybody!) made this cake over the top.

TO DIE FOR!!!!! This cake is wonderfully chocolately & moist!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and it turned out fantastic.  I drizzled chocolate ganache over the top, which made it extra ymuuy, but it would have been delicious without as well.  This one is definitely a keeper!!

Sure this cake was good, no denying that.  But something you MUST be aware of is the fact that despite the dressing up, it still tastes like it came out of a box.  Now if you have no problems with boxed cake mix... you're golden.  But if you are desperately trying to avoid the "from scratch" labor but wanting the "from scratch" taste... I'm afraid your efforts will be in vain.  You won't be able to pass this off as completely homemade to any discerning eater.

My 7 yr old daughter made this. I frosted it and added the strawberries. The ready-made frosting came in the Devil's food cake packet mix. So easy and really decadent. She only used a wooden spoon to stir all the ingredients and we used a 3/4 pack of chopped dark chocolate because that's all we had. Hubby said, "It's one of the best." See photo.

Tasted a little to much like a boxed cake mix.  Easy to make, though, and it is a step up from a mix.

This was a wonderful and extremely simple chocolate cake recipe. It was beautiful for my moms birthday and it received rave reviews! However I wanted to cut back on the calories (even though its a cake 600c is a bunch!!!) so I used plain fat free yogurt for the sour cream and instead of using oil I used applesauce. It was perfect!

My first attempt of this cake a year or so ago was a failure, I didnt cook it long enough I guess but it was eaten and enjoyed. I decided to try it again for a pregnant friend of mine who is coming for dinner. After buying all the ingredients I come home to see I dont have oil..so I use the little bit I have left, about 1/4C..added 1/4C applesauce, then topped it off with a 1/2C of 1% milk. Also use low-fat sour cream. I used 1C of chopped chocolate chips, and save the other cup for the glaze. I cooked mine at 325 for 75 minutes, it wasn't jiggly when I took it out..I didnt want another collapse haha seriously teh most moist cake i've ever eaten, everyone commented on that and how delicious it was, pieces were taken home! Will stick to cooking it this way from now on!

This cake was very well liked by everyone. I only used 1/2 the amount of oil and used non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream and it was plenty moist!

Beyond 5 stars...simple, perfect, stays moist for days, delicious, delicious, delicious.  Being the young'un at my office I was nervous about bringing a cake to a potluck (these ladies are SERIOUS about their cooking) but I got endless compliments and requests for the recipe.  Thanks so very much for sharing!!

The best cake I have ever tasted! SO easy too!
I added one and a half cups of choc chips as it is very rich and topped it with berries.

I used this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday last week and it went over fantastic! I actually forgot to put the chocolate chips in, but they wound up being un-needed. Also made it in a traditional round springform instead of bundt. The cake was dense, chocolately, and very very moist, something everyone commented on. Friends of ours who are engaged even said the cake was better than those they had sampled for their upcoming wedding! Will definitely be making this again.

One of the best chocolate cakes I have ever made! I used less chocolate chips because I didn't want the chocolate chips to be overpowering. But that was just my personal opinion.

I made this for work.  It's very chocolatey so it's a big hit with the real chocolate lovers.  I would recommend not using the cake mix that has 'pudding in the mix'.

Fantastic recipe. Really easy to make and came out awesome. It is super, super chocolatey. I frosted with Satiny Chocolate Glaze made with 1/4 tsp. orange extract instead of vanilla and it was a huge hit. This cake hypnotized people at a dinner party.

EXCELLENT is all I can say!  This cake was SUPER moist, very chocolatey, soft on the inside and a little crispy on the outside.  I used the regular chocolate chips and I thought it came out great (they pretty much melted, didnt come chunky at all).  I topped mine with a little powdered sugar, my husband put on a dab of whipped cream. Thank you so much for the recipe... I will me making this again and again!  (Beware... you will need a big glass of milk after eating this, as one other reviewer said :)

This recipe was delicious! I was looking for a cake to make for Easter and came across this.  It was a big hit and my family already mentioned wanting me to make it for the next holiday.  It turned out very moist.  I used mini chocolate chips like another reviewer mentioned.  Also I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze per others advice.  So good!  Highly recommend if you love chocolate!

This cake was so moist,flavorful,thick and rich. I did use cooled coffee instead of water. I had to go to the fridge a second time for more milk because it was that rich especially with the satiny glaze some of the other reviews recommended

DELICIOUS!!!!  I loved this cake and made minor changes:  1)had german choc cake mix so used that 2) used tiny choc chips and another review was right--tiny melted bites of chocolate in every bite!!  Also, I haven't had much luck in the past w/bundt pans so I divided mine into a pyrex dish and a pampered chef clay round dish.  Clay dish finished in 40 minutes, pyrex 47 minutes.

Honestly, the whole adding of chocolate chips to a cake batter baffles me. The texture is terrible. I didn't care for this recipe and think the cake was ruined by using a cake mix, chocolate chips and walnuts. I'm going to rely more on the homemade versions and skip all the chunky stuff next time.

This is truly a delicious cake. Made it several times within the last few weeks and got rave reviews.  Very easy to make.  As others suggested, I reduced oil to ½ cup and added ½ of milk.  In my oven it baked for approximately 65 minutes.  It’s a keeper.

this was a great and really simple cake to make.  one question was how to make the cake less eggy-smelling?  that was the only criticism that anybody had. i'd recommend icing the cake as the final touch. my favorite icing is just mixing  sour cream with some melted chocolate chips. its great.

Fantastic. Very easy.  This was my first bunt cake.  I baked it a little longer because the middle looked runny, but turns out it was the gooey chocolate chips.  I dusted it with powdered sugar.  Very tasty.

Made this cake with 1/2 c. oil & 1/2 c. of milk. Very dense! I think I would have prefered a lighter cake. Served with freshly whipped cream (not too sweet) and it was a good combination.

Love this recipe!  I had to "cheat" and make a box cake for husband's birthday but didn't want it to taste like a box cake.  This is an easy recipe and really good.  I made it with 2-9 in rounds and the batter was exactly right.  I used mini choc chips, maybe that's the key?  They added to the texture without being a weird addition like I was afraid they might.  I also frosted using the chocolate buttercream on this site and it was over the top chocolaty!  I'm saving this recipe for a girls-get-together.

Oh my goodness....this cake is PERFECTION!!  It was the easiest and most yummiest chocolate cake ever.  I made it as part of my family Christmas get-together dinner and everyone LOVED it.  They each came back for seconds and then all asked for some to take home with them.  I should have made TWO cakes because there wasn't enough for everyone to have two helpings PLUS take some home (plus have leftovers for me!)  Everyone asked for this recipe.  I'm making it again for Christmas day dinner with friends.  THANKS DENISE!!!     ~Tonya

This was one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever tried. It was incredibly moist and chocolatey. Even my mom, who rarely eats sweets, ate two pieces of it in one sitting! I would also recommend freezing it and eating it frozen later-its kind of like ice cream cake.

Thank you for submitting this recipe!  I have been looking for a chocolate cake that wasn't too rich and I have finally found one.  Everyone raved about it and several asked for the recipe.  I should have made two!

Outstanding Taste, Texture and Presentation! I only had the small box of pudding and used 3/4 cup of oil, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 cup of coffee, eliminated the chocolate chips. Baked for 56 minutes. Perfection! Topped it off with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site. Thank you, will make again and again!

made this for my son's birthday - everyone wanted the recipe.  Made it in a 9x13 pan and frosted with Creamy Cream Cheese Frosting (on this site - using a suggestion for crushed hershey bars with almonds in frosting!)  both recipes were the best!!!

Very good chocolate taste.  I cut back on the oil, only used a little less than 3/4C, cake was still dense and moist.  It's not too sweet which is nice when putting an icing on it.  I would make it again.

I made this cake for Valentine's Day. I prepared it in two heart-shaped cake pans. Although the edges were a little crusty by the time the center became done, it was fine after I frosted it with a chocolate buttercream frosting. (I will try it next time with less oil) Very moist on the inside with a very rich chocolate taste. I used mini-chocolate chips, and thought the texture was great. My husband and another couple loved it. Served it with a few raspberries on the side. Denise, thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday, and he absolutely loves it.  I agree with some of the earlier reviewers that it is sweet and chocolatey enough without glaze or frosting.  This was a simple recipe to make, and I know that I will make it again!

I'm not a huge chocolate fan so I wouldn't make this very often.  It is very rich.  If you are a huge chocolate fan then I would think you'd be in chocolate heaven with this cake.  I would have liked for it to be just a tad sweeter though.

MMMMM, Chocolate!  My entire family loved this one.  I loved how moist it was and also the chocolate chips give it a nice texture.  I did drizzle some chocolate sauce on top then dusted with powdered sugar.  It looks pretty and tastes great.  WONDERFUL with homemade ice cream.  :)

This is a REALLY good cake, it was a hit with the critics at my office, they seemed to think it would be even better with nuts. I think I'm trying that next time. I accidently used a small 3.9 oz.box of pudding mix instead of 5.9 oz., and I used a chocolate mocha cake mix and it was still really good, although I will use straight chocolate cake mix next time.

What a great recipe. I made this for my in-laws 
Thanksgiving dinner and they loved it.  I'm not much of a chocolate person so I took they opinion of it.  This will stay a family favorite.  I followed the recipe except lengthened the baking time by 10-15 minutes.

Made this for company and it disappeared quickly! My husband is a chocoholic, so he was disappointed that there was not much left. Definitely a first prize winner in our book!

I love bundt cake.  This one is one of the better ones.  I had to increase baking time by 10 minutes but it could just be my out of date oven.

Instead of warm water I mix in a cup of coffee for extra richness. Grapeseed oil works great too instead of vegetable oil and the cake always retains it's moistness. I get the most compliments from this cake!

CanNOT stress how AWESOME this cake recipe is! The first time I made it for my wife, all three of my daughters asked for it to be their next birthday cake. Aside from how deliciously moist this cake is, it’s equally versatile. We’ve have tried nearly a dozen cake and jello combinations, and all produce with excellence!

One of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had!! So tasty with homemade whipped cream on Thanksgiving. Please make this — you won’t be disappointed! Also, we cut the amount of chocolate chips in half and it was plenty.

doubtful anyone will see this. there's a reason it has so many reviews!
Such an excellent cake. 
I added a Mousse de doce de leite as a frosting with blueberries, raspberries and strawberries to decorate and was perfect with the cake.

My wife if is from Brazil and says American cakes suck. They are too dry. 
She was more than pleased with this as her birthday cake.

This is my “go to chocolate cake” recipe.  I needed cupcakes and this recipe made 12 cupcakes and 6 mini bundt cakes.  I baked them at 350 for 17 minutes for the cupcakes and 18 minutes for the mini bundt cakes. I frost with the chocolate ganache recipe also from this site and garnish with red raspberries.

I was a little apprehensive about this recipe because cake mixes have reduced in size by 3 - 4 oz.  Therefore I used a little less sour cream, oil, and water.  Nevertheless, the cake is perfect! It’s still moist and the chocolate chips give a little burst of chocolate with each bite.  I’m claiming this as my go-to chocolate cake recipe.

LynneinVA was spot on!!!  Her review said "Fabulous, rich cake! BUT cake mixes are no longer 18+ ounces. In order to keep the correct consistency, I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup, reduced the water to 1/3 cup and took away one egg. Turned out perfect!" Her review made sense so I followed it, along with adding only 1 cup of mini chips.  Topped it with Easy Chocolate Bundt  Cake Glaze and it was fabulously moist and chocolately.

What an awesome easy recipe. So moist and chocolatey.  I made my homemade chunky  peanut butter frosting  for an extra special break from adding more chocolate to this cake. I also sliced individual pieces to put in the freezer for later.  Will definitely make this again.

Maybe not quite as much oil as noted in recipe, but all else by the book. Super SUPER moist and didn't even need frosting or glaze as far as I was concerned. Used mini morsel chips. Might like trying with white cake, and vanilla pudding and white chocolate morsels, just to see if that would work!

Don't change a thing! I made this recipe many times it's perfect and my go to for most birthday cakes at my house. For frosting we have used: butter cream, cream cheese ,chocolate and powered sugar. all homemade and amazing (easy, try it!) you will never go back to canned. Today I will try German chocolate frosting a birthday request.  TIP: don't make it a day ahead because  someone will eat it and you will have to make another for the event... OR you could go ahead and make two someone will eat it! Thank you so much for sharing!! Update!! German Chocolate was awesome!!

So easy and very very delicious. I did not make the ganache. It would have been to sweet for us. I sprinkled powered sugar  on top. Everyone loved it.

Delicious!!!  Moist, rich, and easy to make.  This recipe is a little much for the bundt pan, so I like to use a little tiny cake pan to make a little bakers treat, extra just for me.

I've made this several times. Just follow the directions! It's bizarre to me that people feel the need to give a recipe 3 stars and then talk about all the changes they made to it. This is a fantastic cake as is!!

I made a simple chocolate ganache icing for this cake.  Just bring 1 cup of heavy cream to a boil (don't let it boil too much or it will spill over) and pour over 1 package of semi-sweet dark chocolate chips, whisk (or use stand mixer) until creamy and pour over cooled cake.  Delicious!!!

I would not change anything about the cake recipe.  It was awesome!   I did top it with the Chocolate Ganache recipe from  INGRIDEVOGEL  as suggested after watching the cake video.  I made a half batch of the ganache & it went  with the cake well.  My friends at work loved it.  The cake baked for 55 minutes and it was perfect.  I let it cool one and a half hours in the pan, as directed.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.
8-2-2018 Follow Up:  
By now,  I  have also made this recipe as standard aka regular-sized cupcakes.  I used the paper liners that come with the outer foil liner (both layers attached (JoAnn)  and both layers loose (Walmart or Meijer).  Both kinds of liners worked great in cupcake pans.  I used my Pampered Chef scoops.  It took 1 scoop of small plus  1 scoop of medium for each cupcake with 17 minutes baking time at 350 degrees.  The toothpick testing does not really work because of the chocolate chips.   The result was 34 cupcakes.  

 I also made trays of mini cupcakes (1.25 inches diameter on bottom) using paper liners in cupcake pans.  I put the 1 scoop of batter in each liner using the small Pampered Chef scoop.  This was at   350 degrees with 9 minutes baking time.  It all went well.  I put chocolate ganache on the cupcakes.

I may never make another chocolate cake again. So easy, so delicious. This is my new favorite "go to" dessert recipe. A little powdered sugar over the top and it's perfect.

I have made this cake countless times and it is ALWAYS a crowd pleaser! I beat my eggs/sour cream/oil at high speed which adds volume to what is a pretty dense cake. I followed the recommendation and used mini chips. Do yourself a favor and make it so that there are few leftovers; it will save you from the temptation of eating it all!

This recipe is definitely chocolaty!!  I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday. He and the family loved it, and went back for seconds.

I followed the recipe as written. Although they don't make 18.25 oz cake mix anymore. So I added 3 oz of cake mix from another box.  I also used 1.5 cups of mini-chips (so they would melt completely)  instead of 2 cups of regular chips.  I topped the cake with a chocolate ganache garnished with fresh raspberries.   Note: Cook time for my oven was 60 - 70 mins.

I will definitely use this recipe again but in this chocolate lover's opinion you only really need to add 1 cup of mini chocolate chips. 

Variations to try: 
Make it with reduced fat ingredients and substitute apple sauce for the oil. 

Top with a raspberry glaze garnished with fresh raspberries

Bon Appétit!!

I was very nervous about this cake when I was shopping for ingredients. Simply put, I couldn't find any boxes the size this recipe says. All cake boxes were 15.75 oz instead of 18.75 and as for puddings, none would add up to 5.9. I ended up getting 3x 2.1oz boxes which made me think this recipe would be doomed... too much pudding powder and not enough cake. Even when mixing it all up, my batter didn't "pour" into my pan, it was more a dough and flopped. I had to break it up into chunks and press into my bundt pan. Baked as it says and let it cool for nearly two hours. I was surprised how much it has risen and although having a little trouble getting it out the pan, it held its shape. In fact, it was looking like a normal cake. I drizzled some hot chocolate syrup on the top figuring it had enough chocolate as it was. What I cut into was a very dense, moist chocolate cake. The chocolate chips were spread evenly throughout much to my delight. Flavorwise, its as the name says. I only give four stars because although good, I would have prefered a lighter version rather than so dense, probably a result of the sizing issues. Not sure where people are shopping that Jell-O and Duncan Hines makes their stuff in these sizes but it isn't around me.

I made this based on the ratings and IT WAS AWESOME! I didnt change a thing from the original recipe and it turned out GREAT! One thing I learned from another reviewer was to not mistake the chocolate chips in the batter for uncooked batter when you are testing it for doneness. I overcooked mine a bit due to thinking that the chocolate chips were uncooked batter. It was an amazing cake and I can't wait to make it again!

I only topped the cake with a bit of powdered sugar, and it was AMAZING! (The best chocolate cake I've had in my life) I used a 3.9 ounce package of pudding instead of 5.9, and my cake mix was 15.25 ounces instead of 18.25, but the cake turned out perfect. I cooked it for about 10 minutes more than the recipe said to, because at 50 minutes, the cake wasn't done in the center.

This is the BEST, EASIEST, chocolate cake ever.  My boys beg me to make this all the time.  The only problem is it only lasts about two days.  I found this recipe when I started doing all the cooking when my wife left us.

This cake will not disappoint.  I have made it at least 10 times.  For more of good thing, add 1/4 cup dark chocolate  unsweetened cocoa and 1/2 cup sugar.  No more liquid is required.  Now this is Too Much Chocolate! Not...

Super easy recipe. This is truly an incedibly delicious cake full of deep full chocolate flavor. In order to make it perfect be sure to use top quality semi-sweet chocolate chips (ex: Ghirardelli or equivalent), use good quality Italian extra virgin olive oil, and mix the cake mix and pudding mix together with hot (not warm) tap water before adding the rest of the ingredients. This helps the chocolate bloom and deepen in flavor. When completely cooled I make a Chocolate ganache with heavy whipping cream and semi-sweet chocolate chips and pour it on top of the cake. It is amazing!!

I LOVE this cake! I consider myself a cake connoisseur and this cake is outstanding. The first time I made it I added the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site as recommended by another user, but I actually found that with the frosting it was too much chocolate, which I've never said in my life. The cake by itself is rich and does not need any frosting. It is also excellent served with some vanilla ice cream!!

I am in the process of making this, after I added everything, the batter was super  thick.  I looked at the ingredients and it calls for a cake mix 18.25 ounces.  A standard cake mix box is 15.25 ounces. Because I wasn't sure exactly what to do, I added more sour cream and water.  It's rising very nicely but taking long to bake.  I am worried its going to be too  dense.  I'll keep you posted......The cake came out very moist and light but was a little oily.

Moist and delicious. In my oven, it took 58 minutes at 350 °. I cooled it for 1-1/2 hours and it slid right out of the bundt pan which I thoroughly greased with Crisco.  Allowed the cake to cool and then topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe - also on this site.  It was a big hit!

Chocolate heaven!!! Everyone who has tasted this cake loves it. My only substitutions are 1cup applesauce for the oil (keeps it moister), and I like the mini chocolate chips as they "float" throughout the cake.  I have experimented with this recipe and you can use different flavors of cake mix and coincide flavors of pudding, using white chips as a sub (i.e.:butter pecan/butterscotch pudding & chips). It has turned out great each time.

I've been making this recipe for years (got it from a friend long ago) so was thrilled to see it here. It's so simple but an absolute winner.  My recipe also calls  for icing sugar to be dusted on top when cool, which is a terrific (and light) finish, but lately I've been doing something different to great acclaim. I add peppermint to the cake batter and then frost with a green mint butter cream icing. As an added bonus, I crush up chocolate mint cookies (or mint chocolate bar) and sprinkle on the icing. My friends go nuts!!! If you like chocolate and mint, I highly recommend that option.

Very chocolaty but super good. I made a chocolate butter cream frosting and cooked my cake in two 9" round pans. I cooked them for 45 minutes at 350'. I put strawberry jam between the layers. Turned out perfectly. Next time I may try milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweets because I prefer a sweeter cake. Very rich, moist, and dense with a nice texture (chips).

I love this cake--it is so moist and full of flavor.  I chopped my chocolate chips into smaller pieces as I was worried they might sink to the bottom of the batter.  This will be my go to chocolate cake in the future.

Made this for a Birthday.  Easy and very moist and delicious. 
Hesitated using the full cup of oil but decided to use it after reading review from the pastry chef.  Glad for the advice because like she said use all the oil, "because its cake".

I made this with a gluten free cake mix and it was amazing. My mom never likes when I make things gluten free and she could not stop raving over how good it was. I? can not wait to make it again!

This cake is delicious.  We will be making it again for our New Year's celebration dinner.  A container of frosting heated in the microwave until it is thick yet pourable works as the finishing touch.

I only changed up one small thing, but beyond that, it was AMAZING!! Definitely will be making again and again! My guests raved about it! I only changed the chocolate chips for Andes Mints baking pieces. I wanted a little more of a minty taste since it was for Christmas. I topped it with the Chocolate Ganach from AR and it was to die for!! YUMMMMMMM

This is a FANTASTIC I made this yesterday to bring to a friend house for Christmas gathering everyone love it, after I finish eating one slice I felt I was in chocolate heaven.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe, the only thing I did differently was only added 3 eggs and I mix semisweet chocolate with milk chocolate I felt that gave it a great flavor.  Then I did a chocolate ganache to drizzle on to, the chocolate ganache recipe can be found right on Allrecipes.  I am looking forward to making this again.

Great cake for the chocolate lover which I am. I Set aside a little of the instant pudding powder in a zip lock bag & add the chocolate chips to it & shake up. After cake ingredients are mixed I add and stir in. This keeps the chips from all sinking to the bottom. A delicious & easy cake to make.

If you like chocolate, you will love this cake! I've made this cake for years and every year I get requests  for it! It's a very dense cake ,  I don't use frosting just a little powdered sugar sprinkled over the top is all it really needs.

This chocolate cake was phenomenal, I would go as far to say, the best I have had. Super easy to make and for me, not the slightest but sickly. Which I thought may be the case with the amount of chocolate added. Amazingly moist. Even after fully cooled, middle  of cake still felt like a warm melted cake would. I poured melted milk chocolate on top. Amazing.

I followed the recipe as is. Instead of powdered sugar, I drizzled raspberry purée. A huge hit and it will be my go-to dessert when time is limited.

Update/additional info.  I made the chocolate ganache and used that recipe as written too.  I did use good quality Belgian chocolate in both cake and ganache.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The only differences I make is add one tablespoon of instant espresso coffee to the half cup of warm water and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Great with cream cheese frosting or chocolate buttercream . Wonderful for cupcakes. Made cupcakes for work once and everyone loved them.  Some people referred to my cupcakes as the best they had ever had. These are adults!!! Boy was I happy.... Delicious!!!!

Just follow the recipe and you'll do great!! I just melt Betty Crocker frosting on the stove and drizzle it over the cake. Sprinkle a few more chocolate chips and you're done!!

Cut Vegetable oil to 3/4 cup.  Our grocery store didn't  have the 18.25 oz. cake mix  so used the regular size and didn't seem to matter. Also used the small chocolate chips which were perfect.

I gave 4 stars because it needs a bit of modification to be perfect but if you follow chef joy's suggestions of only 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup of chocolate chips this cake comes out perfect. I always bake mine in two  9 inch rounds put caramel and  pecans on it for a turtle cake. Super yummy. I wanted to add that boxed cake mixes have less in them they are only 16.25 ounces now I think.  I still use the same amounts,  and it comes out great.  You can also use vanilla cake mix, and vanilla pudding for a great vanilla cake. I have left out the chocolate chips completely and prefer this without them less sweet. I make cakes from scratch all the time this one is comparable. It is a great time saver and tastes much better then just using the directions on the box.

This is as good as it gets for super-chocolate cake!  Made recipe exactly as written, with one exception.  Only found a 15.6 oz box of cake mix.  No other changes.  Used the Chocolate Ganache recipe on allrecipes.com (by INGREDEVOGEL).  My recommendation:  stick with a small piece and have cold milk handy.  This is VERY rich, but VERY good!

I was really nervous about this cake because of the cake mix amounts. My stores only carry 15.25 oz. cake  mixes. I bought the Betty Crocker Devil's Chocolate Cake mix. I added 3 oz. Of cake flour and about a half teaspoon of cocoa powder to compensate for the difference. Also, my pudding was only 3.9 oz. I didn't add anything to compensate for that. I followed the recipe exactly after that and it turned out great for me. It appears that everyone has really good results with this recipe, I'm curious if anyone else noticed these changes in cake mix amounts. It seems to be all cake mixes. And now I'm curious about the pudding too. I'll have to look when I go back to the store. Anyway, it turned out great and I'd make it again. I'm going to frost it with chocolate frosting and decorate it with chocolate curls!

When made as directed by the recipe, it's hard to fail with this cake. It's a rich, dark, moist cake that is super easy to make. Messing around with the ingredients is one's choice, but it's a bad choice. There is a reason that this cake is so popular: the submitter knows how to bring out the best in the ingredients.

Followed the recipe exactly. Everyone said this was the best chocolate cake they've ever had!! A winner!  Thank you to the reviewer who said toss the chocolate chips in flour so that they won't sink to the bottom. It worked perfectly! I ever so slightly sprayed the chips with Pam to get the flour to stick and tossed them in.

This is a GREAT recipe. I did make the following changes...instead of chocolate cake mix I used rotini noodles - about two cups - instead of pudding I brown a half pound of hamburger (seasoned with cajun seasoning, onions, garlic, and pepper). I boiled/drained the noodles and mixed with the beef. In place of sour cream and vegetable oil I used a jar of pizza sauce and instead of a cup of water I used a cup of milk (though water would have probably been fine). And instead of chocolate chips I used sliced pepperoni. And finally instead of eggs I topped with cheese. Baked 350 until the cheese was bubbly. Delish!! Thanks for the great recipe!!! Happy kids at my place!! They ask me to make this again and again!!

I have made this cake over twenty times in the last couple years. I only do it on holidays and birthdays. I usually make the cake and we have a few pieces. I send it off with my husband to work to save me the calories.  Everyone at my husbands work asks when the next cake will arrive. The only thing I do different is leave the chocolate chips out and follow the recipe to a tee. I find the chips burned at the bottom of the pan the first time I did it and it was (just like the title) too much chocolate. But leaving the chips out made it just right. I also use the cream cheese frosting from allrecipes and its the perfect match. Over the years I have done different flavors. For yellow, white, and multi color cakes I use vanilla pudding instead of the chocolate pudding.  It comes out perfect every time. I am not an expert baker but everybody at my husbands work thinks I am. lol Thank you to whoever submitted this recipe.  It will be a family recipe for years to come. I found this recipe amazing and easy to follow.

I have made this twice now and it has come out perfect both times. I substituted 1/2 cup of canola oil and 1/3 cup of milk as others had suggested. Other than that I followed the recipe but needed it to bake for 60 minutes. Will definitely be making this many more times.

I've made this as chocolate and reversed it using a white cake mix and vanilla pudding with white chocolate. Amazing with a great icing drizzle. 
**Remember that sour cream can be replaced with plain yogurt **
Aboslutely loved by all !

I've been making this cake since the 1970's.  Lost the recipe over the last decade or so, so it's nice to see it again.  This cake is a real winner - and it's easy to put together.  Thanks for sharing!

First time I made it, I did not make any changes and it was GREAT.  I have made it every year for my step son's birthday.  This year I forgot to buy sour cream so I added mayo and it is just as good.

Great recipe, I have made it a half dozen times.  I have added different things and made variations.  It is bullet proof.  I don't see how it could go wrong.  I use very well greased silicone bundt pans with intricate designs, and I can usually pop these out without too much trouble.

This was excellent - so easy to make and very moist.  I also topped it with the Satiny chocolate glaze which was perfect.  I could not find an 18.25 ounce cake mix but I used the current size of 15.25 and kept the rest of the recipe the same and it turned out great.

It is an awesome recipe. I made it the first time following the recipe exactly but in my case it had way too much chocolate so for the next time I made little changes that I wanna share. First of all, instead of chocolate pudding mix I used butterscotch pudding mix and it really help with all the chocolate. Other thing is that i also eliminated the chocolate chips, and this time when my family tasted it they thought it was great because it didn't have all of that chocolate but it still remained a chocolate cake. But the original recipe is still amazing and it deserves 5 stars.

Made it just as described for my wife's birthday, and my family (especially my wife) LOVED it!!! She says my tights and cape are on order, because I am definitely her favorite superhero!

I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from allrecipes.com to top off this gastronomical masterpiece.

This cake is absolutely delicious. My family can't get enough...I made a few variations:
I used 15.25 ounces of triple fudge cake mix and 3 ounces of fudge cake, I've also made it with 15.25 ounces fudge and 3 ounces dark chocolate. I substituted the oil with unsweetened applesauce, and to smooth out the batter I added about 2 TBS of milk and about 1 TB of coconut oil. I like to use the Satiny Glaze over it and I finally garnish with some fresh strawberries.

This cake was moist and tasty.  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips and that was enough.  I used half a cup of sour cream and half a cup of vanilla yogurt.  I frosted the cake with creamy chocolate frosting from this website.  Then I sliced some strawberries to decorate the cake.  It was delicious and looked really nice too.

This is a very easy cake to make and it has been a huge hit. I  have made 4 of these in 5 days if that tells you anything. The recipe can be altered to make it a little healthier, which I did on 2 of the cakes I made. I have even had a co worker tell me she would be happy to pay me to make her one. True to the name, it is very chocolatey. A cold glass of milk is all you need  for this wonderful cake. It is definitely my favorite new recipe.

Loved it! But made the adjustment of using only 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c water. Don't worry it is plenty moist!! I also use Betty Crocker Chocolate Fudge cake mix instead of Devils food. DIVINE!!!

This is my go to recipe for decorated cakes. I do reduce the oil to about 3/4 cup. Also makes great cupcakes but because of the high amount of oil it soaks through the papers. For cupcakes I use 1/2 cup oil, though one of these days I'm going to substitute it with applesauce and see what happens. I love to pair this with Georgetown Cupcakes buttercream recipe and add a bit of flavored creamer (Samoa GS Cookie is the best) for an amazing flavor.

I've made this a few times now. The first time with the original recipe. It is terrific. Then I made some changes like cutting the oil in half and replacing with applesauce instead, and I use light sour cream. It has tasted great both ways. I also add frosting or ganache. Yummy!

My sister made this for her daughter's birthday as cupcakes. Some with/some without frosting from another recipe on this site. With the frosting it was great, but too much chocolate; however, without the frosting, it's absolutely perfect. The chocolate. The texture. The overall satisfaction. It is to die for... and I rarely say that about anything.

Is wonderful and moist on it's own, but it would be good paired with a raspberry topping or a homemade fudge frosting.

This recipe is great, but I cannot seem to get it to bake as well in a bundt pan. I think the results are better with two 9 inch rounds. It is very rich, so I usually make a light glaze with it.

Pretty delicious - a little oily though. I think next time I'll use some butter instead and see how it turns out. I left out the chocolate chips and that was a mistake - this recipe needs them :)

This cake turned out to be not as moist as I was hoping.  By the second day it had lost all it's appeal and was just a mound of chocolate crumbs waiting to happen.

In the picture it has icing, but reading the recipe I did not think I would need any icing for it.  I thought it was just ok, kind of similar to the taste of a brownie.  If I made it again I would ice it.

Made this for my boyfriend's birthday. I thought it would be too sweet but it turned out perfect, just right and thick and extremely moist. I made a 6 inch cake out of half the batter (took about 40 minutes) and then used the rest for cupcakes (13 minutes).  Then, layered it with nutella buttercream frosting, crushed walnuts and almonds, and strawberry roses. It was wonderful! I'll keep this recipe for sure.

Love this!! I've made it twice.  1st exactly how the recipe calls.  I didn't find it super chocolatey (but I'm not personally a fan of devils food cake flavor) .  The 2nd time I used dark choc fudge cake mix instead.  It. Was. awesome.  Probably could go about 47-48 mins instead of 50.  But I always under cook my cakes for moistness.

Absolutely fabulous cake! I have made it several times and every single time any and  everyone that takes a bite rants and raves and asks for more. I make it exactly as the recipe states and I top it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze and chocolate chips. I would give this cake 100 stars if I could. Try it I promise you will not be disappointed. 
Fan-tab-ulous!!!

I made this cake for a work food day.  It was a fantastic hit.  Will surely give it a couple months and then run it again!

This is a winner!  I make most things from scratch, and take pride in that, but this beats any other chocolate cake that I know!  Moist and delicious every single time.  It has become a go-to recipe.  I add a couple of teaspoons of instant coffee crystals (I am not sure they are needed), and always cover the cake with Satiny Chocolate Glaze by: Ginger found on this site.  This recipe can't miss.

This is my staple chocolate cake recipe that I always have to make! It is the best warmed up or fresh out of the oven with some vanilla bean ice cream. I have passed this recipe onto a lot of people who rave about it. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made the cake into layers. I made the cake for my BFFs 68th birthday. She would not share the cake with anyone but I made two small cupcakes for myself so I could taste it. It was very very good.....straight out of the oven.

This cake is AMAZING. I made it the night before work and took it with me, everyone was both impressed, delighted, and savoring over this recipe. I added a bit of Nutella and i loved it. This cake is so creamy, chocolatey, and just perfect. It's so simple and easy to make. You don't require a lot of ingredients and can make it whenever you want. Permanent addition to my house for sure.

Made this for my birthday, first bundt cake ever!  It was excellent, and i followed the recipe with the exception of using olive oil (all i had on hand). Could not taste it.I also replaced the water with coffee as another reviewer suggested.
Iced it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze and followed another reviewers suggestion to heat the butter and corn syrup first then add the chocolate chips, works fantastic, no microwaving needed. Garnished with local strawberries, now in season, which adds a fresh burst of flavour with such a rich cake. Love it!

I've made this cake several times now and have loved it every time.  The first go-around was for my Dad who is a chocolate lover.  He thought it was amazing and I agree.  Moist, delicious, very chocolatey.  I topped it with Chocolate Ganache (from this site as well).  Excellent and easy!

I made this last night.  I didn't have chocolate pudding, so I used what I had on hand... Sugar free white chocolate pudding.  I used Betty Crocker Super Moist Triple Chocolate Fudge with lowest sour cream.  I don't have any chocolate chips, but there are some little ones in the batter.  It was decadent.  No frosting needed. Just powdered sugar for decor. Yummy.

Not to bad.  Tastes like a box cake, but the glaze does help to round out the flavor and make it a little better.

This recipe is not that sweet and I could not find any local grocery store that carried an 18.25 ounce cake mix, most only had 16.25!  Ive had better tasting chocolate bundt cake.  Yes it was moist, but lacked in that rich chocolate sweetness I enjoy in bundt cakes!

My husband does NOT like chocolate BUT this cake was so unbelievable that he ate it to the very end with some vanilla ice cream! 

I made this with NO CHANGES and it was amazing! My daughter did request vanilla icing which I did sprinkle with chocolate chips. 

Even better the second and third days. Sorry I couldn't tell you about the fourth because it was gone!

I made this cake for my beloved boyfriend who came home from a school trip no longer than an hour ago, and for my dad (who has a sweet tooth). I followed the cake recipe exactly... except for greasing the pan... I forgot to do that. But in the end, the boys loved it and the cake itself turned out perfect (the excess oil other reviewers mentioned was actually what saved the cake). So now I know that I don't need to grease the bundt pan if I use the amount of oil the recipe calls for. Now I have to pawn the rest of it off at school tomorrow because of the celiac in my family, and I'm sure the cake will be a huge hit.

I never take the time to write any reviews, but this one is definitely work a review! This cake is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! My husband isn't a chocolate fan and he has already ate half the pan. I didn't make any changes to the recipe aside from the fact that I used a regular glass cake pan because I didn't have a bundt pan. It took exactly 55 minutes to bake in a regular glass pan, but of course I checked it throughout just to make sure I wouldn't burn it. I topped it with the satin glaze also on this website and spread a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips on top. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and by far the best chocolate cake I've ever had; especially with some vanilla ice cream.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and it was a hit every time! No need to alter the recipe. It is moist and delicious. The last time I made it, I added peanut butter chocolate chips and used peanut butter icing. It also goes really well with President's Choice cookies and cream ice cream.

I really enjoy this cake. I follow the directions. However, that being said, it tastes better if you use a different chocolate cake mix than a devil's food mix. Devil's food is rich in color, but not chocolate taste. The cake tastes better if you use a chocolate fudge mix or some other chocolate mix.

I've made this cake many times now and it always comes out really well. This time I used yellow cake mix, coconut cream pudding mix, sweetened, flaked coconut, semi-sweet chocolate chips and a 1/4t. rum flavor. I made a boo-boo and forgot the sour cream... we took the cake back out of the oven, mixed in the sour cream and voila! It was now chocolate coconut cream cake. The semi-sweet pieces had just been in there long enough to melt. Once it was cooled completely I drizzled bottled warmed up caramel ice cream topping and then sprinked the whole thing with toasted coconut and almonds. Even the big BOO-BOO didn't factor in to it's deliciousness!!! Really Decadent to the MAX!

This Chocolate Cake is rich, moist and chocolaty heaven. I have made it 3 times and my family now simply refers to it as "THE" Cake.  I made per recipe except I reduced oil to 3/4 cup as suggested.  Came out perfectly.  I  use the One minute Chocolate icing also from this site for a lovely glaze on top.  Serve alone or with vanilla ice cream. Yum!!

I have to admit, I wondered if this recipe would work and not only did it work, it was a smashing success at a luncheon at work.  I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe for the topping.  I also chose to process some White Chocolate Chips as the "Sprinkle" on top of the cake.  It was perfect!  The white of the White Chocolate Chips contrasted perfectly with the dark cake.  The cake was very moist, not dry at all.  I wound up cooking it for 55 minutes in my oven.  I will definitely make again as I am a chocolate lover and look for delicious recipes to make.  
The video showed the user making it with a wire whisk on the mixer.  But I used the flat blade and it worked just fine.  Next time I make it, I will try using the White Chocolate Chips as the base in the Satiny Glaze.

I made this for my son's birthday and everybody loved it! I also made a Gluten Free version by using a GF Devils Food Cake mix and it was just as wonderful! The only thing I changed for both was I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I sprinkled powdered suger on top and topped them with orange slices, grapes and kiwi slices. So good!

I loved this recipe, as did my bf, my parents, and my co-workers.  I made my in a 8 loaf mini-loaf pan: it makes about 20 loafs and takes about 22 min to bake them.  Fill each mini loaf spot a little more than half way with batter and just put the extra batter in the fridge while baking.  Then on each loaf I put about 4 chocolate chips which then melted and made a nice smooth chocolate center.  The regular size chips worked great, esp when reheated in the microwave.  Stayed moist for days, if they last that long!

Wonderful! Made it just like the recipe, only thing different was I used a chocolate cake mix instead of devil's food. It was wonderful! Very moist, but just a little crispy on edges, which was really good! I made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze, and it works very well! Great job!

WOW! I followed recipe exactly the first time. It must have been good because by the time I cleaned the kitchen, all the muffins were gone. Second time I used coffee instead of water and peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. Topped it with peanut butter icing ( 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup brown sugar with 1tb.milk,bring to boil stirring constantly for 2min then add 2/3 cup peanut butter and let cool until it thickens)...they were soooo good. Next time I might try a healthy version but how can you improve perfection. I made giant muffins instead of bundt cake and cooked them at 350 for 35 min.

This is my first review - this cake is so good I had to write!!  I made it for our Christmas dinner dessert.  What a hit!!  My 15 year old grandson had a large piece and then asked if he could take a piece home for later. I made some changes after reading other reviews.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup cream/milk.  I had the cream so I used it.  I also used the mini chocolate chips which I very lightly dusted with flour (2 tsp).  I used 2 small boxes of sugar free instant chocolate pudding.  I was worried it would be just too too sweet, but it wasn't.  It was heavy, moist and delicious. For the frosting, I slightly warmed a can of chocolate fudge frosting and "poured" it over the top to drip down the sides.  Then I drizzled butterscotch and white fudge over that.  Heavenly!!

Can this recipe stand another 5 star rating?!  I have to say this was one of the best chocolate cakes I have EVER tasted!  I never thought a cake would be ok without frosting/icing but this one is perfect without it. It is so moist and chocolate-y. Make this cake as directed, you won't be sorry!

I made this yesterday, I normally don't use packaged products and this recipe is why. It was just OK. I followed the recipe exactly. I did not like the texture of this cake. I watched the time very carefully because over baking a cake will always result in dryness, and I thought this cake was dry, strange color too. Not a rich, dark chocolate like I was expecting. Will not make it again.

This was a quick and easy cake to make and came out very moist.  It definitely doesn't need and frosting or glaze maybe just a light dusting of powdered sugar as it is quite sweet on it's own.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was posted.  I will for sure make this again.

I only had boxed red velvet cake so I followed the recipe with red velvet cake instead of chocolate cake mix.  For frosting I used the cream cheese frosting II.  This was wonderful.

This is a fool proof recipe, and always a winner.  I substitute egg whites for the eggs, apple sauce for the oil and 0 fat yogurt instead of sour cream.  Delicious.

It's too much chocolate for my taste but it's very moist!  What gives it's moisture is definetely the sour cream and pudding mixture.  I tried a recipe from this idea as suggested one reviewer. I made cupcakes out of it.  The cupcakes were absolutely incredible, family is pleased with this recipe! Recipe  goes like this 
-box of white cake
- vanilla pudding mixture (jello trade) 110 g (bigger isnt found no where) 
- 1 cup of fat free sour cream
- half cup oil 
- half cupmilk 
- 4 eggs
and most important a box of fresh rasberry! (add them after mixing the whole mixture up so they don't get broken , better taste)
 TRUST ME it's delicious :)

I've made this twice already, once for a friend and once for a church bake sale. My friend is a chocolate lover and she absolutely LOVED this cake! In order for me to try it, I took a little batter out and made cupcake from it and it was sooo good! I will be making this again for a church dinner. This recipe is a keeper!

Since a few other reviewers said that the choc. chips sank to the bottom, I put 1.5 cups choc. chips in the batter and baked for 20 min. Then I sprinkled the rest of the choc. chips on top, and baked for the duration. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. I took it to work to celebrate our associate pastor's 1 year ordination anniversary, and he and all of my coworkers loved it! Thanks for a great, quick recipe!

This cake is super easy to make, and it proved to be a real crowd-pleaser at my party. The only thing I changed was that I used mini-chocolate chips, based on suggestions by other reviewers.

I've made this cake for years and dubbed it "Easy Chocolate Cake".  For variety, I substitute the water with milk, orange, raspberry or mint liqueurs.  Delish!!

I LOVED this cake.  My husband and stepson, thought it was good, but not fabulous.  I did modify the recipe a little bit.  I was out of sour cream, so I substituted 6 oz of vanilla Greek yogurt (one of the single serving cups).  I also added 1 cup strong brewed coffee in place of the water.  This was an increase of 1/2 cup of liquid.  My batter was REALLY thick, even with the additional liquid.  It was so beautiful out of the pan I didn't add any glaze or powdered sugar.  This is my new favorite cake and will definitely make it again and again :)

Thought I'd try it even though I hate boxed cake mixes.  Unfortunately, even with all the doctoring, and fancy stuff added...it still tasted like a boxed cake mix.

This recipe was not only quick and easy but also absolutely delicious! I made the cake just as described - no changes to the original recipe - and drizzled a homemade chocolate frosting over it because why not add even more chocolate to an already decadent cake? It got rave reviews from all of my party guests who  requested the recipe (and seconds!).

I have been using this recipe for years and find it works best as cupcakes with a PB vanilla icing. This is often requested as its a huge hit at bake sales and for my decorated cakes n cupcakes. No need to doctor this recipe, don't try changing flavored of cake mix or chips cuz it's just not as good then. Cheap knock of brands do work and are good, but nothing beats Duncan Heinz n nestle chips (reg or mini, both are great). When u did my brothers wedding cake this cleared before the WASC and lemon pound (old family recipe n the bomb lol)

Simple enough for kids to make and it is so moist and delicious.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was amazing, but now I've turned this into my rum cake.  Instead of adding water, I add rum. Makes a great holiday cake.

My husband and I loved this cake! Made no changes to the recipe. I do recommend that you watch the cake the last 10 min, as the sides started getting crispy pretty quick. Overall was a wonderful recipe. I was very surprised by the easiness of it. Will be making again!

I have made this cake several times...but I use 2 small boxes of instant chocolate pudding mix instead on 1 ...The last time I made it I used real butter to generously coat bundt pan(no sticking at all). I have also melted 1/2c butter and 1/2c oil instead of 1 cup oil just for more of a buttery taste...either way this cake is yummy!

I have made a lot of chocolate cakes in my life, for my family. Me myself, I've never been much of a chocolate person, I normally go towards vanilla-baked goods. But, when I made this cake for my dad's birthday, this was the BEST chocolate cake that I ever tasted. I think the semisweet chocolate chips really put this cake over the top! Definetely using this recipe again!

Because I made a shaped cake with this (instead of bundt), it took much longer to bake than the recipe calls for.  When I finally took it out, it was so moist that I was afraid it still wasn't completely done.  It was VERY dense and moist, and I was afraid it would fall apart when I cut it, but it held its shape really well after it cooled.  My son loved his birthday cake!

I make this cake all the time.... anytime I ask what can I bring.... this is what everyone wants... it's really chocolate overload!!!!  I top it with a double recipe of satiny chocolate glaze and practically fill up the hole in the middle with fudgey glaze goo!! it's disgustingly rich but kids (especially my cello students) never get tired of it

I too only used 1/2 cup of oil and one cup of chips (mini), and everyone still raved about how moist it was. I used coconut oil (avoiding canola/corn oils) and substituted half and half for water, added 1 tbls of vanilla. I put the choco chips in my sifter, added some flour and coated them while I floured the bundt pan. Drizzled with white icing, sprinkled with mini chips and chopped almonds. This is a keeper.

My daughter and I baked this cake to take to a party.  Long story short, we stopped at Costco on the way to purchase a chocolate cake.  This cake did not bake at all!  Only the top inch was baked after more than an hour at 350 and yes, the oven works just fine! We removed the cake from the pan after cooling and were shocked to see the goo that came out.  We saved the baked part to put on ice cream, but I have to agree with those who say this is too sweet and artificial tasting.  I am not a chocolate cake lover to begin with, but this is literally too much chocolate. I much prefer cakes made from scratch.

This was one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had and it was so easy.  I used a both a square and round eight inch pan (for a heart for my girlfriend and my anniversary) and mini chocolate chips to melt easier.  I also added the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe from this site which is just 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 3 tbs butter, and a splash of light corn syrup in pyrex in the microwave for 45 sec with 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract after heated.  Finally, I added a raspberry glaze on the plate and I really think it enhanced it that much more.  For the raspberry glaze, I just took some raspberry preserves and added a bit of water and light corn syrup. 

Enjoy!!

Made this cake yesterday and it's phenomenal!!! I'm not sure if I've EVER had better chocolate cake and I am a picky chocolate-cake gal. Followed almost everything w/ the exception of a few items because I use a fancy, very intricate bundt pan with a lot of detail and didn't want to chance a cake that was too gooey or slightly crispy (higher baking temp) for my ornate pan. Used only 1/2 c oil. Used only 1 cup MINI choco chips. And I baked it at 325 degrees for 55 minutes. It tured out beautifully and tasted truly terrific. I simply dusted w/ powdered sugar and added strawberries to the top.

Everyone RAVED about this cake! I can't wait to make it again! Thanks Denise, great job!

I've made this recipe too many times to count!  It's FABULOUS!  I always add one full package of toffee chips to the mix and the richness adds an excellent depth of flavor.  Everyone always comments on how moist the cake is and you never need frosting.  It's definitely a keeper because it's so easy and portable!

Very good and very chocolatey.  My husband who can never have something chocolatey enough for him, actually said "I think this is enough chocolate."  I followed other reviewers suggestions and only used 1/2 c oil and 1/3 c milk instead of 1 c oil to make it lighter.  It was awesome!  Topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website and it tasted gourmet.

The best chocolate cake ever! I have made it will all the oil and with 3/4 cup and don't notice a difference. I do prefer the mini chocolate chips; they float better in the batter instead of falling to the bottom.

Great cake. Made it for my family the other night and they all loved it. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I was a little hesitant about leaving a cake in a Bundt pan for 1 1/1 hours since I thought for sure it wouldn't come out of the pan without a struggle. I actually tried to take it out sooner but it wouldn't  budge. Waited until 1 1/2 hours were up and it came out of the pan without sticking. Will be making this again.

I definitely give this recipe five stars! It was extremely easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I allowed it to cool for 40 min, then jiggled my bundt pan to see if it was ready,(and it was), and when I turned it over it was perfect! I used Duncan Hines Devils Food for the cake mix, and Jello brand chocolate pudding. I recommend PAM spray with flour for baking (ESPECIALLY WITH BUNDT CAKES). My guests absolutely loved the cake. I dusted a light coating of powdered sugar on it, and then served with vanilla bean icecream. Absolute decadence!!

Fabulous chocolate cake just as written! I usually bake my cakes from scratch, but this will be my go to chocolate cake recipe. I used a peanut butter frosting recipe I found on Pinterest and I can't believe the amount of compliments I received.

Simply delicious. I best never make it again because I couldn't stop eating it. I made two little changes: exchange 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup oil and add a teaspoon (or a little more) of almond extract. To die for!

Wow--the name says it all! If you're a serious chocolate lover (like my husband), this is fantastic. For others it might be... well... too much. :) Overall this was pretty good and I'll make it again for my chocoholic friends.

i only had a smaller box of both the devils food cake mix (15 oz) and chocolate pudding mix (3 oz), so I just added a little less than a cup of sour cream and applesauce (instead of oil, cause that's what I had) and a little less than a 1/2 cup water. I put 3 egg whites and one whole egg with yolk. I made cupcakes and baked for 20 minutes. They came out perfect. Frosted with store bought frosting and they were delicious!

When I read the recipe I remembered that this was a popular recipe back in the 1970's - exact same recipe, had it written on a 3x5 card in my recipe box.   Used to make it a lot back when Bundt cakes were the rage.   Always got raves.  You can't go wrong with it.

Definitely lives up to it's billing!  The only variations I did was to use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil and my sour cream was fat free.  I put a chocolate glaze over the top and drizzled down the sides rather than the powdered sugar dusting.  It was an instant hit with my husband who is somewhat picky, and with the rest of the family too.  This one is a keeper.  CDH

I LOVED this cake, and i am not usually a chocolate cake fan! Everyone in my party was highly impressed and we finished the cake for breakfast! Yes, it is super chocolatey, but delicious! The lower star ranks said it didn't cook all the way through, and was chemical tasting... but i strongly dissagree! I even made chocolate sour cream frosting to go with it and it was a HUGE hit! The only change im ade was that i addded a little less oil, but just a little, otherwise followed recipe to a T... bake was perfect, and the chocolate chips didn't sink like some people said they would, maybe bacause i left the batter fairly thick. CAN"T WAIT TO MAKE AGAIN!!!

This cake was great! I baked it for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, and the both of us as well as his parents agreed it was the best cake we've ever had. I accidentally bought a 15oz box of cake mix, but I used 3/4C. Oil and sprinkled in some flour. The cake batter was very spongy and thick; not very "batter"-y like pancake mix or other cupcake mixes I've made. I baked it in two round pans. Like the top review said, the chocolate chips can be deceiving when you test for your cake to be done. I will definitely be making this cake again!

This got great reviews when I served it! I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze. I prefer cakes from scratch, but this is very very good ... and EASY!

Simply dielicious.  I don't even like chocolate cake but this was perfect.  I suggest drizzling condensed milk and sprinkling walnuts to top this treat off.

This is like no cake I have ever made before. I don't bake a lot so this was great because it was easy to make and is delicious. I am a huge chocolate fan and the amount of chocolate is perfect, and the touch of chocolate chips inside is just amazing. I could eat this cake every day. Wonderfully moist and rich, but not too heavy. Even days later, the left overs are not a bit dry. If you like chocolate, eat this cake, you'll be in heaven.

Made just as called for (except I baked 2 rounds for about 20 min). This was tasty and my hubby- who isnt a big cake fan, raved about it. I thought it was a bit more bownie like than cake like. I made a homemade light vanilla frosting so it would cut through some of the richness of this cake. This was a good cake recipe but I personally could go with an even richer cake, like flourless chocolate cake- talk about rich!

1 (18.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix is now obsolete. The cake boxes have changed in size since this recipe was posted.  The 18.25 oz. mix is now 16.25.  Still followed the recipe and the cake is still wonderful.  
Also used the Chocolate Ganache posted from "INGRIDEVOGEL" to Allrecipes as a topping, minus the rum. Drizzled about half to the top of the cake.
Both recipes are very easy. 
Thanks to Denise and Ingridevogel for posting both of these.

Like this needs another review, right? Just have to say that I made this cake for the first time, using red velvet cake mix and about a cup and a half semi-sweet chocolate chips. other than that, I followed the recipe and amounts exactly (using a 3.9 box of chocolate pudding...wasn't sure there, and topped with the satiny chocolate glaze), and this cake should be called "the best chocolate cake ever." Yum! Perfect taste and texture...very moist, and is great served at room temperature or straight out of the fridge. It's a definite keeper as a base recipe. I am looking forward to trying other flavor variations of this cake. :)

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner's dessert.  Although I cook and bake all of the time, it was actually my first chocolate cake to make from scratch.  Everyone loved it!  And I loved making it!  I have trouble frosting cakes so drizzling chocolate on a perfectly formed bundt cake worked fabulously and was very impressive.  I followed the directions exactly, after watching the wonderfully helpful and comforting associated video.  The only thing I did was melt half milk chocolate and half semisweet morsels in a little cup, transferred the melted chocolate to a ziploc with the corner cut off, and drizzled chocolate on top to make it look like one of the pictures-- this part is non-negotiable!  This recipe is simply awesome.

Deee-licious!! I tried this for my mother's birthday. I made it in two 8" round pans, so it only took about 35 minutes to cook. I stacked the two cakes, put a mixture of cool whip/cocoa/ powdered sugar in between it all, and topped it with a simple chocolate glaze. Decorated it with mnm's, and voila... a delicious, extremely chocolatey cake. It was good the first day, and it was good the second day. Didn't last longer than three days in a house of three people!

I should have believed the bad reviews, but the outstanding ones were the majority so I made this for a dinner party tonight. I don't think I will even bring it with me - I am making another dessert instead. It just would not cook. 75 minutes and I still don't trust that the cake is baked inside.

Don't look any further. Just do this. It's amazing. My family raved and raved about how good it was! My 90-year-old grandfather, who's probably had many, many cakes in his lifetime, said it was the best chocolate cake he's ever tasted. No one will ever know that you used a cake mix. I don't have a big enough Bundt pan, so I used a round springform pan, greased and floured with cocoa powder. Baked at 350 for about 60-65 minutes. Like many of the reviewers, I made Satiny Chocolate Glaze and poured it on top for an incredible finish. AMAZING.

I have made this cake several times now! EVERYONE that tries it loves it and I always direct them to this site for the recipe. I typically use a chocolate satin glaze over it and it is always a hit. GREAT recipe Denise, you deserved your award!

I have been making this wonderful cake for years with just a few minor changes. Instead of 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of warm water, I use 1/2 cup of oil and a 1/2 cup of water. I use a small package of instant chocolate pudding and mini chocolate chips. I have made this cake many times using mini loaf pans to give for Christmas presents to neighbors and friends. This cake is very delicious and moist and freezes well.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes and they were delicious!  Changes: I used 2/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup half & half and 1/2 cup brewed coffee instead of water.  They baked for 30 minutes.  I let the kids ice them with store-bought frosting but I am looking forward to making this as a cake next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and it's perfect. Don't change a thing. I used low fat sour cream and that's the only revision I made. I made chocolate ganache (1 cup whipping cream, 9 oz. semisweet chocolate bits) and poured over this beautiful bundt cake. It was amazing. We took it to a restaurant for a birthday dinner and the employees of the restaurant wanted the recipe. It's rich and chocolatey for sure, but with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is absolutely divine.

Excellent recipe followed exaclty but baked 1 hr at 
325 degrees.  I used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site and then placed fresh raspberries cut in half and placed them all along the top which was perfect in using as a guide  for cutting each piece!  Will be making this again..

I made this recipe as written it was fantastic so moist and yummy. It didn't need any frosting at all although I did make 1/2 my cupcakes with chocolate chocolate chip icing. For my daughters birthday I tried french vanilla cake with vanilla pudding and 2 cups mini chocolate chips it turned out fantastic as well.

used 12 oz bag of mini semisweet chocolate chips instead of 2 cups regular sized semisweet chocolate chips.  (they're lighter & dont sink to the bottom as bad - so they hold their "place" throughout the cake more & melt evenly throughout.)

DEFINITELY a keeper.  AWESOME, MOIST cake.  probably the most moist cake i have ever made.  DELICIOUS.

Made this cake with my 4 year old son and I let him do everything on his own except use the oven... It was a perfect cake. Extremely simple and yummy.

My sister made this cake for me for my birthday and it was wonderful.  I'm sure it would have been great with the powdered sugar on top but she made a chocolate buttercream icing.  It is probably the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten

Today will be the third time I am making this cake. The first time I didn't really read the reviews and had to deal with the chocolate chips sinking to the bottom (top) of the bundt cake. The second time around, I read the reviews and came out with the winning idea of the mini chocolate chips. Also, when I make a cake (especially a doctored one like this) the best way I have found to get the cake to come out lovely is to grease the pan (with whatever you feel comfortable with) and then take a little bit of the dry mix and coat the pan with that (just roll it around in the pan and then add it back to the dry mix. It does WONDERS, you just HAVE to let the cake cool. You must, you must, you must! You can use the full amount of oil and 2 cups of chocolate chips and there won't be any "crusty sides" or "sinking chocolate."

I never take the time to write reviews, but this has made my all time hit list. Everyone asks for it. I tried it this week for cupcakes for my daughter's school and they were gone in a flash with butter cream frosting. 20 minutes in the oven same temp. Have fun!

In my family the birthday cake to have was a Dairy Queen ice cream cake. Not any more! I made this for my sons birthday this year and everyone has requested this cake for their birthdays from now on. Only thing I did differently was bake it in a 13 by 9 baking dish and then frosted it with "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting". The recipe for that is also on allrecipes.com. Great great great cake!

This turned out great, reminded me of a very good brownie - only much larger :) I followed the recipe mostly, although noticed that it called for 18.25oz cake mix, and 5.9oz pudding mix - what I bought at the store was 16.5oz cake mix, and 3.9 oz pudding mix - so I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup as another reviewer noted, I also chopped up the chocolate chips in a food processor and it turned out perfect! I used the "satiny chocolate glaze" (also from this site) as well, and everyone loved it..

So delicious and moist and well, chocolatey! I topped it with a cool whip chocolate ganache and it was all the rage at the potluck I took it too. Like mentioned by a few other reviewers, I used mini chocolate chips and cut the oil down to 3/4 cups and it turned out perfect.  This will now be my go-to recipe for potlucks, family gatherings, or just when I really, really want something super chocolatey :)

I have used this recipe for over a year now. LOVE IT. You can substitute Mayo or Miracle Whip for the Sour cream if you need to. It tastes the same. All three of those ingredients are to make sure it stays moist. You can use a cup of any in any cake recipe. You can also plastic wrap your cake after it cools and freeze it. Then just pull it out and set it on the counter still wrapped until it thaws usually 3 hours.

Perfect chocolate cake!!! Does not need frosting, just gave it a dusting of powder sugar prior to serving. Served with ice cream and strawberries...I live at 6200' and had to make a few adjustments, added 2 Tbls. flour and decreased the oil to 2/3 cup. Also used mini chocolate chips as others had stated. Turned out better than perfect if that is possible!!!

Yum!  Cut the vegetable oil out and used unsweetened applesauce and light sour cream to make this cake the teeniest bit "healthy".  Added strawberries, raspberry, and sugar-free whip cream when served.

This cake alone was ok.  I followed the recipe almost exactly... instead of Devil's Food Cake I used Duncan Hines Chocolate Fudge cake.  Everyone else liked the cake, I felt like it tasted like a box cake. I'll say this though, I iced it with cream cheese icing, topped it with the chocolate ganache recipe found on this site and garnished it with white chocolate chips...that combination with the cake and after sitting for a day, made the cake very tasty!

This was a huge success.  I used a store brand mix since most of the name brands are no longer 18.25 ounces.  I followed the recipe exactly using regular size chips, I did hold a few back to sprinkle on top since someone said they sank.  I didn't seem to have an issue with that though.  I let it cool an hour and it came out of the pan easily.  I had oiled the pan very well.   I sprinkled the top with powdered sugar.  I may try some icing next time.  I made cherry crisp for sme gathering and some people ate the two together.  We served it with ice cream.

Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm! THis cake is amazing, very chocolatey! I must say I did substitute applesauce for the oil and sugar free pudding mix.  I did however have a hard time knowing when it was done cooking bc the chocolate chips were melty and gooey.  I stabbed the cake with a fork a few times right after coming out of the oven and I poured chocolate syrup all over it....Holy Cow!! YUM

Super.  I'm an American living in London so I my first problem was cake mixes are scarce, but my nearby large store did have them.  I had to do without chocolate chips (as they come in tiny bags with high price tags) and thought I'd have to do without pudding (which they don't have here) but found one in the cabinet we brought from home.  Oh the troubles I face here ;)

I halved the oil and added a mashed banana.  It was perfect.  I also "Britishized" it by using 2 round cake pans and did a layer of jelly ("jam") in the middle and powdered sugar on top.  It pained me to skip out on the frosting but actually this was delicious.  Will def do again.

Terrific! My family has been making this cake since the 70's and it's still everyone's favorite (although I'm unsure if they used the sour cream in it). This was the first time I personally made it and it was great. I substituted the sour cream for greek yogurt, used sugar free pudding, and topped with powdered sugar. Amazing! Thanks!

5 stars!  Awesome cake and SOOO easy. Doesn't taste like it was from a box of cake mix and pudding mix and if I hadn't told anyone at the party how I made it everyone would have thought that it had been slaved over for HOURS!  Every person that had cake commented on how good it was.  I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze as other reviewers suggested (from allrecipes).  Since it's summer, I put the cake (covered) in the fridge in fear that it would just start melting once I put the glaze on, but since the glaze is made of chocolate chips it got very hard on top, so I had to let it sit out for about 20-30 minutes before serving.  I don't think I'll put it in the fridge the next time I make it.  Especially if it's not in the Summer. Other than that wouldn't do anything differently. Thinking about trying with different cake mixes and pudding flavors as others suggested.  Wonderful recipe!

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever made or had hands down!  I brought it to a picnic still in the bunt pan and people were eating it out of the pan before I could put it on a plate!

I had my doubts as the batter was quite thick looking but I was pleasantly surprised!  This is definitely a keeper.

This cake was really good. I made it in a 9x11 glass pan. Previous reviews told me to put a little bit less oil, so I did. It came out a little bit dry and I think the extra oil would have done it good.

I have made this recipe several times, and I don't change a thing.  I get requests for this cake all the time.  It is very moist, and has the best flavor of any chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  It is great both heated and at room temp.

This is a five star recipe! However I did not follow the recipe as written (I know what you're thinking!). I did not want to go to the store so I used what I had. I used a 3.4 oz box of vanilla pudding mix and a 6 oz. container of fat free plain greek yogurt instead of the chocolate pudding and sour cream. I also scaled down the wet ingredients a tad to compensate for the decreased amount of dry ingredients. It turned out amazing! I made them into cupcakes, baked them for about 14 minutes on convection. They turned out like the "perfect" cupcake! They rose nicely and were moist and chocolatey!

Seriously one of THE BEST cakes that I have ever made.  Drizzled white and dark chocolate over it; garnished with strawberries.  Made this for my mom's family birthday party.  It was so simple to make and really, truly delicious.  Higly recommended!

I have made this cake about ten or twelve times it is great.  I have learned that you can make it as cup cakes and bake for 35 to 40 minutes and I use the Duncan Hines Glaze and I am ready.

The cake was good overall, but it was a little bit greasy. It probably doesn't need quite that much oil.

The title is absolutely correct. This recipe is extremely chocolaty. It kinda reminded me of brownies at first. Great recipe for the chocolate lover. I had to cook it a little longer than what was stated.

This is an awesome cake. It came out so moist!  When it said to pour the batter into the pan, mine just sort of flopped into the pan. lol It kind of scared me that I had did it wrong but the cake turned out great. So if you are wondering if you did it right when the batter flops into the pan, dont worry. Mine did the same. When eating the cake for fathers day, all i could think was that the cake needed a more chocolate flavor. I found that the flavor was almost subdued. I am going to try this recipe again with a different chocolate cake. Maybe a milk chocolate. I might add Chocolate liquor or something that will boost the flavor.  Otherwise this a great recipe. Thanks.

Even though I've used many recipes from this site, I've never left a review, but I thought I just had to for this wonderful cake!  The only substitution I made was using applesauce instead of oil (which I do in all my baking).  I used someone's idea of melting chocolate frosting and drizzling it over the cake and it was fantastic!!
I made this for my daughter's birthday and everyone raved about it!!!

I followed the recipe exactly. It baked beautifully and looked great, and even tasted all right. But it was too oily for my tastes. There was a very noticeable film of oil on the plate or fingers after eating it. It was too much for me - and I have a high tolerance for fatty foods.

I WOULD use this recipe again (I want to!), but I would follow the advice of others and DEFINITELY halve the oil - and maybe add applesauce to replace the liquid.

This was delicious.  I made the changes recommended and it was perfect.  I made chocolate dipped strawberries for the garnish.  The whole thing was a hit.  The only thing to be aware of is that my cake turned out more like a giant chocolate fudge brownie than a cake consistancy.  That's not a complaint on my part.  I could eat the entire thing myself, but it's good to know going into it.  This obviously was super duper easy too, with the mixes.

Oh my this was awesome!!! Used mini chips. It was a very thick batter. Next time I will underbake it a bit so it can cool in the bundt pan and I can turn it onto a plate the next day when ready to serve. This will be my new get together cake!

Ahhhhmazing!!!! I followed this recipe to the T except I used two 3.9 oz packages of pudding, (couldn't find a 5.9 oz package) The best cake I have ever had. I also used the satiny chocolate from this site. Great together.

Not as moist as I was hoping. Next time I think I'll stick to the original amount of oil (only 1/4 cup more). Otherwise, everyone raved about it!

So chocolatey!  exactly what I was looking for in a celebratory VERY chocolate cake.  I made one alteration:  i substituted half of the vegetable oil for an orange-infused canola oil.  Oh my!!  Lots of oohs and aahs!  This recipe is a keeper! :)

Made this for an office birthday.  We warmed the cake pieces in the microwave for 20 - 30 seconds. It was the best - don't forget to serve with milk.

This is the BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE! I made this cake a doz. times. I even made this cake as part of my daughters four tear wedding cake. People keep asking me to make that awsome chocolate cake.. Try it and I bet you will never use another recipe for choc. cake again! The only thing I did different was I grated Chocolate bark in the batter instead of using chocolate chips, I always double the recipe and find the chips sink to the bottom of my 4 inch deep pans and tend to burn.

This was a good moist chocolate cake.  I did a nice glaze to drizzle on top, because I felt that frosting would be too much.

This taste is amazing. If you are craving chocolate and really want that chocolatey taste, you need to try this cake. I lowered it by one star because it was very dense and almost too chocolatey if that's possible. I like a more light and fluffy cake, but that's personal preference. Everyone I made it for loved it.

I used this recipe to make a dinosaur-shaped cake for my son's second birthday. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used mini semisweet chocolate chips. It came out beautifully. Making the cake was the simple part. I baked one day, iced the next, and served on the third. Everyone loved the flavor, including my 2-year-old. I will make this again, though I think I'll choose a less labor-intensive preparation.

Awesome recipe.  Took readers advise and used 3/4 cp of applesauce instead of oil and only used 1 1/4 cp of semisweet morsels and chopped them.  Came out great.

I would give this 6 stars if I could! The best chocolate cake ever. I try to find dark chocolate chips as they make the cake even more decadent. I usually use store-bought chocolate glaze or frosting. I have used it as a bundt cake as well as for a sheet cake decorated for a birthday cake (much better than a box cake mix and just as easy with the few extra ingredients!), and even cupcakes. Everyone who has tried it has loved it!

I made this and accidently had too little cake mix but still it turned out good. Everybody who tried it loved it. I added a little bit of mini chocolate chips and it was even better! I suggest the mini chocolate chips for more chocolate (you can't get enough in my option) and texture. It was AMAZING!!!

I've made this one at least 15 times now since I first tried it - it is our go-to cake when chocolate cake is requested.  I always use a bag of mini chocolate chips so they don't sink.  They disperse evenly and perfectly in the cake.  Otherwise, I make it just as per recipe.  It's an amazing cake!  Dense and almost brownie-like which is perfect for my family who much prefers brownies over most cakes.

My husband is not a chocolate cake fan but I made this one he loved it. Even requested it again. I have since made it for several occasions, I love that it's so simple. And as far as I am concerned you can never have "Too much chocolate"!

When I'm trying a recipe for the first time I always follow the recipe the way it's written before rating it. This cake is AMAZING!!! I made it exactly like it says and won't ever change anything well I will play with different pudding and cake mixes as per another reviewer. This is a keeper...thank you for a wonderful recipe! Updated** Made with confetti cake and vanilla pudding adding white chocolate chips with a vanilla glaze (from this site)....WOW!!! Making again for Easter. You have to try it!!

I thought the final product was just okay.  Nothing special considering all the extras added to the cake mix.  I wouldn't make it again.

I used this recipe for cupcakes and they were great.  I used low fat sour cream and 3/4 c. of oil.  I might try using 1/2 c. of oil next time.  I omitted chocolate chips because it seemed like "too much chocolate" lol.  I filled the cupcake pan 3/4 full and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  They were delicious.

I made this cake for my brother-in-law's birthday (he's a chocoholic) and it was an absolute hit! I used the healthy tips listed in an above review to make the cake a little healthier. The cake was healthier and still tasted great! Instead of putting chocolate or powdered sugar on the top, I used caramel ice cream syrup. The cake soaked it in like a sponge and added a whole new level of flavor. This is definitely recipe I will be keeping.

Been making this cake for awhile now to rave reviews, always a hit and you can keep the ingredients on hand. You can try variations of cake mix/ pudding (yellow cake mix w/ vanilla pudding, choc cake w/  cookies n cream pudding, etc.). Using 2 small boxes of pudding (vs 1 lg box) works fine, and mini chips DO work the best. I have omitted the chips before and sometimes get a cake that falls, sometimes does not??

I made this yesterday, but I decided not to put in the chips and I used a 'mousse' instant pudding. It was absolutely delicious, moist and very chocolaty. I put melted Cadbury's chocolate for the frosting, and it was heaven. A GREAT recipe I will make again and again !

The original recipe is fool proof as is.  I'm making this cake again this weekend ... but I am going to up the amount of chocolate chips :-)  I also like the idea of whipped cream and strawberries as sides. (Instead of a glaze). "We only live once".

Perfect recipe for cupcakes too - didn't have to change anything, and made 24 overflowing cupcakes.  I am a cupcake decorator - I can make an awesome looking cupcake, but had long ago given up using anything other than box mixes.  My husband and I have already eaten a few of them, they're delicious, and I just realized I hadn't even frosted them yet.

I give this 5 stars, it was delicious. I read all the lower reviews, just to see if people changed it. Well I used 3/4 cup oil, and could have used the whole cup, not that its dry or anything. (: I made mine with a butterscotch sauce. I made it with 1 3/4 cups heavy whipping cream, 2 1/2 tbsp powdered sugar, and a full bag (12 oz.) of butterscotch chips. I brought the heavy cream to a simmer, took it off the heat and added the chips, stirred until it was almost melted, and put it back on low heat and stirred until it bubbled, added the sugar and stirred about 4 more minutes. Then I took it off and put it in a container and put it in the fridge for about 1 hour and glazed the cake with it. (: Delicious. And this recipe is so versatile! I love this recipe. So does my Mom in law, and my son! :D

First time writing a review on anything and my first time  making a bunt cake with box cake mix. Its the best chocolate cake ever!!! You really have to like chocolate because its very sweet and its awesome with vanilla ice cream.
Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.
Our family, friends and coworkers loved it!

This cake was awesome!!  There were some baker-errors though (oops!) so there are defintely things that I would change. I used a regular circle cake pan and adjusted the cooking time...which I won't be doing next time because the center was still un-done when I took it out.  However, even with that mistake my 2 pregnant girlfriends LOVED it...as did I.  The sour cream really helps cut the richness and that chocolate overload taste.  And, as other reviewers suggested I used mini choco chips.  This was fantastic...I will definitely be making this again!!

Unreal!  A delicious cake that everyone loved.  The only thing I did different was to use mini semi sweet chips.  Thank you for an easy, fool proof recipe.

This was so easy to throw together and came out very good. I warmed it up for a few seconds before serving it for dessert with some vanilla icecream and my boys devoured it :-) Ill definitely make this again!

I've been making this for 30 years.  Really!  I take it to another level by whipping a quart of whipped cream for a thick and lovely frosting.  Out of this world.  It's hands down the best chocolate cake ever.

Im surprised at how many people loved this. I did this recipe exactly as written and I thought it was ok but dry. I did cook it for the full 55 minutes so maybe that could have contributed to the dryness. Noone in the house loved it, they all said it tastes like a regular boxed chocolate cake...nothing special.

I've made this for about 3 years now and every year it gets better. I like to slice it and sprinkle powdered sugar over it. It looks and tastes delicious.

My husband LOVED this cake. I am not a chocolate cake lover, but he is and he ranted and raved about this cake over and over again! He even called me at work to tell me how much he loved it. Anything that will make my husband this happy is a winner in my book and deserves five stars ! If he ever asks for a chocolate cake again, I will make sure I make this one. I omitted the chocolate chips and added a chocolate drizzle on top, but next time I will leave the chocolate chips and omit the drizzle and I know it will be yummy! Thanks!

You can't go wrong with this chocolate cake.  If you do, please step away from the oven and don't return.  It's so easy to make and delicious everytime.  I'd give this recipe 10 stars if that was an option!

I'm not a huge chocolate fan, nor do I like chocolate chips in my desserts, but this cake has changed my mind on both fronts!! It is an AMAZINGLY fantastic cake. I couldn't find my bundt ban so I made a 2-layer cake and frosted it with chocolate icing, and it was heaven.

YUMMY!!! I made this cake in two 9" round cake pans and they were perfect!! For frosting I used the frosting recipe from the "Sandy's Chocolate Cake" recipe (submitted by Sandra Johnson). What an unbelievable combination. My family members were licking their plates clean! My husband and uncle haven't stopped talking about this cake for weeks. What a success!

This is an excellent cake, especially when combined with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe on the site. Baking time should be closer to 50 than 55 minutes. (NB. The cake goes from perfectly done to burnt within a very small time window. Beware.)

Absolutely Delicious.I have not make box cakes in years, but after reading reviews decided to give it a try.  Amazing flavors and decadent is all I can say!
After reading reviews I did purchase the "decadent chocolate" mix which comes with extra goodness and the outcome was outrageous.  This is a "soft cake" so follow directions and allow to rest in pan several hours before transferring to plate.  I served with fresh whipped cream with a splash of Kahlua. This will be one of my favorite recipes. Great flavor, and so easy to put together.

Very chocolatey -- I made the cake from the recipe exactly as written.  It tastes very good, but I was not happy with the "box cake" taste.  I used Duncan Hines devils food cake mix.  I would like to know if anyone out there has any experience with substituting a devils food cake recipe instead of using a box cake mix.

HELP!  I made this cake last night and followed the recipe exactly.  I used a bundt pan and even though after 55 mins, a toothpick came out clean, my cake kind of separated into chunks on the top and when cooled and cut, the inside was very gooey..like undercooked and wet.  Or was it the pudding?  The cake had a GREAT taste but what did I do wrong with the undercooked appearance once cut?  I'd like to try again but don't know what to fix.

Ok, so after reading almost half of the reviews I was hesitant to use the full cup of oil.  I used only 3/4 cup and 1/4 milk and this actually just tasted like a boxed cake mix.  Use the full cup of oil!!  I added 3/4 cup mini chips and 1/2 cup of peppermint chip for holiday flare and the small bits of peepermint  you get are great!  Was expecting a fabulous cake and would say its only so so.

This recipe is amazing! I used mini chocolate chips and it's a little chocolate in every bite. I made it without chocolate chips and it was delicious but the chocolate chips really makes a difference. 

If I make it with chocolate chips, I don't use icing. I once mixed all the ingredients without the eggs, I simply forgot. I then added in the eggs and this method gave me a very moist cake.

I am going to use this formula for all box cake mixes!

I usually feel like I'm "cheating" if I don't make a cake from scratch, but as far as doctored cake mixes go, this is fabulous!  It is ridiculously rich and chocolaty and so YUMMY!  I made it as a sheet cake and topped it with the Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site and it was just over the top then!

AHHHH-MAZING!!! I am not a baker.  I am a cook.  Most things I bake never turn out well.  I followed this recipe exactly, and it is AH-Mazing.  I will be making this cake again and agian.  The used a Duncan Hines Creamy Choc icing, I warmed it on the stoved and spooned it all over the cake.  It made it extra moist.  I also used mini-chips intstead of choc chips (I don't know if that made a difference or not, but the mini chips were completely melted into the cake).  I'm sure serving it warm with vanilla icecream would be divine.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Excellent chocolate cake! 'Tis the second best chocolate cake that I ever have eaten! The sour cream makes it most and the pudding mix gives it extra chocolate flavor.

The first time i made this I didn't have a devil's food cake so I used a moist chocolate cake mix. Didn't have sour cream so I used plain yogurt.  I used 1/2c oil and 1/2c apple sauce.  Turned out fantastic.  Very moist, very yummy.  Making this again tonight and will tweak again based on what's in the fridge and pantry!

Absolutely delicious!  Tasted great after sitting in the fridge and then eating it chilled. Chocolate chips hardened up and could really taste them. My daughter loves chocolate and went crazy over this cake.

So deliciously moist! For a sweet tooth like me, this recipe is perfect! Its all the rage with all of my freshmen buddies! They repeatedly asked for this cake for their birthdays! At church this Sunday we're having a Thanks Giving feast! I offered to make dessert and our Pastor specifically asked for this recipe after its big success on the 4th of July! This cake is no doubt the BEST I've ever made! It's my mom's favorite too!

I have tried many many chocolate cake recipes and this one...takes the cake!  It's perfect as it is, but I frosted it with chocolate buttercream for a heavenly birthday cake for my sister.  This is a rich, moist and delicious cake and will be my go to chocolate cake from now on!

Hubs, who is very much a vanilla-lover, said this was the best chocolate cake he has had. I did cut back on the oil and used only a half-cup but added a half-cup of plain applesauce for balance. Very good cake, really yum.

Oh my chocolaty goodness! This chocolate cake definitely deserves it´s name. It is sooo chocolaty and moist, but not too sweet and too much. My family loved it even my dad, who isn´t really fond of cakes, said that he liked it and was surprised about the cake´s moistness. Éven one slice is very filling and rich, so it is hard to finish such a cake in a household with just 3 people, but for birthdays or other partys I guess it is perfect and everybody will love it!

Love love love this recipe! Has quickly become a family favorite in my house! I use dark chocolate chips and melt bakers chocolate squares with a little milk to drizzle over the top. I warm a slice up for 30 sec in the microwave and serve with a scoop of ice cream and it's heaven on a plate!

Cake was delicious. I substituted the warm water and used warm coffee instead. Coffee really brings out the taste of the chocolate. It was perfect!

Love love love this cake! I dont understand those that gave it 1 star and said it tastes chemically? This cake was amazingly moist, baked perfectly and was devoured by all. The ONLY change I'd make is for mini-choco chips. The regular sink. Otherwise made just as directed. PERFECT and wonderfully chocolate!

Sooo good...oooey gooey!  You can taste the pudding and the chocolate chips.  Great for a cake or cupcake.  I've also used it with a whipped ganache filling and ganache glaze.  This is my "go to" chocolate recipe.

You must love chocolate to like this cake.  I made it for a birthday cake & frosted instead of dusting with icing sugar.  The kids really liked it.  I will try this recipe again but next time, I  will only add 1 cup of chocolate chips.

This is a fantastic recipe! It was so moist and it got rave reviews at the party I made it for. The only thing I did differently was use mini chocolate chips and cut the amount of those in half. Absolutely delicious! You cannot lose with this recipe!

I made mini cupcakes with this (without the chips, baking for only 15 minutes) and it was great!

I made this exactly as written and everyone who has ever had a slice says it is the best cake they have ever eaten. I didn't put the powdered sugar on top....this needs nothing on it!!!! It is that good!!
It is not too sweet but it is very yummy indeed!! Thanks for sharing  :)

I was afraid of using 1 cup of oil because there are a number of reviews that say it really is just too much. So, I a little over 3/4 cup. I don't have a bundt pan and I didn't want to use a regular rectangular 9X13, so I used a cupcake tin. A half hour for a tray of 12 was perfect. Also, I forgot to mix the chips in, so I put them on top. It was good, would have been so much better if the chips were throughout, as the recipe calls for; would have been more choco-riffic! Also, I made a white chocolate glaze and drizzled it on the top. They were a hit! I will definitely make it again ;D

My daughter made this for my birthday. I didn't even know she could bake. I used to be the Cake Queen of the family but, after this recipe, the crown must go to her. There's chocolate out the wazoo here so, if you have a big 'chocolate jones,' this recipe is for you!! (And she says it's SO easy!!!)

Just change the name now to "To Die For...Only Chocolate Cake Needed".  We live in high altitude (7000 ft) and didn't make one change and the cake came out perfectly moist, nice height...perfect.  Yum, yum, yum.

This has been a great hit in my house.  I tried frosting the first one and it was TOOO sweet.  Much better with powdered suger and cut in small pieces.  This time I'm trying a coffee glaze.

I love chocolate. I love cake but I did not like this recipe. Too much oil for my taste, maybe if you cut down on the oil like others suggested?  I would not make it again unless I incorporated some changes like others suggested

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever made! We don't have a bundt pan so just lower the heat to 325 and put it in a 9' pan for about 45 mins. Top with vanilla buttercream icing...delish!!

I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1 cup of chopped strawberries (folded in after the cake was mixed) along with the choc. chips (but I only used about 1 cup of chips).  Sliced it, surrounded it with fresh sliced strawberries, and drizzled a little bit of strawberry sauce (fresh strawberrys pureed with sugar to tastes) over it when I served it.  Fabulous, lots of compliments, and many requests for the recipe.  Don't add any frosting or powdered sugar- the sauce will add that bit of sugar kick, and the strawberries really set off the chocolate taste.

This cake was excellent. I did change one thing.  Instead of the water, I used coffee. Coffee does enhance the chocolate taste. I used the satiny chocolate glaze from this site which was good and I crumbled reeses over the top. Next time I may try to add something different. I would like to add butterscotch chips with the chocolate chips to the cake and melt them separately and drizzle those too. I had a cake similar to this and it was incredible. Definitely had alot of takers on this recipe. Very rich and good.

This cake was delicious! I undercooked it by like 10 minutes... and it came out all gooey and we served it with vanilla ice cream. It tasted like a molten chocolate cake... I will be using this recipe from now on... nothing else compares.

I had a box of devils food cake mix and no frosting, so I decided to make this. Def does not need frosting. This is how I modified it with what I had available, I only had 1-3 oz package of instant choc pudding mix, 1/3 cup low fat sour cream, 1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1/2 vege oil, 1/3 milk, 3 eggs, 1 egg whites, 1 cup semisweet choc chip, 1 cup white choc chips. So I cut the calories back unintentionally in some areas, but you would NEVER know it! Excellent!

I've made this recipe for years and it is amazing.  Super easy (my 10 year old loves to make it), great presentation and the chocolatey goodness melts in your mouth.  What's not to love? I always keep the ingredients on hand in case I need dessert in a pinch.

This cake recipe is so easy, and the cake is amazing with or without icing.  I LOVED it so much I made 3 in one week to give to friends.  It is super indulgent though so watch out.. you'll want to eat it all yourself!

My whole family loves this cake.  It's an easy, good dessert when pressed for time.  I prefer homemade chocolate cake though, so I didn't care as much for it.  It definitely has a box mix taste.

This is an awesome cake.  I used greek fat free yogurt in place of the sour cream to save a few calories and it turned out great.

Hi, I tryed this cake twice the first time 50 mins was too long and burn the cake. I use two circle pans it was still edible but I didnt like the chocolate chips!! So the second time was a 10 star!!! I used 1 10x13 pan and it took 50 mins without burning very moist but the best thing was I took the chocolate chips and throw them in my blender!!! So I wouldnt bite into big chunks of chocolate... This was very good. I used it for cake with glaze and also "Death By Chocolate" very yummy and satisfating.. Thanks again for a keeper God BLess for sharing  :)

Well, we girls do love our chocolate and this cake won't disappoint.  Be very aware: it is very rich!  This recipe is so requested, I make sure I have the ingredients on hand at all times so when I am asked to bring something, I can say 'yes' without delay on what to make.  I have experimented with different cake mixes and baking chip flavors and all experiments turned out above and beyond my expectation--and never once did my husband get a left over slice of cake or crumbs left on the cake plate.   Be creative in experimenting with this recipe, it is fun and surprising how much you will learn about the blend-ability of ingredient flavors.

This cake is AMAZING!!  I baked this for an event at my church and got rave reviews!  Several older ladies asked for the recipe. And if you are a church going person you know that older ladies never asks a younger lady for a recipe.  In fact I had the recipe printed and in my bag and my mom pulled it out printed copies and gave it to several ladies right there!  She was proud!  Last week I was at another church event and the cake was there!  I must have given the recipe to 4 different people just from making it one time!  

This Recipe is MAGICAL!  Enjoy!

Amazing recipe.  I made it with chocolate fudge cake mix and baked it in two round pans to create a 4-layer cake.  I frosted the cake with a plain, vanilla butter cream icing.  It *might* be the best cake we've ever had.

Be careful when you insert a toothpick to see if it comes out clean.  The melted chocolate chips will coat the toothpick making you think it is not ready.

This cake is terrific. I made it for a birthday gathering and received many compliments. The only changes I made were to use fat free sour cream and reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup.  Next time I'll try to reduce the amount of oil as suggested by other reviewers.  Topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze and chopped walnuts. I can't see any reason to ever use another recipe.  Thanks for a great cake!

Everyone commented on how moist the cake was! A few could tell that it had boxed cake mix in it, which was a bit disappointing, but overall it went over very well.

Delish!  I baked it 55 mins but I think it needed baked another 5-10 mins.  I did half mini chips and half regular sized chips, and I think next time I will do all regular sized ones.  The little ones were all melted and it made me feel like the cake wasn't done.  Very good and very chocolaty :)

WOW. My husband took a piece about 1/5 of the entire cake. He quickly realized that this was too darn rich to eat that much! Anyway, the batter is more like a dough, so I didn't have a problem with my chocolate chips all sinking to the bottom. I will make this for the next potluck or family gathering that I have. It's delicious if you're craving something super chocolate-y!

Thisis the most moist and delicious cake I have ever had! I have made it twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was great but to rich for me to be able to finish my slice so the 2nd time around I just left out the chocolate chips and It was delicious! I like this recipe so much that When I get married Im having a part of my cake strictly dedicated to this recipe! I also uses Icing from the store that you can mely in the microwave and it worked out perfectly.

This is a DELICIOUS cake for being so easy. I followed the recipe, only thing I did was reduce the choc. chips to 1 cup. I was worried it would be way too chocolatey but it wasn't and next time I will add the full amount.  For some reason in my bundt pan it took about 10 minutes longer to cook than recipe states. didn't have problems with the edges being crunchy however they were slightly drier than the middle which was no big deal and totally not noticable. I drizzled some white icing that was sold in a bottle next to the Devil's Food cake mix. That added a nice finish. I think I'll use this recipe for my son's 3rd b-day party!

Great recipe. I made it for my fathers birthday and as soon as she had a bite, my mother said I had to make it for her birthday as well. I top it with a chocolate ganache to make it extra extra chocolaty. Love it.

Maybe I did something wrong, the cake came out very crumbly. The flavor was OK, not what I was hoping for. I brought this for a lunch party at my friends house with lot of kids, had plenty leftover. Here is what I did. I used Pillsbury devil food cake with 1 cup of chocolate pudding in the mix. Everything else I followed as written, except I only added 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. I baked it in a 9' bundt pan for exactly 1 hour. This got so many great reviews. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wonderful!  Made exactly as directed, except using mini chocolate chips instead of regular chips, as someone else had suggested.  I used an electric mixer, and the batter was so thick, I thought I had made a mistake in using the mixer instead of a whisk.  It baked beautifully though!  I also inadvertently bought devil's food cake with pudding in the mix, so I worried how it would turn out.  It was wonderful!  I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze, as someone else had suggested.  It didn't drizzle as nicely as I had hoped, but it didn't look bad and it was quite tasty.  Next time, I might try using shortening in the glaze instead of butter, in hopes that the glaze will be a bit smoother.  This will probably be my dessert of choice for potlucks.  At a recent gathering, everyone wanted the recipe.  It was nice to be able to refer them to this website.

I made this cake for my family this weekend and it was a HUGE hit!  We all love chocolate cake but t his recipe was AWESOME!  I can't wait to make it again.  If I had one criticism, it would be that I felt like the batter was to thick...so I added just a little more water.  It still turned out perfect!

Absolutely delicious! I made this recipe as cupcakes for my daughter's birthday with vanilla pudding mix instead of chocolate to mix up the flavours (baked for 21 minutes and came out perfect). Will definitely use this recipe again for cakes and cupcakes!

Awesome! This is my go to cake for all birthdays now.  I used the mini chocolate chips and use coffee instead of water.  It is great with either Butter Cream Frosting I or Satiny Chocolate Galze.

This an awesome recipe!  My husband and youngest daughter are not big chocolate or dessert fans for that matter and this is the only cake they ever request. I just dust it with powdered sugar.

Made this cake the other day.  Was excellent!  Made a few changes to lower the fat as suggested by another review, used applesauce in place of oil and fat free sour cream.  Also used strong coffee in place of the water as suggested by another review.  The cake was so moist-I will make this cake again!

I'm usually not so great at baking, but I seemed to of aced this cake! I got rave reviews. Made in a 13x9 pan and topped with buttercream frosting and sprinkles and it was absolutely delish. Thanks for helping me to look like I know how to bake :)

Best cake recipe. Ever. My friend said it was the best cake she's ever had.. and she used to bake a lot.. and she's old so you know that's legit. I was kind of worried that it would be too dry because I overcooked it (my oven is very finicky). But I guess a day later she would have never noticed. Thank you Denise for an awesome recipe!

I've been making this recipe for years.  One thing to boost how quickly it will go is to add mint chocolate.  I chop up half a box of andes mint chocolate to add to the mix, and the other half I chop and use for topping.  Gone everytime!

OMG!!!! This recipe is sooooo(yes five o's) good. I made cupcakes for a baby shower and they got rave reviews. So moist and the taste was amazing!! People thought they were made from scratch. If you love chocolate cake you have to try this. This is the only recipe I will use from now on.

This is, by far, the best chocolate cake EVER.  After mine is cooled...I make a chocolate glaze with melted chocolate chips, butter and corn syrup...pour over top and then "fill the middle" (after using my pampered chef bundt pan) and I call it chocolate puddle cake.  It's sinful and delish and worth every calorie!

Grab a cold glass of milk (or hot black coffee) and enjoy a slice of this cake. I served it slightly warm and it is so delicious and the chips still gooey. I did not change the cake recipe itself, but did serve a slice with separate icing. If you're in the mood for a cake so chocolatey it hurts your teeth, try this recipe.

Based on previous reviews, I thought this cake was going to be a magical revelation for my taste buds, but it was not. This is a very good chocolate cake but I have had better. I will keep this recipe and make it again however next time I will add vanilla (I'm actually surprised the recipe didn't call for it). I made this is an medium sized football shaped cake pan and it needed to bake on the lowest shelf for about an hour and a half. If you're looking for an outrageously easy cake to make that's chocolatey and moist, this is for you!

This cake is the BOMB!!  I covered this cake in homemade peanut butter frosting and it was a HUGE hit at our party.  I am bringing it to a superbowl party tonight and a casino party next weekend.   I make the peanut butter frosting with a stick of margarine, stick of butter (both at room temperature) about a cup of peanut butter, powdered sugar and a few tablespoons of milk.  Blend until you get the desired consistency. I like it fluffy.

I made this for my husband to take to work and another for my work. I used a bag of nestle mint chocolate chips in place of the semi sweet. It turned out fantastic. I also made a lemon one using yellow cake mix instead of choc and used lemon pudding in place of chocolate. Then melted some cream cheese and mixed in confectioner's sugar to make a glaze to drizzle over the top. OMG! It went over better than the mint chocolate. All though both went quick. Thanks for a great recipe and base for other flavors. It's definitely a keeper.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 starts.  Delicious!  My husband doesn't really like cakes, but he absolutely devoured this one! The only change I made was put in half of the oil, and then added some vinegar to milk, turning it into "buttermilk" for about 5 minutes before adding it to the batter. This cake was so moist and so flavorful.  I can't say enough about it!!

This cake was good but not great. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk, also only 1 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips. It was very moist but lacked in flavor and density...maybe because of the boxed cake mix & pudding?? I actually liked the Crazy Cake recipe from this site better than this one.

I made this cake to raving reviews by my family.  I didn't even ice it; we ate it with cool whip on top.  I substituted a Butter Pecan cake mix and Butterscotch pudding mix for the chocolate and, or course, no chocolate chips.  It is delicious.  I love the texture; it is rich and dense.  Yummmmm!!!!

OMG this is the best chocolate cake. I baked it for about 1 hr and 15 minutes at 335 degree the extra time was necessary as I used a 9" bundt cake pan instead of the 10" one that the recipe calls for. I also used mini chocolate chips but other than that I made the recipe exactly as written. It was awesome I glazed it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this same site.

Amazing flavor and texture and so easy to make. I substituted half of the chocolate chips for white chocolate chips and glazed with the satiny glaze the other users recommended. Made for dad's birthday and was a huge hit!  Thank you.

I could not tell when it was done. The top was crusty after baking for 55 minutes, but the toothpick came out w/ batter all over it.   After cooling for the time specified, it collapsed in the pan before I even inverted it.  I followed the directions.  It was too well done.  ??

This really is an outstanding cake.  I got raves from everyone.  I agree, do use the mini chocolate chips, it makes a big difference. I used the  Ganache I from this site to drizzle on the cake.  Perfect, my new "go to" chocolate cake.

Wonderful!! I have a family member who can't have a lot of sugar.  This recipe is easily made with low sugar.  Substitute sugar-free chocolate chips, sugar-free pudding, and reduced sugar cake mix and it still tastes great!

Oh my god, I made this cake tonight using a fudge marble cake with Butterscotch pudding and 1 cup Butterscotch chips and 1 cup Chocolate chips. I was scared when the cake started to cool and the edges felt a little hard not to mention the fact that the cake felt like a 10 lb cake but it was super dense and moist too. I will certainly make this cake again and try several different variations!

Excellent! Made as a birthday cake in a 9 x 13 pan, left chocolate chips out since I was frosting it. I was afraid of how it would come out because the consistency of the batter was so thick, but it turned out to be a more dense, moist cake than a cake mix alone- which was a hit! Many compliments at the party!! I WILL be saving this one and making it again (and again). THANKS for posting it!!!!

This cake was out of this world!  I didnt make any changes.  DELICIOUS!  It was gobbled up fast.  Both sisters got the recipe before they left.  Oh, I did microwave choc frosting and drizzled it on top.  This will be made many times!!

This has been a family favorite for over 30 years with a little difference: 1 yellow cake mix 1 small choc fudge instant pudding 3/4 c water 3/4 c oil 3 eggs 1 c sour cream 2 c choc chips Mix all but chips, then stir in chips.  Spray bundt pan, sprinkle with sugar not flour.  No icing needed and better the next day.  Freezes will also.  Enjoy!

one of the best chocolate cakes i've had! so easy to make, and it turned out perfect. i used a little less than 1 cup of oil, light sour cream and about 1 cup of the mini chocolate chips instead. this is definitely something i will make often!

I really had a hard time getting the middle done. I had to make it three times before I got it right. The third time I used less oil as others suggested and it cooked more evenly. It also dripped through the middle and made a mess. Put something down to catch the mess. Once I got it right it was very good.

Made this for a birthday and smothered it with chocolate ganache.. I took home the plate, and everyone else took home the recipe. Very sweet, very chocolatey, and it has an almost made-from-scratch taste. Yum! ^_^

A+++  I took this cake to a New Years Eve party and it was a big hit.  I did not glaze or frost, just dusted with powdered sugar.  Also, I think it was even better the next day!!!

This did come out very moist. I think a chocolate glaze would have been good. I would try this again with a slightly sweeter topping. I served it with vanilla ice cream. Warmed this would probably be amazing.

All I have to say is WOW!  Extremely easy to make and absolutely delicious!  It's pretty rich, super moist and oh so delicious!  I made it for Christmas and sprinkled the cake powdered sugar.  This is the no-fail chocolate cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and added about 8 additional minutes to cooking.  Turned out perfect!  Will definitely serve this again and again!

I followed the directs almost exactly, except I used a bit less chocolate chips and I used minis. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and milk instead of water. This cake to me does need frosting. Also it took me more like 1 hr and 20 minutes to bake. Possibly because I had the cake on the bottom rack.

I made this for thanksgiving. The cake was super easy to make and was really rich and tasted great. very moist and chocolatey. I made it in a bundt pan and drizzled with chocolate ganache, white chocolate and then sprinkled white chocolate bits on top. I put sliced and chocolate covered strawberries in the middle and it was a really pretty cake!

WOW!  If you like chocolate, you will love this cake.  Be prepared to make copies of this recipe for all of your friends.  I usually add a chocolate chip glaze.

I was looking for a dessert to bring to party and this one looked too good to be true. I stayed true to the recipe....although I made it lighter. I used egg beaters in place of the eggs, light sour cream and in place of the oil I used sun sweet lighter bake. I did add 2 tablespoons of oil for a little fat.  I used mini chips as suggested by others, just not quite as much. In the end it came out rich, moist and when I sprinkled powdered sugar on it ....gorgeous! I can't imagine how rich it is with the full fat ingredients. It certainly wasn't diet food how I made it...but no one missed the fat!  Great recipe....tonight I am making cupcakes for my son's class using the same recipe and am hoping it works out well!

There can never be too much chocolate and this cake proves the point.  Add chocolate to chocolate and mix with chocolate and what do you get? - An awesome cake that you don't want to share :-)  Thank you for sharing :-)

I prepared this recipe exactly as written. I found it a quite chocolaty and a bit heavier than other cakes. My chocolate chips sank to the bottom of the bunt pan while baking so I had a thick layer of melted chocolate on the top of the cake.

This cake is very easy to prepare, and so rich! I did make some changes to the original recipe; I used 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, and added two  packages of chocolate instant pudding. The cake will puff up quite a bit while baking, due to the extra pudding, but will return to normal size once it is out of the oven. I baked this for 60 minutes at 350F. I also used a full package (approx. 2 cups) of semi-sweet chocolate chunks instead of the morsels. I have also made this cake in a 13x9-inch baking dish--330F for about 45-50 minutes. The result was the softest, moistest, most flavorful chocolate Bundt cake I have ever made. It does not need icing; a dusting of powdered sugar is enough. Everyone in my family thought this was delicious!

I made the recipe exactly as stated. The inside of the cake was great and moist and deliciously chocolatey, but the outside was oddly crispy - kind of like the edges of an overdone brownie. If I ever make this recipe again, I'll be sure to do it with the modifications suggested by some of the reviewers - reduce oil, add milk etc.

Excellent! Very moist, extremely chocolatey, and perfect with a tall glass of milk and some ice cream. I agree that mini chocolate chips are the best. I also like to garnish with fresh raspberries or strawberries. Yum!

Thank you, thank you! This cake was a nice addition to our Thanksgiving feast.  I will be using this recipe from now on.  Oh I did also like one of the other reviewers us 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1 cup.  Also, I melted some Duncan Hines double chocolate Fudge frosting and drizzled it on top!  Can you tell I love chocolate.

Absolutely wonderful! I have made this cake twice to date-once for a church function and once again today for a family Thanksgiving celebration-with superb results each time. I didn't quite like the idea of using all these ready made ingredients so I altered things a bit to make it my own. I omitted the sour cream and pudding mix, choosing to make a homemade chocolate pudding(1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup white sugar, 3 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 cup half&half, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup milk; made in the microwave. 3 minutes initially then in 1 minute intervals, stirring for 2 to 4 minutes between cycles) instead. I also reduced the vegetable oil to 3/4 cup. The chocolate chips were a mixture of milk and white because I wanted a sweeter flavor and greater richness (semisweet don't melt as well as the other chips). Divine when paired with a white chocolate glaze (Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site using white chips instead of semisweet). I grated some white chocolate as well as placing whole chips on top of the cake. The contrast is beautiful! This cake will be a star among all events I attend requiring dessert. Thanks so much!

Good recipe, especially if you are in a super hurry to get this in the oven, it whips up in no time. I used an organic basic chocolate food cake mix.   I only had a non-instant vanilla pudding mix, so I used that. It thickened up nicely while cooking.   I didn't have sour cream so I used mayonnaise (1 cup) - yummy!  I reduced the 4 eggs to 3 because of the mayo, 2/3 cup of oil, also because of the mayo. Ran my knife over the chocolate chips a few times so they would melt into the batter nicely while it cooked. They did. I started with a batter I thought was a touch runny, but I went ahead and cooked it anyway in a 9 x 13 glass pan for nearly an hour at as close to 350? as I can get my old oven to heat up to. It set up better than I had expected. I let it cool in the pan, then I decorated with my standard chocolate frosting: Whip together 3C Icing Sugar, 3Tbsp good quality Cocoa powder, 3Tbsp Butter, a generous Tbsp of Vanilla, 3-4 Tbsp slowly added Heavy cream. I'm sure you can use any combination of cake & pudding mixes, or eve trade the chocolate chips in for white chocolate, butterscotch, or even peanut butter chocolate chips, and still come out with an easy hit and crowd favorite. I'm using this recipe next for a spice cake made with vanilla pudding mix & white chocolate chips, covered in icing made with baileys instead of milk.  ;)

This cake was amazingly delicious!  I somehow missed the "stirring in the chocolate chips part of the recipe and instead used the chips mixed with cream to make a delicious ganache.  Filled the center with raspberries...perfection!  I make cakes for a living and this will be a keeper!

Easy to make great cake! Made it for my husband's birthday as he is a chocolate lover.  I am not... I expected it to be much more rich, although I ate a really small piece.  He loved it so that is all that matters :) I followed the recipe to a T except used chocolate fudge pudding.  I served strawberries and whipped cream on the side and that was a good balance.  I think next time I will try this as a layered cake with a fruit or icing layer in between.  I would definitely make this again and would recommend it!

I made this exactly how the recipe said to. I used two 9 inch round pans and cooked for 40 minutes and they turned out perfect. Everyone loved it. They said it tasted like a brownie cake. I wasn't expecting the batter to be so thick I couldn't use an electric mixer but it turned out excellent!

My Grandmother has been making this for me for 35 years.  Was always a treat when I visited her. I don't do the warm water and I add extra chips (can't have too many.)  It's also better when it's been sitting for a day...if you can wait. I want to add I think is an important note as I couldn't figure out why my cake had been dry a couple of times...you need to use Duncan Hines.  I had used what was on sale, there is a big difference.

This cake is perfect! I made it for my chocolate loving husband's birthday and he was so surprised by the chocolate chips. I followed another review and made my cake in 2 nine inch round pans. I cut each cake in half and filled with raspberry filling between each layer. I then poured warm gnache on top and let it drip down the sides. The best cake I have ever tasted!!

This is amazing!!!!!  Turns out great every time I make it.  My only changes are that I use coffee instead of water and I make cupcakes.  Just bake for 19 - 22 min.....  I get rave reviews every time!!!!

Absolutely love it.  Went by the recipe, except used butter instead of oil & melted chocolate & cocoa powder instead of the chocolate chips.  It had a beautiful color & texture, especially the "crunchy" layer created on the bottom.  This is definitely my new favorite chocolate cake recipe.  Loved it.

I used 1/2 c oil and 1/3 c milk (thanks to other recommendations). I also used the smaller regular size of pudding. Fabulous. Drizzled with melted chocolate chips w/ a little heavy whipping cream or milk added to make it the right thinness. Quick and very good.

This cake is amazing, I also took others suggestion and did not use as much oil (turned out great), also used fat free sour cream and milk chocolate chips.. I have made this cake several times coupled with the buttercream icing recipe (also on all recipes) Yummy!

I've used this recipe many times, all fail proof. Last night, I realised that I only had 2 eggs and didn't have any sour cream. I used 3/4 cup milk with 3/4 tablespoon of vinegar and 1/3 cup of butter (approx. 75 grams) to replace the sour cream (or you could use 3/4 butter milk and 1/3 cup of butter). I also only made do with two eggs, and the cake turned out superbly! It's not has dense as the original recipe, but the taste wasn't compromised!

For a "cheater" cake, this is easy and good.  I call them "cheater" cakes because they're not really made from scratch but serves its purposes and tastes good.

Made this cake for a friend's birthday. He said it was the best chocolate cake he has ever had and, to be honest, I completely agree!  While it IS rich, it isn't overwhelming. I made the recipe as stated, using mini chocolate chips and split the batter into two pans.  After baking and cooling, I sprinkled one with powdered sugar and the other was covered with a chocolate glaze. I can't choose my favorite because they are both SCRUMPTIOUS!  Major bonus points for being super easy.

I made this for a get-together I was having at my house.  I used applesauce (I didn't have any veg. oil) and I also used the mini chocolate chips, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on top and it was delicious and received rave reviews.  I recommend having a tall glass of milk with it.  YUMMM!  I think I will make again soon!

Made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe except did what some others did and subsitute the oil for applesauce. This was also the first time I made a bundt cake so wasn't sure how it would come out. I also use one bag of regular sized chocolate chips and a 1/2 bag of mini chips. Used the rest to sprinkle on top of the cake. The cake batter was really thick, like brownie batter. I had to bake it for about 1 hour. I cheated and used store bought white chocolate glaze and went overboard on it. The cake was like a cross of a dense chocolate cake or a lighter brownie. I was joking with my dh and said that I could make the white version (white cake, vanilla pudding, and white chocolate chips) and he dared me since he loved this cake so much. I think I'll stick with the chocolate version. You know what they say about women and their chocolate...

Absolutely delicious!!  I made this for a dinner party and the men all got seconds.  I only added half of the chocolate chips, after reading other reviews.  I wish I would have added the other half.  I heart chocolate!  I will absolutely make this again!!

Fantastic as it is.  I did make mine in a 9x13 pan and it was amazing.  My daughter said that it was the best cake I've made in a long time.  I did frost it with a cream cheese/cool whip frosting.  AMAZING together!  Thanks so much for the easy recipe.

This is probably the best cake I've ever made! I've always made it exactly the way the recipe says and never had any problems, but I can tell it would be very flexible. I think I'll use caramel pudding next time.

This is THE cake to make!! I made a couple changes because of what I had on hand. I only used a small box of instant chocolate pudding and only 1 cup of  choc chips. I decreased the oil to 2/3 cup and used lowfat sour cream. I used chocolate glaze I from this site and sprinked with heath bar bits. WOW! I took it to work and it was quickly gone with lots of compliments! This cake recipe is very versatile and tastes awesome! Will be making this for years to come!!

What an awesome recipe!!! I have made this cake several times, and everyone loves it. My only complaint is that I can't stay out of it. So I changed the recipe up a little by using sugar/fat free ingredients. I made it again today and topped it with strawberries. You can't go wrong no matter how you make it.

Easy to make. The cake came out perfect, it didn't have this big lump in the middle, like most of my cakes do. The cake was MOIST & DELICIOUS! Topped with satiny chocolate glaze, it was perfect.

I didnt have sour cream so I substituted 7/8 cup buttermilk and 3 T butter that i blended in a small food processor. I also used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of half the oil and strong coffee in place of the water. I used a 3.9 oz package of chocolate pudding and 1 cup of peanutbutter and white chips. Topped with powdered sugar and MmMmMm was this GOOD!! My fiance loved it!

This is an awesome chocolate cake recipe.  A couple of changes...I used mini chocolate chips like many recommended and it turned out perfect!  I also used a regular chocolate cake mix and baked in 2 rounds.  I drizzled starbucks carmel in between the layers of cake and frosted the cake.  YUMMY!!  I will for sure make this again.

Oh my goodness, this is such a great recipe!  I made cupcakes with a mini Reese's Peanut Butter Cup inside, then added peanut butter frosting from this site and topped with crumbled peanut butter cups.  Got RAVE reviews!

Denise,  just wanted to let you know that this is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it in a bundt pan and in cupcakes.  The only thing that I changed was that I used mini semisweet chocolate chips.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Great everytime!

THIS IS DELICOUS! I'd definitely recommend getting  a chocolate glaze for the outside so it doesn't look so plain. However- This was the best cake I've ever made. I can't wait to have another

This recipe is great! I will use it when ever I want to make a chocolate cake from now on. The only change I made was 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 2. For me, I think 1 cup was more than enough. There was no bite that didn't have a couple chips. I made it with a cream cheese frosting.

A few weeks back I made this for an office potluck. I made two cake layers and topped one with chocolate satin glaze (which I purchased) and the other with whipped vanilla frosting.  All of us agreed we liked the chocolate satin glaze over the whipped vanilla frosting. The glaze really brings out the other chocolate layered flavors of the cake.  Overall, the cake with glaze topping was a huge hit, but not the cake topped with frosting. And no one asked for the recipe and the frosting topped cake was not really touched. Chocolate glaze prep is a keeper.  I did use milk instead of water. Next time, I will melt the chips a bit, then add the melted chips to the batter. I think I would prefer the evenness of the chocolate throughout the cake, instead of bits of chocolate.

Incredible: As per other reviews, I only used 1/2 cup oil, 1 1/2 cup choc chips & 1/3 cup milk.  I actually baked in 2x9" rounds alternating top/bottom shelf for about 50 min...cake was perfect.  I always bake top/bottom shelf alternating..seems to turn out cakes/cupcakes perfectly every time with less cooking time.  I used Satiny Chocolate Glaze on top, and filled the layers with Magnolia Bakery Vanilla Buttercream frosting and sprinkled crushed semi-sweet choc chips on top.  BEST CAKE OVERALL - Simply Incredible!

Yummy! I fixed cupcakes with this recipe for a get together and haven't even frosted them yet and the cake itself is just delicious and really not a lot of work either - so much better than just a box mix by itself!! Yum! Will definitely use again and can't wait to serve these to some hungry Marines tomorrow! :) They made 30 cupcakes for me and I baked for 20 minutes at the recommended temp. I used mini chocolate chips.

Wow!!! I made this cake for my birthday and we all loved it. It's very moist with an intense rich chocolate taste. This cake is so good, you don't even need to put icing on it. Yummy and decadent. I followed the recipe exactly, with no changes, and it came out perfect. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I was very disappointed when I tried this after following the recipe exactly. I made it yesterday for my boyfriend's birthday cake. He wanted a super chocolaty cake without frosting. I thought this would be perfect. If you are looking for something that tastes like a box then this is it, but I was looking for something a little more sophisticated. Even my boyfriend said it was just So-So... I will not make this again.

I LOVE this recipe- I made cupcakes instead of a bundt cake. After the cupcakes cooled I filled the middle with pudding mixture: 1 package cheesecake instant pudding, 1 cup milk & 1 tub thawed cool whip. Place mixture in piping bag and allow to set in the frige then fill the center of the cupcake- SO Yummy!! To die for!

Ok, new record for my family...entire cake gone in 2 days! This is the most moist, chocolate satisfying cake I've ever had. Definitely have to leave in the pan to cool for the hour and half, otherwise it would probably fall apart. Tried it with half applesauce/half oil, and light sour cream. You would NEVER know it. Also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze on it, Supreme!!!!!

I work in a bakery and agree that this cake is definately the best! My family and I made 300 small loaves wrapped them up and froze them for a week to feed the homeless later that week. It didnt alter the taste, they were still wonderful. We eat them at the house, I dont even ice them they are so moist. Sometimes we put powdered sugar over them :)

WOW!!!! Amazing cake! This recipe is quick, easy and delicious! I did make a few minor modifications: only used 1/2 c oil, used coffee instead of water, used chocolate fudge cake mix and used mini chocolate chips. Baked for 52 minutes and the cake came out moist and delicious! Topped it with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" and it looked like a professionally-made cake!

This is definitely one of the best "altered" cake mix recipes I've ever tried. You can follow the directions exactly or customize flavors to your own liking and it still works out perfectly!  My favorite would have to be adding peanut butter chips and chocolate pudding to a funfetti mix. It's like Reese's heaven.  This simple recipe is brilliant.

This is such a great recipe. Thanks to another review, I've tried this with vanilla cake and white chocolate pudding mix, as well as other flavours. The vanilla and white chocolate pudding is awesome, I just learned not to use white chocolate chips. I've now made this at least a dozen times for birthday cakes in various shaped bundt pans. I've done several versions of this with the white mix, white pudding and divvied the dough into multiple bowls, tinted each one a bright colour with paste food colouring, then spooned the batter into the pan to make rainbow cakes. This makes an awesome cake for any shaped pan.

Amazing cake!!  This is a hit every time I make it.   I did make a change based on other reviews.  Only used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil.  I use two 9" cake pans.  I fill the layers with raspberry preserves, top with chocolate buttercream frosting, and sprinkle the top with mini chocolate chips.  At my last dinner party, my guests thought the cake came from a bakery.

Amazing!!!! I used the Chocolate Glaze recipe for a topping and this cake disappeared quick! Serve warm with vanilla ice cream and you can't go wrong.

Wow! This recipe is amazing! I made cupcakes for my husbands bday and everybody loved them. The only thing I did different was I used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of half of the oil. I also added some milk because the batter was pretty thick and I was nervous about it. I didn't know what the constincency was supposed to be like but it didn't hurt them.  FYI: I ended up being able to make 34 cupcakes with this recipe and they baked perfectly at 19 minutes. They didn't dome up, they actually sunk a little bit in the middles, which was ok bc I was topping with ganache so I didn't want a dome shape anyways.

My family loved this cake!  I followed the ingredient list exactly and it turned out perfect.  I baked the cake in 2 9inch pans and turned the temp down to about 275 the last 20 minutes.  The cake was very moist, but still easy to frost and stack.  I used a homemade cream cheese icing and it was to die for!  I will turn to this easy and quick to put together cake many times in the future!

Made this for my mom's birthday using sugar-free pudding mix, fat-free sour cream, applesauce instead of oil and 1 egg with 4 egg whites and only 1.5 cups of mini chocolate chips.  Everyone raved and even I liked it and I'm not a chocolate cake fan.  I baked 50 minutes in the bundt pan and it set perfect.  Used chocolate satiny glaze recipe from this site to frost and sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top.  Truly a keeper for me!

Excellent cake!  Using the cake mix as a base saves a lot of time but still has that homemade quality  I have make this cake 3 times this month!  I baked it in 3 9in pans and frosted with a traditional chocolate frosting.  Unlike another reviewer I had no problems getting it out of the pan.  I greased and floured the pan before baking.  My teenage son who can usually eat 1/2 of a cake could only eat 1 slice because it is so rich.  Served it at a birthday party and everyone raved about the cake and even requested the recipe.

I made this last week for a co-worker's birthday and everyone was fighting over the last piece! It was so moist and delicious. I followed the instructions exacly, but needed to reduce the baking time to 45 minutes. I topped the cake with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (from this site), chopped walnuts, and more chocolate chips.  I'm making another one tonight! Thank you for the recipe!

Decadent and delicious.  I used sugar-free chocolate pudding and fat-free sour cream.  I cut the oil back to 1/2 cup and added 1/3 cup fat-free milk.

I made this for my 2year anni with my boyfriend, and he ABSOULETLY LOVED IT. Super moist and chocolatey.  I followed the recommendations from others (french vanilla coffee instead of water, 1/2c of veg oil, and 1/3 cup of milk). chocolate heaven... thanks for the recipe!!!

Loved this cake, so moist and delicious. I only used about a cup of mini-chocolate chips instead of 2 cups regular chips and it was just enough.  The second time I made this, I used a yellow cake mix instead of devil's food and the flavor was even better!

This is incredible! If you're not really crazy about chocolate, then this cake isn't for you. It's VERY rich and the name of this cake describes it very well. I personally can't get enough chocolate, so I loved it. followed the recipe exactly, and would definitely make it again.

If I could give this more than 5 starts, I would. I made this recipe exactly as instructions are written and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone couldn't wait to try it. I added a double recipe of Chocolaty Satin Glaze (from this site) on top. Wow!! The next time I make it, I may add some Kahlua to the glaze...  I will definitely be making this again. THANKS for sharing the recipe!

I found this recipe about 2 months ago and I am making it for the third time already (and we don't generally make many cakes).  I'm pregnant and wanted a gooooood chocolate cake.  Well, this did it for me! Totally satisfied my craving - and that says a lot!  Didn't alter in any way.  Perfect.  Goes good with fresh strawberries.  The mini chocolate chips were a good suggestion.  Enjoy this recipe!!!

Amazing! I made cupcakes with half brooke's bombshell brownies and half cake recipe. I topped it with an oreo filling recipe I found and crumbled oreos. Also great with peanutbutter frosting. There are never leftovers when I take them to parties. I gave some to my sister in law for a bakesale she was having but they never made it because she ate them all.

It is no surprise this cake was delicious. There are thousands of reviews that say just that. I have made cakes from scratch and cakes from a box and this is the best of both. Not nearly as labor intensive asa from scratch cake, since you are using a cake mix, but absolutely moist and perfect. The first time I made this cake, I overcooked it a bit and it was a little dry. I kept sticking a toothpick in to check for doneness and I must have been hitting the melted chocolate chips. The second time I made it I kept with the suggested time. Do as others have suggested and use the mini chocolate chips. This will stay in the recipe box for birthdays and other special events.

Delicious! I followed other reviews and used applesauce instead of oil, egg whites only, and mini chocolate chips. There were so many suggestions about cooking times and temps that I kept messing with the oven and the cooking time took forever, but it was all worth it in the end. Best chocolate cake I've ever made or had!

There are so many reviews of this recipe, I don't know if another one will make a difference.  I have made this several times now, and it is unbelievable!  It is extremely chocolaty.  People ALWAYS love it, many saying it is the best chocolate cake they have ever had.  It is soo moist!  I am a big believer in making things from scratch, but when you have a special occasion and are short on time, this can't be beat.  You really don't know it's from the box.  It's so easy, I feel guilty accepting the (numerous) compliments whenever I make it.  I used 1/2 C. oil and 1/2 C. milk for a less oily consistency, and yogurt instead of the sour cream (not trying to be healthier but sour cream was unavailable).  The cake doesn't really need a frosting, but this last time I topped it with chocolate ganache, and that added something.  Baked it in a 10x14(approx?) dish for 32 mins.  Works well with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  It is almost truly "too much chocolate cake"! :)

Do not change a thing. This is THE BEST CHOCOLATE you will ever make!!!!! Definitely use the satiny chocolate glaze with it. So moist and stays fresh for days, even though it won't last long!

Absolutely decadently scrumptious. Best chocolate cake I've made by a wide margin. Drenched with Satiny Choc Glaze from the site, and added chopped pecans and sprinkle of powdered sugar. Served with vanilla ice cream.

OMG! I made this cake for a cakewalk, but wanted to try it out first. This is the most sinful piece of heaven I have ever tasted!!!! I used mini chocolate chips and apple sauce in place of the oil, and light sour cream (hey I had to make it as healthy as possible!!! lol) and it was still spectacular! Definitely will make this again!!!

First off, I am not a chocolate lover (hard to believe, I know), but my husband is and yesterday was his birthday. I decided to make this cake because of the name. I figured if he wants chocolate, he's going to get chocolate, by gum! I followed the recipe exactly and frosted it with a cream cheese, sour cream frosting. My husband said it was the best cake he ever had.  And I, who can take or leave cake in general and chocolate in particular ate two pieces! The only thing I don't like about this cake and the frosting I made is that a piece probably contains about 50,000 calories give or take a couple thousand. Sure can't make it very often.

I made this for a bake sale recently.  The recipient told me later that it was "amazing" and asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again since everyone in my family was drooling over it and wanted me to leave it at home and send something else for the bake sale!

FANTASTIC!!  I recommend to NOT refridgerate this cake.  It would've been fine the day of, rather than waiting a day.  Still, a big hit--Covered with chocolate covered strawberries and the chocolate satiny glaze from this site.  ALMOST too much chocolate...ALMOST.  ;D

This was good!  The first time I made it as a 9x13 sheet cake and did not frost it, just a little powdered sugar on the top.  I made cupcakes the second time and topped with "One Bowl Buttercream Frosting" from this website and everyone loved them.  I got a special request for them after that so this one is definitely a keeper!

This cake was gone in less than 2 days!  I used mini chocolate chip because that was what I had.  I did have to cook mine about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe suggested.  I just kept checking it in 5 minute intervals until the knife came out clean.  Next time I'll probably add chopped pecans or maybe use peanut butter chips.  This is good!

I read some reviews and I see people were asking if they can be done as cupcakes. Yes they can! I made them for my friend's 22nd birthday party and I topped it with vanilla buttercream frosting. The visual effect was stunning because the cupcakes looked white and silver (I used aluminum foil cupcake liners). everyone loved them and I got tons of compliments.  this cake rises a lot (at least as a cupcake). Use one tablespoon full of batter for each cupcake. I also took other reviewer's suggestions and used 3/4 cup of oil.  It's a keeper!

This was soooooooo good!!! I loved chocolate and this cake was perfect and very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly but it needed more than 55 min. to bake. I will try this recipe again adding the satiny chocolate glaze like so many suggested… never can have to much chocolate!!! Right! Thank you Denise for sharing this awesome recipe.

Very, very good. Made to recipe.  Comments from recipients were "This may be the best chocolate cake I've ever had," "Fantastic" and "Amazing."  It was a huge hit for my dad's birthday party.  Used the regular sized chips and they were good, may try the small chips.  Seriously, make this today even if you are hesitant about using a cake mix like I was.

THIS IS THE BEST CAKE!!! I take this cake with me every time im asked to bring a dessert! I like to make them into cup cakes as well! When I do cup cakes I skip the chocolate chips and add a "surprise" into each cup, weather it be a rolo or a herseys kiss ( also fun because you can choose a flavor) people really like that! Thanks for my go to, impress anyone, super easy cake!

Oh. My. Deliciousness. I've made this recipe 3x in the last month - I'm obsessed! And anyone who tastes this cake is too. The cake is super moist & doesn't need frosting (just a light dusting of powdered sugar).  The only thing I would change would be to use MINI chocolate chips. They melt & incorporate better, which makes for easier slicing.  Try mixing it up by using mint chips or cherry chips. Or make a new flavor by using yellow cake mix + butterscotch pudding + butterscotch chips... the possibilities are endless! And delicious!!

Let me just preface this by saying I don't like chocolate cake. I needed something to make for company last night and chose this based on the 5 star rating and over 2,000 reviews. Well- turns out I LOOOVVVEEEEE chocolate cake! This was the most delicious, MOIST cake ever. My guests were 'Oooing and Awwing' at every bite! I followed directions/ingredients exactly and will be making this cake again and again!! MMmmm! 100 Stars!

Deadly chocolate....they all scarfed it up. I added a dark chocolate ganache because, well, enough is never enough. Will make again for sure.

I agree with the others.  This is a "to die for" chocolate cake.  Paired up with my Grandma's Special Have Faith Icing, it is perfect!

Excellent - I did make one change that didn't work out.  I didn't have chocolate or peanut butter chips, but I did have little peanut butter cups.  I chopped them and added them to the batter but they sunk to the bottom and when getting the cake out of the bundt pan, some of the top stuck (my own fault).  But the flavor and consistency of the cake was wonderful.  A big hit!  I'll definitely make this one again.

Fantastic recipe! I live at a very high altitude (7000 ft) and was worried about how it would turn out, but it was great. I cooked it in two 9 inch pans at 350 for 40 minutes. Perfection!

Just had this cake over a friends house. My goodness WOW, it was great. Can't wait to make it and try some of the other ideas with peanut butter chips with chocolate and cherry chip cake with vanilla pudding.  Thanks for the recipe..

This cake is amazingly rich. It is so moist and delicious. I actually ice it with a coffee/chocolate icing; it is to die for! You will not be disappointed. Definitely not for a calorie counter though!

Heavy cake, but so good. I dusted the cake w/powder sugar, as recommended, & that was enough. I do think next time I make this, I'll mix everything but the pudding & then mix in the pudding just before the choc chips so it doesn't get so stiff right away. Might also try mint choc chips for a change. This is good no matter what you do.

A chocolate lovers dream! Very good even though I had to use a brownie mix (for a 9x13 pan) I gave my store list to my BF and he picked up browie mix by accident. I really did not think it would make a differance but it did not rise as high as it should have BUT it is VERY good anyway! Sort of gooey in the center as a brownie would be. We all loved it! I will try it again with a cake mix.

Ridiculous! Chocolatey and moist -- but not so rich that you can't eat two slices in a row. ;)  Sold at a work fundraiser and got lots of complements.

I'm not a big chocolate fan, but I'm newly converted to this one. Wow! Baked this cake in 3 6 inch pans but only used 2 layers of it because they were so fluffy and beautiful it only needed 2 (I'm eating the 3rd layer all by myself - great warmed up in the microwave for 10-15 seconds!! Yummy) using reviewers tips on 3/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup milk. Covered in crusted cream cheese buttercream then covering in fondant for a two tiered birthday cake! The bottom tier being banana nut cake. Turned out great. I added a pic.

I wanted a chocolate cake for my buddy's birthday.  He's a real chocolaholic.  This one was perfect!  I made it exactly as printed except I used another reviewers idea and used mini chips.  They were evenly distributed through out the entire cake instead of ending up at the bottom like bigger chips can do.  I used another persons icing made of 3 cups of coolwhip melted in the nuker with 8oz. of semi sweet bakers chocolate.  It made a nice semi hard coating on the inside of the bundt cake which I filled with sliced strawberries.  I used another recipe's idea and made a large flower on top of the cake with strawberry slices.  It was a big hit, and he took a picture to send to his mom.

This cake is delicious... it is moist and very chocolatey!  I used peanut butter chips instead of the chocolate chips and it added another dimension to this desert.  Also served it with ice cream and hot fudge sauce recipe (also on this site).  Got great reviews from all my guests.

For an over-the-top chocolate cake, I would prefer a cake with fine texture.  This is more a dump cake that tastes like a lot of chocolate. I froze part of the cake, and after it came out, it gets more stars in my book.  It was more moist and passable.

Very good for a quick cake.  I usually don't use boxed cake mix in my recipes because I prefer all ingredients from scratch.  But I made this cake very quickly on a week night and happened to have the cake mix in the pantry.  I didn't have any chocolate instant pudding so I used vanilla instant pudding instead and added 2 tablespoons of baking cocoa powder and a tsp of chocolate extract.  The cake is very moist and yummy.

This was GREAT! My mom who isn't a cake person was visiting when I made this and had a slice every day until it was gone! I swear the cake got moister as the days went on. Delicious warmed up and served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream! Will be saving this one for future use!

OMG! Rich, so Rich and so good. I made it exactly as the recipe says. I made to small round ones and followed the advise of a previous reviewer on the time and temperature, 330 degrees for 45 minutes. Because I use my convection oven, the convection temperature is 305 degrees.  It was perfect. My husband and I had a slice and then called the neighbors to come pick it up. Thank You for the great recipe.

This cake has stolen my heart! I crave it and I'm not in love with food on a whole. I suggest using the tiny chocolate chips as they become suspended in the batter and melt during the baking. Every bit has yummy goodness delightfully hidden inside.

This cake is fan-fan-fantastic! I really loved it and so did my family. I used a ganache recipe for the covering. Has anyone tried to make cupcakes out of the batter? If so, can you let me know what you did or how you changed it, if at all? Thanks!

I'm a guy who doesn't cook/bake a whole lot (unless it involves the grill)....   I made this for my wife last night.   It was extremely easy to make and was by far the BEST chocolate cake I have ever had.   And she agreed!

I make this cake at every function and never do I not get comments as to the moistness and flavor of this dessert. I also make a homemade chocolate icing that I put on it. {but it doesnt need it, at all! My mom said she prefers it without the icing!} Great recipe!!

Made exactly as described.  Excellent cake, moist, rich, delicious. Icing or glaze would ruin the balance, leave plain or with a light dusting of powdered sugar. I have a heavy bundt pan, and an accurate oven. 350 for 1 hour was exactly right.

This does not need any more rave reviews but I have to give it one more. I took this to the office today for my birthday treat and they loved it. I added a few more calories to this by drizzling it with a little caramel frosting from this site and then decorating it with whole pecans. It was gorgeous and loved by all. They also love whipped cream so I had that on the side which they all took. These addition just took a fantastic chocolate cake over the top. They can't wait for my birthday again next year.

This was a really moist easy cake! My only regret was that I ommitted the chocolate chips. I think it would have been great with the mini choco chips. I also think some icing or chocolate sauce would have been a good addition. I would definetly make this again!

This has become my "go-to" chocolate cake recipe.  The only change I have made is to use mini-morsels for the chocolate chips.  Extremely moist and keeps very well.

I've made this once before and forgot to comment. This is the BEST (and I mean best!) Chocolate cake recipe I've ever used! I don't think I'll ever try another! It is rich, but I still love it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze frosting! Mmmm. Thanks Denise!

If you want to wow your family and guest, this is thee best cake you can put out on your table.  It's super easy, and so fun to decorate it.  Love love love it!! I took the advice from another review using the tiny chocolate chips, much better I think.  But it's def. the cake you want to make!!! (That's if you totally love chocolate!!)

I made this recipe because it was a 5 star.  I only make homemade cake but tried this one.  It was only ok and won't make this again.  My 29 year old daughter really liked it.  It tasted like a box cake.

Very rich and moist!  I have also tried this with red velvet cake mix, chocolate pudding, and no chocolate chips.  It was the best red velvet cake I've ever had!!  I used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this website which is also DELICIOUS!!

soo yummy. it was exactly what i was looking for; chocolately, moist and super easy! and even though people just put a simple ganache or sprinkle icing sugar don't be afraid to ice it. i used a luscious chocolate buttercream and it complemented the cake perfectly. it wasn't a chocolate overload as many would expect mostly because it was made with a cake mix and they although they look chocolately they don't typically have that rich flavour that you get from a homemade cake. but nonetheless, incredible cake, go make it!

Very good...I actually despise anything that is box mix so I use my homemade chocolate cake recipe minus any of the wet ingredients and it comes out awesome.

Oh yum.  Dense, dark and moist.  Used mini chocolate chips and it was good, can't wait to try peanut butter chips.  It did take quite a bit longer to cook (15 min) in my oven which is usually on the fast side, especially with baking.  A big hit, will make again.

Unbelievable!  I am a chocolate cake snob, and this recipe is IT!  Serve slightly warm with vanilla ice cream....divine!!!  Every time I make this, my guests rave about it.  Best thing is, it's EASY!!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!  P.S.  My SIL made this a lemon cake by using a lemon cake, lemon pudding, and vanilla chips instead.  That too was lovely.

Looking for a cake to make for a birthday party.  This just wasn't quite right.  I'm looking for a cake-mix-cake that does not taste like it is made with a cake mix.  This wasn't it.  However, hubby loved the cake.  He said I could make it anytime.  I, like many other reviewers, used 1/2 c oil and replaced the other half with coffee.  I also used chocolate milk instead of water.  Taste was good, but I was looking for a more dense cake, like a pound cake.

Made this for about 10 people for a lunch and is was gone in no time! I really love chocolate so I drizzled ganache of the top...YUM! It was sooo cheap and easy to make. The hardest part was waiting for it to cool so I could taste it. One last thing, I live in CO at about 8,500 feet and didn't have to make a single change! AWESOME! Thanks for a fab recipe!

Made this last night for a covered dish dinner I was attending.  Being a chocoholic I was very excited about it.  I followed the recipe exactly, using mini-chocolate chips and light sour cream.  The batter was extremely thick spreading all the way up the beaters as I mixed it with my hand mixer.  I really enjoyed licking the beaters:-).  I did have to bake it about 10 extra minutes to make sure it was baked all the way through.  I sprinkled it with powder sugar.  Surprisingly, only two small slices were taken - I took the first piece to check it out.  I guess unless you don't like chocolate, this is not too much chocolate!  I probably will try it again, but, using substitutions to make it lighter version - applesauce, sugarfree pudding, egg substitute and light sour cream. This was good, but, not quite as good as my sister's chocolate, chocolate chip zucchini cake recipe.  However, my kids are very happy that I brought most of it home for them!

This turned out excellent. I made a few changes out of necessity...I used 1/2 plain yogurt for the sour cream because I ran out, I only had 3 eggs, and I didn't use any chocolate chips. It was really nice and chocolatey and I just topped it with some powdered sugar. Easy, simple, and super good :)

Honestly, I am NOT a chocolate cake fan. However, I had a request for a chocolate dessert, so I made this and drizzled with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and garnished with raspberries. Not only was it gorgeous, it was decadent! The cake is so moist! I just about melts in your mouth. I wanted 2nds and 3rds!

I'm a cake decorator and have been using this recipe for a couple of years when asked to do a chocolate chip cake. Everyone raves about it. I prefer to make cakes from scratch, but this recipe is fantastic in a pinch. Doesn't taste like a boxed cake at all. It is a dense cake and holds up well. I use 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and it turns out moist having a nice chocolaty taste. My son-in-law who hates cake requests this one from me. He calls it the Otis Spunkmeyer cake.

I made this cake for Christmas and I can honestly say that this is one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever eaten.  It has wonderful chocolate flavor, moist, lovely texture and keeps well.  Everyone loved this cake.  I would not change a thing.  I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze....to die for.  Next time tho, I will double the glaze.  It sets up nicely, not too firm, but  I think I would like to make it a little thicker on the cake.  Note that both the cake and the icing are not sickly sweet nor overly chocolatey.  Just rich and delicious.  I can see why this recipe won First Prize.  Well deserved.....Thank you for sharing Denise.

Everybody in my family loved this!!! I added a 1/4 cup of milk to the recipe because the batter was too dry (maybe my eggs were a bit on the small side) and it came out very well. I have even made this recipe in mini muffin pans baking them at the same temp for 15 minutes and they were just as awesome and you get the added benefit of portion control.

I love this cake, it is quick and easy to make! Not only does it taste wonderful it looks great too. I also use the Satiny Chocolate glaze (also on this site) to top it off. I think I might try it with a different type of cake mix, I am thinking Strawberry with vanilla pudding....hmmm....

Thanks Denise for the fabulous recipe!  Normally I don't change recipes on the first try unless I have to, but from reading the reviews I loved the idea of:  replacing water with coffee, using 1 cup mini chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup milk.  Turned out delicious, moist, and chocolaty and I got lots of compliments on it.  :)  I think it's hard to go wrong with this one ... will definitely be making it again!

This cake was just ok for me. I loved the flavor but the cake itself is just too dense. I will continue to use the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can for my chocolate fix.

It really is too much chocolate. I would consider making this for a group, but just to have around the house . . . One piece is enough to put you off chocolate for a while. And I'm not a wimp when it comes to chocolate. I didn't have enough eggs or pudding mix to make the bundt cake, so I halved the recipe and made 12 full cupcakes, no icing. I chopped (actually more like half-chopped, half-shaved) the chocolate chips with a large knife because I was concerned about them sinking to the bottom or not melting enough in the 25 minutes I baked the cupcakes. But they came out pretty much perfect. Might be good as a one-off dessert served with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream to temper the chocolate overload. A lot like pricier restaurant desserts.

I made this for as a dessert for a college Homecoming tailgate party.  It was very easy to make and was very popular People fought over the last piece! I will definitely make this again in the future.

Tasted great. Very moist and chocolaty! Better yet, it was really easy to make. I did change the recipe to make it healthier according to the suggestions posted. I substituted low-fat plain yogurt for the sour cream, apple sauce for vegetable oil, found a fat-free chocolate pudding mix, and used 4 egg whites and 2 eggs as opposed to 4 eggs all together. Too bad I didn't have mini chocolate chips! I only had the normal sized ones laying around at the time, so they all sank to the bottom of the cake. I made a 2 layer 8" cake and 6 cupcakes.

OMG!!!!  THIS IS TRULY THE BEST!  Better than the chocolate blackout cakes at Costco and restaurants!  You can't go wrong with this recipe for chocolate lovers.  I made it for the first time today, following the recipe exactly and it was a smashing success at my church!    The cake is deliciously moist and rich - you don't need any frosting or glaze with it.  I was a little apprehensive about leaving the cake in the pan for 1-1/2 hours after taking out of the oven - but it came out of the pan perfectly!  Just follow the directions and you'll be very happy!

I forgot to rate this recipe when I first tried it years ago.  It is excellent.  If we are having ice cream with it, I top it with the "satiny glaze" recipe.  I have used this recipe for a fund raiser charging $25 each and sold $425 worth of cakes.  That should tell you something about how good it is.  As it gets closer to the holidays, people are asking me about ordering it.  Enjoy.

2/9/20 - I can't find an 18 oz box of cake mix any more.  My favorite, Duncan Hines, has shrunk down to 15.25 oz.  Three ounces isn't that big of a deal but I've gradually cut down the recipe.  Now I use 1/2 cup of oil and 3 eggs to get the same results.  Enjoy!

My husband and I ate the whole thing in less than 3 days.  He's been asking me to make it again ever since! I didn't have chocolate cake mix or chocolate pudding on hand, so I used a white cake mix and vanilla pudding and then added cocoa powder (probably about 1 cup) and extra oil (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup) until the flavor and consistancy was correct.  I was surprised at how well it turned out-absolutely delicious!

I have made this several times and always get compliments.  I've always made it with the mini chocolate chips and am going to try a better brand larger chip the next time, as they don't seem to melt as I would have thought.  I usually heat a can of bought chocolate icing in the microwave until it is warm, about a minute, then drizzle it over the top.  Makes for a beautiful cake that is also delicious.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy.  I have made this cake 2 times now with the Satiny chocolate glaze from this site.  After I added the chocolate glaze I also added heath bits to the top of that and not only is it beautiful but a chocoholics dream come true!

made as is perfect. to feel a little less guilt about eating more than one slice i will normally make this using apple sauce for oil and i like the mini chips becuse they do not sink and you get little chocolate dots throughout the cake. also top with satiny chocolate glaze from ar.

I decided to try this cake out last night and it was amazing! I used just a tiny bit less oil because of someone else's review but I can honestly say that the right amount of oil won't hurt it. This cake doesn't even need frosting! I had my mom pick up cream cheese frosting and we haven't even opened it. The outside has a delicious crumbly rougher texture ( I don't know how to explain it) and the inside has this gooey center that's to die for. Love it!

WONDERFUL! I followed the ingrediants exactly. Didn't have mini-chocolate chips...so my husband spent 20 min crushing up regular ones. Made a 2 lay 8" cake for my son's birthday. Iced it with the "chocolate cheese frosting" from this site.

Just plain wonderful and wouldn't change a thing.  The only thing to watch out for is to make sure you use the correct size bundt cake pan.  This cake rises quite a bit.  I didn't know how big my pan was and it turned out being too small and had to crank the temp down at the end and bake a little longer.  My problem though and nothing to do with the recipe!  Made with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site, as others suggested.  It was chocolate perfection and so easy.  This ones a keeper!

Awesome!  Wonderful!  But it should be called NEVER Too Much Chocolate Cake, shouldn't it?  I'm planning to make this for an upcoming pot luck at work.  I'm sure they will love it as much as I did! I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site to top this cake and it was delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was definitely the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I brought some to work and the next day someone offered to pay me to make their birthday cake.

You can never have too much chocolate! This cake was amazing! I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of 1% milk (1 cup of oil is a little much). Batter seems thick when you mix it but the cake come out perfect! I also used the mini chocolate chips to prevent them from sinking. Baked in bundt pan at 325 degrees for 55 minutes and it was perfect! Top of the cake had a little crispy bite and inside was so moist! And this cake is super easy to put together!

This is by far a new favorite!!!!  I have already made this cake several times over the past couple of months for birthdays, get-togethers, etc. and I always get rave reviews.  This cake turns out extremely extremely moist and the chocolate chips give this a great sweet treat!!!  I am going to try white chocolate chips the next time I make this just to try a variation!!!  Kudos on a great recipe!!!!

Awesome cake!  I was a little skeptical about using a "doctored up" cake mix, but since I've had such bad luck with other chocolate cake recipes, I thought I'd try it.    I did follow other's suggestions and the only changed the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/3 cup milk.  I also used mini chocolate chips. I only had 9" round cake pans so I split it between two. I left it in for 55 minutes and it was done perfect. I can't have a cake without frosting, so I used the "Whipped Cream-Cream Cheese Frosting" recipe from this site and sprinkled coconut on top. Everyone loved the cake and frosting combo as it wasn't too sweet.  No one could believe this came from a box mix!

Delicious!!!  Made it exactly as stated and added store bought frosting.  I just microwaved it for a few seconds and drizzled it on.  I got a lot of compliments!!  Oh yeah - I did use the mini chocolate chips.  Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Tip: I always use brand name cake mix and pudding mix (like Betty Crocker cake mix and Jello pudding), as the store brands aren't as good.  My family's new favorite!

WOW! Phenomenal 5* recipe. Very moist and rich. I made it in a round pan, used toffee pudding mix instead of chocolate, topped it with chocolate glaze. My friends loved it. Its one of my favourites now.

Unbelievable!  Make no substitutions. . . to die for.  I made this cake in a bundt pan, sliced then froze individual servings and can enjoy a delicious piece of cake when ever I want.  I thaw/warm a slice in the microwave, pour a glass of ice cold milk. . . . MMMMMMMMMMMMM!

Did anyone else have any problems with this cake not baking the whole way through?  I followed the directions exactly and still had poor results.  I am a very experienced baker so i cant blame inexperience.  Mine ended up burning around the edges and not being done in the middle??  I think i will try another style of pan instead of the bundt pan (i used a silicone bundt...maybe that was the problem).

I'm not a big fan of chocolate cake, but if I were, this would be the way to go.  Made the recipe just as suggested (used the mini chips) and it came out wonderfully.  I topped it with a chocolate ganache and it was eaten up without any being thrown out-which is rare for a cake in our house.

This is a great recipe, almost exactly the same as "Easy chocolate chip pound cake" which I have been making for years. The only difference I can see is that the other recipe uses yellow cake mix and only 3/4 cup of oil. Highly recommend reducing the oil in this recipe to 3/4 cup instead of a whole cup! This cake is easy to make and is always a hit anywhere I take it. REVISION: The other cake only calls for 1/2 cup chocolate chips and this one says use Two Cups!! I can see now why it's called Too Much Chocolate Cake! LOL

quiet possibly the most fattening-unhealthy thing I have EVER made- can you fit more chemicals/fat/sugar in a recipe?  Not sure, but everyone raved about it so it's a keeper!  Didn't frost it and everyone said they were glad it wasn't frosted...

I can see how this cake took First Place! I just made this cake for the 4th time this summer.  As I placed the cake in the oven, I said, "Julia and Julie would be proud of me!"  If you haven't seen the movie, I give it 2 thumbs up. The aroma in the house is wonderful.

I have made this cake several times.  Very easy to make.  It gets compliments every time!  I like to add the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" to top it off.

Hey this is my recipe!...been making it since 1986, only mine calls for 1/2 cup of oil, 1 may be too much. Always a hit with chocolate lovers. Has to bake for at least 55 min. or will be gooey in the middle.

I used applesauce instead of the oil, fat free pudding and low fat sour cream.  I think it might have been a little more moist if I had just cut the oil in half and used half applesauce...but over all a great cake served warm with ice cream!

Fantastic!  First time making this (not the last), so I followed the measurements exactly (nervous about the oil, but it was perfect).  I beat the egg whites separately until they got frothy, added the beaten yolks and the rest of the wet ingredients, and mixed slowly into the dry.  I would recommend preparing the pan with a dusting of dark cocoa.  I used a wheat flour and sugar mix for a carmel color.  Also used the satiny chocolate glaze from this site, and decorated with toasted walnut and mini chocolate chip pieces.  SO GOOD!!!  Buy vanilla ice cream to go with.

Too bad there isn't a six star rating - I'd use it!!  My hubby smelled the chocolate in the air two hours after I took this cake out of the oven. He took a bite and closed his eyes. I had to lock it up to keep him from eating the entire thing!  :)  I used another reviewer's suggestion of 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk. I also baked it for 50 min at 330, then for another 10-15 at 350 and it was perfect - very moist! Extremely yummy recipe!

Made this for a special occasion and was not let down!  I used mini chocolate chips and two 9 inch rounds so that the cooking time could be cut down and I could avoid the "crust" others talked about.  I used a whipped cream/cream cheese frosting and covered that with a chocolate ganache.  It was perfect.  I found crumbs the next day on the counter next to the empty cake plate as hubby couldn't keep his hands off it!  By far the best souped up cake mix recipe!

I made this recipe in large cupcake tins.  They are great.  They look like chocolate chocolate chip muffins.  I will definately make this again.

After reading the reviews about this cake I decided to take it on. The ingredients seemed easy. Took the advice of the other reviewers and reduced the oil to 1/2 and added 1/3 cup of milk. I only added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, was a little afraid it was going to be too chocolatly. Mixing the chocolate cips in a tsp. of flour helped them from sinking. Cooked it at 335 degrees for about 35 mins. In the end it turned out to actually be a very delicious cake that my family enjoyed.

I have made this cake several times, and it never disappoints.  It's my "go to" chocolate cake recipe every time.  Use mini chocolate chips for the best results.

I followed just as written and it was fantastic. As others have said, if you don't love chocolate, don't make this. It's chocolatey, rich,super moist, super delicious. I made a caramel glaze to go on top. Will be a regular for me.

I make this all the time!  I think my recipe actually calls it Death by Chocolate.  It's so easy to make.  In the past if I've been out of chocolate pudding, I've substituted all sorts of flavors with excellent results.

I didnt really "try" this, just licked the spoon as was very good. I used this to with the "Satiny Chococlate Glaze" on this site - with strawberries - and sent to work with my husand. 2 hours later the cake was gone and people were following him around asking for the recipe and saying how awesome it was. Will make again for sure, and eat some myself next time too! Side note - I did use fat free sour cream and sub'd 1/2 the oil for unsweetened applesauce.

Was looking for a fast, easy cake to make for a birthday party at work. Birthday boy requested a chocolate PNB cake, so I am going to try this one. After it sits awhile, I will spread some peanut butter on it.  Cool in the frig and then frost with a chocolate butter cream frosting.    Now how bad can that be?   NEXT DAY.  THE OFFICE LOVED IT.  THIS IS A KEEPER FOR ME.

OMG!!!  This so yummy.  I can't keep my husband out of it.   I followed the recipe exactly except I used mini bunt cake pans and baked for 20 min. instead.  Now I try to keep them in the freezer for company but like I said I can't keep my husband out.

No one ever guessed that this was a doctored up cake mix recipe!  It was so moist.  I have made it several times and like to either sprinkle powdered sugar on top or pour the satiny chocolate glaze from this website over it. Both turn out very elegant looking.

I took another reviewer's suggestion to substitute apple sauce for the oil and use fat free sour cream (I am down 16 lbs and counting, so I cut calories and fat wherever I can) - this was the moistest cake ever! Everyone at my dinner party loved it. I didn't have a bundt pan so I used two round cake pans. The cake spilled over (too much batter to hold) but no one cared how ugly it looked because the taste was great. I served it with a bit of cool whip on the side.

Everyone really liked the cake. My sister wanted the recipe on her first bit. I added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips instead of the 2 as others suggested and turned out great. It's easy to make with good results.

Used this for my father's day dessert as my dad looooooves chocolate cake (and so do I).  I used 2 9" round pans and made a nice layer cake, frosted with a simple chocolate frosting.  The cakes were baked on friday and then assembled on sunday since a lot of the reviews said that it was best the next day.  I omitted the chocolate chips.  Everyone loved it.

This is an excellent recipe for basic chocolate cake.  I've made it several times as per the original instructions and it's come out very moist and delicious every time.  I covered it with a chocolate ganache recipe from this site.  Today I am making a 4 layer cake with peanut butter frosting in between the layers of the chocolate cake and then covering with chocolate frosting from the Hershey's Dutch Chocolate tin. Great go-to recipe for chocolate cake.  Never fails to impress.

i made this again recently. i took a hard look at what the box called for in terms of eggs/water/oil and how much more i was adding and what additional things i was adding.
and the end recent is not THAT impressive. it tastes like a boxed cake. 
and then i got to thinking of what is in a boxed cake, and i'm sorta grossed out.
this "recipe" is easy, it's quick, and it does taste good but for what i'm looking for- a real cake recipe- this is not it.

FANTASTIC!  I made a few changes, instant choc. pudding that had little caramel chips in it, and some choc. chips mixed in and a whole package of heath pieces mixed in.  This was fantastic!  Very dense and rich, yet light and delicious at the same time! Made it for my husband's birthday.  He LOVED it.  Making again for fathers day.  Used the satiny glaze recipe and sprinkled heath pieces on top.  This cake is something you would find in a 5 star restaurant.  YUMMY YUMMY!!!

Good cake, but I wouldn't suggest putting a lot of icing on it like I did.  Way too much sugar!  It would be very good just keeping it simple.

This cake turned out really well! We throughly have been enjoying it. It is very rich. My husband and I like it with vanilla ice cream to even out it's richness. And I would love to make the glaze that I see on the picture but had no idea how so settled for the powered sugar.

When I first mixed up this cake I wasn't so sure, it was awfully thick and I had to push it down into the pan.  I was sure that I had done something wrong - 1400 great reviews doesn't lie.  Anyway, it came out so unbelievably delicious.  Even better the second day.  I used sugar free pudding, low fat sour cream, and apple sauce instead of oil and it was still unbelievable.  I brought about half the cake into work and it didn't even last the morning.  Yummy.  Sidenote: I made this for my dads birthday and he has a gluten allergy so I tried to sub in gluten free cake mix - the dang thing never set.  I tried to bake it longer but it ended up burning.  This is just an FYI in case anyone tries to swap out cake mixes, give yourself some time to experiment instead of procrastinating (like me) and then scrambling at the last minute to throw together a plain ol' cake from the gluten free cake mix instructions.

This cake is fantastic. I made it with a German chocolate cake mix and the mini chocolate chips. I also added about 2TBS of chocolate syrup in with the 1/2 cup of water. There was so much cake batter though that I filled up my bunt cake pan and a round cake pan. I had no chocolate frosting so I added some chocolate syrup to some vanilla frosting to put in between the layers of cake and I then I added coconut pecan frosting to the rest of it. It is sooo good. I will certinaly make this again.

This turned out pretty good. I think I overbaked it a bit and it was kinda dry. Will try it again though! (Did try it with a stawberry cake mix and white chocolate morsels. It was okay but I wouldn't recommend it b/c the white choc. chips can't take the heat that long like a regular choc. chip. They sorta scorched in the cake. It was eatable but I won't make it like that again.)

Very good and easy recipe...Used what I had on hand - 1 pkg. (3.9oz) Vanilla Pudding, Light Sour Cream and Mini chocolate ships! I have made this several times using the ingredients stated in recipe and this time was as good as all the rest!! Thanks for sharing!

mmmmm..... this cake is dangerous!!!! After I finished my first slice, I wanted to sit with the whole cake in front of me and eat it all by myself!!!!lol!!! This is a very simple cake that comes out perfect! I used what I had in my pantry- German Chocolate cake mix and only 1 cup of chocolate chips.. otherwise I follow the reciepe to the T. I served it with a berry sauce on top (YUM) 2 cups chopped berries(I used strawberries but I think next time I'll try raspberries!!!) 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, 1 Tbl lemon juice, and 1 tsp cornstarch~~ Combine water, lemon juice, cornstarch and sugar in pot over medium heat. Stir well to dissolve cornstarch, then add fruit. Simmer for 5-10 minutes. This sauce really complements this cake. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!! Can't wait to make it again!!

Although this is too much chocolate for sure...yet it taste too 'processed'.  If you want to eat highly processed dessert, go for it.  It was good but can't get the fact that it was made from highly processed food items...

To my disappointment, this was just "okay". It was a really thick dense cake, almost like a brownie. I used the recipe twice, for cupcakes and a 13x9 cake. I don't think I will make a third time.

for one-bowl. mix-and-bake cake this is pretty good. Certainly there are better cakes out there, but none easier than this. I thought it was ok out of the oven, but much better after a day in the fridge. It's a also a very sturdy cake, so you can do a lot with it as far as layering and decorating.

This cake is very good. I have one not so good thing to report, but is has nothing to do with the recipe, I used my silicone bunt pan and unfortunately it was too small, so I had to cut of a good 1/3 of the cake, because it had risen too high and was burning on the heating element of the oven. Other than that the cake is moist, very chocolately and I love it. I will make this again, not too soon though, because this cake is very rich.

This was amazing.  I made it exactly as written, except that I also added 1 cup of milk by mistake.  I was afraid I'd ruined it, but it came out just fine and didn't even need extra baking time.  Don't know if that made it better or worse than it should have been, but my family ate it right up!

I made this recipe 1/2 into cupcakes and 1/2 into a cake. The cupcakes reminded me of the taste of molten cake. I sprinkle the cupcakes with powdered sugar. The mini chocolate chips were in every bite. This recipe is a keeper.  I haven't yet decided how to top to cake yet. I am in Chocolate Heaven. Yum!!!

I was not very impressed with this cake.  You can definitely tell that it was made with cake mix, it actually kind of tastes like one of those chocolate muffins you can get at the grocery store bakery.  It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't live up to its 5 star review.

Good and SUPER easy with a stand mixer! I made it topped with the satiny chocolate glaze as suggested by another reviewer. Would make it again and would be good to bring to a party or potluck. I am going to try cupcakes next time. Used Duncan Hines mix.

UPDATE:
I make this cake every year for my neighbors birthday. This year, I used store brand devils food cake. It was just as good and half the price. I also accidentally bought cook and serve pudding! Oh no! I didn't realize until after I dumped in one box. I had to figure out how to save the cake. I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, the water to 1/4 cup and only used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips. Voila! It turned out as good as normal! So if you accidentally buy the wrong pudding, no fear! Use this as your guide. I am increasing my review to 5 stars cause this is soooo easy and tastes like it took you all day. This time, I used the vanilla glaze from this site and it was great!

This cake is so good I find myself dreaming about it. And I don't really eat sweets. I am making it in cupcake form for a dinner party this weekend and I can't wait. I use the ganache recipe on this site which is so easy and I whipped it in the Kitchen Aid and just incredible. All I can say is WOW!

DELICIOUS! i accidentally added an extra cup of water and was afraid it would ruin the cake, but it was still seriously sooo goood!!!! i cut back the oil to 3/4 cup. i bake in a 9x13 or 2 9x9. it tastes even better the next day. this recipe is a keeper!! thanks for sharing the recipe :)
update: ive made this several times and everyone always looves it. the one time i made it with only half a cup of water i felt it wasnt gooey and moist enough, so i always add a bit more. this is my favourite cake to make!! i just hate it when ppl ask me how i made it --i hate telling them i used a box mix!!! i frost with french vanilla frosting and then swirls of chocolate frosting and choc sprinkles. just amazing!!!!

Amazing Cake!!  Very easy to make!  I reduced the oil to 2/3 C..  It was amazing!!!  I've made it about 6x now & I decorate it with the "Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Icing"!  Yummy!!!
**It does get crispy if you cook it at 350 the whole time though...maybe try baking it at 350 for 20 min & then reduce it to 325**

Wow! This was amazing!I made it for my best friends birthday. I did it in 2, very well greased round 9 inch pans.I baked them at 350 (My oven isn't very hot) They baked for 50 minutes and came out perfect. I used Raspberry perserves for the filling and then I frosted it with chocolate frosting II I think. I used 3/4c. oil and 1 1/4c. mini chocolate chips. I used a dark chocolate cake mix. My favorite cake ever!!!

I didn't have semisweet chocolate chips to add, but I really wish I would have went out of my way to get some because I can imagine the impact they would have had! This recipe was wonderful even without them. I made cupcakes and poured ganache made from a recipe on this site and they were a big hit! I never had such moist cupcakes!

I changed a couple of things: I used yellow cake mix and instead of chocolate pudding, I used banana cream pudding mix and added mini chocolate chips. Also used the Satiny chocolate Glaze as a frosting, DELISH!!!!! One of the best cakes I've made so far!!!!

This cake was very easy, and was fabulous! I made it for my son's 14th birthday and it was a huge hit. He wanted some type of frosting, so I used 1 can of sweetened condensed chocolate, heated it and added one cup of semi-sweet chocolate and glazed the cake. Yummy!!

Well, I didn't make this cake but one of my co-workers did for a birthday celebration and it is FANTASTIC!!! This cake is so moist and the chocolate chips add that perfect 'oomph' to an already fantastic recipe. I will definitely be making this cake myself in the not too distant future!

Really great!  I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil; egg beaters instead of eggs, fat free sour cream, sugar free pudding, and mini choc. chips.  It was really rich, so next time I will try a 1/4 less applesauce and a 1/4 less choc. chips.  This was my first time baking with the lower fat ingredients, and you really can't tell the difference.  It's def. worth saving the calories!

Absolutely awesome!  I took this to a work event and it was a huge success and unfortunately for me, there were no leftovers.  I used ghiradelli semi-sweet choc chips and it was fantastic.

Wow!  Best "doctored" cake mix recipe I've ever eaten.  Super moist texture and chocolaty flavor. I used a pudding-included devil's food cake mix to simplify a step.  I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion of adding mini chocolate chips for more even distribution, and I'm glad I did. Be sure you wait to dust it with powdered sugar until right before cutting and serving, or the sugar will absorb moisture and melt into the top, losing its pretty look. I served it with sliced strawberries which really made that rich chocolate flavor pop!

Great cake!!  I used fat free pudding mix, fat free sour cream, 1/2 c oil, 1/2 cup apple sauce, liquid eggs, 1/2 cup skim milk and only 1 cup mixed chipits...(trying a little lighter version).  Turned out great.  Thanks for sharing!!

I give it a 4 because I can still tell it's a mix cake.  Everyone loved it.  It was very elegant, I made it in a spring form pan, so it looked like a restaurant chocolate cake.  Used previous advice: only 1/2 c oil, low-fat sour cream, and Satiny Chocolate Glaze.

This is my go to recipe for every cake mix! My most recent cake was a butter pecan cake with buttercream icing, I added vanilla pudding pudding mix. I will never make another cake mix without these enhancements again!

GREAT cake for chocolate lovers. Extremely moist and rich. Try this cake with french vanilla ice cream, drizzle with hot fudge, then top with chopped nuts and whipped cream. DIVINE! Thanks for the recipe. I used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" icing recipe from this site and it could have been better.  Next time I'm going to give the chocolate ganache a try.  Plus, I may use milk chocolate chips (mini!) instead of semi-sweet. Everyone raved about this cake on the first try! Will definitely make again for picnics, parties, you name it...

Hmmm...I don't know what to say about this cake.  My first attempt was a total mess and never cooked through even after over an hour in the oven.  I realized that I used the smaller box of pudding mix so I tried again.  The second time I did a little research and found this exact recipe but with 1/2 c. of oil and the smaller pudding size.  This time it baked just fine but I still wasn't that impressed with the cake.  It was very heavy and dense.  Not as moist as I like even with all that extra fat.  Maybe I'm just a total cheapskate but I think that 1.25 for cake mix, 2.50 for chocolate chips, 1.00 for sour cream, 1.00 for pudding, 4 eggs, and an entire cup of oil makes for a pretty expensive recipe.  I won't be making this again.  The next time I need a good chocolate cake, I'll use "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III."  One good thing I got out of using this recipe is the suggestion by other reviewers to use "Satiny Chocolate Glaze."  That was excellent.

It is Chocolately. I did have to cook it for a little bit longer than it called for.  I can't say I didn't like it, but I do have a recipe I like better.  Thanks for the recipe.

Without a doubt one of the best (and easiest) chocolate cake recipes ever.  I made it for the first time for DIL's birthday, using 2 nine inch pans.  I did decrease the oil by half and used light sour cream. Was concerned about how thick the batter was - think brownie mix - but gave it a go anyway.  Baked at 350 for 55 minutes.  The cake came out perfect.  Also made Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe (doubled) from this site. Rave reviews from everyone.  My go to recipe for chocolate cake from now on.

If you like chocolate cake, then you'll love this one. I used yogurt instead of sour cream. It was very very moist. Everyone at the party I took it to thought it was great.
 EDIT DEC 2011::: I've made this cake many many times now and always follow the recipe as is, but trading yogurt for sour cream. There really is no need for all the other alterations reviews mention as this cake is great as the recipe is written. Just top with your favourite topping and you're good to go!
EDIT SEPT 2014:This recipe is now my secret weapon! Using this as a base and always using yogurt in stead of sou, I've made all sorts of yummy things. I used white cake with lemon pudding and used blueberries in place of the chocolate chips, filled the layers with a blueberry reduction and topped with a light blueberry butter cream. I used white cake with pistachio pudding and chopped pistachios in place of chocolate chips and topped with a pistachio stabilized whipped cream frosting. Most recently, I used white cake with vanilla pudding, chopped fresh peaches in place of chocolate chips, and topped with a vanilla whipped cream frosting. Everyone has been begging me for the recipes!

This cake was so yummy. I only used 1 1/4 cups of chocolate chips rather than 2 cups but 2 cups would have been just fine. When I poured the batter into the pan it was very thick and I was worried how it would turn out but it turned out great and very moist. I did not use chocolate icing as that is too much chocolate for me so I sued a buttercream icing instead. Very good! I will definitely make this cake again.

Stop reading reviews ans START making the cake. It is basically heaven in a pan. I made it for my husbands birthday and everyone, everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly...but used low fat sour cream instead. It is the best dessert I have ever made. Everyone asked for the recipe!

took advice from a previous reviewer and made lowfat substitutions (applesauce for oil, eggs whites for eggs, ff sour cream, sugar free cake mix, sugar free pudding mix) and this cake was TO DIE FOR.  Absolutely wonderful and guilt free!

Absolutely amazing - I just used reduced fat sour cream and fat free jello to make me feel A LITTLE less guilty.  Served with vanilla ice cream and it was to die for!  I can't wait to start experimenting with the different chocolate chip and pudding flavors as someone else suggested.  :)

After reading all of the 5 star reviews I was really expecting something out of this world. Well you have to be TRUE CHOCOLATE LOVER to really appreciate this cake. I followed the recipe exactly and made cup cakes. They were okay but nothing to brag about. My husband is a middle school teacher so I think I'll send the cupcakes to work with him  on tomorrow to give to his students. They might appreciate them much more than I did.

The Best Cake Recipe I have ever used. I followed what one person suggested and used applesauce instead of oil with sugar free pudding and low fat sour cream. I LOVED it. Simply Amazing!

This cake was delicious and moist!  Everyone LOVED it!  I added the Satiny Chocolate Glaze icing and topped with crushed thin mint cookies.  I also made it in a 9 x 13 pan and it cooked perfectly.

Moist moist cake! I substituted applesauce for oil. We found that the cake was 10x better on day 2. It grew in flavor and moistness. YUM!

This is a GREAT cake!  I was a little worried from other reviews about too much oil, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was moist and delicious.  55 minutes was perfect in my bundt pan.  Used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze- easy and delicious.  It drizzled exactly like the picture.

I made this yesterday for my brother's birthday and it was amazing! I used mint chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, which was a fabulous decision. Like others, I also used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from the site - and again used the mint chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and it was an unbelievable combination. Do it. You won't be sorry.

Turned out as advertised--moist and so chocolaty. I followed the recipe except I used a whole pack of mini chocolate chips. I had trouble getting it done. I baked it another 10 minutes at 350, and when it still wasn't done I turned the temp down to 335 and baked another 15 minutes. Next time I'm going to try less oil and see if that takes care of it. This recipe is so delicious and easy that it's worth experimenting with to figure out the cook time.

My fraternity had a bake-off this week and I was crunched for time but still wanted to make something to knock their socks off. This worked fabulously and I got so many complements on the cake! I altered it just slightly by substituting one of the cups of semi-sweet chips for chopped white chocolate chips, and for the other cup I used the suggestion of mini chips. I also made it into a layer cake which required just under 30 min to bake. Between the layers I used raspberry preserves and I topped the cake with a white chocolate glaze recipe I found on this site (originally used for cookies) and fresh raspberries. I'm eating the one little bit left over now and it is so good!

This turned out nicely and came right of the bundt cake pan without problem. I planned on substituting the pudding mix with the dry ingredients from the "Hasty Chcolate Pudding" recipe on this site because I wanted to make this and had no pudding mix. I also went to put in the sour cream and my sour cream was bad, so I substituted 3/4 milk, 3/4 tbsp lemon juice (to make buttermilk) and 1/3C butter as found on substitutions list on this website. The cake still turned out great! (Next time I will have to check my ingredients better before I start)

I've been searching for a perfect moist and dense cake for my fondant cakes and this is it!  It's got a great texture and it really delicious.  I didn't use the chips when I made the chocolate cake, but will try it in the future.  Also, you can make any flavor cake with this recipe (I would omit the chips), just make sure to match the pudding with the flavor of cake mix.

This cake is to die for! All my friends ask for the recipe and always go back for seconds!  For the chocolate topping I prefer to use the fudge sauce that you put on ice cream.... I drizzle it over the top.

Wow, this is one of the best chocolate cake recipes I have tried ever.  I made cupcakes by baking at 325 for 20 minutes.   The only changes I made were reducing the oil to 3/4 of a cup.

Out of this world!! For chocolate lovers only. Made true to recipe. Used mini chocolate chips. I even made it in the microwave. Use a bundt pan made of stone. Got mine from pampered chef. Only takes 10 min.

This time I only had a small box of pudding, so I didn't add the water and it was amazing.

Title really speaks for itself, Very unique cake but I wish I had put in less cocoa; one, because it's a little to much for me and family of seven, and two, I wasted all my cocoa powder. I'll be looking for a new recipe one but wouldn't hurt to try this one out.

We added chopped hazelnuts and used Ghiardelli dark chocolate chips to make this into what I would consider to be the best cupcakes ever.  As we were mixing it my friend and I both commented that it was going to be way too dense and rich, but when they came out of the oven we discovered just how wrong we were.  Delicious!  We'll be using this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

This is a great, simple recipe.  You don't need frosting - in fact, that would probably be over the top.  It's really rich and delicious exactly as it is.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls, though I didn't sprinkle with powdered surgar at the end.  It's great still warm from the oven, I just used a rectangular pan instead of the bundt pan and it was fine - meant I didn't have to take it out of the pan at all.  Very yummy - great for kids and adults.

Oh my! This recipe completly rocks! I added 3/4 Cup peanut butter chips and 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Also, after I greased the pan I dusted it with finely chopped pecans (this also kept it from sticking to the pan). Next I used the DELICIOUS glaze recipe (found on this site) and coated the cake with it. The glaze recipe was 1 can Sweetened Condensed Milk and 1 cup chocolate chips...melt them in the microwave then mix well, then add about a teaspoon of vanilla. While the glaze is hot pour it over the cake and allow it to set. THE BEST BUNDT CAKE EVER! Sooooo tasty and I got rave reviews!

All I can say is "Wow!"  This was a great cake.  I did not change a thing.  I used "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" from this site as well.  I will make this again and again.

This cake is fantastic! I decided to follow the recipe despite the tips to use less oil and it still came out awesome. I made a few changes and used sugar free pudding mix, light sour cream, and mini choco chips. and the cake turned out wonderful. It is very moist. I turned the cake into cupcakes instead and topped them with a little dollop of vanilla icing and garnished them with a some left over mini chocolate chips. AMAZING! BEAUTIFUL! I will 100% be making this cake again!

This cake was wonderful! I made it for Valentines dinner in a heart shaped pan and sprinkled it with powdered sugar. It was moist with the perfect amount of chocolate. My kids loved the melted chocolate chips in the center. My daughter doesn't like cake because of the icing, she ate 2 pieces and asked for more. I will definately make again!

Very very good. I didn't have any pudding so I just used extra sour cream (about an extra cup) and it was fantastic!!  I also made a caramel glaze from an apple cake recipe on here to top it and it was awesome!!

I followed this recipe exactly and was not overwhelmingly impressed at all. It was good, but nothing special. I made it for my chocoholic son's 12th bday today and was somewhat disappointed. It was definitely pretty and the consistency was fine..it was just the flavor that was a bit lacking.

Chocolate cake is one of those things that I don't usually crave. But since I was baking a birthday cake for one of my staff, he chose chocolate. I used this recipe, and made it as directed (except used one box of 1.9 oz pudding. It turned out SO rich and delicious. I also used Satiny Chocolate Glaze and would do it again.

I cut the oil down to 1/2 cup as suggested and the cake was wonderful.  It is very rich but if you love chocolate, this is the cake for you.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake was very easy.  I think there is an error in the size of the pudding box.  I used a 1.5 oz box of sugar free, fat free and it turned out fabulous.  I also recommend topping it with the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake glaze.  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Easy-Chocolate-Bundt-Cake-Glaze/Detail.aspx?prop31=1  mmmm delicious!  Perfect for Valentines day!

Oh yum, this was amazing!  It does NOT taste like a boxed cake.  I used half oil/half applesauce and about 1.5 cups of chocolate chips, 2 seemed excessive.  I was going to make the satiny glaze but the cake was so rich and delicious I ended up eating it plain.

Unfortunately, this cake was really TOO much chocolate for us. My husband and kids only took a bite each and said it was way too rich for them.  I had to throw out most of the cake, and food never goes to waste in my house.  Give me a moist fudge brownie over this cake any day!

This was a fantastic recipe, and it was so easy to make!  I just bought my first bundt pan, so I needed a bundt cake recipe.  After reading the rave reviews for this cake, I decided to try it.  I'm so glad I did!  I did make some modifications though.  I only had a 3.9 oz box of pudding, so I just used that.  I also only used one cup of mini chocolate chips, fearing that it would be too rich.  I think that one cup of chocolate chips was definitely enough, as the cake was very chocolatey and rich anyway!  This got rave reviews from my co-workers and family and stayed pretty moist for several days.  I used the recipe for Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site as a topping.  Next time I'll try making it with the larger box of pudding.

I have been wanting to make this for so long. So I made it for our big comfort food meal tonight. I didn't have semi-sweet chips so I used milk chocolate. It was very good. Kids loved it! I didn't do a glaze but I think it would be even better with one.

I used this recipe for two layers of my wedding cake. I therefore didn't use a bunt pan, but a regular round shape.  I used a little bit less chocolate chips because I was worried they would take away from the support of the cake.  It all worked out perfectly.  I wanted to give the chocolate lovers at the wedding a real treat. They asked for chocolate and they got it.    I have also made this since the wedding as a birthday cake for a friend and roommate, and the cake remains got eaten for breakfast everyday, and everyday it got better.  I will continue making this cake for the rest of my life! I don't even want to try others.  For the icing I used a package of chocolate jello pudding mixed with regular vanilla icing (leftover Betty Crocker) and it went perfectly with this cake.

Very chocolatey and rich. I made cupcakes and baked for 20 mins. I would definitely recommend mini chips because I used regular ones and they all sank to the bottom and make the paper stick to the cupcake.

I know this is cake so I should'nt worry too much about calories, but I took anothers advice and replaced oil with unsweetend applesauce and used sugar free pudding.  Still great.  I can only imagine what its like with the "fatty stuff."

DO NOT BE ALARMED by the consistency of the batter when you are ready to put it into the pan.  It is literally like sludge, and seems like it will never turn out, but it is the most moist, delicious, PERFECT chocolate cake ever!  We used the mini chocolate chips, and they were perfect as there were tiny little bits all throughout. Even though it's hard, make sure you let it cool in the pan for the full hour and a half. Also, leftover slices of this are wonderful when reheated in the microwave for about 20 seconds!

I made the mistake of forgetting to tell my husband not to buy the cake mix with the pudding in it.  I used it anyways and it came out way to soft.  BUY MIX WITHOUT PUDDING.  I cut back on the oil to 1/2 cup, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup of coffee and cooked it at 350 for 50 minutes.  Even though I didn't make it correct it was eaten up within 2 hours at work.  Everyone loved it.  So, it's really good even when you don't make it right.  DON'T put in the refrigerator.  If you want to put fruit in the middle of the cake don't do it until you are ready to serve.  Sprinkle with powered sugar and I used the Santiny chocolate glaze.  Remember small pieces because 600 caleries is a lot. This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this cake twice, both times it came out great. The first time, I followed the recipe to the tee..perfect.  The second time, I used vanilla instead of chocolate pudding (I didn't want to go to the store) and used 3/4 cup of oil.  It was equally delicious.  A great easy recipe for when nothing but chocolate will do!

I have baked other chocolate cakes that have gotten rave reviews from friends and co-workers, but this one "takes the cake" so to speak!  It was OUTSTANDING!  I could also tell this b/c I baked it Friday night and it was gone by Sunday morning!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used mini-morsels. They distributed perfectly in the batter!  You MUST try this recipe to truly understand!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, and this seriously is one of the best cakes I've ever eaten.  The only addition I made was that I added white icing and sprinkles to make it a birthday cake for a friend.  Honestly, though, it is sweet enough without the icing.

I as well used the recipe  Satiny Chocolate Glaze for the glaze on top of the cake. It was for sure Chocolately! My husband said it was good, i personally did not care for it. I made it for my husband's office and he said everyone else likes it, so maybe it is just me, but i'll make it again for party's and such... but again, not for me.

I made this cake for my fiance's birthday.  It is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  The first time I made the cake the outer edges were a little burnt.  The second time around I reduced the heat to 300 degrees after 20 minutes and it turned out perfect.  Excellent recipe!!!  I will be using this one again and again. :D

I read a lot of the reviews before I decided to make this cake.  It was easy to put together and bake. I used triple chocolate fudge cake mix and dropped the temp to 325 after 30 minutes.  The cake is beautiful.  I did add the chocolate satin glaze and dipped strawberries in chocolate to garnish around to add some flair.  My suggestion that if you don't like it, try the recipe again something might have gone a little haywire.

If I could give this more stars, I would!  It is perfect just the way it is.  I used the satiny chocolate glaze on top (sooo easy) and put crushed heath bar bits (buy in the baking isle) all over the top for a yummy compliment.  Cut into slivers as this is extremely rich...serve with milk!

I don't like chocolate but even I can appreciate the goodness in this cake.  I have made it several times and it is always a hit.  I follow the directions as stated except that I use mini chocolate chips instead of the regular chips.  This cake is yummy served warm with vanilla ice cream, but my husband thinks it is even better tasting on day two. The satiny chocolate glaze is a must for a topping on this cake.

I made a cube cake.  It was 5 layers with the frosting between each layer.  I used half mini and half regular ch chips, they made it more chocolaty.  It was a lot of work and a challenge to cut but definitely worth it.
A+ recipe, thank you.

I made this last nite and it turn out great! I'm a beginner in baking but i was so impress with the result. This is so moist and chocolicious. I used 1/2 cup canola oil, 1 cup plain yogurt as i can't find sour cream here. I also reduced choc chip to 1 cup. I added 1/4 tsp of baking powder as i was worried that cake box mix usualy doesn't rise very well. I used Devil's food cake mix. Oh this is the best cake i've ever tried.

I used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site and doubled it.  Also, once the cake had cooled a little, I poked some holes in it and poured some sweetened condensed milk and let it soak while it was cooling down.  The result was amazingly moist cake!!!

I had a bake off contest at my work place and had no clue what to make.. I was about to make my famous carrot cake and then I ran across this little number. I made it into a two layer cake, with homemade chocolate frosting and I made a nice creamy ganache for the middle.. I also used the left over ganache to dip strawberries and place it ontop. Everyone loved it!!! and I won the bake off!! I am so happy I tried this, I will def bake again.

I'm jumping on the bandwagon.  This cake is awesome! I, like many others, used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze, and it was wonderful.  Even my crabby old Great-Uncle (who never likes anything) said WOW!! A definate keeper for the holiday file!!

I am amazed that there is a review that "corrected" the recipe to 335 degrees.  What are you doing??  Make your own recipe entry and stop trying to "perfect" someone else's.  This recipe is perfect as written with no changes required!!

I made this for my dad's 50th birthday and got rave reviews from everyone.  I didn't have enough chocolate pudding so I used one box of chocolate and one box of vanilla.  I made this in a bundt pan with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" and also the "Dirt Cake I" recipies. I layered the dirt cake in the hole of the bundt cake (once cooled of course) topped with a gummy worm and an over the hill grave stone candle and wrote "older than dirt" around the outside.  There was more dirt cake then could fit in the middle of the cake, so I put the rest in a tupperware container for guests to take as they pleased.  The creamy part of the dirt cake complimented the chocolate cake perfectly.  A very rich combo!

For something so decadent this was very simple to make. The reward outweighs the effort by a mile. Everyone raved and I'll do this again. I covered the cake cake in a bittersweet chocolate ganache but next time I'll try a milk chocolate ganache.

Flawless!  I followed this recipe exactly with perfect results!  My dad couldn't believe it was a doctored cake mix.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added mini chocolate chips.  I also made cupcakes instead of cake.  I came out with 24 cupcakes and baked them for 19 mins.  Frosted with a butter creme frosting, but I think they're just as good on their own without the frosting.  Top recipe here!

Three words: To die for.  I made this for a holiday party dessert contest at work and beat out the cheesecake guy finally after years of trying.  I think the baking time is a little off though.  I cooked it in 2 9" round cake pans at the same time for 55 minutes.  It came out perfect and I layered them with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting from this site.  I used mini chocolate chips and sprinkled a few in with the frosting.

This is just too good. If you serve it warm, or reheat, its like a molten chocolate cake-- the best. I served it warm with cherry cake filling and whipped cream on top. Perfection.

Excellent, extremely rich chocolate cake! I dusted mine with some powdered sugar, and that is quite enough for me. I think I'd go into diabetic shock if I tried to add any kind of frosting! Easy to make and delish! Thanks.

I made this for my in-laws 60th anniversary and every one loved it.  I did the chocolate version and used Andes'Mint chips with a "few" chocolate chips and sprinkled a few on top of the chocolate glaze - no one said it was too minty.  There was some left and I was amazed at how long it stayed so moist.  Will make again - I bet it would be good with crushed up candy cane for the holidays.  YUM!

I only had a box of vanilla pudding so I used a dark chocolate cake mix. Then I stirred in toffee bits with the chocolate chips. A chocolate lover's dream especially while it is still warm. My hubby had seconds.

My Mom started baking this cake in the 1970's.  It became her "signature" cake and of course was requested at all family gatherings.  She passed away 10 years ago, but us kids and grandkids keep the tradition going.  We called it "Inside-out Chocolate Cake".  She used 1/2 c oil and frozen chocolate chips.  The cake was unmolded after just 10 minutes, but completely cooled before dusting with powdered sugar.  Even non-chocoholics love this one and for beginner bakers this is a great recipe.

Yum, this was good.  But I had some issues with the baking time....the top started burning while the middle of the cake was still gooey.  I even cut back on the oil like others had suggested.  I did make mine in a 9x13 pan, so I just took off a thin layer on the top.  It was delicious, I put chocolate fudge frosting on the top.  My chocolate lover guests really enjoyed it.

Pretty good!  I did not realize I only had a smaller box of chocolate pudding mix, but this still came out good.  I made cupcakes and they were nice and moist, and as others mentioned, even better the next day.  Based on other reviews I reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup, but frankly I think I could have done without them at all since I intended to frost the cupcakes anyway.  I used this recipe as inspiration to also make vanilla cupcakes using French vanilla cake mix and vanilla pudding (again, the smaller sized packages) and no chips.  I actually like the vanilla ones better (of course, they are slathered with chocolate frosting...).  Each batch produced 24 cupcakes, and baking time was 35 minutes for the chocolate, and 30 minutes for the vanilla.  Will make both recipes again, but if I use chocolate chips I'll just dust with powdered sugar instead of icing them.

This was terrific.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup of milk instead of all the oil. Delicious.  I also used the mini mini chocolate chips.  Use 9 inch cake pans.  It will bake over with 8 inch ones.  I iced the cake with fluffy peanut butter icing from this website.  My picky mother loved it!

Very moist! Cut the chocolate chips in the cake from 2 cups to 1 because we didn't have enough, and it still tasted great. Used the chocolate ganache recipe from this site for the frosting. Yum yum yum!

I made these as cupcakes, with the mini chocolate chips and 3/4 c oil + 1/4 cup applesauce, baked for 20 minutes, then frosted with cream cheese frosting.  A woman who had one told me she even has 2 cupcake tattoos (so obviously a cupcake fan) and that this was the best cupcake she ever had!

I followed the recipe to a T, but cut the chocolate chips to 1 cup.  I have baked 3 of these in the last couple days - and everyone is raving!  Thank you for the excellent & simple recipe that I will make many times in the future!  **follow-up:  still making this one!  I have increased water to 3/4 cup & reduced oil to same.. not that it makes a huge diff, but every little bit of fat calorie savings is a good thing!  you can't tell the difference in the outcome of the cake.. and by the way - I'm still only using 1c chips, 2c would be too many for my taste.  THANKS AGAIN!!  love it!!

I love this cake. I've made this before and I just made it again for my Superbowl party. The last time I made a chocolate glaze and this time I put a white chocolate glaze on top of mine and it was delicious and pretty. I used one of those microwavable chocolates you can use to dip fruit and I added some milk to my desired consistency. Everyone loved it and it really is such an easy cake to make.

This was pretty good, even though I am not a huge fan of chocolate cake. I am baking it for a dessert contest this Saturday and I hope it does well. I put the Satiny chocolate glaze on top which made it better. Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome, awesome chocolate cake recipe!!!  I too users advice and used mini semi-sweet morsels.  I used the "Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting" from this website and strawberry jelly for the filling.  I should have made a bigger cake because it was gone in about 10 minutes and people raved about it!!!  This is my new chocolate cake recipe!  Thank you!

I have made this recipe several times as a 9 x 13 cake and cupcakes.  This time when I made this recipe as cupcakes, the top edges and the bottom burned before the middle was even done.  The only thing I did different was I used regular sour cream and I usually use low fat.  This is a great recipe, but I will stick with low fat sour cream from now on.  Other reviewers have said that this doesn't even need frosting- sometimes I frost the cake/cupcakes and other times I've sprinkled powdered sugar on each piece and it still tastes great!  This is a keeper!

Excellent!! I loved this and I am not a fan of cake. It was perfect. I substituted applesauce for the oil and used mini chips. So good!

I consider myself a pretty good cook and always receive rave reviews but none have compared to those I got with this chocolate cake. The only thing I changed about the recipe was appearance, I made this into a 4 layer cake (frosting between each layer), and topped with dark chocolate covered strawberries. It was rich but ohhhh sooooo good.

Wow, so good!... Totaly satisfies that chocolate craving!  I actually left a copy of this recipe on the counter the day before my birthday along with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe others have used as a hint to my husband... He usually makes me a box cake with BC frosting.  He took the challenge and now he'll never let me forget how great a baker he is!!!  lol...  I'll just keep letting him be the baker and I'll be the eater!  =)

We love this recipe.  Have made it a few times now and here's what we've learned.  It's just as good without the chocolate chips.  If you do put the chocolate chips, use the mini ones if you want them to melt fully.  The regular size chips don't melt down all the way.  It has a nice texture and is easy to frost.  We use the chocolate fudge buttercream frosting or no frosting at all!  It's a good cake just on it's own. Give it a try for an easy way to make a cake that tastes like it's "from scratch."

Everyone loved this cake. It was moist, and very chocolatety. One of those cakes you say, "got milk". When it was refrig. you can have a little crunch from the chocolate chips. It was very good and I'd make this cake again.

Absolutely delicious!  I am a chocoholic and this definitely hit the spot!  Not too sweet, loved the chips throughout the cake - a little burst of chocolate surprise with every bite.  Used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (doubled the recipe) and ended up with a very elegant cake - did not taste like a boxed mix at all.  Paired with a glass of milk and I think I've died and gone to heaven!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Great cake and super easy.  I've made it both in layer form with whipped ganache for icing and in bundt form (peanut butter chips at another reviewer's suggestion) with confectioner's sugar dusting.  Pretty much awesome any way.

Amazing!  I did add about 3/4 cup of sour cream, because I did not have a full carton.  It still turned out super moist.  I stirred it by hand until everything was just barely mixed.  I thought at first that I had added too many chocolate chips, but it turned out awesome.  My sister-in-law and husband loved it (me too)!

This was so delicious and easy! I made this for Mother's Day for both my mom and mom in law. I made the following changes according to other reviewers: used about 2 cups of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and I substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 the oil. The baking time took longer in my bundt pan and I turned down the temp to 325 or so near the end. It was so moist. I used powdered sugar as the recipe said. It stayed moist for days out of the refrigerator. This is a definite keeper.

ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT! Made this for my husbands birthday tonight, he is a huge chocolate fan and usually wants ice cream cake, but after he had this he was hooked, and we've coined this "birthday cake" now! I took others suggestions and used "satiny chocolate glaze" recipe from this site, and its the PERFECT match. I followed the recipe exactly, used the full cup of oil and didn't see the need to cut back. Next time I will try making cupcakes out of this with that glaze...YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS RECIPE! Also important to note: taste of chocolate is awesome, and its not too rich, you can go back for seconds without salivating for a drink!

Wow!  This has to be the most moist cake I've ever eaten.  As other reviewers said, I noticed it was even better the longer it sits.  I topped with the satiny glaze from this site and then topped with mini chocolate chips.  Super chocolately!  My bf loved it.  Def will make again.

YUM! this recipe was so moist and delicious- will be my 'go to" chocolate cake recipe. I made this for my boyfriends bday cake with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site- everyone loved it! My only suggestion is to definitely use mini choc chips if you dont like the texture of the chips in your cake. I used reg choc chips which everyone liked except me! Otherwise a perfect recipe :)

This recipe is fabulous! My husband wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday and I used this one...it was such a hit! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and poured the cake into a bundt pan sprayed with 'baker's joy'. After it was done I let it sit on the counter for about 1/2 hr before turning it over to place it on a decorative plate. I topped the cake with a double-batch of 'satiny chocolate glaze' from this site. This is definatly a keeper! I recommend this recipe to all!

Dense and rich chocolate cake.  It was a little oily, so next time I will cut back on the oil.  Will be making this again.  Update...I made this cake again but only used 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup nonfat milk and no chocolate chips (I don't like the chips in the way of the cake).  Cake was definitely not as dense but still very good, especially since it was not as oily.  I suggest cutting back on the oil and using the milk...that's how I'll be rolling with this one.  I also frosted the cake with whipped cream (so sugar added as the cake is sweet enough) and toasted chopped almonds on top...very good with the almonds (almond...buy raw in bulk from Costco and just chop and toast in a pan on low heat).

Like a lot of previous reviewers I thought this cake would be a shoo-in with all the rave reviews.  While it wasn't a terrible cake I thought it was quite bland and the only reason I finished my piece was because of the ice cream and Satiny Chocolate Glaze along with it.  Otherwise too boring to be worth the calories.

This was so easy to make. So easy. I changed nothing in this recipe. (For those of you who worry about the chocolate chips sinking in the batter, toss them with a little of the chocolate cake mix before adding it to the cake batter.)

Really chocolate-y. I frosted it with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting also from this site. Great for the Chocoholic that is my husband and the PMS Monster that lives inside me.

I will make this again, especially for those family gatherings that involve my husband's family. This is sure to impress even the most fierce food snobs!

Delicious!!I've made this for two parties and it came out great both times even though I forgot water the first time and the second time I used applesauce and half the oil and lite sour cream. I always use mini chocolate chips. Moist and chocolatey!Thanks for the recipe.

delicious and moist. Used devils food cake mix and choc. pudding and baked in 2-9" round cake tins.  I used the whole amount of oil the recipe calls for but will decrease to 3/4 cup next time around as the edges were a bit crisp. Yummy!!

Oh, yumm! This cake is fantastic.  I worried that it would be too rich but it was perfect.  I made the satiny chocolate glaze to poor over the top of it.  The whole family loved it.  Will be making this one again.

SOOOO GOOD! My husband (the chocolate-lover) said it was the best chocolate cake he's ever had! The ONLY thing I changed was that I used 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1 cup. Other than that, I followed the directions as stated. I topped it with the chocolate buttercream frosting found on this site. YUMMY!

I had really high hopes for this, and unfortuantely it didn't turn out the way I had thought it would.  If you are making this, make sure you do not over cook it, when you insert a toothpick in and it still has some stuck to the toothpick it is ready.  I let the toothpick come out dry and I think that is what made it not as good b/c it wasn't as moist as I thought it would be.  I hope that this helps the first time users so that they will enjoy it.

I made this for my family and now I find myself making this all the time.  My family has all requested this cake for their birthday cake (even my 10 year old daughter).  I add the satiny glaze (from this site).  Wow, what a terrific chocolate cake.  Thanks for sharing.

Holy god, it's so good. I made it on Friday for a church picnic Sunday and it held up great, though it was tempting! I was nervous about how long it sat in the pan, as cakes cook longer in their own heat if left in the pan out of the oven, but it turned out absolutely perfect. (I used 3/4 a cup of oil, and it was a little much. If I make it again, which I was requested to do, I'll go with .5 a cup.) It was rich and moist and was eaten in all of twenty minutes!

YUM.
I did change one thing though: instead of using chocolate chips, use chocolate CHUNKS. It creates these big gooey eyes-roll-back-in-your-head bites.
This is a really easy yummy cake-PERFECT for when you don't have alot of time and want to serve something just loaded in chocolate!!

After all the rave reviews I was disappointed in this cake.  It was just okay.  I have better chocolate cake recipes.  Peanut butter frosting helped...but peanut butter frosting makes anything taste good.

This is easy and great. It is not too sweet. I used the mini-chocolate chips which I like. I also used 1/4 C milk and 3/4 C oil. I make these as mini-bundt cup cakes (17 min.) and they are wonderful. All my friends love them. The other great thing is that they freeze really well. I froze them and just took out one or two as I wanted them and they lasted for quite a long time. The recipe made about 36 mini-bundts.

I followed the recipe as is w/ the exception of using sugar free pudding because that is what i had on hand. Everyone loved it. I did put cream cheese frosting in the middle as an extra bonus. Will definately make again!

This is rich, dense, moist and absolutely fabulous!  I like to use the Dark Chocolate Fudge Cake mix, to make it a little extra decadant!  My husband requests this cake all the time!  I have made it for several pot luck type parties, and it never fails to be completely consumed and everyone wants the recipe!

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST CAKE! I have made this cake three times in the last month and it is always a hit. I would suggest lowering the temperature and cooking for a little bit longer so that the outside isn't crunchy. I topped with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site and decorated the outside and center with chocolate covered strawberries.

I thought this cake was delicious!  Unfortunately, I didn't have all that the recipe asked for, so I had to improvise.  I used 2 boxes of sugar-free instant chocolate pudding (quite good)instead of the regular pudding mix.  I also didn't have quite enough chocolate chips, so I topped it off with pecans.  Oh yes, I also did the 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk...tried to cut some calories.  End results.....DEElicious!!!!

This is the best homemade chocolate cake I have ever had. I made this for a dinner party at my parents friends house that I was carted along to. The cake, and me, were praised all the way through dessert (the family are humongous chocolate fans). Because I was serving it to 6 people and I didn't feel like cutting the cake, I made the recipe like normal and baked the batter in individual small bundt cake pans. I think there were eight large serving cakes in total when all the batter was gone. I adorned the top with raspberries and then dumped a lot of raspberry syrup on them. Yum, just the memory of these makes me hungry!

Excellent cake!  I made it for my office as a test for another event and they loved it!  One person suggested buying an oven for the office. =)  I used chocolate fudge cake mix and mini chocolate chips.  Fantastic!!  The mini chips really up the gooey factor.  DH thought the cake was a little oily, but I didn't want to change a good thing before the real event.  Next time I'll try half oil and half milk.  I'm also going to try the mint variation and the peanut butter variation.  Oh, and I dusted it with powdered sugar only.  Anything more and it would be too sweet.  Thanks!

I really wanted to like this more, but it was just okay.  The cake was very dense and just needed something.  If I ever make this again, I would definitely pour some type of glaze over it as it is really boring without.

I made this recipe for a Father's Day get together thinking that you can never have "too much" chocolate in a chocolate cake.  I fully expected to bemoan the lack of chocolate icing, but lo and behold, YOU DON'T NEED IT!  I made the recipe exactly as written (Devil's food and chocolate pudding mix, exact measurements, no low fat/sugar substitutes) except I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of regular since that's what I had on hand.   It baked for exactly fifty minutes and I dusted it with powdered sugar once it had completely cooled.  The cake was fantastically moist and the chocolate chips were soft and almost melty, even the next day!  My boyfriend summed it up nicely when he said that it tasted like the icing was INSIDE the cake, so there was no need for icing on the outside.  So good!  No one will know it wasn't made from scratch.

After reading all the rave reviews, I decided I had to try this recpe.  I followed the instructions exactly.  I honestly do not know why it got so many great reviews! It was just okay! Nothing special.  I do not think I will make this again.  Just very average.

Won second place in a bakeoff. This is the richest cake I've ever seen. Keep it chilled before serving! It melted heavily at a Texas BBQ.

Wonderful, delectable & delicious! This is hands down the best chocolate cake I've ever made! It was so moist and rich- just was too good! I followed the recipe exactly, didn't change a thing, and it was complete perfection, plus easy to make to boot! Thanks for a wonderful recipe that will be a standard in our home!

Oh boy this is good, and just so easy you won't believe it.  I have made it using banana pudding mix, and it works really well.  Don't make this unless you have cold milk in the refrigerator.

This was great! Very rich!!! I used the satiny chocolate glaze which was very good but a little too much. I think next time I will use something lighter or nothing at all. It would be great all by itself.

The first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly. It turned out very moist, slightly crisp on the edges, and I topped it with a dusting of powder sugar. The family loved it but I thought it was a bit too much oil. I did use the mini chocolate chips and it was definitely moist to the last bite.

Taking the suggestions of other reviewers, I modified the recipe for my mother's 60th birthday. I used a Chocolate Fudge cake mix, Chocolate Mint pudding mix, 1/2 teaspoon of mint extract (probably didn't need it but chocolate mint is my mom's favorite), and Ande's mint baking chips. I used a chocolate ganache type recipe - using melted butter, 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, and 1.5 cups of confectioner's sugar- again adding 1/2 teaspoon of mint extract- the cake turned out wonderful and she loved it. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again- and experimenting with different combinations.

This was very good, I tried Oreo pudding in place of chocolate and it turned out well. I also frosted it with the Satiny chocolate glaze that was mentioned here. The glaze got a bit hard by the next day, even in a sealed container, but it still tasted good.

I made these into cupcakes. I didn't have any sourcream so I added about 1/2 cup of mayonaise. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting and they were great. I used regular sized chocolate chips but chopped them up.

I've been making cakes for 35 years and sorry, I can only give this 2 stars, if that.  My cake turned out so dry that I had to double the glaze (Satiny Chocolate on this site) on top AND add ice cream and whipped cream just to make it edible.  The batter was incredibly thick, not like cake batter at all.  Followed the recipe exactly...not good.

Let's just put it this way...I'm getting ready to bake my 3rd one in less than a week! The second one I used german chocolate cake mix, and iced it with coconut pecan icing. Well, it wasn't the most attractive cake with that icing on it, but it tasted absolutely amazing! So not only is the original version SO delicious, but variations work just as well! This recipe is superb. The cake stays so moist and flavorful. I plan on making lots of variations of this in the future.

Outstanding, rave reviews on it.  Used mini-chocolate chips.  I cooked it in a bundt and a 9 x 13 for 60-75 minutes on 335 for two cakes at once.  I also used unsweetened applesauce to replace half of the oil.

I thought this was too easy to be as great as the reviews said it was, and unfortunately it was a let down.  It was pretty good, but still tasted like a boxed cake mix to me.  I will try a different recipe next time.

The only bad thing about this cake is waiting for it to cool! OK, I admit, that didn't stop me either! It smells wonderful baking and tastes even better. I made it as directed with mini chocolate chips and glazed with the chocolate glaze from this site. I garnished with chocolate curls. Don't stay home alone with this cake! Make sure you have someone to share it with--it will impress!

I guess cake mixes aren't my fortee..:P I got complaimts that the outer cake was too hard. Also, the inside seemed too moist, but I'm not grading down on that since I didn't have any. All I know is that it's not getting eaten. Well, thanks anyways.

This was good.  My husband loved it.  As for me... I'm not a huge fan of boxed cake mix recipes.  People seemed to love it though. So I'll probably make it again.

I have made 5 chocolate cake recipes this week trying to find the perfect one for my daughter's first birthday party.  This recipe is WONDERFUL!  Even my chocolate ambiguous husband loves it.  I made cupcakes using Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake mix, adjusted the temp down to 335 and watched them carefully for about 10-15 minutes. They came out simply great. The recipe was very quick and easy. I was a little surprised at how thick the batter seemed but my cake turned out great. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I left out the chips and made this recipe in two loaf pans, intending to freeze one loaf for later use since my household is only my husband and I.  We had company over and one loaf was gone immediately.  I sent my friends home with the other loaf b/c they kept raving about the cake and my friends don't bake [or cook for that matter!!!]  Thank you for a delicious recipe.

Wonderful. This is now my signature cake. Everyone loves it. I always serve it with the satin glaze listed on this site. It's so rich that it feeds a lot of people! Seriously, 16-18 servings. Make it 2 days before serving. It gets better, really moist. Add the glaze right before serving. Thank you for sharing this!

Delicious!!! Excellent and sooo very easy to make!!  Great to use other flavours of pudding and cake mix...used yoghurt left in the fridge instead of sour cream and is just as delicious and moist!

So good and easy!  We used devil's food cake mix, light sour cream, dark chocolate pudding, Hershey's special dark chips and wow was it flavorful and moist!  No leftovers on this one!  I think next time we'll try to make it a little healthier by using fat free sour cream and applesauce in place of the oil, or some of the oil, and see how it turns out.  Served it with cut strawberries on the side.  Mmmmmmm

I gave this three stars despite the rave reviews because the center of the cake just still mushy after 60mnts at 175 and another 30mnts at 150. The outside of the cake has burnt and it smells terrible and has slight bitter taste. I don't know what's the problem, maybe it was the instant pudding (i use local -indonesian- brand since jell-o choc pudding isn't available here). 
But it does hold it shape beautifully and easy to decorate.

This cake tasted very good.  Really  moist and tons of chocolate.  I don't know if I did something wrong or if everyone else had the same problem but my batter overflowed in the oven ( I used a bundt pan) and then one side caved in after it was turned out onto the cake plate.  I followed the recipe exactly so.... I will try again because it has great flavor, hopefully I will have better success.

I first tried this recipe a couple of weeks ago on a whim, and followed the directions exactly (my only variation was using mini chocolate chips following advice from another review).  Since then, this cake has been requested four times by family and friends, and each time it turns out just as wonderfully!  The cake comes out very rich and moist and is a real treat!

I made this for Easter (which was also my husband's birthday) and everyone loved it!  It does taste like a fudgie brownie, which everyone liked.  I used the satiny chocolate glaze and served with vanilla ice cream.  I will make this again, as requested by my family.

Amazing! I made this for Easter... it was so dense and moist and easy to make! I didn't make any changes in the recipe and it came out perfect, even at high altitude. I used a powdered sugar glaze for the frosting and it was delicious. Thanks for this recipe!

My kids loved this recipe, but it didn't really excite me too much.  The extra calories likely will keep me away from making this cake.  I made it with the Satiny chocolate Glaze from this site which was easy and very good on this cake.  I will wait for my kids to ask for it before making it.

The Best Chocolate Cake I've Ever Eaten! And I'm not a chocolate cake person. I used milk chocolate chips rather than semi sweet. I used regular size chips and had no problem with the cake. I sprinkled cake with powdered sugar and served with ice cream. The cake was a huge hit. I'll definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

okay...tried exactly as written and it is the best chocolate cake ever!!  Used the mini chocolate chips as another reviewer suggested.  My husband is a die-hard chocolate fan but very picky and he loves this.  I also tried in cupcake form...cooks for about 20-25 minutes and they are awesome.  I tried with White cake/vanilla pudding/SKOR bits with vanilla buttercream frosting...OMG!!  Yummy!!!  so moist and wonderful!  Thank you so much :)

very very yummy!
I used a mini bundt pan tray and cooked them at 350 degrees for 18 minutes.  I also used 1 cup of mini chips and 1 cup pureed raspberries in place of the 2 cups chips!  See photos!

This cake was good but a little dry. Cooking time in my oven should be around 45mins. My brother-in- law thought it needed icing but he's a real chocolate lover. I thought the powdered sugar worked well. I've already made this a second time so it's a keeper.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for except that I did two round cakes for a layered cake and I used mini chips instead of regular.  It turned out really good and was very moist.  We loved it.  However, it was not nearly as moist the following day, which was disappointing.  So while we all thought this was awesome the first day, we all definitely thought it was a "day of" cake.  I frosted it with the Chocolate Frosting I and found the same results.  It was good the day I made it, but the frosting got hard the following day.  I definitely wouldn't use the frosting again, but would make the cake again.  I would just serve the cake only the day it is baked.

Just awesome. 
I just tried this recipe, I wanted to see if it would work in cake pans for a stacked cake I am making for my son's birthday, and it is fabulous. I made a couple of substitutions, milk for the water, mini chocolate chips, and I added a teaspoon of vanilla, but honestly it's awesome without that. It worked very well in 2 eight inch by 3 inch cake pans, and the dense texture was great for a stacked cake. 
Thank you!

Hey,
This recipe is fantastic!!!! You should definitely try it.  I prepared a cake thinking that we'd have cake to eat for a week. Let me tell you that in two days it was gone.  It's a nice part for a party or a brunch.

Wonderful and easy recipe!  I had to make adjustments because of what I had on hand but it still turned out tasty.  I only had cheesecake pudding on hand so I used that instead of the chocolate pudding, I had mini chocolate chips but only had one cup so I made do with that amount, the cake was moist, not overly chocolate flavored because of the cheesecake pudding and the mini chips were found throughout the bundt cake, probably because they're lighter in weight than the regular sized chips.  I used the Chocolate Ganache recipe from this website and used orange extract to flavor it, the cake disappeared in minutes.  Thank you for sharing this receipe, it's awesome!!!!

In three words: good, easy, moist! I didn't have sour cream so I substituted with one cup of buttermilk, which worked just fine. (Normally you're supposed to use 3/4 c of buttermilk and 1/3 c of melted butter to substitute 1 c sour cream, but I figured there was already enough fat in this recipe.) I used 1 c of mini chocolate chips. Keep a close eye on this cake while it's baking. I checked it when I first smelled it, but it was too soon. At 50 minutes though, it had already started to burn a little. Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews! Good cake!

Make as directed and then microwave a can of frosting in the microwave.  Drizzle cake with frosting.  This cake truly tastes better the day after you make it.  Thank you... never been disappointed with this recipe.

Very good chocolate cake.  I stuck to the recipe except I used regular chocolate chips and put them in my mini food processor to grind them up.  This made the distribution of the chocolate wonderful!

While this cake is tasty, it lacks "spunk."  If you do not mind the taste that cake mix tends to bring into a dessert, then you will probably enjoy this cake more.  I must admit that I agree with some of the other reviewers when they say that it's merely a chocolate cake, nothing special.  I'm glad that I tried it, and it definitely will not go to waste.

I made exactly as directed and it turned out great. I love how the chocolate chips in the cake kept their shape.  I added the "Satiny glaze" as others had mentioned and it really added a pretty visual finish to the cake.  I decorated with strawberrys and sprinkled with powered sugar. Lots of compliments.

Had to post. I made this a few days ago. Instead of reg sized chocolate chips, used mini as one reviewer suggested. Also made the satiny glaze. This is the best tasting chocolate cake I’ve ever had! Between myself my husband & the kids, we absolutely devoured it!
A keeper & I will definitely pass it on. Plan to make another this week (valentines day is around the corner, that’s my excuse!) and taking it to a camping trip…yumm-yumm!

This has been my favorite chocolate cake recipe for years. I've made it my own by substituting for the water: 1/4 cup kaluha plus 1/4 cup vodka with 2 teaspoons instant coffee dissolved in the liquid. The intensified flavor is TDF.

This is a chocolate lover's dream!!  It is so good and VERY CHOCOLATEY!!  We are huge chocolate fans, so, instead of powdered sugar I poured the "satiny chocolate glaze" from this site over it (yum!).  Next time my husband requested a peanut butter glaze.

This recipe is absolutely heavenly. I have made two variations now, based on another reviewer.   Very Moist and Chocolatey, without being overly sweet. My whole family loved it. I'm going to keep experiementing with this easy, delicious and versatile recipe.   Update: The original was my favorite until I experimented a little, coming up with a few personal favorites: I used white chocolate chips and put strawberry pie filling in the bundt pan before filling with cake mix. I topped the cake with rest of the strawberry filling and sifted some powdered sugar over it. Very pretty. More importantly, delicious.  Don't be afraid to play with this cake recipe. No matter what I do with it, everybody loves it. I've tried different flavored "chips", different puddings.. it all works. Next, I'm thinking of adding small caramel chunks to the cake mix and topping with dark chocolate slivers.   Like I said, endless possibilities.

This is absolutely the best cake I have ever tried! I made it for my grandpa's birthday and it was so good. I made it healthier by using some olive oil in the place of vegetable oil.

Wow!  This is so simple and foolproof that it is a great cake for kids to make.  I only had a half a cup of sour cream, but had about 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese.  Worked great!

This cake was just okay.  I think with this recipe you should use the smaller box of pudding rather than the larger one it calls for, just to much batter and a little difficult to deal with.  Also, it's just a cake, no icing or anything comes with it, you just decide for yourself what you want on it.  A little boring.  I made it for thanks giving and only 3 people ate it.

Best cake ever!!!!  Followed the recipe exactly for ingredients.  I started baking this at 350 in a dark non-stick bundt pan but it began to look like the edges were getting done too fast so I turned the oven down to 325 baked it a little longer then the recipe called for and it came out perfect.

We LOVED this  cake!!!  I took anothers reviewers advice and added peanut butter chips.  I also used chocolate frosting from a can. I heated the frosting on 50% power for about 18 seconds, poured frosting over cake. I melted some peanut butter chips, added a little milk to make a glaze and drizzled over the chocolate frosting. I topped it off by cutting up Reeses cups for garnish on top of cake.  Will definitely make this again!!

Oh my goodness!  This cake is so cool!  This is the first time I made a bunt that just plopped right out of the pan.  It might be the huge amount of oil in the cake.  Don't cut down on the oil, it's unsaturated fat.  I don't know what people are talking about with the outside getting crunchy.  I left it in the greasy pan over night to cool, and it turned out really nice, cooked perfectly.  Definitely bake it the full 55 minutes.  Some chocolate chips that were on top stuck to the bottom of the pan, but those just made a special preview of the cake for me.  Thy didn't sink, they just were on the top when I poured the batter in the pan.  The batter is too thick for the chips to sink, so don't worry about using mini-chocolate chips.  If you like or have big ones, use them.  I haven't eaten the cake yet, but the extra batter in the bowl was so good, it was like eating cookie dough, pudding, and cake batter all in one.

This cake deserves all the accolades it has received from previous reviewers. My 10 year old daughter took one bite and declared it to be "her cake" which means she wants it made for all her special occasions. It's really that good. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was just OK for me. I don't see what the big deal about it is. It tasted just like regular chocolate cake. 
I don't think i would use this recipe again in place of a regular chocolate cake mix.

This cake was just "okay," in my opinion...tasted pretty good, very chocolately, good consistency, but lacking a little in sweetness and flavor. Without the addition of the chocolate chips in the batter to sweeten it up and moisten the cake, it would have been thumbs down for me. Even with all of the other ingredients, it definitely had that boxed-cake flavor (which is fine if that's what you're anticipating!) in the end and not what I was expecting based on the reviews. Even so, everyone gobbled it up and it was a hit for the most part. Just a note - this cake definitely doesn't need a full cup of oil! I decided to save some fat and calories and use half of that, which is plenty - I also substituted 3/4 cup of *very* strong coffee in place of the 1/2 cup of water and it worked out well, giving a little more of a flavor dimension than water alone. Thank you for the recipe - a good base that I might try to jazz up in the future with some other more interesting ingredients. :-)

I made this for a dinner we were invited to. My husband overheard the host telling someone else that this cake "was to die for." It was really moist and chocolaty.

I used a small box of pudding instead of the large, I used about 3/4 cup of oil, and I used less than half the chocolate chips it called for. The cake mix I used said it had pudding in the mix. The batter was really thick and I wasn't sure   how long to mix it. I used a whisk and stirred till everything was mixed. I had no need to worry about the batter because the cake turned out great. It reminded me of the chocolate muffins that my sister would get from a bakery.

This was really easy and quick to make. It was as easy as doing a cake mix and it didn't need frosting, just a sprinkling of powdered sugar. I would make this again.

Great recipe, although it's really not a cake.  It's a giant chocolate muffin.  You know those huge chocolate muffins you get at Sam's Club?  This is it, except waaaaaayy better, more dense, very rich.  I made a chocolate glaze which made this cake ridiculous  :) ---- It was GONE in a flash!!

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had! It was gone in a flash and everyone wanted the recipe. I also used fat free pudding mix, fat free sour cream and cut half the oil with apple sauce and no one knew any different. It was so delicious! Made it with the satiny chocolate glaze and topped with fresh strawberries. A big hit! I will be making this one again in the future.

Let me add one more 5 star rating to the list!!!  This was an awesome cake that tasted like it took a long time to make, but really it was SO easy.  I will make this cake again and again!  I did add a chocolate glaze to the top instead of the powdered sugar, but I am sure it is good either way.  I recommend that you try this cake!!!!

OMG this was great! I couldn't give it 5 stars because I altered it a bit. I made cupcakes with this recipe and cooked them at 350 for 20-22 mins. I decreased the oil to 1/2c and added 1/2c milk, in addition to the 1/2 H2O. I also used low fat sour cream, and 2c. of the "mini" semi-sweet choc chips. I used a no-name brand devil's food cake mix and Jello choc pudding mix, you can really taste the pudding! It's like eating a whole pan of brownies in one cupcake! YUM... I had to laugh at the directions when it said "pour" batter into pan - there is no "pouring" of this batter, I had to spoon it out (I was doubting myself for not adding a little more oil, but it turned out great with out the extra)...It was also a little tricky to poke 'em with a toothpick cuz I kept hitting chocolate chips!
ETA: When I frist tried the cupcakes without icing, I thought it wouldn't need it. But then I used the Satiny Choc Icing (from this site) and it was PERFECT! I think I will make these as "mini" cupcakes in the future because it really is almost TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE - if there IS such a thing!

Excellent and easy!  I used fat free sour cream and slightly less than 2 boxes of  fat-free/sugar-free pudding mix.  My father-in-law, who is hard to please, really loved it!

WOW.  This was incredible!  Denise, why on earth did you only submit this to a county fair - send this baby to a national competition!  :)  I topped this cake with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site as another reviewer suggested.

This was GREAT. I made it for my boyfriends birthday and it sealed the deal. I substituted eggbeaters for the eggs, used light sour cream, and used applesauce for half of the butter to make it a little healthier. I also substituted espresso for the water. The cake was super moist and very yummy, not to mention EASY. I frosted it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.

Very easy to make.  Comes out very moist.  Was hesitant to make this at 1st since it is very similar to the chocolate cavity maker cake recipe from this site.  This cake is 10 times better.  Much better flavor and much moister.

i made this cake yesterday. from reading the reviews, i thought it'd be pretty chocolately, but after tasting it with just the powdered sugar, i thought it could be even more decadent. i'm going to frost the remaining cake with fudge frosting to make it suit my EXTREME sweet tooth even more. the cake is moist and very simple to make. i will try the variations, chocolate cherry, chocolate peanut butter, YUM!

I thought I had found the best chocolate cake recipe last year, but this year my daughter wanted something different.  This has got to be the moistest chocolate cake I have ever had.  My daughter said there wasn't enough chocolate so I frosted it with Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting from this site, now talk about chocolate overload.  It was the best combination.

This is perfect. Some people said it's still good w/ only 1/2 the oil, but it's really not. It definitely needs the full 1 cup of oil otherwise it will not be moist enough.

OMG my family went crazy over this cake!  I made it for my husband's birthday and baked it in a springform pan but it came out perfect.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but mine was dense.  It's sooo chocolatey and delish!  OH, I added a bit of coffee flavored liquor to the mix which made it really nice.

I can see why this cake won an award!  It was so great.  I made it for a going away party and everyone loved it and wanted seconds.  Everything about it was great.  I normally love frosting but this cake didn't need it at all.  I just sprinkled it with powdered sugar and it was fantastic.  It was so incredibly easy to make and I will definitely be making it again!

I made this for a friend's birthday and she loved it! I omitted the chocolate chips (on account I didn't have any) but it was wonderful anyway. I paired this cake with the Fluffy White Filling and Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website.  My friend said it tasted like a giant Little Debbie cake!

Delicious cake!  It's so dense and rich that it really doesn't need frosting.  I sprinkled mine with powdered sugar and garnished with strawberries.

I might try baking this in round cake pans like some of the other reviewers suggested.  Perfect with a garnish of whipped cream!

Excellent. Comes out perfect everytime.  Very moist and very rich.  No need for icing, a simple dusting with powdered sugar dresses it up nicely.  Otherwise this is so easy and taste spectacular.

This is so good!  My family ate it in one day.  I used yellow cake mix and 1 and 1/2 cups of chocolate chips because I thought it would be better if it was less chocolate and it turned out great!  I will make this cake over and over.  It is so moist and good.

Made this on Christmas Eve-doubled the recommended sauce and served w/ french vanilla ice cream...young and older (myself included) loved this recipe. I meant to cut back on the oil like recommendations and forgot...it was moist, crisp outside, used beautiful William Sonoma Bundt pan and it was a cnter piece.  It was easy, fool proof and chocolatey goodness!  Thanks for all the tips I'm making again tonight...New Year's Eve.

This is an amazing cake.  I used 3/4 cup of oil and used light sour cream to lower the fat a bit.  It was SO good!  One really doesn't need icing for this it's so good!  My Grandmother couldn't believe it used a cake mix!  Best chocolate cake I've ever had!

This cake is incredibly moist and truly satisfies those chocolate cravings!  I only had mini chocolate chips and these worked out well - every bite had a bunch.  I also lessened the oil to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup milk instead.  Very easy to make with little clean up - makes the house smell devine!  I think we just found a new family favorite!

Excellent! The cake was very moist and the chocolate goes on forever! It was a very thick. I would like it to be a little less thick, but If I can't have it that way, I would still make it again. It reminded me of a professional cake. I did have to bake it for an additonal 8 minutes. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

This was excellent. I made it for my brother-in-law for his birthday- it was a total hit! He is a chocoholic and absolutely loved it- my whole family did. Some of the guests thought I bought it at a cake store- it was that good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did have to add a 1/2 cup milk like one other person noted because my batter was extremely thick! This was great. I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this website and it turned out wonderful.

I can't wait to make it for my husband who missed the birthday party!

This recipe is now the one I use for a basic chocolate cake.  It was super-moist and flavorful.  I have to say....I omitted the chocolate chips and I did use frosting (Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting - found on this site).  Kept the cake in the fridge, and it was even better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!   Note:  You will need a really large bowl to mix the batter in.

I had been waiting for an occasion to make this cake and used it for cupcakes for a baby shower.  Yum! It was as good as everyone said it was and easy also. I made no changes and it made about 30 cupcakes. I did use the mini chocolate chips which was a very good choice. Little bursts of chocolate throughout the cupcake. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and tried it with a french vanilla cake and french vanilla pudding. On this one I didn't add any chips. It was delicious also. The only change I added to that version was to add extra vanilla, just due to personal preference. I highly recommend this recipe and will use again with other variations.

Delicious and so easy.   I only got one piece because my 15 year old loved it so much he at it all in 2 days.  He has requested this to be his yearly birthday cake.  I melted a tube of choc. frosting in microwave for about 20-30 seconds, then poured it over the top.

definitely one of the easiest and best recipes out there that pack a "SERIOUS" chocolate punch without compromising on flavor.  I subbed the water for hot coffee and sprinkled in 2 tbsps of Hersheys dark cocoa powder  for even more chocolately-ness.

This cake is just amazing. The recipe is a classic - I told my friend what was in it and she said it’s the one her grandmother used to make every year. And for good reason: it’s incredible. So much chocolate flavor! And it makes a ton. It feeds 12 people easily, and the leftovers are great frozen or heated in a mug in the microwave topped with a bit of vanilla ice cream.

We made it and it is wonderful. So dense and creamy.  The melted chocolate that we melted for pouring over the cake seized up, so you have to be very careful when it gets to the correct temp and work with it quickly before that happens.

I have made this cake twice and both times it was a hit.  It is loved by chocoholics and morning coffee lovers.  It is very moist just don't over cook it.   Will add to the rotation of desserts.

Make this with Spice Cake mix instead of Devil's food cake mix. Trust me, my family has been making it this way for the past 30 years or so and it gets rave reviews.

So far so good, wanted to ensure I marked it as made, but it is still in the oven. Followed all instructions and ingredients (listened to reviewer who stated “put the full cup of oil, it’s cake”. As in it’s not diet food so might as well make it full fat!)

I'm not surprised this has won prizes because it is probably the best doctored cake mix ever. I made this twice now for some coworker's birthdays, and people still stop by my desk and ask me to bring it in again.  I even keep a package of devils food cake mix in the kitchen at all times in case I need to whip it up for an unexpected event!

The best chocolate cake ever.  Very moist.  The recipe is easily adaptable to other flavors.  Just made a lemon version, using lemon cake mix and lemon pudding, and it was delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly.   It was delicious, but a little too sweet for me.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I plan to cut back slightly on a few of the ingredients.

I’ve made this cake a least a dozen times and it’s always a hit (even for those that don’t typically like chocolate cake!)

Only change I make is replacing the 1/2 cup of warm water with 1/2 cup of brewed strong coffee.  Seems to bring out the chocolate taste even more!

I used a 15.5 devils food cake mix and cut the oil down to 3/4 cup.  Used mini chocolate chips and baked it in a 9x13 pan and used it as my daughters birthday cake.  It turned out awesome!

I couldn't find this size box of cake mix anywhere  only could find 15.25 oz size. Took the recommendation of another reviewer to lessen the amount of oil, water, and eggs. Hoping it turns out just as good.

I love this recipe... made it as written,  it was easy and delicious , definitely satisfied the chocolate craving! Have since tried it using different cake mixes, puddings, subbing Greek yogurt for the sour cream and different oil blends, it always turns out great! Thank you for sharing such tasty recipe with endless possibilities!

Last year I made this cake for my granddaughter's birthday.  When I asked what cake she wanted this year she said "the same as last year.  It's the best".  Needless to say that is what I made and again it was a big hit.  Both times I added a chocolate ganache which added to the festive look of the cake as well as the chocolate flavour.

All of my family likes this cake so much. Every time I take it anywhere, I get asked for the recipe. It freezes well too. My husband and I both think it is even more moist and better (if possible) after frozen and thawed. Thanks for the recipe.

This is A definite keeper recipe. As another review were pointed out, boxed pudding and cake mix sizes have changed since this was originally posted. I had to use one cake mix which was actually closer to 15 1/2 ounces and two small boxes of pudding mix. Other than that I made it exactly as the ingredient called for. I did cook it in a rectangular dish instead of a Bundt pan but it still took about 50 minutes to cook because it is so dense.

My all time favorite chocolate cake!!!!!!! This cake is amazing! Everyone loves it . I don't make the frosting - I just dust it with powdered sugar. And its a great base for  other flavors - keep the ratio the same, just switch it up with for exaple a lemon cake mix and lemon pudding. Amazing every time!

I made this as 2 layers and then as cupcakes for two of my cousins for their birthday. The layers had a cream cheese frosting and then I made a peanut butter frosting for the cupcakes and all came out amazing! I did substitute the water with strong coffee and it was sooo yummy! I am keeping this recipe for sure.

OMG. This was good, exactly as posted. I thought perhaps it was not entirely baked in that amount of time, but upon tasting it, realized that it is tends more to a ''mousse'' style cake in a way........super moist texture. The only change I made was to add a handful of fresh pitted cherries as it is cherry season here. Yummm.

This cake is amazing!  The hubby is a serious chocolate lover, and he couldn't get enough of this.  I'm going to try it again with peanut butter chips instead of  semi-sweet chips next time.  Definite keeper!

I have been making this cake for years with slight changes only.  I reduce the oil to 3/4 cup and add 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.  The baking is where it got tricky, but with experimentation it comes out perfect every time.  Definitely use a well-greased bundt pan since it so dense it may not cook right otherwise.  I preheat the oven to 350 degrees, but ONLY bake it at that temperature for 30 minutes, reducing heat to 300 degrees and cooking 45 minutes more or until top is springy to the touch and a wooden skewer/toothpick inserted comes out clean.  Yes, it does need to cool for at least an hour and a half before inverting onto a plate.  Chilling it overnight is where I veer away from your typical chocolate cake.  My family feels it is best cold since the chips harden up a little again and makes it a unique treat!  I LOVE chocolate and eat frosting with a spoon, but just a sprinkle with powdered sugar is plenty and a pretty finish.

So easy. And consistent every time. My 4 year old and I make this cake together.  The only changes we made is substituting for Organics brand chocolate cake mix, Organic brand chocolate pudding, lily’s organic Dark semi chocolate and chips. We’re just trying to be “good.” But honestly the recipe as-is is great. I only substitute to feel good about eating the whole cake.

I made this for a potluck party and they were a big hit. I cut the oil in half and made 25 cupcakes instead of a big cake. They were done in 30 mins. Once the cupcakes were cooled, I topped each one with a fresh strawberry and then spooned melted dark chocolate on the strawberry and the top of the cupcake, then I dusted them lightly with powdered sugar.

There were issues. The cake crumbled coming out of the pan and was close to overdone after 40 minutes. Maybe you can’t use gluten free cake mix?

This is my go-to recipe and I use it any time I make a cake that I want to impress everyone with.  Here's a tip- sometimes I use a bit less oil or sour cream, or whichever liquid because my cake was caving in slightly on the sides. Just the slightest bit less and my cake came out perfectly. I also never add chocolate chips.  I'm not a fan of too-chocolatey.
Denise. You're a genius.

I made this cake exactly to the recipe, baked about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. Cake was awesome, I let the cake cool for about 2 hours and added a chocolate ganache on top. I warmed 8oz of heavy cream in a saucepan to a boil and poured over 8 oz semi sweet chocolate chips, stirred until well combined, let cool for about 10 minutes then poured over the cake.

I made this a second time using 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup of milk in place of 1 cup of oil.  It was really good, moist, perfect.  Topped it with a ganache glaze.

This cake is easy and delicious!  It is my son's favorite cake.  Has anyone tried to make it as a sheet cake?  If so, how long did it have to bake and how did it come out?

I followed the recipe exactly - very moist cake. A sprinkling of powdered sugar is all you need for the top,; I definitely would not mask this cake with a heavy frosting.

Very chocolately! Most of the family loved it. Served it with ice cream and chocolate glaze drizzled over the cake and ice cream. Will make again for an extreme chocolate lover.

It is not fair for me to rate this recipe as I don't love chocolate.  However, I do enjoy eating the frosted crumbs after this cake has been devoured by my family and friends.  First time, I made it as written.  The eaters of the cake LOVED IT!  Later,  I made just a few adjustments.  Subbed the 1/2 cup water with coffee.  Added 1/3 cup flour because I'm at high altitude.  Makes the cake stay risen. I'm have a cake business and this is the only recipe I use now. Rave reviews from all to whom I serve this cake.

Amazing. Just amazing. I make it in a bundt pan. Sometimes sprinkle powdered sugar on top or make a glaze. It’s seriously the richest chocolate cake. Moist and delicious. Don’t try to make it healthy. Just make it as is and indulge.

I made this a couple of weeks ago for my husband's birthday and everyone raved about how good it was.  I gave have to my daughter to take home and she said they were all sad when they finished it but my grandson's birthday will be here in another month and he has already requested it for his family celebration.     This recipe is a keeper.

Very rich! Everyone loved it! Topped it with chocolate ganache and strawberries. The Ganache was just equal parts semi sweet chocolate and heavy cream that was warmed in the microwave. 4 ounces of chocolate and 4 ounces of heavy cream would be enough. I made more so we could drizzle it on each slice.

This is the only chocolate cake recipe I use!  So easy and It always turns out perfect, no changes needed. I make a chocolate ganache from All Recipes (Gnache II) to drizzle on top. (I do prefer semisweet choc. Chips in the gnache instead of bittersweet)

This chocolate cake is perfect! Every time I make it everyone comment on how delicious it is. And I’m asked to bake it every time there is a celebration. I have only one problem that I haven’t mastered yet or don’t know why is happening. I take it out from the oven and my bundt looks perfect but as it is cooling it sinks in the center and don’t know how to fix it. When I turn the bundt it doesn’t matter as the bundt keeps its shape and it is not noticeable but it bothers me that it looks perfect but it sinks when cooling. Do you know why or what can I do? I follow the recipe exactly as is written. And only once I got it perfect. Thank you.

I was skeptical about using mixes, but this was a hit! I dusted it with confectioners sugar, and topped it with berries and it looked quite professional. This will be a repeat recipe for sure!

I don't understand those crazy people reviews how the cake is too sweet or not good cause it wasn't made from scratch this is the easy go-to most delicious cake ever it deserves more than 7 stars! I make this all the time for special occasions like Friday night it is so moist it occasionally needs a couple of extra minutes but who cares this is amazing

So yummy! My 10 year old made this all by herself last night and it came out perfect! She followed the directions exactly except substituting 1 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil. We topped the warm cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was divine. She is excited to try some of the other variations another reviewer mentioned. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Made this as a birthday treat...then mailed it from CA to NY and it arrived still moist and was well-loved. The person I was mailing it to loves hershey's chocolate, so I smashed up a bar of it in lieu of chocolate chips.

I made this cake and followed the directions as given and it was a hit in my family.  I never use cake box cake mix, I always make my own from scratch but I must say this recipe passed the test of times. It was rich and moist and just a good chocolate cake. I made a chocolate ganache to drizzle over it.   I definitely will be making this cake again, and it will be shared among family and friends and will  go in my recipe collections.

I made this for a dessert auction.  I filled the bundt hole with raspberries, stuck raspberries into the melted chocolate chip drizzle on top, dusted with powder sugar.  Called it Chocolate Raspberry Experience and it went for $75!    It's a very moist cake.

Followed the recipe exactly but made 24 cupcakes instead of a cake. Baked for 20 minutes but the buttoms were a little bit burnt so probably 15 is better. Still turned out delicious!

I following the recipe for the quantities but used sugar free pudding mix instead of the high sugar type.I used a bit more than one cup of chocolate ships ( Ghirardelli bitter sweet) instead of two full cups. I also added instant coffee to the water but I don't think it affected the flavor at all. I dusted the cake with powdered sugar cause I thought it would be enough chocolate without any glaze or frosting. I will definitely make this again. I baked it at 335 degrees and kept testing it. I live at over 7,200' elevation, so baking has to be adjusted for most things.

Hubby is not a chocoholic nor is he a fan of cake, but kept nibbling at this cake all evening! As with others, I compensated for the size of cake mix and pudding mix by decreasing all liquids and only using 3 eggs. I made two 9" round pans and used some chocolate glaze mixed with chopped sour cherries between the cakes, then put more glaze mixture on the top. Very,very good. I will be using this recipe again, maybe with other flavours of cake mixes, puddings and chips!

I found this recipe and decided to try it. It is my go to chocolate cake/cupcake recipe now! It is my absolute favorite. The cupcakes are moist, rich and delicious! For work, I’ve made cupcakes with this recipe and made a marshmallow buttercream frosting and they were a huge hit. I do not make any alterations. Perfect as is!!

I followed the healthier suggestion of substituting apple sauce, using only egg whites etc. It was very good!! I couldn't decide on a topping...so I melted dark chocolate chips and added 1 teaspoon of oil to them and drizzled/spread as a topping. Took it to work and it disappeared!!!

First of all I followed to the T. Not a fan of a lot of chocolate but this is Fabulous. It does not taste like something out of a box. I use the mini chocolate chips another reviewer suggested. Because it's only 2 of us left at home I will make something , get my husband opinion then off to work I take it and get co workers opinion. This is the Most requested cake.

YES. We cheat with a box cake mix. Who cares?  There is no better chocolate cake on the planet. The end result is divine. I don’t change anything about it. Chocolate ganache on top. I call it SMASH Cake because I want to smash my face into it!!

I've made this many times with a couple moderations. Instead of water, I add a half cup of strong coffee, like espresso. And I use 16 oz of sour cream and one third cup of oil. I also use three eggs. Consistently delicious.

I made this cake for a boss’ birthday. She couldn’t say enough good about it. Said it was my best chocolate cake so far. I wasn’t sure about sour cream in a recipe but this works. I will keep this recipe as my favorite chocolate cake. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us. I made absolutely no changes nor would I. It was perfect the way it is written.

My 9 year old made this on her own. It was that easy! We made this recipe exactly as written with no changes so we could accurately rate it. Everyone loved it! For us, the outside was sort of crispy but the inside was moist and amazing. I sprayed the pan with the Pam that has flour in it. Next time I might use mini chocolate chips. When we make this again (and we will!) I can imagine so many varieties to try! I think it is truly the perfect base recipe and will lend itself wonderfully to different varieties. Maybe a vanilla mix with caramel chips? Or chocolate with mint chips? Sooooo many options!

It was a hit! The cake was moist, and the occasional extra bite from a chocolate chip was a nice touch. I made it with a salted caramel icing drizzle.
My package sizes didn't match... my cake mix was 15.25 oz and my pudding mix was 3.9 oz. So I used .75 cups oil, 3 eggs and 1 heaping cup of chocolate chip cookies. It turned out great.

This cake was delicious.  I was skeptical about the instant pudding, but used it.  Have you ever had a cake that was crunchy on the outside and moist as can be on the inside?  Well, this is the cake.  I made the cake twice and everyone raved about it, then decided to make muffins with the same recipe and again everyone was going crazy over them.  They turned out as good as the cake.  You have to shorten the baking time though,

Followed directions as written EXCEPT the cake mixes are now only 15.1 ounces, so adjustments in quantities had to be made.

Used the satiny chocolate glaze over it.

A keeper.

This is a serious chocolate cake. Not for the faint of heart. Added chocolate ganache and it was awesome! Will definitely make again. Very simple to put together.

I made this cake last night for coffee hour today at church. I only made one small change, put chocolate chips in food chopper to make them smaller. After 50 minutes minutes it was done. Waited the necessary time to cool, it came out of the pan beautifully. Am making it again this week for a birthday but i thought it was a little bit dry. Any suggestions on how to make it more moist? In the picture, there is some type of frosting, what?

This. Cake. Is. Amazing. No joke. I followed the recipe exactly, and each time it has come out PERFECT. I have made it numerous times for gatherings, and people go crazy for it!! My 8 year old daughter is obsessed with this cake and actually requested it for her birthday party! i was thrilled to make it for her! It is the perfect amount of chocolate-y, so moist inside, and so amazing looking on the outside with a dusting of powdered sugar! I absolutely love love love this cake!

I have made it and LOVED how MOIST it was. Wanting to make today but would rather make in a regular cake pan. Does anyone know how that turns out or why one would need to make it in the bunt pan?

Made this for my chocolate addict boyfriend and he said hands down best chocolate cake ever! It's so simple to make, so moist and you would never know it was a box cake! He loves the peanut butter and chocolate combo so I have also made it with reeses peanut butter bits instead of chocolate chips and a peanut butter glaze. Yum!

Delicious chocolate cake for chocolate lovers. It is slightly denser than traditional cake since it is a bundt cake.  Don’t have a bundt pan? You can bake it in two 9 inch pans for 45 to 50 minutes.

The recipe calls for a cake mix that is 18.25 ounce. It never crossed my mind to check the weight.   I followed the suggestions and added 1/3 cup of milk but knew I couldn't add the water. That's when I checked to see why my mixture was wet enough. The box was 15.25 ozs. I added some mix from another cake I was making to get the right consistency. I made a cupcake 1st to taste and it needed something. I added moose in the middle and melted can frosting to pour on top. It tasted good and got great reviews from the family. The mini chips didn't melt, but folks liked the crunch. Please adapt this recipe for the new 15.25 oz box size.

I only didn’t give this 5 stars because I didn’t make it accurately. It wasn’t until I was making it that I realized my box of cake mix and pudding were smaller than the recipe requires. I thought I had just the standard size. I adjusted the additional ingredients to what I thought was appropriate for the lesser mix. I also attempted to adjust the cooking time for cupcakes instead of bundt cake... that sank a lot as soon as they cooled. So needless to say it was a failed execution. Regardless, it was so so tasty! We made our own frosting recipe as well, but it was incredible, and made up for the sinking cake!

Decadent is an understatement, but for the chocoholics, so unbelievably good. We dressed up with cut strawberries and dusted with powered sugar.
Amazing presentation and an amazing desert. This should be in all the finest restaurants.

I followed the main recipe and then mixed in 1/2 a bag of mini marshmallows.  After baking I topped it with the rest of the mini marshmallows and toasted them under the broiler to turn it into a Hot Chocolate Cake for a potluck at work

This is amazing! I usually don’t make cakes with a cake mix, but between the pudding mix and sour cream, this cake was wonderfully moist and chocolatey. The mini chocolate chips are a must. I made a simple powdered sugar and milk glaze to pour over the cake. Everyone loved it!

This cake really earns its stars-  It is so moist and chocolatey, it will satisfy even your most chocolate loving friends.  I have even had people tell me they don't normally even like chocolate cake but this one is amazing.  I made it both in the bundt pan and also as 2 9 inch pans (to do a layer cake) and both came out awesome.  Of course, I reduced the baking time to about 25 minutes with the 9-inch rounds.  This will be my go-to chocolate cake in the future!  Thanks for sharing!

It is super easy to make.  I replaced vegetable oil with coconut oil and everyone loved it.  I believe that if instead of using a cake mix you would use all the ingredients it would be even better!!

I made this for an event. The white bakery cake that the event organizers bought had a few slices taken out of it, while this chocolate cake disappeared!  Only thing missing was a cold glass of milk to go with it.

This is fabulous. 
It is a huge hit every time I serve it anywhere. It is also very versatile.  The only thing I change for the chocolate version is that I use espresso or Khahlua instead of water. It really deepens the chocolate flavor. I always top it with a chocolate ganache, and it is too yummy for words. 
I've also made different versions of it with other flavors of cake mix, like using lemon cake mix, adding homemade limoncello as the liquid and adding vanilla baking chips. I've used a butter pecan cake mix and added butterscotch chips, and replaced a tablespoon of the liquid with a good vanilla extract. It turned out very nicely. 
It's hard to beat a recipe that's this good and can be changed up to give so much variety. It's my go-to cake recipe now!

I followed the recipe exactly (with mini chocolate chips), and my kids loved it so much I had to make a second one later in the week.  Delicious!

Like a lot of other reviewers, I initially shied away from this recipe because of the box mix. But, I wanted something somewhat hassle free for a party and couldn’t deny all the great reviews, so I gave it a shot. Like some, I used a fudge cake mix instead of the angel food, but still used the chocolate pudding and a cup of mini chocolate chips. (Also cut the oil in half for a 1/2 c oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.) The cake rose beautifully and resulted in thick, dense, but also moist, cakes. I used a chocolate buttercream and raspberry preserve combo to sandwich between the two before frosting it with the rest of the chocolate butter cream, and these were a great compliment to the cake. Truly enjoyed all the flavors and textures together (definitely recommend the mini chocolate chips, but I’ll probably add 1.5-2 cups next time.) I also think next time that I’ll cut the cakes in half to create 4 layers and use the raspberry/buttercream to stack between, as it would lighten up this heavy cake some. Giving this a 4 instead of 5 because, like some reviewers pointed out, it IS a jazzed up box cake recipe (although a great one!) but I thought the flavors would be a little more explosive, given the reviews. But I’ll be making this again and also love it’s versatility. Definitely recommend!

Someone asked me to make a cake so I just looked up chocolate cake on here (everyone always loves chocolate cake right?) and this was the first recipe I saw. I was planning on making a round cake but didn’t realize I didn’t own cake pans until I had already bought all the ingredients for a buttercream frosting, so I had to frost the bundt cake, which turned out ok. I didn’t actually get to try this but everyone said it was great. I couldn’t find an 18oz box of cake, the ones I found were 15oz or so, so I reduced the oil and eggs and water like someone else suggested in the reviews. It still turned out a bit crispy on the outside but I don’t mind that and I guess the people who ate it didn’t either.

I barely got to taste it since it went so fast.  I used the highly rated ganache recipe as well.  Very easy to make and my mom said it brought her back to the chocolate cake she use to love when she was little.  Best complement ever!!!!

I used mini chips , one cup, ad 1/2 cup coffee in place of water.  I would use large chips ...I . think you'd get more of a " surprise" chocolate  .  I did use large muffin tins, turned them upside down to frost with satiny glaze.  They are much better at least one day later....they are too cake-like for my preference  with same day serving.  

The glaze was a negative..I ended up making it twice, liked the suggestio of taking the butter, syrup off the heat to add the chocolate....a much smoother presentation.  I saw the suggstion of Ghirardelli bits too late.  I would also use them for a richer texture and flavor.

This should be renamed "Never Too Much Chocolate" cake.  Easy to make, and got rave reviews from family and friends.  It's a very rich, dense, moist, deliciously chocolate cake.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Convection baked it in a stoneware  bundt pan.  Definately let it cool the full 1.5hrs.  Dusted it with confectioners sugar using a sifter.  I chose to put in the refrigerator, and served it cold/chilled.  This recipe is a keeper!

This turned out exactly as the picture and directions led me to believe it would! For those with lower heat ovens, make sure to heat your oven to a higher temperature to get the same effect.

Delicious! I took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it. I made a few changes recommended by someone else on this site and it turned out perfect.  I used 1/2 c  oil, 1/3 c milk, and baked at 335 for 55 min.  It doesn't really need the icing but the icing makes it look fancier.  I'll be making this again.

I cooked it as the recipe was listed.  I did use the small mini semi sweet chocolate chips. It seems like it requires a lot of oil but it works. It will be our go to favoriate cake for birthdays. It turned out beautiful and so very moist.

Fabulous!  It was almost TOO moist -- I may cut down a tiny bit on the oil next time.  But then again maybe not, because days afterward it was not dried out at all!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Not my favorite chocolate cake recipe (unaltered version), but pretty good! For those who have asked in other reviews, I have tried this as a bundt cake and as cupcakes. It is much better as a bundt cake! It dries out very badly as cupcakes and loses much of that rich flavor. I made these cupcakes with peanut butter frosting and you could barely taste ANY chocolate flavor. In a pinch, I may use this recipe again (for last-minute bundt cake needs), but I also have other chocolate cake recipes that seem to be enjoyed more by my family and friends!

I traditionally follow a recipe as written the first time around and then adjust to my family’s taste. But in this case, I simply wanted to bake a cake and clean out my pantry. (#shelftember) I used a German chocolate cake mix, a box of Oreo pudding mix, 1/2 cup of sour cream (it was all that I had in my fridge), 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 3/4 cup of oil (per others suggestion), 1/2 cup of coffee, 4 eggs, and some leftover Heath toffee bits and holiday chocolate chips. Again, forgive me, but I was simply trying to utilize what I had laying around but there’s no denying the results were fantastic! I didn’t change the ingredients enough that I think this is a poor review. It shows that this is a simple and flexible recipe that can be easily adjusted. I’m imagining toffee chips or mint chips instead of chocolate chips, folding in chopped cherries and using grenadine instead of water, yellow cake mix with vanilla pudding and white chips for my chocolate hating father, the possibilities are endless. Bon Appetit!

We loved the cake which, by the way, is exceptionally chocolatey. A word of caution: Make sure you have a large enough cake pan. This recipe yields a lot of cake! We used the mini-chocolate chips - not as many as called for - and were very pleased. [We typically reserve 5 stars for things made from scratch. This uses 2 off-the-shelf mixes. Otherwise it would have earned 5.]

I love this recipe! My husband is a chocolate lover, and this hits the spot every time. It's a crowd-pleaser with very little effort, so it saves me in a pinch. I usually top it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze. On occasion, I will drizzle the chocolate glaze and a simple white vanilla glaze to make it look extra special.

I'm by no means a master baker, but I've tried a lot of recipes and this is the best chocolate cake I ever made!!!

I followed the recipe exactly except the size of the boxed cake mix I used was a couple of ounces smaller.  I came out just fine. 

Topped it with a dark chocolate ganache. 

YUM YUM YUM!

I have made this cake twice for other people. The first time I made it as a bundt cake. I was told it was very good and very moist. The second time I made it as a 3 layered cake, I doubled the recipe, used one cup of white chocolate chips, one bar of Baker's German chocolate melted w/white chocolate and 2 cups of premium chocolate chips. Frosted it w/KitchMe's Creamy Chocolate Frosting,  which really made it "To Much Chocolate" lol. Was told that it was the most chocolatey and delicious cake they had ever had. This cake is now my go to chocolate cake. Thanks. Great job to both of you.

I made this cake following the exact recipe and it was decadent!  The only thing I had to change was the cake pan.  I didn't have a Bundt pan so I used 2 9" layer pans.  Such a moist and rich cake.  The family loved it! 
I would definitely make it again.  Thanks for posting this recipe Denise!

I've made this several times now and it is THE best chocolate cake ever.  It is rich, moist and easy to make.  I've made it as sheet cake without chocolate chips and frosted, with chocolate chips as a bundt cake, and even as a naked layer cake, depending on who it was made for. Personally I prefer it with only one cup of mini chocolate chips and 1 tsp. espresso powder, and chocolate ganache poured overthe top and served with a cup of coffee. Delicious!

This is the first review I've ever left on AllRecipes, in fact, I created an account just to leave one for it.  I first made this a few years ago while on the hunt for a cake recipe similar to the Great Wall of Chocolate from PF Chang's.  This cake is BETTER.  So rich, dense, and chocolaty.  This is a staple dessert for me now, and my family always requests it for parties & holiday dinners.  They call it "Julie's Brownie Cake."  Try it... you won't regret it!

This cake was amazing. The consistency of the batter was like silk. I used a Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix and then added about half the chocolate chips...but next time will go ahead and use the entire 2 cups of chips just because! I also substituted the powdered sugar topping for a can of fudgy icing that I heated for about 30 seconds in the microwave and then poured it over the top of the cake letting it dribble down the sides. My daughter-in-law called it "Never Too Much Chocolate Cake!"

This cake is so good that it doesn't need frosting (and that is said by someone who wants the corner piece of cake with the big flower on it to get as much frosting as possible!)  I was requested to make a birthday cake for someone who did not want frosting.  I made this cake, filled the center hole with chopped fresh strawberries and the top with pretty sliced strawberries.  I topped it all with powdered sugar and it looked very nice and he was thrilled!

I was given this same recipe by a friend 25 years ago. We know it as Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Cake. We learned a long time ago that slathering the outside of the cake with warm chocolate syrup while the cake is still warm keeps it moist for many days longer.

Substitute the water for Kahlua, use 2 cups of sour cream instead of 1 and you have a Chocolate Kahlua cake! I pour batter into greased bundt pan and bake @ 350 for 50 mins!

I love to bake but I am a semi-homemade baker..this cake recipe was right up my alley..it had a thick rich batter..used 1/2  cup oil and 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter..put 2 tablespons of instant coffee in the 1/2 cup of warm water..added 1 cup of grated zucchini..turned out so good..I have new neighbors and wanted to make them welcome..I used 2 alumium pans (5 1/2" x 7 3/4") plus it made an extra 8 muffins..would definitely make this recipe again..the baker that made it with the mint flavor would be something I would try also..thank you for posting this amazing recipe!

This cake is incredible. I also like to bake it in a loaf pan, spray it with cooking spray, then sprinkle cinnamon and sugar mixture like for toast  to line the pan, like you would to flour it. Then sprinkle more on top before baking. This makes an excellent version of the Starbucks Chocolate Cinnamon bread. No matter how I make this cake, everyone loves it.

This is the most wonderful fudgy moist chocolate cake I have ever made! Have not found any cake as moist and delicious as this one is.  I follow the recipe exactly and it always turns out beautifully every time.  My family loves it when I surprise them with this cake and it disappears so quickly!  Have made it 5 times already since finding this recipe approx. six or seven weeks ago!  It is our new favorite chocolate cake and it is extra pretty made in my fluted bundt pan.

Everyone loved it!  I followed the receipt except I used chocolate fudge cake mix instead of devils food and I used the mini chocolate chips as another person suggested, which worked really well to have little chocolatey bites throughout. Next time I may heat up some hot fudge sauce and pour it over the cake!
The second time I made it I heated up Mrs. Richardson’s dark chocolate syrup and put it over the cake.  It was amazing and people practically licked the plate. Will definitely continue to do this.

Definitely a wonderful chocolate cake and I am definitely making it again!

But I will use smaller chocolate chips next time following the suggestions of some of the reviewers. Because the chocolate chips sink at the bottom while baking, the top of the cake (after inverted for serving) gets all the chocolate chips. So most of the richness is there. This creates decadent experience there, but the bottom part tastes dry and boring. 


For me, ganache is a must for this cake. I made ganache with 2 cup of heavy milk just heated enough to start boiling dumped on to 2 cup of chocolate chips following one of the recipes from here, but this came too watery to pour on the cake to stick on the surface, and I needed to add quite a bit of chocolate chips before actually using. This measurement gives you a lot of ganache. If you are making it just for the cake, you can probably make enough with 1/2 heavy milk and 3/4 chocolate chips, plus 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract.

There is too much oil in this recipe. I’ve made it several times and it oozes oil. I think if you decrease the oil by 1/4 cup, it will be perfect. Otherwise, it’s delicious!

Delicious! Perfecto! Used lowfat vanilla greek yogurt instead of  sour cream, 1/2 applesauce  1/2 oil,,  3 eggs, 1/4c coffee, 1 cup mini choc chips.  Baked in 2 - 9" round pans at 330 for 40 minutes.  Frosted with ganache (1 cup heavy cream brought to boil, pour over 3/4 bag ghiradelli bittersweet chips - whisk), some ganache and some whipped cream between layers . Refrigerate. Really the best cake ever.

I followed the recipe precisely. My husband said it was the best chocolate cake ever. I usually make mine from scratch and of a healthy variety.  But I will do this one again for a special occasion. Very moist and super chocolate-y. And super easy.

This was amazing! My husband called it “Death by Chocolate”. I didn’t make any changes other than using a chocolate glaze instead of the powdered sugar. It was so pretty and professional looking. The bundt pan makes it perfect every time. Don’t cook it too long though- check it so you don’t burn it.

I made it as a double layer cake and frosted it with a light vanilla frosting. I don’t have a bundt pan so I halved it into two 9” pans and baked it for 30 mins. It turned out flat on top and baked perfectly! It’s dense and almost brownie like, the only thing I’d point out is that once placing them on top the weight slightly affected the the bottom layer but nothing too great. My 3 boys really liked it and said it went perfectly with a glass of milk. I agree. :)

Great cake!
After noticing my pudding box was 3.9oz and not as the recipes calls (5.9oz), I also halved the oil to 1/2 cp. In lieu of the water, I used 1/2 cp. whole milk. In lieu of the sour cream, I used same amount of whole milk yougurt and it turned out great. 
I completely omitted the extra chocolate chips and made a loose golden graham cereal/marshmallow mix for between the two layers.
The two 9" rounds cooked for about 35 minutes at 330.

I made it for my husband for Father’s Day and he loved it! He is a huge chocolate fan. I did the 1/2 oil and 1/3 cup milk because I was afraid it wouldn’t cook all the way through in my oven and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe and the tips!

Made this many times.  Always get requests for the recipe.  The only change I make is to use mini chocolate chips.  I prefer how they disperse through the batter.  Delicious!!

Did everything directly to the recipe! Added home made Carmel drizzle (brown sugar, vanilla and butter melted together) to add as an additional topping and drizzled it over the chocolate topping for an awesome color contrast! The salty sweet taste totally made this to die for!

Made as directed, except for standard cake mix is 15 oz not 18 oz...very good, moist, excellent cake crumble.  Used mini semi sweet chips like other reviewers and reduced to 1.5 cups.  Will be my go too for chocolate cake.

This was a delicious cake but didn’t like the chocolate chips they didn’t melt as well as I would have liked. Will make it again without adding them. I will also butter the pan instead of the spray which didn’t work that well.

I only made 1 slight change. I used mini Chocolate chips.  Turned out great. The smell in the house was amazing.  Easy to make. The toughest part was waiting for it to cool for an hour and a half before eating.

made it today, but instead of using a bundt pan, I used 2 round pans and decorate it with a butter chocolate frosting, it was ok but the frosting is a little too sweet. Next time, I'll use either the bundt pan or decorate it with a mouse frosting

This cake is delicious! I made it using 5.9 oz of Godiva chocolate pudding mix, and 1 c of Ghiradelli semi sweet chocolate chips. As others suggested I only added 1/2 c of oil and added 1/3 c of milk along with the warm water. It had a slight crisp outside and the inside was deliciously gooey while the cake was still a bit warm. Hopefully when it cools it will still stay gooey inside.

I followed others recommendations... using coffee instead of water and adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I made one cupcake to test cooking time and temp and so I could taste the finished product before bringing it to a party. I cooked it at 325 for 21 minutes. I used then remained

My store only had the 15.25 oz cake box, and the smaller pudding boxes (so I used 2).  Turned out great!  I replaced the water with coffee as some suggested, and topped it with the frosting recipe shown on the back of the powdered sugar bag.  No bundt pan but it worked well in two 9 inch pans baked for 35 minutes.

I made this cake for my sons birthday. Omg this cake was so rich n chocolatey. I will be making this cake for other events. Instead of powders sugar I heated about 1/3 can of fudge icing and drizzled over the top and sprinkled Heath toffee chips over this.

This was a hit at my house!! So yummy and lush - no need for any icing (my boys were skeptical about a chocolate cake with NO icing!) But oh so rich and decadent!! I was told to keep this one on file!!

I was so excited for this cake but was disappointed. The flavor is rich, and the texture is fine. But we all much prefer my from-scratch version.

Too dark for my taste, but the consistency is phenomenal!  I like it better with only 1 cup of the mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.

This cake is absolutely the best. It is so moist and decadent. If you like chocolate there is absolutely nothing that you wouldn’t like about this cake. Definitely a winner.

I followed the recipe exactly except for oven temperature adjustment because of my oven's temperaments.  While it was tasty and no one else could guess it was boxed (partly because I always bake from scratch) I could totally tell it was boxed. I will only ever make it again if I'm super duper lazy and want chocolate cake!

Hands down the best 'box' cake I've ever made.  I was unsure, because my cake mix and pudding package were smaller than what was called for - but that's all I had.  I just threw them in a bowl, I did do the 1/2 c oil & 1/3 c milk like the others did - and figured it wouldn't work out.  Well, I had to keep an eye on it for the last 5 min or so .... took it out, let it rest and it came out of the pan perfectly and it just melts in your mouth.

I LOVE this cake.  I make most cakes from scratch but this is a  keeper!  I have tried adjusting (that's just me) but  this original is the way to go.  I like the regular size choc. chips as I end up with little luscious bits in the cake.  My advice?  Make as directed and don't over-complicate. That after all is the reason for using a mix.  I just spray my pan, mix everything together and bake.   I only use pwd sugar for the frosting as I really want the cake to shine.   I do believe the difference in a very good cake and an awesome one is the baking time.  Don't overbake!  You want the moist, gooey, cake and a few minutes over will still be good but not as delicious.  Thanks Denise!

I really wanted to love this cake, because it's chocolate! Unfortunately, I made the cake as directed and it was dry. I was expecting moist , especially given the ton of oil and the sour cream that is added. I won't make this again.

Oh, chocolate goodness! There’s never such a thing as "Too Much Chocolate".  I wanted to take the oil down a notch, so I decided to try 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup coffee (brewed and cooled)... then I completely forgot to add the oil... oops!... But it ended up quite tasty anyway, despite the missing oil. Oh, I also put strawberries and whipped cream on the side, plus I made the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe, which was tasty... and next time I’ll plan on making a true chocolate ganache. Yummm!!

After all the great reviews, I was a little disappointed. It was good, and my guests liked it, but I was hoping for something a little more memorable. Since cake mixes no longer come in the size specified in the recipe, I added 4 T of flour as suggested online to compensate, so while  I'll probably make it again for my son's birthday, I'll leave that out and see if I like it better.

Made just as is but with mini chocolate chips, and as a double layer cake with straight up chocolate frosting, and it is the best cake ever.  The mini chips melted into the cake while baking, resulting in a rich chocolaty cake. The cake is even better on the second day, which makes this cake perfect for making ahead. The texture became more moist and rich,  and denser overnight.  Day 3 -- snuck a slice for breakfast before my kids woke up :-) Just as good and so good with coffee, ya know!

I made it tonight, my husband couldn’t wait for it to cool completely.  It was heavenly slightly warm with some vanilla ice cream on the side.  So moist. So chocolatety!  I didn’t use an icing it was sweet enough.   I used maybe a 1/4 cup coconut oil to finish the cup of  veg oil because I ran out.  I also used 1/2 cup less chocolate chips because that was all I had and it was way plenty. Everything else exactly by the originall recipe.  It was excellent!

This was okay, I followed the recipe exactly, except put a few less chocolate chips since I added a chocolate glaze on top.  It is more chocolaty and richer than the cake mix cake, but I've made several homemade chocolate cakes and they've been better.  And with not much more work.  I'm glad I tried it, though.

This cake is delicious! I served it at book group and my friends loved it.  It is very rich and decadent, and easy to make!  I did use the mini chocolate chips as several had suggested and I topped it with a chocolate glaze, then sprinkled more chips on top.  Thank you for the video! The ONLY reason I didn't give this a 5 is because it uses a cake and a pudding mix. Easier on the baker but guaranteed to have additives and processed foods.

Great recipe. Only change made was to use 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup oil. I also baked in 9x13 pan and used Satiny Chocolte Glaze from this site. Will definitely make again.

I've been making this cake for years as it's one of my family's favorite for a birthday cake! The only difference in my recipe is that mine calls for 1/2 cup vegetable oil - it turns out just fine! I then ice it with a fudge like topping - delicious!

This cake is the best chocolate cake I've ever made!   I highly recommend it.  Such a simple recipe.   I iced it with cream cheese icing and YUM!   Next time I may use butter cream icing :).   I have to say, it was even better the next day as I kept eating the leftover.  Very moist.  I followed the directions and didn't change a thing.

This was FABULOUS - used my Bundt pan sprayed well with Pam (did not flour the pan); no sticking.  Dusted it with a little powdered sugar.  Was very pretty and served it to my Bunco group.  Wanted to make a chocolate glaze but ran out of time.  Would definitely make again!

I just thought this was okay! I didn’t like that after eating a slice my hands were covered in oil. It has a nice flavor, but  seemed too oily. I followed the recipe exactly.

This cake is awesome! I did take the recommendations of others to cut the oil in half. It was still amazingly moist and delicious. I had rave reviews from family. Not a crumb was left after Thanksgiving.

Followed recipe as listed however I used a 12 oz bag of mini semi sweet chocolate chips to blend into the cake, whipped icing and powder sugar.

I did cut the oil in half, otherwise followed the recipe. It was very rich. I just topped it with a little powdered sugar and served it with ice cream. I made it a day ahead, but with the chocolate chips it would have probably been better slightly warm so the chips would be melted.

I made this for a Christmas party. I used creme de menthe baking pieces instead of chocolate chips , made a white chocolate glaze, and  added some frosting holly and berries. It looked very festive, a bit like a traditional plumb pudding, and tasted fantastic.  (It is also very good with plain chocolate chips.)

This cake is delicious! I will again say—if you alter the recipe, you really  should not rate it. This recipe is perfect. Using the oil in the recipe does not make it come out “crispy” as one reviewer said. It is a dense, chocolate, fidgey, moist piece of heaven. Everyone loves it and begs me to cook it often.

This was an amazing cake! So simple and so delicious. It seems fool proof. I followed the recipe as is, and baked at 350 for 55 minutes. The cake came out perfect in that time. I couldn’t wait and hour and a half for it to cool before dumping it, and it still turned out beautiful. However, it is difficult to add sprinkled sugar on it when it is warm. The sugar melts and does not give the dusted effect as easily. Otherwise amazing, and I was short on time. Excellent cake.

Made this cake for a large family dinner and it was a huge hit!  It was so delicious and moist!  Only change I made to the recipe was to use milk instead of water.  I also made a cream-cheese frosting for the cake that went great with it!

Best chocolate cake ever.  I made this for Thanksgiving and my family and guest loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  No changes needed for a perfect moist cake.

Very rich! I substituted half a cup of applesauce for half the oil and it was very moist.

This was a great cake and super easy to make .  I did not change anything.  I glazed the following day with the satiny glaze from this site as well.   Turned out really nice.   The 2nd day it tasted even better.  Everyone raved about it and should be noted that this is a very moist cake!

This thing is a huge success every time I make it! We eat gluten free, and even when this is made our way, gluten-eaters still love it! To make this gluten free, simply use a gluten-free cake mix. Pamela’s brand is good, and if your store has the special gf recipe, Betty Crocker is good, too. We use Jello brand pudding, and we always check the bag of chocolate chips to make sure they are gluten free. Nestle has worked for us, and a couple of other brands. To be safest, you can get these in the organic section where they are clearly marked. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this with a few minor changes - I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, cheesecake pudding and pie filling instead of the chocolate and mixed the chips with 1 cup of dark choc chips and 1 cup of white chocolate chips.  Also reduced oil to 3/4 cup.  It was a hit with everyone at the Thanksgiving table.  I'm sure it would have been just as good with the original recipe.  Happy Thanksgiving

Fantastic! This was so easy and so good. The best chocolate cake I have had. I topped it with chocolate ganache and sprinkled with chocolate candy bar pieces on top. Turned out beautiful and delicious. Will make this again!

This cake is easy, moist, and a hit whenever I make it.  Co-workers now request it for their birthdays.  I have used peanut butter chips in it instead of the chocolate chips just to be different.  I highly recommend the peanut butter frosting with cream cheese on it for an extra treat!

I made this cake last Sunday. The absolute best cake I have ever tasted. I am going to make it again this weekend, but I am using peanut butter icing and peanut butter chips on top. Yummy. If you like a lot of chocolate, this cake is for you. 5 stars PLUS!!!

This was moist and yummy.  I did make a ganache frosting that took it over the top, in a good way!  The only thing that was confusing to me was the boxed cake, all the cake mixes I found were only 15 or so ounces (less that what the recipe called for and the only instant pudding was in 3.9 ounce boxes ... so I improvised I used a box of Duncan Hines (less than the ounces called for and used about a box and 3/4 of another box of the pudding, I guess it worked out fine because the cake was delicious, I can see why you won first prize!

This is an amazing cake. I adjusted the recipe slightly based on reviews. I cut the oil in half and added half cup of apple sauce. The pudding I bought was only a 3.9 oz package. The cake came out great. It is super moist and decadent. I topped with a vanilla glaze. Picture perfect.

I made it in dark metal cake pans. I reduced the time to only 30 minutes. Also, I substituted real butter for oil. I used 1 cup + 3 tsp. of butter in lieu of the oil.  It was a hit. It was a four layer cake. One was butterscotch and one was chocolate. For the butterscotch, I used white Devil's Food Cake mix.

This is my go to chocolate vale recipe. It’s amazing!  I also just made a strawberry version and lemon version and stacked them with a strawberry jam and strawberry buttercream.  Topped it with candy for a 13 yr bday party.   I was told it’s the best cake I’ve made!  Don’t be afraid to change the flavors out!

This cake is amazing! I made one batch as a bundt cake and one as cupcakes. They were equally delicious. The only thing that isn't good is that I can't find a cake mix in the size the recitals calls for. I wish someone would post this same recipe but with regular cake box sizes.

Was delicious.  Cake mixes are much smaller now.  I added an additional 3 ounces of cake mix when I made this to reach the 18.25 ounces.

This cake is amazing. Seriously, I usually don't even like chocolate cake and this is my new favorite cake! I made this for my mom's birthday last week and I fell in love with the recipe. Wouldn't honestly change a thing because it came out perfect just by following the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Best and easiest chocolate cake recipe ever!  I used a convection oven and tested out 325F at 49 min, which caused crispy edges but the cake was delicious and moist.  Next attempt (with new oven) I plan to decrease temp on convection bake to 320 or 315 and cook longer.  So many compliments!  I am tempted to try the other options of cake mix and pudding, but this original is so amazing why bother.

This cake is awesome, although no cake mixes come in 18.25 oz in this area anymore. Love the chocolate so much trying it with lemon cake, lemon pudding and white choco chips. Hoping it's as delicious. Thank you

I followed the suggestions of others and cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/3 cup of milk.  Made this for a Christmas party and they could not stop eating it.

This is a five star recipe
 Although for the life of me, I can't figure out why anyone would want to frost it. Perfect just the way it is. Did like the raspberries on top though. Thanks for posting.

I made this exactly as written, except I opted out on any frosting or confectionary sugar (no need for the extra calories!).  It was moist and absolutely delicious!  Great with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on top.

To begin, this recipe is excellent as written. Thus, five stars. However, my family loved an idea surfaced in another review. We routinely use this recipe, but substitute a Chocolate Fudge Cake Mix AND peanut butter chips. Da bomb!!

Use ghiradelli MILK chocolate chips!! I've made once with semi-sweet and once with milk chocolate, and my taste-testers told me "it was better last time" (using the milk chocolate chips!) Great recipe!
(I also poured a chocolate gnash in top - milk chocolate chips + heavy cream)

This cake is the most delicious chocolate cake you will ever eat.  Moist and full of chocolate goodness.
I have been making it for years.  I always bake this cake when my grand kids have a bake sale.  The last bake sale a man paid $20.00 for this cake.  It is always the first to go.  The chocolate people in this family always ask for this cake at Birthdays.  Wonderful cake, easy to make !!   Thank you for posting !!!

Very good chocolate cake!  I made this today and didn't have choc instant pudding, so used instant vanilla pudding and added 1/4 c. of cocoa powder.  I also made an Avocado Chocolate Frosting.  Wow!  chocolate fix is now satisfied!

I've made this cake for 25 years or so. It was in a Southern Living  Annual Recipe book .   I've made it for ball teams, school gatherings, family gatherings, adult kids request for covered dish and many more. It is amazingly easy and rich.

Very easy and delicious. I made changes only because I bought incorrectly at the store but everyone at work said it was the best chocolate cake they ever had so I'll be making the same way from now on. I accidentally bought the 3.9 oz box of pudding, Betty Crocker cake mix (not the same size recipe asked for), only used 1/2 cup of chips and used only 3 eggs. Turned out amazing.

The most perfect chocolate cake ever to meet my tastebuds - moist, fudgey, in just the way that satisfies the most intense of chocolate cravings. I've made it probably dozens of times since discovering the recipe several years ago, and everyone always likes it.

Made it in a 9x13 baking pan instead of bundt and was just as delicious. Super moist. Quite different if kept at room temperature rather than in the fridge.

This cake is deliciously moist.  I was looking for an improvement on the regular boxed cake to use with a different homemade icing that my family loves. This recipe was perfect.  i used it to serve 65 people at a rehearsal dinner.

This cake is the bomb!  I took it to a potluck at church and got rave reviews from everyone that had a piece.  Most asked for the recipe!   Only change made was that I did substitute 1/2 of the oil for 1/2 a cup applesauce.  Yummers!   Good with a cup of coffee or tea!

The absolute best!! Sooo easy to make. Made one change. Did completely away with the oil and added 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce. Eliminated 1800 calories just like that. Trust me...you won't miss the oil.

This cake was rich and delicous.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  I used  applesauce instead of the oil and only  1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips to save some calories and it was still by far the moistest, chocolatiest slice of cake I've ever had.  I'll decrease the oil/applesauce and the chocolate chips next time to make it even lighter, since it's so rich and delicious you'll never misss it.  Thank you to the reviewer who reminded to use the large box of pudding since I almost used the small.  It was also a great reminder that the toothpick may not  come out clean due to the chocolate chips.

I followed the recipe exactly. This was a really good cake, my husband loved it. The picture shows a cake with icing on it but directs you to top it with powdered sugar, what's up with that? I made ganache and poured it over the top. Made all the difference and finished it right. Don't think I will use this recipe again.

Ok this is one of the better cakes I've made that isn't a cheesecake. Lots of people in my family request this cake on b-days or special occasions just recently I made this one for my mom  and as i was  cooking it  i accidentally misread the recipe and added in  1 cup of water instead of a half cup the good thing was I let it set and then  mixed in the water  and the cake turned out pretty good it was very spongy though.

Best chocolate cake I've ever had!! 10 times better than a store-bought cake. I made this for a birthday and everyone LOVED it. Perfect amount of chocolate in the cake.

I have no idea how someone can bake and rate a cake like this. Disaster from the start. 12 cup pan is not nearly large enough; thus, it poured over making a horrible mess and even a small fire in my oven.  I've cooked from recipes and have loved this site for many years. I think I'll stick with cooking rather than baking.

I added almost 3/4 cup of flour as all cake mixes I found were 15.25 oz instead of 18.25.  It came out okay and was very good.  It was moist and kept well for a few days.

Any chocolate lover's dream!!! Made this just as written with the exception of baking 10 minutes longer, as my toothpicks weren't coming out clean after 50-55 mins. This cake is delicious, moist, and fudgy! Thanks for the recipe!! :)

This cake is great.  I have made it 3 times and I don't change the recipe.  I don't use icing as it doesn't need it.  Just pop a slice in the microwave for 15 seconds! My sister on the other hand is adventurous and has used yellow cake with butterscotch morsels and chocolate with mint.  Both of those cakes were great, too!

This cake is extravagantly rich but always a crowd pleaser. I do routinely have to bake it for closer to 70 minutes to get it to cook all the way through. Keep a close eye on its "jiggliness". If it's looking loose, let it bake a bit longer.

EVERYONE loves this cake--they say "the best they ever had" A MUST for this is to make a ganesh--simple one with butter cream and chocolate chips EASY and pour it on each serving--this is the only choc cake I will ever make again----hate the fact that there is always some leftover and I can't resist the next day til it is gone :>:>

This is an amazing cake that all who tried it loved.   I did not change anything except used a dark chocolate cake mix.   We did not add icing -- don't think it's needed.   It's excellent served warm with a little vanilla ice cream.   Excellent!

I LOVE this recipe! It’s a hit every time I make it. This time, I made cupcakes. I decorated half with a buttercream frosting for a party. The other half I kept for my family. Heat up the cupcake for 10 seconds, and drizzle with chocolate syrup. It’s like lava cake. It’s my favorite way to eat it, and the only cake I enjoy. I personally like the recipe with a chocolate ganache or topping.. the buttercream made it all too sweet and sugary.. although others seemed to like. I guess I’m just a chocolate gal!

I combined 2 recipes i saw. This was the main recipe but i made it gluten free and added cherry pie filling. The gf cake mix wasn't quite 18.25 oz so i added a cup of gf bisquick mix and I didn't have sour cream so i made sour milk and added melted butter. I wasn't sure how it would turn out with the can of pie filling but it was delicious and moist! I added 2tsp of almond extract which added a nice background flavour. I only added one cup of chocolate chips because i thought it might be too sweet but it's not overly sweet. I think i would add more cherry filling but i think i would drain some of the sauce and just add more of the fruit. And possibly more almond extract.

This was so yummy and moist!  It was exactly what I was looking for when my 14-year-old said he wanted very chocolaty cake.  I used only 1 cup of chocolate chips after reading reviews that 2 cups was too much.  I used  milk chocolate Ghirardelli so only 1 cup still gave great flavor and left room to actually taste the delishes cake!  My only problem was I had to pluck the chips off the bottom of the two cake tins I used.  The chips sink!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party and it was a huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfectly chocolately, moist and delicious! The best part...super easy to make! I made it into a layered cake and added chocolate ganache on top. Next time, I might just add a little espresso powder to enhance the flavor, but otherwise, love this recipe! Thank you!

Everyone raved about this amazing cake! I heard rumbling in the background of how moist it was. I made sure too pre-grease my bundt cake pan (butter and flour), let it cool for an hour and the cake came out beautiful. I used a little less Canola oil instead of vegetable oil. 

Next time, I will use less chocolate chips. I used the Sanity Recipe. I made double the recipe only need the 1 it was way too much glaze.  

Overall, I will be using it again! It is a KEEPER!!

Thanks so much for the recipe post

I made it non-dairy by using non-dairy chips and pudding, and non-dairy sour cream made by Tofuti. Excellent also

I wasn't so sure about the sour cream in this cake. But it really was delicious. And I'm not really a fan of sour cream so it was good for me that it really didn't taste like it. Over all a delicious cake!

Made it exactly as stated and used ganache to top. Used mini chocolate chips as a garnish on the top. Looked great and tasted better! Moist, chocolatey; it was a hit with my co-workers! Will definitely make it again!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! The BF thought it was the best cake he had ever tasted. 
I did make some slight adjustments. 
The recipe calls for 1c of oil, thats a lot of oil! I switched the veg oil up and replaced with 1/2c of melted coconut oil and used a pudding pack for the other half of the liquid. I also used a skim milk sour cream. Delish and much healthier! :)

I've made this cake many times over the years and everyone always loves it, with one exception on the ingredients; instead of icing,  pour about 1/4 cup of Kahlua liqueur over the top at the end.  It gives it a great Texas flavor and  makes it even more moist.  Katie

This cake is so rich and delicious.  I made it with Ghirardelli premium baking chips and they were still melting hours later.  I dusted the cake with powdered sugar because it doesn't need frosting.  Absolutely divine.  Easy to make and our guests raved about it.  Make it, you'll love it too

DELICIOUS! So moist. I followed the recipe exactly - and wow is it ever good. My husband ate a piece and he said it was "soooo yummy". The only thing I did differently was I put it into two smaller bundt pans and baked for around 40-45 mins. I also rough chopped the semi-sweet morsels before throwing them in. Turned out perfect. This is now a go-to cake recipe for me. Thanks for sharing!

Cake got a little stuck in the bundt pan but I pieced it together and made a ganache and added kaluha to it. Served with coffee ice cream. Rich and ridiculously chocolatey. Husband said best he's had. Next time I make I'll use shortening on the pan. Pam butter doesn't always work with heavier cakes.

This was absolutely delicious! I used regular size chocolate chips and I really enjoyed the texture they gave. I would not want to use mini chips and have them melt into the cake. I coated this with a very tasty ganache from joyofbaking.com.  I almost always bake from scratch but I'll be making this again.

DH said this is the best cake he has ever eaten.  It turned out very moist and it has an excellent light texture.  I used Betty Crocker Triple Chocolate Cake mix rather than Devil's Food and I added 1/3 cup of milk.  I omitted the water.  Really good!  Thank you for the recipe.

I received this recipe from an old friend while living in LAke Tahoe, CA......she made it exactly as written, which is what I have done for my kids birthdays (their request)  for a good 20 years!  We do however, add a topping.  A small carton of cool whip mixed with a small box of Vanilla instant pudding mix and about 1/4 cup (or to taste) of Gran Marnier.......Amazingly good with or without the topping!

LOVE! simple and KINDA honemade..Lol!
I reduced oil to 3/4 cup and as mentioned, added 1/2 cup milk. (I was scared how it would turn out due to it still being VERY thick) baked at 340 for 55 min... PERFECT!! can't wait to try this with different flavor cake mix and pudding!!

I made this cake yesterday and it was deeeee-lish. 
Soft, light and moist. The only 2 things I changed were: I didn't add the 2 cups of chips (sprinkled a little bit) and replaced that with approximately 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseeds.
I used a chocolate ganache recipe that used sour cream and that was the ultimate finish!

My hubby loved this cake. I followed the suggestions and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk. I didn't have sour cream so I just used Greek yogurt.  It was spectacular. I added Trader Joe's fudge sauce to top it off.   I will definitely make this cake for  my hubby's birthday.

Not only is it very flavourful but moist as well.

This cake is one of the best I have ever made! Will be my favorite chocolate cake from now on. And it is super easy. I used the chocolate glaze with condensed milk from AR with it, and it is perfect for this cake and also very easy!

I usually make everything from scratch, including chocolate cake. I buy expensive cocoa and chips to make sure it meets my family's chocolate requirements. But This easy box cake was amazing and I'm not going back to my old recipe again. I followed this recipe exactly except I followed other reviewers recommendations. I only put in 1 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 cup oil, 1/3 cup heavy cream (didn't have milk), and put in espresso powder with the warm water to bring out the chocolate flavor. I also only had the instant 3.4 oz pudding mix, but it still tasted fine. I cooked this in a 13 X 9 pan for about 45 minutes and it was divine!!! Didn't need To frost this, so good!! I will try the original recipe that calls for all oil and no dairy, but for this time around adding the dairy gave it a good crumb and it wasn't crispy on the outside.

I was in a pinch for time, so I opted to make this cake versus actually making a cake from scratch. Boy, this was a big hit!!!  I made this into a two layered cake, and used the Chocolate icing from this site as well. My son took 3 pieces to work, and he came home exclaiming how the guys declared this the most moist cake they have ever eaten.  Thank you for submitting.

Oh my goodness, this is the best cake I have ever made. I live in a very high altitude (7500') area and bundt cakes are the only cakes I can make that don't implode. I have been searching for years for a recipe made with a box mix that I can change up. Last nite using this recipe, I made an orange cake, I hesitated a minute on the full cup of oil, then I read another review and she commented that it WAS a cake. So on I went the heck with the fat and calories!  I substituted 1/2 c. of juice from canned mandarin oranges for the water plus added 2 T. flour for high altitudes. 
I always use the container frosting, but I have to make it my own. I used vanilla frosting added butter, a few drops of orange extract and 2 T of juice from mandarin oranges. I added powdered sugar and beat it to the right consistency. I had put about 3/4 c. of mandarin oranges on a paper towel to drain, then chopped them and folded them into the frosting. 
When the cake was done, I waited 1 1/2 - 2 hours before I flipped it. (Per recipe). I didn't taste it till this morning, this cake is WONDERFUL!!  I will definitely make the chocolate and a family favorite; cherry chip and on and on and on. To the person who submitted this recipe a great big THANK YOU I have finally found the bundt cake recipe that I've been searching for!!!!!!
Be sure to note the recipe calls for the LARGE box of instant pudding not the usual small box.

Unfortunately I didn't see the comments about cake mixes being smaller, so my proportions were wrong. While the cake was tasty, it was way too rich for us. I won't make it again and will stick to buying my chocolate cakes at Portillo's.

I've made this cake several times and my family loves it!  I've made it as written and a couple variations. Love it either way.  I prefer the mini chocolate chips when I make it all chocolate.  I've also exchanged the chocolate chips for Peanut Butter Chips and used the Satiny Chocolate glaze recipe but when I use the PB  chips I substitute them in the glaze as well... it's my most requested family Bday cake!

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had. I did a few minor changes. I replaced half the oil with cinnamon applesauce. I only put in 1-1/4 cups of the chocolate chips. The other 3/4 cup I used for the satiny chocolate glaze recipe also from this website. Topped it the cake off with powdered sugar and the glaze. Fantastic!

Fabulous cake!  It's moist and dense--but not too dense.  The deep chocolate flavor is so satisfying.  I made the cake just as the recipe specified, but frosted it with--what else--chocolate frosting!  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

I found this cake to be too oily. When I turned it upside down on the plate, my hands were covered in oil.   Darn, I wish I had read the reviews before I made it.  I am wondering if other people had the same problem. I will try it again but with a half cup of oil.

I reduced oil to 1/2 cup, used a small box of pudding, and reduced chocolate chips to 1 cup.  I also added 1 tsp instant coffee.  I made a cream cheese icing.  It was good, but not awesome.  I think I am (and the husband and kids too) just not a chocolate cake person!

I'm in love with this concept. The taste was beyond delicious. I frosted it with a very thick, dark ganache. Most of my choco chips sank to the bottom of the pan, even after I covered them generously with flour, and that's because my batter came out a little too watery, even though I added only half the quantity of water suggested in  the recipe. I don't blame the original poster for it, though. I'm the one who must compensate for the local altitude/humidity. I'll cut the chips smaller next time, and experiment with the oil/water and wet/dry ingredients ratio.

I've made this many times. After being told some people don't like chocolate chips IN the cake, I made a ganache to pour over top instead. Goes over much better and the fudgy layer adds to an already wonderful cake.

Loved this cake!!  So easy for when you don't have time to make a "from scratch" cake.  I did substitute fresh dark brewed coffee in place of the water, and added a touch more vanilla.   It was moist and chocolatey!

I used two cups of Andes Chocolate Creme de Ment  chips and another two cups of Andes Peppermint Crunch baking chips. I didn't have sour cream so I made my own. One cup of heavy cream and 1Tbs lemon juice. Walaaaaaaa! Moist and delicious.

This cake is amazing!  I'm a chocoholic and my daughter made this for me for my birthday!  It was the highlight of my birthday.  I've made it a few times since due to requests from family members.  I slightly reduce the oil and use the satiny chocolate glaze that was recommended by another reviewer.

I made this cake last night and it was amazing.  I did substitute the sour cream w/ a low fat option, the eggs w/ egg whites and the oil with unsweetened applesauce like someone else had suggested.  I shared it w/ my neighbors and they loved it.  This will definitely be a go to recipe when I need to whip up a dessert.  Super easy.

Outstanding taste and easy to make cake. This has to be the best cake recipe using a cake mix I have tried to date. Delicious rich chocolate flavor and the pudding mix keeps it so moist. Our whole family - kids 8, 10 and 12 - and adults loved it.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out super moist and delicious. The ganache was easy to make, and such a great addition to this cake. The recipe called for a 12" bundt pan and I only have a 10", so I filled my 10" to within 1 1/2 inches of the top and put the rest of the batter in a greased glass loaf pan. They both turn out great.  I will be making this cake again and again.

To me this cake was just OK.  The only substitution I made was  coffee for the water.  The cake was crusty on the outside, which I think is OK when its bread but not in a cake. I don't know if that's because my cake mix was only 15.25 oz instead of 18.25 oz. It was moist on the inside and I found myself eating just the center part.  I don't think it was anything special and I don't think I will be making this again.

I have made this cake several times, and every time it is delicious. Last week I brought it to a dinner party, and everyone raved about how good it was. The only change I made is to reduce the amount of oil to 1/2 cup, and it turns out perfectly.

This cake is so delicious. I did adjust the ingredients in proportion to the cake mix size and replaced the water with coffee as suggested in another review. I made it for my son-in-law's birthday cake. He asked for the recipe and was pleased as punch when he got to take home the remaining cake pieces. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

One of our absolute favorites.  I sometimes add dark chocolate chips and either dust it with powdered sugar, cover it with frosting, or leave it plain.  We often serve it with ice cream and homemade raspberry syrup.  Its is wonderful- and the best part is that it is all healthy!  Well, that's my theory.

I make 1 cake from this site and that's the Banana Cake VI.  It's everybody's favorite cake and all of my friends request that banana cake for their birthdays.  That is, until I made this cake.  Now I've been asked to make this cake for the next birthday.   The satiny chocolate glaze was the perfect frosting to accompany the cake.  Simple and amazing.

So I guess this is a mistake, but if so, it's the best mistake I've ever baked.
I thought I had 2 containers of sour cream (plenty enough f or the recipe) but it turned out I only had 1/3cup sour cream and 2/3 cup of honey strawberry flavored Greek yogurt.

My cake tastes like a chocolate drenched strawberry. Best thing EVER.

OMG!  This is so good I have friends and family ask me to make this for events.  I use mini chocolate chips , it disperses the chocolate better.  Depending on my event I do a chocolate glaze over the cake or just powdered sugar, either way it is just great!

I made this cake for a family reunion a couple years ago and I've been asked to make it every year since. It's a big hit and usually the first dessert gone! Super chocolatey and moist. I've stopped it with just powdered sugar as well as a chocolate glaze.  Love it!

I'm not a big baker but wanted a nice, chocolaty cake for my son's 31st birthday and this was perfect!  I used the Duncan Hines devil's food cake mix and Jello chocolate pudding.  I used espresso instead of water and reduced the oil and choc chips as suggested by other reviewers. I put caramel sauce and pecans on top.  Many rave reviews from everyone!

I made this cake, as written, except I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips. I placed the chips in the middle of the cake, it almost made a "tunnel" in the center of the cake. I did not put icing on cake.

Best chocolate cake in the world!!  I don't change a thing except I use icing instead of powdered sugar and sometimes I have to bake it longer. EVERYONE loves it and asks for it on special occasions. My advice is make it AS IS!  Thank you for such a great recipe Denise!

This cake is fool proof and delicious! I can easily see why it has so many 5 star reviews. I followed the ingredients with the exception of using mini chocolate chips instead of the regular size (per another reviewer). I also topped the cake with a chocolate glaze and mini chocolate chips.

I have made this several times, with and without modifications- mini chocolate chips, dusting regular choc. chips so they don't sink, adding milk, etc. (read other reviewers and you'll catch my drift), using a devils food cake recipe from scratch.... I use the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site to top it.  Winning recipe, no matter how I've made it:) Would love to know how it would turn out as cupcakes!

The simple additions to the boxed mix make for a nice dense and chocolatey bundt. I used a 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup of water and it was just fine.  Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site was a quick and easy addition. Update: Also made as 2 9" round cakes and baked for 27 minutes.

I've made this cake about half a dozen times now.  The only change I make is to only use 3/4 cup of oil instead of a full cup.  It is easy to make, and always turns out excellent.  People think it is from a bakery.

I changed the cake mix to vanilla, the pudding mix to Oreo pudding mix, and the chocolate chips to crushed mini Oreos. It turned out to be one of the best cakes I've ever made!

I love this recipe, like some people I use 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup milk. I also use instant coffee in the warm water. I make a cream cheese glaze (regular cream cheese frosting but use milk or vanilla coffee creamer to thin it out) 
I'm constantly asked for the recipe.

Perfection. You will need to adjust to your own oven, but the recipe is perfection. Add the ganache and you have perfection squared. Is that a thing? Love this recipe and especially love that it is excellent exactly as written.

Fellow chocoholics...beware! This recipe puts your "diet" out the window. I LOVE IT. I have to tell my husband to take it to work with him though because if I'm left alone, that cake doesn't stand a chance.

I made this tonight as a little thank you to my husband. I had to use olive oil instead of vegetable because I forgot to grab it at the store. Anyhow, I did 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk and cooked it at 335 for 50mins (per previous suggestions), & it turned out perfectly! I will definitely be adding this to my recipe book.

I made it with only one change - a little less on the chocolate chips (about 3/4 of the bag).  I did notice it was a bit oily.  I saw a few reviews where the amount of oil was changed.  I really liked the cake and will make it again but will try less oil or sub 1/2 of oil with applesauce.  I also think I will experiment with some other flavor combos.

I used Mexican sour cream. Tastes much better. Also used dark chocolate bits since more healthy and make cake taste really rich.

Being your regular chocolate fanatic, I love trying recipes with lots of chocolate. This one filled the bill and was so easy to make. Just to take it over the top, I covered it with a chocolate ganache. Was it a hit with my family and guests? Oh yes - seconds were rule. The only quibble I have is with the name "Too Much Chocolate Cake". Seriously? Is too much chocolate even possible. I will be making this cake again - and again ...

I got this recipe, with a few changes, from a relative and an Air Force wife friend more than 30 years ago!  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, and 1  T. of instant coffee. ( Coffee intensifies the chocolate flavor!) I also use only 6 oz. of the chips in the cake and use the other 6 ox to make a choc. glaze. Melt the chips, 2 T of light corn syrup, and 1 tsp. H2O. Use to glaze the cake!  YUM!

I did make others' suggested change of using 3/4 c. oil.  I used warm cinnamon flavored coffee in place of water, and 1 c. of the choc chips.  Choc is not my fave flavor of cake, but this was so good and delicious, and moist!!  I also put some milk chocolate frosting on top( from the store bought tub). I will make again, sooner than later.

Amazing Cake!  I made this for a birthday cake and it was a HUGE hit!  I followed the changes some had discussed in reviews: 1/2 cup of oil and added 1/3 cup milk and I used 1 Cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.   The cake was PERFECT!  I made 2 9"round cakes and used a recipe for chocolate cream cheese frosting with a little cinnamon and some vanilla.  Adults and kids loved this cake.  I've been asked to make it for every birthday celebration in the future. :)

I followed this recipe to the letter and my family loved it! This cake is very moist and rich. I used a dulce de leche filling and it tasted even better! I took some to work and my coworkers are still asking me about it. I will definitely be making this recipe again. Warning: The batter is super thick, once you've mixed all the ingredients. So you definitely need a spoon/spatula to pour it in the pan.

Fantastic cake recipe, so easy to prepare and the closest I've ever come to a Portillo's chocolate cake (for anyone in Chicagoland who knows Portillo's!). I used mini chocolate chips like a couple of the other reviewers. This cake is super-moist, velvety and the ultimate for any chocolate lover. I used the satiny glaze recipe on this site for the frosting/glaze.

I have been using this recipe for years after finding it in a recipe book at the check out lines.  I've entered about 5 different baking contests with it and have won every time.  Everyone always says it's the most moist cake they've had I usually throw in dark chocolate chunks instead of semi-sweet because the chunks don't melt as much and that way you get chunks of chocolate in your bites.  I use Cream Cheese frosting to top it off and it's all good

Big hit even with folks who don't care for chocolate! Moist and rich texture. I used "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" instead of powdered sugar.

Amazing chocolaty heaven! This recipe is the absolute best. I used the mini chocolate chips as suggested by one reviewer and loved them in this cake! I used this recipe tripled for two 12 inch rounds and frosted/filled with the French Silk Frosting from this website and every bite was divine!  It is moist yet still fluffy and not too dense. Wonderful fudgey flavor. It was a favorite at the party and this will be my go to for chocolate cake from now on! I highly recommend the French Silk Frosting recipe with this cake as well. I am sure it is good either way but I just loved this combo.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe, but with mini chips and it came out like a big fabulous brownie. This time I used mayo for the sour cream, half oil and milk and coffee for the water. I only had 1 cup mini chips. It came out like a tunnel of fudge cake. I just love this cake. I will be making it both ways for many years to come. Thanks for the recipe!

Hands down the most delicious thing I've ever made. I know that sounds superlative but it's true. Incredibly easy to make and I followed the recipe to a T. I did as others suggested and topped with the satiny chocolate glaze and chocolate chips, but this cake is incredible enough to stand alone as is.

So delicious, especially warmed a bit due to the chocolate chips inside. Used Nestle Toll House semi-sweet chips. Could make a strawberry or cherry glaze but think the chocolate glaze makes it too rich. I used powdered sugar. Could not find the cake mix recommended so used Duncan Hines Swiss Chocolate and it was fantastic! Took exactly 50 minutes. Cooled 1 1/2 hrs in pan before inverting. Just sprayed inside bundt pan with PAM only. I would highly recommend this moist, chocolate cake.

All thumbs up from the fam. Made on vacation so had to use a 9x13 pan. Turned out great. Iced it with basic cream cheese frosting. YUM. Only change I will make for next time is to use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. Just my personal preference.

This was my first time making a bundt cake. I was initially a bit disappointed that I couldn't find a "scratch" recipe with such good reviews. After making this, I've changed my mind! This cake was awesome!!! This will be my go to recipe for chocolate bundt cake. I paired it with cream cheese frosting. To die for!!

I have to admit, I tend to shy away from any boxed cake mix. However, I plunged ahead with this one, and I'm glad I did. The addition of sour cream and chocolate chips helped in "masking the box-y" cake flavor. I used this recipe as a base for a layered cake. I followed the directions, but I made this into 2 layers. I made a generous batch of chocolate ganache to use as a "filling" between the layers, and I made my own berry whipped cream to spread over the top. Dusted with black cocoa powder and it was stunning! I let it sit in the fridge over night to help develop the flavors. Will keep this in my personal favorite folder :)

I normally don't rate recipes but this one is definitely one that you want to keep in you r back pocket! I love this recipe for when I don't have time but want something to impress or share  and the best thing is that you can adapt it to fit whatever you are caving at that moment! I did a white chocolate cake and cheesecake pudding with white chocolate on top! mmmmm you must at least try this one!

It was well like from the birthday boy but to be honest i thought it was way to wet/moist. 
I did follow the recipe to the letter but would probably make some alterations should i use it again.

Lots of chocolate flavor.  The texture was spongy, and had an off flavor.  The sour cream and vegetable oil gave it a wonderful moistness and I loved the chocolate chips and bundt shape. I won't make again.

Excellent and I have been making this for many years. I think this is the old Sock it to Me Cake from the 60's. Very deep chocolate flavor and very rich.  (Note to self - big oven, done 45.) **For those wanting to cut fat, be careful, as light sour cream turns watery and will affect the result of the cake, making it more dense.**

I guess county fairs have changed quite a bit over the years because I can't imagine entering a cake using a boxed mix into a competition...that surprised me. That said, this is a good cake recipe if you want simple and fast.

Love this recipe. Definitely a keeper & fast to make. I made minor changes: used 3/4 cup of olive oil, 1/3 cup of milk, 1 cup of mini bittersweet chocolate morsel. Dusted with powdered sugar. I think mine could be sweeter with a glaze or whipped frosting. May try other combinations next time. Thank you sharing!

Super moist, rich flavor (but not overly so).  

Subbed applesauce for veg oil, used mini chocolate chips instead of semisweet morsels.  The mini chips spread throughout the whole batter, instead of semisw chips sinking to bottom of bundt pan.  

Added 2T of coffee granules to the batter - adds another layer of earthy richness to the cake.  

Did I mention it's extremely moist?  mmm  hmm...

This cake is a chocolate lover's dream. I only used 3/4 cup of sour cream, and 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also added another 1/4 cup of water, and used white instead of brown eggs. I used a rectangular cake pan, and baked about 50 minutes. I let it cool for an hour, and then cut in half to make 2 cakes. I frosted with Hershey Chocolate fudge frosting. The most delicious cake ever!!

I made this cake for the 1st time for a Baby Shower and got rave reviews!  Some compared it to that huge layered chocolate cake from Costco. The only change I made was I decreased the oil to 3/4 cup (per reviewers suggestions). This will be my go to recipe from now on!

Yes, I slathered more ganache atop than most. But then it wouldn't otherwise be called Too Much Chocolate Cake! Everyone loved this cake. I should've made two!

I haven't made this cake yet, but as a chocoholic I will be making it soon.  I suggest for those whose  chocolate chips (or nuts) fall to the bottom of the cake - mix them with about 1/2 cup of the flour before mixing into the cake.  They won't fall to the bottom again.  I gave this 5 stars because it sounds wonderful - can't wait to make it.

I made the recipe just as is and it turned out dense and moist and wonderful. I did cupcakes, and the recipe made 24 heaping beauties. And baked for 20 minutes. When they first came out the tops were like brownie crust. But after over night in an airtight container they were soft. Both ways were delicious. I was told they were my best cupcakes ever and that they were like the fillet mignon of cupcakes.  I topped them with the Chocolate Fudge buttercream Frosting recipe (made with all butter and no shortening), also from this site,  which is hands down the best there is.. 
Thank you for such a great treat!

According to the recipe it calls for a boxed cake mix roughly 18.25 oz. - I could not find a single company that makes one that size, so used the only option 15.25 oz. size box ( I bought one Pillsbury Moist Supreme devils food and one Betty Crocker super moist devils' food), as I made a double recipe.  I wonder as there is less mix in these smaller boxes of cake mix, should one increase the flour or something else in the recipe?  I don't know, if anyone has any idea please post it.  I didn't, but not sure if it would help.  

I actually made this into cupcakes, and the baking time ended up being a lot longer (than what it stated on the box for cooking time), roughly 28 minutes on 350 degrees.  I used paper baking cups in the muffin pan, and noticed once taking them out the tray was loaded in grease, and the paper baking cups were soaked in oil (after baking), had to put them on a paper towel to absorb the oil.

I think this recipe works best as a cake rather than cupcakes, but if you do it with cupcakes, remember to change the cooking time (its NOT what it says on the box, as they would be raw), needed roughly 28-30 minutes.  Also if doing as cupcakes, I would decrease the amount of oil used - not sure by how much less, but definitely a lot less, I would try 1/2 the oil quantity in the recipe.  

Otherwise they came out nice.  Made a buttercream frosting to use on top of these.

Made quite a few cupcakes - forgot how many but roughly 40+ with a double recipe.

Made this Monday night (3/28/2016) for my daughter's 13th birthday. 
Per reading some comments here, I opted to add only a few milk chocolate chips on top, less to sink & burn at the bottom, instead of the 2 cups suggested. 
Only used 3/4 cup sour cream. 
Also folded 2-4 tablespoons of caramel sundae topping to the batter, before scooping into the greased, flowered prepared pans. 
& used 1 - 9 inch pan, 1 - 8 inch pan & 1 - 3.5 inch pan! 
Something different. She loved it! 
Baked it 35 minutes on 350, checked it, not done, turned heat down to 300 for last 15 miutes, checked every 5 min until done. (Didn't want it dried out.) 
The cake was fabulous!! Talk about delicious!! ????Moist! Scrumptious! YUMMY! 
Maybe add some 'Lindt Lindor Milk Chocolate' pieces chopped up or 'Milk Duds' chopped up (so they melt).

Made homemade chocolate butter cream frosting (that didn't turn out so well, 1st time tried it.) Maybe if  I'd attempted it different recipe or used ingredients, results would have been more successful, but I used what I had on hand. {Word to the wise: Don't use Almond extract, [or if you do, use 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. not 1 tsp., amplifies the "CHOCOLATE" taste] to make chocolate butter cream frosting, & use less coacoa powder (1/4 cup), than calls for.]
But, this will be my new main go-to cake to make. 
The butter cream frosting, will not be chocolate, or if so, made with vanilla. Will keep you posted. ?

Fantastic cake! I goofed and bought a 15.9 oz triple chocolate cake mix instead of an 18 oz box of devils food cake. So I had to adjust a little. Used 3/4 c light sour cream, 1/2 c oil, and added 1/2 c skim milk because my batter was too thick. But it still came out great! Topped with a chocolate glaze recipe posted on this site, some mini chocolate chips & Heath topping. Tasted even better after sitting in the frig a day. Will definitely make again. Best chocolate cake ever!

I was wondering what you did about not being able to find a 18.25 oz cake mix.  They have shrunk them to 15 oz and still charging more.

I couldn't find the exact ounces of cake and pudding so i used a little less turned out AMAZING i made a drizzle from better homes and gardens and have made the cake 2 times in 1 week! It is very moist and yummy. I ALWAYS decorate cakes they take all day so i wanted something easy. This was JUST that! For changes I used 1/2 cup oil.

Absolutely love this cake!  However, I can never find bigger than a 15.25 oz cake mix. Anyone have any suggestions of where to find the 18 oz cake mixes?

This is a family go-to recipe. My sister found it first, and we use it for most birthdays. It was my turn and I looked at some reviews. I tried applesauce in place of oil and low-fat sour cream instead of full-fat. I also frosted it. It was a big hit! I think I prefer the taste with applesauce to the oil. This is a great chocolate fix. I am going to try different pudding flavors in the future.

My favorite cake, but I don't have a bundt pan so I use a cake pan and decreased cooking time to 40 min which was still a bit much.  Next time I'll try 30 minutes.

Hubby just came back for seconds and asked if I had ever made him chocolate cake before. Yes baby I have!!! LOL!!! Clearly this recipe is the keeper. I didn't have any chocolate chips so I added frosting from the Texas chocolate sheet cake V.  It worked!! Thanks for the recipe and congrats on your win!!

I liked making cupcakes instead.  Especially if you don't have a bundt pan. Gave it a nice crisp top.  Spray liners with non stick spray.  Fill 3/4 full.  Bake at 325 for 30-35 minutes.  Frost with creamy chocolate frosting by Tracy Larsen.   Makes 24 delicious treats.

I am looking for a chocolate cake recipe to make for my grandson. But most recipes I looked at all start with the same ingredient : Boxed cake mix" Where is the pride of home baking in this. I pay a yearly fee for Allrecipes.com for the simple fact that I'm not a taker and putting sites like those cost money. Or maybe because I am a Canadian and do not understand. But I still mostly use recipes from AR.

with my husband and daughter being huge chocolate fans, I had to make this....used the mini chips as suggested by other reviewers, but made the cake exactly as written...I used the Nordic wear heritage bundt pan (looks like a swirl) and it turned out beautifully! dusted with powdered sugar...everyone loved it, and were surprised to have little bits of melted chocolate all through it..can't wait to try other combinations that others have suggested...between 6 people, the cake was gone by the end of the evening..will definitely make this again!

I was given this recipe years ago when a friend brought to an event the absolute best cake I have ever had! The only difference is that it was a chocolate run cake!! Instead of the water and 1 cup of oil, use 1/2 cup of oil, 1/2 cup of Myres Dark Rum and 1/2 cup of cooled brewed coffee. I also only use 2 eggs. I serve it without icing so as not take away from the other great flavors. It is best served warm, but still incredible cold! For the record, when I first had the cake, it was served with a warm cherry sauce on top, but I like it plain!!

Fantastic, I have made it twice. Second time I used tiny chocolate chips which I liked better. I doubled it and made about 65 cupcakes for a party, I got rave reviews! With Nutella buttercream even better ;)

I've made this as a chocolate cake and as a yellow cake. Neither of them lasted very long.  I will only prepare box cakes this way for now on.  I did not change a thing, it's perfect. I will be making a lemon cake next.  As for the chocolate with chocolate chips... you DO NOT need to substitute with mini chocolate chips.  The batter is so thick, that the chocolate chips do not sink to the bottom at all.

This is delicious!  Left out to chocolate chips because I didn't have them on hand.  Baked  in a 13x9 pan for 40 min.  Frosted with a dark chocolate glaze.  The sour cream gives this a nice texture and taste.  yummy.

Very good cake.  I cut back oil to 3/4 c and used 1/2 c milk instead of water.  I forgot to add the chocolate chips, but it was still very very good.  Thank you for the recipe.

Everyone loves this cake!  I have made three in a week and plan to make two more this weekend. I also made a layer cake with frosting using this recipe.  I also tried a vanilla cake and vanilla pudding and that came out great!  Love it, love it, love it. This will be my main chocolate cake recipe.

This cake is awesome.  I made it a couple of years ago for my wife's birthday as she is a chocoholic. She asks for it every year. I made it with the chocolate satiny glaze found in here and it was to die for.  One suggestion is to use regular sized chocolate chips. I used the minis and didn't have the pockets of melted chocolate inside the cake

I've had this recipe since 1980. It's called inside out chocolate cake. Easy to make and so delicious. Very moist.  It's a permanent part of my collection   I never put frosting on it. Just dusted with powder sugar.

Instead of 2 cups of the chocolate chips I used a little less than 1 cup of the Andie's mint bites and it was really good

It is also good when it is gluten free

Love this! Made this several times and find you can use whatever size box of pudding you have. Also, mini chocolate chips work the best so that there are these little bites of chocolate goodness everywhere, although regular size work just fine too. Sprinkle some sifted powdered sugar on top and have some fresh berries and whipped cream to accompany it.

I made this cake for my husband for Valentine's Day.  I followed the recipe exactly and added a chocolate glaze using raspberry extract and then topped the cake with fresh raspberries. What a hit!!  He loved it!!  The way to a man's heart is through his tummy.  ???? Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

I used 1/2c oil and 1/2c water.  Otherwise no changes.  It's my signature gift and  it's   basically foolproof.  Also, I oil bundt cake pan and coat with cocoa (can use sweetened cocoa if preferred), so no white flour coating.  Needs no frosting,    Travels well and freezes beautifully.  FABULOUS!

I have used this recipe several times with different twist and it comes out perfect every time, everybody has liked it, it is the only cake I bake anymore, the only thing I would say is it does need frosting, I fill it with coconut pecan, and ice it with a dark fudge chocolate frosting, even the coconut pecan haters in my family love the cake, it is the first time I have seen my son eat coconut pecan frosting.

This was a delicious cake! I chose to put melted chocolate chips on top of the cake instead of adding them into the mixture as indicated in the recipe. I felt like this gave an attractive appearance while maintaining the perfect amount of chocolate flavor. If you're looking for a tasty and easy chocolate cake recipe, give this a try. It's definitely rich and full of chocolate goodness. The Devils food cake mix component of this recipe makes it easy and quick to prepare. It pays to be patient and let your cake cool a couple hours before removing from the baking pan. Waiting for the cake to cool was the most difficult part of this recipe. It looked and smelled so good I wanted to try a slice right out of the oven!

This cake was exceptional.  I followed the directions exactly as written (except I used the "mini" chocolate chips) and it came out very moist and delicious.  I preheated my oven about 20 minutes to make sure it was the right temperature and then baked the cake for 50 minutes without opening the oven door.  It turned out perfectly level.  However, I did notice the outer edge of the cake and a thin ring around the center hole of the bundt pan cooked a little more than the rest but not bad.  I wonder if next time I should reduce the heat a bit maybe the last 15 minutes of bake time.  Either way, this cake is so moist and delicious, you will be glad you made it.  For a glaze, I followed others recommendations and made the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site.  It was delicious on this cake.  Both recipes are definitely keepers.

If you don't mind boxed cake then this is good.  I made the recipe as written with no modifications.  I saw so many great reviews that I had to give it a try.  My kids ate it up, but hubby and I didn't finish one piece.  You can taste the oil in it.   I'd love to find a similar recipe made from scratch using butter.

Amazing! I used fudge cake mix, chocolate pudding and Reese's peanut butter chips. I had to bake it a little over an hour to get a clean toothpick.  Clearly my bundt pan was too small because it erupted in my oven like a volcano. What a mess, but it sure was worth it for my co-worker's birthday. It was a big hit and something I will definitely try again in a bigger pan! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us, Denise!

This is THE BEST chocolate cake recipe I've ever tried. I've been looking for something that people would request and I found it! Everyone loves this cake. I served it with chocolate ganache and chocolate whipped cream can you say too much chocolate lol. It was perfect. The only reason I put 4 stars and not 5 is the calories and I had 3 pieces. Oops

Very easy to make. Only edits I'd make next time would be to grease AND flour to pan, and do not try and take out of the pan until the cake is fully cooled. The cake is VERY chocolate-y and rich, so I reccomend small slices.

The best cake ever!!!  So rich, moist and & delicious.  Based on others reviews, I did buy a fudge cake mix, used 3 eggs, 1/3 cup of warm water, added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 bag mini chocolate chips and less oil and some milk.  Cooked at 335 for about 55 - 60 minutes.  I crave this cake.

Have made multiple times. Go to cake for the whole family. Hint...... Don't be skimpy with the powdered sugar. If you pile enough on and press it in lightly it takes on a little crunch after it sets a little. Only chocolate cake we make now!

I've been making this cake for years.  I do tweak it like many other cooks.  I always make my favorite "from scratch" chocolate cake base from dry ingredients, then continue on as though I started with a box cake.  It certainly makes the cake "perfect" and a favorite in my house.

I made this cake today. I had a devil's food cake box that was getting old and didn't want to toss it. I took some advise from several other reviews. Lowered the oil to 3/4cup, used 1cup mini chips and used coffee instead of water and added a splash of vanilla. Used a bundt pan and baked at about 340 for 55min...turned out wonderful! Best success I've had with a new recipe in a while. We've been nibbling on it plain and it's great but I think I'll go try the glaze the reviews mentioned...definitely a keeper...oh, I used a small box of the pudding

The three major brands of cake mix did not have the 18.25 oz size, but had it in a 15.25 oz size. I adjusted the liquid ingredients to compensate for this difference. The cake turned out wonderfully and everyone raved about how moist and flavorful it was. Very easy to make.

I followed the recipe and used mini chocolate chips. I dusted with powdered sugar and put a pretty flower in the center and took it to a dinner party where it was a big hit. Next time I will glaze the cake for richer taste. Tastes better the next day. Will make again.

This cake is amazing!  The combination of the chocolate cake, pudding and chips makes the perfect chocolate cake.  It is full of flavor without being overwhelmingly sweet.

Thee BEST chocolate cake ever.  The young people in my life wolfed the cupcakes down and asked for more.  Only thing I did differently was to add some quartered banana slices . . . since I love the combination of chocolate and  various fruits.  A friend tasted one and, although she's never been interested in baking, she made them for all of her extended family!

I made this exact same cake recipe for my husbands' birthday yesterday! It has been one of my favorites for 35 years. This recipe was published in the early '80's from the employees of United Airlines in Seattle. It came from our Sales Secretary, Karen Fudge. Remembering all my old UAL friends & the great times we had! Not to mention, great food!

Have made this cake for years.  Nothing but compliments.  Only use 1/2 cup of oil and frost it with powdered sugar.  I have pre-cut slices and taken it to work and neighorhood BBQ's and it only needs a napkin , no fork or plate (the frosting would be to messy for eating by hand).  Making it again tomorrow for a pot luck.  Very simple and always a hit!

I love this recipe for the most part.  I've done it as called for using mini chocolate chips so they don't sink to the bottom, and I've also done the same thing with a yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it seems to be limited as to what shape/size of cake you make.  I've done the bundt cake & that's great, I've done a standard 9" round cake, and that comes out fine.  I've tried to do larger cakes, and this cake is so heavy and the chocolate chips impact the ability of the cake to hold together that it falls apart.  I make larger cakes for various reasons, and I would love to use this recipe for those because it is so yummy and moist, but I haven't had success so far.  If I had, I would have given this 5 stars.

Delicious and ultra dark chocolate cake.   I added a teaspoon of vanilla and used 6 tablespoons of all purpose flour to add to the mixture since cake mixes are no longer 18.25 ounces.   It's very moist and not dense.  Will definitely make it again.

I've made this so many times and it always turns out great. I use 2 cups of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. Bake it in a bundt pan. Once cooled, I cover it with chocolate ganache made with 1 cup of scolded heavy cream and 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.

This cake was very moist and chocolatey.  Tasted like a brownie!  I also added the satiny chocolate glaze like another review mentioned,  and it was perfect!  I served this to a crowd, and it pleased all!

I don't normally like cake at all, I'm a pie person, but this takes the cake! I used coconut oil (healthier) and added 1/3 c. of milk. I didn't know cake could taste this good. I think this would taste so good with a can of cherry pie filling in it too. I made some buttercream frosting (so easy to make in 2 mins flat) and cooked it for about 60 mins in an 8x11 pan.

Omg, if there is a better chocolate cake anywhere I have never had it and don't think I want it I would be strung out on cake...lol!  This one is addictive and I am a true chocoholic and it more than satisfied any chocolate craving. I did add the chocolate ganache, but with or without it this cake was moist and rich .  This is a cake for special occasions a treat for a good month of dieting, birthdays and holidays.  I have some cake left and if I had not hidden it from my niece and nephews there may have truly been a death by chocolate in my family.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I added a chocolate glaze to it and it was absolutely delicious. 

For the glaze:
1  3.5oz dark chocolate bar (I like 70%)
1/4 cup of melted butter
3-4 tablespoons of light corn syrup depending on how thick you want your glaze to be

I made this recipe exactly as written, including the satiny glaze. I have to say, I feel very misled by how highly rated this cake was!!! I, an avid cake and chocolate LOVER, did not really care for this recipe. I didn't think it was quite sweet enough and it had a slight "chemically" taste to it. Definitely does not compete with truly "made from scratch" recipes.

This cake is awesome!! For personal preference I now use 1/2 cup of my homemade applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil and its still delicious!!! I also layer the batter and chips so that they are more evenly distributed. Definitely a favorite around here!!

These were amazing!  I wanted cupcakes, which ended up baking at 350 for 19 minutes.  I got 30 of the most moist and delicious cupcakes I have ever eaten.  Be aware that they don't rise quite as much as normal cupcakes, so you really need to fill the muffin tins 3/4 full of batter.  Also, I swapped out mini chocolate chips for the regular sized ones (as I thought that size suited cupcakes better), and it worked perfectly!

Instead of water, use strong coffee... Brings out the chocolate. Also, I use the mini chocolate chips... they don't sink to the bottom of the cake & are small enough that they melt completely, leaving a small bit of pure chocolate pleasure in each bite of cake, absolutely delicious!

This is an amazing cake and very easy. I suggest ignoring the reviews that say to reduce the oil. I made this both ways and it is so much more moist and delicious with the full amount! I understand the desire to avoid the oil for health reasons but it's a chocolate cake...it's really not going to be too healthy no matter how you slice it so you might as well get the full effect! In my opinion, you're really missing out on a great cake when you skimp on the oil because it seemed to change the texture significantly. This is a great recipe; will definitely be bringing this to family holiday dinners in the future. Didn't even need frosting!

Guests loved this cake! The only advice I would offer is when using the stick technique to see if it is cooked, keep in mind there are chocolate chips in the recipe. I used the technique a few times and the stick would come out coated in chocolate, I almost burnt the cake thinking in needed more time! I am also a beginner to baking though.. so for any other beginners..words of wisdom!

This is the most wonderful chocolate bundt cake, actually the finest recipe for ANY bundt cake that I have ever eaten. I wouldn't change a thing. How could one fix what isn't broken.  My daughter says, out of 5 star ratings, she gives it a 6.

I agree this is the best chocolate cake ever - VERY VERY moist - was a hit at a party and with our weekend guests - it was all gone before Monday and it was just four of us! I don't even prefer cake as a dessert but would make this again in a heartbeat. I would have loved some tips for working with a even buying a bundt pan; I never had and it went bad when I tried to get it out of the pan - let it cool and everything. Luckily this was so moist I just stuck the pieces back on and you couldn't even tell. I can't believe you don't even need frosting, but you don't.

I made this cake for a friends daughter for her Sweet 16 and it was a huge hit. I added a pinch of salt, used a bag of mini-morsels and and used Zero Transfat Whirl butter substitute instead of oil because didn't have enough vegetable oil on hand and it turned out great.

I have made many chocolate cakes in my life time but, I have to say (so did everyone else) this is the very best ever. I shared it with my neighbor, and her family had a fight over the last piece...lol. I had to send her the recipe that day and she made it that night. I didn't change a thing, didn't have to. It was easy and quick and delicious. Those are the recipes I love. This one's a definite keeper.

Fantastic cake!  I made it exactly like the recipe says because I hate having to read all the reviews to find out how to make the recipe better.  If the recipe has to be modified that much I'll just find a different recipe...  My family, even the ones who claim to not like sweets, loved this cake!  It will definitely be placed in the "family favorites" cookbook!

I made it in a 9x13 baking pan and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, fat- free sour cream & sugar-free pudding as other reviewers suggested. It was OMG Delicious! My family is more of a pie- eating bunch since cakes can be dry, but we were a cake-eating crew with this one! This cake is so moist and delicious that you can eat it without frosting.

So chocolatey and wonderful! I could only find boxes of devil's food cake mix in 15 oz sizes, so I ended up using that and forgoing the extra 3 ounces of cake mix. It was super tasty but I'd like to try the recipe as directed with more cake mix as well. I'd also top it with mini chocolate chips next time just for visual appeal.

Used triple chocolate fudge cake mix and Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate chips, followed the recipe exactly other than the ingredient changes!!! I also found a ganache recipe for the top and added more of those chocolate chips. Love it and will keep on making it!!

I made it with these adjustments. I used lowfat sour cream, reduced oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/3 cup skim milk. I made with a chocolate glaze and am trying again with a vanilla glaze...

I have made this cake several times and has been loved by everyone.  As long as you like chocolate you will love it too.  I have used it in other baking/cake pans as well, it makes a big batch so make sure not to over fill your pans. I have then made into birthdays and easy to frost and decorate.  LOVE THIS CAKE RECIPE!

I made this recipe with the exact same ingredients,  but I made it into cupcakes instead. Phenomenal. Cook it for only 20 minutes if you make cupcakes. Also, be prepared to have a ton of cupcakes. It makes about 25.

The first time I followed the recipe exactly and frosted it with peanut butter frosting..... a great hit with my Bible Study group! This time I used only half of the oil, used applesauce for the other half, and frosted with a vanilla cream cheese frosting...... another hit hopefully. I'm taking it to a luncheon tomorrow. If it is okay, I'll go for all applesauce next time, but I will surely be making it again! Moist and delicious..... never too much chocolate!

I made this cake for a dinner party. I used only 1/2 cup of oil and added 1/2 cup of milk instead. I forgot the chocolate chips but it still turned out great. It was so moist and full of flavor. Everyone was loving it and the whole cake was gone in minutes! It's already in my favorites!

I've made this recipe twice and nobody knew I used a box cake for part of the recipe. I also used sugar free pudding and fat free sour cream, just to make it a little more healthy. And it's still very rich and chocolatey. I made it the first time for Christmas and my family loved it. Even my cousin who doesn't care for chocolate cake loved it. I'll be making this for Christmas from now on!

I live at high altitude and followed advice to bake at 335 for 55 minutes. It was perfectly moist. Next, I made this dairy-free using Sour Supreme and Enjoy Life chips. Oh, and coffee instead of water. Delish!

Made this cake exactly to the recipe, only I used milk chocolate chips as well as the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It came out perfect, I was thrilled!!  I used the Satiny chocolate glaze from this website & it went together great!!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday. She is all things chocolate.

Used Ghirardelli semi-sweet dark chocolate chips. Cake turned out perfect. Took a little longer in the oven than I had expected. 

I also didn't let it cool for as long as recipe called for, but it came out of pan perfectly anyway. Served with Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Comfort. 

Was afraid it would be all too sweet but it wasn't. 

Very decadent!

This is an amazingly moist cake and all my family members ask me to make this for their birthdays. The only thing different I do is drizzle the top with milk chocolate and white chocolate and add chocolate dipped strawberries in the middle. Amazing!

After reading the reviews I knew I had to make this cake, and I'm so glad I did!!! A lot of reviews stated to use 3/4 cup of oil so I did. And the cake came out perfectly!! This is the most moist, chocolately, best tasting cake I've ever had. I also made the satin chocolate glaze that was on this website also. Both together were amazing! I'll be making this cake pretty often now :-)

Very rich chocolate cake. now I already make it twice since the first cake already eaten less than a week. too bad there isn't any sour cream sold in Indonesia, so I replaced it with thick plain yogurt, which is 'nearly' same. this is a good dessert after fasting, and a starter of my skill in baking cakes.

My family requests this a LOT!  Any other chocolate cake has been ruined for us......no need to ever use any other recipe! Perfect every time. I top it with home made ganache. We prefer it kept in the refrigerator but it is delicious warm and gooey too.

Perfect chocolate cake.  I've made it twice exactly as written.  Easy to make, tastes so moist & freezes well.

The only chocolate cake I make anymore, and I make it as written.  It's wonderful.  My mother, who doesn't particularly care for chocolate, said it was one of the best cakes she's ever eaten.  I'm making it again tomorrow for Fathers' Day!

Absolutely the best chocolate cake ever!!!!! Delicious.  Can't decide if its better warm or slightly chilled.  Warm the chocolate pieces are gooey yet the second day its a nice surprise to bite into the chocolate within the moist cake.  You can not go wrong with this!!!! I can't wait to try some of the other varieties suggested in the comments.

Made exactly as written and it was perfect! Didn't need any frosting!  So moist but not oily at all-not sure what others were talking about with there being too much oil-it tasted great.  I made it in a 10 cup bundt pan and while very full, it fit. :). I served it with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Yummy!!

An easy recipe that makes a great cake. Everyone enjoyed it. Serves many. Told my friend I was making it again for a party and she replied, "that cake is my kryptonite." A willpower killer - you've been warned.

I love this cake! We have out of state friends visiting and I wanted to make a desert quickly so I could join everyone outside. The cake did not take long to put together and is delicious. One change I made, was using 1 cup of Greek Yogurt in place of sour cream. I use Greek Yogurt as a substitute for sour cream often and it has always worked well for me. I also did not use the Glaze Icing on the cake but used powdered sugar instead. The cake was still a bit warm when I served it, so I added a scoop of ice cream. Everyone enjoyed the cake and my friend is now interested in checking out allrecipies. com!

This recipe was so great and didn't taste like a "doctored" cake at. I thought it would be a fun and delicious twist to add peanut butter chips next time. On the one I just baked I drizzled a caramel glaze and sprinkled sea salt. It was fantastic!

I make this recipe for our Legion dinners and it is wonderful!  So easy and moist even when I make three batches in one huge pan!  It was such a big hit I have been asked to make it for our cadet bake sale.  Definitely a keeper!

I gave this 5 stars. It was fantastic. I use the amount of oil that the recipe call for. I think to leave it out is a mistake. I added a little less than a 1/4 cup of cake flour because my husband got the wrong amount of cake fudge mix; and use 3.9oz of jello fudge pudding. Once again that's what he got. I had to bake it 15 minutes longer. It was excellent. Everyone love it. Definitely will make again. Thx

Moist & dense.  I like it the 2nd day even more! I used a regular homemade chocolate frosting called creamy chocolate  frosting, from allrecipes.  I did use 1/2 cup applesauce for the part of the oil.  Half & half for the water, just to use it up. I do not really like cake, esp chocolate. It was made for my family, but I did end up trying it, because it looked so good. Thinking about trying a chocolate/peanut butter chips combo next.

I am not much of a chocolate cake fan, but even I have to say this cake is one of the best I've ever tasted.  I've been making this a lot since I've found the recipe.  It's rich and moist and very easy to make.  I bake in small bundt pans, drizzle with chocolate ganache (overkill, I know) and use in my holiday goody bags as presents around Xmas.  It's a hit every time.

If you love chocolate you would love this. Follow the recipe. After it cooks, cools, and is on a plate. Add a 1/2 a bag of melted (milk chocolate) chocolate chips on top. Then add a handful or 2 of (milk chocolate) chocolate chips on top of the cake.

Wonderful, very moist cake!  My 3 yr. old was wanting to make a chocolate cake.  I had most of the ingredients on hand and had to substitute a few I didn't have or had little of.  I had to sub 1 cup greek yogurt for the sour cream, only had 1/2 c. choc. chips, and 1/2 c. eevoo (I added a tsp. of dark cocoa powder to mask any flavor from this oil). Even with the substitutions this recipe came out great.  Would make a great plain choc. cake as well, but I will definitely make again with all the chocolate chips next time (I love chocolate).  We ended up using a 9x13 pan as I don't have a bunt pan, and baked it for 325 in convection oven for 35-40 min.  Then we topped it with peanut butter frosting and mini m&ms (my sons touch).  Cannot wait to play around and try different flavors with this recipe.  Thanks!

Wow! Is this decadent! I first made this for my 10-year-old granddaughter's birthday. She's a chocoholic, but I'm slowly converting her to other flavors. I made it as the recipe prescribed at first, but have since experimented by subbing greek yogurt for the sour cream and later Fit & Lively yogurt instead of greek yogurt, skim milk for the water, decreasing the oil and subbing an equal amount of skim milk, adding raisins, etc... It freezes well, and Hubby and I enjoy a thin slice topped by fudge tracks icecream in the evening. Yummmmmmy. Try the idea behind this cake to a box of brownies - GREAT!

I work at a restaurant in my home town as a baker and tried this because I was curious. I have to tell you it was the BEST chocolate cake I have ever eaten! I used gherrideli dark chocolate pieses. It was so moist. Try it, believe me you will love it...all these 5 stars are the proof

Not a fan... this cake came out moist and rich, but I could barely eat any more after the first bite! It is beyond chocolaty, and I don't know how anyone could finish even a slice. Even my dad who loves chocolate could barely eat it. Too much!

This cake it always a hit whenever I bring it somewhere. It's a bit expensive, so I save it for important gatherings.
Do not attempt to leave this in your own home, or you will eat it all yourself.

Exactly what it sounds like. This is a super chocolatey cake, just a winner all around. I made up a simple glaze for it but I'm sure this would be great with or without. I did use about half the amount of chocolate chips and it was plenty. Maybe mini chips would be nice little flecks throughout the batter but regular sized ones were too big to use the full amount called for, imho. Definitely keeping this on file for those crazy days only chocolate can fix! ;) Very quick to mix up, too!

MADE THIS FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER AT THE IN LAWS. IT WAS A HUGE HIT. WHEN WE GOT ABOUT HALFWAY HOME I REALIZED WE DID NOT TAKE WHAT WAS LEFT OVER, AND MY HUSBAND SAID; DAD PERFERRED FOR IT NOT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE! GUESS THAT MEANS HE REALLY LIKED IT. WONDERFUL RECIPE; MADE AS DIRECTED, HOWEVER I DID HAVE TO BAKE FOR ABOUT 15 MORE MINUTES. I MADE IT AS A BUNDT, TOPPED IT WITH THE CHOCOLATE GLAZE FROM THIS SITE. I WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN.

This cake was so moist! It didn't really NEED a glaze but I added the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site and it was perfect. I used 3/4 cup of oil and completely forgot to add the chips until I had already put it in the oven. Oops! I'm sure it would have been even better with more chocolate (because really, there is no such thing as too much chocolate, right?)My family gobbled this up Christmas Eve and pretty much ignored the other desserts!

I made this for extended family at our annual Christmas gift exchange in early December.  I followed the recipe exactly and the chocolate lovers said I could make it every year from now on......LOL  My aunt asked for the recipe and took it to the monthly senior's luncheon at church the next week and it received rave reviews there also.  Thank you for a very moist chocolate bundt cake recipe.

UPDATE - took this cake to family reunion last Sunday........disappeared!  This time I used the mini morsels and I liked the texture of the cake much better......just lightly sifted powdered sugar over the top and it was so yummy I had a piece myself and I can usually resist chocolate cake.

12 month UPDATE - I have made this cake at least 4 times this year.  Everyone loves it because it is super moist....2 months ago I had 5 slices left after a summer potluck.  I put them in a bag, stuck them in in the freezer and then forgot about them until my husband was asking about dessert one night.  I took them out, let them defrost for about 30 minutes, zapped in the microwave for 15 seconds and they were warm, gooey and just as wonderful as they were when first made.  I think I will try a different version for my aunt's Christmas party this year.

Have made this 3x in recent weeks.  Last version had half chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips.  Very good!!  I do agree that you could cut down on the oil as the last one was a little overdone on the outer edge...but it's so tasty nobody minded.  A quick recipe with great rave producing results.

This is such a good recipe and simple to make.  A co-worker first made it for an office birthday and I woke up the next morning thinking to myself "Why didn't I take another piece for today!!!".   So I decided to make it this weekend for my Dad's and Sister's birthday celebration.   It was as good as I remembered...but I still didn't get any leftovers.  Sure could go for another piece right now! ;)

Wonderful! If you don't have sour cream, you can sub plain Greek yogurt and it works great. I was worried this wouldn't have time to cool and would either crumble to pieces or stick to the pan's edges when turned over - I was baking it for a party and had less than an hour after taking it from the oven to let it cool before needing to leave. But, I generously greased my pan, generously dusted with powdered cocoa and put the cake in the fridge after baking to cool faster. When it was time to turn it over, the pan was still warm and I was nervous but, the cake slid out beautifully. Very moist and rich!

Just made this & hubby & I are already on our 2nd piece! Incredibly delicious & super easy to make. Followed recipe to a T, except; substituted strong coffee for the water & used only 3/4 c. of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.

With all the five star ratings, I had high expectations when I made this for my dad's birthday.  It's nowhere near as moist as a typical wacky cake or one-bowl chocolate cake from scratch recipe. There were lots of unfinished pieces of cake, including mine and I ALWAYS finish my cake! No one asked to take home a piece, and I dumped the leftovers in the compost next morning.  Too bad because it was actually more effort than my usual from scratch recipe since I had to go out and buy cake and pudding mixes rather than using basic staple ingredients.  It's back to scratch for me!

I really liked this cake.  Its so sweet it doesn't need any frosting to me.  The only change I made was I added one cup of chopped walnuts.  I did this because I really love nuts with chocolate.

This is the second time making this, after reading previous reviews I cut oil to 1/2 cup and only 1 cup of chocolate chips and it came out wonderful, my health nut boyfriend who rarely eats sweets much less chocolate even asked for a double serving... next time I'm getting the chocolate mint chips... can't wait!!!

To be a too much chocolate cake, it has to have a richness that only a true too much chocolate cake can have. This, I felt was missing the mark. Perhaps it was the cake mix I chose, but even so, I was very disappointed with it. I could sense the flavor of the sour cream, although couldn't distinctly taste it. Definitely needs frosting to up the ante of the cake. Will need to add the frosting to mine before finishing it. Goes well with a glass of milk.

Very chocolaty satisfied the craving but overall just average. Was disappointed in the texture, expected it to be moister. Was relatively expensive to make ($8.00 plus $4.00 for choc ganache). I have chocolate cake recipes I like better.

Since I found this recipe on here I have made it several times. My dad asks for it almost every Sunday for dessert. I have changed a couple of things. I use a Betty Crocker Butter recipe Chocolate Cake mix and a smaller box of pudding, Hersheys brand. It disappears quickly! A new family favorite!

Needed to make dessert for special dinner.  Didn't have time for a "refrigerate for 4 hours" or "the night before" type of recipe.  

Followed recipe exactly.  Dusted with powdered sugar.  Served slices with homemade whipped cream, a spring of mint, and a few raspberries.  It tasted great and presented beautifully.

This is just a great cake; it is constantly requested and goes immediately. Do not make any changes; follow the recipe as written and enjoy not only the cake but the compliments. I used mini morsels because I did want them to melt completely (preference of mine, and not a change to the recipe).

I have baked this cake four times already. Once at Halloween (made two cakes and stacked them to make a pumpkin,) and twice around Christmas time. I made the cake in mini loaf pans and gave it as gifts and sold some of them in a bake sale. The last time I made it for a family get together, I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website on top. It was to die for! Absolutely recommend!

I have made this many times and each time get rave reviews. I follow the recipe as stated but cut back on the oil to anywhere from a 1/2 cuo to 3/4 cup and I always use Greek yogurt in place in the sour cream. This has been a cake that my sons frequently ask me to make. I usually always bake a cake from scratch.

OMG OMG OMG This cake is WONDERFUL. But I disagree with the title of this recipe. There is NOT TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE! It is the perfect amount.

VERY rich, decadent cake. I used the Shiny Chocolate Glaze and chocolate chips to top it and it turned out exactly as I'd hoped. I had my doubts at first because the cake batter was SO thick, but it was delicious and looked fabulous too!

Have made this twice now and got raves each times. Once froze it wrapped in foil for camping and it thawed moist and delicious. Perfect for the chocolate lover. :-)

I made a healthier version of the cake, using fat free sour cream, apple sause instead of oil, and only 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I think it came out better than the original version. When I made the cake itself, I used a 10" round pan and I used a baker's spray to grease the pan. It was a combination of grease and flour.

I didn't want to use a box cake mix so I made the devil cake mix from scratch and followed the rest of this recipe. Delicious! Not a single piece left. Next time, however, I will add less oil and milk/water mixture as other reviews have recommended.

I have been using this site for years and never left a review.  This cake is ALWAYS a hit.  I use mini chocolate chips and the chocolate ganache found here or just dust with powdered sugar if I run out of time.  My co-workers request this for every pot luck now.  Thank you for posting!

This is my go to chocolate cake for years! This is so moist and chocolates. I highly recommend splurging and using Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate chips and it will taste better than a bakery. For the ganache I use 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and another pack of Ghirardelli baking chips.

I made this tonight for a dear friends birthday.  I followed the original recipe and it turned out amazing!  I embellished it with strawberries.  I "cheated" on the frosting, using a store can of frosting and warming in the microwave and the drizzling over the top....It was amazing!
I was a little taken aback when it did not pour out of the mixing bowl and I had to spoon it in the pan, but it was perfect!

This was a very moist and tasty chocolate cake.  The only thing that we changed was I poured a chocolate ganache over the completed cake.  It came out wonderful.  Great for us chocolate lovers out there.

Followed each step exactly with one exception. Only used 3/4 cup of oil. It was AMAZING!!! I also followed the exact recipe for the Satiny Chocolate Glaze. The cake didn't even last 24 hours at my house. Can't wait for another excuse to make it. YUM YUM YUM!!!!!

I loved it!!! I made it for a house full of chocolate lovers, exactly as the recipe said, and everyone loved it. It's much like a brownie cake. I didn't even need to frost it. I didn't have a bundt pan so I baked it in a 9x13 instead and baked on 350 for 45 minutes and it cooked just fine all the way through. I will be making this again for sure!

question! I've made this a few times and LOVE it, but I'm going to a party where there are a few people who don't like chocolate (weirdos), so I'm wondering has anyone made this with vanilla cake mix and vanilla pudding mix??! And if yes or no, thoughts?!?! If I make it, I will post my thoughts. Also, how would I adjust baking time if I wanted to do cupcakes???

I followed the recipe exact, except that I only had 3.9 oz. chocolate pudding box, so I used 1 1/2 boxes more or less....
and I used 1 package of 12 oz. Nestle mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. It measured out to 2 cups. I baked in a regular round cake pan and made cupcakes. These were chocolatey and moist! they tasted ok.



*Update*
I made this again a few days ago and used Super Moist Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix by Betty Crocker. This cake mix already had mini mini chocolate chips and used 3.9 oz. pudding mix.
I lightly frosted it with chocolate frosting and then put crumbled cake on top and a cherry pie filling/topping  on top.
They were so moist and delicious!!!!!

So easy and so good.  Moist and loaded with chocolate...but not sweet sweet!  I made a glazed icing with chocolate milk, icing sugar and butter.  Make holes in the cake with a toothpick and drizzle over the cake.  Served with French vanilla icecream.  Mmmmmmmmm

This one is definitely a "bake and take" for the Church or Office lunch. Really easy to put together. Turns out the oven here is a bit fast so the cake came out a touch drier than I would have preferred; used the correct baking time. I'll ratchet back the oven time a little bit and see if that improves things. By the way, using the mini-chocolate pieces makes great sense. Didn't have any problems with the amount of oil and the cake fell out of the bundt pan after it was cooled completely. Enjoy.

I made this for my daughter Isabella's 12 birthday and it was a huge hit! The only thing I changed was I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. everyone loved it, except my picky daughter, she didnt like the chocolate chips in it, they didnt melt into the mix.

PERFECT! Just made it for my daughters third birthday and it was a hit! The kids will be up all night with that sugar high! Totally decadent, used the advice of putting circles of wax paper in the bottom and had no problems what so ever. Thanks for the great recipe.

I have a recipe that is very similar, with no oil and a teaspoon of almond exstract,which is a surprise to some that can't quite figure it out, but they love it!  This has become my "go to" cake.

I subbed all the oil with applesauce - don't do it! Texture was kind of gummy. The cake was still okay, but would've been better if I had followed the recipe!
EDIT: Made the again the correct way, and with full fat everything. Tasted a little too greasy initially, but once it cooled off completely (like it was supposed to!) it was very good.

This was really good. I made this for my boyfriends birthday. I was one of the best chocolate cakes I've had. It was really rich the day off and the next day had kind of like a brownie taste to it. I would definitely suggest it. I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was great

I am not a big cake fan, and even less a fan of boxed cake/pudding, but I had to bring a dessert to someone's house and thought the kids would like this more than a pie, cheesecake, or crisp.  It was very good!  It was nice and moist.  I added the Satiny Chocolate Glaze also from the site and a dusting of powdered sugar.  I will add this to the recipe box for the next time I need an easy and delicious cake.

This cake was wonderful. I made it for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. I had planned so many activities for his bday, so I was in a time crunch. Normally I like to make things from scratch, but I didn't have a lot of time. After reading all the reviews, I thought this would be a good "semi-homemade" cake recipe. And it was fabulous! Everyone loved it! Very moist and oh so chocolately! I will definately make this again!

Love, love, love this cake. It is my go to dessert for special occasions. I have used both instant pudding and regular slow cook or whatever you call it pudding and it tastes the same to me. It is decadent and a must for chocolate lovers. It is so moist and rich and best of all so easy to make. You will look like a chocolate super star when you serve this.

I wish I could give this cake more than 5 stars. It was the best chocolate cake that I've had in a long time, and unbelievably easy to make. Like other reviewers, I was worried that the cake would get dry, so I baked at 350 for 30 minutes, and then for another 22 minutes, the oven was at about 330-340 (just a notch lower). Came out perfectly!

Decided to go with this recipe for my Mom's b-day cake based on all the positive reviews, and it was a complete hit!  I was concerned it was going to be too chocolatey or 'cheap' given it wasn't from scratch but thought so many positive reviews couldn't be wrong.... I used 3/4 cup of oil, low fat sour cream and cut up 1 1/2 cups of chocolate that my Mom loves instead of using chocolate chips and it was fantastic. Next time I might use 1/2 cup of oil but not a big change I'm sure.  Given the name my company were all a little concerned it was going to be too sweet and only took a small slice but everyone said it wasn't and was actually one of if not the best chocolate cakes they've had and asked for seconds. :) I topped it with my friend's Mother's fluffy chocolate butter icing and provided a choice of whipped cream or ice cream. :)

This was very easy to make, came out very moist and could be eaten solo.  I did have banana pudding as a side item, and I'm sure ice cream or whipped cream would compliment as well.

I tried this and OMG it is the best cake I have ever tasted. I didn't make it as a Bundt cake instead I did a two layer cake with chocolate frosting and it was amazing! Everyone should be able to try this at least once in their life.

Made this exactly as the recipe is written.  It has become a favorite in my house.  I slice strawberries very thin and place them around the bottom of the cake before serving.  This is the cake my 6 year old asked for his birthday cake!  YUMMY!!!

I could not find any 18.25 ounce box of cake mix in the store. The Duncan Hines Devils' Food cake mix I used contains 16.5 ozs. So, should I reduce the amounts of sour cream, eggs, pudding, chocolate chips, etc? and if so how much reduced.  Also, should one follow the directions on the box of cake mix, blending 2 minutes on medium as directed on box, or just mix as recommended in the instructions and don't worry about the 2 minute mixing.  More specific recipe instruction should be provided.

Easy and Awesome.. crowd pleaser!  Make sure you make a chocolate ganache for the top (so easy and makes the cake way more presentable).

I never bake cakes but I received a lot of compliments.

This cake is delicious! I followed the directions to a T and it was perfect, the batter wasn't thin and the cake was very moist. Everyone loved it, my 6 year old to my 80 year old grandma. The only people who won't like this cake are people who don't like chocolate.

This was great! I made it with a gluten free devil's food cake mix and it turned out perfectly. Nobody could even tell it was gluten free! I made them into cupcakes and topped with caramel icing... delicious!! This is now the only chocolate cake recipe I use!

If you like chocolate you will love this quick and easy cake.  It is yummy with a fudge icing or with sliced sweetened strawberries served on the side.

I really don't understand where all the high ratings come from on this recipe. This cake doesn't taste any different from a (bad) box cake but it takes three times longer to gather the ingredients and make. I would rather spend more time on a delicious cake - or less time on a decent box cake.

Definately a 5 star recipe just as it is.  The chocolate chips is what really makes it yummy!  Serve warm for the best compliments!

Wonderful for chocolate lovers!  I used mini chocolate chips to keep them from sinking.  Very moist, rich cake that's perfect with vanilla ice cream.

this will be the second time I make this cake. I made it last time and thought I messed it up. I used vanilla pudding and added some cocoa. i added half cup flour to offset the extra moisture. Everything else I did according to the recipe except I took it out fifteen minutes early because I thought it was burning. It was one of the best cakes I ever had. And I had a lot of cake. this time I don't have a full cup of vegetable oil so I used the rest of my butter melted and used apple sauce to top it off. I have used all separately but never together. My guess is it will work fabulously. It better it is my birthday cake and it's ten o'clock at night. I am gonna top it off with a chocolate ganache this time.

Rich & delicious! Cake comes out perfectly baked (flat on top) so it's east frost. If instant pudding is not avail used pre-made. I cut chips down to 1cup as it seemed to b quite chocolatey.

Got more compliments the 2nd time I made it n cut the pudding out. Maybe 3 types of choco is just too rich for many people's taste. 

Overall this will b my choco cake recipe of choice!!

I think I was expecting something a little denser. It's very spongy. I asked my 2 1/2 yr old daughter if she liked the cake and she said no. Sigh...

This was a big hit! I did use viewers tips and changed some things..I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix, with 1/2 cup veg. oil and 1/3 cup milk (to help with the batter consistency), and 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and followed the rest of the ingredients. will make this again real soon!

OMG. Chocolate heaven. My son found this recipe for me to make for his 12th birthday (he knows where to look:). We frosted it with sour cream frosting (his choice) and it was the most amazing chocolate cake I ever made.

When my family gets a craving for chocolate, this is the cake we make. The only change I made was to use 2 eggs instead of 4. It comes out perfect everytime. I love it warm with a dollop of whipped cream. I would like to try this as a fat free recipe and see how it turns out. Try it you won't be dissapointed.

I have now made this cake twice, and it is amazing! I make it in 2 8" round pans and fill and frost it with chocolate mousse. The cakes bake up nice and flat for easy stacking and it is super moist and chocolaty.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made cupcakes out of it and they came out rich and moist. They were definitely chocolaty but not in a bad way. The only thing I changed was that I used mini chocolate chips because they  melt a lot better and they don't sink to the bottom.

This was amazing, and it didn't need frosting.  I was worried about the rich batter rising correctly because my elevation is 6100 ft so I made the following high altitude adjustments: add 1/4 cup flour to dry ingredients and 1/4 cup water to the wet ingredients when mixing.  Made with high altitude adjustments and baked in a bundt pan, cooking time was 50 to 55 minutes at 340 degrees.

I made this the other day and it was very moist, and so easy to fix. I did use other sujestions and used mini chocolate chip. The cake was a big hit with the guys at my Boyfriends coffee club. Do grease and flour your pan very well. A keeper for sure. 18.25 cake mix has been down sized and so has the 5.9 oz. of instant pudding. This is my second time making it and this time I made a peanut butter glaze to go on top then toasted some cocconut to put on it. Awsome.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had! It's worth the five star rating because you don't have to change the recipe at all to get a perfect cake.

Perfect! So moist and not too dense although the full cup of oil may lead to that expectation. I used vanilla pudding because that's what I had on hand and no chocolate chips, it was just the right amount of sweet to be topped with homemade peppermint buttercream! I plan on trying the recipe with different flavors of cake and pudding like butterscotch or lemon.

I found a peanut butter filing to go with this cake I have made this cake a lot because my hubby loves chocolate well I made a peanut butter butter cream frosting and made holes in the cake and piped the frosting in it and flipped it out so you could not see where I injected the frosting into it and then mixed the peanut butter butter cream with chocolate frosting and made a swirl out of it and well it was a great hit he took it to work and the guys want me to make another one because they loved it

Such a decadant cake.  I would use mini chocolate chips as the regular ones seemed to sink to the bottom and caused the top of the cake to be heavy from the layer of the chocolate chips ( not all had melted).  Goes perfect with chocolate genache if you want a chocolate overdose!

I made this for Christmas dinner dessert. I followed the recipe exactly. I sprinkled powered sugar on top. It has a good taste, but it's really oily. Next time, I think I'll substitute some unsweetened applesauce for at least half of the oil. I also think I will use a cream cheese frosting of some type. 
I was worried about it deflating from over mixing (based on comments), but I watched the video and followed it using my KitchenAid mixer. I let it cool completely. No deflating at all.

Best cake ever! I can't believe something this delicious came from boxes. I made it for Christmas Eve and everyone LOVED it... so moist and rich. I used mini chocolate chips as recommended by others so that they stayed incorporated throughout the cake during baking. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe, Denise!

I found this receipe on here and thought I would try it for my daughters bake sale because it was soooo easy!  I made 3 of them and had all 3 buyers call me for the receipe.  Of course then I had to make one for me and my family to see what we were missing out on.  One word...DELICIOUS!!!  I make it for EVERY occasion now.  I would defiently give this 5 STARS!!!  I don't bake much and this is soooo easy.  The only thing I changed was using small chocolate chips instead of the regular size!

This cake was excellent....Unbelievably easy.  I needed a cake for a co-workers birthday and had little time to prepare (but didn't want to purchase).  I whipped this up and no time.  Everyone loved it....even the coworker that cut into it before we sang! :-)

Awesome!  I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and cut down the oil to 1/2 cup and also used Lowfat sour cream...still came out moist with a perfect crumb! Eaten by all on Thanksgiving...no Pumpkin Pie for us.

Followed the recipe.  I had to cook it for longer than it listed because it was still watery when the time was up.  I then overcooked it a little bit because it was a little dry, but the taste was good.

You can never have too much chocolate! Baked this today (for my bday) in two 8" rounds and it came out PERFECT! 35-40ish min at 350 did the trick. I cut the oil in 1/2 as other reviewers suggested, next time I will use 3/4 cup. I also used Ghiradelli mini chips, which was excellent and distributed evenly throughout the batter, and frosted with a buttercream I added just a little cocoa powder to. My kids said "BEST CAKE EVER"!

I am CONSTANTLY getting requests for this cake. Serve this cake, warmed, on a drizzle of hot fudge with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It's the closest you'll get to heaven on earth besides a maternity ward. (after the babies are born of course lol)

This was a GREAT cake! Everyone loved it at thanksgiving. I made the basic chocolate cake part from scratch instead of using a box and then added the other things. I made a chocolate drizzle for the top using some recipe on here I forgot to save (it called for corn syrup and I used raw honey instead- turned out wonderful too)and it turned into one pretty cake. I will be using this recipe anytime I need a chocolate cake, whether using a box mix or making my own. Thanks for posting it!

Found this recipe last minute. I was a little unsure as I’ve always made cakes from scratch and against boxed mixes. However, made this and It was absolutely delicious, so moist and defiantly To Much Chocolate which I love!! 
Everyone couldn’t stop talking about how yummy it was, will be sure to make again. I had read a few comments and used the Chocolate Frosting which was perfect. YUMMO Thanks for sharing this!!!

Made this for Thanksgiving.  Bunch of desserts were there so everyone was taking little pieces so they could try them all.  Kept overhearing (again and again!!) "have you tried the chocolate cake?".  When folks went back for their "real" sized dessert, almost ALL went for the chico cake.  It was that good!!!!!

My cousins always rave about this chocolate cake my aunt makes so I was really excited to try it when she brought it to thanksgiving dinner tonight. It was the best chocolate cake EVER. As soon as I came him from dinner I sat down and looked up this recipe. Now I know what I'm bringing to every dinner I'm asked to bring something to. Delicious.

I'm making this recipe for the 3rd time in the last 2 months. It's amazing. I made it for two birthday celebrations and thanksgiving. You wouldn't even know that half of it comes from a box. AMAZING . I follow the recipe as is. Sometimes I serve it with vanilla ice cream or fresh raspberries.

This cake is great just the way it is. I have made it twice now and used the mini choc chips turned out perfect both times. Very rich and moist cake. Tried it with cream cheese frosting and it was good but almost too much the cake really doesnt need frosting so a glaze would probably be better. Whole family loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly and received many compliments on how moist the cake was. Definitely will make again! We used chocolate frosting that had little tiny chocolate chips on it as well. Huge hit!

In my opinion this cake is far too wet/ mushy when done. It is much better when you leave out the sour cream.

I'm not sure if you can ever have too much chocolate :)  I did think this recipe was fantastic, but then again, I love chocolate! It is rich and delicious just as any "too much chocolate" recipe should be!

I love chocolate cake and usually can only eat a small slice since they are always so sweet, this cake is perfect! Very moist chocolaty and hate to admit I can eat more than one piece. I did add a chocolate glaze thinking it would need frosting, that I will not add next time. Great with coffee!  Great hit with the family and they are begging for me to make again.

I loved this cake, but found that 2 cups of chocolate chips was too much for me. Used one cup instead and served with canned pears. So good!

This is the only cake I will ever make. Frosted it with "Browned Butter, Bourbon & Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site, and then topped it with some cinnamon whipped cream. Divine!

If you love chocolate, you will absolutely LOVE this cake! Every time I make this cake I get SO many compliments.  It's moist and rich and full of flavor. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe (on this site), and it is even more amazing! Thank you for this recpe!

This is undoubtedly the best, richest, chocolate cake I have ever eaten.  I had to bake an additional 15 minutes because of the morsels.  May reduce the morsels the next time to 8 oz.  Also may reduce the oil, but it was raved by all.

This cake was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out moist and delicious. I prefer regular chocolate chips -- they did not quite melt so added a little texture to the cake. I frosted it with homemade chocolate butter cream icing -- awesome!

SO YUMMY!! I made this exactly as it said to.  Very moist...definately sweet.  Instead of glazing or icing it it topped it with real whipped cream (very lightly sweetened) and covered the whipped cream with sweetened shredded coconut.  AMAZING!  It tasted like a mounds bar...covered in whipped cream...oh yeah!  DELISH!

This cake was...POW...BOOM...BANG!!! Very very very rich! Everyone loved it!  I would recommend using a 1/2 cup of oil as the cake took a longer tomie to cook thoroughly.  But, it was FANTASTIC!!!  Thank you for sharing!

I made these as cupcakes and they came out perfect.  I did use the mini chips.  They are very sweet, so I dusted them lightly with powdered sugar.  They are so moist, too.

I have used this recipe for years - it is a very good cake as is, but I have found that reducing the oil to 3/4 cup is much better, especially if making cupcakes.   It is just too heavy and "wet" when using the full cup.   I also use this recipe as a base for other flavors - I leave out the chocolate chips and use any combination of cake mix and pudding for a variety of flavors.  It is definitely my "go-to" recipe for cupcakes.

made this twice in the last week for my husband's birthday, with the glaze from this site recommended by other reviews, and sub'ed half of the oil for applesauce, which turned out perfect! next time i'll probably try all applesauce, just so i can eat two slices of this fudge-like cake with a big glass of cold milk with a smidge less guilt! i added a dash of cinnamon and the mini chocolate chips, as well, which i loved!!

Well, I may be in the minority here, but I wasn't impressed. I made this recipe twice, following the directions exactly each time and both times the cake, while not bad, tasted like a cake mix cake. I even tried different brands of cake mix and pudding mix-no change. Neither cake tasted especially rich, moist or chocolately. They were just ok-not bad tasting and adding chocolate chips to anything always helps. But I expected something much richer given the name. I will, however, fully vouch for the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site, which I used to top both cakes. Definitely not a traditional frosting, so don't expect something creamy, but a perfectly smooth, rich chocolate topping that is somewhere between a syrup and a full on frosting.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and it was a huge hit. THE best chocolate cake I've ever made. I didn't change a thing aside from making it into a 9x13 instead of a bundt cake. And I used a mocha frosting on it that completely complimented the taste of the cake. Wonderful recipe, I'll use it many more times.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it comes out perfect every time... I make it for potlucks and birthdays and everyone loves it!  I have also made it using vanilla cake mix and pudding with peanut butter chips and glaze, which is my mom's new favorite... I want to try chocolate with mint chips and vanilla with cherry as well.

Super easy to make! This came out delicious! I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze found on this site, but used dark chocolate and it was a huge hit at work! Thanks for sharing, this will certainly become a regular in my home.

This is the best chocolate cake out there. I have tried many recipes for chocolate cake but none of them come close to this one. I make a ganache icing for it just to make it look pretty. You really don't need to frost or ice this cake!

This is a great recipe.  I also cut the oil in half and used the glaze recipe suggested.  I was hosting a bird themed baby shower (theme was also used at the parent's wedding, this time there was baby bird in the nest). The bundt made a perfect shape for the nest and used shaved chocolate for the nest.  It was a hit.  Also found mini bundt cake pan and made mini nests with the bird cutouts that were used on the couple's wedding invitation (two glued together with a toothpick in the middle).  We are not a cake eating family and usually always have to throw most of the cake away days later, with this recipe both the cake and the mini bundt cakes were gone!!

This was soooo good! I don't have a bundt cake pan so I used a 9X13 pan. It still turned out wonderful. Think the bundt pan would be better though.

Used applesauce instead of oil, fat free sour cream, sugar free/fat free pudding mix and 12 ounces of semisweet mini chocolate chips instead of 16. Turned out great!

An amazing cake! I made two servings of it in a 9"x13" pan and put rasberry preserves between the two layers. So delicious! Everyone at my work loved the cake. I also used mini chocolate chips instead of regular sized ones that way they wouldn't sink, and I used half the oil. Came out just as delicious.

I  made this into a round 2-layer cake for my dad's birthday last weekend, and it turned out amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, and I found that 2 cups of chocolate chips in the batter was a bit too much -- it tasted great, but with a layer cake it was extremely tough to slice.  Next time I might cut that amount in half.  I made chocolate buttercream icing to top.  It was really delicious.  This one is a keeper for chocoholics. =)

This was so good and so easy!  I realized too late that my cake mix was around 14 oz but it was in the oven all ready.  Didn't matter - it was moist and perfect!

10 MINUTES IN THE OVEN AND I HAD TO RESTRAIN MYSELF AND MY 5 YR OLD!  YUM!!  I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN WE DOVE INTO IT .  I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE CAKE-LIKE...BUT THE NEXT DAY IT WAS DELISH!  VERY VERY MOIST AND HEAVY "CAKE"  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED BUT WILL LIKELY MAKE IT AGAIN.  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!

This is one of the most delicious chocolate cakes EVER.  Very, very moist, rich and intensely chocolate.  If you are a chocoholic (like me), you will love it.  And even though it uses a boxed mix, it tastes like it's made from scratch.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I was looking for a quick and easy chocolate cake recipe and came across this. Followed exactly as written and used mini chocolate chips as another reviewer had suggested. I also used store bought whipped icing that I warmed in the microwave for 20 seconds to drizzle over the top. I will be making this cake again for sure.

Excellent! Moist and flavorful, exactly what you want in a cake. The only complaint I have is the oiliness-- I make cupcakes more than cakes and so the oil completely soaked through the cupcake liners (even if I double lined them!). When I make the cake, I'll use the regular amount of oil, but if I make cupcakes, I'll try 3/4 cup to keep the greasiness down. I'll never use another chocolate cake recipe ever again!

I gave this a whirl yesterday. I followed the ingredient list almost to a tee except I had only bought one container of the pudding mix so I had about 25% of what the recipe calls for. That turned out to be a blessing in disguise since this cake is one heavy, rich mutha. My only other comment might have something to do with high altitude baking; I did add a few tbsp. of flour (because of our altitude) and I baked the cake for a full 55 minutes. It could have probably used maybe five additional minutes. All in all, this one's a keeper.

This is the most amazing chocolate cake I've ever made or eaten. I made it exactly as the recipe states (using mini chocolate chips). I used two round cake pans (35 minutes cook time) and then used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe as a filling between the two layers and covered the whole cake with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze. Everyone raved and said it's the best they've had.

I never liked chocolate cake, but my daughter asked for "brown cake" for her 3rd birthday... So I tried this and YUM! Chocalatey, moist, delicious. I did use mini chocolate chips as suggested and I am so happy with the results. Thank You for an awesome recipe!

Amazing!  I made cupcakes with it and got rave reviews!  My family has nicknamed them "World's Best Cupcakes"!  I don't remember how long I baked them for...I think I started them at 20 minutes and then kept checking for doneness.  I am going to try the recipe with vanilla cake and pudding and white chocolate chips this week.

the absolute best revised boxed chocolate cake ever!! I've made it about a dozen times and i frequently make it as a gift for friends who are sick. very easy and does not require any type of frosting. A must try!!
Note: when i first made this cake i accidently used the smaller instant pudding package. i think 3.9 instead of 5.9. between 1/2 and 3/4 cup of oil and 1/3 cup of milk. and ALL the chocolate chips (mini) fabulous! :)

This is a fabulous cake, really rich.  I didn't have a large enough bunt pan, so I made it in 9X13 glass pan and it was full!  I also used a chocolate frosting even though I'm sure it would have been great without it as well.  I'll definitely make this again.  I have a notebook with favorite recipes and this will be one of them.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever made, even if it is not quite from scratch. I have made it now three times, one of those times for my 14-year-old nephew's birthday and I received rave reviews. The birthday boy ate FOUR slices and kept repeating "man, this is so good, so good!!"
I did not change the recipe at all, however I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe calls for (maybe it's my oven, or the altitude)

One of the best chocolate cakes I've ever made!   Took longer than 55 minutes to bake (and that worried me), but the end product was delish!  Served with ice cream and our favorite hot fudge sauce from a local ice cream shop.  Perfect!

This is the best "doctored" cake I have EVER made... super rich and chocolately. It's perfect with raspberry sauce on top.

This is so good I would have it as my wedding cake.

Have used this recipe for years. I love to use espresso in place of the warm water!  Top with glaze and crushed chocolate covered coffee beans!  Decadent!

Made this for the second time as the first one was excellent - Only had sugar-free pudding- couldn't tell the difference.

The name says it all. As much as I love chocolate, this cake was about as much chocolate as I could stand. It was incredibly dense. I took some other reviewers' advice and lowered the temperature so it could cook longer without burning. If I hadn't done that, I believe it may not have cooked through and been burnt on the outside. I'm glad I tried it but I won't make it again.

I couldn't wait to make this cake after seeing all the great reviews.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  It just didn't do it for me.  It was good but not fantastic.

I made this cake for a party, and everyone said it was the best I ever made. If you need a super moist rich chocolate cake, this recipe is something you need to try.

very good as is! I made it for a birthday cake so I put into 2 9in round pans. The next time I think I will try it without the chips, I was the only one that wasn't too keen on biting into hard chocolate chips, no one else minded.

I loved this recipe.  The cake was so moist and stayed that way for 3 days, until we finished it.  I love chocolate, but my husband thought it was too rich.  Regardless, it you are craving chocolate cake, this recipe is the way to go.

Pretty good... I think I ended up baking it for an hour and 20 minutes.  Next time I may try with less oil as some have suggested.
I also baked in an convection oven at 325, still ended crispy on the outside and a toothpick never came out clean.  Still tasted good!!!

Our very favorite cake recipe -- we make it for every special occasion.  Only thing I do different is I use a dark chocolate cake mix.

This is so good! I always try the recipe as is with no changes first just to be sure to rate the recipe accordingly. This is a five star recipe as is. I have also made a "healthier" version with fat free sour cream and replaced the oil with applesauce, and used sugar free pudding and it is still a five star recipe! One time I followed another review and substituted coffee instead of the warm water and it is also delicious, but I prefer just using water. And defiantly top it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site!

This cake was EXCELLENT! and I can make it NON DAIRY!! I was looking for a new chocolate cake recipe to try, and I found this one. I was skeptical at first because I have never doctored a box cake and I was not sure how it would come out. This was awesome. I read others' reviews before I made it and decided to try the recipe as written. I had no problems with it at all. The only things I changed were that I used a dark chocolate fudge mix, canola oil instead of vegetable, coffee in for water, and a non dairy sour cream substitute since I can't eat dairy, but this was excellent! The fact that it is fast to assemble also was a huge plus! It is definitely a keeper and I will be sending it on through my recipe exchange. Yay for new favorite cake recipes!!! :)

Way too sweet!  Yes, it's delicious but the type of sweet that makes you feel sick.  Plus, it still has the box cake foundation that does not taste homemade.  For chocoholics this is probably a five but not for me.

I actually like this recipe its ok my kids love though. I would suggest adding the pudding at the end only because the batter is alot easier to handle(ur batter will get a pudding consistency)N also i've done this with the chocolate chips n without them n found that it taste alot better with them. I've also tried baking this batter in the mini muffin pans n its tough only because the batter is thick like pudding so u would have to spoon it into the cups. But regular baking pans are alot easier just spread out.

5 stars with the following changes-- -1 cup butter instead of vegetable oil -Used 1 cup milk w/ lemon since I didn't have sour cream -Used semi-sweet mini chocolate chips  -Used only 1/4 cup warm water  This recipe is excellent. I received rave reviews and was told that this was the best chocolate cake ever :)

Made this for christmas eve. I'm personally not a big chocolate fan but I had several people coming to my dinner, who were. So I tried this recipe due to the reviews. It was good but VERY rich & chocolatey. My chocolate loving niece said it was so good but she couldn't finish all of it, due to how rich it was. I topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site. Next time I might try a cream cheese topping? or another flavor to balance out all the chocolate going on.

This cake is like one giant Otis Spunkmeyer chocolate chocolate chip muffin.  It is so good.  I followed one reviewer with the chocolate glaze topping which made it perfect.  Absolutely loved it and it is soooooo easy to make.  Will definately be making this quite a bit in the future.  Thank you for the recipe.

I would give this a million stars if I could.  My husband is obsessed with this cake and everyone I make it for is in love with it.  It truly works with any combination of pudding/Chips.  I drizzle some melted chocolate and/or peanut butter on top when it is done and sprinkle powdered sugar to finish it off and it is perfection.  Easy and incredible. BEST CAKE EVER!!!!!,

I made it the "healthy" way as other reviewers had shared to cut down on calories. At first, it just tasted like normal chocolate cake, but after one day it tasted wonderful! I think you should make this cake in advance so the different ingredients have time to blend together. I added raspberries and chocolate icing:)

The name says it all.  It's a good cake but the density of it coupled with all the chocolate make it quite literally too much.  Glaze helped the texture but also added yet another element of chocolate.

Update: Made this w/a butter cake mix and a small package of instant vanilla with 1tsp vanilla extract added, left out the choco chips and frosted w/dark chocolate frosting, yum! Love how versatile the recipe is. I may try a german chocolate next, coconut in the batter sounds good :) 
Comes out very moist and rich, my family loves this cake. I like to dust the top off w/confectioners sugar, it's so sweet it doesn't need any frosting.  I use the mini chocolate chips since the chips do not melt. I'm always asked if I'm making this when I invite people to dinner. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly for a friend's birthday cake and it was delicious! Definitely intended for chocoholics though.  Took about 55 min - 1 hr to bake. Allow plenty of time to cool as instructed because it's very soft and hard to remove from the pan without breaking.  I made it in a cake pan instead of a bundt pan because I wanted to do a stencil on top with powdered sugar.  Be forewarned that if you use a regular cake pan, it needs to be bigger than 9 in. because the cake + pudding mixes make the cake rise a LOT.  I used a 9 in. pan and had enough batter left over for 12 cupcakes!  I wouldn't recommend using a glaze or it might be too sweet.  This was perfect with a dusting of powdered sugar. Everyone went back for seconds!

I wish I could give this cake more than 5 stars!! The only things I substituted were plain yogurt for sour cream and mini chips for the chocolate chips. I brought it to a poker night and people were sitting out rounds just to enjoy the cake!! Moist, delicious, slightly chewy outside, CHOCOLATE BOMB. So good! =]

I ended up using 1/2 c. oil and 1/3 c. milk. I also used coffee instead of water. It did take longer than I expected to bake though, I think it was in the oven for like 1 hr and 10 minutes or so. But I greased the pan with butter which I think helped in keeping it moist and gave it a nice buttery touch.

Take this cake to a special event.  It is AWESOME!!!  I have gotten so many complements every time I have made it.  You can dress it up many different ways by changing the frosting (dust with powdered sugar, drizzle a white frosting over is or put as much of your favorite chocolate frosting on it you want:)

This cake was so delicious! I made it as directed, and it came out perfect! As other reviewers have said, it is even better the next day.  I covered it with chocolate ganache with a hint of coffee and it was amazing!  It was so good that after making it for Thanksgiving for my family, I made a second one the next day to bring to my in-laws so they could try it too!

AMAZING!!!  This has become my go-to chocolate cake.  Like some other reviewers, i use mini chips, as they seem not to sink.  I also substitute unsweetened apple sauce for oil.  its so moist and delicious, everyone loves it.  I've done it as cupcakes, and have tried a good varity of toppings, including chocolate glaze, powdered sugar, mint chips (inside cake and on top), and caramel sauce w/rasberries.  hands down the most requested cake i make!

This is an amazing chocolate cake.  I used it for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I did not ice it or drizzle chocolate and it still was moist and rich.  I used sugar free chocolate pudding and sugar free chocolate cake mix.  Sugar eaters did not know the difference.  This recipe will definitely stay in my collection!

this cake was so good! i made this from my brother-in-law's birthday and everybody just loved it. i don't think it is "too much" - my dad commented that it wasn't too sweet and was perfect. came out super moist! i didn't have 2 cups of chips, but 1 1/4 cup seemed to be just fine. i did have to cook it a bit longer (closer to an hour). added white choc chips to fudge cake mix. i like that you can mix it up! used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site to frost.

Very good cake! The only variation I used was using mini chips which worked fine, not sure the difference between the standard chips though.  There are quite a few variations of this cake online and I am anxious to try out others, especially ones with less oil! I will say however that the rasberries I served with this really made the cake, I would not serve it without some sort of berry. Just in case, I had some chocolate sauce on the side, but it did not need it.

Turned out wonderful. Used 3 eggs instead. Topped with fudge and wedged chocolate covered strawberries around. Always add a second color besides having an all brown and boring cake.

This is by far the best chocolate cake recipe I've tried. (Especially with a Chocolate Fudge Frosting!).  I did only use 3/4 c oil since other said it didn't bake well with the full cup, but after seeing how it came out this time I don't think it would have been a problem; I will probably go for the full cup next time I make it.  I used regular chocolate chips (vs mini) and they were dispersed through the cake just fine and I do love those bits of melted chocolate throughout the cake! Would work as a great base to any topping.  It is really rich and a glass of milk along side may be necessary! :)

Sooo chocolately! If you love chocolate, this is one for you! I dusted mine with icing sugar and then drizzled it with melted white chocolate. It's filling, but so good!

I usually print the recipes, put them in a plastic sleeve, and add the date made on the plastic sleeve.  This recipe has 10 baking dates, and is simply a marvelous cake when made exactly by the recipe.  I usually use chocolate icing too, which makes it even better.  Thanks for all of the great recipes on this site, and for the comments and suggestions are quite helpful too.

Very simple to make, plus it's simple overall. Its just a light, moist, chocolately cake. I didnt put anything on mine but a lil dusting of powdered sugar. The perfect thing to have with a cup of milk.   I follwed the instructions perfectly and it came out perfect. No need to make adjustments.

Wonderful recipe.  I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  I made cupcakes on the 2nd time through, and they only had to bake about 22 min.  I hadn't had a problem with too much oil when baking in a Bundt pan, but there was definitely too much oil for the cupcakes, so next time I'll cut it in half.  It yields about 34 cupcakes, filled halfway.  I used strawberry cake mix, white choc. pudding and white choc. chips, and after removing from the oven I sprinkled about 10 white choc. chips on top of each cupcake, let them melt and then smeared them around.  Very good!

This was a HUGE hit and incredibly easy to make.  I used half the oil and topped the cake with the satiny chocolate glaze as others suggested and it was chocolate heaven!  Thank you for sharing!

I have used this recipe over and over again - it is so delicious! I can't even use the chocolate cake recipe I used to use anymore, it just doesn't even compare with the soft moist chocolaty-ness of this recipe! I generally make cupcakes, and top them with chocolate cream cheese frosting - blissful!

this is the best chocolate cake ever. however, every time i have made it, the edges have started to harden by the time the middle has set, and i have to cut off the lower outer rim/corner of each cake round. i've experimented with tweaking the temperature/cook time to avoid this but have not been successful. but this has not stopped me from making this cake many times!! most recently, i cut the cake rounds in half horizontally then layered with "Chocolate Torte" frosting (from the site) and sliced strawberries to make a monstrously rich, amazing 4 layered behemoth of a cake that was SO good even my boyfriend's friends (who hate me with a passion) couldn't help but compliment it :)

We live in NY and had a friend visiting this weekend. We visited numerous bakeries. I made this cake last night and he commented this ranked number 1!  You know it's a good cake when you don't need icing.

I made this for my friends birthday. I turned the mix into cupcakes, and it made 2 dozen. Everyone was saying how delicious they were. I can't have them, but I'd say with the look on everyones face they were a 5 star.

This is soooo good! It is really rich so if you don't like rich cakes this isn't for you. I recommend that you dust with powder sugar. Make sure that you grease your pan with Crisco and flour!

My husband made this for me for my birthday. It was AMAZING! Plus, the fact that he took the time to get online, find a recipe and then bake for me instead of taking the easy route by going out and buying a cake made it even more delicious!

I made this exactly as posted and it was a huge hit. I made cupcakes and frosted them with basic chocolate frosting (on the back of the Hershey's cocoa can) and took them to work. Everyone who had one asked for the recipe. This was on a Friday and by Tuesday I was scolded for not remembering to give out the recipe. Highly recommend to all the chocolate fans out there! Thank you for sharing!

This is my "go to" cake, my husband's favorite! It stays so moist and flavorful. Make sure you use instant pudding instead of the kind you cook. I set aside some of the chocolate chips and zap in the microwave in a ziploc bag for a few seconds. Then I snip a corner, and voila! Instant drizzle topping. I then sprinkle a little powdered sugar, and it turns into a fancy dessert.

This cake was definitely the easiest recipe I have made. I followed the directions as written and it turned out perfect. My cake was moist and the flavor was perfect. It was a bit too rich for me, but my fiancé LOVED it! I decided to a dark chocolate glaze and placed sliced peanut butter cups on top. This recipe is perfect for any chocoholic out there.

A favorite in my family.  It's always requested.  I dust with powered sugar and it can't be beat.  Easy too!

Simply perfect, just as it is. Have made about 20 of these since finding the recipe. I use cheapo pudding and chocolate chips and it makes no difference in the taste.  I melt about a 1/3 can of store-bought chocolate frosting (I know, the horror!) and melt it in the microwave, then pour over cooled cake as a glaze.  Lovely presentation... Also have used red velvet cake recipe a number of times, then used a cream cheese frosting glaze topped with a chocolate glaze (both store bought and the rest was used for something else...).  I've taken the red velvet cake with the black/white frosting to events and people go wild over the stunning presentation...

A true chocolate lovers dream. I have made this several times. It works best with mini chocolate chips. I think it tasted even better on the second day.

This cake was a big hit.  Not the healthiest of choices but it was a hit when I had a bunch of my husbands friends in from out of town.  I put peanut butter icing on it as well.  It was lucky to make it to Sunday.

It was good but not quite as good as I was expecting from the reviews. Overall a good desert, but I served it to a group of ladies I had over, and everyone seemed to like it, but no one really raved, or asked for the recipe like they usually do if they really like something.

Wonderful cake! I made this for my bookclub and it turned out great. I used a low-sugar devils food cake mix, sugar-free chocolate pudding and sugar-free chocolate chips. It was very moist and nobody could tell that it was low-sugar.

This cake is excellent. It was very moist and per previous reviews it tasted nothing like eggs. It was very rich and chocolatey. I made a chocolate buttercream frosting and microwaved it for about 10 seconds and poured it over the top. It was awesome. I have made it twice already and have gotten rave reviews each time!!! I made it exactly as written except I used miniature chocolate chips. I will definitely be making this again. I think next time I might try it in two 9 inch pans and put a filling in between. Yummy....

Nothing exceptional.  4 eggs was too many.  It tasted too much like eggs.  It was not moist but very much like any other box cake.  Will not make again.

Simply AMAZING!  I always use the mini chocolate chips and cover the cake after 40 minutes in the oven with foil so that the top (soon to be the bottom) of the cake remains moist.  Love this recipe!!!!!!

OMG! This is the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted! I did follow the suggestions by adding 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of milk because it made the batter easier to maneuver. If you are a chocolate lover then you have finally found a cake to satisfy your sweet tooth!

I make this cake all the time now. I have not had a bad review yet. One girl renamed it Death By Chocolate. It's wonderful just the way it is but I have made my own changes to it. I have used Special Dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet. I have also used a marble cake mix, vanilla pudding and caramel baking bits for one and lemon cake mix and lemon pudding for another. Tonight I am trying Andes Mints baking bits and Special Dark chocolate chips. To me, the possibilities are endless. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

This cake is easy, impressive and most of all, delicious.  I always drizzle the top with the Hard Chocolate Glaze and its ready to go!  When there isn't time to make a cake completely from scratch, this is my go-to cake for sure!

"TERRIFIC" I made this for my Chocolate Loving Daughters Birthday. The Family Loved it. They asked me to make it again the next week. So I did. I already had a triple fudge cake mix so I used that, still came out "GREAT".  Made 8 1/2" double layer with Satiny Chocolate Glaze by Ginger for the icing(doubled). Thanks for "AWESOME" recipe.

Made this cake and was wonderful...I also added walnuts and changed them to semi sweet white chocolate chips....and I followed Mrs. Possoms advice on half the oil and add milk. Served it with Vanilla Ice Cream scoop on top...Enjoy!!!

As with so many others, this cake got stellar reviews when I presented it as a birthday cake. Since I wasn't sure it was going to be chocolate-y enough :) I covered it with a dark chocolate ganache.

Very satisfying for chocolate lovers.  Easy to make.  I always use a bag of Nestle' semisweet chocolate CHUNKS instead and love it this way.  I also make a half recipe of homemade chocolate frosting to slather over top.

Very good. Used mini ch. chips as others suggested. Made into cupcakes...17-20 mins on 350..spread ch. frosting on while hot so it thinned out and soaked into the cupcake a little. Everyone in my house loved them.

OMG...this cake is so moist and yummy.  I can't beleive its made with a box mix.  The only alteration I made was, I substituted peanut butter chips in place of the chocolate chips.

This cake was good, but a little too much for me. I actually would've only rated it three stars, but my mother-in-law raved about it to all our co-workers so I upped it one. It has a dense brownie like texture that I was not expecting.  I baked this in two round cake pans, cut them each in half and layered the cake with the sturdy whipped cream frosting recipe and topped it with raspberry sauce recipe (both from this sight). The raspberry sauce really did amazing things for this cake and I highly recommend it.

SOOOO good! Took others' suggestions and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk. 3 eggs and 1 1/2 cup chocolate chips was enough for me. I baked it at 335 degrees for 50 min and it was nice and crisp on the outside, gooey chocolatey heaven on the inside. It was like a rich, fluffy brownie. Goes great with a cup of black coffee!

I have used this recipe so many times and it's ALWAYS a hit!  I've tried many different varieties of cake and pudding combinations-and I'm always told how moist and flavorful this cake is.  And because I tend to always have these ingredients on hand, I can whip this up pretty quickly-it is my go-to cake recipe.

I make this cake all the time.  It's always a hit with anyone that eats it (obviously, it's like a million calories, how could it not be delicious??)  The first time I made it, I made it as is, and it was perfect.  I have played around with the recipe over the years and tried some different stuff, like different pudding flavors etc.  My favorite alteration, however, is to sub butterscotch chips for the semi sweet.  Outstanding.  Highly recommend this monster of a cake!!

The hype is real. This cake is delicious, and SO easy to make. I took another reader's advice and used mini-choc. chips so that they would stay evenly distributed and not sink to the bottom like regular sized choc chips. My hubby LOVED the cake. He reheated slices in the microwave and said it tasted like molten lava cake in the middle.

Absolutely a great chocolate cake, I served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for my son's 25th birthday and it was great, the only problem I had was it stuck a little on one side of the bundt pan but I just scraped out that part and put it back together, no one even noticed.  I will grease my pan better next time and maybe flour too.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (I used mini chips and only about 1 cup), but made cupcakes (perfect @ 18 minutes). This is the first time in my life that my cupcakes were beautifully domed at the top. I piped on fluffy peanut butter icing from this site, and they looked and tasted AMAZING. I got a ton of compliments and had to stop myself from eating all 24.

I took previous reviews into consideration and only used a 1/2 cup of oil and man this cake was amazing.   I can see it from across my kitchen and let me tell you, I'm having to restrain myself from devouring the rest of it!!  I substituted chocolate fudge cake mix for the devils food mix and kept to the regular sized chocolate chips  and it was so good.

Very very yummy!  I've made this twice.  Once using the cup of oil and once with a cup of applesauce, and no one could tell the difference.  Save yourself the calories and use the apple sauce.  Everyone loves this.  It doesn't need frosting or glaze, its yummy as is, just dust with powdered sugar and its ready to go.  I find that it bakes perfectly in 45 minutes.  50 minutes is too long.  I use mini chocolate chips, it leaves it nice, moist and chocolately goodness.

I followed the recipe exactly, and got a great, moist, yummy, chocolate cake! I made the cake the night before, and the icing/strawberries the day of.  I drizzled chocolate glaze, added strawberries, and served it up to about 25 people who all had big smiles and told me that it was "soooo good!". To get all the ingredients for this and the Satiny Glaze Icing (http://tinyurl.com/26v26lx) was about $18.00 - which includes a small bottle of Kayro Light Corn Syrup, 1/2 dozen eggs, a small box of strawberries, plus all the other ingredients listed. I say this because it truly is a great cake, and definitely the best (semi) homemade chocolate cake I've had - but not the best cake in general (there is just something about truly made from scratch cakes that can't be beat).  My husband really liked it - he said it tasted like we could have bought the cake at a bakery and would have ended up paying WAY more for it!  And for that reason, and the fact that it is SO easy, I will definitely keep it in my recipe box for friends who love chocolate! I didn't know if it would end up being too chocolaty for some people at the bday party, so I added the strawberries, thinking that that would add some fruity relief.  I think it did (and who doesn't love chocolate and strawberries?!).   My hubby said that next time, nix the chocolate glaze because it might just be a little too much, but to try drizzling some raspberry sauce and sprinkling it with some powdered sugar - which I will definitely do.

It is what it is...  instant cake mix with added instant chocolate pudding.  My family ate it and the only comment was, "It tastes like instant chocolate mix cake."  Will not make it again.  Very dissapointing... specially when you have very high expectations.

Heaven!  The calories are worth it, this was delicious!  It was very moist and chocolatey, the chocolate chips were a perfect touch!  It seemed like the cake got better the next day, altough it only lasted 2 days!  I used milk chocolate chips instead, I don't know if it made a difference or not.

Didn't care for this cake at all.  Took it to a church potluck.  Had lots left over.  I love chocolate, but this was too much of a good thing.  Will not make this again.

Not my favorite but I'm picky. However, made it for a party where it was a huge hit hence the high rating. Made again substituting peanut butter chips for the chocolate which was also much appreciated. Made a simple icing from butter, sugar, chocolate, and cream. All in all this is a cake that is loved by many and very easy to make, especially in a time crunch.

Followed recipe exactly except I added only 1 1/2 cups of mini semi sweet chocolate chips.  Baked for 60 minutes.  Made satiny chocolate glaze from this site to drizzle on top.  Delicious!

My very first review in this site. This chocolate cake recipe as the BEST one I've tried. It's very moist. I've done it with chocolate ganache and easy chocolate frosting from this site but we prefer to eat it just by itself. My guys love it with a glass of milk. Thanks for sharing!

I used mini chocolate chips and baked it in a 9 by 13 pan, then topped it with a boiled peanut butter icing.  The resulting cake was irresistible and got even better as it sat- we finished it in 5 days and it was honestly tastier on the last day than the first.  The cake was very moist, dense and chocolaty, and the peanut butter flavor went with it beautifully.  I heartily recommend using peanut butter frosting (or a boiled peanut butter icing) on this.  Next time I'm actually going to try using yogurt instead of sour cream and cut way back on the oil (possibly subbing applesauce for some of it) because the amount of fat and calories in this cake is obscene, even if it is tasty!

this cake is amazing, and the only thing requested when we do pot luck at work! i make chocolate ganache and pour it over the cake once its cool, really puts it over the edge. if you know someone that loves chocolate, make them this cake!

This is a favorite recipe and always pleases. I have never had a problem using the amount of oil recommended. I use a silicone non stick bundt pan and that had the best results for getting it out and having it cook evenly.

these are absolutely wonderful!!! I usually read reviews first and was worried about the texture/consistency.  But did n't find that it was too thick, it reminded me of pudding.  I made exactly as recipe said...so good!!  I will make again.  I did make 24 cupcakes instead of bundt. baked for about 35-40min

everyone loved it! Update: just made this today with white chocolate chips and it was a greasy disaster. The chips fell to the bottom of the bunt pan holding onto the top half of the cake. I have a half cake sitting on my cake plate while the other half is glued into the cake pan. Do not use white chips.

This recipe was pretty simple and kept its shape in the bundt pan when removed.  However, I do not really care for cakes made with boxed mix.  They never have a really dense and rich taste like the homemade cakes. This cake had a lot of high reviews, so I thought it might be different.  But, it just tasted like spongy boxed cake mix with loads of chocolate chips.  It did not transform the ingredients into anything than what they were.

I made this tonight and though I haven't tried it yet, my boyfriend has and he loved it! He couldn't stop eating it (and he rarely has a sweet tooth) so that right there is enough for me to know that this one is definitely a keeper. The only change I made is that instead of a half cup of water I did a half cup of coffee. Great recipe thanks for posting!!!

I served this with our Mother's Day meal! DIVINE! After going through 100+ reviews, I only made 1 major change: used 1/2 cup oil instead of 1 cup. I used a Devil's Food Mix. Instead of chocolate chips, I cut up 3 large dark chocolate bars into 1/4"-1/2" pieces. (50% or higher cacao) The women in my family were oh so happy! I covered the cake in the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site. Rich and wonderful!

OMG!! This is a glass of milk cake.  You can't eat it without a glass of milk nearby.  My daughters told me that this is the best cake I have ever made.  Used light sour cream, not sure it makes a difference but figure every calorie counts.  Must have recipe!

This cake has the perfect name.  I think it does have too much chocolate!  Maybe I would cut the chocolate chips down to one cup. I'm on the fence with this one.  Probably won't make again.

I seldom use cake mixes but I wanted some quick and simple and chocolate for a birthday. It did not disappoint! After reading other reviews I cut the oil back to 3/4 cup and I used the mini chocolate chips. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top - glad I did - frosting would have too much.  My bundt pan is only 10 cups so I also had enough for 4 cupcakes. Very moist, very yummy!

This is a great " I don't have time to make a from scratch cake." It is very versitile. You are limited to what they have on the shelves, but the combinations of flavors are numerous. This is a dense cake, but it is very delicious. I will be making it again I'm sure.

WOW I've made this several times now and it turns out perfect every time! A powdered sugar topping is best because it is so rich already. Don't be afraid to try other flavors. I recently used a lemon cake mix and lemon pudding and white chocolate chips and then made a lemon glaze, it was out of this world!

I made this cake today, and followed the recipe to a tee.   It was just okay for us....my husband really likes it, but I thought it was so-so, and my nephews (teenage boys who normally eat everything in sight!) didn't even finish their pieces.  I probably won't make it again, as I don't see much of a difference between this and a box cake -- the end results are still pretty similar.

Excellent cake.  I followed previous suggestions to decrease amount of vegetable oil to 2/3 cup, and it is still very moist.  I made a salted caramel glaze for the cake, and the flavor combination was incredible!

This cake is so yummy!! Very rich so a little piece is good enough! The only changes I made was to use 1 box of devils food chocolate pudding mix & replacing the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips! Then I frosted it with fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site & it was to die for!!! The cake was soo moist & it tasted like a really good peanut butter cup mmm mm good with a big glass of milk!!!

This cake was delicious.  It was inexpensive and easy to make.  I did not use the mini chocolate chips but I liked seeing the chocolate chips in the cake.  Next time I may try and drizzle caramel topping on it.  I do recommend you try this.

This did not turn out quite as planned, but was still so so so good!  I would recommend to maybe put a smaller package of pudding in it if you don't want so much chocolate.

Very fast and moist cake, and so very, very chocolaty! Made it as the recipe was written and used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site on it. I took it to a party that had several other cakes served as well but this one was talked about by everybody! You know, one of those "fat head" moments!!

This cake was soo delicious. Even people who prefer vanilla cake loved this! I did use mini chocolate chips and they settled throughout the entire cake. This doesn't need any icing or glaze. It's perfect as is! Dusting with powdered sugar for presentation was all I did. I took this to a family party and everyone loved this more than store bought cake. I actually prefer this to brownies and I'm a brownie lover. The cake is rich and dense but so addicting. The chocolate chips are a delightful gooey surprise in this cake and the rich deep notes of chocolate are unforgettable.

So amazing! made as recipe stated. So far I have made it three times and I know I will make many more times. It does not need a frosting or icing but it certainly would not hurt if you felt the need to add one. so moist!

Love this cake!  I made it the first time exactly by the recipe...and it was awesome.  The next time, I ran out of oil and only used 1/2 cup vice 1 cup.  It still was just as good, so that's how I've been making it now.  I sometimes make it in a 9X13 inch pan if it's for a crowd.  Terrific recipe!!

If you need to impress your boss. . . . This is truly excellent.  I add 1-2 tablespoons of espresso granules or instant coffee.  I also use MINI chocolate chips.  The coffee heightens the flavor of the chocolate (you don't even taste the coffee).

This is scrumptious. Moist, chocolatey deliciousness. I made double recipe that produced a six-layer cake. Filled each layer with chocolate ganache and frosted the whole thing with buttercream. Amazing. You won't be worry. Well, I take that back. You might be sorry because you won't be able to stop eating this. Mmmm!

I made this exactly as written except I baked at 325 (my oven is a little off).  It came out perfect!  Very chocolately and moist.  I also topped it off with the chocolate ganache from this site as suggested by another viewer.  Delightful!

I loved this cake!  I made it for my boyfriend's mom for her birthday and he forgot 3 days in a row to bring it to her.  She said it was still delicious anyway!  I followed other's advice and only used 3/4 cup of oil.  Something else I  did to mix things up was use a yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, and white chocolate chips for a delicious vanilla version!

So good! I didn't have a bunt pan so I used a standard 9X13 and it turned out awesome! This was a HUGE hit and totally hits the spot on those "must have chocolate" days!! Thanks so much for sharing it!

This is the best chocolate cake ever and it is sooooooo easy to make. The family loved it and it served only for 2 days, I will definately make it again. A note though, I tested it with a knife and it came out wet after 55 mins, left it for another 10 mins and the top was a little burnt, I should have followed my husband and taken it out anyway.

OMG, Fabulous!  This cake is even good three days later. My husband likes to heat a slice in the microwave for about 10 seconds and then add a large scoop of vanilla ice cream. YUMMY!

I made this for my husbands birthday party and it was loved by all.  It is a very moist cake and so good by itself, there is no need to gussy it up.  I reduced the oil to 3/4 a cup and added 1/3 cup milk but otherwise followed the recipe.  I topped it with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and filled the center with fresh raspberries.  I will definately make this again!

I made this twice -- once for family birthday, and once for company.  It was wonderful both times!  I used 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup water as someone suggested.  I found the regular sized choc chips to work just fine though.  The batter is thick enough to keep them from sinking.  This is definitely a keeper.

I made this cake with one substitution (full fat plain goat yogurt instead of sour cream) and it turned out really well. Used a 9x13 pan and I accidentally set it on 375 for the first 30 minutes and then turned it down to 325 for another 12 minutes. The edges were a bit dark but the centre was still moist and delicious. The taste is great and I don't even think this cake needs any icing. I covered it in buttercream and fondant and made it even more sugar-coma inducing.

Extremely good chocolate cake for any season.  It stands alone served with only small bit of frozen yogurt or the chocolate icing.  Rich and beautiful.

This is an awesome recipe. Use the Satiny Chocolate Glaze, and it is a Chocolate Lovers Dream. I only use half of the oil and substitute the apple sauce for the other half.

Absolutely incredible cake! I baked it as a 3-layer cake with ganache topping and cherry-chocolate buttercream frosting between the layers, and I had people telling me that this cake was the first chocolate cake that they had EVER loved!

This is a delicious cake. I have made this ever since I found it in the "Cake Mix Doctor" for every occasion. It is my families favorite. I always take it to our family reunion and it is gone quickly. I don't add any powdered sugar or anything to the top, it is sweet enough as is. I always use my Wilton cathedral cake pan and it is always beautiful. If you love chocolate you have to try this one.

This has to been one of the best cake recipes I have ever tried.  Not only is it delish...it's easy too.  I used the satin glaze recipe from this site as one of the other users had suggested.  I then added a little bit of melted white chocolate drizzled over the top.  Not only was it a huge hit it was really pretty too.  I would suggest this to anyone!!!

Took this to a Lion's club potluck and WOW it was a hit. Didn't have much left to bring home. I made it according to directions and I thought it turned out perfectly. So easy to assemble. It gets 5 stars from me.

I used this chocolate cake recipe to make an ice cream cake for my boyfriend, and he loved it. So did everyone else that tried it. The only thing I changed about the recipe is that I used 3 large eggs and 3/4 cup of oil. I will use this recipe from now on when I make chocolate cake.

This was good, but not as good as I was hoping it'd be.  To me, chocolate cake mixes just aren't as good as homemade, but the extra ingredients did help.

I've made this cake twice already and each time, it is a hit! It is so delicious. Once the cake cools, the chocolate chips are still melted and it tastes like a molten chocolate cake. Yummy!!! I'm looking forward to the next event so I can make this cake again.

I wanted to submit a picture but before I could find the camera, half of it was gone! The chocolate chips melt inside and are like the frosting. Making my mouth water just thinking about it! I made it again a couple of days later and put it in 2 loaf pans to give away and everyone loved it.

Absolutely delicious!  I used the mini chocolate chips and fat free sour cream but didnt change anything else.  Going to be making it again for my daughters bday.  Going to cut down on the oil a bit since many seem to have tried this with success.  It is definitely a keeper recipe!

Delicious!  Made it with the mini chocolate chips as a review suggested and covered with the Satiny chocolate glaze.  I am looking for a reason to make it again in the near future, it was that good!!  Mine had to cook a bit longer than indicated, but I made up the time by cooling it in the refrigerator.  I found it even tastier on day 2 when the cake firmed up and the glaze really hardened.  It didn't make it past day two - too yummy!!  :)

Excellent dessert!  We served it with vanilla ice cream, and I made a chocolate glaze for the top.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This was a very good cake and stayed very moist, I just expected more of a chocolate pow then it gave.  I will say the longer it sat the better it got.

OMG the best cake in the world!!!!! So moist, I made just as the recipe calls for but I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix from HD.  I had to give it away to my neighbors before I ate the whole thing. Amazing warm with ice cream.  This will be my to go cake from now on. AMAZING

3/22/10 update: Made it again but got to taste it this time...Yum!! First time I made it I just sprinkled powdered sugar on top. This time I melted some chocolate with some creame to create a sauce to drizzle over it...delicious, nice looking and easy...what more can you ask for! :) ~~~ Made it for a friends birthday...didn't get to taste it as we dropped it off, but got rave reviews. Made it as directed with no variations. Have a feeling it would have gotten 5 stars if I'd have gotten to taste it, lol. :)

This cake was a disapointment after reading all great reviews. Some of the reviews were correct about baking time and hardened edges. It took me 1.5 hours to bake it and the edges were very hard. I think it depends on the oven you have. If you are baking it for the first time, don't try it for an event. Try the recipe first and then make any necessary adjustments for baking time and overn temperature. Good luck. I won't be trying this recipe again.

This cake was ok. I was expecting it to be better. The chocolate chips made it taste cheap. And it wasn't as moist as I thought it would be. I love using doctored cake recipes. But this one was not as good as the hype it receives. Going to continue to search for a great chocolate cake recipe. Might have to try scratch ones.

Very tasty! This cake will definitely take longer than indicated in some ovens, but when it's done (and topped with a satiny glaze) it's delicious.

HELP! hi everyone, i need some help, i want to bake this cake today but the ounce measurements are a but confusing. This cake sounds amazing and i want to get it right. 18.5 oz pack of devils food cake sounds extremely large to me when i convert it to grams (I'm from NZ) can some one tell me if this is a typo and what size packs they used in their recipes? (oz or grams) and lastly, in NZ instant pudding comes in a sachet and is about 70-75 grams (about 2 and a half ounces) this sort of instant pudding you add to milk and leave to set in the fridge, can someone PLEASE verify if this is the same type of instant pudding you have in the states or is it is something totally different which we have another name for, and could someone tell me the weight of the instant pudding they used in their recipe? PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME, I WANT TO MAKE A VALENTINES CAKE THAT IS TRUELY AMAZING! thanks anyone for any help you can give me

Ok..First off, this is probably getting 5 stars by so many people because it is kinda hard to mess up a box cake. So, keep in mind that it "is" a box cake, therefore if you generaly like box cakes, then you will probably give this a 4-5 star rating because of the few simple changes to make it a little better. It is a good cake. I will make it again with one change. Rather than coating the pan with oil, I will use Crisco non-stick Buterry Spray. I took one star away because this cake is similar to a pudding cake, and the recipe for the Thick'n Fudgey Tripple Chocolate Pudding Cake is amazingly better! I took another star away because of the oil taste on the outside of the cake.

Well, for someone that NEVER uses cake mixes, my 10 yr. old daughter coerced me into making this for her daddy's birthday.  We were NOT disappointed!!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE !!!!! this cake! It is the exact type of fudgy, dense, super chocolatey cake we were looking for!  We baked in 2  9 inch round pans, as we don't ahve a bundt pan.  It took about 1 hr. and 10 mins. and rose high above the edge-could have made a 4 layer cake!!  We followed recipe, except using 3/4 cup of oil.  Topped with Satiny chocolate glaze from this site and chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate curls, whipped cream AND Hershey's kisses for a superb presentation!! (remember, this is a 10 year old's idea; you can never have TOO much chocolate!!)  Will ABSOLUTLEY make this our go-to chocolate cake and throw the old recipe in the garbage!!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!

I made this for my son's teacher for Valentine's Day and it looked and smelled so yummie that I couldn't resist having a taste.  Needless to say I had to make a second cake the next day to take to his teacher.  The first time I baked this I followed the recipe exactly!!  Soo Sooo Good!!  The second time I turned the oven temp down to 330 because my oven cooks fast.  I aslo used mine chocolate chips like other reviewers suggested.  I didn't get a chance to taste the second cake but it sure looked good.  I will definitely make this again.  Yum Yum Yum

This is as amazing all the reviews stated! We used fat free/sugar free pudding as the only modification and you couldn't tell. We tried one of those castle silicon bundt pans and well it did not go well due to it drooping with the weight of the batter. I believe this is an issue with the pan not the batter being too heavy. Really one of the easiest and best cakes I have ever eaten.

OK, this is ridiculous.  This has got to be the best chocolate cake ever!  I made (as stated in recipe) using mini choc chips.  I baked in a bundt pan and sprinkle with powder sugar for a finished look.  If you like chocolate, you've got to try it.  Its wonderful.  I almost think frosting would be too much for this cake.  I might try it though ;)  Thank you Denise!
editing to add....I made this again a couple of times...I think I was brainwashed by all the reviews :)  .  It was just so greasy..I don't know why.  I think next time I will cut down the oil to 1/4 or so.  I just don't think the grease is necessary.

I will never ever make another chocolate cake recipe again!  This is the only recipe I will ever make!  It's chocolately, moist and just down right delicious.  This cake doesn't even require frosting but I used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe and it gave it such an added bonus.  After reading several reviews I altered a few things:  I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, reduced chocolate chips to 1 3/4 cups and I also added 1/3 cup milk.  This recipe is so incredibly easy and the best part is it appears you spent hours making it because it comes out so beautifully in a bundt pan.

Very Rich!  But wonderful!  You don't really need icing for this cake.  I did add peanut butter icing as a filling and for the top and then iced the sides with Chocolate Butter Cream!  WOW!!  It was so rich that I could barley finish my piece!  My fault for the overload of icing!  But others raved about it.  I will make the cake again and dust it with powdered sugar!!  Thanks!

I made this cake for an all church birthday party, were there were 11 other cakes and everybody loved this one, I did make some modifications, I used about 1 1/2 cups peanut butter chips and 1 cup of chocolate chip, with peanut butter frosting and drizzled with chocolate on top, it was amazing. It was rich and dense, everyone loved it.

I did not put any chocolate chips in the cake itself.  Added Chocolate covered stawberries with stripes of white chocolate.  My 7 year old also thought it was good enough for her birthday.

Ohhh my goodness. This cake was perfect! Moist, incredibly chocolatey, and beautiful to look at too. We made our cake with a package of instant chocolate fudge pudding instead of the traditional chocolate to give it a little extra kick of chocolate. Needless to say, it was divine. Incredibly easy recipe to boot

I am not much of a baker and was afraid of taking on a cake, but this recipe was super easy and turned out amazing!. I have made it twice in one week and everyone has been going on and on about how perfect it was. I sure it will not be long before i make this cake again. Thank you for such a great and easy recipe!

This cake was perfect. Made it exactly as recipe stated and it came out moist and as rich chocolaty goodness! Made it for some friends for their anniversary. Brought along a good port to sip with it. They said... "Better than Costco's chocolate bundt cake". Perfect dessert!!!

Great cake. Very moist. I put powdered sugar on top instead of frosting. It was plenty sweet enough.

Took this to a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it.  Baked it in a bundt pan and it baked up really nice.  Topped it with a little powdered sugar, chocolate sauce and fresh strawberries.  Then made homemade whipped cream to serve on top.  I would rate it 4 1/2 stars if I could.

I made this last night for a birthday at work.  This cake is honesty one of the best out there using a box mix.  It is super moist.  Very chocolaty!  I made it with mini chips and they melted perfectly.  I used a fudge glaze on top and garnished it with choc covered strawberries.  I highly recomend this for when you want that homemade cake that is easy and quick.  This will be a keeper in my cake recipe book.  Thanks for sharing :)

LOVE this recipe.  I will never make a plain chocolate cake from a box again.  It is so easy and sooo delicious.  I've used semi-sweet chocolate chips and also dark chocolate chips and both are good.  I use this recipe mostly to make cupcakes and it makes about 30, give or take.  The batter is spongy and easy to work with.  The cake comes out moist and rich.

This has been a family favorite for many years, I make it every time my mother-in-law visits.  The only difference is the water.  My mother's recipe called for a cup of black coffee (coffee already made, not grounds).  We serve with a creamy whipped topping.  Just to emphasize the chocolatey nature, we call it the "Chocolate Chocolate Cake".  Enjoy

This is an awesome cake!  It is so easy to make and soooo yummy!  I made it for my son's 2nd birthday.  Used a 9x13, followed the recipe exactly, baked it 45 minutes and that was perfect.  Cooled the cake for about 20 minutes, then microwaved a can of store bought icing 1 minute, stirred it really good and then poured over the cake and spread it around.  When it cooled it was like the chocolate glaze on a doughnut.  Everyone at the party absolutely loved this cake.  They actually couldn't believe that I had made it!  My children usually only eat the icing off of cakes and leave the cake part, but they ate every bite of this cake and asked for more.  Every time my 2 year old took a bite, he said "MMMMMM!"  Will definitely keep on making this cake!  Thanks for the recipe!

Every time I make this cake and serve it to guests, they all want the recipe. I can't believe how easy the recipe is - my 12 year old now makes it for me so I don't have to. The Satiny Chocolate Glaze is the perfect icing to drizzle over this cake. It is so moist and chocolaty but not too rich and dense. The perfect chocolate cake in my book!

I've made this recipe several times now, following it exactly. You can never have too much chocolate. This is the best cake I've ever had, and is delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I always reheat mine in the microwave for about 15 seconds. Amazing, thank you!

I made this cake for my boss's birthday.  It was a HUGE hit!  Everyone loved it and there wasn't a crumb left.  I dusted the top with confectioner's sugar instead of using the Satiny Chocolate Glaze like a few reviewers recommended and it was a perfect topping!  Didn't change a thing in the recipe.

This is definelty a chocolately cake.  I personally think it is a little too rich and a bit dense.  However, any chocolate fanatics dream, it is.

Fantastic! My only change was that I used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate :)

This cake is soooo good and soooo chocolately. I followed the recipe exactly and used the chocolate chunks in the batter. I'm glad I'm out of town this week, so I won't devour it! I topped it with a dark chocolate ganache from another recipe on this site.

This was so unique and delicious. I followed the recipe except I used 4 tsp flour.  Before our two guests arrived I measured out the ingredients and mixed the dry and liquid ingredients separately. Then I waited until we'd finished the main meal before mixing it all together and cooking it. Topped it with ice cream and a little toasted coconut. Everyone raved. I don't think I could make this for more than four people since it takes some time to turn out each little cake after it's finished cooking and put the ice cream on it - because the little custard dishes are so hot. The one thing I might change is trying to coat the cups with butter and sugar instead of flour. It would have been prettier, but I don't know if it would fall out as easily as it did with flour. But with ice cream on it, no one could tell.

This recipe is awesome! I've made it twice with slight modifications (used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and had to bake for about 1 hr 30 mins) and it came out perfect each time! I debated on adding the chantilly glaze as others have suggested but have been told (by several chocoholics) that it is moist and rich enough without glaze or frosting. The powdered sugar adds a nice presentation and subtle, off-setting sweetness that keeps this dessert simple yet surprisingly scrumptious!

Delicious, have made several times. Made with 1/2 c butter instead of oil (I like the flavor better), added 1/3 c milk for consistency. Can also use applesauce for oil is also good. Added, used coffee instead of water. Have used Ghiradelhi 60% chips , mini chips and health pieces, all delicious.

I made this recipe just as written.  It is excellent. It came out of the bundt pan like a dream.  It is so moist and chocolatey. I have made it using name-brand cake mix or store brand and there is no difference. Easy and yummy!

whoa. this was good. i'm usually wary about cake mixes, especially doctored ones, but this was wonderful. the sour cream gave it a little edge. i used a scant 1 cup of oil instead of the full amount, and it was still plenty moist. i dusted it with powdered sugar before drizzling chocolate glaze, in order to have some contrast. next time, i will try subbing strong coffee for the water, or just add some instant coffee granules.

I enjoyed the taste of the cake but really didn't think it was anything special. I felt I could've had the same results if I just added chocolate chips to any devils food cake mix without having to do more than that.

This was very good for a quick chocolate cake, but still says "I'm a cake mix from a box" in the end.  If you are pressed for time, this is a great choice, but nothing beats a Chocolate zucchini cake for a home made, super moist chocolate cake.

I was not impressed with this cake, which is weird because I LOVE chocolate. My family didn't give it rave reviews but they ate it. I followed the recipe exactly, but I'm wondering if maybe I'm doing something wrong because all of the other reviews are so great. I don't know. It was good, not great.

Awesome cake!  I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday and topped it with the 'One Minute Chocolate Icing' by Sandy from this site and it was a hit.  Definately a keeper.

The cake was moist, but I didn't personally like the chocolate chips in it.  I will try it again, but without the chips.

Sooo good!!  I had to bake this cake an extra 20 minutes??  My toothpicks kept coming out dirty... I don't know what the problem was there!!  I was pleasantly surprised to find that even after the long cooking time, the cake was still moist as ever!!  I topped it with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site.  Thanks Denise!!

The best chocolate cake I have ever made!  I added about 1 - 2 Tbs of cocoa, and 1 Tbs icing sugar, and increased the water to 2/3 cup.  This will be the only chocolate cake recipe I will use!  It is full of rich chocolate flavour, there is no need for icing.  The only improvement I would make would be to chop up the chocolate chips a bit; most of them melted into the cake, but there were a few that didn't and it didn't go well with the fluffy texture.

Sorry this cake was wwwaaayyyy too chocolatey!!!  Just so overpowering, I could hardly taste my vanilla buttercream frosting.  As for the texture, it's too dense for me, I like light, fluffy cake.  It is moist though.  I love chocolate cake, but this one is not for me.

This cake came out perfect, was delicious and is so easy, perfect for when you are in a pinch for time.  I sprinkled it w/ powdered sugar & served w/ vanilla ice cream to help soften the intense chocolate flavor!

The first time I made this I forgot the chocolate chips and it was still so moist and delicious.  I didn't even use the glaze so many mentioned.  The 2nd time I used the chips and they sunk to the bottom of the pan and caused some burning of the cake.  So either way it is a super easy and delicious recipe.

SUPER - Easy.  Made this for a board meeting - and it was gone.  Served it a bit warm and the chocolate was so gooey - everyone raved about it.  I did sprinkle powered sugar on top.  I do recommend waiting a full 1 1.5hr before trying to take it out of the pan... esp when it's warm.  I only waited an hr and it came out - but was hard to slice b/c it was still warm.

This was so moist and rich, it doesnt need icing, powder sugar is perfect. Just use your sifter or a strainer to apply powder sugar evenly.

I'm giving this a 4 because my husband and I didn't really like it, but my coworkers loved it. I only used half a cup of oil as others suggested and used a smaller box of pudding as I couldn't find a 5.9 oz box. The cake was rich and moist, but too chocolately for me.  You definitely need to be a chocolate lover to fully appreciate this cake!

I have looked and looked and looked for a recipe that is THIS MOIST and I have finally found it!!!!!  The cake stayed moist, almost wet in fact!  The only gripe I would have is that it does taste kind of oily (a trade-off for the moistness I suppose!), so next time I will try the 1/2 cup oil, 1/3 cup milk variation.  The glaze is too much to the already sweet cake...a butter cream or cream cheese frosting would go better.  USE GOOD COFFEE INSTEAD OF WARM WATER!  It adds really good flavor...I also put a dash of vanilla in for depth.  Overall, what I had been searching for!

Ultimately, this still tastes like a cake-mix cake, but still: it's great.  Definitely the best cake we've ever had that started out in a box.

Took out a 1/2c of oil but kept everything else the same, cooked for 40 minutes in my oven. Came out perfectly moist and wonderfully chocolate. Love it!

The name says it all, in a good way.  I love chocolate and this is perfect for a fix.  My boyfriend's parents also enjoyed it.

OMG, can you say YUUMMEEEE! Initially I was scared of all rich ingredients and calories, so what I did just to take the caloric edge off was substitute apple sauce instead of oil, sugar free pudding used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites. absolutely the best chocolate cake I have ever had. I had to put a piece aside for my husband it went so quick!

Oh yeah!!! This is the BEST chocolate cake I've ever made. I am very selective about the chocolate cakes I eat...I figure the cake has to be worth the extra calories. This one is fabulous. Since it was the first time I tried the recipe, I followed it exactly and it came out perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing. I frosted it with the Rich Chocolate frosting recipe from this site and it was sooooo good. I don't usually write reviews, but I had to rave about this cake!

I sent this cake to work with my wife for a halloween pot luck they were having . There were many other desserts there and she told me that everybody liked mine the best. A small portion came home and I tried a piece....yummy!!  But be warned, I went for seconds and before I got 3 bites into that second piece, I developed a belly ache. This cake is very rich!!! One delicious piece per person is all that is nessecary unless you are a dessert eating champion!! This cake is very chocolaty!!! I did top it with chocolate ganache so maybe that put it over the top..but that got raves as well and very easy to make, just 10 ounces bittersweet choclate and a cup of boiling cream whisked together. Seriously folks, this cake should come with a warning label on it!!

This cake was awesome!!! So chocolatey and so good. I topped mine with a homemade milk chocolate topping. Very easy to make:3/4 cup evaporated milk, 1 cup semisweet milk chocolate chips,3/4 cup sugar or to taste and half tsp of vanilla extract. Everyone loved it! It was so moist and rich. Will definately make again.

Cake mixes are limited where I live so I didn't have access to devil's food. I used Duncan Hines Triple Chocolate cake. I also didn't have sour cream so I used homemade plain caspian yogurt. I made these into cupcakes for a pull apart pumpkin cake for a Halloween party. I had to frost them with vanilla frosting. They are absolutely delicious. I don't normally like anything with cake mix, but these are sooooo yummy!!

Absolutely divine! Not too much of a chocolate cake lover, but  couldn't get enough after trying it. Used sugar-free pudding mix, unsweetened apple sauce as veggie oil substitute,  fat free sour cream, topped with "Satin Chocolate Glaze" and toffee bits. Taste so moist and delicious. Thanks for the great recipe! A definite keeper!

To die for! Don't bother telling anyone it starts with a cake mix. Its extremely moist! I didn't care too much for the chocolate chips inside, so think maybe next time I will look for 'mini' chocolate chips to use instead.

This was a delicious and simple recipe.  I used regular chocolate cake mix instead of devil's food.  I also used a sugar-free pudding mix and light sour cream (because it's what I had on hand).  Otherwise, I prepared it exactly as written.  Wonderful recipe!

I always use ways to reduce calorie content without sacrificing taste! I used 1/2c applesauce and 1/3c milk instead of sauce, egg whites, light sour cream, and sugar-free jello pudding, half a bag of mini chocolate chips and this came out moist, rich, and delicious!! If I was taking this to a potluck or event, I'd probably make it by the recipe, but this lower-calorie version is perfect for my family.

Wow, I thought the title was a bit much but this was incredibly chocolate. The way I made it (with chocolate butter cream frosting & raspberry preserves in between the sliced layers) made it TOO MUCH chocolate (I couldn't finish my piece entirely) -- however, I went ahead & gave it 5 stars becuase I got awesome reviews from the co-workers. Next time I make it, I'll just be putting a glaze on it instead of the buttercream frosting -- it will still be very chocolatey!!!

This cake was just "ok" in my opinion. It wasn't as moist as I thought it was going to be. I think it is similar to the mini chocolate cakes at KFC, although I think those are better.

I made this for a friend's birthday and it was a HUGE hit! It is easy to make and easy to dress up with a bit of powdered sugar.  I actually put some chocolate covered strawberries around it and dusted the whole thing with powdered sugar...looked and tasted great!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out amazing!!  Everyone loved it!  I topped the cake with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.  A great combination!!  If you use the glaze, follow other's recommendations and melt the ingredients in the microwave rather than over the oven.

I started using this recipe in May, and I have made it probably 10 times since then. It is my "go to" recipe for cakes and cupcakes. We like to try different flavors, and my boyfriend's favorite is Mint Chocolate Chip. You can use Mint Pudding instead if you'd like, or just add Andes Mints instead of chocolate chips. I've also used white chocolate pudding and chips, and I'm looking forward to making lemon. This is the best recipe I have ever tasted...the sour cream was a bit scary at first, but now I add it to almost everything I bake...it truly makes the difference. Thank you SO much Denise!

This is AWESOME!!! I made it as is the first time. It was yummy but I liked it better the second time I made it with a couple of changes. I used mini choc chips and replaced 1/2 of the oil with applesauce.

Delicious chocolate cake.  I think as is it would make a wonderful loaf cake or layer cake.  I made it as cupcakes and it was a little too soft to hold them together.  I might reduce the oil a bit if I made this recipe as cupcakes again.

DELICIOUS!!!! This cake was loved by everyone! I made a quick glaze by mixing powdered sugar with a bit of milk and drizzled it over the top. When my brother-in-law first saw the cake he said "where is the chocolate frosting?!"...he later admitted to me that it was so rich and chocolaty that he didn't even miss the frosting :)

My husband and I really liked this cake. I used what I had on hand; yellow cake mix, SF cheesecake pudding and I used 2 cups of SS chocolate chips. Based on other reviews I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/3 cup milk instead of 1 cup oil; also used egg whites instead of eggs. I made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website for the topping. I will definitely make this cake again and use different cake mixes/puddings for other great tastes. I LOVE this recipe site! Thanks for a great cake!

Unbelievable!! I made this as a birthday cake for a girl at work and got rave reviews! I cooked this in two 9" pans for about 30-35 minutes. I used fat free sour cream, dark chocolate fudge cake mix, chocolate fudge instant pudding and milk chcolate chips. So yummy! Next time I'm going to use peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips and try peanut butter filling.

This cake is so moist and delicious.  I have made it many times for work and at home for parties and holiday gatherings and it gets devoured every time.  People shamelessly ask for pieces of the cake "to take home to their spouse, kids, whoever..."  Yeah, right, I know they are gobbling it as they are stopped on the side of the dark road!  It's like culinary crack!

I made some "lower cal" modifications: 1 cup Egg Beaters, Sugar Free pudding mix, Light Sour Cream and then I lowered the oil to 3/4 then used 1/4 cup skim milk and reduced the chips to 1 cup. It wasn't the best cake that I have ever had but it satisfied everyone. No one could tell it was a "healthier" version

I have now used this recipe three times, twice in a bundt pan and once as a layer cake. The sour cream and pudding really gives it the made-from-scratch texture without the hassle.  I like it best as a bundt cake decorated simply with just a little powdered sugar and berries.  This cake does not need frosting to make it a complete dessert!  Even with a light whipped cream frosting I found the cake too rich for anything but a tiny slice.

Wonderful cake.  We've got some wheat allergies in our family, so I substituted Pamela's chocolate cake mix for devil's food and it worked perfectly. I also tried it with peanut butter chips, yum!

This is the BEST chocolate cake ever. So rich and delicious. I made round layers with whipped chocolate ganache filling (Pro Ganache recipe), and a ganache glaze on top. It was seriously the best chocolate cake I've ever had.

Wasn't as moist and dense as I would have liked.  I used 2/3 c oil instead of the full amount because of the reviews I read, so if I tried it again I would DEFINITELY use the full cup.  Overall, this cake the way I made it, was OKAY.

My best friend and I made this over the weekend for our new cooking club.  It was so delicious! We followed the recipe exactly. It was VERY easy to do.  The inside was gooey.  The best part was the chocolate chip treasures tucked in all over the place.  YUM!

Very easy, and very good!  It actually made much more than my bundt cake pan could hold.  I kept it in the fridge, and it got even better with time.  I topped it with "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze"....it was wonderful.

I made this cake without the chocolate chips and it was so tender and moist and melt in your mouth. I could not stop eating this cake. I can not wait to try it with the chocolate chips and will make a chocolate ganach to drizzle over the top.

The best chocolate cake recipe I've found so far.  I've given up trying to make chocolate cakes from scratch as they tend to be too dry.  I made this for a rehearsal dinner - skipped the chocolate chips in the batter, and baked in a large 12 inch round pan.  I brushed it with a simple syrup w/vanilla and frosted with chocolate ganache, decoratiing with mini chips on the side.  I thought it would be too soggy with the syrup, but folks raved about how moist it was.  I made a similar one for my husbands finicky firefighters and they loved it too.  A great cake base for all your chocolate cake recipes.  I will be keeping this one for sure!

First time baking this cake...and it was a huge hit at the in-laws for those who enjoy chocolate. I used a silicon bundt pan to bake it in and i needed to leave it in the oven for 25 minutes longer than asked, and with my oven being at 360 as well the cake still was very moist. So glad someone came up with a cake recipe that doesent call for many ingredients and complication.

Delicious, moist, yummy!!! The only change I made to the recipe was to substitute the oil with 1cup of apple sauce. I also preferred to use low-fat sour cream. This was my one and only attempt at this cake, and it turned out exquisite. After all the rave reviews it got, I had no doubts. Everyone in my family rated it 5/5! AAAAh! I made another change, due to my fear of it being toooooooo chocolaty :) I used 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1cup of peanut butter chips. I was afraid of it being too sweet, but I was presently surprised of its semi-sweetness:) Looooooove the melted chocolate!!!

Made this cake yesterday using the andes chocolates as suggested. It was good, but since I love chocolate, I think it would work better for me with pain chocolate chips. This cake is very moist and delicious, though, especially for those who love chocolate. I used the satiny glaze on top, but I think I'll try the ganache the next time.  Great cake, very easy.

Excellent cake. Loved the moist bites of chocolate from using the mini chips (as the first comment advises). I made this with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe also found on this site.

WONDERFUL! I have made this many times now, and have had many compliments. VEry moist and chocolately i love it.  I cooked it in a cake pan (9 x 13) and that worked just fine. Then i drizzled a chocolate glaze from this site over it. My family asks for it all the time now.

I made this with buttercream icing flavored with a little peppermint extract. Tasted like a peppermint patty!

Death by Chocolate!!!! I made this cake and finished it off with "Chocolate Ganache" by ingridevogel, also on this site. I did cut the oil to 1/2 cup, it seemed like so much! And made up the liquid with the warm water. I also used mini chocolate chips. This was the most chocolate of chocolate that I have ever tasted! A small slice goes a long way!

This lived up to the excellent reviews.  I made mini bundt cakes instead of a large cake (just adjust the baking time) and brought them to a work luncheon-they were a huge hit!

Used Duncan Hines and followed the recipe exactly. I also used mini chips which worked very well. Glazed with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site. Thanks

I made this in a 9X13 cake pan and it came out WONDERFUL!! I followed the recipe exactly. The cake came out so moist and VERY YUMMY!! My husband LOVED it. I even took a few pieces to work to share with the girls in my office and they all asked for the recipe. I will definitely make this one over and over again!

You can never have too much chocolate.  Rich chocolate favor, moist, delicious.  This is a forever keeper. And if you try a piece while its warm, Its hard not to have that second slice.  Thanks for sharing, and congrats.

My kids and I liked it, but way too much chocolate for my husband.  Next time instead of putting instant chocolate pudding, I'll try vanilla so that it would cut down on the chocolate taste some what.  I don't think it would destroy the total cake though.  I'll try doing it that way next time.

So, from all the reviews I was expecting to be completely blown away, and while it was pretty good, it wasn't THAT good. It's really moist, but not that chocolatey to me. It is so amazing with peanut butter frosting though! I'll definitely make it again.

This cake was amazing and so easy to make! My husband is already asking when I'm going to make another...I did make a simple glaze out of powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla to go on top, but it would have been great just plain too!

Pretty good for a box cake recipe.  I prefer the moistness of a homemade variety but this was good and a big time-saver sin c I had two birthday cakes.  I also used the satiny glaze recipe on this bundt cake.

I made mini cupcakes for a baby shower out of this recipe and they were PERFECT! I only put in 3/4 C oil and 1 C chocolate chips since they were such small cupcakes and it was just right.  I baked them at 350 for 15 minuets.  Will me making these again soon!

I made this cake for a baby shower.  I made individual-sized cakes by baking a 9x13 cake and cutting it into 24 pieces, filling them, and frosting them with ganache.  Excellent!  Got rave reviews at the shower and my husband's work (he took the leftovers).  I also made a round 8-inch (2 layer) cake, which turned out excellent as well.

I took this cake to a 4th of July party, and everybody loved it.  The only thing I did different was using coffee instead of water. Gives it a richer favor without the taste of coffee.

Our family loves this cake. It is wonderfully rich and moist, and very, very chocolately. We have made this recipe more times than we can count. Very easy to make, especially since you do not have to ice it! It definitely does not taste like a "doctored up cake mix". If you are looking for an amazing, easy, cake that tastes like you put lots of hard work into it, here is the cake for you! My recommendation is to warm it up in the microwave to make it taste as though it just came out of the oven. One of our favorite recipes that will remain in our family cookbook forever!

OMG!  This is the best chocolate cake i've ever had.  I love cake and chocolate has never been my favorite, until now.  It's so rich!  I made it exactly as the recipe was written and it turned out perfect.  It did take almost an hour to bake before it was done.  I'm making it again this week for a party at work.  (plus i can't wait to eat it again)

Too much chocolate?! I dont think there is ever such a thing! It was very moist & delicious!! I took others advice and went w/ the mini chocolate chips. I used 2 round 8 in. cake pans and made a fathers day cake using chocolate fudge buttercream frosting. I served it w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream & it was soo yummy!! The cake is a dense cake but like I said I loved it!!

Oh man!!!  This was wonderful.  Probably one of the heaviest cakes I have ever made.  The pan I made it in was smaller than it called for so it required a longer baking time.  This cake was by far the most moist I have ever ate.Thanks Denise.

My husband loved this cake on Fathers' day. It was very easy.  I only had one (small) package of pudding though, so I substituted the dream whip that I have been wondering what to do with. The batter was thick enough to hold the normal sized chocolate chips, no need to buy the tinies.  The cake was delicious and moist with chocolate chips in every bite, everyone loved it.

Chocoholic rated this cake a five-star.  It was as pretty as it was moist and delicious.  I used two boxes of 3.4 oz Instant Choc Pudding mixes as I did not have the size called for. Powdered sugar lightly dusted over top was all it needed to complete.

Delicious and moist - made it as the directions said.  I will try it with 1/2 the oil replaced with applesauce next time to save calories.

A friend put a link to this cake on facebook and I just had to try it.  I am glad I did.  I went ahead and made a chocolate ganache to drizzle on the top.  I ended up using two 9 in round pans.  Sent the rest to work with my husband and it was all gone before 8AM!!  You really have tp try this cake.  If you LOVE CHOCOLATE you will love this.

OMG! I have made this cake about 5 times now and every time I do, there is never any left overs. I taught my neices how to make it and there are driving my sister crazy with making it everyday. Easy, moist and so good. The best cake I have ever come across. Thank you to whom ever created this cake.

Very good.  Very moist and came out of the pan with no problem--I sometimes have problems with cakes coming out of bundt pans.  I couldn't find chocolate pudding at my local grocery store, so I used devil's food pudding instead.  I think it came out a bit more rich.  Everyone at work raved about it at work and it was gone before the end of the day.

Best "plain" chocolate cake I have ever had!  Wife made it for me for Father's Day and I couldn't have asked for a better cake!  Very moist, incredile chocolate taste, and the melted mini-chocolate chips were amazing!!!!  We didn't have a bundt so we used 2 bread pans and cooked exactly as written.  This one I printed for the recipe book!  A true keeper considering how easy this is to make!!!!!

Absolutely delicious and held together wonderfully even though it was very moist. Wonderful warm ala mode. The mini chocolate chips melted and made it even more fabulous. I didn't have chocolate pudding so I used a cheesecake pudding - I'm sure anything would work. Used sugar free pudding and lite sour cream.

AWESOME! I've made this several times, and it's always turned out well. Super easy, and everyone thinks it's fantastic. Only suggestion I have is to use mini chocolate chips, as others said...you get lots of chocolate bits throughout, instead of just at the bottom!

OMG!!!!   My husband said "this is dangerous" when he first took a bite.  He was right. The cake is addictively delicious.  So much chocolate but not disgustingly sweet as many chocoate desserts can be.  It is so moist and just absolutely delicious.  The best part about this recipe was that all the ingredients were already on my pantry shelf.  Well worth it and a new family favorite.  I put a glaze on it and WOW was it yummy.

I made this for all the chocolate lovers at a family gathering, but we had a lot left (to be fair there were several deserts, that's why I still give it 4 stars).  It is very chocolaty-way too much for me, but I don't care for chocolate-the true chocolate lovers loved it.

I made this for my cousin's graduation party and everyone loved it!  Couldn't get enough. I followed the recipe but frosted with chocolate frosting.  Next time I will dust with powdered sugar..add raspberries and substitute water for strong coffee.

Topped with a whole lot of chocolate glaze and made for my husband and father's birthdays. For those guys, there is no such thing as too much chocolate! And I have to agree, it was delicious!

AWESOME!!!  Everyone loved this cake!  The only change I made was taking the suggestion to use mini chocolate chips and then I added the Satiny Chocolate Glaze as well as mini chips and chocolate sprinkles on top.  Looked fabulous and tasted even better.  I had several requests for the recipe.  You can't go wrong for chocolate lovers! This will be made many, many times!

I made some changes I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of milk and also I used 3/4 cup of  mini chocolate chips semi sweet because I don't like too much chocolate. The taste is very good and moist. Thanks for the recipe.

This was phenomenal. I made it for my Dad's outdoor birthday party because I needed a cake without frosting that wouldn't melt in the heat.  I used mini-chocolate chips as someone else suggested, and everyone raved about it.  People who at first declined a piece changed their minds based on what other guests were saying about it.  So moist and delicious, and SUPER easy!  I will make it again and again.  Also, I topped with powdered sugar for visual appeal.

Great taste for such an easy recipe. Will make this again without a doubt. Anone who rated it below a 5 either screwed it up or didn't bake it long enough. I baked at 350 degrees for 65 minutes, checking it at 50 minutes with a toothpick every 5 minutes til done(:

Very very good, especially for a doctored cake mix. Got rave reviews. Very moist. I was not expecting such good results even though there is a 5 star rating. I was pleasantly surprised!!   (Used Satiny Chocolate glaze to top, doubled that recipe)

I took this to work for a friends birthday and everyone loved it! I decorated the top of the cake with coconut rum balls and drizzled melted chocolate. Overall it ended up looking like an expensive store-bought cake, not something that I had whipped up the night before!

YUMMMM!!!  I was a bit hesitant because of the thick consistency of the batter.  I used a small pkg of coconut instant pudding (it was all I had) and a pkg of single serve jello chocolate instant pudding.  The cake was still slightly warm when I ate...I mean devoured a piece, so the chips were melted and gooey.

Very yummy! Did have to use white chocolate swirled chips instead of just chocolate (couldn't find regular semi choco chips)... but the cake still came out extremely tastey. Will have to try it w/ other cake mix/pudding combos :D Baking time for me was about 65 mins in a bundt pan.

OMGosh!  What a SINFUL cake!!  I did not use a devil's food mix (could not remember when I was at the grocery store), I used a regular chocolate mix.   The cake was a HUGE hit!  Once you have one taste, you will not be able to stop yourself!   And very easy to make!  Great potluck cake!  And would probably do well at a bake sale too!

I made the recipe as is, and I thought the instant pudding texture was a little weird. My family, however, thought it was delicious.  I frosted it with the "Special Buttercream Frosting" found here.

Okay, so it's NEVER my habit to review something I haven't finished making yet, but I just (forgive the child in me) put the cake in the oven and I took a sample of the batter from the spatula and I almost passed out!  The taste of pure chocolate overcame me!  I can't wait for this to come out the oven!  If you're looking for a quick cake and you want people to think you spent all week on it, look no further. Gonna try something and if it comes out well, I'll let everyone know. Thanks for this "Blue Ribbon" cake! If I ever open a restaurant, this cake will be on the dessert menu!

Oh my goodness. The only thing I dislike about the recipe is the name. There is not such thing as "too much chocolate". I followed the recipe exactly and was regarded with a rich chocolate cake that didn't need any frosting. Wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing it!

Subbed in sugar-free pudding mix and used 2/3 cup applesauce and only 1/3 cup oil.   The big winner was adding one of those VIA packets from Starbucks in with the hot water.   This cake was really moist and amazing - will be trying it soon with different flavors of cake, pudding, etc.  Looked beautiful with Satiny Chocolate icing and chocolate shavings on top!

I made this cake exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out wonderful! I baked mine in a glass 9 x 13 pan instead of a bundt pan and did not have any problems. It still needed to cook the 55 minutes. I did frost mine with chocolate frosting. I tried a piece when it was a little warm with cool whip and a small piece with frosting and felt it needed the frosting. This cake does taste much better once it is cooled completely. Great recipe! I will make this again!

OMG!  This was insanely good.  I used mini chocolate chips and it really worked out great.  A scrumptious, chocolately, rich dessert, a real chocoholics delight!  And..fancy looking coming out of the bundt pan!  I used "Satiny chocolate glaze"..I doubled that recipe, just because! I can't rave enough about this recipe! :)

The Ultimate Chocolate Cake--I don't think I've ever had one this moist, rich & simple!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to trim calories (sugar-free pudding, fat-free sour cream, 2/3 cup applesauce-1/3 cup oil) and it was still incredible. Ten people (many watching their waist lines) at a birthday get-together devoured it & my sister-in-law declared I should have baked cakes for a living. (I'll never admit it starts with a cake mix!) Can't wait to try other variations. Thanks for an awesome recipe & the helpful suggestions!

This was great! I made this for a coworker's birthday and everyone enjoyed it. It was very rich though, I think next time I would omit the chocolate chips.

WOW - this was the best chocolate cake I have ever had! I got recuited to make my boss a birthday cake and he is a huge chocolate lover so this sounded perfect.  I baked this in 2-9" round pans for 45 minutes and they came out perfectly.  I frosted them with a store bought milk chocolate icing because I dind't have time to make my own chocolate buttercream.  After I frosted the cake I did some piping around the edges and then topped the cake with chocolate sprinkles.  Everyone loved it!

Mmmmm... Husband thought it was made from scratch! Used Pillsbury reduced sugar chocolate cake mix, large box of sugar free chocolate fudge pudding mix and 1/2 bag dark chocolate chips. Also used reduced fat sour cream. Baked in a 9x13 for about 35 mintues. So moist and super yummy! Easy and quick to make too!

Made this in a 12x "bundt" cake pan. I ended up with 2+ pans of something far better than brownies or muffins.

Followed the recipe exactly, except that I tossed the chocolate chips in a bit of flour to make sure they did not sink.  It was easy to make and my guests enjoyed it very much.

I made this for a Valentine's Day dinner & movie date with my girl friends and everyone raved about it! I added sliced strawberries on top in addition to a drizzle of white and dark chocolate! This was also not "too bad" for us as I used a low-fat cake mix, fat free sour cream and so on: even so, this was so moist and decadent we couldn't stop eating it!

This recipe did not impress me all that much.  Maybe I need to make it again.  The batter was so thick and it still tasted like a box cake.  It was ok, as far as a cake goes, dark chocolate color, but lacked something for me.

It's not that this cake was bad - by no means was it bad. It just didn't blow me away like I was expecting, with the decadent ingredient list. It just tasted like a plain old chocolate cake to me.

Very moist and chocolaty; enjoyed it very much.  It does have a slight "artificial" flavor, but if you regularly eat cakes from a boxed mix you won't notice it.  As suggested by other reviewers, I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/3 cup milk.  I also used miniature chocolate chips instead of regular.  Finally, I drizzled it with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this web site.

I make this quite often, always a hit! I do cut back the oil to about 1/2 of what the recipe calls for. I usually don't add chocolate chips instead I put the satiny glaze recipe on top.

This was delicious - the densest, richest chocolate cake I've ever made! You definitely don't need large slices. I served with vanilla bean ice cream and it was great.

This was the best cake I have ever had. Period. We used milk chocolate chips instead. And we smothered the whole thing in chocolate ganache (half a bag of chips, 3/4 c heavy cream, bit of butter). So. Incredibly. Delicious.

Not impressed. It tasted like a chocolate muffin you'd buy in the bakery of the grocery store! It was moist and looked beautiful, but with this many 5 stars I guess I was expecting a whole lot more. I will not make this again.

This cake was a hit at my family Easter get-together. There was another basic chocolate cake with store bought icing and nobody touched it after one person had a taste of mine! I used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe to ice the cake. I also used mini chocolate chips, but left them out of the batter and instead sprinkled them on top of the iced cake. Very rich and very delicious! My family is already begging me to make it again and to give them the recipe!

I too, like the others reviewing, thought this was a good cake but prefer the Hersheys Chocolate Cake. I put the satiny glaze on it. I doubled that recipe. Thought it needed more icing. Im sure I'll make this cake again since its so easy. Had too many pieces of this on Easter Sunday. :-/

Divine. Try this with cinnamon chips for the perfect ending to a Spanish/Mexican meal. Whenever you see "Mexican chocolate" mentioned, it has cinnamon in it. Nuke a tub of dark chocolate frosting with a little cinnamon added & drizzle over the cake. Garnish with fresh rasberries.

5 star plus another 5 star!!! this cake is amazing. Easy, quick and so tastey. We served it with ice cream or whipping cream and both made it even more perfect. Not too sweet, just right for a chocoholic like me.

This was great.  I do think mini chocolate chips would be even better (as a previous reviewer mentioned).  I put this in 2 9" round pans and cooked it for 45 minutes it worked perfectly.  After the cakes had cooled, they settled, so they were not raised in the middle, like my cakes always do.  I loved this because I didn't need to shave off the top to set them on top of each other, making a cleaner, easier assembly process.  Would make again!

I'm not sure whether to give this recipe 4 or 5 stars.  I'm giving it 5 stars because for a cake, it's absolutely amazing and much better than all standard cakes I've had.   I don't think I would ever choose this over a delicious brownie recipe or chocolate mousse though.  However, it will definitely be my standard recipe for birthday cakes.  I made it in a 9 inch spring form pan, covered it with satiny glaze, decorated it for my husband's birthday, and it came out great.

It was a really great moist cake.  I made it for a staff birthday and dusted it with powdered sugar before serving.  I think next time I will drizzle with something more, I am not sure what....caramel or just a simple sugar glaze for it to be perfect for us.  I mean if you are going to blow the calories may as well go all out.

I made this last night, and people kept raving about how moist the cake was. This makes a beautiful cake, and best of all, it's easy! I'm planning to use a lemon cake mix, lemon pudding, and lemon juice (in place of the water) to make another cake this Friday. Thanks so much for sharing such a delicious recipe!

I've made this chocolate cake twice with the satiny glaze and it was incredible.  I tried it with variation of a lemon cake, lemon pudding and white chocolate chips.  It did not come out the same at all.  The white chocolate chips settled to the bottom of the cake and the bottom 1/2" of the cake was very sticky and actually stuck to the pan.  When I did get it out, that sticky part was now the top of the cake and just crumbled off, while the rest of the cake was perfect.  Also making the satiny glaze with white chocolate chips did not work either. Next time I will have to leave the chips out of the cake and find another white chocolate glaze for the top.

I have made this cake 3 times now.  And each time, it gets rave reviews and each time with the Satiny Choc. Glaze.  I made it for a 4th time last night, and instead of using chocolate chips, I used peanut butter chips.  And I made a peanut butter glaze to go over it.   Peanut butter and chocolate is my husbands favorite combo!  I am sure that it will be just as good.  My next plan is to use this recipe as a base for a lemony cake.

This was fantastic. I baked it exactly as the recipe called for, except for using a 12 oz bag of mini chocolate chips instead of regular sized chips based on numerous reviewers recommendations. It was perfect. I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website, which made it that much better! The submitter suggests allowing cake to cool for at least an hour and a half, doing so allows the chips to solidify again. But, this cake is really good warm too if you can't wait. You can alway taste it when it's cool the next day...if there are any leftovers!

I just returned from our Easter chuch picnic.  One of our members stated that this was "the best cake I have ever tasted, this is my 3rd piece"! I did use the mini chips this time and that worked very well.

My baking never turns out, this was so easy and came out of the bundt perfect, was also very flavorful. I followed some reviews and added mini chips, I think I would prefer to use bigger ones so you get that little chocolate crunch in the middle.

I have made this cake several times as round cake and cupcake. I used cream cheese frosting with chopped strawberries for filling and iced the top with cream cheese frosting decorated with whole strawberries then drizzle the chocolate on top. It came out nice and my kids loved it! I am going to use this recipe as a sheet cake and make an Indiana Jones cake for my son's 9th birthday party next week. --Update-- My sons liked the cake and couldn't get enough of it~!  It might be a little different than I imagined, but I had fun making it and the birthday boy was happy, so everything worked out:)

This Chocolate cake is amazing!!! if you like chocolate you will love this one. I prefer the regular size chips even if they do sink to the bottom because you can actually feel and taste the chocolate chunks in your mouth. I served it strawberries.Yum!!

Excellent cake.  I didn't have enough sour cream so I added some yogurt as suggested by another reviewer, and it still turned out great.  I think next time I will try the satiny chocolate glaze.

I really like this recipe, it does not taste like a doctored mix – it is extremely chocolaty. I have followed the recipe to a “t” and it has turned out perfectly each time, rave reviews and requests from everyone. The one tiny thing I alter is I take the 2 cups of chocolate chips (I like the taste of 1 cup semi and 1 cup milk) and pulse them in the food processor until they are in smaller pieces. This ensures several tiny delectable morsels of chocolate in each bite without the chips dropping to the bottom or being obvious that I threw chocolate chips in the batter. Great recipe!

The flavor is decent, but the pudding mix gave it a processed aftertaste.  Also, it is a very dense, moist cake - almost like a brownie.  I used egg whites & applesauce to cut back on calories/fat & baked at 325 as suggested by other reviewers.  It's good, but it left something to be desired.  I'll try adding some vanilla and/or butter next time and whipping the egg whites some.

Wow, what a chocolate extravaganza!  I made the recipe exactly as directed and added a chocolate buttercream frosting on top and it was the extreme chocolate experience I was hoping for.  It tasted a lot like packaged chocolate brownies with chocolate chips and chocolate frosting, but I thought that was delicious!  I did coat my choc chips with flour which helped suspend them throughout the batter, rather than sinking to the bottom, as one reviewer had suggested.  Definitely I think using mini-chips would be good for the next time I make this so the chips are smaller amounts throughout the whole cake.  I felt like the large chips were just a little too much when you'd bite into them, though they were good.  I baked it for 45 minutes and it was obviously not cooked enough yet, so I put it in for another ten minutes and could smell it starting to burn 8 minutes into it (ie. at total of 53 minutes).  I mention this so everyone knows to be sure to watch it closely - it goes from undercooked to overcooked very quickly.  Luckily, I caught it before it burned and it was still extremely moist and tasy.  Good recipe for chocoholics!

I made this cake yesterday for my family and a few guests, and we all agreed that is it the best cake we have ever had! I served it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze and it was absolutely perfect. Everyone wanted the recipe - thank you for sharing!!

True to its words, this is a very chocolatey cake.  Made the cake in two 9 inch pans and baked it for ~40 minutes.  Turned out beautifully and was very easy to decorate.  Baked it for my husband's birthday and the family loved it.

OMG, soooo good!!!  This cake turned out heavenly & cured the chocolate craving I had been dealing with all week.  For the chocolate chips I used 1 cup of regular milk chocolate chips and 1 cup mini semi sweet chips; loved the variation. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly as written. Just dusted powdered sugar over it and was pleased to find that it was a great cake without having to add frosting.  I was so pleased with how super simple this recipe was & will for sure make again!

I made this cake yesterday for a meeting. It was really good, a few of the guest commented on how good it was and asked me if I made it. I only used 3/4 cup of oil and I added 3/4 cup of walnuts in the batter. I topped it off with the icing that another member put in her reveiw and served it with vanilla ice cream.

I used 1/2 cup oil, 1/3 cup skim milk, and 2 cups mini chocolate chips, as others had suggested.  I spread raspberry jam inbetween the cake layers.  It was delicious!

I love this recipe, it's so simple!! I made this as cupcakes, for my fiances birthday and then again this weekend and they were an absolute hit! -Followed the hints about using only 3/4 c oil and MINI chocolate chips and that makes it perfect.  -When making cupcakes, I did a dozen at a time and it generally took 25-30 minutes to cook at the temp listed. -Pairs really well with a whipped cream cheese frosting! -As long as you store them properly, they stay nice and moist for days.

I've never tried making a box cake with added ingredients-- I thought it would make the cake taste better. But it didn't. A box cake is a box cake. Not terrible-- just a box cake.

Well this was certainly interesting. A great cake, very moist. Very very chocolately. I usually like cakes that are a bit more dense and heavy, but I enjoyed this one nonetheless.

This is probably one of my favorite cake recipes.  I've made it twice and it's turned out wonderful.  I made it with the milk chocolate chips the last time and it's even more chocolatey.  Everyone has raved over this, make sure you love chocolate, this is for the true chocolate lover!!  It's very moist and the melted chocolate chips makes the cake very creamy and yummy!!!

Made this for my best friend's birthday, and she loved it! Topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze. It definitely tasted best when warm, so we put a couple slices in the microwave after it had been sitting out awhile. Will make again and try different toppings on it.

I make these as cup cakes (makes about 16), using applesauce instead of oil, low fat sour cream, fat free pudding mix, 2 eggs and 2 egg whites.  Cooks in about 20 minutes and you've got instant portion control...if you can stop at just one.

Hope you like chocolate if you are making this recipe!  One of the best chocolate cakes ever! Made it for the office staff at my school and they LOVED it!  Followed directions exactly, needed a few more mins. in the oven, just turned down the heat to 330 and let bake for a few more mins.!

I'm changing my original posting of 2* to 4****. I made this 2 days ago, and I think it has improved. Also, heating in the microwave for about 30 seconds makes it even better. I followed the recipe exactly, and used the Satin glaze posted here. It is very decadent, and very chocolatey.

This is a keeper.  I've been looking for a really good chocolate cake, one that is not too light and fluffy and has the right amount of moisture and density.  This is it.  I used mini chocolate chips, as some one recommended, and also fat free Sour Cream (sorry, it's all I had, tho I know it's ridiculous to use it on a lusheous cake) and it still turned out wonderful.  Didn't frost, didn't need it.  Goes great with a glass of milk.  The cake mix and pudding mix make this easy as well.

OMG!  This is a chocolate lovers dream!! I LOVE this cake!  The only change I made was used the mini chocolate chips, and used the recipe satiny chocolate glaze instead of the powdered sugar.  This will most definitely be a "monthly" staple in my house!!!!!!

This cake was awesome!  I made it just as the recipe said and I also made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze to go on top (using dark chocolate chips). This cake is really rich and goes nicely with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.

Made this exactly as recipe stated & it was absolutely amazing! I did make the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" in the microwave to save time & I don't have a double boiler. I microwaved all the icing ingredients (except vanilla) for 30 seconds, stirred well and did an addl. 30 seconds. PERFECT & it makes a sinful amount. These two recipes were meant for each other. I had many takers to lick the bowl & spoon. We had late night guests over after a concert and we devoured this cake & (decaf) coffee. Moist, rich, smooth...chocolate lovers have found their soul mate with this recipe. Imagine all the flavor possibilities you could have just by changing the "chips"......butterscotch, mint, white chocolate.......no doubt in my mind, this will be made many times to come.

this cake didn't last long at my house.  i followed the recipe exactly but forgot to put in the pudding--and it was still great!  i made in into a heart shape like another reviewer and drizzled it with the chocolate from the choc covered strawberries (from allrecipes) and garnished with the choc covered strawberries.  mmmm!

This was the best cake I've ever made. The only thing I changed was using less oil, about 2/3 cup. It turned out great! Everyone in my family wanted the recipe. After I tried this chocolate version I made a yellow cake version for my hubby's b-day. I just used yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding! I can't wait to try other flavor combinations. From now on when I make a box cake I will use this recipe!!!

This cake really is good, and its perfect for people who like darker chocolate because of all of the semi-sweet chips!  I made the recipe exactly as shown, except I used 12 oz of the mini chips because I didn't want them to sink.  The batter it makes really is so thick that I'm not sure its necessary, so I think next time I'll try with the regular chips!  A lot of people said that after 50 minutes, the toothpick wasn't coming out clean.  I had the same thing happen, but its hard to tell if its the batter that isn't done, or if there are just SO many chocolate chips that you happened to poke a melted chip instead!  :)    I left it for 60 minutes and it was perfect, and I'd definitely make it again!

This recipe is great.  I've been using the same recipe for years.  I got it from Dom DeLuise's cookbook.  The only thing I do different is I add the chocolate chips to the batter, bake it for an hour.  Then I melt a can of chocolate frosting in the microwave and pour over the cake.  My family loves it and it's always a hit at family get togethers with a big glass of cold milk!

Defiantly use the small Chocolate Chips, they don't get in the way of the smooth consistence of the cake, I think it would be fine without them though. I did 1/2 Cup Oil 1/2 cup apple sauce. Then did 1/4 milk and 1/4 water. It was great. The office really liked it in cupcake form.

There's a lot of different variations of box+pudding cakes floating around.  This is one of the good ones!  I used vanilla pudding (all I had) and also added 1/2 cup Kahlua.  Used only 1/2 cup oil like other recipes of this type.  Next time I'll use the chocolate pudding as suggested, but I'll keep the Kahlua.  Thought of using a glaze, but was happy with the powdered sugar.

I made this recipe, and followed some of the suggestions - I used 3/4 cup oil, and 1/2 cup STRONG coffee instead of H2O.  Also used mini dark chocolate chips.  I made three 8" layers, and filled them with a mixture of chocolate fudge pudding, cool whip, cream cheese and 1/2 cup of the same coffee.  It was light and "mocha" flavored and delish!  For icing I used chocolate fudge frosting mixed with 2 tbls. coffee liquor, amd topped it with some pretty designs with white frosting and dark chocolate espresso beans!  AMAZING!!

Fabulous recipe as is! A true winner for any party or special occasion.  I made it for Valentines day and used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze to top it (also from AR) and it was to die for!  One of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had!  You will love it!  :)

I used this recipe for my annual Valentine's Day cupcakes.  Delicious!  The recipe made 12 jumbo cupcakes and 16 smaller (think regular muffin liners).  Baked to perfection at 20-22 minutes.  Iced them with "Chocolate Frosting I."  I used a pastry bag to pipe on the icing...a nice, elegant touch.  Received rave reviews; will make again and again.  Oh, and I used the mini chocolate chips - great suggestion.

Awesome - Valentine's day hit.  I also slightly cut calories using Pillsbury's reduced sugar Devil's Food Cake mix with Splenda and light sour cream (by friendship).  I flanked with fresh raspberries and whipped cream.  Cake=very happy boyfriend!  Thanks!  I think next I will try with the mini chocolate chips.

This recipe is outstanding! I made it for my husband's 40th Bday and he loved it. And he is a huge chocoholic. I felt better knowing this was at least somewhat lower in calories. It was very moist. I used fat-free sour cream, applesauce instead of oil, but had to add some skim milk (about 1/2 c) because of the consistency. I didn't tell my husband it was lower-cal and he had no reason to suspect it. 5 stars!

When they say "Too much chocolate cake" that could be right.  It's very chocolaty!  So I tried a few other cake/pudding/chip combinations and they all came out great.  I did a yellow cake/white chocolate pudding/chocolate chip combo and a cherry chip cake /vanilla pudding/cherry chips combo, as well as a german chocolate, chocolate pudding, choc. chip combo reducing the amount of chips needed in each.  There were a few too many for us.  It's fun to try new combinations and change out the frostings on top.  This website has taught me you don't have to stick exactly to the recipe if you don't want to.  And reviews give great advice.

I made this cake two times, but it would not cook properly in the center without overcooking/burning the sides. However in those parts where it did cook correctly, it tasted amazing!  So next time I will try less oil, as it has been suggested in other reviews.

FABULOUS!   I follow the suggestion of cutting the oil back by a 1/4 and using coffee instead.  I used a caramel glaze that was just 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c butter and 2 ts milk.  It was like a caramel mocha chocolate heaven.  I think I will try adding 2 Ts of instant coffee to give it a little extra kick.    But this one is for sure going into the recipe book for me!  And the valentine loved it too!

Excellent cake.  I added peanut butter chips and mini chocolate chips to the batter.  I then frosted the cake with chocolate frosting and sprinkled more mini chips on the cake.  I made this for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best cake!

Combine how easy this is to make with how good it tastes & it easily gets 5 stars! To make it a tad bit healthier I substituted the oil for applesauce. I also set the oven to 335 & put it in for 60min. It came out perfect.  The cake is so moist & deliciously chocolately, love it! I make this all the time now. And it keeps for a while, I had it for a week & it never went dry! This recipe is a keeper for sure. Thank you!

To quote my husband, this cake was "phenomenal".  I'm not a huge cake fan, but this recipe is amazing.  I followed it exactly (I did use mini chips), and it required about an extra 10 minutes in the oven.  I will definitely be making this again!  Soon!

I made this cake last night and it turned out pretty well.  I was unsure about part of the directions and hope someone can help me.  In step 2, it says to mix together.  Should I beat the batter for 2 minutes like you normally do with box cake mixes, or do you just stir until everything is mixed.  Thanks!!

You can also do this with lemon cake mix and lemon pudding.  (of course eliminate the chips) and drizzle a mixture of orange juice and powdered sugar over the top...MMMmmmm!  Thanks for the recipe!

Especially for the ease, this is a very good cake! The consistency is perfect. I have had trouble in the past with cakes w/ pudding in the recipe in that the outside is a little crunchy by the time the middle is done. so i baked this cake for longer at 300 instead of 350. it was perfect! I did cut the oil to 1/2 cup and used a food processor to chop the choc chips b/c I didn't have mini ones. I cut down to 1 cup of choc chips as others recommend, but will try 1 and 1/2 next time. I also substituted coffee for water and added a little cocoa powder to make it darker in flavor. I can't wait to make this again...it was so delicious!

Very quick and easy to make.  I followed the instructions listed, but probably should have cut the amount of oil that I added as other users had recommended because it took at least 10 minutes longer for the cake to bake all the way through and I ended up covering it with tin foil to ensure that the exposed part didn't burn.  I will definitely make this cake again though, especially if I am short on time.

I made this recipe for my family and it was the best. My daughter gave her piece a heat up in the microwave and said it was delicious. It reminded her of lava cake. Best to serve small pieces and plenty of cold milk.  Definitely a chocolate lovers dessert.  I will make again.

Excellent!  Didn't alter recipe at all and dinner club gals raved about it!  Quick, easy to take to any function.  Moist and rich.  Served with Satiny Chocolate Glaze, stawberries and vanilla ice cream.

My BF had never made a cake before, and I made him make this for my B-day since I hate store bought cakes.  He made it with no problems so you know it's a very simple recipe.  He used mini-choco-chips and poured "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" over it.  Excellent.

My co-workers love when I bring one of these cakes to work. It is even better than a flourless chocolate cake I used to make, and so much easier. I cut back on the oil by 1/4 cup, and like a previous reviewer, I use mini chocolate chips so the cake is just a litle lighter. The Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site is the perfect frosting without being too sweet. I have found chocolate nirvana!

I am not crazy for chocolate cake, I just think is ok, but this one is fantastic!!! It's very moist and melts in your mouth. My neighbor couldn't have enought and was asking for the recipe. I also made a graze called "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this website and it goes very well on it.

This recipe is very similar to the Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake which uses 2 cups of sour cream and uses Kahlua or strong coffee as the liquid.  A very good and moist cake that does not need an icing.

Yummy....My son turned 12 yesterday, even a mid-week birthday deserves celebration. I always make the kids what they want for dinner on their birthdays. I wanted to make a cake, but due to basketball games and a busy day I couldn't make anything too elaborate. I found the recipe here. It was super easy to make and the taste would have been worth more effort. I love to cook and don't usually use a lot of short cuts, but this is a recipe that I can have ingredients on hand and when I need something on short notice or when the family is craving chocolate I can make everyone happy. Even the best of cooks can use recipes that save time but still give us a great result for a fraction of the time.

This was a fantastic recipe.  It was also very easy and my family loved it.  I did use 3/4C of oil and 1/2C milk as suggested and it was perfect.

I made this cake last week, and I can't even begin to say how wonderful it is. It was so good by itself I did not even put icing on the cake. I will use this recipe again and again. next time I will reduce the cho. chips and I might butter and sugar the cake pan.

I went with the 1/2c. oil 1/2 c. milk version using only 1 cup of the mini-chocolate chips and substituting coffee for the water. Also baked it in a 9x13. I frosted it with light cool whip and the remainder of the mini chips. Since I changed the original recipe I went with 5 stars. Good, but not the extreme chocolate flavor I was going for. The cake was moist with a nice crumb. It works really well as an alternative to a plain cake mix cake. If you bring it to a potluck, your cake will be eaten first!

Oh my goodness!  I made this last night for my father's birthday and it was SOOOO good!!!  Seriously, this is the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  Throw away all your other chocolate cake recipes and make this.  I made it with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from allrecipes.com and it was delicious.  We all loved it!  Thanks so much for such a great recipe!!

Exceptional chocolate cake! This recipe bakes up high and perfectly moist and is also good for layer cakes and cupcakes. I freeze the layers after turning out of the pan, then cut and ice for a perfect finish. I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and topped it with light pink icing, chocolate covered strawberrys, pink sugar crystals, left over mini choc. morsels and the candles and it was beautiful! Thanks so much for the perfect chocolate cake!

im not sure what went wrong. i followed the instructions exactly, but it would not bake correctly. at 55 min at 350 it was done on the outside but gooey/raw inside. i baked it for an additional 15 min and it was done on the inside, but now the outside was hard. aside from that issue, this cake was good, but nothing special. if i had tasted this somewhere i wouldnt ask for the recipe. i still need to find THE chocolate cake recipe i will keep coming back to!

Just like the 950+ other reviews before me, I LOVED this! Seriously try this because you'll end up using this as your ONLY cake recipe.  I made it last night for the first time and used only 1 cup of mini morsels because I was worried it would be 'too much'...but after the taste test, I'll definitely use 2 cups next time. I just had another slice of cake this morning and it was BETTER than last night! I made it in a cake pan (I don't have a bundt one) and it turned out great.  I cannot wait to make big muffins or cupcakes with this recipe as it's a very dense cake.  I'll only use this recipe from now on!  THANKS for sharing!!!

This cake was so moist and so thick! It is def a heavy cake! I made it into 2 rounds and put seedless raspberry jam in between them! I used a recipe from here for frosting and placed fresh raspberries on the top.  I made this for my boyfriends birthday and sent it to work with him.  A few weeks later at a work event we went to, I had all his co-workers (men) coming up to me making sure I knew when their birthdays were! haha! I would def. make this again!

I've made this cake several times now, sometimes with yellow cake and lemon pudding! :) It is ALWAYS a huge hit. Everyone raves and asks for the recipe. Thanks! UPDATE its nearly 3 years now since I first found this recipe - and its made its way into the hearts of hundred.  It is so versatile, so amazing, so requested and so easy.  I quite think its the perfect cake :) Heres my latest variation: Red Velvet cake mix wih butterscotch pudding mix..... ymmmmmmmmm UPDATE 9-7-12 This cake is still the best! I've made this cake nearly monthly now for various events and always asked for the recipe. Thank you again Denise!

OMG! This was fantastic.  I followed other suggestions and used mini-chocolate chips vs. regular and it turned out perfect!  I also used the satiny chocolate glaze (from this site) and thought it added the right touch to it (not too sweet).  I brought in half to work so we wouldn't go through the whole thing at home!  Even DH, who hates cake-like things, raved about this one (and snuck up to get a piece for breakfast before I could cart it off to work).  Going to make again this weekend and have already given out 6 copies of the recipe.

Followed recipe as stated, substituted mini chocolate chips as they don't settle on the top of the cake when prepared in a bundt pan.  I make this at least twice a year as it is my man's favorite cake.

Very Good.  I do not own a Bundt pan so I used a 10" Springform pan instead.  It needed to cook a little longer (5-10 minutes).  I just had to keep checking it every 2-3 minutes until the center was set.  I took the advice of another cook and added peanut butter chips.  It was great!!  This cake does not require any glaze or icing.  It is very rich and moist on its own. I would definitely make this again.

All I can say is OH MY WOW!! I hosted Christmas Dinner this year and made this cake. Everyone had a piece or two. I changed the type of cake mix I used super moist chocolate cake instead of devils food, and instead of chocolate chips I used ande's mints creme de menthe baking chips. I made 3 small round cakes to make it a layered cake. For the frostings I used Cream Cheese #2 for the filling and Chocolate buttercream frosting for the outside.. both from this site. Wonderful cake! Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was a very good chocolate cake. I found that when I dusted it with the powdered sugar even after it was completely cooled the powdered sugar just soaked in, better to add it just when serving. Next time I may try drizzling with a white glaze instead. It would also be great with vanilla icecream!

This cake was awesome!  I made it with regular sized chocolate chips and they didn't melt all the way, so next time I will definitely use mini ones like most reviews recommend... and maybe some peanut butter frosting.. Mmmm!

My family loved it - I made 26 monster cupcakes out of this recipe and glazed the tops with chocolate ganache. I altered the recipe a little, using half a cup of oil and half a cup of naturally set yoghurt, and the cake came out wonderfully moist and tender (though it was a little on the sweet side for some) Next time I will try adding a little liqour. Thanks for the recipe!

This was soooo good! It was moist, dense and very chocolately! I served it as a dessert for our Christmas dinner along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Everyone loves this cake! I took another commenter's advice and I used mini- chocoate chips. The cake stays moist and you can pop it in the microwave for a few seconds and it remelts the chips in the cake. Great with a large cup of milk.

One of my favorite desserts is chocolate cake.  This truly is a classic recipe that every baker should have in their recipe collection. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze and was in complete chocolate bliss. The only thing remaining was a cold glass of milk.  Yum!

This recipe is delicious!  I used a whole wheat flour cake mix and it was the raved about by my whole family.  Definitely a keeper!!!  I also followed the suggestions of others and used mini chocolate chips instead of regular size.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic.  I made two 9" rounds that I iced and stacked.  My husband loved, loved, loved this cake.  I made it for his birthday and it was beautifully moist, even on day 4 when we finally finished it.  I'm looking forward to making this in other flavour combos- So good.

I made this for my husband and daughter because they love chocolate.  I'm not crazy about chocolate cake...BUT I LOVED THIS!! And they did too. And as reviewers suggested, I used the chocolate glaze from this site.  Yum!  Next time I think I will add chopped walnuts to the cake or icing or both.  Thanks for sharing

I don't even like chocolate and this cake was great!  Everyone who has tried it has asked for the recipe.  It could probably use a frosting or glaze if not being eaten with ice cream.

this cake is super duper RICH!!!!!!  I made it for my friends birthday.  Instead of using the water in the recipe, I used espresso.  gave it an extra kick, and was dalish!  i myself may choose not to use chocolate chips in the cake next time.  I really didn't like the way there was a big chunk in the cake.  I like my cake to just melt in your mouth instead of really having to chomp through something.  I made a genache frosting.....OVER THE TOP!!!!

OMG - seriously the best cake I have ever had!  I sent the recipe hom to my husband who made it.  I noticed some of the (tiny) changes people made & sent it to him that way.  I told him to use a scant cup of oil, since some said it was a bit oily.  Also, he cut back the choc chips to about 1.5 cups.  It was not too oily at all!  And, the very best part was that he iced it all over w/ homemade choc frosting (just cocoa, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, milk).  INCREDIBLE!!  And my favorite choc cake now!!!

You must enjoy dark chocolate to really love this cake.  I wasn't a huge fan.  I made according to recipe directions.  I think it was too  much dark chocolate for me.  I prefer "normal" chocolate cake to this recipe.

Yum, yum!  Fabulous recipe and so easy! I'd made the Chocolate Lover's Chocolate Cake from this site for two years, but tried this thinking it might be a little lighter (less sour cream).  I did use MINI chocolate chips - 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and one semi-sweet - and this worked really well for us.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a friend after she had surgery.  Can I say MMMMM! GOOD!  I did only use 1/2 cup of oil as recommended in other reviews.  Turned out great.  I am making it again today for a church dinner tomorrow and adding the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.  YUMMY!!  This is now a staple at my house!

I did not think this recipe was as great as everyone raved.  We ate the cake the day after I baked it and it just didn't have that "wow" effect I wanted.  It was good, just not what I was expecting.  I think it would have been much better had we eaten it warm the day it was baked.

I followed the recipe exactly (at higher altitude) and came out with a perfect cake. I also baked it at a normal altitude and baked it for 65 minutes. It was a delicious cake!

This was really good if you are a chocolate lover! I made it for my bf, who LOVES chocolate, for his b-day. I def. recommend using mini chips. The batter is very thick so the chips stay intact throughout the cake. I used a devils food pudding (small pkg) and it worked fine. The baking time was longer for me, but it could've just been my oven. I finished the cake with a choc. ganache. Yum!

This is a very good cake....made the recipe as written....it's really chocolaty, and very moist.  I'm not into semi-sweet chocolate very much, but wanted to try the recipe as written, but next time, will substitute milk chocolate cake and milk chocolate chips into the recipe.

I made this cake for a dinner party last evening and it was incredible! I used 3/4 c veg. oil and I used the mini chocolate chips, but other than that, I made no changes to the recipe. I had to cook mine a bit longer than the recipe said to get the middle done all the way, but it wasn't a problem. I just popped it back in the oven for 15 minutes, no big deal. Everyone loved  it, saying it was so moist and tasted amazing. Thanks for a great recipe.

Shoot! I didn't realize that the recipe called for the large box of pudding until after I had the cake in the oven. Still I'm going to give it 5* with hopes that it will still be wonderful :) I also decided to use the Satiny glaze that others suggested. When it comes time to eat this I'm confident it won't disappoint.

Great recipe. I also did what others do with 1/2c of oil and 1/3c of milk instead of 1c of oil and I put the 1c of mini chocolate chips and tossed it in flour I thought it would help so that the chips will melt all over the cake and not mostly on the bottom. It was just perfect. Leave it for overnight and the next day is even better!!

I made this with 1 cup chocolate chips but otherwise as the recipe stated.  it has to be the moistest, fudgiest cake I've ever had.

My husband and I are not huge fans of chocolate cake (made it for my son's birthday, as he requested chocolate cake) but we both loved it. Will be making this again.

I made cupcakes instead of cake. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil, and mini chocolate chips. I adjusted thebake time to 23 minutes at 325 (using a convection oven). Delicious!

This is one of those cakes that taste best the day they are made.

I'm currently cooking this cake now...I wanted to make this recipe, but I didn't have the pudding mix or semi-sweet chips available, so I improvised. I used the devil's food cake mix, 3/4 c. sour cream, 1/2 c. Veg. Oil, 1/2 c. water, 1 tablespoon vanilla, 3 eggs and 2 c. milk choc. chips. 350 in 12x2 pan for 35 minutes...let's see what happens.

Great recipe - I cut back the oil (to about 3/4 cup)and still got comments on how moist it was. Just add water in place of the oil you leave out. Its the new favorite request for birthday parties!

Yum! We are not huge fans of chocolate cakes in my home, aside from my son but this cake was delicious. Only changes I made were...used 1/2 cup oil & 1/2 cup applesauce rather than 1 full cup oil. Only used 1 cup of semisweet morsels (used mini size). Great recipe!

It was pretty good but the cake had so much icing that it was hard to taste the cake.  I used the small chocolate chips and they melted in the cake and made it moist.  I would recommend the small chips

Just made this cake for a friend's B-day. I'm not a big chocolate fan but she requested a "chocolate, chocolate...cake". Well, this one delivered! AND, I, along with a handful of other "not big chocolate fans" helped her devour it. I topped it with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" (also from this site and ridiculously easy to make; made it in the microwave as many reviewers suggested). This cake was moist and delicous and surprisingly not too sweet. Go Figure? Don't be surprised if this one should require a little more baking time. My Jenn-Air always bakes to perfection and is usually right on target with suggested baking times. However, with this one, I had to bake an extra 10-15 minutes. Aside from having to bake a little longer, I followed the recipe to a "T" and have no suggestions for improvement. Except, whenever a recipe calls for vegetable oil, I always use Canola oil...it's just better for ya.

Excellent!!   I put the chocolate chips in my mixing bowl from the start and the recipe turned out great - no need to add them at the end if you're in a rush.  Really moist - mine took 55 minutes and it was perfect.

I made this cake twice in two days.  The second one I took to my daughter's office to win her some friends, and it did the trick!  It took an hour to bake it, both times, but it was not overdone.  I tried it with creamy chocolate frosting but want to do a white vanilla icing next time.

OH MY GOSH!  This cake is to die for.  It is soooooooo moist!  It doesn't even need frosting.  I just sprinkled some powered sugar on top.  Let it sit in the bundt pan for awhile before flipping it over. I left it in for at least an hour, although I did take a knife and run along the edges right after I removed it from the oven.  Definitely a keeper!  Excellent cake!

AMAZING cake!! very dense, moist, and very chocolatey! :D

taken advice from previous posts: (1) use 1/2 cup of veggie oil, (2) 1 cup of MINI chocolate chips so they don't sink, (3) 1/3 cup of milk


ENJOY! :D

I made this cake for my sister's birthday to have on 9/20/2008.  It went over VERY well!  I followed the recipe to a "t" and it turned out perfectly.  I, like many others, topped it off with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  Thank you for sharing!

I finally found a great recipe to enhance the boxed cake mix. I cut back on the oil as others had suggested and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  It came out great!  I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site that others had also suggested.  The combination is excellent.

WOW!  The best chocolate cake I have had in A LONG TIME! This tastes much better than my local bakery.  I used lowfat sour cream and I only had two 1.7 oz. boxes of chocolate pudding mix.  It worked!  I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze on top, which made it awesome!  I have chocolate "issues" and this definitely satisfies my cravings for chocolate!  This was the easiest recipe to make and I will keep it in my recipe box FOREVER!  Thanks so much!

Made the cake as directed, except substituted organic whole milk plain yogurt for sour cream. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday cake over Labor Day weekend, thinking it was just going to be for us two. We got an impromptu invite to a party, which requested we bring dessert. I only had made a half-recipe, so I ended up cutting it into itty-bitty slices, but complete strangers RAVED about how moist/chocolately the cake was. They licked the plate. Awesome compliment!! My go-to chocolate cake recipe hands down!

This is an amazing chocolate cake. I followed the recipe exactly and the result was delicious. I made this for a BBQ and everyone raved about it. This is a very easy cake to make and the results are outstanding. I didn't use any frosting, simply dusted with powdered sugar. It is very moist and chocolatey.

This is by far the richest and moistest chocolate cake I've every had. It was wonderful! I put a little bit of chocolate icing on the sides and topped it with fresh raspberries and powdered sugar. Beautiful!

This is really a prize winning cake!  Only thing I changed was the pudding size.  All I had on hand was 3.9 oz. and it was still great.  All guests at the party loved it.  I will be making it again and again.  Will also try it with different flavors of cake, puddings, and chips.  Thanks, Denise for a great cake recipe!

Great Cake!  Everyone loved it.  I will use this from now on.. I will knock the time down 10 minutes.  It got a little to done for my liking.  But other than that.. it was GREAT!  I used the silky glaze that everyone else said to use.. then threw strawberries over it.  it goes well with black coffee.  Thanks so much!

If you want compliments, make this cake. I followed the recipe exactly and topped it with the chocolate ganache recipe on this site. It is not overly sweet and is wonderfully paired with vanilla frozen custard or ice cream. Could work for a upscale dinner party or a casual get together. Looks like you spent much more time on it than you did.

I made this cake exactly as written and it was delicous!  I'm really having a hard time holding off on making it again.  I was very chocolately and moist and my husband said it tasted like it came from a bakery.  I followed others advise and topped with the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site.

I tried this cake out on my husband who raves about it and asks me to make it for every occassion!  We love to make it with the "dark chocolate" cake mix!  My co workers demanded the recipe, but tell me that I still need to bake it for them, as they do not enjoy baking.  One of my friends, pays me to make it for her church functions and book club, and bible study groups!  Thanks for this moist, dense, rich and yummy recipe.  Its a keeper!

I made this cake according to the recipe and was pleasantly amazed at how easy it was! I made it for a party and it was raved over! I did not cover with powdered sugar, I made a simple ganache and poured over the cake. It looked magazine quality!

Oh my word--this cake is one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever eaten and so easy to make!  The first time I made it I used a devil's food cake mix, 3.9 oz pkg. of devil's food instant chocolate pudding, 1 bag of mini chocolate chips and the rest of the recipe as is.  It was moist and delicious and my family LOVED it!!!  The second cake (one week later) I used 1/2 c. oil, 1/3 c. milk and substituted strong black coffee for the water which gave it an even deeper chocolate flavor. Can't wait to try variations with different flavors.  This is now my standard cake recipe.  Thank you for this one!!!!!!

This was the BEST chocolate cake. I always try to make the recipe as is, but I love to alter a bit. The only thing I did different was using chocolate chunks, rather than chips. They kept there shape after baking, and it was a nice to bit into a chocolate chunk!

This was absolutely fantastic!! I made this for my sister and my nephews birthday, and everyone devoured every bit of it! If anyone is worried about the amount of oil in it, I made the mistake of adding 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of oil instead of the other way around and it was still as moist as it could possibly be!! I added the cream cheese frosting II from this site and my god was it good!! It's a must try!!

Loved this recipe!  Made it for a family get together and it was soo good!  I used the satiny glaze recipe that many reviewers recommended and that too was wonderful.  Added some raspberries to the final product!!  Now all my family wants the recipe!  I'm sure this will be something that I make again and again.

OMG this cake is amazing!  I made it for a neighborhood party.  My neighbors are not big dessert eaters so I was excited to have leftovers.  Only problem, this cake is so good there weren't any.  I was sad to see that last piece taken.

Made this for a dinner party yesterday. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly. Be sure to let the cake cool for the full 1 1/2 hours to allow it to release cleanly.  Topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site, and filled the center with fresh raspberries.  Beautiful and delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I'll be making this one again and again.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

if there was a higher score for this, you better believe it would receive it. I followed the recipe, however i used half mini chips and half regular chips. Also for the topping i made a semi-sweet chocolate and white chocolate ganache (spelling?). just melted chocolate and heavy cream. The reactions i got from this cake were by far the best ever! yum!

This cake is really moist and choco-tastic. I made it for a birthday, and everyone loved it! Highly recommended.

OH MY GOD!!! This cake was divine- decadent and gooey and was gone, devoured before I could blink. A huge hit at my house. I added a chocolate glaze and strwaberries to finish it off for an office party. I think my boss will give me a raise after this one! Thanx so much for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was the BEST cake I have EVER had in my life! It is moist, gooey, and almost brownie-like. I cannot wait to try this out at all my family parties. I might have added 1/2 a cup more chocolate chips, but that's just because I love chocolate!

OMG---this cake is requested all the time!! It's even been chosen over an icecream cake!! 
Use Jello pudding and not generic!  I also use Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate chips which makes it not so sweet.  
It's easy, throw it in a bowl and beat.  Very THICK batter so beware!  Don't over beat and careful when pouring into the bundt.  I cook it for 45 minutes.  I also don't let it cool in the bundt.  I find it to me more moist that way.

I made this into cupcakes for my son's 2nd birthday. They were a huge hit! So tasty, and super easy, too. I frosted them using the Cream Cheese frosting II recipe on this website. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it is truly a keeper!

Absolutely the best cake around. I have made so many different types of chocolate cake, none of which I really liked. If you need a chocolate cake that both adults and kids will like this is the one.

I loved this recipe! I made two. The first one I made for my family and the other for the church potluck. I left both of these cakes in the oven for 40 minutes instead of 50, I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips, and I used coffee instead of water to make this cake even more moist! Yum!!!!

My chocoholic hubby loved this cake!  He's crazy about cake with tons of frosting, but I lightly drizzled a thin ganache over this and he loved it!  So did the rest of the family, so it's definitely a keeper!

I am the ultimate chocolate connoisseur and this recipe really is an amazing one.  Thank you for sharing!  Absolutely delicious and easy to make for any cooking level.  I actually halved the recipe and made one 9 inch cake. I frosted it with the following icing: 1/4 c melted butter, 1 c melted chocolate chips, 2 c confectioners sugar and 2-3 tbsp half and half.  Absolutely divine.

This was a fantastic recipe!!!  My husband is a chocoholic and so I decided to make this cake for his 45th birthday.  I didn't make any substitutions at all.  I felt a little guilty serving/eating such a high calorie, rich cake, but only for a minute.  :)  My husband was extremely happy and asked me to make it again.

OH MY GOSH!!!! If you want a recipe that everyone will be talking about this is the one!!!!  Nothing need to be change on the instructions.  The only thing I add is a Chocolate Ganache.  If you look on this website they have a great one (except I leave out the rum for the children of course)!!!!

This cake was good, not spectacular.  I liked it better the second day though because the chocolate chips cooled.  I also frosted the cake, just my preference.

i accidentally bought reduced sugar cake mix and was forced to use it. everyone reved about this cake, but i wasnt a big fan. it was too moist and dense and it tasted uncooked. but i will be making it again because everyone loved it so much, but i will for sure buy regular mix next time.

Wonderful cake, very rich, doesn't need frosting or toppings. Made for a family birthday & everyone loved it. I will be trying the same recipe only with white cake, white chocolate pudding & chips. This one is a keeper.

WOW!  This is serious chocolate!  I took another reviewers tip and used 1/2 cup brewed coffee rather than the warm water, and this cake was everything I hoped--SUPER rich and chocolatey.  I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze, and served with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Heavenly :)

I made this for a grilling get together and it turned out well.  The cake was good, but not what I expected.  I thought it would be more dense and moist.  I also melted the chocolate chips because I do not like chocolate chips in cakes.  I only used 1 1/3 cups of chocolate chips since they were melted.  The batter was very thick and had an almost pudding- like consistency.  Maybe next time I'd use the smaller box of pudding.

Yum...this is my go to cake I make for everything. I have experimented with different flavors. I have done a vanilla cake with white chocolate. I have also done a chocolate cake with peanut butter chips, as someone else suggested. It is easy to make into a layer cake because the cake is nice and dense, too. I will never use another cake recipe!

This was a great recipe.  Because I could not bring myself to pour a whole cup of oil in there, I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil.  I also used light sour cream.  It came out very moist and I just dusted it with powdered sugar.  I am sure by doing the regular version it would have been even more delicious, but this was great as it was.  Thank you!!

My husband doesn't usually like sweets, but he raved over this cake.  I did not change a thing.  It stayed fresh for the 3 days it took for us to eat it.  Will definitely be making again.

Most delicious after it sits for a few days! I would love a version of this recipe that employs the ingredients found in cake mix instead of using cake mix. Made it with chocolate ganache.

1st let me say I hate when reviewers change a recipe then rate it, but I only had 3.125oz instant pudding and low fat sour cream and I was DYING for some chocolate cake. It was fabulous even with the alterations. P.S. I over baked it by 5 minutes too!

This is the best Chocolate cake I have had in a long time.  Very moist although lots of calories!  I followed the recipe exactly and made it in a bundt pan.  I sprinkle powdered sugar on cake just before serving.  Adults and kids both raved over this cake.  I managed to take home the last piece for my teenage son. The choclate chips did not sink to the bottom of the pan.  The stayed nicely throughout the cake.

OMG is this cake good, and as so easy to make and clean up after!  I used about 1/4 less oil than the recipe called for and used the mini chips as others suggested, but it was plenty moist.  I dusted with powdered sugar (I think a chocolate glaze would have made it to sweet for me) Will make again!

I have tears of joy streaming down my face right now, and I made so many alterations to this recipe, I can't imagine how much BETTER it will be to make it as is! *sigh* When you're pregnant and want chocolate, make this. I mean it. My alterations/substitutions (because I was out of almost everything):

- No chocolate chips
- Used 4T egg whites from a carton, the kind that are purely egg whites, no yolk or yellow coloring
- 1/2 c oil & 1/2 c heavy whipping cream instead of 1 c oil
- 3.9 oz box of instant choco pudding instead of 5.9

And yet, after all that, STILL so moist, so delicious and dense yet 'fluffy'! And what cake mix flavor? Maybe my pregnant taste buds are dead, but this was the best chocolate cake ever! Yippee! Will make this over and over again!

Excellent cake, perfect for chocoholics!  I pretty much made the recipe as is, but used a little over half a cup of oil only but it was still supermoist!  i will definitely try next time to do the dark chocolate....but this one is good its not overly sweet at all...and i didnt have a problem w/ my chocolate chips sinking to the bottom, as a matter of fact, i just dumped the whole bag in, not sure if that's more than 2 cups or not, oh well!  Great recipe for when i've got the urge for chocolate....  thanks again!

Very, very chocolate-y! Super easy to make as well. I used a 3.9 oz box of instant pudding. I made Satiny Chocolate Glaze (recipe on this website) to put on top but the cake definitely can stand on its own; that's how moist and rich it is.

Even with my error of using the smaller box of chocolate pudding, this came out great (probably less sweet and not as gooey).  I also made it into cupcakes.  It looked like smaller Costco chocolate muffins, but so much better.  Calling it "muffins" makes it okay to eat it for breakfast!  It is the best slightly warmed up in the microwave, 15 sec. at 50% power.

I made this in 9x13 and frosted with butter cream frosting and then used stencils and sprinkled Hershey cocoa on it. It was a huge hit at my daughters bday, everyone was asking to take some home and fighting over leftovers. I am not a cake person, but this was good and chocolaty!

This recipe is awesome...I used white chocolate chips rather than the chocolate ones. Next time I would not put in any chocolate chips, I would use strong coffee instead of the water and replace half the oil with yogurt or applesause. I would also drop the temp down for baking as the outside of mine was a bit dry. I brought it to a church picnic and it was a hit. I did put a chocolate glaze on it. I will make this many times over.

Wow. This cake is delicious. I baked it in a 9x13 pan. When I took it out of the oven, I pressed the air out of the cake with a spatula, making it even on top. I covered it with a dish towel to cool, holding in the steam to keep it moist. I made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site to spread on top. It was great while still a little warm, with ice cream. Thanks for the new keeper.

I just had to add my 2cents as this is the BEST chocolate cake!  I made it twice in two weeks and company both times demanded the recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  Too easy and too good as is.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was great!  It was no homemade cake, which is the only reason it didn't get a 5, but it was great!  This is definantly the recipe to go too if you don't have time to make a from scratch cake!

Great death-by-chocolate-type cake!  Every chocolate ingredient called for in this recipe I used the dark variety.  Plus I topped it with the chocolate ganache from this site which is also made with dark chocolate.  Would you like some more chocolate with your chocolate?!

I made this for my husband's 30th birthday and everyone couldn't get enough! It taste like it came from a restaurant!! I love this cake... the only thing I did different was I added 1 cup of choc. chips instead of 2 cups. I think you can taste a difference of not having enough chocolate chips in it but only I could tell. This cake taste extra yummy when it is warm! I will be making it again very very soon!

I made this for my daughter's 7th birthday.  She (and everyone else) LOVED it!!  Very good.  She even asked me to make another one so she could take it to school to share with her friends.  Served it with chocolate glaze (from this site too) and fresh berries.  What a hit!!  Thanks.

This cake is quick and easy to make and tastes delicious. I made it for my husband's birthday. He and my older son said it tastes like an intense brownie. I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site as other reviewers suggested. I also suggest serving with fresh sliced strawberries on top or raspberries to complement the sweetness.  I used a stone fluted pan and it took longer to cook. The outside top got a bit overdone before the inside was set. That's the only reason for a 4 versus a 5.

This was so delicious and easy!  I made this for Mother's Day for both my mom and mom in law.  I followed the recipe and made the following changes according to other reviewers: used about 2 cups of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and I substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 the oil. The baking time took longer in my bundt pan and I turned down the temp near the end. It was so moist.  I used powdered sugar as the recipe said.  I think if I had used a glaze it would have been too much.  It stayed moist for days out of the refrigerator.  This is a definite keeper.  The next time I make it I will probably use low fat sour cream to make it less fat.

I loved this recipe. I brought it to work and it was gone within a hour. Everybody begs me to make it again. I used the glaze recipe that goes along with the cake, and it was super easy and really yummy. Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely Amazing! But if the cake is for adults, I would consider making the batter without chocolate chips--a little more sophisticated, but still as good

Used regular size chocolate chips. Used coffee instead of warm water. Used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of milk. 9 x 13 pan for 50 min. Make sure when you test for doneness, you do not hit a warm wet chocolate chip and keep baking. Super easy and very good.

Absolutely fabulous!  I used a spring form bundt pan that made extracting the cake very simple.  I'd agree that mini chocolate morsels are better if you don't like the sensation of a chunk of chocolate in every bite of cake.  My DD wanted chocolate frosting (her b-day choice), which was great as a glaze, but definitely not necessary.  Next time we'll dust with the powder.
Thanks for a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  Very simple to make and comes out beautifully.  I followed the directions as is, and had no problems.  I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site as some one else had suggested and it makes a beautiful presentation.

I gave it a 4 because I thought it was way too sweet. I do plan on cooking it again after I buy a bundt pan. Because I cooked it in the loaf pan I don't think it came out just right.

I did this recipe as is.  The morsels threw it off for me.  I should have listened to another who used mini morsels but now, they have to go! I had this deliciously created cake and then I'd get a nasty taste of cocoa from the morsels.  The morsels did not blend well for my tastes (although they melted) with the other chocolates.  They were like the 3rd uninvited guest coming to ruin the party.  I'm not giving up though: I am going to make it again (it is good, worth it *and* sweet!) but with OUT the morsels. I know it will be a keeper of a recipe!

whoa, this was amazing-it really does live up to its name. I followed the recipe exactly. This looks very pretty in the bundt pan sprinkled with powdered sugar. *UPDATE* I made this again and was out of sour cream so I used nonfat yogurt instead. Tasted the same and I saved a lot of calories.

Great cake.  Very rich (as if the title doesn't give that away).

I dusted with powdered sugar and threw some fresh raspberries on.

Very easy to make.  Super moist.  Good flavor.  Worth it to take the extra minute to do this recipe instead of just a regular old cake mix out of the box.

This is delicious- I followed the advice of using the mini chips and the satiny glaze. It was a hit at the party I went to- we all could not stop eating it. I will definitely make this again!

This was a huge hit with my chocolate-loving boyfriend.  It was almost too chocolatey for me, but I managed to put away quite a bit of it with a glass of milk.  Definitely looking forward to trying this again soon with different pudding combinations.  I might try melting the chocolate chips down some next time, as I'm not sure if I like the hard bits.

This was the best cake I have ever made or tasted.  It was very moist and wonderful.  My daughter requested it for her birthday.  I used the mini chips and frosted it with the satiny glaze on this sight.  Will make this again and again as it is so simple.

I made this for an after dinner dessert for my boyfriend and sister and they LOVED it. My sister (who loves chocolate cake) stated that it was the best chocolate cake she had ever eaten and now wants it made for her b-day! Since it was just the three of us I took what was left of the cake to work and got even more raves on my delicious cake. On one note- I would wait several hours if not a whole night's sleep before serving and eating. Seemed to taste even better the next day. -Delish!!! PS. I also used the chocolate topping as everyone else- use it- tastes phenomenal.

Excellent, moist and definitely chocolate.  Used this for cupcakes and made a light marshmallow icing (7 minute frosting) to frost the tops.  Perfect.

This is an awesome chocolate cake recipe.  If you are a chocoholic, this cake is for you.  Just to make it even more chocolatey (if that is possible), I split the batter into two round pans.  In between the cakes, I used the chocolate genache recipe to make icing, not genache(with milk choc chips, and no alcohol).  Then to add even more richness, I used the same genache recipe and did dark chocolate genache and poured it over the entire cake.  It is the most chocolatiest thing ever!!

I made this recipe exactly as is. It was so good! At first, my husband didn't really like it as he thought it tasted more like a brownie. I refrigerated it overnight (wasn't sure if had to but since it had sour cream, I thought it probably needed to be) and the next day it tasted so much better. My husband is now hooked on this cake! This recipe will be a staple in our cookbook. Thanks for sharing.

The Best Chocolate Cake I Ever Had.  So easy to make, and so rich and moist.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Delicious. Great with Satiny Choc. Glaze, as another reviewer suggested.  This will be my go-to chocolate cake from now on.  THANK YOU!

VERY chocolatey! This cake is so delicious. My first slice, I made myself sick trying to eat a piece too big! I regretted it all evening but couldn't wait to have another (smaller) piece!
I had to deliver slices of it to my neighbors who asked for the recipe. I think this recipe would be just fine without the chocolate chips since it's to sweet for hubby. Thanks for a great recipe!

Amazingly easy to make and yummy cake! I frosted mine with Creamcheese frosting and added some leftover mini chips on top. I have made this cake a few times and with/without frosting it is a true crowd pleaser!!!

I thought this was a really good cake-and I don't like chocolate cake because it is usually dry-this one defies that completely!  I used coffee for the water and used half heavy cream and half oil for the oil part.  I also used mini chips and smothered the cake with ganache-it was wonderful!

Awesome cake!  Just like a big chocolate, chocolate chip muffin.  Plan to try vanilla and lemon cake variations!

This was really good.  I will say that it didn't need to cook as long as the recipe calls, maybe 5 minutes less.  

Also, I added a pretty/sweet touch.  I melted a half cup of the semi-sweets over the stove and then drizzled it over the strawberries and confectioners sugar topping.  It looked really nice, and made the strawberries so yummy.  

Best eaten right out of the oven.

BIG HIT at my luncheon!!!  I followed the directions exactly as written and my cake came out perfect.  I covered it with the Satin Chocolate Glaze recipe as recommended by others.  I love this recipe and am going to forward to all my girlfriends.  Thanks for posting!

This was great! I only had vanilla instant pudding, so I used that and added and extra 1/4 c sweetened cocoa powder and it turned out wonderfully. Surprisingly moist. My go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on!

Great recipe. You could do a lot of different variations. I used a german chocolate cake mix, low fat sour cream, 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup of  oil. Just to lighten the recipe up a bit. It turned out fantastic. My husband said it was the best chocolate cake he has ever had. Just don't tell his mom.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and him and his friends loved it so much that I didn't even get to try a piece! But they raved about it even after it was gone, so I'm giving it 5 stars. I drizzled heated chocolate frosting (from the store) and put fresh raspberries. It looked like I'd bought it from the store. Very impressive, and easy to make. Hope I get a piece next time I make it!

I don't know what happened!  I made the cake exactly as directed except I baked in my convection oven for 40-45 minutes. It looked beautiful when I first took it out of the oven.  An hour later the the middle had collapsed.  It was still gooey in the middle.  Don't think I'll make it again.

Loved it so much that I've made it over and over again. I find that mini chips work the best. I mostly made mini and half size bundt versions in December for Christmas presents. I used mint flavored chips for these. We ended up eating many of the ones we were going to give away so we had to make more!! It is so rich that it doesn't need frosting, but is even more awesome when you do frost.

Used this recipe in my special edition Nordicware "Fairytale" pan... it came out beautiful and tasty.  It is super easy to make, just pour all the ingredients in your mixer, pour into pan, and you've got a dessert that looks like you've spent hours on.  Definitely going to use this recipe from now on for my chocolate-lover friends.

this cake was delicious.  I served it for a dinner party and everyone raved.  I put the pieces onto plates and warmed them in the microwave, served them with ice cream and the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site right off the stove.  It tasted like a restaurant dessert!  

I made it as is this time but I'm looking forward to trying it with different variations - esp. the rasp. sauce!

I have made this several times. It is always a hit. Usually make in mini bundt pans, cover with a chocolate glaze, and add a raspberry sauce on the side. Looks like so much work but really minimal effort

Very good. and Very chocolatey. If you layer brownies and cookies in the middle its WONDERFUL! It was not necessary to allow and hour to cool. I only let it sit for 15 minutes and it came out perfect.

It was good and easy. I used mini chips- about 1 cup. and only 2/3 cup of the oil- probably could get away with only 1/2 cup.It was a good cake but not a "wow" cake.

Five stars are not enough! This is an incredibly easy recipe yet amazingly moist and chocolaty.  I used the mini chips as someone suggested, which resulted in tiny morsels of chocolate distributed throughout the cake.  I served this as the dessert at a dinner party and my guests just raved over it. A real hit.

This is truly the easiest and yummiest chocolate cake ever! I add a chocolate glaze over the ridge of the bundt cake which makes it look fancier and even more attractive. Great gift to the neighbors and cowarkers!

A BIG HIT! I MADE THIS RECIPE FOR THE FIRST TIME F0R A FRIEND AND HER FAMILY. SHE SAID THAT IT WAS THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE SHE'D EATEN IN MANY YEARS. SHE AND HER HUSBAND ATE THE CAKE FOR DESSERT THE FIRST NIGHT & BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING, CAUSE IT WAS SO GOOD. WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN. ONLY CHANGE--DID NOT DO POWDERED SUGAR, INSTEAD MELTED CHOCOLATE CHIPS, BUTTER & VANILLA IN A PAN AND DRIZZLED ON CAKE, THEN TOPPED WITH MORE CHOCOLATE CHIPS. YUM!

I made this cake for my family's Christmas party and there was none left at the end of the night!!  I couldn't find a 5.9 oz. box of pudding so I used 1 1/2 3.9 oz. boxes and I used the Satin glaze on this site as suggested by other reviewers. It was amazing!

I made this for one of my best friend's birthdays, and everyone loved it. Very chocolately. Instead of powdered sugar, I melted chocolate cake frosting and poured it over the top so it dripped down the side. It made a nice presentation.

Very good.  Rich but not too sweet.  Next time I will serve smaller pieces because it has to be a million calories per cake!  Sooo good.  I also used mini chocolate chips but other than that followed the recipe exactly.

This cake was wonderful!  Made it for Thanksgiving this past year and everyone loved it.  It's very true what one reviewer said about variations.  You can interchange the box cake mix flavor and the chips flavors and it usually works.  I practiced using a spice cake with vanilla pudding and chocolate chips that was great.  For the big day I used a dark fudge cake mix, fudge pudding, and peanut butter chips.  Both were very well liked!  Have fun!

This is a great chocolate cake recipe. Hides the "cake mix" taste well. Stays fresh for days and is good cold or at room temp. I top with ganache - it is my husbands favorite cake and his birthday cake request. I also substitute cold coffee for the warm water. Adds a little complexity.

The best chocolate cake of its kind.  It is simultaneously dark, rich, and not too heavy.  I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site--great pairing.

Be careful when you buy the instant pudding, because the weight of the boxes tends to vary.  I got a large chocolate with toffee chips that was 4.25 oz, so I added a small box of fudge pudding.  I used a dark chocolate cake mix and a mixture of white and milk chocolate chips.

The cake seemed pretty simple to make and it tasted wonderful, but I had to let it cook for about 30 minutes longer before it got done.  I just moved into an apartment so maybe I haven't quite gotten the feel for the oven temperature yet.  Other than that this cake was magnificent!  I topped it with melted white chocolate, raspberry puree, and some chocolate curls, it was wonderful! I will make it again and again!

A good, moist cake.  Very chocolately without being too sweet, which is fantastic.  My one concern is that I think there is too much oil in the cake -- while the oil makes it moist, there is also a bit of an aftertaste and the texture reflects the oil content.  I don't know enough about baking to understand how to keep the moisture but get rid of the oil aftertaste.  Would appreciate some suggestions for oil alternatives. I used a basic vegetable oil (Wesson Best Blend).  Thanks to anyone who can offer help!

absolutely fantastic basic cake recipe. I could play with variations of this forever! I didn't realiaze until I started to make it that I needed a big pudding packet instead of the small one (what I bought) so I just used a little less oil and it still turned out wonderfully!

Very good.  I used a dark bundt cake pan, cooked it for 50 minutes and the outer edge was a little dry.  Will reduce cooking time a little next time.

I followed the recipe as written, with the only modification being to substitute 1 cup of butterscotch chips for 1 of the cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips, as well as using two 9x9 inch cake pans. I also changed the cooking time from the listed 50 minutes to a little under 45 minutes. That, also, was a bit on the high side, as the corners of the cakes are a bit on the crunchy side. All in all, I like the taste of this cake. It's not overly sweet, which is something that I like, but the chocolate flavour still shines through. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it the Best Cake Ever, and I can see where some reviewers thought it had a 'boxed cake' taste, it is nonetheless a very good cake. I'll most likely be making it again.

To die for! Sooo easy to make. Very moist and delicious. I have made this twice, once with a frosting and once with powdered sugar. I prefered without frosting. So rich, it's not needed. Heat for 15 seconds in the microwave with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, yummo!

Oh my sooooooo yummy! 
used some of the tips from other reviews: turned oven down to 325 F, used dunkin hines fudge cake mix (was on sale), used 2 cups of mini chocolate chips (semi sweet), used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup milk and topped it off with chocolate icing (betty crocker), and filled the center with strawberries.

made this cake saturday morning - tasted amazing on sunday evening when we finished it off - it was better the next day!

would not change a thing from what i did - was amazingly yummy!

I'm not usually a fan of recipes that start with a cake mix, but this is the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I also used the mini chocolate chips. I made it for an event tomorrow and 'taste tested' a slice just in case (I was planning on brining it pre-sliced). I may have to make another in the morning because the family is attacking this one. Wonderful cake, will definitely make again!!

I have made this cake many times and I am always asked for the recipe. The last time I made it for my volunteer group and there was a 15 year old boy there who ate 3 pieces and asked me to give his Mom the recipe. As far as I am concerned it should be called Exactly The Right Amount Of Chocolate Cake!

Oh My Goodness!! I made this cake for my twins' 12 birthday with a total of 15 kids at our house for a party and sleepover...these cakes were GONE in a matter of a few hours!! I made one 9x13 and one in a bundt pan as suggested. They both turned out AWESOME!! I used the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" on this site and the kids were going bananas over the cake as a whole! The chocolate chips made this cake!! I too used mini morsels it was oh so gooey!!

There were about 2 pieces left...the kids came home from school the next day...asked for the remainder of the cake...but I HAD EATEN IT!! I NEVER DO THAT! BUT IT WAS WAY TO HARD TO PASS UP!

I have 4 children and they have all asked that this be the staple birthday cake!!

Try it out! You won't be disappointed!

PS - You might want to have a tall glass of cold milk on hand!!!
Enjoy!

Made this for the Bunco girls.  WOW!
Everyone loved it.  I'm making it again this weekend for my daughter's 16th birthday. (her request)  I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze that other reviewers mentioned.

Excellent, a huge hit!  Everyone loved it!  I made it in a 9 x 13in pan and topped it with vanilla cream cheese frosting and it was incredible, and so easy.  I couldn't find 5.9 oz package of pudding, so I used one and a half packages of the 3.8oz, and it was fine, but I think even one 3.8oz would have been fine as well.  I will definately make this again and I highly recommend it!

Amazing chocolate cake.  I use this with the whipped cream frosting as a filler, and the chocolate ganache.  I also add mini chocolate chips into the cake batter.  Makes three layers and is a wonderful birthday cake.  All my kids want this on their special day.

When I make this people are so happy! It is very moist. I actually cut down the number of chocolate chips I use, just to keep it more cakey.

WOW! Everyone loved this cake.   Not a crumb left and so easy to make.  This recipe made 2 - 9in layers perfectly.  Used chocolate fudge frosing.  I didnt have vegetable oil and used canola instead.  Moist and rich, a chocolate lovers dream.

AMAZING - I can't even begin to describe how good this cake is.  I brought it to a party and it was gone in 5 minutes.  I followed the directions exactly.  I drizzled melted choc on top of the cake when it was cool.  This seriously was probably one of the best cakes I have ever made.

This cake was ridiculously delicious AND super easy.  I used the satiny chocolate glaze on the top, which is alos very simple to make, and then placed strawberries in the center and along the side of the cake, drizzling chocolate along the side as well.  It was a huge hit!!  Next time I will slice more strawberries along the side and have an extra bowl, so people can add as many as they'd like...the strawberries were a huge hit with all the chocolate!  Very Very Tasty.

Best Chocolate cake ever.  I have made this numerous times and receive tons of compliments each time.  I use the mini chocolate chips for best results.  Don't be afraid to use the full amount of oil.

Moist, gooey, chocolatey, and DELICIOUS! I had a little mint chocolate chip ice cream on the side of mine. :) I followed the recipe exactly and I don't think anything should be changed. Except I accidentally bought a 3.9 ounce package of pudding mix when the recipe calls for a 5.9 ounce package. It still turned out great.

This cake was wonderful...and so easy!  Followed the recipe exactly, it took exactly 55 minutes in my oven.  I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze as other reviews suggested.  Whipped the glaze up in the microwave in no time and it was just the right consistancy....the drips went all the way down the cake without pooling on the plate....I will make this cake for my son's 18th birthday party...I know that everyone will love it.  Thanks!

This is pretty good. It was VERY chocolaty and rich. Unfortunately, I'm sure it is also VERY fattening...lol! :)

This is the best chocolaty chocolate moist rich cake you will ever eat.  Great with or without icing.  I made it with a chocolate ganache icing from this website.  I can't tell you how fabulous this cake was.  The texture is soft, moist, spongy, and is the perfect amount of chococolatey.  I used mini chocolate chips and i was very pleased at how they blended in with the inherent texture of the cake.  Again, STRONGLY recommend this recipe and i don't think i'll ever make any other chocolate bundt cake recipe other than this one ever again.    Enjoy!

My husband and I made this cake last night.  It turned out perfect and was very tasty.  will be making it again.
Thanks Denise for sharing this recipe.
I have one question, in the directions on the time of baking you had bake at 5 to 55 minutes. so I had to add the 5 to the 55 so that the cake would be done...
I'm sure it was an error.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  Could even use 1 cup of choc. chips & it still would be moist & choclatey. I will make this again for sure but as a special treat -- Watch out for those calories in this one though - 598c & 37 grams of fat!

Anytime my brothers and I had to bring cupcakes to school this is the kind my Mom made. She never added sour cream to hers, so I probably wouldn't do that now. This brought back tons of sweet childhood memories, thanks!

OMG!!! This IS a really good recipe. Everyone loved it. Only thing I forgot to put the chips in the mix so I sprinkled them over the top of the cake before baking. I will definately make this again. For a frosting I used Chocolate Cream Cheese frosting which is on this website.

This was the best chocolate cake that I've ever had.  Instead of using 1 cup of oil I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I also used 2 packages of fat free/sugar free pudding mix, 3/4 cup of low fat sour cream and only 1 cup of chocolate chips.  It was great eaten warm with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe that I found on the site.  I will be making this again!!

Excellent cake and super moist. I have made this sevral times with the following variations:
(1)used Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix and eliminated the chocolate chips; and
(2)used mint chocolate chips and a mint frosting.
Wonderful. A new family keeper.

I don't usually make chocolate cake. I like more to my desserts but my husband loves chocolate cake so I tried this tonight for Father's Day and it was a HUGE success. I even loved it. It was moist and light and super chocolatey! It was the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten and ever made.

A+++++. Not for the faint of heart or sugar sensitive people.  I made this for dh's b-day cake with the "White Fluffy Filling" and topped with "Chocolate Fudge Buttercream" frosting. The cake was moist and dense. Very good.

YUMMY!  This was a wonderful cake recipe.  I prepared just as stated in the recipe only substituting milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The cake had a great texture, came out of the pan perfectly, and the chocolate chips made it heavenly.  I drizzled the cake with Satiny Chocolate Glaze as others have suggested.  Definately a keeper!!!

I made this cake for our church memorial day picnic. It was fabulous! I had never made a bundt cake before so I was worried about timing it right. But I did 50 min exactly and it came out perfect. Very moist and chocolatey! I also used the velvety chocolate icing as others suggested for an extra touch. If you love chocolate you will love this cake! I will absolutely be making again just for my own family next time! It was almost completely gone!

I made this recipe for cupcakes and they came out great!  The only thing I didn't like was the chocolate chips.  It made it a bit chunky so I tried a second batch without them and it was awesome.

the only changes i made to this recipe were substituting 1/2 the sour cream with plain yogurt, used 2/3 C oil, and used mini chocolate chips.  served this at my husband's birthday and everyone loved it.  i am making it again for another birthday celebration and will try a chocolate glaze this time.

My husband was weirded out when i mentioned putting the sour creem in the cake.. but he didn't complain one bit when it was finished! 
I can see why this would win a state fair.... 20 stars from me! :)

Very rich and yummy!  I made this and ate probably half of the cake myself.  I followed it exactly except used mini chocolate chips and also topped it with the Satiny Glaze recipe that another reviewer referenced below.  It was still moist 2-3 days later.  Microwave a cake slice for a few seconds to melt the chocolate chips.  SO good!

I cannot stop eating this and I don't even LIKE chocolate cake!  I agree with the other posts to cut back on the vegetable oil. Otherwise, this is a great, chocolatey recipe.

This recipe is fantastic, especially for a semi-novice like me! Everyone who tasted it raved about the flavor and moistness!  I will make this one again and again!

This turned out pretty good. I used dark chocolate cake mix instead of devils food. I think I will add more chocolate chips in the mix next time and melt some chocolate to pour over the top-overall it was a good cake and I will make it again!

Very moist cake.  I did not have semi sweet chips, so I used butterscotch and my family really enjoyed.  Thanks

I made this cake for my son's birthday. I was excellent. Nobody could believe I made it myself. I topped it off with a cool whipped frosting that I found on this site.
