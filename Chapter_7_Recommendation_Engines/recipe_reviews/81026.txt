This is very flavorful.  I added a chopped shallot with the garlic, cooked the pasta in bouillon and added a little chicken broth.  We ate the whole thing in one night!  Excellent, one of our favorite recipes.  Thank you!

Very good!  I used navy beans instead of cannellini beans and they worked very well.

Easy to make and obviously low fat.  But I really didn't care too much for it.  The only change I made was using Dandelion greens instead of Arugula because my market didn't have any.  Seemed to make much more than 4 servings.

This js a great recipe and I customized it to be VEGAN.  I did make modifications simply because of what I had on hand.  Firstly, I had a creamy roasted red/yellow/orange peppper sauce that needed to be used.  So, I added a can of diced tomatoes to that, along with half a yellow onion, roasted garlic and garlic salt, marsala wine, arugula and Italian parsley and vegan rice macaroni.  Whether you eat meat or not, this is a great recipe that is easily adaptable to all tastes.  The fresh arugula and Italian parsley really made the difference!

Very good and easy to make.  The leftovers are great the next day tossed over baby Arugula for a cold pasta salad.

This actually turned out to be a pretty tasty dish. Like many of the other reviewers, I tend to doctor recipes (1. because I do not always have what's called for and 2. just because I can.)  The meat marinade I used was about 1/4 cup of lemon juice for a double batch (1 medium lemon, juiced). My sherry was wine, so I chose to use the sherry and red wine vinegar. I doubled the red pepper flakes. I used about 4 cloves of garlic, because more really is better, and then omitted the wine from the sauce mixture. I chose to use chicken broth and again the red wine vinegar in place of the sherry. My only bean option was small white beans, and the basil was limited to some frozen cubes of basil. Fresh may have been a bit more flavorful, but it worked out great. I simmered the liquids and the basil, tomatoes and beans for about 10-15 minutes to cook off some of the liquid. Just for good measure, I included 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp thyme, and 1 tsp red pepper flakes, salt and fresh ground pepper in the simmer. It did taste a bit spicy, but was perfect once everything came together. I did not have arugula on hand, so spinach took its place. It was a great combination, very tasty, a little bit of spice and overall a great weeknight meal that came together fairly quickly.

We didn't like this. My husband ate 2 bowls after we doctored it up but it was still just not something we liked. The flavor he couldn't quite put his finger on that he didn't like was the white wine. Same for me, only I knew what it was that I didn't like. It was bland and sour at the same time. I won't try this again as I almost never have arugula on hand, but thanks for the recipe--always learning something new!

This was delicious and will become a regular of mine.  My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it.  I love one pot dishes that are so satisfying. I did change a few things.  Cooked pasta in boullion like a reviewer suggested, substituted 1/4 cup olive oil for 1 tablespoon and remainder chicken broth (lower calorie), used spinach instead of arugula (what I had on hand), and added capers because we love them!

Yummy. This wasn't much like a stew. I had to add extra liquid just to keep it from being dry.

I really enjoyed the recipe.  I didn't use the wine. Also, I added extra pepper flake because we really like them.  Otherwise held to the recipe.  Everyone really enjoyed.  Will definately make again.

I had such high hopes.  Followed the recipe pretty much verbatim and there just wasn't much flavor there.  After making it, there's too much vinegar and pepper flakes for my taste.  Family didn't like it, either.  Big disappointment.

I have arugula growing in my garden and was looking for new ways to use it other than salads.  This is a very delicious and easy recipe to make.  I used the slow cooker, and added sliced carrots and garbonzo beans, which are relative fast to prepare from dried beans since they don'.   I added the arugula, basil, and cooked pasta to the end.  Dinner was ready when I got home from work.

This dish was fabulous!   I did do a few things different though.  I roasted chicken thighs and then pulled off the bone and cubed, instead of cubing from a tender and saut√©ing.  I did marinate the thighs in the listed ingredients first.  I also added shallots, mushrooms and spinach to this stew.  So satisfying and delicious!

I was disappointed. It didn't have much sauce and lacking in flavor. It'll be a long time before I make this again

I really liked this recipe as written but found that it needed a little additional salt. 

The second time I made this I changed the 1 cup of white wine to 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth and found the end result just perfect!

Thanks, this is delicious and a keeper!
