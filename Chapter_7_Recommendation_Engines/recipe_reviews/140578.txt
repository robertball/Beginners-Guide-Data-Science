I used one lb of ground beef that I browned with 1/4 diced onion. Instead of baked beans, I used 1 can of black beans. Topped burgers with diced tomato, lettuce and grated cheddar cheese. Just like a taco on a burger bun! Nice change!

Great recipe! Made as directed. Topped mixture with cheese, cilantro, lettuce, and tomato. Used leftover bean/beef mixture in quesadillas.

my kids hate baked beans, but they liked this! They requested less beans next time and a little more taco seasoning, but all in all it was a hit!
Update 3/11/08: Made this again and used hlf the amount of beans for the kids sake and it went over real big! Great quick recipe! Thanks!!!!

We thought this was great-not gourmet, but good in a comfort food sort of way.  The husband brought home the maple syrup flavor baked beans, I don't recommend those for this recipe.

Sloppy Joes, you are hereby evicted from my recipe rotation. The new tenant, effective immediately, is Taco Bean Burgers. I halved the recipe and served on hamburger buns, open-faced, with shredded cheddar cheese on top. DELICIOUS AND EASY.

Hubby declared this better than sloppy joes and I HAVE to make it again.  Even my 3 picky kids loved it.  I only changed it a tiny bit.  I used 1lb of hamburger and a 28oz can of baked beans.  It turned out great.

Whipped this up as a quick dinner minus the shopping.  1.5lb ground beef, a 28oz can of baked beans (country style w/ bacon bits and brown sugar), taco seasoning scrounged from my spice rack... turned out great!  Definitely a lot of room for experimenting, too, and I'm looking forward to playing around with the leftovers.

Great recipe! The only thing I change is that I add a half a can (or so) of tomato paste, and substitute half of one of the cans of baked beans with a half a can of black beans. Sometimes I also add corn and onions to stretch it a bit further. But It's also great just as-is :P

Served the kids' with rice and my husband and I used buns. Next time I'm thinking tortillas, but I like the hotdog idea.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, but after trying it as a burger, I wasn't impressed. The flavor was... strange and not very appetizing. I decided to try it on a taco salad, though, and it was much better. I think it could use a little more spicing, though.

I wasn't sure about this recipe at first, but am now convinced its a keeper. I used one pound ground beef and cooked it with about a half cup of chopped onion. I added the taco seasoning, some garlic powder and Mexican oregano after the meat was drained. Then I added a can of baked beans.  After the initial taste test, I decided it needed a little more kick, so I threw in some canned diced jalapenos, probably about a fourth to a half of one of the small cans. Served on a bun with a little shredded cheddar over the top and a side of garden tomato. Good. Next time I will use beans that are a little less sweet.

This was most excellent, what a surprise that it all works rather well. However, I would have given it a 5 star, because of taste and ease of making the recipe, I dropped one star because it was very very greasy. The meat should be drained after cooking, add a couple tablespoon of water for the taco seasoning to mix with. But all in all totally excellent recipe TOTALLY!!! I didn't use the 2 16oz cans, instead I used 1 large 28oz Vande Camp's Original Recipe baked beans.....This diffently gives a new life to a sloppy joe....I would agree this is way much better then a sloppy joe. It's a keeper in my recipe box. Y'all gotta try this one!!!!

These were good but I would have preferred to use "ranch style" beans instead of baked beans.  Next time, I will.  I am keeping this recipe as both my boys ate it.  I added a slice of cheese on the bun.

I haven't made this yet but when I do , I am going to use Chili Beans (PInto) beans instead of Baked Beans . Those would make it more Tex-Mex than using Yankee Boston Baked Beans !

Good recipe. I added chopped onion to the ground meat.  Though I'll increase seasoning next time, this was a good meal. Took the suggestion of another reviewer and served with diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce and grated cheddar.  Very quick, very satisfying.  Will make again. Thank you Wrightone.

This was great and easy! Make sure to drain your hamburger, who wants all that fat? I added one can of baked beans and one can of black beans. I also added onion and sweet corn! Topped it with shredded cheddar and it was delicious! Will make again!

I made this recipe using Taco Seasoning I from this website, and it turned out great!  Who would have thought that taco seasoning and baked beans would taste good together.  I quick made this for my husband and left it for him to eat, he thought it was chili and made himself a chili dog and loved it!  I took the leftovers and put it in a quesadilla with a little cheddar cheese, it turned out tasty.  Obviously, you can have lots of fun with this recipe.

I liked these alot and so did my family.  A nice change from the ordinary and especially good with sharp cheddar cheese and a toasted bun!  Dinner was on the table in less than 30 minutes,  too!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Yeah, it's really good. You don't really need two pounds of beef. One pound does the trick. Seems to me that it's a poor college kids dream recipes. If you need a break from Ramen, go and get the cheapest ground beef and store brand baked beans you can find and you've got yourself a weeks worth of food for about five bucks. Good recipe.

This was a little sweet. Maybe next time I will try using pork n' beans. I also added onion powder. I did not have buns on hand so I put it on my baked potato with sour cream. It was good. Others ate it plain.

Basically it's a Mexican version of a sloppy joe.   I would probably add more flavor with some peppers, onions, and pico de gallo.

I added  1/2 c. chopped onion while cooking the ground beef,  then added 1 can of baked beans and 1 can of black beans (rinsed and drained), the taco seasoning and 1 t. chili powder. Will definitely be making this again, but might play around with the seasoning a bit more.

It was super easy, however since I do not eat red meat I used ground turkey, black beans and the taco seasoning, I will make this again and I did pass this recipe on to my granddaughters.
Quick and easy!!!

Great recipe!  I halved the ground beef and used a whole packet of taco seasoning, grilled diced onions and used 1 can of chili beans instead of baked beans! Delicious! My husband loved it This ones a keeper!!

I made it exactly as directed. I did Half it since I am on my own.The taste was amazing. I served over Basmati rice since I am gluten intolerant so no bun for me. Have enough for another 2 servings. A keeper for sure. Next time I may make my own homemade beans, old fashioned stye in a crockpot slowly cooked in the oven like my dad did as I was growing up. Yum. Thanks!!!!!!

I will try this with veggie crumbles instead of beef and let you know what I think. I believe it will be very good, which is why the 3 stars. If the rating changes, I will post it.

I used black beans because I had them on hand. I was pleasantly surprised with texture and taste! Will make again!

This is a great variation on sloppy joe--a big hit for my family. I only put in about half the taco seasoning, mostly because of my daughter who isn't a fan of it generally. If I was making it just for my husband and me, though, I would put in the whole package. Thanks for this super easy and tasty dish!

I was looking for a different way to use some canned baked beans.  This dish fit the bill perfectly!  My 3 school-age girls really liked as well. A few slight changes: I used 1 lb ground pork (what I had & cheaper) and 1 lb gr beef.  Also used 28oz can of Busch's reg baked beans.  Added 1 medium chopped onion while browning the meat.  I had very little drippings, so I just left them in.

I consider this more of a variation on a sloppy joe than a true "burger", but still super easy and delicious.

I loved the bean/beef combo for a healthier, cheaper meal, but next time I think I'll flavor them like traditional sloppy joes, instead of taco. Thanks for the new sandwich idea!!

We just tried this one again using 1 pound of ground turkey, instead of the 2 pounds of ground beef.  Super Good, Super EASY!  Even our kids were impressed.
