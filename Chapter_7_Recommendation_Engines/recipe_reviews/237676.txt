I have made this 3 times now and each time it has turned out great.  The 1st time was as written, the 2nd time was with a chunk of pork butt roast, and tonight I used 7 boneless skinless chicken thighs, chicken bullion, 1 can stewed tomatoes, 1 can crushed tomato, and 1 cup dried black beans.  Cooked this in crock pot on high for 7 hours. I was trying to make something like a gumbo with what I had on hand and by just dumping everything into pot and walking away.  The experiment turned out very well but next time I would add shrimp, add more beans but soak overnight or at least boil 20-30 minutes prior to adding to pot.  The point I am trying to make is that this recipe is very versatile and many other things can be substituted for ham bone (I usually don't have one on hand), and it will still turn out great.  Oh,and use whole can of coconut milk.  Thanks for the great base recipe and I never would have thought to add the coconut milk but it really makes this dish!  Next time I will use some venison or caribou.

This recipe was surprisingly good! My family gobbled it up. I loved the step of heating up the herbs and spices beforehand to make them aromatic. The only changes I made were 1) because I did not have coconut milk, I used an extra cup of water and tablespoon of coconut oil for flavor. 2) Being a gumbo addict, I had to add a tablespoon of Gumbo File. Otherwise I kept true to the recipe and it was delicious!

This was amazing flavorI used a ham bone from a hickory spiral ham . I also added frozen okra and  the shrimp at the end of cooking. To thicken I added one cup of leftover rice. 
I think the spices would make an amazing base for fried rice.

I enjoyed this- used Rotel rather than tomatoes. I had a heavy hand with the chili powder as well.

I will make again, very tasty and easy.  I added cooked, leftover rice with the coconut milk (whole can, why not?), only change.  I did use popcorn shrimp, because I had them.  They worked great, but I do think small to medium size would be better, not so sure about jumbo size though.  Great recipe, thanks!

I added 2 chicken Adouille sausage cut into 1/2 inch rounds and 2 cups sliced Okra and upped the Cayenne a bit.  It is a keeper.

We loved it over rice. I did add a package of Andouille sausage.  The flavor was deep and smokey.
