My husband is allergic to beef and pork products. That means that finding new things to do with chicken is always a plus. While searching for something other than the same ole same ole, I happened across this recipe and decided to give it a whirl. 

Overall, this recipe is wonderful. It not only has a good flavor but it also ends up being a very beautiful dish to look at. In fact, my husband and I almost didn't eat it because it was too pretty.

If you are accustomed to spices in your food, I would recommend adding a healthy dose to this recipe. While the flavor of the chicken and peppers is tasty, for those of us that love spicy food - it needs a little something more. 

I used an orange pepper instead of yellow and I served it over a bed of no-yolk wide egg noodles with a splash of butter and salt. It was delicious! I'll definitely be making this one again - with LOTS of spices.

I was very very dissapointed with this recipe.  I enountered two problems with this recipe.  The first problem I encountered was that this recipe did not provide adequate time to fully cook the chicken.  Simply browning the chicken leaves it raw.  The second problem is that fully cooking the chicken will cause the breading to burn.  My solution was to follow the recipe as written, but then add all the ingredients together and simmer them on low heat covered for 5 minutes.  This allowed the chicken to cook throughly.  The flavour was alright, but it did not taste good the next day and since I live alone I like being able to enjoy the leftovers.

My husband and I liked this one--low cal and full of flavor.  I used seasoned bread crumbs in place of the crackers, so I should've used seasoned salt on the chicken breasts.

Thought this was a wonderful recipe. My son is on a low carb diet for football training and I just put a bit of the saltines on his. Added a bit more chicken broth and flour (for 4) and was just great! Also added a bit of tobasco sauce when cooking the peppers. Didn't need anything else but I might serve a green salad with it next time. Absolutely tasty!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I adjusted the recipe to be  a little less healthy. :) I used an egg instead of the egg substitute and a lot of extra butter when cooking. I also substituted Italian bread crumbs for the saltine crackers and Italian seasoning.

This is a tasty chicken dish that is great for a family meal, but I wouldn't serve it to company.  It's quick and easy to prepare, but does require some tweaking.  I used 2 chicken breasts but doubled all the other ingredients.  I didn't have saltines so used bread crumbs mixed with a heaping teaspoon each of basil and oregano, 1/2 teaspoon each of seasoned salt and garlic powder.  I also added 1/2 cup dry white wine to the sauce.  I had to add more butter when browning the chicken.  I'll definitely make this again as we enjoyed it.

I was very disappointed at this recipe.  My whole family found it bland and uninteresting.  I too found that the crumb coating started to burn before the chicken was done, and I ended up having to cut my chicken into smaller pieces in order to cook it adequately without further burning.  Adding more broth helped make more sauce, which helped a bit. I don't plan to make it again.

This is really good, but only if you actually use about 3 or 4 tablespoons of butter.  1 1/2 tbl does not do the job.

Fairly bland when made as is. The cracker crust started burning long before the chicken was fully cooked. We had to microwave it for a few minutes to get the center cooked. With a substantial amount of additional spice or flavor this could be a decent dish. We thought pineapple and soy for more of an asian flavor or lots of thyme for a more country flavor.

While this is very good, it does need some tweaking for next time. Even though the chicken is covered in saltines, it still needs more salt, as do the veggies. I cooked the veggies in only 1/2 T. butter. I added the rest to cook the chicken, not just brown it. The butter wasn't really enough, but I was using a non-stick pan, so it was fine. Next time, I will double the chicken broth and flour since it really wasn't enough to even moisten the pasta I topped it with. Then it might not qualify for a healthy MyPlate recipe, but it will taste better :)

I made just a couple of changes to this recipe...I used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers and real eggs instead of egg substitute. Plus I used mostly green peppers since it was all I had on hand, and I omitted onion. (Boyfriend hates onions.)
Maybe it was the missing onion, but I didn't think this was that great. The pepper flavor was overwhelming to me, barely even tasted the chicken at all, and the broth/flour sauce stuff that it was sauteed in just didn't taste all that good. i made it as written except for the subtle changes so I'm not sure what was missing...maybe I just don't like bell peppers enough to warrant the excess of flavor in the dish. It wasn't awful just not great.

The dish turned out ok, with a few changes.  It doesn't say to season the veggies, and I forgot but they tasted yummy w/o.  I used bread crumbs mixed w/ italian herbs and Vegeta seasoning.  I just added a bit of sauce on top of the peppers.  The sauce needs some more seasoning this way though.  I served it with quinoa.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I too used seasoned bread crumbs (because that is what I had), and I added more seasoning to both the bread crumbs and the gravy.  I also had to add extra butter, but overall we thought it was great and I will make it again! Thanks Shirl!

This came out very tasty, but I did make some changes, as per some of the reviewer suggestions. I didn't have saltines, so I used Italian breadcrumbs and a real egg for the chicken. I took other reveiwers advice and cut the chicken into smaller pieces. They cooked nicely and didnt overbrown. I also love spicier food, so i added half a jalapeño to the pepper blend. While making the gravy, I added some thyme, rosemary, Greek seasoning and lots of black pepper to spice it up. I served the pepper gravy over mashed potatoes with the chicken set on top with a little parsley for garnish. Very tasty!

Good recipe, but needs spicing up.  Definitely pound the chicken breasts or finish off in the microwave after browning, like I did and it turned out fine.  I also used Panko breadcrumbs with lots of Italian seasoning, garlic salt and pepper which helped.  I also recommend doubling the butter and the chicken broth/flour mixture.

I have made this a few times. Followed the recipe first time.  Loved it. However, it's just easier to substitute saltines with Italian bread crumbs (Panko).  I had to use more butter. I also sliced the breasts in half, instead of flattening them.. I agree the coating gets dark when sauted in pan, but doesn't taste burnt.   The sauce needs to be doubled.   Serve over rice, noodles, or mashed potatoes.

This was pretty good but I made a bunch of changes. Just looking at the recipe I could see it needed way more seasoning! I read through the reviews and most people agreed that it needed more, too. I only used red, yellow and orange peppers because of the tendency of green peppers to over-power a dish. The more subtle pepper flavor will appeal to those who don't care for green peppers. Also, to address the issue of the chicken not cooking long enough, I made this dish with chicken breast tenderloins which worked perfectly! I served it over mashed potaoes and the hubby loved it! Here's how I made it-
Three Pepper Chicken
Ingredients
¾ cup plain bread crumbs
 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
½ tsp. Garlic powder
 ½ tsp. Seasoned salt
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup butter
1 pound chicken breast tenderloins
1 egg, lightly beaten 
1 cup julienned red bell pepper
1 cup julienned yellow bell pepper
1 cup julienned orange bell pepper
1 small onion, cut in half and then thinly sliced.
1 tsp minced garlic
2 ½ cups chicken broth
5 TBSP. all-purpose flour
salt and pepper
Seasoned salt
Directions
1. In a shallow dish or bowl, beat egg. In a separate dish, combine bread crumbs, seasonings and Parmesan cheese.  Dip each chicken tenderloin in the egg, then coat well with crumb mixture. Set aside.
2. In a large skillet heat butter over medium heat. Add bell peppers, onion, mushrooms and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender. Remove pepper mixture from skillet leaving butt

Made with diced peppers and onions. Used regular Italian bread crumbs. Also added some sriracha powder to chicken and sriracha sauce to veggies. Otherwise cooked as directed. We love this!

very good over the top of mashed potatoes.  All my guys liked it, and it was very easy to make.
