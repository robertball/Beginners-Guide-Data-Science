This dish was AWESOME! It seriously tasted like something from Olive Garden. The only thing I did different was that I added a small handful of mozzerella cheese to the sauce and I didnt use any of the pasta water. I also sauted some shrimp in butter and a clove of minced garlic and it turned out perfect! I will be making this one again and again!

WOW!  My family really loved this. I needed this for 6 and it converted very easily.  I wanted to add chicken so I just cut chicken breasts into bite size pieces seasoned with salt and peper and cooked them with the onions and garlic. I also had some really fresh tomatoes so I chopped them into small pieces and added them to the top of the dish after it was on the plate.  This made a wonderful addition.  I will be making this a lot.

Fantastic!!! After reading everyone's issues with thickness, and especially since I am a carbonara expert (Thanks Dad!), the best way to get desired thickness is a low flame for 20-30 minutes, constant stirring, and if necessary, 2 tbsp of cornstarch and 2 tbsp of cold water mixture. Other than the usual additions of shrimp, chicken or veggies, I wouldn't have changed a thing!!

Easy, quick, and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made it for my boyfriend, served with a garlic chicken breast.  He still can't stop raving about it.

I have made this so many times, my husband and I love it! I've done it several ways, but here's my favorite.  I add a ton of chopped mushrooms with the onion ( I put mushrooms in everything) I also add 2 TBSP of flour to the butter mixture to thicken it a little. I use Fat Free Half and Half (that's why it needs thickened a little).  Much healthier and I don't miss the cream! Also put in a pinch of nutmeg and  1/2 cup of shredded mozzerella.  Delicious!!

This recipe is so quick and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and added a pound of shrimp.  AWESOME!!!  It's now the household favorite.  Side note: the sauce was a little runny so I added about a cup of mozzarella cheese.  PERFECT!

Made the recipe as is except for some minor changes.  I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream and added about 1 T flour to the sauce before adding the cream to make a thicker sauce.  Neither of these changes changed the integrity of the recipe.  I think this is a good quick lunch especially during a pasta craving but nothing particularly special.  It does taste like some box mixes I have tried.  I may make it again but will probably tweak it extensively.

This recipe is amazing! I even converted the recipe to feed 10 & it was just as delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, adding shrimp at the very end of cooking the sauce. Definately a family favorite!

Made the recipe exactly as stated and my son & I both found it lacking in flavor, rather bland.  Disappointing since I made a special trip to the store for heavy cream, a sweet onion, and fresh basil.

This was wonderful! Like other reviewers, I served this dish with some simple garlic chicken, which I quickly sauteed separately, and combined them at the end. Didn't use any pasta water; the consistency was perfect as it was. My fiancee didn't enjoy this meal, but that's because she doesn't like cream sauce. I'll make it again next time she's not around :)

I had about 2 tbs of pesto I needed to use so I incorporated it along with some freshly chopped basil.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 and just let it cook over a low flame until the right consistency.  There is no way I felt as if I was stuck eating leftovers, this was restaurant quality!

The recipe turned out great, I added one more clove of garlic and some white wine to the sauce, basically I made enough for 2 people so I bumped up all the ingredients just a tad and added a leftover cooked chicken breast.  I would make this again, Thanks for the recipe, SharFras

This was awesome!!! This is the first time I have ever been moved to actually write a review and I have been using this site for years! BTW I did not have fresh basil and used dried; I also added a little parsley as well. I upped the servings to 4 but only used 1 carton of heavy cream (2 cups) and the consistency was still perfect.

This was quite good.  I was looking for a substitute for the packaged angel hair pasta dishes.  My toddler, who usually only eats pasta with cheese or red sauce, ate quite a bit.  It wasn't the most flavorful and I think it uses a bit too much butter.  We added chicken with it to fill out the meal more.  Will definitely make this again.

It was good. If I did it again though I would use regular onion instead of sweet onion, I didn't like the sweetness it imparted to the sauce. I used fat free half n half to cut calories (and to use it up before it went bad) so mine was very thin. I imagine I could've thickened it with cornstarch but it was fine like it was, just added more cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful!  A perfect sauce.  I did make a few revisions - I used 1/2 cup of whipping cream and 1/2 cup of milk - I don't like pasta that is too rich...I also added some chopped mushrooms, fresh diced tomatoes as a topping and I added a pinch of nutmeg to the sauce.  The taste was wonderful and my husband was licking the plate!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This is decadant.  I made 2 changes - I used 1 Tablespoon of butter instead of 2 and while cooking the onion and garlic I sauted 4 prawns.  It was fast to prepare and soooo good.

This is one of those recipes where you can't help but think, why didn't I try to do something like this before.  Excellent flavor.  I don't use cream often so I actually used 2% milk as a substitute, and it still turned out great.  I love when I can find a recipe that both hubby and I agree on the first time tried.

Fantastic!  I replaced clove of minced garlic with just garlic salt and it was still delicious!  Next time I'm gonna buy garlic clove and see if it can get even better.

I have made this a few times now. the first time I stuck to the recipe.  have tryed to use diffrent milk products to cut back on fat never as smooth and creamy as with whole cream. i cut back on the onion, love the basil taste better. this is my favorite dish when im spoiling my self and its easy good as olive garden. i saute chicken and add to sauce and love to add mushrooms.

I thought this was good but not spectacular.  It was a little bland to me and tasted a little too much of parmesan.  If I make this again I will whisk in an egg yolk like I do for Alfredo, add some tarragon, and more butter for sure.  I'll saute some mushrooms in the butter with the onions first, before adding the garlic.  It's a decent recipe but needs tweaking to suit me.  My boyfriend liked it just fine so I gave it 4 stars.

The taste is AMAZING! I use this sauce on it's own with pasta and also in my 'white veggie' lasagna! Everyone raves!! The reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it takes forever to thicken. It's weird because the recipe says to even reserve some pasta water in case the sauce is too thick and you want to thin it out. It makes me think.... am I using the right kind of cheese? It says grated parm cheese- that's what I use, the grated stuff. I'm not supposed to be using shredded parm, correct?! Hummmm....... It's great though!! :)

Fantastic!  I added in mushrooms & spinach in the sauce.  I also served a blackened salmon filet on top.  The pasta is delicious on its own I just added the fish for extra protien.  The key to this delicious pasta is to season The garlic and onion mixture right before you add in the whipping cream.  I am very very pleased with the results.  For color to the plate I added a few dice tomatoes on top to garnish. ***angel hair pasta cooks really fast so watch it carefully... you might want to cook it once your sauce is almost done.  I omitted the part that said use pasta water in the sauce.  Its unnecessary

Absolutely delicious & so simple to make! I actually switched it a little - instead of basil I made it with fresh parsley. & used Mafalda pasta tossed in some fresh green beans & cauliflower to add some veggies to the mix. It's incredible.

I have not yet tried this home made recipe but I will soon and I'm a big fan of past Alfredo angle hair dishes but like I said I have not tried this yet but I will soon as I can.

used fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  Came out very runny even though cooked it awhile.  Did thicken up as cooled.  Worth trying again- company really liked it.

Excellent recipe...I love Italian food and being a vegetarian this is one of the few recipes which is meatless but very good. I followed the original reicpe but added a lot of black pepper and it turned out just perfect.

No one in my family liked this except for my 3 year old son, who 100% cleaned his plate, which is highly unusual.  My husband kept complaining it tasted too much like scampi, which he doesn't really like.  I just didn't really like the taste too much.  Sorry, won't be making this one again.

This was really good and it tasted just like the pasta you'd order at restaurants. But it tasted like it was missing something...next time I'll add shrimp.

This was restaurant-quality! I served it with garlic chicken, but it would also be great with shrimp.  So yummy!
