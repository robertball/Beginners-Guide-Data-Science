This cake was okay...  I think next time, I will double the amount of chocolate, 1 ounce was not enough.  The icing was very very good.  I left out the raw egg yolk and used 4 tbls of milk instead, to guard against salmonella infection.

Pretty good cake and with a nice presentation. I did not do the shapes of bats/cats nor the 1 sq of choc. Instead while making the frosting, I used 1 orange (dry) Kool-aid packet IPO of the zests.  I spread the frosting between the layers and on top, giving the appearance that the orange frosting was "oozing" down the sides of the cake.  Then, I purchased those rock hard, edible candies in the shapes of bats, moons, cats, etc..and randomly stuck them to the cake.  Nice look, nice taste.
