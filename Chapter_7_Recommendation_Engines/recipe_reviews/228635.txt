I rinsed/drained my black beans and corn before I used them in this recipe. I did add some diced onion and fresh minced garlic, I really think that helped to add a little more flavor. This was a nice basic black bean salsa. We ate it but it's one of those recipes that I'm not real sure I'd make again.

I love recipes like this that come together in no time and use pantry staples.  I used frozen corn, omitted lemon pepper, and subbed parsley for cilantro per personal preference.  I can definately see this becoming my go to black bean salsa.  I also prefer that it makes a smaller amount than the other black bean salsa recipes I've made before.  THANKS for the recipe, All4Tricia!

I used to get this off of the Kroger canned black beans.  Kroger changed the label and dropped the recipe. Happy someone posted it.  It's easy and delicious.  For the record, I like to use red onion, but green is fine as well.

Easy and fast! Per our taste, I use 3 cans of Rotel tomatoes w chilies. No cumin, sometimes fresh squeezed lime juice. I usually make enough to last for a couple days to eat on. I love this as a staple in the fridge during the summer!

I had to make changes due to not having the exact ingredients also we don't like cilantro. I also had to leave out the corn as some don't like that. I added some chopped onion n 2 garlic cloves, chopped. I used a 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes, drained all juice n chopped  tomatoes. I added about 1/4 chunk of avocado, chopped n a few shakes of chili powder. Its delicious! Thanks

Just made waiting to chill, I added a half teaspoon of red chili flakes and a tablespoon of Sriracha for a little kick.

It's very easy to make but the recipe seems to be missing something
