This turned out pretty good. I do think it could have used more. Mushrooms, olives, or possibly artichoke come to mind. The recipe title is also deceiving. There is nothing grilled about this recipe. With all of that being said, I am still giving this 4 stars. It was fast and simple  and overall a good recipe. I topped mine with crushed red pepper flakes and basil and that was a nice touch.
