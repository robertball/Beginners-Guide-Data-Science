This is a nice recipe for flat iron steak.  I did, however, cut back on the amount of liquids in the sauce (to 1/2 the stated amounts) and skipped the flour entirely.  I prefer my sauces without flour and just cooked the sauce down to the proper consistency.  I also added a splash of dry sherry as we really like that flavor in our mushroom sauces.  We did the steak on the grill (along with another steak we had done asian style) and it turned out fantastic.

Made this recipe as listed and my family really liked it.  The sauce is quite yummy and certainly worth making again.  The recipe lists ingredients of heavy whipping cream and chives, but nowhere in the instructions did it state how and where to use these items as of 25 March.   I'm not the savviest in the kitchen, so I added the heavy whipping cream to the sauce shortly after adding the butter/flour mixture and simmered and stirred for about 5 minutes.   This seemed to work well.  The sauce thickened and the flavor increased.   We all had seconds!

Best recipe ever, if you really want to enhance the flavor, season the steak with chipotle chili powder, garlic powder, celery salt, onion powder, kosher salt, pepper, and rubbed sage. This adds an extra kick to the entire dish.  I season heavily before searing so the flavors are incorporated into the sauce. This is our favorite meal.

this recipe is absolutely fantastic! I've made it three times in two months and it was a huge hit at a dinner party. Some changes that I made include doubling the mushrooms (to 1 lb.), adding chopped onions to the sauce and using venison instead of beef since we've got a whole freezer full. you can't go wrong with this wonderful review. thanks for sharing!

This was my two favorite things - easy and delicious. I made a couple changes though because I only used what I had on hand.  First, I used deer tenderloin instead of beef  and second, I used port wine instead of burgundy because, again, it's what I had. I also substituted the onion powder with a whole onion because I like the texture it adds to the sauce; I just sauteed them with the mushrooms.   What a great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing this with us. It has just become a family favorite.

Tried this recipe tonight. I substituted the cremini mushrooms with portobello's because that's what I had on hand.  Anyway, the cremini is a baby portobello mushroom I have learned. Also, I used Merlot instead of burgundy. This is a really excellent recipe. Normally I don't like flat iron steaks, but this put a whole new light on it.

Loved this recipe!  Easy to make, and the results are outstanding!  I cooked my steaks about 3-4 minutes per side in my cast iron skillet, and later transferred it to my oven.  Very tender & delish steaks!

Very tasty, stuck to the recipe and found the sauce a little too loose, next time I will increase the flour amount to thicken it more. Cook time on the steak was on point and the whole thing tasted great.

My whole family loved this!  I used a combination of baby bellas and white mushrooms (probably more like a pound) and it came out great.

First time to make flat iron steak. Wow!!!! This was really good.
Hubby put it as number one. Can't wait to make again. Had to sub red wine blend for the burgundy. Also had to substitute bone broth for the beef broth can't wait to make as written. Still Fabulous!!! Thanks!??

This dish was excellent! I substituted the the brandy wine with my kids Honest juice and added a little lemon for a more acidic taste.  The meat ended up rare (just how we like it) and we added fresh dill on top instead of chives. It was absolutely delicious and my family devoured it!

Delicious, the mushroom sauce was superb and the meat so tender.  The roasted potatoes were excellent with it.  A great company dish.
