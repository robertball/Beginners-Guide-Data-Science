I loved this frosting its pretty good but I only give it 4 satrs because The 6 cups of confectioners sugar are way of, I dont know how 6 cups could be the recipe I only used 2 cups and it came out perfect and quite sweet already! You can also add food coloring to eat anda decorate your cakes!

it was just okay. I had to add A LOT of lemon juice to give it any flavor besides confectioner's sugar.

Loved it!  I made the recipe as it except I left out the lemon peel and orange peel. I used Earth Balance butter since my son is allergic to dairy.  I added one tablespoon more of the orange juice and lemon juice to get it at the consistency that I wanted.  Colored and frosted it on a gingerbread cake for Christmas.  Looks great!  I will be using this one again.
