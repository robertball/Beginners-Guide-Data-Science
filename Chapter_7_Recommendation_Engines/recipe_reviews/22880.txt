I would have given this recipe 5 stars except the cookies baked up puffier than you would expect for a roll-out sugar cookie, and so the shapes were distorted. This makes a wonderfully flavorful sugar cookie similar to those found in restaurants and stores, it is just not ideal for rolling and cutting out shapes, it is better for just round molded cookies. The dough was very easy to work with and the flavor of these cookies is...for lack of a better word...wonderful! It is exactly the flavor I was looking for in a sugar cookie, so I will most likely "tweak" this recipe and use it again many times!

I really liked this recipe.  But I did make a few changes: I replaced the lemon extract with almond essence, and I added a dash of nutmeg. 
The consistency was just right.  The cookies do puff up more than I'd expected, but using a more simple shape...like a heart or a flower...works fine.

I have tried many cookie jar recipes.  This one is great!  I always try the recipe before I give it to friends.  Made these cookies with my 3 and 4 year old. It looks crumbly after you mix it, but I just gathered up the whole dough, wrapped it in a piece of plastic wrap, refrigerated it, and then instead of rolling it out we just made 1 inch balls and pressed them into Christmas sprinkles.  They spread a lot, but they made a nice chewy sugar cookie.  Very easy recipe. Will make these again and again.

These are the best sugar cookies I've ever had...melt in your mouth crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle.  Oh yum!  

I didn't have lemon extract so I used 1/4 tsp. additional vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. orange extract and it was delicious.

These cookies were awful! I couldn't even roll it out, they were crumbly and just impossible. Unless, we did something wrong which I doubt since we followed the instructions, I am never making them again.

The taste is very good and I may make this again.  For me it is quite sweet and we did not add frosting or any decoration.  If I make this again, I will try it with less sugar.  However, I don't think I'll use it for cut-outs (which is what I was looking for) because it really expands during cooking and the cut-outs will lose their shapes.

This was an amazing recipe! I did use almond extract not lemon and folks loved the cookies. Dough does crumble but if you let the dough sit over night in the refrigerator and then make medium sized balls until dough is smooth and not crumbling, and then roll out, it works well to cut out shapes. I had a party and the cookies were a huge success.

This recipe is tasty, but misleading. So, five stars for taste, minus two for the wrong label! The dough is much too soft to easily roll and cut, and it looses shape in the oven.

However, that rising quality means that these are light, crisp, just soft enough, and delicious.  I changed the recipe just a touch for fall cookies.  Instead of lemon oil, I added two tablespoons of maple syrup (with a touch of flour to balance the liquid), and I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, a half a teaspoon of ginger, and a pinch of nutmeg.  They were lovely and also nice with tea.

Edible and workable, but not fantastic. They were very puffy and distorted,  but worked for simple hearts.  An ok flavor, but I will keep looking.

These were really excellent cookies!  I didn't have lemon extract, but it wasn't a problem to just leave it out.  Nutmeg would probably be a nice touch.  I will try that next time.  Also I didn't have the puffiness issue some reviewers talked about.  My cutouts came out just fine.  As always I'm using my trusty toaster oven.  750 watts for 7 minutes if anyone else is in this situation!  On top I used cinnamon sugar on some and colored sugar on others.  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading all of the reviews, I decided to decrease the baking powder and baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon each. My cookies came out perfect, they puffed up just a little bit and held their shape. I used this recipe to make christmas cookies. Loved it!

The cookie dough was extremely sticky, even after mass attempts to decrease stickiness by adding more flour, it was still sticky. I ended up using half a teaspoon baking powder and baking soda. I didn't use cookie cutters, instead I just rolled them sphere-like. Although I made the balls miniature, The cookies took around 15 minutes to bake a batch. The overall result was delicious, I will definately use this recipe again!

I have no idea how these taste, but I will advise against using this as suggested, as a jarred gift. Although it says they'll fit in a quart jar, they don't even come close.  I have a whole cup of flour that needs to go in, and there's nowhere to put it at all.  I'm displeased, as it means I'll either have to bake them myself or throw away all the ingredients. Very frustrating!

I will admit that i made this strictly for cuttin cookies with my son and OH boy what a mess! This recipe is VERY wet and sticky...I added A LOT more flour to make the dough manageable, and now they taste like...well...flour! Perhaps the would have tasted great with the original recipe but this recipe certainly iS NOT for cookie cutting! BOOOO!

My family and I absolutly LOVED these cookies.  I followed the instructions step by step and they turned out perfect!  My husband said "these are so good they taste like they came straight from a bakery!"  These are perfect for bake sales, potlucks, a good dessert to take to a friend/family dinner.  Perfect for every occasion.  I will use this recipe for years to come!

These came out perfect. I only eliminated the lemon juice because my daughter said she had sugar cookies with lemon in it before and didn't like it.

I had to add about a c. of flour to form dough for cutouts. Made frosting to go with it and tasted very good. My family is pigging out on them and I plan to make them again soon. Thank you very much for sharing! The taste definitely deserves 10 stars!

I REALLY needed to make this recipe work for cut out sugar cookies. It was extremely puffy and also VERY sticky. To fix that problem I made a second batch with no additional baking powder or baking soda and only 1 egg and added it to the first batch. That worked wonders! You will still need to use lots of flour when rolling them but you will be able to get them cut out and onto the cookie sheet and they should still look like what you want them too. If making the same amount again I would just half the baking powder, soda and only use 1 egg.

I loved these cookies! Although I didn't have lemon extract and vanilla, I improvised.  Instead of vanilla I used water and instead of lemon extract I used lime juice. My family loved it!

I had to try these before giving them as gifts and I am so glad I did! They are GREAT. This is my new sugar cookie recipe. I have been looking for one for years (always using a new one because I couldn't find one I really liked). Not as soft as I was hoping but my daughters weren't exactly rolling the dough even either :) You have to try this with the sugar cookie frosting recipe on this site.

These need to be rolled thinner if you want them to hold shape but thicker make wonderful chewy sugar cookies. Love them!

They taste great BUT there was no way I could roll the dough to use my cookie cutters for Christmas shapes. My dough was very dry. I am not sure if it was b/c I did not melt the butter enough; although the recipe said to soften not melt the butter. We ended up just rolling them into balls, which was fine, but was not the intent.

These were super yummy. I also had a problem with them being way too crumbly so I added another egg. It seemed to solve the problem. I rolled my cookies out quite thin and got a nice crisp sugar cookie. Oh and it maintained the star shape (from my cookie cutter) very well.

I compared may sugar cookies recipes and I decide to make this one.  It was a hit at the baby shower and everyone asked for the recipe.

Not bad at all.  I would have liked them to have a little more of the "melt-in-your-mouth" goodness that I've tasted in some sugar cookies.  They went over well with the company but I just don't think they have the WOW factor of a 5-star recipe.  Great for a basic sugar cookie, though.

Not my favorite for roll-outs.  They're fine for drop, but need less butter or more flour for a real roll-out cookie.  Tasted great though!

This is exactly the taste I was looking for in a sugar cookie!  I didn't have time to roll the cookies out and use cookie cutters, so I used a cookie scooper and dropped them onto a cookie sheet (didn't flatten them down).  They turned out beautifully!  I'm going to frost them with the Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies recipe on this website, which is also very good!

If your looking to make cut-out cookies this is definitely not the recipe for you ...very sticky even when rolled out and the longer you leave the dough on the counter while cutting out the worse it is...didn't love it..sorry.

These are lovely. First time I've ever made sugar cookies actually. I didn't have lemon extract, so I just used additional vanilla extract. They still turned out great, but I imagine they are even more spectacular with a lemon or almond extract. I didn't use cookies cutters, just used a teaspoon, rounded them a bit, dipped them in sugar crystals and flattened them just a bit with the back of the spoon. I have an apartment sized oven and it heats up very quickly, so I had to bake these at 350 degrees for 8 minutes instead of 10-12 in order to achieve the crispy outside, chewy inside texture. Great recipe, thanks!

Girlfriend made this recipe as a year for gifts and it is a well flavored recipe. The dough is a wet dough that is hard to cut so keep that in mind. 

If bottling this make sure to fluff the flour before measuring, packed flour will result in too much to put in the jars.

A canning funnel will be your lifesaver as well.

So good!  They were gone in a day! Skipped the jar and frosted with a recipe I also found on this site...butter cream frosting I. Just used top of glass to cut out circles. Easy and delicious!

This is a very good recipe.  The flavor is 5 stars!  They definately do not hold their shape though which makes it a 3 star recipe.  I settled on a final review of 4 stars.  My cookies turned out very flat, but tasted great regardless.

I followed the directions and found that the ingredients do not fit in the jar.  A quart jar holds 4 cups,  this recipe has over 4 cups of ingredients just with flour and sugar.
