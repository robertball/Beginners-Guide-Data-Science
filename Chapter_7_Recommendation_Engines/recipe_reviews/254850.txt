8.12.16   Had some cornflakes heading toward the bottom of the box and an opened bag of dark-chocolate chocolate chips.  This recipe is ridiculously easy to make and they do taste yummy.  Not sure this is one for little kids.  I chilled them thoroughly, but that delicious chocolate melts pretty quickly...did a lot of finger licking after I sampled a couple.  The recipe says to refrigerate until cool, but I’d recommend keeping them in the fridge.  If I make again, I’ll probably add a bit more peanut butter (personal taste), but these definitely will be gone soon.  Thanks for sharing linda!

I will preface this review by stating that I've had to cut out dairy and soy for my daughter, who is still breastfeeding.  With that being said, these are one of the BEST dairy/soy free sweet treats that I have made in months.  To comply with my dietary restrictions, I used Enjoy Life chocolate chips and natural peanut butter.  I stuck to one cup of the chocolate chips, but did large, heaping tablespoons on the peanut butter.  I also substituted the Cornflakes for Rice Krispies.  (Rice Krispies are "safe" for me, plus I had them on hand.)  Very satisfying for a sweet craving!

This recipe was very easy to make. The peanut butter was barely noticeable so I will up the amount I use next time. The kiddos I served these to had no complaints.

I was looking for a sweet treat but did not have too much time. I found this recipe and it sounded perfect. While I was making them, I did not think they would turn out to be good. It got a bit messy.  I did use a little more peanut butter than called for ( i love PB).  I threw them on the cookie sheet and put them in the freezer. 25 min later they were ready and I took my first bite and was happily surprised they were so good. Tasted like a Reeses PB Cup but crunchy. I love crunchy food. So easy to make and I had all the ingredients already! Will definitely make again.
