This was a big winner with everyone.  I had 3 pounds of mussels.  We subbed beer for the wine, used a tablespoon of crushed red pepper (we like 'em hot!) and since we were having clams as well we wanted this to be a red sauce.  I added a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes  and doubled the butter.  I let the sauce cook a bit to thicken and then added the mussels.  So good!  Loved the sauce over some linguine.  Will be making this again!

I changed this one just a bit and it turned out awesome. Used beer instead of wine and added some heavy cream. It was a hit at our last dinner party.

Simply superb!  I decreased the amount of white wine (1.5 cups) and added a large splash of heavy cream (about 1 Tbsp).  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  As someone who really loves mussels and who has made them many times in a variety of ways... I can say that this is my new favorite recipe for them.  I made 'em especially for my elderly father, who really enjoyed dipping his crusty bread into the amazing sauce.  Many thanks to Chef John for yet another splendid recipe!

This is an excellent base recipe - so many things that you can do to tweak!

For the second attempt, I made some adjustments (in order of addition to the pot:

More butter (not much - though more butter is always best),
More garlic,
about 2 medium chopped leeks (they were in the fridge getting sad from the farmer's market 3 weeks ago),
a huge tomato roughly chopped (again, from the farmer's market last week. Poor dear was getting squishy - oh well, cut  off the weird stuff and use the rest! I tasted first, it was divine),
added 1/2 pound of fresh shrimp with shells still on - backs cut with scissors to make for easy peeling later but not de-veined,
3/4 of a medium summer squash- diced into 1/2 in cubes (this might've been too small, oh well),
about 1/2 of the wine replaced with distilled water,
I didn't have parsley but I had a ton of sorrel (again, starting to get sad. We tend to play favorites with vegetables, running out of kale but never eating the other greens!) so I took about 3/4 of a big bundle and roughly sliced across to make ribbons. Dropped some in at the end - got a bit brown and strange looking but added a wonderful toothy brightness to vegetable bites that lemon couldn't capture alone.

The result? Fantastic! A medley of bright vegetables in a light, mildly tomato sauce. I meant to add cream but forgot! It was still delectable. Must be served with a big bowl for shells (both mussel and shrimp). What to do with the shells? Bury them in the yard, I suppose!

This was NOT good.  If I were to make thing again I would likely double the butter, and split the wine with some type of stock.  Two cups of wine is terrible.  I used good, dry white and even added a leek that I had in the fridge but there was no flavor besides the wine.  Seafood like this shouldn't need salt and this did.

This recipe is divine! I felt like I was eating this at a "Legal Seafood" restaurant in Boston. Anyone that loves seafood, has traveled some and has experienced a "Legal Seafood" restaurant in Boston knows what I'm saying. I only made half of this recipe. I live in Colorado at an elevation of 6,800 feet and it only took 2 minutes for the mussels to open, I expected that it would take much longer than that yet the mussels were done perfectly. Being that I only made half of the original recipe amounts, I found that 1 cup of a nice white wine was too much. I suggest that anyone that makes this entree as written for 2 servings to only use 1 cup of wine instead of the 2 cups that is called for.

I LOVE this recipe and made many times. What I have learned is that having the parsley doesn't make or break this dish. What does make this dish is the lemon zest and wine, which needs to be a chardonnay with a good oak finish. I tried with a  Pinot Grigio and it was too fizzy.  And go big with the butter using a stick. It's not like you eat all of it as much is left in the juice you discard. And take time with the letting the ingredients really saute and blend together the medley of flavors before adding the mussels.  And these heat up really well as left overs with the broth in a saucepan the next day.  I found the best economical wine to use is Kirkland's Chardonnay. Like they say, if you won't drink it, don't cook with it.  Good luck!

This recipe was great! It made me look like a master cook without much experience. It looked beautiful, but I did have a hard time getting all the mussels to open (may have been the quality of the mussels). I used my boyfriend and my favorite wine, which is a sweet white and what we had on hand, I will not do that again! it was way too sweet and fruity. dry white or beer next time, but I will definitely try it again!

This is THE basic recipe for mussels that we like.  However, if you want to print it, don't use allrecipes print option - you will get something with 3 point type.  Have to copy and paste into Word or printscreen.

omg that sauce i thought i was heaven. however i did change a couple of things 1. i only used a cup of white wine cause I kinda drank to much and i only had a cup left and 2. I added a NZ smoked ghost pepper cause I like chili. My 6 year old daughter who normally refuses to eat mussels loved these. Defo on my house hold cooking list.

I doubled the butter, used 2/3 bottle of Pino Grigio, eyeballed the red pepper flakes (we like it a bit hotter than many) & subbed cilantro for the parsley.   It was a big hit.  Shared the recipe and will make it again.

I enjoyed it the first time I made it - it’s a perfectly adequate recipe . That said, the second and subsequent times I’ve made it since then,  I now add a little more butter, and cut back the amount of white wine by 1/2 C. I then put back that 1/2 C with seafood broth instead, and I also use equal amounts of vermouth AND white wine as well with that substitution. Adds a LOT of flavour to it. 

Still and all, this is a terrific place to start if you’ve never made this type of recipe before!

Awesome! We were still hungry and used the sauce to cook some large shrimp.  Easy and leaves a tasty sauce.

I added mushroom and onion to the broth to add a little bit more flavor as well as linguini.  I cooked the linguini until it was almost cooked, strained it, and add it to the broth to continue cooking.  After the mussels were open I took them out and added the pasta to the broth.  Then, I took most of the mussels out of the shells and added it to the pasta and broth once that was cooked.  Added lemon and pepper a once it was cooked.  It was delicious.

Just like Dale, I'm a big fan of Legal Sea Food's sautéed mussels.  I have made this recipe twice with his suggestion of cutting the amount of white wine down to half.  However, I noticed the taste difference due to the type of wine I used each time I made it: French chardonnay and domestic sauvignon blanc.  As Jazz mentioned, this dish is best made with chardonnay. It gives it a more delicate flavor that blends well with butter and garlic.  I also felt the amount of red pepper flakes was a bit too overpowering.

We really liked this recipe so we wove it into my usual recipe, using this basic recipe and including several additions. Last time I made this exact recipe, it seemed it was lacking somehow; so I reverted a bit to incorporate more flavor, at least for us. Chef John is my go-to because he has so many great recipes and videos, and I know each recipe will please all. I rarely divert from his guidance! I think in the many years I’ve followed him, only one recipe wasn’t the excellence I was accustomed to. All the others quickly became my favorites, bar none.

Excellent & Easy! Increased butter, cut wine in half, doubled garlic, added leaks and shallots - just because I had them on hand. Mussels were from Costco - came in a 5lb bag - they were very good size. Twin 14 year olds gobbled them up while they soaked bread in the delicious broth. Recipe is a keeper! Happy 2017!

Outstanding! The brightness brought by the lemon zest nicely balances the savory garlic and mussel broth.
Anyone have a creative recipe to use the leftover broth?

Used mussles from Costco, took a long time to scrub those musseles. 
I did not like them at all right after came out from a pot,  I was even thinking of dump them to a waste basket. However, I changed my mind because John's recipes are usually  very good.
So,  I  removed meat from shells, kept them in fridge over night.
Wow, they were so good despite I am not even mussele fan, I may make it again!

This is THE mussels recipe. Simple, light, and lovely. I kind of take credit for it (sorry chef John) but I make this over and over again. 
I use different fresh herb depending on what I have in my frigo, regardless the broth is what makes it.

I would like to give it a 4.8 but that isn't an option.  I lived in western Washington and could bike to Penn Cove and harvest mussels a bit more mature than commercial mussels and took a bit more wine.  Two cups of wine for 2 lbs mussels is more than needed for commercial mussels.  One cup plus some vegetable broth is better.

Today I made the recipe using 4 lbs commercial Penn Cove mussels, substituting 2 bottles of lager beer for the wine and it came out better than with wine.  My spouse gave it a 9.5.  I skipped the parsley and threw in a couple sprigs of fresh basil blossom in the last minute.

We will now have mussels and pasta with alfredo sauce tomorrow

So giving the recipe 3 stars  is only to talk about my own bad choice. The recipe calls for "white wine," so I used Sauvignon Blanc because that's what we drink for a white these days.  Will go with a Chardonnay, chablis or even a dry Riesling next time.  Wrong choice. Still edible, but not the mind blowing experience eating mussels usually is.

We loved this recipe!  It is easy and the mussels were delicious.  I served it with french bread toasted with butter, which we used to sop up the broth.  I didn't change the recipe at all.

Great recipe. I made it few times already and it came out just great. Usually I change the bread for fettuccine pasta and double the butter. I recommend this recipe to everyone.

This is my go to when I make mussels. I use it as a base then check my fridge.  Beer or wine it's always good!. Except I always add a spicy sausage and right at the end add some cream.

It wasn't BAD, but I certainly won't use this recipe again.  I uses tons of wine which dominates the flavor.  Instead of a balanced flavor that brings out the freshness of the mussels, it just overpowers it.  I prefer a recipe that cuts the wine with chicken broth.  The times for cooking were too long.  some of the mussels dried out.  It turned out good enough to eat, but not good.

Chef John's recipes rarely disappoint, but this just wasn't good. I made the recipe exactly as written, but increased the portions. I used a Chardonnay white wine. The "sauce" wasn't good and tasted too tart. I think this recipe could have benefited from equal parts chicken stock and white wine. I won't be making this again.

OMG OMG OMG - our local seafood store sells cleaned cooked frozen mussels.  Always looking for a good way to serve them.  This was fantastic.  Only thing I did different was use unsalted butter because that was all I had.  Didn't miss the salt.  Will be making this again and again.

I liked this dish but as I was eating the mussels I was hoping for a little more flavour...not the occasional hint of lemon.  My father taught me to put a few tablespoons of corn meal in water and then add the muscles, they will eat the corn meal and filter out any sand. I used pinot grigio and added a shallot. If I make this again I will use half the amount of wine and add 1/2 cup of non flavoured coffee creamer, tempered.

I loved this recipe, made as written with the exception that I added a little cream to the sauce, had them with oven baked Sweet Potato fries and French bread, very easy and tasty, will make again for sure.

Easy great recipe!  The main thing is to CLEAN/Burp the Mussels by letting them soak in some water with flower or salt for a while before debearding.

Huge garlic fan so appreciated the amount used. Flavor wise seemed to be missing something and a bit thin if using as sauce for pasta. Sopping up the sauce with the bread was great. So plan to do something extra if making into a pasta sauce, otherwise if just mussels its pretty yummy and the mussels are tender and not rubbery.

My first time cleaning mussels and was a little intimidated at first, but after the first few it was easy.  Super easy recipe, great flavor, just the right amount of heat - it was there but didn't punch you in the face.  

Note: I used a $20 bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.  

I made this *exactly* according to the recipe - ingredients and procedure.  Next time I might add just a bit of flour with hope of giving the broth a little body.

*You can't give a recipe 5 stars and then say that you can't wait to try it!!  And you can't rate a recipe and then describe the dozen ways you altered it!   :-)

I love mussels, and this recipe is my new favorite. It's wonderful how fast this comes together, and the flavor is great. I used an inexpensive but decent pinot grigio - half in the pot, the other half to drink with dinner! :-)

Doubled butter, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Used Pinot Grigio as it goes well with seafood. Solid mix of ingredients for a tasty dipping broth! Also, very easy and fast if you're looking for a quick dinner option.

I would give this 3 stars however hubby who  still gets a little  nudgey about mussels liked it a lot.  He liked the citrus flavor which really came through. I did pick up  some heat from the red pepper but it was more of a kick and not overpowering. Will probably make it again.

The first time I made the recipe exactly as written and thought the flavor was weak. When I made it again, I added about a tablespoon of Better than Bouillon, Chicken flavor, to the wine sauce and that made it amazing! My first time rating would have been 3 stars.

I've made this several times. I love that it is so simple and quick. It's great as is, and is also a great recipe to make changes to, to accommodate personal preference or different food pairings. One hint: make sure you get your shellfish from a source who takes the time to really clean them. Otherwise, take the time to soak them to de-sand them and debeard them yourself. Keep up with the great contributions, Chef John!

This is seriously the best tasting dish I have made from this site. I halved the recipe for 1 lb of mussels (since it was just for me) , but I kept the butter at 2 Tablespoons. Then I sprinkled the serving  bowl with just a little kosher sea salt--which really added to the looks and flavor, I think. The fresh parsley and red pepper are a must. I'm still dipping my crusty bread in the broth as I write. I have had mussels in fine restaurants world wide and this is as good if not better. Please don't go adding  cream to this if you want to fresh mussels at their finest.

Just made this for a NYE appetizer.  Took some of the recommendations and adjusted by using 1 c. dry white wine, 1 c. Vegetable Stock, 6 cloves garlic, 4 T butter, and 1 tsp red pepper flakes.  Just before serving topped it with a little heavy cream.  Served with warm French bread and YUMMM!!  Next time I'll cook the broth down a bit and use even more garlic.  Thanks for a keeper recipe!!

Made them for the first time. My husband loves mussels so there was definite pressure :) He LOVED them!! A neighbor stopped by to visit and tried several and raved they were delicious and tasted like a chef made them...I'll definitely make again!!

I did use 2 tsp Gilroy Farms minced garlic and 3 Tbsp of lite butter.

I love mussels and decided to try cooking it. I tweaked the ingredients and added more flavor. I added 4 tbl spoon of butter, 2 cups of dry white wine, red crushed peppers, 1 cup of tomato puree,  red sliced onions, 1 whole sliced sweet bell red peppers, 4-5 sprigs of thyme, 1 cup of chopped fresh parsley, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 2 bags of cooked shrimp, and 3 lbs of debeard mussels.
 
I had the onions, garlic, peppers, thyme, parsley, and 3 tlb spoons of butter simmer n caramelize first. Then I added my homemade seasonings,pepper and the crushed peppers until all the ingredients were blended. Then I added the wine and left it cooking for about 2 min and then added the tomato puree. I left that cook for 2 more min then I added shrimps and the mussels. I added 1 table spoon of butter and covered it. I only uncovered it to stir the mussels. I cooked it until the mussels opened and the shrimp were cooked. It taste so good. I think if I would have used the original recipe alone, without adding my zest then it wouldn't have tasted as good. The broth was spicy n amazing. We all had the garlic bread dipped in the broth. I also cooked bow tie pasta (al dente) and added the broth to it and it was a winning dish in my house. Spent about $50 it fed four people and had left overs.

I followed the recipe exactly, using Pinot grigio for the wine.  And it was a bit less than ok. My guests liked it, though, so it gets 3 stars.  Maybe if I used beer?

We enjoyed these mussels, and a pound per person worked out perfectly, too.  Next time, I will add more butter to the dipping sauce, but that's just a personal taste preference.

I picked up 2 pounds of PEI mussels the other day and had no idea what to do with them.  So I searched my go to site and found this recipe, all I can say is fabulous!!!  A little too much heat for me so I will reduce the red pepper flakes next time.  I think trying this with red winw would be great too.  Thanks so much!!

I look forward to following the recipe exactly next time, but even with the substitutes I had to make, it was wonderful. Instead of lemon zest, I used dried lemon peel, and fresh parsley was replaced by dried parsley.

This is amazing! I used 1 1/2 cups of wine and 1/4 cup whipping cream. I also used a whole stick of butter and 6 fresh pieces of minced garlic! Next time I will do the same but I’m going to try it with beer! We made cheesy garlic bread with it! Was so amazing to dip it in that delicious sauce!!! I would also make shrimp in that same sauce!!!! My husband is still talking about it!!!

I plan on making again. For me, I used roasted bell pepper from jar also, but want more butter and garlic flavor. Plan on steaming in wine then putting it in pot with wine, whole stick of butter, garlic and the roasted bell peppers.

Delicious! I first tried this in France w/o lemon zest but with shopped shallots instead. This small change does not make a significant difference.  Great recipe!

Delicious, light meal on a hot summer night! Mussels are quite healthy for you, too. I cut back on the wine, and there was still plenty of liquid. Nice summer or anytime dish!

I’m a novice and saw how “easy” this looked. I must have chosen an awful Pinot Grigio because I love steamed mussels but couldn’t even eat much of it. I’d say the wine means a lot more than inferred.

I love drunken mussels and usually like Chef John's recipes  but this one is not good.  Two cups of wine is way too much and combined with the lemon zest was just horrible.  Going to look for another recipe.

Very good! I added diced tomatoes and thyme. I would have added more garlic since recipe was doubled. Heavy cream as recommended by reviews is a great idea for next time.

I would scale back the white wine a tiny bit, maybe about 20% less, but otherwise, it was wonderful - light and flavourful. (just a bit too "watery" with that much wine).

Very bland and had a wine aftertaste. The mussles themselves were good but the sauce was nasty. If I made this again...yeah I would never make it again.

Good flavor.
Next time I would cut down or eliminate the red pepper flakes.
The mussels I used were quite small.i wonder if using larger mussels  might wok better in this recipe.

Made it, and would highly recommend it to all.  But I continue to wonder why folks change the recipe, sometimes radically, and then rate it 5 stars.  RATE THIS RECIPE.  Have one for us to try? Submit it!

Shocked at how bad this recipe is despite all the positive reviews... I cooked this recipe almost exactly as directed (I added half a shallot with the garlic) and excluded the parsley.  Let me start by saying that I'm a BIG mussel fan, and I love white wine (who doesn't?!) ... I used a nice bottle of white to cook this recipe thinking it was going to be a winner.  How wrong.  It came out tasting like dry white wine, heavy on the alcohol side, without much other flavor.  I get that this is a 'drunken mussels' recipe but it really wasn't good and the alcohol overpowered the mussels.  What a waste of good seafood!  The dish also needed salt, lots of salt, so that should give you a clue at how badly this dish was lacking.   Save your mussels and look for another recipe... THIS WAS NOT GOOD!  :(

This was actually very simple to make. I used a little extra red pepper flakes and a little bit of chopped tomatoes.   I would make this again.

Such a simple recipe and definitely a crowd pleaser!  I might add some more butter to get the broth a bit saltier, or maybe just add some salt, lol.

This was pretty good. It could have used a little more depth and range on the flavors, though. 

I'll definitely try this again with a different wine. I used a dry Riesling, and maybe something with brighter notes would work better. 

On the other end of the spectrum, it could be good with a few spoons of sherry, or maybe even whisky, and a twist of black pepper. 

Overall, pretty good but not life-changing.

i 
added some stuff because i had a very limited number of mussels to work with. first i added some clam meat just before the wine(just to give them something more to eat, i just sauteed it in the butter until i felt satisfied) followed the recipe after that until the parsley. in lui of parsley i opted for loose cut spinach and cherry tomatoes(sliced in half) added at the time i was supposed to add the parsley . also tossed in a bit of italian seasoning(it needed it with the spinach and matos)  loved this recipe thanks for posting

Amazing! So easy, so good... Look no further for a recipe. I never made them before because I was afraid to mess them up. They were easy as can be & taste like they are  from a gourmet restaurant! Cleaning takes a bit of time so allow yourself the time to rinse & scrub. Mine had no sand but I rinsed & scrubbed anyway.

Well I screwed up and used probably 4 times as much red pepper it calls for, and it was still great, just extra-spicy.

Really good broth but this recipe had me on my toes with how fast I had to stir, boil,  cover and repeat.  I might try to find a less rapid cooking method.

Only mussels on a half-shell were available, they had been steamed already but were only partially cooked. I also used dry vermouth instead of white wine. Delicious & easy. Will make again.

These are Perfect & FAST go to meal!!! Especially if your mussels are already cleaned. I have made these quite a few times now. I have used white cooking wine because I always have on hand & McCormick's Fiery 5 Pepper flakes. YUM!!!!!! Thank you for another simple & great recipe

GREAT! Loved it, but a word to the wise, it was seriously spicy. If I was making this dish for multiple people, I would cut the red pepper down to maybe 1/4 tsp, maybe even 1/8 teaspoon. Didn't have any bread, but 5 stars anyways. Also, I used pinot grigio for the wine, and I think it was excellent.

Cook as directed after you prep the mussels properly. I didn't have heavy cream so I added no more than 1/8 cup of half n half to the sauce once finished for the bread soak only. Absolutely delicious!! Some people wanted more bread after the mussels were devoured to soak up the sauce!!

Fantastic recipe loved by the 5 people who attended dinner at my place. Served with salad and bread then cheese & icecream with macerated fruit.  It's very light so there's room for more food afterwards. The chili flakes add something special. Forgot to give lemon wedges. Just straight up great, no additions. Rave reviews from friends.

If I could rate this a six I would. I just used more garlic and a tiny bit more red pepper. Best mussels I've ever had! Making them for the second time tonight!

Made this with linguine, it was great! Only thing I changed was adding a little cream to make the sauce a little thicker for the noodles! It was wonderful!

Thanks for posting a recipe home cooks can do! So many recipes have 85 steps and require equipment I'd never buy. This is easy and really lovely. I'm also serving lobster rolls and spinach.

We love this dish when we eat out and other attempts to make it at home failed, until this recipe. Better than any restaurant and it was so very easy. It will be a regular on the home menu and entertaining.

taste was good, not outstanding, but because of the simplicity, it gets 4 stars. make it even easier, just grill the mussels, then drizzle the sauce over them in a bowl.

This had mixed reviews at our house.  My daughter loved it and thought it was very flavorful.  I didn't care for it.  Ah well, if we were all alike it would be a boring world.

The is a great basic mussel recipe - hard to go wrong and it definitely hit the spot!  If you are looking for a standard, tried and true mussel recipe, this is it.  Chef John always seems to have the recipes you can count on!

I squeezed lemon juice in there as well.. I used moscato wine cause it was all I had at the time and it was actually very good with it. This recipe is great.
