This recipe was great!  I did some modification however.  I shredded the carrots with a food processor and threw in 2 garlic cloves and 1 small onion.  Then I added some hemp seed, some flax seed, and some oat bran along with the breadcrumbs and flour.  I increased to 5 eggs because of the extra dry ingredients.  Ate it like a burger w/ mayo, tahini, mustard, sliced cukes and sprouts.  Yum!  My 2 year old ate almost 2 patties for lunch!

I hesitate to give this a 5 star because I changed it so much... but what I did end up with was excellent. I didn't have even a half pound of shredded carrots so subbed in some potato. I shredded 1 large potato, then rinsed it in cold water, & squeezed out the excess water.  Next I took about 3 cups of shredded carrots and put them in the microwave for 30 sec bursts three or four times (until they seemed to soften some... I wanted them to be done when the potatoes were done,) stirring between each burst. Then I mixed the potato and carrot together with seasonings (salt, garlic, onion powder, salt, a dash of cayenne and black pepper.)  Added 1/3 cup barely cooked finely chopped onions (again I used the microwave) and a couple of tablespoons of flour mixing well.  I molded them into patties as firmly as I could and fried them in an oiled pan over medium heat(I brushed my nonstick pan with oil.) Just before I turned the patties over I put about a 1/4 tsp of butter on top of each patty, which gave them excellent flavor and kept them from burning. (No eggs and no crumbs at all.) HINT: Like hashbrowns they stick together best if you wait until the bottom is somewhat crisp before you turn them, and don't keep turning them over and over again.

As a vegetarian, I have these as a main dish over some saffron rice. A dash of curry powder gives it a nice kick, too.

I noticed some of the reviewers weren't too pleased with this and I paid attention to their reasons carefully because knowing my family and our tastes, something told me to try this recipe anyway.  I am grateful I did.  First off..."thanks for sharing this, Haggith!".  I added some chopped leeks with ours because I had them leftover from another dinner.  Next time I may add a stronger onion or maybe even caramelize the leeks first because the recipe "as is" could use a little lift.  I'm sure onion soup mix could help if you can stand the salt.  I still give this 5 stars because of the entire package;  the idea, the use of carrots, how well it cooked, and because it was pleasing to look at (has potential to be even more colorful with different ingredients).  However, I didn't like how messy it was to patty them (but who does?!?).  These will be fun to play around with in the future.  Thanks again.

The taste was very good,but my patties kept falling apart in the frying pan!I scaled the recipe for two(me and hubby)and only added one egg as opposed to two.I also added more garlic for flavor and made a delicious dipping sauce of soy sauce and lime juice.I will try and make these again because the flavor is tasty..

THANK YOU HAGGITH! I am a carrot freak and am always looking for simple, flavorful carrot recipes.  Boy do I love these!  I prepared them basically as written (used whole wheat bread crumbs and a GIGANTIC clove of garlic - about the size of 3 average cloves).  I saw that I was out of regular vegetable oil so I used my olive oil.  YUM!  I think frying in olive oil and using the giant garlic clove were the two keys to success here.  I served topped with plain yogurt and walnuts.  Those of you who thought they were bland and added all kinds of spices, and gooped them up with chili sauce and soy sauce and who-knows-what should try frying them in olive oil and letting the delicious flavor of these patties through!  I am also confused about why some thought they fell apart.  I had no trouble with that.

Really great flavors -- fresh and savory. I added freshly minced ginger. Next time I'll make an accomanying soy/ginger/garlic dipping sauce. After watching my vegetable-averse friends gobble these down, I knew I'd found a favorite!

I followed directions exactly and no one in my family liked them. Bland with a weird texture and tasted like eggs. Maybe they might be better if boiled, mashed and mixed with sugar and cinammon and then formed and fried...Sorry to those who did like them but I really wonder how it got 4 stars...

This recipe was amazing! I did add some fresh grated parmesan cheese to it, but I'm sure it would be great with out that as well. This recipe is perfect to update/change to your taste.

With whole wheat flour and pam spray, this makes a pretty healthy snack. Some chilli sauce on this, and it's pretty yummy

I had trouble getting the patties to hold together.  I thought they were a little bland.  I like the basic recipe, though, and I'll try some adjustments to suit myself.  Thanks!

This is a great base for a unique vegetarian dish.  As is, I found it a little bland, and a little too wet to hold together well.  That being said, I like a lot of spice and flavor in my food.  Like many others, I read some of the other reviews for ideas to modify this and came up with something I thought was really good.  This recipe made about 8 thin hamburger sized patties, the first half I followed the recipe.  To the second half I added (roughly) 1/4 cup italian bread crumbs, 2 tsp. curry powder and 1 tsp. ginger paste.  The result reminded me of indian dishes I've had, and I think it would be great with some rice as a main dish.  I dipped it in soy sauce and it was great!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I found this somewhat tasteless, even though I added onion and Jalapeno pepper.  However it did hold up well, and I will try again perhaps adding chil.

I liked them though my daughter was a little less sure. I think they could have used a little more flavor but they make a great starting off point and are pretty yummy by themselves. My daughter ate hers with a little maple syrup and I mashed together 2 tbs avacado and 1 tbs sour cream as a topping. Applesauce would work as well (just like potato pancakes). I think that next time I will use a variety of shredded veggies like potatoes, zucchini, and/or parsnips. I think it would also have benefitted from some sauted onion or leek.

These were just ok as written. I grated half of an onion and added 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. They needed a bit of salt so I just did that to taste after they were cooked. I ate mine with sour cream.

Mmmm . . . Mmmm  . . . Mmmm these are soo good . I never would have thought to make something like this. The only difference in that I used italian bread crumbs because thats all I had but I don't think it made much of a difference.

These were delicious!!!  I added a squirt of dijon mustard to the mix and used italian bread crumbs and there was plenty of flavour.  Fried them in a little EVOO and as a non-veggie lover hubby and I ate these with a spinach salad for supper.  No meat needed!!  Will make again and again as hubby already asked could we have them tonight.  Next time I will add a dash of nutmeg and perhaps some greek seasoning or just play with wahtever spices we feel like using.  GREAT RECIPE!!!

Not good.  Tasted like NOTHING.  Ate it like a hamburger, not good.  Ate it like a pancake, not good.  Ended up dousing it with soy sauce and forcing it down.  Still not good.

We love this recipe but it's way too much sodium for my husband who has congestive heart failure.  Most bread crumbs are also too high in sodium.  I use 1/4 c. cracker meal instead of the crumbs, and a Mrs. Dash seasoning such as Lemon Pepper or Herbs and Garlic.  I also use matchstick carrots; sometimes I use them "as is" which makes an interesting patty.  I also give them a whirl in my food processor if I want to avoid the "haystack" look.  AND they make a great veggie burger on a whole grain bun!   My 3 and 5 year-old grandkids ate and loved them.

very good recipe.  my kids really enjoyed it and they were easy to make.  for adults, a bit too bland and i would have liked to have a dipping sauce recipe along with the patties.  i made mine into about 2 inch rounds to serve as side items.

Delicious! I added more whole wheat flour and egg to make sure they stuck together well, they worked wonderful. Just used a spoon to  pour a bit of batter into the pan then used the spoon to flatten into a patty.

Very simple recipe, I made this and it was delicious! I made half fried and half baked - the carrot loses is sweetness when fried and becomes oily, but when baked on 180c for 50 minutes its still sweet and not oily at all. Now I know most people don't like it sweet, including me, but my mother absolutely loved it baked, and I loved it fried. I see no fault in this recipe. Thank you very much.

This was an odd flavor that no one in the family liked. I don't know if it was my prep, or how I created the patty but it was not edible.

It's okay. Kind of like eating a slightly sweet mini omelet. Could use a little more salt and some other spices. Good enough for a snack.

I added mushrooms, green onions and extra garlic. Next time I'll add a little shredded parm cheese.  These tasted great, but I used all fresh ingredients, including carrots and onions straight from my garden. This would be nice with a little kick--ginger, curry, etc.

It is too bland I spite of too much pepper.  I tried spread butter, then salt, then seasoned salt.  None helped.

I loved the flavor of these, but they did not stick together.  Another egg would have helped.  I added green onion because I didn't have enough carrot and I dipped them in soy sauce.

Yum - I loved this.. and so did my husband and 1 1/2 year old!  I made it just as written, but I lightly cooked the garlic first to make it a little more subtle.  I would definitely make this again.  I might even grate some other veggies into it if I have them around.  But it is delicious just with carrots!

This is a great recipe. I mixed it up a lot and added onion, mushroom and jalapenio. A lot more garlic and salt and pepper with a bit of cayenne for some additional kick. This was delicious over rice! I am amking it again and instead of cayenne I'll use Curry as the flavores seem like they'll really blend.

This was an easy recipe, but I wasn't altogether impressed. I really like cooked carrots, but didn't enjoy these. I expected them to be more flavorful, but found that this recipe was bland. If I make them again, I'll try adding more and different spices.

I thought these were good. I did add more garlic and one small minced onion.  I used 2 eggs instead of 4.  These were a hit with my family.

Surprisingly popular--I don't know anyone yet who hasn't liked them. They do tend to fall apart in the pan, so it is a good idea to add a little extra of whatever you want to add so that they hold together a bit better.

This is a good substitute for steak. My two year old liked it. From other reviews, I took it would need more spices, so I used 3 cloves of garlic, and some steak pepper seasoning, and also I used 1 cup of whole wheat bread crumbs instead of 1/4 so it would hold better. I dropped teaspoons of the mix in the frying pan and made the patties from there. Quite tasty.

Nothing picture worthy but definitely a keeper recipe! As suggested in reviews below, used up some potatoes I needed to get rid of besides having a sams club size bag of carrots I needed to do something with quickly , love those kitchen sink/ clean out the fridge recipes !! .....and added dried minced onion, as well as chili flakes and paprika, delicious!! Just ensure you squeeze out the liquid from the potatoes after grating and before you incorporate into the shredded carrots. As a testament to the worthiness of this recipe, my husband is not a carrot fan and he devoured them. Also a great way to use up some homemade applesauce, really paired well with the carrots. I would think this would be a great alternative to your typical meatless Monday or trying to get kids to experiment with vegetables. I’m tempted next time to make it entirely sweet and leave out everything savory, maybe incorporate some raisins and walnuts ... or not ... and finish with some cream cheese icing ;)

Skip trying to make patties before setting in small cast iron skillet, just nudge them into shape.  One patty at a time cooked very slowly over low heat. I used goose grease, kitchen gold it is called,  because it is like molecule magic. The brown stays on the food, not stuck to the pan. Such a good basic recipe! You could doll these up in a million ways! Sweet potato  instead of carrot works too!

They are a bit bland so I spiced them up with turmeric, cumin and cayenne pepper (just a dash each).  It IS a super-easy recipe and I will definitely be making this again.

I want to try this again but with potatoes because these are basically egg-y hashbrowns. The carrots add a slightly sweet taste that I do like its just potatoes are more classic for stuff like this.

These were OK. I read the other reviews and decided to add ingredients as suggested. I added chives (didn't have any onions on hand but plenty of chives on the lawn), green pepper, cumin, and used 2 eggs instead of 4. Next time I will add more spices, as they still came out pretty bland despite the garlic, cumin, salt and pepper. A sauce would help too.

My family loved these! Make sue they are not too thick or you will get somewhat of a paste-like texture. I will definitely make these again!  :)

worked perfectly! (i had to substitute panko and garlic powder for bread crumbs and garlic cloves- wound up a little plain because of this) They held together perfectly in the skillet, which is what I was worried about.

I like these because they are both sweet and savoury. The only thing I changed was that I added a  chopped onion to the batter. Great recipe!

This was better than I thought they would be. I had a lot of leftover carrots in the fridge and didn't know what to do with them. This was a excellent idea and recipe. I will be making these again.

I followed the directions almost perfectly, I only changed the amount of carrots- instead of 1 lbs, I grated 10 oz.
I served this dish for breakfast for two people. It's great as a base! You can modify the recipe by adding a topping (I served with avocado and cherry tomatoes) or adding ingredients to the base like finely chopped onion or grated cheese.

Thank you for sharing a recipe! I gave you five stars because the recipe is simple, easy to make and really healthy!

Love these! Added some curry, cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, and cayenne, because I love curried carrots. ^.^ Also needs a bit more salt

I just made this. I second those who, despite following the recipe to a 'T', were left with a messy glob of a horrible concoction. I do not recommend this.

This is second time I make carrot patties using different recipes. I came to this conclusion that carrot patties are not that good because they get a unpleasant eggy taste and this is despite me only using one egg and making the patties super thin to ensure cooking it through. Short and simple don't waste your carrots on patties!!

It has potential.  It turned out somewhat bland.  I did forget to add the garlic.  I think adding a little more garlic and maybe some onion would really enhance the taste.  Great way to use my extra carrots though.

Great recipe. finally something different with carrots, however I had to make some adjustments.  I used an onion as well as all the carrots suggested.  same amount of flour and bread crumb but I thru in some garlic powder and some cilantro (1 tsp and 1 tbs respectively) also I only used 2 eggs.  Should have made a dip for them.  Either way they were great.

I made this according to the recipe given. I liked them my husband did Not. They reminded me of egg-fu-young. They were just lacking in something I should have put onion and more spice in them. We love spicy food so this was just too bland for us, but like I said I liked them. I guess there just not for everybody.

Not sure where I went wrong, but this was way too wet to make patties.  Added a bunch more breadcrumbs and then that messed up the ratio between the carrots and crumbs.  Will give this one more try though and reduce the number of eggs and increase the amount of carrots.

These are good but I thought they needed a little salt to balance the sweetness of the carrots.

Very easy and tasty!  Good way to use up lots of carrots at once.
