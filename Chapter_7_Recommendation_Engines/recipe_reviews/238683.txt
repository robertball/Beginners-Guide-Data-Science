My girlfriend said I have now ruined restaraunt chicken salads for her. Thanks for the recipe! We made a few altercations based off our preference but hey, it's a salad, can't do too much harm, right?!

The lime juice dressing really didn't add much flavor or "pizzazz" to make this salad noteworthy.  I liked all the rest of the ingredients though & will be finding my own lime dressing next time.

I made some minor changes for what I had on hand. I used jarred roasted red peppers, cucumbers instead of jicama. I tossed the lettuce with a small amount of Italian dressing, the remaining ingredients I used lime juice. I made a fresh chicken breast, chopped it up and mixed it with Guy Fieri's Asian BBQ sauce. My husband loved it. we will make again!

A lovely, fresh, and flavorful summer salad!  I cubed chicken breasts and cooked in taco seasoning before tossing with the bbq sauce.  I could not find jicama so used radishes instead and I forgot the basil but feel it may have been a bit out of place anyway.  I also added diced pepper jack cheese which added a nice kick and topped with crushed tortilla chips.  I was worried that I would miss having dressing but didn't!  The lime juice was perfect and enhanced all the other fresh flavors!  Will definitely make again and again!

I thought it was a good recipe.  It was flavorful and easy.  I had to use dried Basil and fresh chicken breast sliced into tenders, cooked in a pan with olive oil and added bbq sauce when the chicken was done.  Slow cooked
For a few more minutes and it was very good.  No dressing and just the lime juice was perfect.

Didnâ€™t see any tomatoes in the recipe ingredients, but did in the picture. Since they are so good right now, I had to add them. Great! Loved by all!

Delicious and easy! I made it after a day of running around in about 15 minutes. I left out the carrots and the jimaca, however, and finished it by LIGHTLY tossing it with a light ranch dressing. My boyfriend liked it simply with lime juice, though. Either way... It turned out great!
