Delicious!  Pretty quick, too.  Of course, I ended up making a few changes, but the basics are the same.  Rather than a can of stewed tomatoes, I used a can of diced, seasoned with basil, garlic, and oregano.  Doubled the tomato sauce because I just wanted to use the whole can.  I'm glad I did, because even with the extra tomato sauce I couldn't use all of the pasta I cooked, it would have been too dry.  I guess I used about 2/3 of the 16 oz box that I cooked.  No big deal there.  I also cooked chopped onion with the turkey.  As the sauce cooked, I sprinkled all kinds of spices in...it was a bit bland for our tastes without it.  I added seasoned salt, paprika, red pepper, italian seasoning, extra basil, and a bunch of chili powder.  So, so good, I've been thinking about the leftovers all evening.  Not a fancy meal, but wonderful and filling.  Thank You!  (Would have been great with a salad, as suggested)

At our house we like spicy.  To rev up this recipe I added 1/4 chopped white onion, 1/4 chopped green pepper, 1-2 chopped cloves garlic and 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper to the ground turkey before browning.  This ensures the flavors will get cooked into the meat.  I stuck to the original recipe to finish out the dish, but added more basil than suggested.  This is a regular in our house now.

Oh I liked this ALOT.  The kids went back for seconds.  I would love to give this 5 stars but the recipe is far to bland...Things I did different... I added some paprika, chilli powder and italian seasonings along with some salt and pepper. I also ended up using a whole 10 oz can of tomato sauce which is more than 1 cup(what the recipe calls for).  I finished off the leftovers for lunch this afternoon and it tasted just as good as it did last night for dinner. Thanks I will definately make this again with of course my added spices of preference!!

I spiced up the turkey by adding onions, garlic & italian seasoning to it while it browned.  I didnt use the sugar or the basil when adding sauce.  I used canned already seasoned diced tomatoes (instead of stewed)& a can of seasoned tomato sauce.  This was VERY easy & turned out great.  My husband didnt even mind that I used Turkey!

Delicious!  My husband and I cannot eat red
meat and he always complained that I could
not make goulash like his mother's.  We
both loved it.

I had used chicken cut into small bits instead, but other than that, I stuck closely with the recipe. But unfortunately, it turned out really bland... Not something I would make again... :(

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. I was in need of something relatively quick with ingredients I had on hand, which was minimal because I really need to go grocery shopping. I cut the ground turkey and pasta in half since I was the only one eating, but kept everything else the same. Used italian diced tomatoes (they are already seasoned with garlic, basil, and oregano), added some crushed red pepper and ground black pepper, and added a can of mushrooms. Also used rotini instead since that is what I had. Very good, will make again. Thanks!

I added more seasonings and a cup of
peas for color. Next time,I'll play 
around with other vegetables, to make
this a one-dish meal.

Loved it! I used wheat pasta and that was a mistake, as it took away from the flavor! But other than that, the recipe was fabulous! Thanks :)

Excellent; but the recipe as written was a little dry for me. I doubled the tomatoes and the tomato sauce.

Yuum! I love that it uses turkey, instead of beef and you can't even tell! It's so simple, but so good. My hubby couldn't get enough of it and gave it rave reviews.

Very easy dish to put together but read the other reviews and really needed to add ingredients to add flavor. Must add Bell pepper and onion for more flavor.

Pretty good.  I give this a 3 star because as you all seem to know, you have to change it drastically to give it flavor.  I too used two jars of sauce and diced tomato.  As for the seasoning, I used green peppers, onions, basil, chili powder (lots), Italian seasoning, garlic, chipotle, paprika, and salt to taste.  I left the sugar out because I tried using healthy ingredients.  No need for sugar.

This was all right... I had high hopes for this recipe but it came out a little bland at the end.  It smelled really, really good but the taste didn't match its aroma.  My husband agreed.  I used all the ingredients listed.  When I poured the stewed tomatoes in, I also poured in the liquid because I wasn't sure whether or not to do that.  So the dish also came out a little runny.  Anyways, this was a really easy recipe to make so I'll make it again, but maybe with some added ingredients to give it some more zest.

Like many other reviewers, I doctored this recipe up with Italian spices, red pepper and season salt. I used a whole tsp of basil. The reason I only gave this 2 stars is because I thought it was bland until I doctored it up thus changing the recipe from the original. It's nothing special in my book.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS and you don't even taste the difference between the turkey and Hamburger...and its much better for you.  The only thing I do differently is use more garlic.  There can never be enough garlic.

This was very good.  Made as directed (using ground chicken) and I was expecting it to be a bit bland, but didn't find that at all.  
My husband and 3 year old loved it.
Will make it again!
Thanks for sharing.

This is a quick and easy recipe, for sure, but it seriously lacked any depth of flavor. I may try it again, next time putting more flavorings like onions and garlic with the turkey as it browns. But as-is, the recipe is one-dimensional.

This was easy and delicious! I also made a few changes. I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, half of a chopped onion, 1/4 tsp dried oregano, 1/4 tsp of thyme, fresh basil instead of dried. And to add flavor to my noodles, I always boil them in chicken broth. Everyone loved it.

This is a great basic meal using lighter ingredients for a tight budget. When I make this for my family, I spice up my turkey meat with homemade italian seasoning, a large onion, whole wheat pasta and organic ingredients. This can be bendable to add almost anything you have on hand. If you're really on a tight budget and want to stretch out your meat to two meals, you can either use the full amount of meat and add in equal amounts of whatever chopped fresh veggies your family likes (we like zucchini, spinach and carrot) OR you can cut the meat in half and add in half chopped veggies. It's really filling, cheap to make and reheats well.

This turned out very good!  I used ingredient substitutes that I had on hand.  Ground chicken breast, a can of diced tomatoes with green peppers & onion, and Prego Chunky Garden Italian Mushroom Supreme with portobello mushrooms sauce.  I used fresh chopped basil that I'm growing, probably about 1 Tbs. I added chopped red onion, paprika, and Tabasco green pepper sauce.  I also used whole wheat pasta and topped the finished dish with a little feta crumbles. Will definitely make this again and I am going to try to freeze the sauce.

Super delish!  Following the advise of other reviewers I added mushrooms, onions, tomato paste, and lots of spices (oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, red pepper, chili powder, cilantro, ground pepper and dash of salt).  And doubled the garlic.

Good basic recipe but way too much pasta to be a goulash, I think.  I used a full 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, a full 28 oz. can of stewed, diced tomatoes and less pasta than called for (a 13oz. box of higher fiber rotini pasta) and it was still too much.  I futzed around with additional garlic, some dried oregano, more basil, no sugar but next time will try adding an extra can of tomato sauce, frozen corn, olives, etc.  It's a great way to stretch a pound of ground turkey.  I'll make it again.

Nice and sweet tasting. I cooked the ground turkey with extra garlic. Added extra basil to the tomato mixture as well. Beware that the tomato mixture was more for flavor and wasn't really a sauce, so if you do want a saucy pasta you will need to add something more. Boyfriend enjoyed and so did I - would make again as is.

Cooked this for the fam last night and the kids loved it. And since I have a picky 2 year old, that was a blessing. I didn't have any basil on hand, but I don't think that made a difference. I added a small can of tomato paste to thicken up the sauce a bit and used elbow noodles as shown in the pic instead of bow tie. This is a nice hearty meal with plenty of leftovers.

Great comfort food. Virtually foolproof to prepare. You definitely need to add spices to suit your tastes. You also might want to add more tomato sauce, as there isn't a whole lot once the turkey tomato mixture simmers. This is an easy one to playground with. I might add some chopped spinach or a bit of zucchini next time... and there definitely will be a next time!

This is a simple recipe. I added black olives, green pepper, and onion, and garnished with cheese. You can add any veggie. Def needds alot of seasoning too. Overall pretty good and easy.

I thought that this was a good base recipe, but I only used 10 oz of turkey instead of a pound and there was way more than enough meat - too much, really.  Next time I will double up on the tomato and other ingredients then freeze the leftovers for another day.

Update: I have made this several times since the first review and it has become a favorite basic dinner. I use half the pasta and top with a dolop of sour cream. ////This was good but I agree with other reviews, there is was too much pasta. I left out about a 1/4 of my pasta but I wish had left out 1/2. I added additional Italian seasoning. It's pretty basic but good. A good dish for kids, too!

This is a perfect  basic recipe.  Where you can add what you want.  I skipped the diced tomatoes since husband hates them.  I hate spaghetti sauce so I made a white sauce and added 1 cup of spaghetti sauce to it.  It made the sauce lighter in taste.  I also browned the garlic and cooked it with the ground turkey.  I also added some Italian seasoning, salt pepper to it.  The kids love it.  I also double the recipe and put half of it in the freezer for a quick meal when it is needed.

Similar to one that I always made before this, but I usually add one packet Lipton Vegetable Soup Mix, and I had never added sugar before.  I usually use diced tomatoes with basil garlic and oregano instead of stewed tomatoes.

I didn't have ground turkey so I ended up using Italian sausage (Bob Evans).  It was really tasty but a lot like spaghetti.  I will try again with turkey but this is a good base recipe and easy and quick.

The base recipe is good, but, like the other "most helpful" reviews, it needed a little kicking up. I added green pepper, onions and mushrooms while the ground turkey was browning. I also added red chili flakes, Italian seasonings and increased the basil.

My family enjoyed this dinner SO much.  I read the reviews first and decided how I was going to tweak the recipe.  I cooked some chopped onion with the ground turkey.  I used all the ingredients in the recipe (I didn't drain the tomatoes and I used the whole can of tomato sauce) and added garlic salt, pepper and ground red pepper.   I added some frozen veggies to the pasta as it boiled.  Everything was really really good.  I will definitely make this again!

I used Italian tomatoes, truvia in place of sugar, added fresh sliced mushroom and crushed red pepper. Only used a quarter box of pasta. Salt and pepper to taste and grated parmesean cheese. My husband raved about dinner and didn't even realize it was turkey not beef:). Great basic recipe, everyone needs to adjust to their own taste! Thanks!

I agree with other reviewers that the proportion of sauce to pasta doesn't work.  I will double the tomato sauce when I make this again.  I used whole grain rotini pasta which really captures the sauce and it tasted great.  I also added a little bit of tomato paste and more spices (oregano, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste).  My two-year-old liked this so I think it is well worth tweaking to suit our own tastes.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW.....this was awesome.  I used LOTS of seasonings, because turkey is bland.  I used twice the amount of tomato sauce.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

With a few changes this is a really good comfort dish.  I sauteed an onion and a small bell pepper in EVOO then added my turkey, S&P, 3 minced garlic cloves, basil, oregano, and a little chili powder.  I also added 2 cans of tomatoe sauce rather than 1.  I used Ziti pasta (almost a whole box) and diced soft motz. cheese and stirred in.  Will make again with these changes.

This is the same goulash my mom made when I was a child.  Only differences are that she used ground beef, and instead of noodles, we used rice.  It went a long way with 4 children, dad and mom.  Still a staple in many homes.

This recipe is fine for what it is: a meat sauce for pasta using ground turkey.

It is not, however, anything like goulash.

I agree with it being a little bland - but I guess that comes with the territory when using turkey as a substitute for this. I had to add several seasonings to add taste but overall it was good. Will try again...

This was just okay. In order to make it worth a "second" try and in order to make it acceptable to feed the family it took a whole lot of doctoring. It was extremely bland, and tasteless prior to that. After adding a bunch of spices and veggies it received an "it's okay" rating from the troops. This just didn't do it for our family. I won't be making this recipe again.

OMG just delicious with a few chgs. per another reviewer, Janett, and myself.  I  cooked a small onion and a half with the garlic called for and then added 1.28 lbs. of lean ground turkey and browned it.  I then added a can of 28 oz. of diced tomatoes (which had garlic, basil and oregano added to it), 3 cups of tomato sauce, a good pinch or two of oregano, a dash of chili powder, salt, a touch more basil than called for in recipe, a sprinkle of red pepper and a good pinch of emeril's all purpose (essence..i think) spice.  By accident I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar rather than 2 teaspoons. I then simmered it on cooktop for at least 45 minutes (hubby was late) and served it over a full 16 oz. package of bow tie pasta.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.   We all loved it.

This is a super easy recipe and takes less than the 45 minutes noted.  I also use what items are in my pantry.  No stewed tomoatoes, then I use a can of Rotel.  No Tomato Sauce; ahh...there's the leftover Spaghetti Sauce in the fridge...there we go!

Quick and delicious. I didn't use ground turkey but chopped up some breast from a turkey I had baked the day before. I added extra seasonings as advised by other reviewers. Also used shell pasta because I didn't have bowtie on hand. We loved it! Thank You for sharing.

Gotta give this a 5 as it's easy, doesn't take long, economical, healthy, & most importantly tastes good consistently when I make it. As a pasta-lover, this has become a standby - one of those recipes to fall back on and make in a snap. I just make sure I have a can of sauce and diced (or stewed) tomatoes on hand & use whatever pasta I feel like (multigrain, penne..). I throw in a little extra sauce (tomato or even spaghetti sauce) if I have it. Like others, added some red pepper flakes to give extra snap.

Great recipe for replacing beef with ground turkey.  A few little changes, but stayed pretty much the same.  Cut out sugar.  Everyone loved it.

This was actually much better than I expected. I did add another can of sauce so it wasn't dry. I also added salt, pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper powder. Oh, also, insstead of 2 teaspoons of sugar, I just did two pinches. No need for extra refined sugar.

This was a decent outline of a dish.  You can of course add to it at will.  I added an onion and some fresh tomatoes as well as some paprika.  My husband is Hungarian and while this isn't 100% "real" goulash, it is a good alternative dish.  Both of our children liked it, although using bowtie pasta instead of "boring" elbow mac certainly helped with that.. lol.

This was a great meal to use up things I had in the pantry and fridge.  I used rotini noodles and added extra veggies I had on hand:  onion, mushrooms, red pepper.  I also added some chili powder and paprika as suggested in previous reviews.  When my kids saw me cooking the meal they were not very excited about it, but once they tasted it, they were very happy little campers.  I topped theirs with a bit of grated parm.

I am rating it 5 stars for the sheer simplicity of this recipe. And it is tasty! I cooked some chopepd onion with the meat, tossed in some red, yellow and green peppers with everything else (any chance to add more veggies) and used italian style stewed tomatoes. I also doubled the tomatoe sauce. My 2 yr old loved it which is a surprise in itself! Thanks for posting.

I make something very similar to this.  I would omit the sugar, who needs it!  I agree, add onion, and I also add kidney beans.  You can also use whole wheat pasta as well.

Very tasty. I followed other suggestions and added minced onion, Italian seasoning, dried basil, garlic powder, and a dash of paprika. We used quinoa elbow pasta. Very healthy and yummy.

This was soooo good!  My kids loved it too andthey are 4 and 6.  I used the barilla rotini noodles with it and used a whole can of tomato sauce instead of 1/2.  Also added oregano and season salt like others suggested.  My kids are asking me to make it again!  This will be a keeper!

Pretty decent flavor.  A little more is needed.  I used onion powder and tomato paste in place of the sauce.  I prefer my sauce a little richer.  Overall a good recipe.

This was DELICIOUS!!!  I only had whole wheat penne on hand so I took the chance and it came out wonderful!  I added the minced garlic and a ton of spices while the turkey browned and used italian stewed tomatoes like some of the reviews suggested.  This was soooooooo good and I can't wait to make it again!  I can't believe something healthy can taste this good!

Great dinner.  I used Italian seasoned ground turkey instead of plain and added onions when browning the turkey.  It came out great and not bland at all.

I give this five stars after my  alterations of what I had on hand. Used only the Tomato Sauce with 1 small can of tomato paste. Brown the turkey burger with onion, salt and ample Italian seasoning. Add sauce, paste, water--(used the paste can), 3 garlic cloves, 3tsp salt, 3T Honey, 3T basil, crushed red pepper flakes. Let that simmer on medium low. In a separate skillet, Saute 1/2T olive oil, mushrooms, green bell peppers, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper flakes over medium heat, cover until completely tender, stirring frequently. Meanwhile boil Wild Basmati Rice Mix (2 cups uncooked rice with 2 1/2 C. water) for 15 minutes. Mix sauted veggies and rice with sauce and enjoy with Parmesan cheese on top. DELICIOUS!!

This was so good.  I tweaked it a little for my family's taste.  I added more sauce or it would've been dry, added more garlic, some sauted onion, salt and pepper.

This was good for a quick-to-make dinner, and it tastes even better the next day. I also added sour cream, because it reminds me of the old 'clean your plate' or 'husband's delight' casserole, if any of you are familiar with that. Make a batch and then put in small containers to take to work for lunches.

Everyone loved this recipe including my 4-year-old.  It's great because it's yummy and healthy in it's basic form, and because you can customize it to fit your family's exact tastes.  Great home-style comfort food.

This is a great basic recipe.  I spiced it up adding 1 package of Lawry's  spaghetti sauce powder. I used 3 cups of cooked rice instead of the pasta.  I also added 1 can of corn.

Excellent!  I did make some changes...sauteed onions and green peppers prior to adding the turkey...used Garlic Garlic (by Tastefully Simple) rather than the cloves, and had to add an extra can of tomato sauce to keep it from being too dry.  I also added some crushed red pepper and a little seasoned salt and skipped the sugar. Used Barilla Plus MultiGrain elbows instead of bowtie, (only b/c I couldn't find multi-grain bowties). Served steaming hot with shredded cheddar & hot sauce on the side for people to add.  Delicious and healthy and easy, what a great combo!  Thanks!

With some sprucing up this is a 5 star recipe; I took the advice of others..added some orange pepper, fresh mushrooms, half an onion and Italian Seasoning along with the basil.  I substituted Stevia for the sugar, and used Chili Seasoning Stewed Tomatoes, stuck with the 1 cup of tomato sauce and only added 2 cups uncooked rotini noodles...this was far from bland.

Really good. If you like a lot of sauce, you might want to add a little more than the recipe calls for. Is very easy to play around with flavors/spices in this dish. Melted some cheese on top-delicious!

This was great, but I did make some changes which is why I rated it a 4 instead of a 5. I used 14 oz. tomato sauce and 13 oz whole wheat pasta. The extra sauce was definately needed. I browned my turkey with a diced onion and the garlic (garlic probably could've been reduced to 2 cloves). Added a bit more basil, some oregano, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. It turned out great and I will definately be making it again!

Pretty good recipe. Family enjoyed it. I made it as written. Will probably tweak it a bit next time I make it. I would cut back the pasta by about a third and cut the sugar in half. I may sub oregano instead of the basil or perhaps add it with.

This recipe was yummy and pretty fast. However, i did add a few things. I used flavored stewed tomatoes and extra sauce. I also added some green onion and fresh parsley. All in all it was very good my husband went back for seconds but we did have a lot of tra pasta.

This will go into my regular rotation of healthy, but delicious recipes. While the healthy eater will want to watch his portion size, the flavor of this recipe is awesome. I made the mistake of missing breakfast and ate two large helpings after working out because I was so hungry.  I added 1/2 onion, 1/2 diced green pepper, 1 teaspooon minced garlic, and 1/2 small carton of fresh mushrooms. In terms of spices, I added 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and one teaspoon red pepper flakes (if you don't like a nice kick in your sauce, leave out the red pepper flakes). I also used whole wheat pasta (penne) to make the recipe even healthier.  Finally, I added 1 can tomato soup because with my extra ingredients, I needed more liquid. This is a simple, easy to prepare, yet tasty recipe.  We love it.

This recipe reminds me of my childhood!  I also added a sprinkling of crushed red pepper, along with a little smoked paprika.  I like to put it in a casserole dish, sprinkle cheese on top and brown it lightly in the broiler prior to serving.

This was extremely easy to make - my boyfriend's son actually made it for us, with my help. Overall a good dish, but it does need a little extra flavor.  We added some hot sauce, but next time I will add some paprika and see how that does. Quick, easy and hearty though, so will make this again. Thanks!

This recipe saved me!  Had ground turkey, but not much to make it with until I came across this recipe! It's a simple recipe with room for growth, I love that you can add your own spin to it. I added green peppers and onions as well, along with chili powder and paprika Would be great with corn thrown in there, too!

For a turkey based meal it was good. Because of dietary restrictions didn't season this as I might normally but it was a nice meal and better the next day.
We will make this again.

This recipe made by itself is extremely bland. 16ounces of macaroni is way too much but even when I cut it down it was still bland and I had to put in a whole lot of spices to even get it decent.

I was a little doubtful about this one when I read the recipe..but man oh man..this one is good!!  I have made it a few times and my only adjustment is I cut back on the sugar. My husband loves this and I always have the ingredients on hand!  This one is a keeper!

This was a hit in our house as well!  As others suggested, I added some onion when I cooked the turkey.  I also used an entire can of tomato sauce, and added parsley, paprika and S/P.  My husband had thirds, my 2-year old ate everything in his plate and we still have leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Base recipe is somewhat bland; however, doctored with paprika, cayenne, a little seasoned salt, and some yellow onion sautéed with the ground turkey, it was quite tasty. Swap out the ground turkey with ground beef and I'm ten years old again, eating my Mom's goulash in our country kitchen. NOTE: I doubled the recipe but left the amount of pasta the same--if using the recipe as written, halve the pasta or the dish will be wayyyy too dry. Also, slightly undercook the pasta and let it simmer in the dish for fifteen or twenty minutes, so it absorbs some of the tasty liquid.

I can't agree with most people on this one. I followed the instructions and this dish was so bland and lacking flavor. It seemed like it needed more sauce and because of the lack of seasoning the plain ground turkey flavor was the most potent

Easy, and can go into a slow cooker, very tastey, and can freeze left overs and re-heat, by adding some v8 juice.

This is a good recipe, but it will be bland if you don't add more spices, i.e., chili pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, and Italian seasoning.  I also added sauteed onions and green peppers, and used cans of "spicy" diced tomatoes.  I seasoned my ground turkey and let sit overnight for more flavor. My family that has tasted it thus far loves it.

You have to make a few changes to the recipe in order to give it a 5 star rating.  There isn't enough sauce or too much pasta.  So I made it like the recipe said, then I doubled the tomato sauce because it looked like it was too much pasta.  Still added a 3rd can of tomato sauce and another can of Diced tomatoes.  After I did that, the dish looked amazing and tasted great!!  So I ended up using 3 cups of tomato sauce (24 ounces) and 28 ounces of Stewed diced tomatoes with seasonings of Basil, garlic and oregano.  This is a must try recipe.

My kids LOVED this!  I didn't have a lot of time to make dinner and knew I had ground turkey in the fridge.  Found this recipe on AllRecipes.com and decided to try it.  They're never crazy about ground turkey but within one bite kept telling me how much they liked dinner.  I didn't have bowtie pasta on hand so subbed in medium shells.  Will definitely add this into the rotation.

Very good!  The changes I made:  sauted onion and green pepper in a little olive oil & then added ground turkey and browned.  Doubled the amount of sugar and basil.  Added a partial can of Rotel.  I'm sure I added more garlic too :).  I thought it tasted as good or better then goulash with ground beef.

Tasty recipe, but I added 1/2 and onion and some additional seasonings including salt, pepper, parsely, and garlic salt (about 1/2 tsp each). Even with the extras its still a bit bland if you like your food with a lot of flavor. I will probably up the seasoning to 1 tsp each next time. I also subsituted elbow noodles for bow-tie.

As others have stated this recipe is great but a bit bland. I did the same as others as well and added my own spices as well as chopped onions. I think I would also add more tomato sauce next time as it didn't seem like enough to cover all the pasta it calls for. Overall this was a quick and easy recipe and very tasty too!

This was ok.  It wasn't gross, it was edible but I wouldn't make it again.  It was good to find only because I was using up what was left in my freezer and fridge before grocery shopping.  I did add some onion and some mixed veggies and some garlic and a little italian and tex mex spice for more flavor.

This was good. I added a red bell pepper to the recipe. I also used whole wheat riggatoni. It isn't the most flavorful dish, but it is healthy and I enjoyed it and will make it again. The most important thing to me is that my three year old ate it.

Pretty good.  I did alter it a bit though due to a lack of ingredients; I used macaroni noodles instead of bow-tie and other seasonings instead of basil.  I still got the overall idea though, and it was a decent, quick, easy meal.

1. It is a very simple recipe. I am a single dad and finding food that both of  my daughters enjoy is tough. They loved this!

2. The only thing I did differently was use Banza Pasta made with chickpeas. This pasta is a great alternative to you looking for gluten free non-gmo options.

I am wondering why you call the American Goulash, Goulash, does it not require Paprika, I think your recipe is a good one, but I would call it something else. I am very careful about adding green pepper to anything, it takes over the flavour and cancels out any suttle good flavour of other spices, I would never add it to this recipe, anyway, those are my thoughts.

Enjoyed this but added a chopped onion, chopped red pepper, chopped jalapeno with seeds, small can of mushrooms, sprinkles of  crushed red pepper, around 1/2 tsp of chili powder and pepper, and a teaspoon each of Italian seasoning (instead of basil),  smoked paprika and salt.  Used the whole 16 oz of bow tie pasta and everyone liked it but it had some heat to it.

I didn't add the sugar b/c Stewed Tomatoes are already pretty sweet. Also, I used a whole grain pasta instead of Bow Ties, b/c that's always what we prefer.  A lot of fresh Basil, & some Thyme, Rosemary & Garlic made a lot of difference the second time I made it.

Four stars very fast and simple to make but too bland. We love spice in my house so added two fresh jalapenos and some cayenne pepper spiced it right up. Also doubled the tomatoe sauce and stewed tomatoes. I also cut up the tomatoes smaller will used diced next time! Used mini farfalle (bow tie) noodles and only used about 2/3 the box.

We really enjoyed this and I will make this again. I drained the oil after cooking the turkey for a healthier dish. I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed so I cooked it a little longer. After it had simmered for 20 minutes it was looking too thick so I added another 14 oz of tomatoes and 1/2 cup of sauce. I cooked 16 oz of pasta but I only used 1/2 , I'll made pasta salad with the other half. After tasting it I decided to omit the sugar as it was already sweet enough. Thanks for sharing.

First of all, the ratio of pasta to sauce is way too high! Next, I cooked the ground turkey WITH the diced garlic & onion - both gave more flavor to the ground turkey.   I followed the advise of another reviewer (Janett) and only used 2/3 of a pound of whole wheat pasta.  I doubled the amount of diced tomatoes to 28 ounces (1 large can) and added mushrooms and black olives.   Even better the next day!

I added 2 tsp. each of basil and oregano, also diced onion and celery to saute with the garlic.  Added a couple of splashes of Frank's hot sauce to the mix and a dash of sweet paprika before final stir and served!  It's REALLY good!  My husband and I are trying to eat heart and body healthy, so we eat a lot of ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Love this recipe, I've made it 3 times this month!  Thank you for sharing it!

We really liked this! I always use ground turkey in lieu of beef anyway. I had to use 3/4 can of tomato soup instead of sauce and forgot the sugar.  Not missed! I always cut the pasta in half too. I don't understand how anyone can use an entire pound in any one recipe.

The only change I made was adding some black pepper -- just because I like my food a little spicy!  It would have been great without the pepper though, in case you don't like the spice.  Easy, quick, yummy recipe!!

This was quick and plenty good. Easy to individualize for taste. We added a small can of black beans, a small can of corn, used pre-seasoned diced tomatoes, and added a  bit of pesto. It was tasty and filling!

This is a good basic recipe that can be "spiced up" and suggested by the other reviewers.  I added a lot of onion and garlic, paprika and Italian spices.  A box of pasta turned out to be too much, even after increasing the amount of sauce.  I would use half, and may even try it on rice next time.

I used diced tomatoes rather than the stewed and only 12 oz. pasta which was more than enough for the amount of sauce.  Terribly bland.

We added all sorts of extras to bring up the flavor in this dish, but more sauce and spices still didn't make it any better than 2-star. The ratio of pasta - turkey - sauce is out of whack, I think. The whole dish is dry, bland, and not very goulash-y

This is a recipe I use in the winter when it's cold and rainy and I haven't been to the grocery store in awhile. It is a good basic recipe that can be adjusted to fit everyone's diet.  I don't use sugar, and prefer adding onions, garlic, or bell pepper and spices, and toss grated cheese on top.  Again, this is a good basic recipe that will please all family members.

Delicious!  I never made this before so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was really good.   I followed the recipe and suggestions from others, I used 1 lb turkey, 1 (10oz) can Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 (15oz) can  tomato sauce,  2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp basil and 8 oz bowtie noodles.  Definitely a keeper!

It was tasty and I will make it again!  Instead of basil I added cumin which is great :).  This was my first time attempting goulash and the only thing I found was it wasn't as "chili-like" as I assumed it would be.  I followed the liquid instructions exactly and when I finished it was like pasta with a meat sauce. Wondering if this has happened to anyone else? Still really good. Thanks!

Extremely dry and bland. Had to only use 12 ounces of noodles, triple the sauce, double the tomatoes, add in a TON of extra spices as well as green pepper and onion and it was much better.

I found that the sauce was somewhat watery so I added a  tomato paste. Also I added chopped onion and a dollop of relish (yes relish) to regular diced tomatoes instead of stewed.

This was a nice tasty weeknight recipe with readily available pantry items.  A good base recipe, I found it needed some tweaks on spices as other reviewers mentioned.  I added fresh basil, dried Italian seasoning, paprika, and some beef boullion powder and water/ red wine.  I also halved the amount of pasta.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Denise.

I would say 5 stars with the few changes I made; 2 cans of basil, garlic, oregano tomatoes, an onion, a green pepper,and a few spices. Therefore no leftovers!

I read a lot of the reviews on this recipe and added chopped onion and green pepper. We really liked this with that change but I think next time I will add a little more tomato sauce.

This was very tasty. I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, added salt, pepper, and paprika. I used a cup of homemade pasta sauce and cut sugar amount in half. I chose Barilla Veggie pasta. Next time I will use ground bison instead of turkey.

This was very good and easy to make. I added a chopped onion and browned with the turkey. I added about a tsp of paprika to the sauce and about a cup of Parmesan cheese. This made the sauce thicker and creamier. Used whole wheat rotini. Will be making again!!

Delish!  After reading the reviews I did add extra basil, Italian seasoning and paprika.  I also added extra tomato sauce to make sure I had enough to cover the pasta.  On that note, I did not use the full box of pasta.

Yummy and easy to make, we didn't like chunks of tomatoes in our sauce so we left them out and it was still wonderful! next time I will add more tomatoe sauce, because it was a little dry.

We've been making this for years. You do have to add to it. It is very bland without seasonings & dry. 
We add garlic, onions, green pepper (sometimes)& all kinds of seasonings when we cook the turkey, but we do double the sauce & tomatoes.

Great recipe! I took it as a starting point and then I added a few things to it. Can corn, mushrooms, onion, mozzarella & parmesan Cheese! YUM! It's now a favorite of the house! I didn't add the tomato sauce either. I didn't want it to be real runny. It's key to let it summer for 20 minutes! Very Good!

Great recipe!  I read the reviews and took others' advice.  I used italian stewed tomatoes instead of regular and added sauted onion and garlic powder (lots).  I also used sicilian seasoning instead of the basil.  My three year old asked for seconds and he is picky so I'm definitely keeping this recipe!
