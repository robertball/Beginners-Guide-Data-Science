I make Cabbage Soup for my adult family (myself, DH, 2 sons, daughter, son-in-law and Angelica on the way) fairly often and it's always a hit. This version is particularly good and even better if left to "sit" for an hour or two before serving. I would recommend chopping the celery and onion particularly thin/small and making sure that the carrots are no larger than "bite-sized." If you need to "stretch" it (as I often do), serving it over white rice works well as does adding a can or two of white or pink beans before adding the cream or milk (sometimes I omit these all together and simply throw in a large can of diced tomatoes or tomato sauce). Other great additions include green beans and mushrooms. Finally, this works very well meatless or with ground beef, turkey or chicken or smoked turkey sausage or kielbasa, too. Adaptable, economical and delicious. Who could ask for more?

a great creamy and hearty soup for a cold day. The only change I made was to add an extra cup of chicken broth and more carrots. Not because it needed more carrots, I just like carrots in my soup.

Really liked this soup!  I did make a change or two.  I only had bacon on hand so I used that.  I also somewhat burnt it - not on purpose (my husband liked the flavor of it).  I had no cream so I used evaporated milk and skim as that's what i had on hand.  No fresh parsely so I had to use dried.  I love cabbage - and loved this soup.

This is sooooooooooo good!  And I am a college student and I dont really know how to cook but it still turned out good.  I didnt think I liked cabbage.  I used bacon instead of ham because i didnt have any ham.  I used more chicken broth than two cups because, like other reviewers said, two cups is NOT enough.  It was amazing this recipe rocksssss and it makes TONS of food I had to freeze some I hope it freezes well...

Edit: It froze wonderfully and tasted like the night I made it

We REALLY loved this soup! I've had it in my recipe box forever & finally gave it a try since I had all the ingredients on hand. It's a keeper! We love cabbage & are always looking for new ways to incorporate it into our meals. This soup fits the bill, is very easy, & is delicious! I added minced garlic & used 5 strips of bacon instead of the ham. I also modified the process slightly to maximize flavor: cooked cut-up pieces of bacon in the pot, removed browned pieces to paper towel, poured out the grease leaving 1T to saute onions, celery, carrots, & minced garlic before adding broth & cabbage to simmer w/ the black pepper & thyme, then added the milk/cream mixture & the bacon back in to heat through. Aside from the bacon & garlic, I kept the other ingredient amounts as-directed & this soup tasted fabulous! Thanks for the great recipe! :)

Great way to get your veggies in. I have even cut out the cream with good results. Used evap. milk in can. Great with cauliflower and bacon bits as subs.

I had a cabbage and some ham in my fridge, so I came on this site searching for a recipe with both ingredients, and came upon this soup recipe.  I’m glad I made it.  It’s very hearty and wonderfully flavorful.  I did tweak it somewhat so I could clean out my crisper and also to reduce prep time.  In addition to all the vegetables called for, I also added a green pepper, green beans, and a can of stewed tomatoes. I had some fresh herbs on hand, so I added some sage, thyme, and oregano.   I also combined the cubed ham with the vegetables and after simmering together a while,  I found that no salt was needed.   I completely eliminated the butter and flour step because I found it unnecessary.  Instead, I slowly added the milk and low-fat half & half to the soup right before serving.  I also thickened it a bit with couple tbsp of corn starch.  My husband and I both had second servings.  Very satisfying!

2 cups of broth didn't seem adequate for the amount of veggies, and since I make my own broth and freeze it in 4 cup containers, I used that much.  Other then adding an extra tablespoon of flour and using evaporated milk I kept everything else the same.  It was a nice mild, creamy and very tasty soup.

Hubby went for 5 stars, I was going for 3, so it's gonna be 4. This is not a bad soup at all, but I think I'd like it more if the cabbage was cooked separately with 3 potatoes, then mixed together and added to the rest. I did like it, just wasn't overwhelmed.

I loved this but my husband found it to be a bit too rich and salty for him.  Will definitely be making again but will cut out the salt.

This was awsome soup! I used extra chicken broth and substituted one cup of milk instead of 2 cups of cream. We fought over the last bowl.

This soup is excellent! I am making it for the second time and followed the recipe as is except this time I used 3 cups homemade chicken broth instead of the 2 cups called for.  (I used 4-5 cups broth last time and wanted it less soupy this time).  I have it simmering on the stove until dinner time.  I did only use 1/2 the thyme as I didn't have any the first time and thought it was great and I didn't want it to be too strong of a flavor as some reviewers commented.  The flavors have blended together beautifully and I'm glad I only used 1/2 the thyme.  It came out perfect!

This is the best cabbage soup recipe ever!!! You must try this recipe, it's real easy to make and fast to cook. We substitute the ham for chicken. Our family enjoys it at least once every week. Very hearty. Enjoy!

I am such a fan of cooked cabbage that I knew I had to try this recipe.  I was so happy I did.  I LOVE THIS SOUP!!!!  The only thing I do differently is that i substitue the light cream with Simply Smart 1% milk (less calories).  I have made this twice now and am ready to make a new batch!!!  Thanks for the recipe Laurie Harms!!
***Update:  I made this in my slow cooker for the first time.  It came out fabulously.  I love using my slow cooker so that I don't have to babysit the pot.  I cooked it for 6 hours and it was tender and delicious.

Very nice soup :)  I added a cup of chicken broth after reading reviews and it was just perfect.  Also used all 2% milk instead of cream, and I only had thin ham slices so I just chopped these in squares (had about 1 and 1/2 cups) and it was very yummy.  Only used 1/2 tsp salt, too.  Oh and I used 4 small carrots since they're healthy and yummy.  Thanks for the great recipe - a very good way to use those cabbages!

I made the soup for a family from church. They spent Christmas day with us ('08) and they love cabbage. I had never used it before, but am in love with it since this soup! I add a TB of Goya Brand Adobo Hispanic All Purpose seasoning and any fresh herbs I have on hand when I make mine, but love the recipe all together! It's a HUGE hit!

Pretty good actually. I used half purple cabbage and half green cabbage and to my dismay it turned the soup purple. Oh well it got alot of attention. I didn't use cream, only milk and I can't say I would have noticed a difference (cream is so expensive). Everything else I did the same. I will make again, probably just stick with green cabbage lol. Everyone who tried it said it was goood. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  We love cabbage around here and had some leftover ham from the weekend.  It all came together so wonderfully.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It was a hit and I will be making it again very soon.

yummmmy!  I didnt have any cream and used evaporated milk as a previous reviewer mentioned.  Turned out terrific.  The only change I might make next time is using less Thyme as it was almost overpowering.

We do not KNOW HOW anyone could rate this anything but a 5 star!!!!! This soup is DYNAMIC!!! There is not one flavor that over powers. All the flavors blend together perfectly. It reminds us of a chowder. We made this with bacon instead of ham because we felt the bacon would add a better flavor and even tho we love ham the bacon we could tell was the best choice. I made a double recipe and thought "oh no. well if we have to much we can take left overs to my sisters house". Well sorry sis but we aren't going to have any left overs. We can tell it is even going to be better tomorrow and we are getting ready to be buried under snow so this is going to be OH SO WARM AND YUMMY tomorrow night! Definitely a Govostis Family traditional winter soup.

Followed the recipe to a "T" (rare for me) and it was wonderful. I can see how having a bit more broth and less cream can work as well, but I loved it as is!

My husband loved this soup. I had my doubts because I do not generally like cabbage, but I was pleasantly surprised. The flavors are not powerful or amazing- just subtle and comforting. I would suggest adding an extra cup of chicken broth and another carrot. Just my personal preference.

This was pretty tasty but I was not able to get my soup to thicken up. I guess I will try more flour next time. What a great way to use up the cabbage from the garden!

Im not sure what to rate this.  It wasnt gross but  it was a taste I did not prefer.  4 stars is fare.  The cabbage flavor was quite strong, so if you like cabbage then this is quite good.  I do like cabbage but this was too much for me.  I added extra water to my soup because the 2 cups broth simmered away.  I aslo added cheddar cheese which gave it a richer taste for me.

Excellent.  The only change we made was that we used kielbasa instead of the ham and added another carrot.  Yummy!

I rarely write a bad review, because I really hate to.  And it is especially difficult when there are so many other fantasic reviews out there.  But we really did not like this soup.  I love creamed cabbage and I love most creamed soups.  We should have loved this.   Perhaps our cabbage head was particularly strong or something, but this just did not taste good.  Sorry.

Creamy soups are a comfort food for me and our food boxes have been liquidating an apparent bumper crop of cabbage this year. Well, long story short, I've never been a fan of cabbage but I gotta tell ya this soup blew my socks off! DEELICIOUS! I did make some modifications: I used 2 cans chicken broth plus 2 Tbsp. chicken soup base and 2 C. water; about 1 C. shredded carrot; 1/2 C. crumbled bacon instead of the ham; 1 tsp. dried garlic flakes, 1/2 Tbsp. Beau Monde and 1/8 tsp. mace or nutmeg. Oh, and I added a can of canellini beans. It was superb.  Thank you.

This recipe was wonderful.  My husband said I could make it and sell it and people would come from all over to taste this unique and delicious soup.  Even my 3 and 4 yr old children cleaned their plates.  We didn't have cream in the house, or half and half so I simply used all milk.  The cream would have taken this recipe over the top!  We had kept our broth from the ham and I used that instead of chicken broth.  What a cozy, tasty meal!

I made an absolute pig of myself after making this soup - it's that good!  I used fat-free half & half, but when I make it for my Christmas Eve buffet I think I'll use the light cream just for kicks.
I'm sure I'll be passing out the recipe before the night is over.

This was average to good. It is very rich with all the half and half in it. You don't want to eat a large bowl. Doesn't have a lot of eye appeal. That being said, both the husband and the son really liked it when I got them to try. A good basic recipe for cabbage lovers.

Wow this is great, even my DH who does not like cabbage or Ham asked for a 2nd helping !! This will be one of my favorites for this winter. I made it heartier with 3 carrots and a good sized head of cabbage added extra cup of broth, and subed evaporated milk for the cream. One other thing I sautaed the onion in a little olive Oil before adding the broth (this is how I start all my chowders). My daughter turned me on to this recipe and am so glad she did.
