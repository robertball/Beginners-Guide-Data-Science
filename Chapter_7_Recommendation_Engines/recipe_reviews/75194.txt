This one has all the right moves.  For more calories and the "good kind" of fat, add sliced avocado or hummus!

Awesome! This was perfect for a quick and healthy lunch! I LOVE tomatoes from the garden and this was a great way to use them up. I lightly toasted my bagel first and added a little kosher salt to my tomatoes along with a bit of cracked black pepper. I mixed the mustard with a bit of light mayo to make it smooth and creamy. I left out the sprouts and instead opted for a sprinkling of light feta cheese. No matter what you do with this your belly is in for a real treat!

This is definitely healthy! To keep me going all afternoon it needs a little fat and protein, so I like to cut the veggies roughly, mix in a tablespoon of grated cheddar and add some fat-free salad dressing (ranch or thousand island). It's like a salad on a bagel and I'm not hungry as soon this way.

This became part of a "bring your own" taste-test lunch.  One person choice was a pita bread, which is, nutritionally, a healthier choice.  Ole, either way!

Yumm!!! Used a toasted whole grain bagle. Left out the sprouts, and added mayo and cheddar. Sometime I add a slice of ham. It's great without though too :)

Absolutely delicious and easily customizable. We make these at work by each bringing in different ingredients and forming a bagel buffet line! Thanks.

This is so easy to make, and it tastes so fresh! I don't eat red meat, so this is a nice change from the sandwiches I normally stick to.

Very good and similar to a sandwich I make.  I just add a thin layer of sweet and sour on top of the mustard.. SO good!

Simple but great. I left out the sprouts and added mayo and cheddar, and I used an egg bagel. Add whatever you like, leave out what ever you don't!

So good. I love cucumbers on sandwiches. Added some whipped cream cheese along with a thin spread of mustard. I used to order a veggie sandwich at panera that had banana peppers on it, so I added those as well & didn't have sprouts or green pepper. Fantastic!

This is a good sandwich.  There are lots of people giving this a low rating because it doesn't have meat or cheese on it.  That's because it's a "veggie" sandwich.  And as soon as you add protein or fat to a carb, the carb makes your body absorb the fat.  The reason why there is no mayo and no cheese and no meat is so that the sandwich IS healthy.  You can eat ten of these for lunch and not gain weight as long as you keep your carbs separate from your protein and fat.  Carbs and veggies are great together.  Protein, fat and veggies together is great...just don't add carbs to it.  Eat fruit by itself.  Eliminate added sugar.  
Ever get a stomach ache or bloating, think about what you just ate.
It's all how you combine your food.  Trust me, your stomach will thank you.  :-)

I made this for lunch today and it was very good. I rated it a 4 because I did feel it needed just a little bit extra. I added crumbled feta and fresh cracked pepper on mine as well. I used everything fresh from the garden. (which of course, always makes everything better!)

These were really tasty.  I used wholemeal bagels, omitted the onion. and added beetroot.  Veggies were so tasty didn't bother with the salt and pepper.  Quick light meal when you need to boost your veggie intake for the day.

This is a great started idea, but it definitely needs a bit of something more. I added some hummus and a bit of olive oil and vinegar to the lettuce (with pepper)...I ommitted the onion and I was satisfied with this end result. Use whole wheat bagels and this is a high fiber, low-fat vegan sandwich that everyone can appreciate if they want a light, tasty meal that's quick to make.

I made this using a toasted everything bagel and added a slice of cheddar cheese. Instead of mustard I whipped up a batch of "Extra Easy Hummus" (from this site) and it was a TOTAL hit! My husband said he could eat it every day! Thanks so much for a healthy and easy recipe!!!

There was a drugstore in Manhattan that made a sandwich like this except they used cream cheese instead of mustard.  I had one most days until they finally retired and closed the drugstore.  Makes a very refreshing sandwich and really perks you up with the fresh veggie flavors.

A delicious and healthy sandwich! I used whole wheat bagel thins and didn't have sprouts so I had t leave them out.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results. The great thing about this recipe is how adaptable it is.  I could use all sorts of different veggies and add different types of cheeses for variation.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This is my favorite sandwich! I'm trying to lose weight right now so I've substituted the bagel for one of those 100 calorie, high fiber English muffins.  Sometimes I used the mustard. Sometimes I spread with a cream cheese mixture of 4 oz. of cream cheese mixed with about 4 or 5 chopped green onions! Major yum!

What a great sandwich!!  Made these yesterday for lunch using multi grain bagels lightly toasted, garden fresh tomatoes, yellow peppers, and cucumbers.    The garden fresh veggies made this over the top.  Thank you Annie for sharing a quick and delicious lunch.

This recipe was delicious! I just had this for dinner. I added pesto instead of mustard and also added avocado.

Yummy!!  Loved it!! I did make a couple of changes mostly because of neccessity. I used a thin bagel, added garlic and onions, switched the lettuce for spinach, used horseradish mustard, and didn't add alfalfa sprouts(had none). I will definitely be making this again and again!!!! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great tasting healthy sandwich!  I like to change up what veggies I pile on to keep it interesting....summer squash and red pepper are my faves!

My husband and I loved these fresh sandwiches! We used reduced fat cream cheese, added chives and garlic and spread a thin layer on each side of the bagel instead of the mustard.  Will have again!

My only tip is that when making it to add an extra healthy factor is to lay off the mustard and substitute it with Toffurki ( a gluten free, lactose free, all natural, amazing ) cream cheese or hummus. The best way to stay healthy is to add more veggies! I have experimented with many different recipes and all you have to do is make it your ow. You could also use a whole grain bagel. The recipe was great, but above were just a few more things I added to make it even healthier.

as was pointed out by another reader, bagels are VERY carb rich!!  1/2 a bagel is adequate for most people, and for sure if you are diabetic.  Therefore, I do not agree it is as healthy a choice as most think!  Certainly better than meat and cheese laden bagels, but maybe bagels are not the best choice, unless as mentioned, you have 1/2 an open faced sandwich.

I have this all the time- Use bagel thins (toasted), sandwich thins or 'fold its'  as well- lower calories and a good crunch.  Hummus makes a good addition.

This was really a great sandwich.  I was a little hesitant because it didn't have any meat, but the combination of veggies with the bagel really works.  I also used a mixture of mayo and the course brown mustard, which I felt gave a better flavor.

Easy sandwich idea. I usually add cream cheese or my homemade guacamole (has cream cheese in it), omit the bell peppers, and add feta to the ingredients. Quick sandwich that can be adapted to anybody's tastes pretty easily.

Easy, fresh, and delicious! I bought whole grain wheat pitas instead of bagels, and it tasted awesome. I also used course-grain chipotle mustard instead of brown mustard. I did not use bell peppers as I'm not very fond of them. The chipotle mustard gave it a nice kick and it was very satisfying =) This is definitely going to become my staple lunch to bring with me to work!

I love how versatile and easy you can change this up but the sprouts are definitely the key ingredient here.

 My personal options are nixing the mustard and adding hummus instead, I use an everything bagel sandwich thin to cut back on the amount of bread, and adding a slice of provolone.. this sounds weird but I always add sriracha when making mine. Everyone in the house loves these.

I did make a change; eliminated the salt altogether.  681 mg of sodium is too much.  I've made this a few times, and used avocado in place of the sprouts sometimes.  It is a pretty good/healthy sandwich.
