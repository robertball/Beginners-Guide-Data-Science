This dish was amazing. at first i was somewhat worried becuase i dont like the taste of tequilla, but once the chicken is grilled the flav. is so good even on its own, then adding the grilled pinapple and sauce, well that put it over the top, sweet yet tangy all in one bite, oh so good. we will definatly be making this one again.

I made skewers instead of the method suggested here. I also added some coconut oil to the marinade and used curry paste instead of cayenne pepper. When finished I served it with some avocado. FABOULOUS!!! I suggest this recipe for a nice tropical treat.

This is a great recipe. For such a quick and easy prep, the flavor layers are delicious and complex. My husband loved it, and he thinks most chicken recipes are boring. I substituted a sweet white wine for the tequila in the marinade, and omitted the brown sugar. Next time I might add a little cumin to the marinade. Sauce was a snap in the food processor. It would be good on many other dishes, including vegetables. Kids loved it, too.

This was ok. Not something that I will make a lot. I will give it one more shot. I marinated the chicken for about 30 min. but it seemed a little strong. Think I may try adding soem pinapple juice to it next time to sweeten it up a bit.

I was very surprised with the taste of this recipe. At first I tasted the sauce without the chicken and didn't like it. Then I put a teaspoonful on the chicken just to try it. WOW! Really good! We modified it and used Corona beer instead, but it was REALLY REALLY good. Chicken was so moist and full of flavor. We will definitely try this recipe when we have friends and family over!

I really liked this recipe.  It had a very unique flavor but very tasty.  My husband even liked it and he never likes anything out of the ordinary.  I replaced the tequila with riesling wine and used stevia in stead of the brown sugar.  I also bought a whole coconut and used the milk in that for the sauce, and also added some shredded coconut to the sauce. yum! I served with rosemary garlic couscous and some steamed zucchini & yellow squash.  It was delish!

This chicken recipe was easy and tasted delicious. I ended up adding some sliced avocado on top with the pineapple and this made it taste even better. I also used canned chunked pineapple since did not have fresh.

At first I had my doubts and tasted the chicken before the Coconut mix was ready-well I was proved wrong when it was put together the way it should be and it was even better the next day- next time I would cut the coconut/sour cream mix in half because we had alot left over but now if I had some tequila shrimp to try it with........next time!
Will make again but hubby suggested in the form of kabobs

I thought this was a great recipe. The pineapple is the key player in the mix. I'm not sure if I just couldn't taste it, but I had to add extra coconut milk. The mixture just tasted like lime-flavored sour cream without it. Otherwise it was excellent, and my company loved it!

My Family did not like this recipe at all. The flavor of the chicken was not good, and the sauce to put on top had way too much lime flavor.

Yum!! Just what I was looking for.  I used lemon juice instead of lime juice- personal preference.  And added 2 crushed garlic cloves to the marinade- again, personal preference.I served it with coconut rice.  the sauce is AWESOME!  I had some left over and wat trying to think up ways to use it!!!  Daughter loved it too.

This makes way too much sauce. I used 8 oz. sour cream and used 3/4 can of coconut milk in order that we taste the coconut over the sour cream. Still could have cut the sour cream and coconut milk in half cuz way too much sauce. I only had 1 cup of tequila on hand so used 1 cup of water and the marinade still worked. I drizzled olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder over chicken right before grilling. The whole family loved the recipe. Thanks!

My dad and I loved this.  My only suggestion is to put more lime into the marinade.  The sauce was amazing and I will be using this for a lot of different chicken dishes :)

I made this once, exactly as described and was not happy with the results.  I did have some hope for the sauce so I tried it again and made some adjustments.  I used grilled shrimp instead of the chicken, and they did grab the tequila marinade better than the chicken.  But for the sauce I used 8 oz. of sour cream, since the 16 oz. is too much.  I then doubled the lime juice, coconut milk, garlic and cilantro.  It was better, but stil on the bland side.  I don't plan on making this recipe again, but I do think that the base of that sour cream/coconut milk sauce could have potential and I plan to work on tweaking that.  I will say that the sour cream sauce was very good on the grilled pineapple since the sweet and sour mixed together nicely.  But the sauce itself is too bland to add to much of anything else.

We loved this recipe!  I served over couscous and my kids liked the sauce so well they were fighting over the last of the couscous to eat with more sauce.  The Chicken was great, very tender and flavorful.  Definitely adding to our regulars, thanks.

Not the greatest. With some of your own tweaking it could be better. I did not follow it exactly (marinade was with beer), but it was the white sauce that was most disappointing. I even added more coconut milk and it was just ok.

This was very good.  My husband said it was better than any chicken he had in a restaurant.  I followed the receipt as written and it turned out very good.  Thanks Mommy Epstein

My boyfriend absolutely destroyed this dish! We loved the sweet and sour combination. I cut the sour cream in half as others suggested, and I would cut it even further just to allow a tiny bit more of the coconut flavor to peek through. Excellent dish!!

This is so good.  I marinated the chicken for four hours instead of one hour and the flavor was throughout the chicken breast.  I used fresh lime juice, which made a difference but is a little labor intensive.  The sauce on top is tangy and great (I used low fat c. milk and sour cream)!  I used fresh pineapple with no flavoring on it, but might shake some cayenne pepper on it next time.  Great summer dish or good to get you thinking about summer in the cold/rainy weather!

I used less than the full amount of tequila and felt like it was still too much. I would recommend using less or putting more chicken in the marinade.
I used the lower fat sour cream and the light coconut milk I had on hand. Bad idea. It made a very watery product so I would stick to the regular full fat items. I think this part if the recipe could be halved or left as is when cooking a double batch as I had a lot of leftovers. 
I enjoyed the flavour of this dish which is amazing considering I detest tequila.

I made it exactly as the recipe directed. I bought canned coconut milk. I couldn't taste it at all in the sauce,  which was disappointing.  Chicken was juicy and flavorful. Just would have liked more coconut flavor. Would make again but add more coconut.

This wasn't a hit at all with us, it just felt like there was way too many flavors going on at once, and not complementing each other in a good way. Separately, the components were pretty good but together, it was just way way too much. Thanks anyway!
