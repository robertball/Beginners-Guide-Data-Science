This quick, easy recipe has a nice tang to it, though i would add a little less berries to have a less overwhelming tart flavore. Use in season black and straw berries for maximum awe flavor and sweetness. Good for beginning dessert makers or quick party pleasers. two thumbs up!

Since I am gluten free I used GF shortbread cookies in place of graham crackers for the crust and it was delicious!

Followed the recipe and it wasnt set after 12 hours, had to put it in the freezer. Started melting after about 5 minutes of being out, but the flavour was excellent.

The only springform pan I have is 10.5 inches, so I adjusted the quantities. Came out light and delicious!

Amazing. You could probably get the quantities of the ingredients wrong, or use real whipped cream or Dream Whip, etc, and no matter what you do, it's going to be good.
