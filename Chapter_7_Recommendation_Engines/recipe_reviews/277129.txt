Delicious! FYI that it was a little peppery for one of my kids (not for me, though), so if you are serving this to little ones you might want to reduce the pepper. I also think it would be a great keto meal if served with spaghetti squash or zucchini noodles.

Amazing!! Made it tonight and everyone in my house loved it! I used less pepper per the suggestions. Just seasoned to taste. We did decide next time I would add peas though. Phenomenal!!!

It was a delicious recipe. I changed up the seasonings a small bit simply by adding Italian seasonings. Will reccomend it and definitely make it again!

I made this recipe, with just a couple of time savers thrown in. Instead of chicken, I used cooked frozen shrimp (could also use Perdue Short  Cuts), and instead of cooking bacon, I used Oscar Meyer Real Bacon Bits. Tasted great! My family loved it!

This was so good. Very rich and tasty. Perfect for a cold New England night. One of the other reviewers was right, way too much black pepper called for. I basically just eye balled it. But everything else was 100% spot on. My family described it as “restaurant quality”.  Thanks for an awesome recipe. A definite keeper.
