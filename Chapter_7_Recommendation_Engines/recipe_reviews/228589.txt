this needed additional ingredients. I Added some crushed pineapple, diced green pepper, onion and some chopped fresh mushrooms, plus some brown sugar & Worcestershire sauce to cut the 'tart' taste of the French dressing... it was an OK Recipe.

I had to doctor this one. I used 2/3 less of the dressings, and added a few Tbs grape jelly, a couple Tbs honey...Some Worcestershire sauce... Patience and love lol. The flavor was still a bit odd, but my kids liked it.
