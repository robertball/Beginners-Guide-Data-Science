I have made this for many years, but using 
1/2 cup brandy and no vanilla.  After the peaches have really softened, take them out, leaving the juices in the pan. Reduce the sauce till it is nice and thick, then put the peaches back into the sauce and stir gently.  If you make larger batches, you can freeze some in small containers for later. Great served very warm over vanilla ice cream.  YUM!

Fast, easy, and delicious!  However, none of us could taste the whisky flavor  (which was what caught our eye in the first place!).  Next time I'd add half the whisky, cook for 20 minutes, then add the remaining half just before taking it off the heat.  Or, add the whole amount at once but with only 5 minutes or so left to cook.  I think that'd leave more of the tipsy flavor - yum yum!  I would definately make this again.  You could also easily make variations with different fruits.

I served the tipsy peaches as a side to baked pork chops and thought it was DELICIOUS!  I used homegrown white peaches, added a touch more brown sugar and a little more whisky. Will definitely use this recipe again.

What a great recipe!  I substituted Malibu Coconut Rum (my favorite) for the whiskey and they were absolutely great!  I'll definitely be making these again!

I didn't measure the peaches, just sliced 4 peaches, used spiced rum instead of the whiskey and my family loved this!  It reminded me of a really good peach cobbler with out the crust!  I've made it twice now.  We used a dab of whipped cream on top the first time, and a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on top for the the second go round.  Both were great!

I subbed brandy for whiskey as I prefer the flavor. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was wonderful; a great use for the bag of peaches I just purchased.

Used peeled nectarines (not peaches), and served with FF vanilla frozen yogurt. This really is crazy good, but I thought the fruit got a little too soft.  Next time (you bet there'll be a next time), I'll remove the peaches sooner because they simply don't need 30 minutes in the skillet.  This would be a nice topping for Greek vanilla yogurt or on a slice of pound cake.  Or a nice topping for grilled boneless/skinless chicken breast.  This sauce would complement soooooo many things.

I did not like this very much. I served this over ice cream and to me the whiskey taste overpowered the peach taste. My husband liked this dish, so if I make this again, I will use some other kind of liquor - maybe some flavored rum.

These were very good but I recommend adding more liquor.  I did about 1/2 cup combo whiskey and peach schnopps.

delicious!  i've been trying to find creative ways to use the yield from our very prolific peach tree, and this is a great way to do it.  i think the vanilla is a necessary ingredient if using whisky; it balances the flavour nicely.  cook times seem to be a bit long; not wanting completely mushy peaches, i've cut the times given in about half.  the sauce turns dark and thick at low-medium heat in much less than 20 minutes.

Wonderful and simple recipe! I used 2 oz of Jack Daniels instead of 1.5 and also a pinch of cinnamon.  Served with Vanilla Ice Cream and it was great! Might add sliced toasted almonds next time for something special and crunchy!

Wonderful recipe!  We love fresh peaches.  I add a little lemon juice, skip the vanilla, and add a cinnamon stick when simmering.  For fun try putting a couple of jiggers of Grand Marnier over the top and lighting on fire!  Peaches flambe!

We had a plethora of peaches on our tree, so I needed to find a good way to use them up. I doubled the butter, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. and used spice rum instead of whiskey.  I removed the peaches before adding the brown sugar, vanilla and whiskey to let the mixture cook down a little, then I realized that the peaches really needed to become part of the syrup.  I put the peaches back in and let everything cook for another ten minutes.  The result was great. I served this with ice cream. My husband and I finished the whole batch in one sitting.

Since it was a cold fall night I made a few changes for the season.  I used Frangelico for the liquor then when serving, sprinkled crumbled gingerbread cookies and almonds over the top of the ice cream and peaches.

Divine!  I used Sothern Comfort, jarred peaches in grape juice from Trader Joe's and Haagen Dazs low fat vanilla frozen yogurt, and it tasted like a dessert from a restaurant.  My guests loved it, too.

My husband could not stop raving about this dish. We didn't have any ice cream, so we just ate the Tipsy peaches. My daughter wanted to turn her nose up at them, but ate all of hers and wanted mine too! Wonderful! I'm going to try it with Brandy next time, as I think peaches and Brandy will go well together. Also, I'm going to try the same recipe with other tree fruit, such as apples, pears and maybe even plums. Yum!

These came out perfect!  I used a half cup of the whisky and did as others suggested and removed the peaches while the whisky simmered.  The peaches get soft quickly so very ripe peaches might turn to mush, use a firm peach.  Great for guests, looked and tasted beautiful.

I used rum instead of whiskey, and only cooked them for about half the recommended time. They were great as a topping for buttermilk pancakes.

Made exactly as recipe stated using Seagram's 7 because that's what we had on hand.  I used peaches that weren't quite ripe for eating, and they were perfect for the cook time the recipe called for. We served it with vanilla frozen yogurt and it was delicious!  The only thing I think I would change is trying different whiskeys/liquors.  Would love to try with french toast as another poster did.

Good tasting.  Cook time way too long.  Peaches were really juicy as fresh off tree.  Had to thicken with corn starch.  Like suggestion to remove peaches and let liquid reduce.

Everyone loved this recipe!!!  It was a crowd favorite and everyone loved the idea!  I used a sweeter whiskey (Crown or even Southern Comfort would work) and at the end I even added a little wine just to cut the sweet a little.  For garnish I whipped cream up with raspberries and a 1/2 tsp splenda for color and flavor.  The cream turned out pink and had just the right amount of sweetness.  I will definately make this again!

Very tasty!  I would do like it seems most others are doing and increase the whiskey and omit the vanilla.

Instead of the typical "bowl of icecream" for dessert, I wanted to try something different. We had some fresh peaches on hand,so I decided to try this recipe. What a wonderful dessert! However, the only thing that I would change is to add more whiskey. My family is already wanting me to make this dessert again!

The whole family really enjoyed this recipe. We didn't have whiskey so I used Malibu Rum instead. Delicious!

I made this for guests and we all agreed that it tasted like canned peaches that you could get at the grocery store. It has no punch and I agree with other reviewers that it needs more whiskey

Made as directed using Christian brothers brandy. Served on angel food cake with vanilla ice cream . I would love to try this with pork chops and with French toast as other posters did. Easy and will use again . We loved it!

Absolutely delicious!  Easy to prepare my guest loved it.  With the peach season around the corner I will certainly do it again.

AWESOME!! I served this tonight at a Memorial Day dinner and it was a huge hit! I did not have fresh peaches, so I used frozen sliced peaches.  It still came out really well and cut down on the cooking time too. I cooked the sauce only until it started thickening, then added the half thawed peaches and stirred it all together until the peaches were heated through... about 15 minutes. They were still firm enough to cut with a fork.  I think the whiskey adds a nice, nutty flavor, and we couldn't taste the liquor at all after the alcohol was cooked away. My husband said this is definitely a "keeper."

YUM!!! I had a few peaches that were not quite ripe enough to eat as is, so I sliced them, sauteed them in the butter until brown, added the brown sugar, vanilla, and I substituted spiced rum for the whiskey, and simmered for about 5 or 10 minutes. Served over vanilla ice cream. Delicious!!! Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is so easy that I'm pretty sure I could eyeball everything next go around. I absolutely love this simple and delicious recipe. My only modifications were adding more brown sugar and a big pinch of cinnamon. 

P.S. Using Jack Daniels reeeally makes it yumm-O!

I served this to our guests and we all agreed the peaches are yummy.  I used 1/2 cup bourbon as had been suggested by another reviewer...may try the whiskey next time.

This is incredible.  I put it on some shortcakes topped with whipped cream and crushed gingersnaps.  Definitely a keeper.  I did use frozen peaches so I added them after the first ten minutes of simmering.
