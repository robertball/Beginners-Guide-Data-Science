Good concept, but the marinade did not really stay with the corn through grilling.  There was only a light flavor, overall not worth the work to prepare.

I left this to marinate overnight and it was really bad.  I don't know if I did something wrong but when I put it on the grill it just got really hard.  Maybe the corn was bad.

For all the trouble it's worth, it really doesn't do much. I was disappointed by this recipe.

I must admit this recipe made my corn tastier than usual (usual meaning I don't marinate it) but there was no sweet coconut milk flavor to it so I was a bit disappointed with that.

To the person that said the corn was hard I think it was the corn or maybe you didn't cook long enough. We cook it longer than 15 min.
