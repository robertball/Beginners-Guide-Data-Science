Very Simple if you are looking for a fast dip, I even used bacon bits instead of messing with the bacon to make the process more speedier, we all really enjoyed.  Dip can be made the night before, regrigerate and bake the next day, serves alot!

Really good! the only thing I will do different is to add garlic and salt next tim. All of my guests agreed that it was delicious but could use more seasoning. Overall it eas a hit.

This was exactly what it advertised-- a quick and easy recipe for a creamy artichoke dip. Nothing spectacular, but if you are going for fast, frugal, and easy easy easy-- this is your dip. Perfect for what I wanted: football food for the game. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time i will try to fill the need for something zippy by adding some chipoltle, jalepeno, or other spicy pepper-- or maybe some cayanne. It was rich and filling, but a little boring and "premade" tasting because of the lack of seasoning or fresh ingredients. Thumbs up for ease of prep though.

Good.  I added some seasoning--garlic powder, seasoned salt--and am glad I did.  I agree it would be a tad bland otherwise.  I didn't make a full batch of this--made about half, and it is good.  It would probably be awesome heated.  As is, this is a great dip with crackers and veggies.  Thanks for the recipe.
