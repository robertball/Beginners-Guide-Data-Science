A very tasty, flavorful recipe. I love the addition of the cumin and fennel seeds (yes, they are pricey, but they are a must in the dish. Ground cumin will not work. And, you'll probably find yourself adding the seeds into other dishes. They create a nice zip to salads.) I usually add 1/2 lb of ground beef to make it a heartier meal especially during the cold winter months or if I am too lazy to make rice, but the vegetarian version is also nice. I think turnips are an underused vegetable and this recipe uses them to maximum advantage. I like how the turnips start to absorb the tomato mixture flavor. My only problem is that I usually have some water leftover in the pot. The liquid doesn't create a real sauce, so I usually drain the mixture before serving. Overall, great dish. It won't appeal to all taste buds, but we certainly enjoy it.

First I omitted the salt and the oil due to dietary restrictions. I used a bit of water in place of the oil. I added a couple grinds of fresh melenge pepper in place of the salt. I also used regular garam masala because I didn't have any Kashmiri garam masala and added it in the last few minutes of cooking.  It was wonderful with the changes and would prob be wonderful with no changes.  It is extremely flavorful and the blend of spices is perfect.  You won't miss salt at all in this dish if you choose to omit it.  It has the sweet savory taste of a good Indian dish with the turnips adding a nice sweetness to the dish.  No one will know they are turnips unless you tell them.  I was asked what they were because they were 'so good'.   I served on a bed of Saffron rice.  It was a perfect compliment to this. I would suggest a bed of rice to accompany this dish.  Use your favorite.

Great recipe!  I had no idea what to do with my turnips from my weekly bag of CSA veggies, but I love Indian (and similar) food, so I tried this recipe. I'm glad I did!  The recipe was easy, took about 20 minutes start to finish, and the flavor was wonderful.  I agree that the fennel seeds are crucial to the flavor.  I normally don't like turnips, but the spices covered (or mellowed?) the sharpness/bitterness of the turnips, and I scarfed them down with no problem (as did the kids, who just said that the "potatoes" were a little weird)!  The sauce is a little watery, but we served it over rice, and the rice soaked up a lot of the juice.

This is an awesome, delicious dish - don't let the unconventional main ingredients turn you off. Nobody I served this to guessed that it had turnips, and it looked beautiful with all the colors.

Great introduction to CSA turnips! Thank you, Allrecipes :) The sauce is easy and definitely useful for other foods as well - tempeh, chicken, or shrimp with bell pepper would be nice - but it was so fun to make something that sounded wierd and tasted so good!.  I did drain off most of the turnip cooking liquid after reading other reviews, so the sauce was just right to go over basmati rice.

This was SO tasty.  It is a perfect blend of flavors like none other!  Reading other reviews, I let the steam evaporate almost all of the liquid but hub (not knowing that I did that on purpose) said it would be better if it had more liquid to go over the rice.  I used 1 c. stewed tomatoes as I didn't have fresh.  Next time, I'll try using the whole can.  This was just wonderful.  It was a blend of spices that we don't use often enough so it had a very unique, fantastic flavor to us.  A true keeper.  Thanks!

Very very tasty.  Easy to make, turnips were really delicious.  Was looking for a recipe that utilized them as I had some from my CSA.  You can serve with a starch or not, very good.

The flavor is unique and delicious.  This recipe provides a nice change of pace, and we will definitely make it again and again.  We might try adding some carrots or some lamb, as the base seems infinitely adaptable.

i've made many different curries before, and this, flavor-wise is one of the best. instead of salt, i added 2 chopped anchovies for a little more savoriness. 

i also used the turnip greens (chopped) and carrots (grated), throwing them in after the diced turnips had steamed for 3 minutes.

LOVE. delicious.

I didn't have Kashmiri garam masala on hand, never even heard of it, perhaps it was the one ingredient that would have made it a 5 star recipe for me.  All the spices and textures came together quite well.  If we keep eating like this, I'll have to change my screen name to to 4mynotsochubbyhubby!  Very good eatin'. I will make this recipe again.

I loved this! This was my first turnip recipe, and now I'm hooked. I've made this four or five times, first as written and then with variations. Today I made a double recipe with 2 turnips, 4 carrots, a large potato, and 1 can of kidney beans. Because my tomatoes were very juicy, I drained off some of the cooking water (from the turnips) before combining. At any rate, this has been a 5 star recipe every time I've made it. I do think I like it better with carrots than without, but it is fabulous either way.  Even my 2-year-old devours this.

Excellent! Used smoked paprika in place of paprika. Probably not traditional, but tasted great. Also used anasazi beans with a little asafetida instead of the kidney beans.

I have lots of turnips coming out of my garden right now and I had to find different ways to fix them. I came across this recipe by searching this site for "turnips".  This was my first attempt at an Indian dish and I am very pleased with the results. If you like to have all your ingredients prepared ahead of time, you should add a little extra time for that.

Very good! Even the the spices with the tomatoes and onion are great by itself over bulgur or couscous. I left out the Garam marsala as I didn't have any on hand. But I increased the spices and added a bit of red pepper to add some spiceeness.

Yummy!  I had to stop myself from having a third helping of this!  I didn't change anything.  I love the turnips.  It's easy, and healthy too.  The cumin seeds were definitely worth the purchase.  I will be making this again.  Thank you.

Absolutely delicious!  Typical Indian recipe, full of flavor. I modified the recipe by using Great Northern beans instead of kidney (personal preference) and I chopped up the turnip greens and tossed them in with the onion.  Beautiful colors when it was all done, plus the nutrients of the greens . . .  . Will surely make again.  Great vegan recipe.

This was very good. I have to admit that, although I love Indian food, I don't make it often. I didn't have all of the spices. I didn't have fennel or garam masala. I made garam masala but I didn't have cardamom so it was not perfect but it was good. I think next time I would add a little more fresh ginger.

This is tasty, but not wonderful. Easy to make, flavourful, good way to eat turnips but I doubt it will become a staple in my house.

I had some turnips from the CSA, and this was a great way to use them up. This was perfectly seasoned (except I added more salt) and fairly easy to prepare. I used chickpeas, all fresh ginger, and coconut oil--delish!

I followed the recipe as it's written. I used Garam-Masala, but it was not the Kashmiri......don't even know where I would find that locally. Anyway, I'm disappointed in this dish. I do not like the flavors in this at all. Won't make it again.

My daughter and I made this for dinner and loved it.  No one missed the meat!  I did increase the seasonings a little.   I didn't have fennel seeds this time but I intend to get them and try it again. I will also use vegetable broth instead of water and increase the seasonings a little more for more flavor but we didn't consider it bland.  It was quick and easy to make and very satisfying.

The recipe calls for 2 turnips, but there is such a variety in size, I wonder if ha had too much turnip?  It was about 6" in diameter before I cut it up.  Therefore not as may beans per serving. How many cups of cubed turnip would be the right amount? I boiled it in enough water to cover them, and drained them when they were cooked.. It took almost a half hour for the turnip to be soft enough to eat.

  Didn't have Cumin seeds or masala, so I put chutney on top for a nice finish.  Low calorie, and vegan, would be good without oil or salt as well. I will make it again!

easy and delicious. I had to use normal garam masala as I did not have Kashmiri style, but worked fine.

Very good recipe. Had some turnips to use and love Indian food. Can't really taste the turnips at all, which was the kind of recipe I wanted. Based on other reviews, I drained the turnips and beans and found the end result to be the perfect texture (thicker and chunkier). Also added cayenne for some zip. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Served over fragrant basmati rice with some cilantro for garnish. I'd make this again.

We have four sons (ages 8, 6, 4, and 18 months) and they all love this dish! They don't usually like kidney beans, tomatoes or turnips on their own, but they gobbled this down no problem and asked for more. It's a great addition to a Meatless Monday rotation!

Loved it.  I agree with the reviewer who added anchovy to the dish.  I used anchovy paste (less messy) I tasted the dish and felt it was missing something so I added lemon juice and  fresh coriander chopped right before serving.  Perfection.

Really enjoyed this dish! We received turnips in our CSA basket, and husband was reluctant to eat them, so I looked for a recipe that would spice up turnips. This was great & we will certainly repeat! I did sub canned tomatoes in the recipe, because I didn't have any fresh.
