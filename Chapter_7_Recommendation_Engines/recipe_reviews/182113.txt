Very tasty and pretty easy to make. I suggest using a bit more onion, tomato, and green onion, maybe double the recipe. I liked the addition of the bread, might even add a bit more next time.

I made for a themed dinner party and these turned out pretty good for a change. I am not sure I would make these for every day dinner though.

Nicely seasoned and very simple to make this dish. Leftovers were good also. I used a mild italian pork sausage so there was lots of meat to go around. I am not sure though what the purpose of the bread was in this dish since it was not a lot.

This was a good recipe but I felt like the proportions of ingredients was a little off.  I used about a half pound of pork sausage instead of the links and probably doubled the amount of onion asked for and it didn't cover the pan very well.  The only thing I had more that enough of was potatoes.  Other than that it tasted really good, especially with some salsa on top.  We're looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch.
