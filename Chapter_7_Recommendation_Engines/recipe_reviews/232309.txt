Really enjoyed this - the flavor is so good!  The hubby branded it an 'instant classic'. Followed the recipe almost exactly (drained and rinsed the black beans which was not specified in the recipe. Glad we did.)  Threw in the entire can (15 oz) of tomato sauce so we wouldn't be stuck with a half can. Also left out the seasoned salt completely after tasting it first - it didn't need it, it was plenty salty. Loved the sundried tomatoes in this even though I thought I would hate it, and I hate black beans but can barely notice it here.  Also read a cool trick for spaghetti squash - cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, add half a cup of water and place the other half back on it.  Microwave 12 minutes for a pound - if the top half is soft when it comes out, it's done. Otherwise, put it back in for a few more minutes.

I was pleased to find a recipe alternative to the traditional spaghetti squash with spaghetti sauce! This mixture could be put on anything - tortillas, taco shells, rice, lettuce - which is a good thing, because the recipe makes way too much "topping" for one spaghetti squash!

Thought it was good. I added some corn. Like others said, could use meat mixture on other things!

This recipe introduced me to spaghetti squash! I love it! I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes, so I've been adding Rotel tomatoes with cilantro & lime instead. Yummy. Thank you so much!! I have made it a bunch of times & will have it again tonight.

I made this tonight and it was absolutely fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly except I did not have tomato sauce on hand. I used a 6 oz can of tomato paste to with 1 cup water and Italian seasonings and used all of it. I had a couple of moments of confusion - the "1 cube of chicken bullion" should read 1 cup of chicken broth as you need the liquid and could use actual broth or cube or granules to make broth. The other was that you really want to start the turkey mixture before the squash is ready or your squash will get cool. Excellent taste and very healthy.

So good! My husband even went back for seconds and he claims to hate spaghetti squash! I want to try the meat mixture next time over rice. It’s a yummy stand alone sauce!

This is a very good family style dinner - it's full of veggies but no one noticed that, they just loved the taste and the fun of layering it over the squash.  I used ground chicken because I don't care for turkey.   I didn't have everything listed so I susbstituted canned flame roasted tomatoes for the sun dried, and used less broth to make up for the extra liquid in the tomatoes, and at the end I added a can of corn (drained) just to add some color.  Served with bowls of sour cream, grated chedder and chopped chives, this was a bit hit.  I'll be trying it in tacos, etc both because it's tasty and also because it's much healther than most taco style fillings, since it's so full of vegetables.   I think you could add a grated zucchini and no one would even notice, I'll be trying that next time.  BTW we've never been a fan of spaghetti squash, but it was excellent in this dish.  It did  however take a lot longer to bake (maybe my oven is off?)

I am pleasantly surprised!  I had to make a few adjustments due to what I had on hand- no tomato sauce so I used a can (with juices) of diced tomatoes.  I am not a fan of the ingredients in bouillon so I used about a half can of chicken broth which actually made it a bit runnier than I would have liked but let it simmer for about 10 minutes and turned out perfect.  Left out the beans although I'm sure they'd be good in this!  Squash needs to cook twice as long as stated.

Delicious! My family and I liked the flavor of this recipe. The sauce was so good and is good on its own too! ?? We will definitely make this again.

I enjoyed this.  It's really light with the spaghetti squash.  I didn't have any red pepper flakes or sun dried tomatoes, and I'm sure that would have helped the overall flavor.  I found it a tad bland without those.  I added mushrooms and thought that was a great addition.  I also cooked my squash in the microwave, which is easy and only takes about 10-15 minutes.

I used pinto beans instead of black beans, and added some corn as well.  Didn't have any sweet peppers but it still came out delicious.

Loved the favors combined with my spaghetti squash. Slight change, only because I was missing an ingredient but the change worked well. (While I don't understand the accuracy of recipe reviews after 75+% of the recipe gets changed!) I didn't have of the can of tomato sauce, so I used a can of diced tomatoes that already has jalapeños added.  Will definitely make again and again.

Double the spice, use with without the squash. It was great as left overs with egg and tortilla, or it great by itself. I did add 1/2 can of chicken broth as it needed moisture. A must to try. A very big. Hit at our house.

this was pretty tasty but a little on the salty side and that was with leaving out the seasoned salt like STARDUST_331 did.. i used this as a topping over baked potatoes and also as a filling for lettuce wraps.. i used a little less garlic (2 tsp) and doubled the cumin.. my tomato sauce was in an 8oz can so just used that.. bf said it was kind of like a mexican sloppy joe.. ty for the recipe

I didn't have spaghetti squash, (used rice instead) but I think you'd need two with the amount this makes.  Easily fed 6 of us with left overs.  I added shredded zucchini and corn.

This is like a Mexican spaghetti sauce! I did add more tomato sauce to get that consistency. Makes a great meal. I dolloped a little sour cream on top. Will make again.

Quick to make.  Spaghetti squash bakes while prepping and sauteing the veggies and ground beef.  Not too spicy.  I used yellow and orange peppers instead of green pepper. I regret adding the chicken bouillon.  Too salty.  My son suggests melting some shredded cheese over the top just before serving.

This is very good.  I had to omit the garlic.  I reduced the red pepper because I'm a wimp but I wish I hadn't.  It could have used a little more spice.

This was delicious! I always try to make a recipe exactly as written the first time but didn't have two ingredients so I made the following substitutions:

•(1) can of Ro-tel tomatoes for the sun-dried tomatoes
•1/2 can low sodium chicken broth for the chicken bullion cube

Served with cheese, sour cream & chopped avocados. Will definitely make again!

I didn't have any turkey, so I used ground chicken and as the poster suggested I bet any ground meat will do. Um, come to thnik of it, I also didn't have any sun-dried tomatos, so I guess I missed some of the more high-end flavours ... and I also used tomato paste  instead of sauce and added some water. Despite all those changes it turned out great - A great, budget, taco-esque filling that would be great for any family "Mexican" night. Goes great with the squash though! Thanks, will make again!

Enjoyed this very much.  Put a dollop of sour cream and that took it to another delicious level.

This was great.  I added corn and used veggie crumbles in place of the meat and it was very hearty.  we topped it with a bit of cheese and sour cream, and fresh diced tomoatoes.  really good, but didn't seem to pair as well with the spaghetti squash as I would have hoped.  it would make a fantastic chili with some added diced tomatoes and a bit of vegetable or chicken stock.  would also make a delicious nachos topping.
