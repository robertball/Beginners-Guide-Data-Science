This was very tasty and easy to do. I would definitely make it again, maybe drying a dry white wine or a red in place of the whiskey.

We loved this appetizer recipe.  We followed the recipe as written – no changes needed.  We served this slightly warm.  I don’t think the flavors would be as good if served cold.

This was pretty good. Made it twice in one weekend. It was good as a dip, and we also used it as a fish rub with panko breadcrumbs. So Yummy!!!! I think we used Talapia but I'm not sure. Thanks!!!

lol, my mushrooms never have a chance to get... weird :D but because I love them so much, I am always up for a new recipe.  tried this one because my husband's gotten into whiskey sipping lately and I knew I had some when generally I don't have alcohols called for in recipes... and also because I'd had another warm spread recently and loved it.   this was good!  I had it with sourdough rounds and crisped pita both.  I bet it'd be good on naan, and like the other reviewer did, I now want to try it with fish. Or with a steak mmmmm.  thanks!

So GOOD!  I didn't have the Scotch so I used a dash of white wine instead!  Great substitution!  The rosemary is great in this!  I served it on some jalapeno cheese bread rounds as well as some seeduction rounds.  Great spread!!
