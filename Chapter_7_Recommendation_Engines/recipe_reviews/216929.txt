These were very cute and a big hit with the friends I made them for. I did not have the sticks for making them into pops, so I made them into mini pies. The directions are simple to follow. Do pay attention to not overfilling them. Some of them can start pouring out like a blueberry volcano! I added 1 cup fresh blackberries to the filling and used 1/3 cup sugar. I also made a glaze of powdered sugar and milk and drizzled over them as soon as they came out of the oven and then topped with sprinkles. They looked like spring treats. I will be making these again.

I used this recipe to make cherry pie pops.  I was really frustrated overall with this recipe.  If i attempt these again, I would make 4" circles, and the 3" really don't give you enough room to crimp a good edge.  All of mine seperated, even though they were sealed properly and vented.  I also think that these are too big for a stick, but made very cute mini pies by themselves.  It was a great idea, just needs some work.

These are delicious and adorable! Had them at work, and they just flew out of the coffee room. Anyone who was 2 seconds late missed out. You can make them in any pie flavor.

Mine didn't turn out perfect, but they're delicious and adorable. I've never made a full-sized fruit pie before, and in hindsight I probably should have tried that out first. I over-filled several of the pies, and they leaked a bit of filling in the baking process. However, when you bite into one, there's quite a bit of empty space between the filling and the top crust. Dunno what caused that to occur. I think with a little more practice, this will be a favorite of mine. :]

I used Butter Flaky Pie Crust for the crust, a double batch made 18 pops with enough scraps to make a large turnover. I made my own apple filling using the Apple Pie Filling recipe. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top. Really good and cute!

These were THE hit at our Easter picnic. Difficult to crimp the edges of the crusts -- in the ones pictured they must have cut off some of the extra dough. But overall a very fun recipe.

Very yummy and fairly easy. Though I was feeling a bit lazy so I didn't form the cups. I made them flat. By making the cups you'd get more filling which would have been better. They looked really pretty anyways.

These were great.  I left them as mini pies instead of making them into pops but it was a great way to use up my leftover blueberries.  I tried not to overfill but even though I sealed and vented I still had some bubble over.  My husband who isn't a big fan of blueberry pie gobbled these up!

These are so good!  I made these with a nice butter-based crust, and it was the perfect balance of flaky crust, sweet filling, with a nice lemon/spice finish.  Be sure not to overfill the bottom crusts.  I made sure to leave a little more than 1/8" space to the top, it makes sealing the crusts together a lot easier.  I made a batch on sticks for my daughter's cheer squad, and a batch without for us.  They were a big hit with the girls, and I'm freezing the ones without sticks for whenever a hankering for pie hits!

Turned out great! They are cute and delicious. They are pretty time consuming but not difficult to do. The only thing I did different was substitute water for egg to make it vegan. Still looked and tasted great. Some reviewers said they had trouble crimping the edges. Try using a fork, it is very easy! (:

This was a great recipe! I used half a pint of blueberries and a full pint of raspberries. I didn't use the pop sticks, I just made the mini pies. I made 12 with a pilsberry pie crust on a flat cookie sheet, not a mini muffin tray. But they turned out great! I will make them again!

Flavor was great, but the pies got stuck, stuck, stuck - even using a nonstick pan.  What a mess!  I'm not sure if you should spray the pans or something; I don't usually with pie but not one of the pies popped out nicely.
