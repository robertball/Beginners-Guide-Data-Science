I have looked at this recipe many times but never got up the nerve to make it. The ingredients were so unusual, I think I was nervous. I tried this last night.. finally. What a pleasant surprise. It was quite good. The only change I made was to substitute water chestnuts for mushrooms, since I am not a mushroom fan.  Next time I make this, I think I am going to use canned beets, because the cooked beets were a real pain to peel and I got beet water all over the place..lol. I also think adding a few sunflower seeds or slivered almonds would be a nice addition.

I would preheat & get those potatoes & beets in right away, then make the wasabi dressing next time b/c of the lengthy cook time; and the dressing probably doesn't need to sit in the blender for an hour.

I used leftover chicken off of a rotisserie chicken--just the white meat--weighing it on a scale until I had the 3/4# and it worked out great.

Even my 2 year old appreciated the potatoes, beets & chicken (though he's still not keen on greens).  Submitted a photo--you'll need a BIG salad bowl to toss all together without a mess.

Bottom line?  Worth the time!  Delish.
