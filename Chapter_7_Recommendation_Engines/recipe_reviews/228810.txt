Please do not add butter to this recipe if you are wanting to can it.  It isn't safe to do so.

This is a good basic recipe.  I would comment to a previous review. You can absolutely safely add the small amount of butter cited. It is intended to keep the jelly from foaming. It is not an amount significant enough to cause a problem.

I agree with Mommy Lisa .I tried the recipe, once with diabetic sugar and another one with regular sugar and the same thing happened both happened. It was thinner with all regular sugar. The ingredients are not cheap;not for me anyway .

Jelly is . . . sweet!  It actually takes that much sugar to help the pectin set so it is not sweeter than any other jelly.  Never double a jelly recipe - don't know why but it will never set when doubled, in my experience. The recipe is fine.

I love it, tastes so good. I did have to add 2 packets , 1.75 oz each to get the proper consistency of Jelly.  Highly recommended, it really tastes delicious! The juice processed is really good too. I made 2 extra quarts of it because it was so good. Great recipe!

Turned out perfect. I'm sure I made a few modifications I can't remember now, but the basic recipe is what I used. I tried different combinations of apples. I had the best luck with Jonathan apples. I did three batches.  Two batches with winesap and one with Jonathan. (My said Jonathan apples had to be good for something.) Turns out he was right. 

I will say that you absolutely HAVE to use enough sugar. Not for the sweetness, but because it aids the natural pectin in the apples. If you dont' use enough sugar, the jelly will NOT set up right.  Also, the more red pealing you can use, the brighter the color your jelly will be. I added a couple drops of food coloring because I like that pretty orange coloring. :)

For all of you that have runny jelly, note that one package of iSure Jell is 1.8 oz, and NOT 2oz. If using Sure Jell than you must add more than just one pack.

I was torn between 3 and 4 stars. It tastes wonderful. It was easy and fast to make. I will say that this was my first attempt at making a jelly.
The reason it gets 3 stars is that it was not very jelly-like. It was on the runny side. I always use a knife to dig into the store-bought jelly. I had to use a spoon for this. But like I said, this was my first attempt, so maybe it was me and not the recipe.

I made this exactly as written. I have jelly that is very soft...almost syrup. It has wonderful flavor, but I am very unhappy with the consistency. I followed the directions exactly. I don't know if I should have added extra pectin or cooked it longer or what, but all I know is I have a bunch of jars of something that is not good for either jelly or syrup!

This recipe is fine.  A bit on the sweet side for me, but most jelly recipes are.  I'll cut down on the sugar and increase the pectin the next  time I make it.  Someone gave this a 1 star review because butter was added -  adding a tiny amount of butter is to prevent you from having alot of foam forming at the top of your jellies.  Most jelly recipes recommend adding butter.  There's no reason at all not to can using this recipe.

It was really good, but it was a little too juicy. I will try it again.
