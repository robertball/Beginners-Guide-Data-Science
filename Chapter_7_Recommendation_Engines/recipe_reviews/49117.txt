I used boneless chicken breasts because that's what I had & I cooked these inside on a grill pan. I used a jalapeno instead of a serrano (I have a jalapeno plant but no serrano) but other than that, I made no changes to this recipe. I am sooo glad I didn't! The spices on the chicken are very tasty & you might think you don't need the lime butter sauce...trust me, you want the lime butter! The flavor combo of the spices w/ the butter is fantastic. All it needed was just a sprinkle of sea salt to make it perfect!I served this w/ fresh corn on the cob (nuked it) & the butter was excellent on the corn as well. I also served a cold  Balsamic Green Bean Salad but that was sooo the wrong side for this meal. It's a really good salad but the balsamic w/ the lime butter was NOT a good pairing so I put the salad back in the fridge & we'll eat it later.

This was absolutely delicious, but the name is deceiving.  It's not what I'd consider "Southwestern" because it's not at all spicey.  Maybe they are thinking of the lime butter....it's really got more of a sweet taste though.  Whatever you call it, it's darn good!  I highly recommend it.

This was just delicious.  The lime butter is what can be spicy, but you can control that with the type of chili pepper you use.  I tone it down a bit and use a jalepeno instead of the serrano. Or an anaheim chili makes it mild enough for my most tender-mouthed child.

The rub is tasty but  be aware, that it burns very easily (on a medium heat grill). So, by the time the chicken was done, it was very charred. But no matter... we don't eat the skin, so it was discarded anyway leaving a good flavor still on the chicken. Then the lime butter (we used as a dip) made for a very different and delicious dish. The only thing I would change is use only half of the cinnamon, as we thought it was too prominent.

We made this tonight and really enjoyed it!! I made a few changes so that is why I gave it only 4 stars.  I made the marinade and put it on the boneless chicken breasts at least 2 hours ahead of time.  I think that the cinnamon was a little overpowering so I will cut back to about 1/2 next time. Otherwise the flavors we faboulus.  I would  NEVER serve without the Lime Butter...NEVER.  Make sure when you are grilling the chicken breasts that you season them with salt and pepper...it adds so much to the flavor.  When I made te Lime Butter I mixed it with a little lime zest, and about 2 tsp. garlic salt, and I added at least 3 tbsp lime juice.  Just before the chicken breasts were done I topped them with the lime butter sauce and basted them for a while.  The flavors were fantastic.  I would definately make this agian!!!  Very so Yummmmmy!!!!!!!!!!

It's been a while since Husband gave a meal a really enthusiastic two thumbs up, but this one was a complete hit. I marinaded boneless skinless chicken breasts all day, and cooked them on the Foreman grill. Served it over plain white rice with a generous pat of the butter. Outstanding! Thank you!

This is an excellent recipe. i first used it in the summer for a barbeque, and then recently made a slight variation to make it a fall dish. I omitted the lime butter altogether, and included sliced apples in the rub/marinade along with the chicken. i arranged the apples on top of the chicken and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes, til the apples were soft and the chicken cooked through. I served it to guests, and it got rave reviews.

We disagree with several of the previous reviews. We found the rub to be bland. Not much flavor. The lime butter saved this recipe from being more of a disappointment. We won't use this one again.

This recipe is amazing!  We had our friends over for a barbecue and they all loved it.  We made it with a Mexican Rice from this site and one of our friends brought an Avocado Salad.  All of the flavours went well together.  Make this recipe, its a keeper!

This is the #1 grilled chicken in this house. I've been preparing it for about 2yrs. now and not one complaint. We use leg & thighs grilled over coals. Serve with a side of fruit salsa, and grilled corn. We're from Texas and these spice are used in Tex-Mex, and Mexican cuisine. Excellant.

You definitely should try this recipe!!! The chicken is very good without the lime butter, but the butter makes it awesome!! If you're not a fan of cilantro, feel free to leave it out. (I had a guest that didn't like cilantro, so I split the butter recipe to make half with cilantro and half without.) He thought it was excellent as well. 

My only deviations were that I added some lime zest to the butter and used boneless chicken breasts. FABULOUS!! Easy recipe and absolutely delicious. This one is a keeper for me! I would serve this at a Caribbean/Mexican/Tropical dinner party in a heartbeat.

Also, don't be afraid of the serrano chili pepper. The butter basically cancels out all of the heat, so all you have is a lovely light pepper flavor.

The only thing I changed was to use a jalapeno, as that was all I had available. Excellent recipe! My family loved it. Thanks!
UPDATE: I have made this many times since I reviewed this. It is a great company meal. We always make the paste ahead and let it sit on the chicken. Then bake instead of grill. Also, I have found the butter holds up better if it is not melted, just softened and all the ingredients mixed in like a paste. Also, the last time I made it, I found I was out of balsamic vinegar. So I subbed lime juice to give it the acidity. It was wonderful!

I give the lime-butter sauce five stars but the chicken itself only four.  Because it was raining heavily when I made this, I could not grill the chicken.  That may make a big difference in taste.  Overall a very good tasting recipe although not "Southwestern" by my interpretation.  I have no suggestions for changes and I will certainly make again but grill in order to make a more fair judgement of this recipe.

This was wonderful!! I made the paste and put it on the chicken and let it refrigerate overnight. I than baked it instead of grilling because I was too lazy :D I tasted this first without the lime butter. Very good. The lime butter put this over the top. WOW. I didn't use real butter as the fat calories terrified me but it still was excellent. I used a low fat spread and added some butter buds to give it the buttery flavor.I certainly will make this again.

This is good.  I like the combination of the sweet chicken with the spicy lime butter.  Although the chicken was a little too sweet for me so I think next time I may cut down on the cinnamon as other reviewers have suggested as well.

I was shocked at how good this was. Me and my hubby both loved it and plan on making it over and over. I followed the recipe to a T except for replacing the butter with I Can't Bleieve it's not Butter Light. I think it is otherwise perfect as is!!! Thank you!!!

I wanted to love this, but it was just ok.  I did not have cilantro, so that could have made a difference.  I served it w/Spinach w/a Twist from this site and I devoured the Spinach but left lots of chicken on my plate.  My husband and guests ate theirs, but no rave reviews like I usually get. It's unique and worth a try, it's just not my fav. I actually think I might try the lime butter on a blackened filet.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe after reading the great reviews.  The cinnamon was a bit strong.  If I made this again, I would probably cut the cinnamon amount in half and add some lime zest to the lime butter.  I did cut the butter back to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts and 4 thigh with skin and bones on.  Keep a close eye on these when they're on the grill as they tend to burn easily.  The skin on the chicken thighs came out very burnt.  The overall flavor of the (not burnt) pieces was good...great with the lime butter.

I absolutely LOVED the Lime Butter portion of this recipe.  I found the seasoning for the chicken too odd for my tastebuds.  I have since just added the lime butter to a plain grilled chicken breast and it is to die for.  This is now an alltime favorite.

I thought this recipe was incredible, and my parents agreed! Absolutely perfect, I didn't make a single recipe change (well, other than we didn't have any bone-in chicken). I'll definately be making it again!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The chicken reminded us of a mole sauce.  The lime butter sauce drizzled on the top made the dish!

Delicious!  I served it as close to the recipe as possible and everyone loved it :)  I used chicken thighs on the bone and removed the skin, added the marinade/spice mix an hour or so before grilling, so it had time to marinade.  Only had a jalapeno, no chiles available, and I just removed the seeds and membrane so it wasn't hot at all.  VERY well worth trying and I will make this again :)

This chicken tastes AMAZING!  The flavors all work so well together.  Don't expect any heat from this, just great taste.  I used boneless skinless breasts, and cut the butter in half but not the rest of the ingredients.  We had leftovers, and it tasted even better the next night!  I also have a 2 and almost 4 year old, who ate it without complaint (granted, they are used to eating freshly-made meals and not boxed/frozen/add-a-can-of-soup meals, but I wasn't sure about the flavor combo~no problem!).  I look forward to fixing this again!

Made this as directed, and it was average at best.  The flavors in the wet rub were interesting, but DEFINITELY needed a kick - perhaps cumin or cayenne?  The butter sauce made  it palatable.  We won't make this again.

For as many seasonings as this had, I was disappointed that it didn't have more flavor.  It was good, but I don't see myself searching for the recipe to make again.  The cilantro lime butter was good.  We also put this on corn, but I think it would be equally good on other vegetables.

Excellent. Made for very picky husband, who thought I had burned it at first (sauce is dark). Then he said it was great, and one of the best chicken dishes he had had in a looong time. He blames the new grill, but I know it was the sauce. I never got around to even making the butter. I'm making it again tonight and will pull off the butter this time. 
Don't change a thing. Excellent recipe.

What a great recipe!  I scaled it down and used it to make tuna steaks for two.  I also used margarine instead of butter (for those lactose intolerant folks).  Served with steamed vegetable rice and simplay sauteed (oil and salt) spinach. It got rave reviews - which in a home that eats very well is saying something!

Oh my, this was wonderful. The combination of the cinnamon, chili powder and cocoa was amazing. I used a little less cinnamon at first because I was hesitant because of the few bad reviews but after I smelled the mixture together I added the left over cinnamon because it smelled great. I cannot wait to have company over for a bar-b-q and use this recipe.

Surreal!  I have nothing but love for this dish.  However, I would suggest keeping the butter to a minimum.  The other flavors are so great that you can take that down a notch.

Very good! The marinade has a very unique flavor that goes so well with the lime butter.  I can't imagine omitting the lime butter from this recipe.  I did not have any chile peppers so I just added a dash of cayenne to the butter.  Still tasted great.  Great recipe for summer.  (I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts)

i wasn't all that impressed with the rub, it was ok but not very exciting.  the butter was delicious though!  i really liked the serrano pepper in it.  i cooked the (boneless) chicken in the stove set on broil for about 15 mins.  i had the chicken on the rack from our toaster oven over a pan.  my only real complaint was that the pan wasn't big enough for all 4 pieces of chicken i cooked and i had to throw in the last one after the first 3 were done and by that tiem the dripping were starting to burn.  so next time i'll either get a bigger pan or do it in an actual grill

This was so good.  I loved all of the flvors together- especially the cilantro lime butter.  I drizzled that over the broccoli on my plate, too!  It was delicious and even my 5-year old loved it.  It wasn't overly hot or spicy, either.  Don't be scared of the hot peppers!

This was really delicious! Loved the "spread" on the chicken, and the butter sauce really accompanied it very well! I used boneless chicken breasts cooked for 12 minutes on the grill. I also used sea salt instead of regular. My husband doesn't like spicy food, so I used a jalapeno pepper instead of a serrano chile (produce guy said it was less potent) and scarped out all the seeds and membrane so there was very little "kick" in the sauce. I also used a red onion instead of white because I had some left over from another recipe. I served this with Roasted Vegetables (from this site, submitted by Saundra) which were wonderful, and even better with a little of the butter sauce on them! I think I'll use the sauce on other dishes. Yum!

Superb! I've made this at least a half dozen times now and it is always a hit. Everyone raves aobut it. The flavors and the lime butter sauce are amazing. You can taste all the individual ingredients, and together it is so satisfying savory. The cocoa is a welcome addition to this southwestern style dish!

I have used this site for over 5 years and this is my first review - this is one of the BEST chicken dishes I've ever eaten - with every bite the family kept saying "mmmmmmm".  I didn't have a jalapeno, so I used a chipotle in adobo sauce - I'll make this often!

This was an excellent recipe!  I marinated the chicken for a couple of hours in the "seasoning paste".  I used jalepenos instead of serrano peppers since that's all I had on hand. We really enjoyed the flavor of the paste.  Will definitely make this again.  So easy!

When making this all I could think of was how anyone could dream up the odd mix of ingredients.  All I can say is THANK YOU - THANK YOU! Just delicious.  Don't change a single thing!  The only cilantro I had was in a tube - I am so glad that I took the time to go to the store for fresh!  I don't know if it would rally have made a difference but this recipe was truly outstanding just the way it is written.  I did use skinless chicken breast with a bone, and at the very end of grilling I added the lime butter to the chicken, I saved some of it and put in in a ramkin for dipping. I might double the sauce next time because it would be very good to keep refigerated until you can grill some fresh vegetables to go with it. LOVED THIS!!!

This is sooo yummy! You must make the butter too. It really compliments the chicken. I too used a jalepeno instead of a serrano. I also used chicken breasts and pounded them flat to about 1/2 inch. They cooked up really quick on the grill and were so tender too. Thanks for the unique & tasty recipe!

I only made one substitution (I couldn't find a serrano; I used a poblano) but it was fantastic.  I wouldn't have expected a butter/cilantro/chile sauce to go well with an oil/vinegar/cinnamon rub, but it exceeded expectations!  I thought I had cooked too much for the dinner party, but every piece was eaten, and the recipe was requested.

I didn't have a lot of the ingredients so I improvised and it was still great.

What a wonderful recipe for grilled chicken.  Its fast, easy and tastes wonderful!  I made a few small change since I didn't have a few of the ingredients.  I used lemon juice instead of the lime, and a thai pepper instead of the one in the recipe.  Next time I will make sure I have everything on hand.

Okay, I made several changes...I cubed the chicken, used Italian dressing (that's all I had) and added about 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp cocoa powder & several drops hot sauce, and marinated the chicken in it for 2+ hours.  I then skewered it w/yellow peppers and grilled until just a bit crispy on edges.  I served it w/Basmati rice (which was a bit bland).  The chicken turned out awesome (despite the rice)...never expected that the cinnamon & choc would make such a difference.  Next time I'll try the full recipe as written and will try the lime butter which would've helped the rice.

This was very delicious!  It was nice to have something different.   I used bone-in skin on breasts only.  Next time I think I'll try using Extra virgin olive oil instead of butter to make it a bit healthier.

I gave this recipie to my mom to try but she didnt have any basalmic so instead used raspberry vinegar.  My family loved it, but I got the most interesting description.  My 18 year old sister said it tasted like Christmas.  My father agreed.

I am not a big fan of chicken but this was uniquely delicious!  I upped the salt/pepper a little and used boneless breasts instead of bone-in.  The lime butter was scrumptious and could easily be used on fish.  Give it a try you will not be disappointed.

Awesome! Everyone loved this recipe! The butter is so unique and makes the recipe taste straight from a restaurant. The only changes I made were...I used 1 1/2 lbs. boneless chicken breasts and jalapeno instead of serrano chile. Yummy!!

I also thought the cinnamon was overpowering. I did not use the cocoa...which I am glad I left out. I added twice as much lime juice and also added garlic. Would still make again--with adjustments.

We didn't care for this recipe - and we both like Southwest.  The cinnamon combination just didn't hit right.  I hoped the lime butter would set it off or something since everyone else seemed to love it so much, but it didn't really change that much.  I won't be making it again.

Don't let the "southwestern" in the name mislead you -- this is spiced, but not spicy. Kids and adults both enjoyed it.

Made this for the whole family and it was a big hit.The only thing that I didn't like was the cinnamon flavor was a little stronger then I would have liked,but next time I'll just cut the amount in half...definitely making this again!

I prepared this as written. We liked it enough to eat it, but not enough to make it again. Definitely use the lime-butter sauce.

To me -it had more of a middle Eastern flair!  I loved this recipe and my family raved.  I made it on the stove top - frying the chicken in a tad of butter.  It was perfectly juicy and the lime butter made it fabulous!  I will definitely make this again and again.  I am going to take it on the next camping trip too!

I used chicken breasts cut in half and grilled them on the BBQ. The marinade had a lovely flavour and gave the chicken a nice golden brown finish. I don't think the lime butter sauce added much flavour. Could have been because I added the onion to the marinade instead of the sauce as I don't like raw onion. Next time I would probably use the marinade with lime juice added and skip the butter sauce.

Excellent & easy. I used about 2.5 pounds of boneless chicken breasts. That reduced the grilling time a bit (about 15 minutes or so, but our grill gets really hot when closed... even on low flame). The butter was a wonderful highlight, but about half of it was left in the bottom of the serving dish. I think I'll cut the lime butter portion in half to cut down on the fat a bit.

This was a wonderful recipe. We have used it with guest several times. I thought that the baste was a little too cinnaminee, so I cut it in half which made it much better.
