I used a 9-lb spiral cut honey cured ham with the stated brown sugar amounts and cooked on low for 4 hours.  I sealed over the ham with foil and then put on the lid.  The ham was delicious and very moist.  This is a great option for large family gatherings when your oven is being used for other dishes.  I'll definitely use this one again.

I am sure this is a great recipe from all the reviews. The problem I had was I have a small crock pot, so I purchased a 3 lb picnic ham which to my delight fit perfectly in my crock pot. I had no idea how to adjust the time difference so I figured 3-4 hours on low. Apparently it was done in about an hour or two.  At 3 1/2 hrs it was brown and tough and in the garbage. So I just wanted to write this to help someone in the same predictament.

Just be sure to buy a picnic ham (picnic shoulder or pork shoulder?)and not a smoked ham like I did!  By mistake I used a bone-in smoked ham & this was weird. It turned dark brown and fell apart.  Otherwise, am sure it's a good recipe like the others say.  Wish recipe had stated to NOT use a traditional smoked ham for us who don't normally buy non-traditional pork cuts.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! Sooo easy, and it turned out excellent. My husband wanted ham for Thanksgiving, and I knew the oven would be in use, so I wanted a slow cooker recipe. This one was perfect. I used a 2½ pound boneless ham, so I cut the brown sugar down to around 3/4 of a cup (½ cup in the bottom of the slow cooker and 1/4 cup rubbed on the ham). I flipped it around periodically while cooking so all sides would be evenly coated, plus I basted it once in a while with the brown sugar syrup. Even my picky 2-year old daughter (who does NOT like meat) enjoyed it... She finished a whole serving! Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Mmmmm - really delicious, and my mother-in-law kept tellimg me how good it was!  I used a shank-end spiral-sliced ham and was able to squeeze it into my 7 qt slow cooker by laying it sideways and kind of squishing it in (the spiral slicing made it kind of flexible).  One word of caution to anyone wishing to use a spiral-sliced ham.... 8 hours is really too long, try 4 or 5 hours.  I can't wait to try this recipe with a non spiral-sliced ham.

Thanks for the recipe! Just a turkey wasn't going to be enough meat for Thanksgiving this year, so being able to cook a ham on the counter and not worry about oven space was a blessing!
I studded the ham with whole cloves and layed pineapple rings on top of it as my mom does and added the juice to the brown sugar mixture on the bottom. My guests were in love with the way my house smelled, and by the end of the night there was turkey left over, but not a bit of ham!!

This was the best ham I ever had! I grew up on a hog farm, so I've eaten my fair share of it too.
It was so juicy and tender, I had to serve it with a spoon because it just fell apart!  My husband absolutely loved it and said that I better hold on to this recipe.  I think I can remember it, its so simple.

I am a slow cooker novice, and the fact that this recipe had no liquid scared me a little, so I did add a little water to the brown sugar at the bottom to make it soupy, and only used a cup and a half of brown sugar.
I don't think I would have needed to though, there was alot of liquid from the ham.  
Definate keeper! Mmmmmm!!

I only had a small 2.5 lb. ham without a bone and it still turned out great in my small crock pot with 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar.  It wasn't dry at all.

I'm Australian, so I has to use a 2.5 kilosemi-boneless shoulder ham from Woolies. I was worried that one ham and no liquid would result in burnt sugar all over the crock pot, so I added one little juice box of tropical juice and only used 1 cup of brown sugar. This worked beautifully, and the ham was fully cooked (i.e. the ham bone pulled out)after 7 hours.

My ham didn't quite fit in the crock pot, to I tightly covered the top of the crockpot with aluminum foil and rested the lid on top, and it cooked just fine.

A great way to cook ham! I will definitely use this one again, especially at holidays when you need the oven for something else.

This is so easy, and it's delicious! I do mix a little pineapple juice with the brown sugar--for flavor, not b/c you need the moisture. The only thing I would warn about: cook time. The first time I did this was w/ a 10 pound spiral-cut, I intentionally lowered the cook time to 4 hours--it was still more than I would have liked. Now when I use this recipe I just feel the ham (I have to use foil over the top b/c the lid won't fit) until it's warm all the way through--about 3 hours on low, 1 1/2-2 on high. Anyway, hopefully that helps someone! :)

This is one of our favorite recipes and  have made it a half a dozen times or so. It is so easy to prepare before I go to work in the morning and when I get home it is ready and delicious. What a welcome smell when I walk in the door. Thanks for this recipe.

Some will love this, some won't. We LOVED it.  If you like dishes like pulled pork or a potroast that falls apart in shreds, this is a great way for you to prepare ham.  It gets all the meat and flavor off the bone and there is very little waste, though you have to be willing to pick through the mass of meat and discard little bits of gristle and fat.                                 I don't think you need to find the "picnic ham" that the recipe lists (I think it suggests that kind because it is cheaper and because this recipe allows you to get all the meat off the bone).  You can use any smoked ham, alhough, as others have suggested, stay away from the spiral sliced hams.  Get an unsliced one.       Speaking of spiral sliced, if your idea of ham is beautiful, pink slices on a holdiday plate, this is probably not the recipe for you. For that kind of a presentation, the ham should just be heated through or glazed a bit.   But if you like a pile of delicious meat to pick through that is tender, juicy, and flavorful, try this recipe.  I prepared exactly as instruted except also put a few slices of pineapple on top in the crock pot (no juice) and just a sprinkle of ground cloves on the brown sugar.  Neither was necessary, though.

Excellent Recipe Cook Time is way to long. If you own a fairly new crock pot brought within the last 5-10 years you only need to cook for 1 to 2 hours max. If you leave the ham in the crock pot after it is turned off it will still continue to cook. I used a honey smoked spiral ham 9lb ham. I added pancake syrup nutmeg and cinnamon to the brown sugar and ham I covered it with foil and then put the top on it for 2 hours. It came out beautiful and delicious - I think it would have been even better if I cooked it for an hour and let it sit in the juices for another hour. Becareful spiral hams dry out very easy. Even on this low temp and cooking for only 2 hours  I had a few pieces that were dry but the rest of the ham was moist and outstanding to say the least. You do not need to add any liquid - your crock pot will be half full with the liquid the ham produces when it is done!

This is the second time I have reviewed this great recipe.  This time I am adding an additional twist.  When the pork has finished cooking in the crock pot, remove it to a plate and tightly cover with tin foil. Don't worry, it will stay hot and moist for the time you need to do the rest.  Strain the juices into a saucepan and heat. Take some of the juice and add cornstarch and blend to a runny paste.  It is important NOT to use flour and to use cornstarch as this is a sauce, not a gravy. Add the paste to the juice in the saucepan and boil it to cook and thicken. Then add what ever you would like for taste.  I added a couple of teaspoons of mustard, just enough to give it a bit of tartness but not enough to overwelm it.  It helps to do a taste test before adding more.  The result is an amazing sauce to serve with the cooked pork. Yummy!

This recipe results in a moister ham than one baked in the oven.  You CAN use a pre-cooked spiral cut ham, but you have to cook it for a much shorter time than the recipe indicates. I used a 10 lb. spiral cut, pressed the brown sugar all around it, and drizzled with a little honey.  I added a 6 oz. can of pineapple juice for some moisture.  I couldn't cover the crockpot, so I put a small piece of foil over the top of the ham itself (to prevent the condensation from leaking out) and then sealed the crock pot with another larger piece of heavy duty foil.  I cooked for 3 1/2 hours on low and that was more than enough.  Baste with juice after you remove foil, and baste again when you put it on the serving plate.  The result was a ham that moist and delicious.  It was a big hit, and needed no attention after the initial set up in the crockpot.

I've made this recipe a couple times, and it's wonderful.  You'll get better results if you get a bone-in butt or shank portion ham, but not spiral sliced.  I pour a 6-oz. can of pineapple juice in the bottom of the cooker, put in ham, and only about a cup of brown sugar on top.  If you can't get the lid on tight because of the ham size, cover tightly with foil.

I make this ham all the time.  So simple and it comes out falling to pieces (which is what it's supposed to do) and deliciously sweet.  Only thing I do different is to put the brown sugar in about 1 cup of boiling water.  You really don't need to do that I just like a little liquid in there to get it going but the ham will make enough liquid to cover itself.  I get a whole smoked (totally cooked) bone-in ham from the farmer at the market.  I haven't ever looked but you could get that at the grocery store or local meat market too.  I don't know what a "picnic" ham is but I really wouldn't suggest a pre-sliced ham.  My mom grew up on an Iowa pork farm and says this is just like her mom made.  Please don't think that this recipe will result in a ham that would be on the cover of a magazine.  It's all about the natural flavor of the ham here.

I think I am the only one out of all the reviews that had trouble with this. I was so excited to prepare this because the ratings were so high. But it just didnt' work out for me.
I did exactly as the recipe said. I had to trim some of the meat to it would fit, and even still it wasn't a perfect fit so i covered the crock with tin foil.  I cooked on low for eight hours during the night, i woke up in time to shut it off so it didn't over cook.  To my surprise there was burnt sugar and no juices as everyone else speaks of.  I turned the meat over and added a quarter cup of water and let cook a few hours longer it did indeed make juice but by that time the juices were overruled by smell of the burnt sugar.  My kids thought i made pulled pork! I ended up running out to the store to buy a roast for dinner instead, wouldnt' have been a big deal if i didn't have company coming over.  
I just dont' know what i did wrong, not sure i want to risk it again though.

This was the BEST ham I have ever had, Period. I was a little concerned because of the cost of the meat and it was Easter but decided why not. I had a double smoked bone in ham @ 7-8 lbs fully cooked. I put the brown sugar in the bottom, put ham in poured a little bit of pineapple juice on top and rubbed brown sugar all over the ham. Cooked on low for 4 hours and never lifted the lid. Wonderful rave reviews, juicy, cut like a dream!! I will never make a ham any other way EVER!! Thanx for such a great recipe!!!

I will never use oven space to bake a ham again.  I just used a 9 lb Farmer John ham, it was too big to use the lid on my slow cooker, so I just sealed really tight with 2 layers of heavy duty foil before I placed he crock inside the cooker. I used 2 cups brown sugar and added sliced pineapple. I was short on time so I cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours. It was perfect! Juicy and tender and came out even better than it does in the oven.  Will definitely make again for the next holiday. Thanks!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner to serve along side the turkey.  I got more compliments on the ham than the turkey.  I am known for making a delicious turkey however this ham out shined it.  Hard to believe something so simple could be so delicious.  My step daughter said she only eats honey baked hams but this one was better.  For the most part I followed the recipe with a few adjustments.  I cut off the thick layers of fat from the pork shoulder ham.  Prepared ham & crockpot with the brown sugar.  I covered the top of crockpot with foil until the ham started shrinking from cooking then I replaced foil with crockpot lid.  When it started showing signs of being done I turned it over on one side.  Let it cook for a bit then turned it on the other side. This was the easiest and most delicious part of the meal. A must try.

Awesome!  My husband insist on me cooking ham this way from now on.  I too ran into the issue of my ham being too big.  The bone would not allow the lid to fit on so since the crock portion of my crock pot was oven proof, I left the recipe as is, put aluminum foil over it and put it in the oven for the same amount of time on 250 degrees.  Most crock pots cook between 200 (low) and 300 (high) degrees.  It was soooo tender it fell off the bone and even in the oven, with no water added, I still ended up with many inches of water turned juice.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Five stars for ease of preparation alone! Absolutley one can use a precooked smoked ham. I used one that was 7.5 lbs, added 1/3 C water and let it go on low for two hours. Excellent!

Here's a tip:  look at at the reviews in reverse rating order (click sort by rating twice) so that you end up reading all the negative reviews first.  It really gives some insight into the recipe.  This is especially useful when there are hundreds of reviews. Having said this I was skeptical cuz of all the neg. reviews.  I can honestly say this is a great, simple recipe.  Followed to the letter, I don't how you can wrong?  Some people put foil over top, maybe this causes excess browning?  Obviously you have to use your discretion for cooking times, especially with various makes and models of crockpots.  If you're home you can periodically baste with the juices.  I LOVED this recipes.  So super duper easy, moist and melted in my mouth.  YUM!

Excellent recipe.  I've made this three times now. I give it four stars only because I had to make some adjustments.  I find that since most hams are fully cooked, you only need a few hours for this recipe.  Not nearly as long as the recipe calls for.  If I hadn't checked my ham, it would have been all dried out.  I put ALL the brown sugar on top of the ham.  I followed the recipe and put the brown sugar in the bottom the first time I did this, and the bottom couple of inches of the ham were a little too doused in brown sugar.  It saturates the meat, and tastes kind of funky.  Also, I put a double layer of aluminum foil over the entire crock pot container, and put the lid down on top of it to reflect heat back down to the top portion of the ham.  With the changes I made, this was an excellent way to free up oven space for holiday dinners.

This ham was fantastic!  Had to modify the recipe a little bit, because I was only cooking for two.  Used a 2 lb. smoked, boneless shoulder butt ham, a 1/2 cup brown sugar, and cooked for approximately 4 hours on low.  About 2 hours into the cooking time, I was worried that the sugar would start to stick to the crock pot and burn, so I also added a 1/2 cup of applesauce to the melting brown sugar, and during the last hour of cooking, brushed the ham frequently with the brown sugar and applesauce mixture.  Was soooo incredibly tasty!  I will be making this often.

This worked out very well! I had a boneless 4 lb spiral cut ham & I had a heck of a time trying to decide how long it should be in there for! I used about 1 1/2 c. brown sugar & poured a bit of orange juice in, basting it w/ it's own juices occasionally. It turned out really well, I cooked it for 2 hrs. on low (8 hr. setting) and then set it to warm another 30 in. until I was done preparing the rest of the meal. By the end of the cooking time there was about 1 in. of juice in the bottom of the pot. Nothing was burnt, as some previous reviews had mentioned. It really didn't taste too different from cooking it in the oven but it did come out juicy & tasty!  Maybe I'll add more brown sugar next time (I love it!). I'll definitely use this recipe again, esp. for the convenience factor of not having to cook it in the oven along with the 4 other dishes I had to cook!

My ham was a huge, pre-cooked one, so I cut it in half and could only fit half in my big oval crockpot. I lay the cut side down on the brown sugar, drizzled about 1/4 C pineapple juice over it, spread a little more sugar over the top, then studded it with cloves. Even though I forgot to turn it a few times while cooking, and left it longer than planned (it was in 7 h ours) it didn't dry out, but was very moist and juicy. I sliced it and put the pieces into containers, spooning the juices from the bottom of the pot in with them. Now they should soak up even more of the sugar/pineapple/clove flavor. This was so super-simple and easy!!

What a great idea !!  Ham in a crock pot.  I used a 7 lbs smoked boneless ham.  One cup of brown sugar on the bottom of crock pot.  I then added the juice from a can of sliced pineapple.  Once ham was in pot I scored the ham, I then used about a 1/2 cup of Real maple syrup on top of ham then sprinkled a little nutmeg and cinnamon on top of that.   I then topped the ham off with about 5 pineapple slices then added the rest of the pineapple to the pot.  I cooked on high about 3 hours and then on low for about 3 hours. I basted the ham often and used tooth picks to keep the pineapple from falling off the ham. My husband is not a lover of ham but he LOVED this.  He was bragging to his family who lives in New York how wonderful this was.  This is the only way I will ever make hame again!!!!

Wow!  This recipe is foolproof!  I have made this twice in the past month with a bone-in picnic ham.  The first time I had an 10.5 pound ham, and second time I had an 8.5 pounder.  Both times the ham was slighlty taller than my crockpot for the lid to fit tightly.  So, I covered the top of the ham completely with foil, and put on the lid.  I draped a heavy tea towel across the top of the lid to help with the escaping heat around the edges where it did not fit properly.  After a couple of hours the ham had baked downed enough so that the lid would fit tightly, but I left the towel in place.  I also set the temperature on high for the first two hours, since the lid was ajar.  After that, I cooked on low for four hours.  Amazing!

I made this yesterday for Christmas and it came out dry as my desk and dark chocolate brown in color; the crockpot was full of all the juices from the ham. Plus, I only cooked it 6 1/2 hours and not 8 as the recipe says.  We threw it out BEFORE dinner.
In fairness, after talking to several friends, the problem was the fact that I used a 10# Farmer John spiral cut ham, not a picnic ham.  I didn't know there would be a difference in cooking times.   So, for those of you who try this, be sure to use a picnic ham and maybe you'll have better results.

Excellent! The keys to success are, make sure whatever ham you choose fits your crockpot, and watch carefully after the first 4 or 5 hours. Newer crockpots seem to cook hotter than the old ones, so be aware. Mine overcooked after 6 hours in a newer, rectangular crockpot. Add the pineapple as suggested, and stud with a few whole cloves. Smells & tastes "Heavenly"...

This ham turned out very tender! I poured a can of pinapple chunks over the ham before cooking. I used a lot less brown sugar because of the sweetness that the pinapple added. I just rubbed the brown sugar all over the ham instead of putting it on the bottom.

Great ham that was juicy and fall apart tender!  I used a 6.5 pound smoked butt ham.  Since I didn't have 8 hours for this recipe I put it on high for 2 hours and 3 hours on low and it was done.  I used one 6 oz can pineapple juice, the brown sugar called for and a few dashes of cloves since I have to have that with ham.  It was delicious and one I will make again.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made this ham last year for Christmas and received request by family to have for Thanksgiving. I let it cook for 3-4 hours on low with me monitoring it. (8 lbs.)  I also add cherries and pineapples on top. ( my mother's favorite toppings) Rule: allow 20 minutes per pound on cooking for high setting, 30 minute minutes for low.

I made this recipe for our Easter dinner and it was a huge success! I'm a vegetarian so my skill in cooking meat is limited and I love the fact that this recipe is so simple! My husband loves using the slow-cooker because the smell permeates the whole house. I did have to chop off the top part of the ham to fit into my crockpot (I froze the unused part for later). If you need more ham but your slow-cooker won't hold it, I suggest borrowing more slow-cookers - this is the easiest way to make ham! I was afraid since I ended up only cooking about 6 pounds of ham that 8 hours might dry it out, but it was fine. There was so much juice, even though no liquid was added. Before I made the recipe I read that when cooking ham, the fat melts off and creates liquid - that's why it isn't necessary to add any water to the slow-cooker. At the end of 8 hours there was nearly 2 inches of liquid in my crockpot! My husband and son both loved this recipe!  I loved the convenience of putting it in the crockpot and forgetting about it! I was able to cook the rest of our Easter dinner without taking up space in the oven. And, as most people always have brown sugar on hand, you never have to worry about missing an ingredient! I'm not going to bother cooking ham any other way - we have a new Easter tradition!

Delicious! Got an 8lb spiral cut honey cured bone-in ham, covered the bottom in brown sugar, covered the ham in brown sugar, as per the instructions. Added a can of pineapple slices all over the ham, poured in the remaining pineapple juice, set the crockpot to low for 4 hours. Alas, bone-in made it impossible to cover in my slow cooker, so I followed someone else's advice and just covered the whole thing in foil for the duration of the cook. When the ham was done, I threw some maraschino cherries on top and called it done. It was beautiful, smelled wonderful, TASTED fantastic, didn't take up any room in my already full oven, and served as a great last minute addition to our Thanksgiving feast! Will definitely make it again next year!

I got a similar recipe from a coworker who advised she brushed on some honey mustard over the ham before applying the brown sugar coating. I would take this a step farther to retain moisture by encasing the ham in one of those twist-tied large oven roaster bags and set the entire package into the crock for cooking. Instead of basting, pick up the bag wearing oven mitts and turn upside down to let all the juices flow to the oppposite side during last half of cooking. Since crock temps vary quite a bit, adjust your time for a hot crock versus a warm crock.

Things I learned from the butcher: a picnic ham is a shoulder. Almost no stores in my area carry it.  If it's cured - it's cooked.  So you probably want 4 hours in the slow cooker (like the spiral hams).  Otherwise - 8 hours. I have to toss everything I bought and start over.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was so yummy. I did use a smoked ham and left it on in the crockpot for 4 hours or so. It was perfect. The house smelled so good when we walked in from Christmas Eve church. I will definitely  make this again!

This was the best and easiest way to cook ham I've ever made.   I bought a 9 lb spiral sliced ham and used the brown sugar rub that came with it (about 1 cup) adding another cup.  Just rubbed it down good and put it in the slow cooker with pineapple slices and cherries attached with whole cloves.  I'm glad other reviewers warned me against putting in liquid because I was tempted to pour in the pineapple juice.  Glad I didn't!  By the end of the cook time, the slow cooker was nearly completely filled with juice.  I basted it periodically and when we went to take the ham out it fell into pieces it was so tender.   Had the best flavor of any ham my family had ever tried.  Got rave reviews from the hubby and in-laws.  A note about cook time - we tried the ham after 5 hours and it was done at that time (had been cooking on low).  Just turned it to "warm" setting until all the sides were ready.  It was great to have the oven free for the casserole dishes and the slow cooker ham made the house smell incredible.   A great (and ridiculously easy) recipe.

I made this with a spiral cut honey cured ham. I followed the recipe, but also added a can of crushed pineapple with juice. (I usually follow recipes to a T when I first try them, but I just HAVE to have pineapple with my ham!) lol
Anyway, I cooked it on low for 4 hours (which is plenty for a cooked ham) and it absolutely fell apart, it was so tender and juicy. My house smelled wonderful and my family was asking me every five minutes when dinner would be. This is a keeper! So easy, juicy and delicious!!
Oh, and settle down Cademsee! If you don't like sugar added to recipes, then don't add it. Some of us (most of us!) are okay with it, so you can hop down off of your high horse and repeat after me "to each his own, to each his own . . ."

Great way to use a picnic ham.  I used a 3.75 lb ham with one C. brown sugar and 1/4 oj and 1/4 water.  I cooked it on low for about 4 hours.  It was very flavorful and quite moist.

Has anyone tried this recipe but coated the ham with prepared mustard & then the brown sugar? It's also good if you can add some cloves to this - either whole or ground.

Great Recipe! I added a couple of pineapples slices and the juice. This came out great, the only bad part was that I chose a spiral cut ham and the ham was so tender it was hard to take out of the cooker with out pieces of it falling apart, but that was my error and not the fault of the recipe.

I was nervous about this. I'm not a great cook to start with and cooking for a large family made me extra paranoid. My first ham ever, and everyone was looking at me funny when I decided to use the crock pot. I had no idea what a picnic ham was, and was really nervous about not following the directions exactly, but very glad I followed my instinct. I used a typical ham bought at the grocery store - bone-in, cured, smoked, precooked. I cooked mine for about 3 hours (9ish pound ham) on low(which was about the time it would have taken in the oven). It was perfect. Juicy and moist. I was sure to baste the ham a bunch (maybe once or twice each hour). Because my ham stuck out a bit on the crock pot, I had to use a tin foil tent (which also made me nervous). It worked great. Put a few layers on there to make sure the moisture didn't escape. 

I got SO many compliments - some even saying it was the best ham they'd ever had which is SUCH a compliment considering my level of expertise on things like this!

I did add a little pineapple juice, but that was probably not necessary. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

I use this recipe all the time now with a spiral ham. My family loves it in the crockpot much better than oven cooking. 
I place a piece of tinfoil tent over the ham then place the crockpot cover on and let and when we are ready for dinner it's nice and hot and so moist.  

I do add some OJ to the Brownsugar and it adds some extra flavor!! Give it a try!!

This ham turned out really great, but I had the same problem as others: The ham bone kept the lid from going all the way on.  I have the largest Crock-Pot on the market, so I'm not sure how others managed to get their 8 pound, bone-in picnic ham all the way in.  No worries though...I just used foil to "seal" the edges, and all was well.  I also added pineapple like others suggested.  I don't think it needed it, but it was a nice addition.

I really enjoyed this ham.  I used a 6 pound ham.  I had read that some people had found it dry so I put mine in the crockpot frozen.  It added some extra mosture.  I cooked it for the same amount of time the recipie called for.  It was moist and falling apart.  It was sweet and perfect.  I will add this to my families favorites.

I used a 10lb spiral ham, 2 cups of brown sugar and a can of pineapple rings. Mixed 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar with the juice from the pineapples in the bottom of the crock pot. Put ham in and Poured the Pineapples on top. Cooked for 4 hours and It was excellent.

I love this easy and delicious way to make ham!  It always comes out so incredibly tender and juicy.  Sometimes I add a little pineapple juice if I have it on hand.  Using the crockpot frees up my oven for side dish cooking on holidays.  Thanks so much!

This turned out fantastic!  I was a little nervous not adding liquid but since I was going to be home while it was cooking I took the chance, and it was great!  The juices from the ham quickly adding enough liquid to the pot.  I had about a 4lb smoked ham so I used half the brown sugar and cooked for about 4 hrs on low. Someone said not to use smoked ham but I cannot see why, it turned out great! This added a nice delicious sweetness to ham but nothing overpowering at all.  Will definitely be making my hams like this from now on.  Thanks for the great super easy recipe!!

I made this ham for sunday dinner.  My mother in-law and children loved it.  I did it with a 10 pound spiral ham.  I placed flat side down and put in the brown sugar.  I cooked it for about 3 to 4 hours.  I am going to make it again for a sunday dinner.  I had misplaced the recipe and looked for an hour trying to remember where I got the recipe.  That is how much my family and myself loved it.

I made this ham for my Christmas dinnner.  I will say first of all, I will never cook ham any other way...it was excellent!!! I was a bit concerned about not adding any water in the beginning, but I'm glad I stuck to the directions and didn't...it made it's own juices (which I spooned over the slices when it was done).
The only difference in the recipe was I used an 8 lb. boneless 1/2 ham which was completely smoked and cured. 
My family loved it and as the leftovers were used up..the ham was still moist and flavorful even when reheated and used in scalloped potatoes and also for breakfast ham and eggs.
We definitely give this a 5 star rating!!

Tastes the same, was a little more moist, but just as good as any other ham done in the oven. I did love the ease of warming it up in the crock pot so the oven stays open for other items.

There are so many kinds of hams. The recipe should specify if the ham is cooked or uncooked. It would save alot time reading all these reviews to find out what to buy.

Just took this out of the crock pot and it's very good.  My only complaint would be that I wish I had seasoned it a little bit, aside from the brown sugar.

I think it's important for people to note that a picnic ham is not a true ham, like what you'd typically have at Easter or Christmas.  Those come from the butt of the pig.  A picnic ham is the pigs shoulder and much more like pork than ham (it's also known as pork shoulder)...great for pulled pork sandwiches:)  I can see that 8 hours for a true ham may dry it out but for a large picnic ham, 8 hours was perfect for mine.

I was surprised at how good this was!  I had company over last weekend and used them as guinnea pigs since I wanted to use this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I used a spiral ham (couldn't find a picnic ham at my local grocer), and followed the rest of the recipe, adding clovers and pineapple as suggested by others.  This came out GREAT!  My husband had several helpings (and leftovers for the next several days), my guests had multiple helpings, and took home quite a bit for the next few days as well.  It was a hit!  When I asked what they would change since it was a new recipe, I was told "NOTHING"!  I'm making it again for Thanksgiving and excited to be able to offer another entree that doesn't require my oven.

Looking at what other reviewers were saying about what type of ham to to buy and what not to buy, I was a little nervous.  I bought a 7 lb spiral cut ham.  Used the brown sugar and a can of pineapple.  I cooked it for 6 hours and covered it with foil.  It was perfect.  All the juices cooked around it.  It was a huge hit!

Perfect.  I am not a big ham lover but after this I am a convert.  After all the reviews this is what I did.  I used a crock pot bag to seal all the goodness in.  Same recipe but all nice and sealed up.  Helped make it real juicy for all cuts of ham.  Easy clean up as well.  I drained pineapple and added it to the top as not to add any more juice.  It makes enough in the crock pot all day.

I make a paste to rub all over the ham before slow cooking. I mix brown sugar, ground mustard, and a bit of horseradish. Dribble Coca cola (or cola flavored product) into the dry ingredients until you form a paste. Rub this mixture all over the ham.  Cooking time depends on the size of the ham.  Most recently, I had a 6.5 pound ham and cooked it on low for 7 hours. Perfect! Do not add salt to the recipe b/c ham is salty in the first place plus the sodium in the cola enhances the salty flavor. Enjoy!

I made this for Christmas Eve. I just didn't think there would be any liquid using the recipe as written so I added a can of pineapple chunks with the juice. I was...oh this hurts...WRONG! The good news is- after de-greasing, & reducing, I had a nice sauce...but there were some scary OMG moments when I thought it was gonna overflow.

This was so easy to put together, the slow cooker did all the work. I loved it. This was the first time I didn't have to carve it b/c the ham was so tender it fell apart. I was a little skeptical about not putting any liquid in it but boy was I surprised when at the end the crock pot was filled to the top with juice. It left the meat nice and juicy.

I usually cook my ham like this all the time except I ADD: cloves, pineapple w/ a little juice, marshiano cherries w/ a little juice, & a little gingerale. You could even sprinkle a little cinnamon.

This is a remarkably simple and yet incredibly tasty preparation for ham.  The kids LOVE it.  Use a fully cooked (smoked) ham, DO NOT use a fresh ham.  I used an 8 lb. butt portion.  I had to slice a chunk off to make it fit, but even the small chunk tasted great after 8 hours on low, and I thought that would be overcooked.  The juice from the ham keeps everything moist.  If you use the right type of ham you can't go wrong.  We'll be having this for Easter.

Fantastic! My boyfriend said this was the best ham he'd ever eaten. I added some ground cloves, ground ginger, dry mustard and orange zest to the brown sugar which made it taste a bit like a cumberland sauce. 
This is the only way I want to make ham ever again!

This recipe is easy and results are excellent. I want to thank Littlemstxthang for the wonderful recipe. I read MANY of the reviews and don't understand why many cooks had so many problems.Here's what I did. I bought a regular bone in ham at the market. Mine was a 6.5 pound, Cook's brand, shank, smoked ham. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I was afraid that the brown sugar in the bottom of the pan would burn. I added about a half cup of pineapple juice on the bottom.  I put the ham in cut side down. My ham fit perfectly in my slow cooker. I put the lid on and turned it on low.  In my Crock Pot, the low setting allows me to choose either 6 hours or 8 hours. I don't really trust the slow cooker so I don't leave home while it's on. I cooked my ham for about 5 hours. And I basted it periodically.  It made lots of juice while it cooked. It turned out tender and tasty. I love the idea that you can make a ham without using the oven. So, it worked out well for me even though I never left home.  I will certainly make my hams this way in the future. I was very happy with it. Thanks also to all of the reviewers as I picked up lots of good tips from you.

I used other raters suggestions to modify for a fully cooked spiral sliced boneless ham. Put about a cup of brown sugar in bottom of crock pot, added ham on top and rubbed outside of ham with the glaze seasoning that came with the ham. Covered tightly (using foil if necessary) and put on low for 2 to 3 hrs (depending on size of ham). Even my husband who typically doesn't care for ham loves it made this way.

I bought a five pound hickory smoked ham and put it in the crockpot with 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar for about three hours.  I covered it with foil before I put the lid on as another reviewer suggested and it was perfect!  That's how I'll fix ham from now on!

OMG...This was so good. I cooked it over night and woke up to the sweet smell of this ham. The only thing I did was add a bit of water so it didnt dry. It came out moist and juicy. My husband was picking at it before we all sat down for dinner. This was my first time and I will always make this ham for some kind of special occasion...1 thing I lined my slow cooker with foil. It made the clean up very easy. Try it you'll like it. THANKS for the recipe...

Wonderful method!  There was no problem adding the sugar dry, as a previous reviewer noted... the ham adds its own juices.  I'll be using this one again!

I do this same recipe except I pack the brown sugar on top of the ham, and then pour some maple syrup on top of that. It melts on the ham and creates a delicious glaze. I add a little water to the bottom of the crock, which creates a juice to pour over the ham and mashed potatoes.

I made this for a church social and will use this every time from now on.  How easy and tasty!  I had a 10lb ham and turned it after about 2 hours and the meat just fell off the bone.  I cooked it on low for 5 hours but actually should have turned it off at 4 hours.  Everyone at church loved it!

This Ham was amazing! I made it for Thanksgiving along with a turkey and the ham was gone first. I had many compliments and everyone was amazed when I told them how easy it was. It really was so moist and flavorful that it felt apart in your mouth. I will be making this ham again for Easter.

I am a college student and I made this recipe for a Thanksgiving dinner I was invited to. ALL the guys were RAVING about this ham - it was border-line embarassing! I followed the recipe exactly. It was so tender I had to carve it while still in the crockpot. :) Now I have gained a reputation for having supernatural cooking skills! Not bad. :)

I want to warn you to make sure you buy a CURED picnic ham. I tried the same recipe for Christmas but bought an uncured ham by accident. It came out not pink, but white, like a pork chop. Still tasty, but not amazing.

This was the easiest ham recipe I have ever used and the result was fantastic.I used a 3 lb. boneless spiral cut. I was a little scared that the sugar would burn so I added 2 tbsp. of water, but I probably didn't need to. There was tons of sugary juice and I didn't even have leftovers. Next time I'll use a larger ham. Delicious.

I used a spiral ham from Costco, 1 20 oz can of sliced pineapple, & 1 C dark brown sugar.  
Lay the pineapple slices down on the bottom of the slow cooker, place 1/2 cup of brown sugar on top of the pineapple, put the ham (flat side down) on top of the sugar.  Pour the pineapple juice that's left over in the can from the sliced pineapples on top of the ham, then cover with the rest of the brown sugar.  I cooked it on LOW for 3 hours.  It was the best ham I'd ever cooked.

I made this for a work potluck with a precooked  spiral sliced ham, and everyone loved it. I put the 6.5 lb ham in a 6qt oval slow cooker, flat side down, on top of 4-5 pineapple rings, rubbed it with the brown sugar, and poured the rest of the juice from the can of pineapple in the bottom of the crock.  I cooked on low for 4-5 hours (there was a blown circuit in there for a bit, so I don't know exact time).  It was very moist, and standing in about half crock of liquid.  I am going to cook it the same way for the family at Christmas.

Very easy and frees up the oven.  The spiral cut dryed out a bit for me but was still good.

AWESOME!!!  I used a 8 lb hickory smoked butt ham.  After reading some reviews i was worried that the ham would turn really dark for being smoked and would dry out.  I cooked mine for 5 1/2 hours and everything was perfect.  I was able to get nice slices, wasn't dark, and wasn't dry.  The bottom part of the ham and where the juice reached was a little darker but still looked like a ham and tastes SOOO good.  The sweetness was just right, I didn't use the extra juice but i might try it next time. It probably could have cooked a little bit longer and would have been fine too. I used tin foil to cover the top and put the lid on, then tied a rope around the tin foil to not let any heat escape.

This was outstanding! I added about a cup of orange juice with the brown sugar to the bottom of the cooker. Then spread the rest of the brown sugar on top of the ham. I also used a 9lb spiral sliced ham and cooked it on low heat for about 5hrs. Turned out amazing. The meat was super moist and had a wonderful flavor all the way through. I will never cook my ham any other way. With the slow cooker the flavors permeate every part. Happy happy happy!

I just made this over the weekend for a thanksgiving dinner open house.  I had 14 people and they all loved it.  There is no way to go wrong with this receipe.  My first ham - and a success.  I too was hesitant that there was no liquid but it sure made alot of its own jucies.  I did add the pinapple slices and a tad bit of the juice and when it was ready I served it with a side of the receipe on here called Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce which complimented it very well.

This is probably the best ham recipe I've ever made.  I made it for New Years and then again for Easter (two different crowds).  Both times the ham was too big to fit in my crock pot, so I just tucked it in and then encased the entire top in foil.  The first time I made this, I cooked for 10 hours; this latest time I cooked it for 8.  Both hams were excellent, although I think I preferred the longer cook time.  The second time I used an applewood smoked ham and it turned out beautifully - I'm unsure as to why one reviewer said not to get a smoked ham.  Mine was fabulous.  I've already had a request to make this again for Christmas.  :)  Aside from personal taste, there's really no reason to deviate from the beautiful simplicity of this recipe!

Whether I'm cooking for a crowd at the holidays or just our family, this is my favorite ham recipe!  I use a bone-in shank half, usually over ten pounds (and always on sale, LOL!)  I follow the recipe and also drizzle maple syrup over the top.  Tightly cover the crock pot with foil (the lid won't fit) and DO NOT COOK FOR MORE THAN FIVE HOURS ON LOW.  If you cook this ham for the full amount of time, it becomes brown and pulls away from the bone (not very appetizing.)  At five hours, the ham is gorgeous, moist and delicious!

This is a good recipe, but I want to warn people not to overcook the ham.  I think the cooking time is too long for this recipe.  I would cut it down by two hours (check for doneness of course).  Otherwise this is a good, easy recipe.  Enjoy.

ham.  After reading another reviewer's comments I placed the ham cut side down and cook on low for 4-5 hours.  It came out perfect

I used this recipe exactly as it is written.  I felt uneasy about the fact that it had no liquid, but I should not have.  The ham created its own liquid and this was THE BEST HAM EVER!  I will  never cook another ham in the oven.  One note:  In my crockpot on low, it did take my 8-lb ham longer than 8 hours to achieve perfection, and I never lifted the lid.  I would say it took 9.5 hours, so please know that cooking times can vary.

This is just excellent! Followed the recipe exactly, except I used a 7.5 pound butt portion ham. I put in the (large!) crock on low just before I went to bed on Saturday night, then turned it off when I got up in the morning. Left it in the crock until noon and it was still warm. Not great for slicing for sandwiches though---it just falls apart. I won't be baking hams in the oven anymore. Not only does this taste sooo much better, but I also don't heat up my kitchen with the heat from the oven. Definitely on my Sunday dinner rotation from now on!

This was sooo good! The brown sugar glaze/juice that it creates is excellent for dipping the ham in when eating.

 Used a Smoked Picnic Ham (Pork Shoulder) just shy of 6-1/2 lbs, in a 6 qt crockpot, and it was just the right size and came out very tender and tasty. May try a spiral sliced ham next time...but am guessing that an actual ham may dry out easier since it has less fat than the picnic ham.

Uncooked, bone-in butt end ham is my choice for the BEST ham dinner ever! Have been cooking it this way for years but with a little less brown sugar (personal taste). If the ham is purchased fully cooked it will only require 3 to 4 hours or so to heat up.

4 hours on low was enough time.  1 cup brown sugar was enough sweetness.  Great easy recipe that produces a moist ham.

This was so good.  I was so doubtful about the two ingredients only thing...but it was SOOO good!  I did add about 1/4 water, but that was it.  I cooked it for 8 hours on low...and I did buy a fully cooked picnic shoulder ham.  It fell off the bones at the end because it was so tender.  It wasn't too sweet, either...just right!

I love this recipe.  I used to cook my ham in the oven on low for several hours but this is the best.  I added a can of crushed pineapple along with the brown sugar and this made it even better.  In fact, I won't be going back to the the oven.

Excellent, hard to believe it works with only two ingredients.  I did add a little grainy dijon mustard just because.  The juice from the ham is delicious, really good with grits.  I used a 6lb ham butt and it was done in about 5.5 hours.

After discovering this recipe a couple of years ago, I wouldn't dream of cooking a ham any other way during the busy holidays. My family calls ahead to make sure my "crockpot" ham will be on the menu! Now, I even have most of my friends cooking their hams this way! Most of the time, I don't even bother with the brown sugar, I just drop that baby in and let it roll! De-li-cious!!!

I am one of the biggest ham lovers ever.  My family does not care for ham, so usually twice a year I buy a ham (and a turkey for them).  I look forward to this treat.  I freeze left overs and enjoy for the next few months.  That was not the case with this ham.  I was able to stomach it for dinner but ended up throwing the rest of the ham away.  I will not make this recipie again.  Overcooked and very unusual taste. This is the first review that I've given that has not been 5 stars!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone could not shut up about how wonderful it was! It was melt in your mouth delicious and I can't believe how easy it was to make. It just fell apart. Had to put it on a serving tray because you couldn't carve it, it just fell apart. Everyone kept asking how I made it. Definately a keeper and will make again.

This recepie makes am incredibly tender, yummy ham that can be made by anyone at anytime. I combined the ham and sugar the night before, and kept it in the fridge until I was ready to start it in the morning before classes, and it turned out just fine. Thanks so much!

Performs a miracle on pressed hams!
If you're like me, you're not overly fond of "pressed hams"; they're so packed with water that regardless of how much time you give it in the oven, it still slices in a strange, unnatural, deli-meat style.
This method turns them into real meat! The meat almost becomes "flaky", and the water disappears.  It leaves a really nice tasting ham.  
I DID NOT add the brown sugar at all...we're consuming too much sugar already people! I popped a frozen large ham in my slow cooker, for 4 hours on low to thaw it, and then finished it with another 4 hours on high.  No need to add water...there's plenty already in the ham.

I used a smoked spiral cut ham both times I used this recipe.  The first time I just put ham and brown sugar in the crock pot, for about 2 1/2 hours (my pot heats very slowly), and it was a hit.  The second time, I only used 1 cup of brown sugar, placed slices of fresh pineapple on top of the ham and on the bottom of the cooker and did the same with cloves.  As soon as the brown sugar melted, I basted it every 30 minutes, if I was in the kitchen anyway, to make sure the pineapple and clove flavor permeated the meat.  This one got RAVE reviews from the carnivores in the crowd and there were no leftovers.  Even the vegetarian cook thought it smelled heavenly.

Made this for a large dinner along with a turkey and the turkey was barely touched but this ham was devoured! Nothing was left and everybody loved it. Super easy to make and it tastes wonderful.

This was great,  So simple and falling off the bone.  My ham did not fit in the crockpot with the lid on it, I put foil over it and cooked on low for 4 hours.  I will definitely make it again.
Thanks for a simple and tasty dish.

Followed the instructions, but I used a spiral sliced, fully-cooked ham and put in the slow cooker at low for 5 hrs. Tasted okay, except it was very dried out. I read a lot of reviews to help me decide on how long to cook it and if there was anything special to do with the type of ham I used. Plenty of reviews, but still didn't make me 100% sure it would turn out well.  Now I know. Will not use this method again. I gave it 3 stars for ease of prep and only slightly embarrassing me in front of my family.  Should have gone with the Honey Glazed Ham recipe.

We make ham this way on holidays because it is so easy and it frees up the oven to bake other things.  Don't make ham soup with the leftovers though because it make an awful sweet ham soup.

Great - I had a spiral cut pre-glazed, pre-cooked.  followed directions, but only left in for 4 hours.  Moist, tender, delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing! I have used a couple different cuts of pork and they all turn out amazing! Such a simple recipe, it almost seems embarassing to tell people about it! I dont add any water, as the sugar and fat turn into a delicious (not-so-healthy) sauce. Each different type of meat and size needs a little bit different cooking time. Keep an eye on it after 3 hours if you are using a pre-cooked, smaller cut. Delicious!!!

I followed this recipe very loosley and it came out great!  I didn't measure the brown sugar; just rubbed it in and sprinkled some underneath .  I had to trim my 10 pound ham considerably to get it in, then found the bone prevented the lid from fitting on completely.  Oh no!  Now what do I do?  Well, I covered the ham with foil, then put on the lid and covered IT with foil on all sides to seal.  It worked perfectly!  Started the crockpot on high for 1 hour, then turned it down for about 4 hours til we were ready for dinner.  So so good, and left my oven free for heating appetizers and, later, all of my side dishes.  Thanks for the idea!!

I was a little apprehensive at first because I did not want to ruin an expensive ham. I used a smoked butt ham from the grocery store. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out SO good! I still wonder where all the liquid came from because I know I didn't add any. This will be my only ham recipe from now!

Maybe the key to having it stay moist is NOT to use a spiral ham.  Even on low for 4 hours,(as others suggested), I wish it came out juicier.  But, no one complained and it was easy, especially when you are trying to cook and entertain at the same time.  If I do try it again I will use an UNCUT, whole bone-in ham.

WOW!  I did the ham for an early Thanksgiving feast this year and needed the oven to bake the pies.  So, I decided to give this recipe a try.  It was still a bit frozen so I put it in the crock pot the night before.  I put cloves and pineapples in the crockpot, as the reviews stated and forgot about it.  By the time dinner was served, it was sooo jucy that it was falling off the bone!  We didn't even have to cut it and it was absolutely delicious!  There were not any left overs.  My mother even wanted the recipe and said that she never thought to cook a ham in the crock pot!  Thanks sooo much for the recipe!  I'll be doing this again and again and again!

I have used many recipes from this site, but this is the first time I have rated one.  This is the best way to cook a ham.  You have to remember that if you don't have an extremly large crock pot, it might not work for the size ham you want to prepare.  I bought a 6.43 lb ham and it fit perfect in my crock pot.  I was only having a total of 5 of us for Easter dinner so I didn't need a huge ham.  After I placed the ham into the crock pot and added the additional brown sugar,  I cut up a quarter of an onion, just big pieces, added that then aquirted some dijon mustard on top of the ham.  And I also scored and clove studded it.  Cooked for about 6 hours and was the most fabulous ham ever.  I will never bake a piece of ham like that again.

My experience with cooking large chunks of meat in the slow cooker has not always been positive-- I was nervous about too many fatty juices collecting at the bottom and soaking into the ham.  However, I went ahead since all the reviews were so good, and I have to agree with them.  Why make ham any other way?  It came out tender, moist, and delicious.  In the future, I may play with this a bit -- maybe add cloves, pineapples, molasses, for different flavors.  Thank you for this great and easy way to make a ham!

This was the best ham I have ever made. I will never have another ham from the oven. I followed the recipe as stated and used a spiral sliced boneless ham. Delicious! :-)

I recently made this recipe and thought it was great. It's difficult to adjust large recipes down to two even with the ability to change the servings..I usually buy a honey smoked sliced ham and divide it into enough slices for 3 meals.  One to cook and freeze the other two. I used about 2/3 cup of brown sugar on the bottom of my small slow cooker and 3 or 4 tablespoons on the rest of the ham.. I drained a can of peach halves and arranged them around the ham and cooked it on low for 2 hours. My husband and I thought it was outstanding.

I made this recipe a few months ago and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it (I watched everyone go back for more and more helpings). I made the recipe exactly as is and added the pineapple per the video. I used toothpicks to secure the pineapple slices to the ham.  My ham was not store-bought; it was from a pig we butchered, so I'm not sure of the size, but it was a huge ham. The lid did not fit, so I had to use aluminum foil over the top. It was done in 6 hrs. I left the cooker on warm till serving time. The ham was very moist and there was a lot of juice in the pot. By special request I'm making this ham again this week for the 4th of July potluck we're having.  I'm giving this recipe five stars for its simplicity and taste.

This was INCREDIBLE!  5.5 lb bone-in ham, 1 Tbsp brown sugar dissolved in 1/2 cup microwaved water, cooked on low for 1 hour per lb or 5.5 hours, basted and flipped once. PERFECT.  Tender and moist thru and thru. DELICIOUS. Dark bark on the outside, pink on the inside.  BEAUTIFUL.  Measured nearly a quart of juice after cooking. EXCELLENT! I'm stocking up on hams at Xmas prices to tweak the basic recipe with some of the suggestions here.

this is the only way i cook hams now. Mine was spiral already cooked so just put on high for 30 minutes and turned to low for about 2 hours - until we were ready to eat. I actually just put ham in crockpot, poured in 2 cans of chicken broth. Opened pineapple slices put them around and poured half of the pineapple juice - used the rest to baste while it cooked. and put about 1/2 cup of brown sugar around and over the ham. Delicious And easy - can't beat that! Plus it is perfect for a big gathering because it remains hot the entire time. Only thing is for a spiral cut when serving you might want to turn it over - i had people trying to cut it on the butt end while in crockpot.

This was amazing as written.  I had a 9.5 lb ham, bone in.  Trimmed off a section to make it fit in the crock pot, I just covered the top of the ham with 1cup brown sugar, covered it tightly with tin foil (the ham was too big to allow the lid to fit properly).  It cooked for about 8hrs on low.  It was so tender, so moist and tasted go good - as long as I can fit my ham in the crock pot I won't cook it any other way in future - although I will try using the full 2c br. sugar to see if it's necessary.

I rub brown sugar on the ham and put some on the bottom of the crock pot (to taste). Then score in a diamond shape, put whole cloves in the score randomly (per taste) and use toothpicks to hold pineapple rings and cherries on. Put it in the crock pot and pore 3 or 4 single serving size cans of pineapple juice in. During cooking, I baste the ham 3 or 4 times. It comes out so juicy and flavorful.

I made this recipe for a family gathering,did everything to a tee, but i did add a can of pineapple chunks, cooked on low for 4 1/2 hrs, turned out awesome, my husband loved it, and he's picky. I will definately make this again, and the same way. I wont change anything.

This recipe is Divine!!! I made it for my in-laws & they were raving about it. I followed the recipe as stated but on the top of the ham i poured honey so the brown sugar would stick & I also poured pineapple juice in with it. It was great!!!

This was the easiest ham I have every done, and was excellent in taste and tenderness. My husband decided that he wanted ham along with the turkey I was cooking for our Canadian Thanksgiving this past weekend, so I found an 8 pound bone-in ham and threw it in the crockpot as per this recipe! The juice of the ham and the brown sugar turned into a great bubbling sauce that enveloped the ham beautifully! Everyone loved it, I looked like I was an amazing cook for getting both on the table! Thanks for a simple and great recipe!

OVERCOOKED!!!!!  I would cut the cooking time in half. I had an eight plus pound ham that I pulled out of the slow cooker with an hour plus to go, It was overcooked. Even the  center was over done.

I bought a spiral sliced ham and was anxious to try this recipe. I cooked it for only 6 hours, but noticed that there was a lot of liquid in the pot, even though I didn't use any. Well, I realized that the reason there was so much liquid in there, is because the cooking drew every bit of moisture from the ham and dried it out so badly that it was tough and very dry and even broke up into little tiny pieces! I could only salvage a little meat around the bone which I made into Navy bean soup. (That was good!) It was an expensive $59 Christmas Dinner disaster! Maybe I used the wrong type of ham, I don't know, (The recipe doesn't say not to.) but I do know I'll never cook a spiral sliced ham this way again!

This is by far....the BEST ham and EASIEST that I have ever made! I buy a Kentucky Legend ham (usually find it at price chopper in Kansas City or Walmart Super Center) - I have only used Kentucky Legend, so I cannot speak for any other brand of ham. Occasionally, if I have the little "single serving fruit cups" like pears or peaches, I will add the juice from one of those just for something extra, however - it's perfect as it is.  My kids fight over it and my finicky 76 yr-old-father asks for it all the time - he insists on my bringing it for Thanksgiving and any other family get-together.  This recipe is a STAPLE and a keeper in our house!

I tried this recipe when a small get-together turned into a huge Easter/birthday party and I had one day to prepare. This ham was the hit of the party and every single person who had any wanted to know my "secret." I was concerned about not adding liquid in the beginning but believe me, there is no need. This comes out juicy and delicious. If the ham is a little large for your slow cooker, cover the top of the crock pot with foil and set the lid on top of that, like another reviewer and I both did. The only drawback I found to this recipe is that you won't have any leftovers.

I wasn't expecting much of this recipe, since there are only two ingredients, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I used a spiral cut, honey cured ham and cooked on low for about 6 hours (it probably could've come out sooner, but the rest of the food wasn't ready).  And I really liked that this uses the slow cooker and frees up the oven for other things.

Easy and the ham came out excellent, melt in your mouth yummy.  I used a 10lb ham butt, bone in, I shaved off a little to make it fit in the crock pot.  The only thing I did differently was the cook time. I cooked it 5 hours total, about an 1-1 1/2 on high and the rest of the time on low.

This was easy and I love the idea of using the slow cooker especially in the summer time.  It will also come in handy during the holidays when the oven may also be busy with other things.  I added bit of orange juice in the bottom of the slow cooker.  Next time I will definitely put some cloves on the ham.  I think 1 hour per pound is a good judge of the amount of time you will need on Low.

Oh my God I love this ham!!!! It is absolutely true that the two ingredients alone make the tastiest sweet & salty ham you've ever had. Slice it up in different size pieces for serving and everyone is beyond pleased. Leftovers for sandwiches and breakfasts are always still juicy and do not host the dried out residual flavor that a spiral or pre-cooked ham typically do. You cannot go wrong with this recipe and serving options are unlimited - casseroles, breakfast side, sandwiches, main dish, and cold snack. My family loves to experiment with different gourmet mustards although no condiment is necessary. A hearty dijon seems to be a favorite.

Awesome!  I used a no bone, sliced package of Kentucky ham that you buy near the bacon and hot dogs. I think it was called picnic ham or serving platter ham  There was about 2 pounds in this package. I threw in the ham and a couple handfuls of brown sugar (did not even measure) and put it on low for about 3 hours  THATS ALL THE TIME YOU NEED DO NOT OVERCOOK OR YOUR HAM WILL BE TOUGH AND YOUR LEFTOVERS WILL BE WORTHLESS AND CHEWY!!!! 

YUMMMMMMMMYYYYYYY!!  My husband loved :) We ate it on sandwiches the next day, a Ham Egg and Cheese buscuit for beakfast and I chopped up the veeeery last bit and added it to the Delicious Ham and Potato Soup form this site!!  yumm yummmm

I used a smoked picnic ham.  To the brown sugar I added bourbon, allspice and orange juice and boiled it up on the stove to cook off the alcohol.  I let that cool and poured it over the ham.  This was amazing and easy.

In the words of Rachael Ray... "YUMMO". Not only have I never made a ham before but I don't even like ham! I got one free for the holidays so I decided to try it out. I was a little hesitant since there was no liquid in the recipe but I read the other reviews and realized that the ham produces alot of juices. I was also nervous because I could not make it fit into my crockpot because of the bone. I covered it with foil and prayed it cooked! Despite the reviews, I did get the smoked ham (again because it was free). Well let me tell you...I can't stop eating it! It is so moist and tasty!! I can't wait to make it again! I have a new great crockpot recipe...thanks!

OMG...I don't know what I did wrong but this was a disaster for me! I could only find a 4 lb picnic ham so I cut the cooking time in 1/2 like someone else's review said to do. After 4 hours, it was still only 140 degrees with the meat thermometer which which was about medium rare! I tried to salvage dinner by putting it in the oven covered for a few minutes and it came out overcooked and tough. What a waste of time and money. I was so excited because of the great reviews but I would do a trial run of it first. This was my Christmas dinner...luckily only me and my dad eating it!

I think I read every review on this before attempting to make it. I dont know why I was so worried. It turned out absolutely fabulous! I left it cooking while at work all day! I only basted it upon arriving home. It was so moist and cooked perfectly. The 8 pound size was ideal. I will utlize this recipe forever

Soooo easy and soooo delicious!  At first, I was hesitant to leave the crockpot on with no liquid but I had nothing to worry about.  I came home and the juices from the ham and the sugar made a delicious sauce, easy to thicken for a glaze.  Perfect!

Fair.  If someone gave me a ham I would probably prepare it this way again.  However, I won't go drop the money on one just for this.  For some reason we just weren't as impressed as the reviews led me to believe we'd be.  :-(

This was EXCELLENT.  I accidentally bought a bone in, spiral cut ham (didn't know they had those) and it was a little overdone, but excellent, excellent taste!  I made the bean soup with the bone afterwards.  Delicious.

This is easy, and good. Make sure you have a large slow cooker, or be prepared to slice off a portion of the top. If there's a lot of visible fat on the ham, slice off as much as possible. This makes a lot!

I made this ham for the first time for our Christmas eve dinner--I can't begin to tell you how amazingly wonderful it was! I had an Organic 8.5 lb. spiral sliced ham and slow-cooked it for about 7 hours. Have never baked a ham in crockpot before--now it's the only thing I'll do in the future! Only thing I did different was add a tad of pineapple juice around the ham and brown sugar- and lightly sprinkled the ham with ground cloves. So, so juicy and fall apart good!!! Thank you for sharing! ?

I also add a 1/3 cup of apple cider vinegar keeps the ham tender and adds a rich apple flavor.

I will NEVER bake ham in the oven again. NEVER! Seeing was believing when it came to how juicy this ham was. The crockpot (with the ham still in it) was probably 1/3 full of juice. I always bag up the leftovers into individual size portions and vacuum seal the packages. I added juice to each package to ensure that in the months to come, the ham would be as juicy as the day I made it. So easy. So delicious!

I have made this ham many times and everyone loves it!  So easy and tastes so good. The ham just falls apart and has a great brown sugar ham flavor.  I always buy the "ready to cook" hams during holidays and I have never had any problems.  For larger hams just cover crockpot with heavy duty foil.  I generally cook 11 or 12 lbs in about 8 hours.

I just gotta tell you! My Shank Ham was too big for my Slow Cooker, it was 12lbs instead of 10 and much too wide! I did everything in preparation to the letter then put it in a Lge Roaster and baked it at 300 for 3.5 hours basting every 30mins... Knockout Impression!

Last year's ham counter oven attempt (in a roaster) did not go very well at all so I was a bit hesitant to try again.  But I got a late start this year for Turkey day and oven space and time were at a premium, with the Turkey being a hog, so I decided to try a different route, and boy am I glad I did.  I followed this recipe for the most part, without strict measurements and with a couple modifications. 

Because I too, like some of the other reviewer's, was concerned about the lack of water, and had some prior success with beer as a tenderizer (in briskett and ham)...

I opted to toss half a bottle of beer in the pot.  I didn't put the brown sugar on the bottom because of that so I just packed it all around the outside of the ham.  I cooked it on low, overnight for about 8 hours. Hands down, this was the best ham we have ever had - better than honey baked. We had one for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and now New years.

It doesn't get any better than this!  We always use a bone-in ham and add a can of pineapple rings and juice.  The last time I made it I pulled the ham out after the eight-hour mark, separated the meat from the bone, shredded the meat, then returned it to the juices in the slow cooker for another short time.  This made the juiciest ham yet! When we took it to Christmas dinner the family divided it up between them, so it looks like I have to make another one for myself.  This has turned what I always perceived as a special occasion food into something we will enjoy often.  Now I have only to be ashamed of spending three digit sums on pre-made holiday hams when a better one was within my reach for one-tenth of the price.

I'm actually a vegetarian, but made this for my family. It's insanely easy. I bought the picnic ham, uncooked with bone. It was too big for my crock pot.. about 8-9 lbs, so I just made a foil tent and covered it tightly with 2 layers of foil. I used the brown sugar as stated, plus I added pineapple rings at the bottom and ground clove rubbed in with the brown sugar. I cooked it on high for the first hour or two and then I brought it down to low. It took about 6.5 hours for the ham to be completely cooked (internal temperature of 160). Both my husband and my son said it was THE BEST ham they have ever eaten! It was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  I think I'm going to do this for Christmas for my meat eaters. It's a keeper!

Big Thanksgiving hit! I made a 7.3 pound ham shank and used brown sugar and Splenda blend (diabetic relative) along with a half can of pineapple tidbits and juice. Wow! The family raved over it. Definitely a keeper.

I read tons of the reviews and settled on a 9 lb spiral sliced, honey-cured ham.  Put brown sugar on it as directed, added pineapple rings and cloves, then sealed it in with foil since the cover didn't fit.  Cooked it 3.5 hours on low & slow then let it sit on "warm" for another 45 minutes.  It was overcooked, but still had a great flavor.  I will cut back to probably 2 hours next time, but will definitely make it again!  I also took another reviewer's recommendation to baste it with the juices periodically.  You do not need to add any liquid.  The ham produces plenty.

This was easy, cheap and delicious. I made several meals out of it. I cooked as suggested, but cooked on simmer for the 8 hours because my crockpot runs hot. Also, it's important to use a picnic ham and not a precooked ham like many people seem to have used.

My family really enjoyed this.  I've made it 4 times before reviewing.  The only alteration I've done is to follow the advice of another reviewer of using aluminum foil to cover the top of the ham and seal it in before putting the lid on.  Is soooo nice not to have to tie up my oven to bake the ham for large gatherings.  Will definitely be making this for many years to come.

I have never written a review on any recipe.  With this said I need to tell that I always read all review prior to testing a recipe.  I made this ham Sunday for Easter. I was very nervous because I had not tried it prior to serving it for a house full of family.  It was DELISH! moist and sliced very nicely for the holiday platter.  I used two 4 lb boneless hams in the same crock pot.  I put a cup of brown sugar on the bottom with a can of pineapple chunks.  I did put a little maple syrup on the ham and patted it down with brown sugar.  I basted the ham through the process.  Ham was ready to cut in five hours on low. I would agree with other reviews no need to ever do a ham in the oven again.

Everyone I served it to thought it was delicious, I did add about 1/2 cup of pineapple juice because I had it on hand. My ham was 5 lbs and it was cooked in 5 hours. If your ham needs to be cooked it will say so on the package and the cooking thermometer needs to reach 160 to be cooked. If it does not need to be cooked, it will only need to be heated through and may only take 3 hours, depending your particular slow cooker.

I was a little nervous about the amount of cook time, since I had a 5 lb. smoked butt ham and I read many reviews and came up with a 4 hr. cook time and the ham came out very moist. I did use 1 cup of brown sugar on the bottom, pineapple rings on top of the ham with the juice and 1/2 cup brown sugar mixed with 1/2 cup of orange juice and poured over the ham. I removed some of the juice and put it in a pot and added cornstarch to thicken it up and then basted over the ham. I was so surprised on how good it turned out. I will make ham again this way for sure. Update 12/29/12, made this for Christmas, used a 7lb. butt ham and cooked for 4 hrs. it was so moist everyone loved it. I'll only use this way to cook a ham and the flavor was outstanding!!

One reviewer warned against using a smoked ham, but that's what I used and we loved it. I added two cans of pineapple tidbits with the juice. Made this for an extended family get-together and it was a huge hit.

As with another reviewer, used small 2-3# precooked ham in my small crock. Had to cut some off to fit. Diced extra into cubes for a salad later. Punched some holes in ham to incorporate juice, added brown sugar, threw in some crushed pineapple, a squirt of honey and sprinkled on a small amount of ground cloves. 4-5 hours later, ham was caramelized and delicious! Leftovers should be great sliced thin for sandwiches!

Be sure to use a butt portion ham. Not shank, not smoked. It turns out great and practically falls apart. The juice it produces is great to pour over the ham also. Also good with pineapple added.

This turned out wonderfully!! The meat falls right off the bone! Although I did make the mistake of grabbing a pork shoulder picnic roast. But now we're having pulled pork sandwiches later this week! No loss here!

Awesome! So simple and easy...and it leaves the oven free for other things! I think it tasted just as good as an expensive honey baked ham using a .99 cent/lb ham.

I think everything has been said, but it's an amazing ham recipe. My kids devoured it and so did my hubby. I'm not a huge fan of ham, but WOW I loved this. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was the first time I have EVER made a ham. It was so good that I had a hard time not eating it while I was cutting it up. Actually I barely had to cut it because it was just falling apart. The husband loved it and we both can't wait to have leftovers in our lunch tomorrow!

It is hard to mess up a good slow cooked ham. I added a couple things to this recipe. Drizzled a little honey on, some Worcestershire sauce.

I loved doing my ham in the crockpot for Easter. It frees up the oven for the side dishes. I had a fully-cooked spiral sliced ham so I only was concerned about heating it up. I did not use the brown sugar as called for in this recipe. :-) Also, I did not use the glaze packet that came with the ham. I like to be able to use the leftover ham without the sweetness. I considered cooking up the glaze as directed and serving it separately, in a gravy boat, but didn't even do that! Has anybody ever done that? One year I made a pineapple sauce as a serve-with and that was great!

Caution, don't do what I did. I have used this recipe successfully a couple times with spiral cut hams.
This time I added a fresh pineapple and the juice. It was a rookie mistake, the enzymes in the fresh pineapple softened the ham and made some of the meat turn to mush.  At least the cat enjoyed the mushy part. I used a little orange juice previously and that was fine, but not necessarily. I think I will try a regular picnic ham the next time.

This is my new favorite ham recipe.  My family all loved it and it makes the most juicy, delicious ham. I used a smoked shank ham and cooked it for about 6 hours and it was perfect. I had to trim it a little to fit like a few others and it was fine. The juice went about 3/4 up the sides when it was done and  I put the juice in a saucepan, added  a 16 oz. can of pineapple slices with the juice and added several big squirts of spicy mustard to it and simmered it until it condensed and thickened for about 20-30 minutes. That made a great sauce for the ham. What a wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing it.

to cook a ham in a crock pot it doesn't have to completely fit.....if the lid won't fit, cover tightly with aluminum foil - works just like having the lid on

Ham don't fit. Trimming is silly, you lose the whole point of having a ham that's not already cut into sliced. Glaze needs less sweet, more tang. I supposed if you have a two-person ham it might be okay if you add some mustard to the glaze, but that's not the recipe.

Great results. I used a 7 lbs. pre-cooked spiral ham. Mixed the powdered glaze (the one that comes with the ham) with some brown sugar and used the powder mix as a rub.  Applied the rub to the ham the night before. Cooked it for 2 hrs in high,  always kept an eye on it since I didn't want to burn it.

I never cooked a ham, before this recipe. I should mention that I decided to do this Easter morning...and I had 5 unexpected guests! It was risky, but I went for it. Boy, am I glad I did. This was the best ham I have ever had. Everyone loved my ham! Now, I make this ham every two weeks. I did add something to it that the kids love. About 1 & 1/2 hours before it's done, I throw in a bag of baby carrots, for some delicious candied carrots!

Mmmm.  I used a 7-lb hickory smoked butt-portion ham.  Very tasty and not at all overcooked, even after 10 hours in the slow cooker.  Since inexpensive hams have quite a bit of water added prior to sale, I was not surprised to come home to a ham that was half-submerged in liquid.  In my opinion, this $15 ham is a darn good every-day substitute for the $50 Christmas butcher-shop ham.  Don't know what the family will think yet -- I had to write the review after snitching a little before dinnertime!

This is so good and so easy! I've made it twice using a sliced Smithfield ham and it wonderful. The 2nd time I sprinkled ground cloves on the sugar and used a can of pineapple chunks. When I reheated the leftovers, I added cornstarch to the liquid to make a gravy. Fabulous!

This is my favorite way to make ham using the brown sugar. Mine varies a little though as I add Coke and cook mine in the oven. I will try the crock pot next time. The best ham I made was made with flat (no fiz) coke and I cooked it on 250 in the oven for 8 hours. This ham was fall off the bone delicious. I usually cook it and go to bed but basting ocasionally would be best. The darker the meat the better, so full of flavor. My entire family loves when I make this.

Due to all rave reviews I tried this today.  I will not be making it again.  I bought the picnic cut and there is so much waste to it that there is hardly anything left after you get out the bone, the thick skin and the fat.  And way too much fat--meat was very greasy.  I have done leaner cuts and even boneless hams in the crockpot with a simple glaze that were way better than this

This recipe is so easy and makes the BEST HAM EVER!!!!!!  I did add a little orange juice to the brown sugar as someone else suggested.  This is the only way I will make a ham from now on.  Have made it twice already and it always comes out so moist.  Highly recommend this recipe!!

This dish was so easy to make.  I had only a 5 lb spiral ham so I cut down on the brown sugar.  That was a mistake.  I should have used the whole 2 cups.  I also added a can of chunk pineapple.  Cooked on low for 5 hours.  Next time I will try 4 hours as I think I cooked it too long and it made the ham a little tough.  Will do again.

I made this ham yesterday for Easter and it was sooo good! It is the only way i will make ham from now on! I used a 9lb. spiral cut ham from Costco, added 1 cup of dark brown sugar, the contents of the spice packet from the ham and cooked on low for 6 hours. It was PERFECT.  Try it, you wont be sorry...

This was an awesome receipe!  My husband said it was the best ham I have ever cooked - and we have been married 25 years.  I did have an 11 1/2 lb ham, and a 6 qt crockpot.  I followed a few other reviews and cut the ham so it would fit.  Then I covered the top with foil and leaned the lid on.  The ham was so juicy and flaverful.  Thank you!

OMG!  This is the best ever!  It was so easy and wonderful!  I only had a 2 pound ham so I adjusted the brown sugar.  I will make this again and again for special dinners!  Nothing is easier!

Amazingly easy!  I made this recipe exactly how it was written, and it was perfect.  The ham just falls apart and is super tender.  My family, little kids included, all raved about it.  I will definitely make this again and again.  8 lbs. is a ton of ham though, so invite company or plan to eat it all week long.  And just as a side note, I have a large crock pot and the 8 lb. ham fit in it perfectly.  So if you have a smaller one, you're going to want to cut this recipe in half.  Also, I lined my crock pot with a crock pot liner (found at the grocery store by the tin foil) and I'm super glad I did.  I pulled the ham out, left the bone and grease/juice behind, and tossed the bag in the garbage when we were done.

This ham is melt in your mouth delicious and incredibly tender!  My hubby normally isn't crazy about ham, but he loves this one. How easy...we followed the recipe exactly, except with a 8.5 pound smoked shank ham.  When we took it out about 9 hours later, it fell apart, eliminating the need for carving!  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!  I'll be making it again very soon!

Good taste & very tender. Very, very easy recipe. I followed recipe exactly but during cooking I inserted a knife into ham and basted inside and out with the crock pot juices.

Good, easy, but nothing special.  Used a butt end bone-in ham and covered the top of the crock pot with heavy duty foil since the lid didn't fit securely.  Nice alternative if your oven is in use for something else.  Lots of options for changing the flavor, also.

This turned out really well. I added the juice from a jar of maraschino cherries because I like how it turns the ham a nice rosy color. All the brown sugar melted into the bottom of the slow cooker so I did turn it half way through. It turned out really moist, and I would definitely make this again.

Off the hook! Bought a honey-cured, fully cooked ham that didn't fit.  Brought everything to work, plugged my slow cooker in, set it to 4hrs (since it was cooked), covered the pot with 3 dish towels, put the lid on, and...tah-dah!  Great ham! Easy!

This was an awesome find!!! It came out great even though I didn't use as much brown sugar as it called for.  I did take some of the other suggestions into account and cooked it for only 5 hours.  This is a great recipe for when you have a housefull and only one oven.

This was so good! I used a hickory smoked ham and added as suggestion by another reviewer one can of pineapple rings and mixed the juice with the brown sugar on the bottom. I did baste this ham every hour to 2 hours with the cut side on the bottom. Ham is not something I usually crave, but boy I sure did on this. Such a easy recipe. 
Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe! Oh, I saved the bone with ham on their and cooked with a another recipe that I'm going to post for pinto beans in the Crock. Man, they were good, too!

YUM! Tonight was the second time that I made this. The first time, my husband found it a bit sweet (not me), so this time I coated the ham with mustard and then patted on the brown sugar. Perfect!

The Best!!  I cooked a 4.67 lb. ham for Thanksgiving, following the directions exactly using the bone-in, picnic ham (smoked) and brown sugar.  Four hours on low and the meat thermometer registered 140 so I turned the cooker to high and it was done 45 minutes later.  Using an electric knife, I sliced the juiciest, sweetest ham I've ever tasted.  Fantastic sandwiches that everyone loved.  The best part, the ham was under $6.00.  Thank you.

Im making this for Thanksgiving. I made it the other night but I was nervous not to have liquid on the bottom. So I added pinapple juice. When it was done I had too much liquid. So Thusday I will only use the brown sugar on the bottom. I cant wait. It was really tasty!!

Absolutely delicious and tender!  We did a smaller ham since it is only two of us, and it cooked quickly on low.  We basted it every 30 minutes with it's own juices and it was super moist and easy to carve.

The best part is the clean up was a breeze and it freed up my oven to cook other things.

I think next time I will use a little less brown sugar, and perhaps a bit of liquid smoke.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! I couldn't find a picnic ham, so I just bought a small 2 1/2 lb. boneless ham. Can't wait to try it exactly as the recipe specifies. Husband even commented on how good it was. Smell was great while cooking.

The ham was good.  I left an 8 lb picnic ham in the crock pot on low 8 hours and probably could have left it in longer.

Reviewed this back in 2005.  This is so easy.  All these reviews say ham is done in 4-5 hours which doesn't help us working folks much so I wanted to say that mine was left for 10 hours and it was still delicious.  Yes it turned brown from sugar but so what.  Everyone loved it.  It would present better I guess then with less time.  I used a bone in ham that was probably about 6-7 lb and as with others it didn't fit but put foil on with lid on top and as it cooked it shrunk and then fit snug.  Just made the ham and potato soup from this site with leftovers and making quiche with remainder.  Fast, cheap, and good.  What's not to like?

I was very skeptical about this recipe, but my family loved it!! In order to fit the ham in my crock pot, however, I had to take it off the bone and it would have been better left on the bone, so a BIG pot is needed. Otherwise, I loved it.

Only ok.  I bought a cure 81 ham - on the lean side, but I thought it would still be fine for the slow cooker.  After 4 hrs the ham was not tender, after 6 hours I had to stop cooking as I saw that the ham could not go any longer.  I had used 2 c brown sugar and a little brown mustard. The flavor was good, but I had hoped that the ham would become soft and tender and it did not. Maybe the lean cut of ham was not the correct choice.  I would not bother with this again.

I did 1/4 of everything for the ham and brown sugar so 2 pounds of precooked ham and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Added 1/4 cup of spicy brown mustard, 1/4 cup of cola, 3/8 cup of bourbon. Cooked on low for 1.5 hours. DELICIOUS!

I made this yesterday and we had it for dinner and let me just say there is hardly any left. The family LOVED it. I did a smaller one but it was just as good!!! If you like slow cooker meal you HAVE to try the Reynolds slow cooker liners! No clean up and they are wonderful!!

Holy simple goodness! This was SO incredibly easy and kept the ham perfectly moist. My ham was a little large for my crockpot so I covered with foil. Thank you, I last made this for Christmas and am making it again Sunday for Easter. Great go-to recipe!

LOVED IT!  I did this in the skillet.  I melted brown sugar and butter together, put the ham steak on top and slow cooked for 30-45 minutes.  So yummy:)

Here is a helpful little more flavorful idea. Take and push whole cloves around the ham except the bottom about 1in apart in a grid like pattern. Then rub the ham like the recipe says with the brown sugar and then take about 1 cup of shredded pineapple in a can along with the pineapple juice and sprinkle on ham making a layer of pineapple  over the ham. Then follow the remaining directions for cooking this recipe.

Have made this for two holiday dinners now and both times it was excellent! My 9 lb. hams were just a touch too tall so I trimmed slices off the top.  Both times I bought a black Forrest spiral sliced and it  came with a packet to make a glaze. It had brown sugar, honey and other spices and was in powdered form so I just used that poring most on the bottom before putting the ham in and then using more to rub on the ham like the recipe. Cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours and it was perfect thanks!

This recipe is amazing. My family said it was the best ham ever. I used a spiral cut ham. So the only thing I did different was cooked on low for 4 hrs instead of 8.

What an amazing recipe! Everyone at the Easter dinner table was in heaven and said it had better flavor than the expensive honey baked.  I used a store brand smoked ham, brown sugar on bottom and sides, covered with foil (ham too large to use lid) cooked on low for 4 hours and was perfect! Moist and very pretty to display. Don't forget the liner bag!

We used a 10 lb., bone in, fully cooked, smoked ham. dumped the juice from the pineapple rings in and cooked for just under 4 hours on low. We took the foil off and turned it over once an hour, then put the foil back on. I think it was the best ham I've ever tasted. It was moist, sliceable and pink. PERFECT! My son, who is a picky eater, asked to take home leftovers-which he never, ever does. I wish the scalloped potatoes turned out as good. Oh well, can't win em all.

instead of brown sugar, I just pour a little real maple syrup over the ham and cook in slow cooker. I used pancake syrup the 1st time but I turned up allergic to corn and since pancake syrup is mostly corn syrup, I switched to the real thing. Much better.

Everyone in the family liked this dish, even my very picky eater.  An extremely simple recipe with nice simple flavors.  I used an cheap unsliced smoked ham and cooked it on low for 4.5 hours.  The only reason I cut the time down was so that we could eat dinner on time; but it was plenty of time to completely heat the ham all the way through nicely. Will definately make again!

I don't know what happened but I followed the receipe to a T.  The cooking time is WAY over what is really needed, I'm glad I was watching it as I stopped cooking it when I saw that the top half that was not soaking in the liquid was drying out...the part that was in the liquid was all stringy.  Not sure if it's my taste buds or what but I did not care for this.

Followed recipe. Instead of putting on a plate it was put in the garbage. The ham was tough and burnt. Cooking time needs to be only 3 1/2 hours.

I used a picnic ham and this recipe is not impressive. A picnic ham is similar to a pork loin but larger and with a bone. The.brown sugar added no flavor. Overall, it was nothing special.

I have cooked my ham with just brown sugar and sometimes a little bit of Honey for the last 14 years. I have never tried cooking it in the slow cooker but I will this year. I have always cooked thanksgiving dinner the entire family ( my side and my hubbies side) about 25 to 35 people every year and it will be sooooooo much easier using a slow cooker instead of getting up at 3 am to get the oven going to have time to cook the turkey and the ham. Now I will be able to cook them both at the same time. Thanks so much.

wow - the best ham I have ever made! I bought a six pound ham and it wouldnt fit in my slow cooker, so I cooked it in a covered roasting pan in a 300 degree oven for three hours. Fantastic! I also sprinkled a bit of garlic, smoked paprika and rosemary on it during cooking. I thickened the juices and served it as a gravy. This is my household's new ham recipe!

I used a spiral sliced ham and followed directions exactly.  How can something so simple be so delicious?  The combination of the brown sugar and ham juices was absolutely succulent.  Great holiday main dish.

This was an excellent recipe I used for Easter this year.  I did make some adjustments to add my own twist.  I used a half ham (shank) and cut into large chunks.  Layered brown sugar on bottom, added ham and sprinkled brown sugar over it then added more ham.  To the top, I poured a mixture I cooked stovetop of brown sugar, honey and mustard.  Cooked on low for 2-3 hours in crockpot.  Best ham I've ever made and my husband is on day 3 of leftovers with no complaints!!

Hate to be a drag here, but ... the ham turned out absolutely DELICIOUS, but it was so tender it crumbled into pieces when I took it out of the crockpot.  I think the APPEARANCE of food is also important to the appetite, thus my lower than average rating.  Maybe I need to get a little more down-to-earth!

STOP RIGHT THERE!!! I have been making my Easter Hams like this for years, when I first stumbled across the recipe, I thought, "no way, it can't be that easy"... it truly is. I will never make a ham another way, only change I sometimes make is to add some pure maple syrup... only a little though! This is truly an amazing way to cook a ham that will be moist and flavorful.

Recipe is fantastic and soooo easy!!  I'm a single mom, so I'm always looking for something easy that I can put on and be ready by the time I get home. My kids are very picky eaters, but they both gobbled this ham up!  I did use the sprial ham (8lb), with the stated amt of brown sugar, but added pinapple and the juice to the bottom.  It was falling off the bone... I cooked it on high for 6 hours, and that was plenty of time.
Thanks for the slow cooker recipe!  Dinner saver!

I added some soda to the bottom of the crockpot. Turned the ham half way thru. Ppineapple juice mixed with brown sugar and rubbed on the top about an hour before it was done. Then threw some crushed pineapples on top and let the cooker brown them slightly. Turned out great!

OMG!!! Today was the first time I have EVER cooked a ham. I used an 8-lb hickory smoked, bone-in shank and butt ham (don't know much about different ham cuts) and the two cups of brown sugar. At first, it didn't fit, so I put foil over it and then my lid. After it shrank some, I was able to use only the lid. I cooked it for eight hours, checking it once every 1-2 hours. It turned out wonderful and every picky tween over my house loved it. Its definitely a winner. Next time, I think I will trim some of the fat off the ham first or try one that is leaner.

This was SO good and easy!  I used a smoked bone-in ham butt, and after reading all the reviews I had no idea what to do about time, so I used a thermometer. I was using a 6.5 pound cut and it took approx 4.5 - 5 hours on low to get to 160 degrees.  It made plenty of juice, which I drizzled over the meat when serving.  Will definitely make again, but will use a larger cut since I don't seem to have leftovers.

I made this for Christmas dinner...it was soooo good and so easy!  I had a 6.5 lb. spiral ham which I cooked on low for about 6 hours at which point it was falling off the bone.  I used half the amount of sugar called for and it came out great, we don't like it too sweet. My family said this was the best ham they've ever tasted.

So very disappointed in this recipe. Sure there was a lot of juice, but the ham itself was dry and not tasty. I will stick to the oven method.

I am excited to try this recipe, but not sure on what type of ham to use.  The picnic style at the store only came in a huge shoulder (raw)..8 hours on low on a FJ ham seemed long.

This was such a hit at Thanksgiving, I'm going to make it for Christmas dinner too!  Obviously going to make a bigger one since there were fights over the last pieces.  I made the ham in 2 parts....after the first half was done I cut it and put it with the 2nd half to absorb the flavor.  i did add some pineapple rings and a little juice.  this ham makes it's own juice to bathe in!  excellent!  and it leaves the oven free to make christmas cupcakes =)

Wow. How easy and perfect this was.  I got a non-smoked ham. I rubbed with brown sugar like the recipe indicates and then followed the advice of another reviewer and covered with pinapple rings held on by cloves. I basted it about 3 times during cooking for a little more than 5 hours. (Can't remember the weight if the ham but it just barely fit in my oval crock).  Loved that I could make a turkey and ham on Thanksgiving because the ham did not take up oven space. The leftovers will make amazing breakfast, lunches, and soup additions. I might do this more often than holidays.

This recipe is amazing. Flat out, best ham ever. I got so many compliments on it, it took all the focus off the turkey at Thanksgiving! I did have to hack at it to get it to fit, but it was worth it. It literally fell apart when I went to cut it. So juicy and not salty at all. A perfect blend of sweet and savory. I used a smoked picnic ham. This will become my dish I have to bring to family gatherings now! People are already asking me to bring it for Christmas! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

This was the best ham that I have ever had! My husband and kids also loved this one - I have been informed that from now on, this is the only way that they want me to make a ham dinner. The drippings also made phenomenal gravy.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe -- it seemed too simple.  But then how could 400+ reviewers be wrong :)  I used this recipe for Easter dinner with my parents and it was awesome.  We had it with scalloped potatoes and vegetable.  The only comment I would make is 8 hours was probably a little too long.  If I do it again I'll plan on 6.5 to 7 hours.

I made this ham for Easter and it was fall off the bone amazing. I Rubbed the ham with brown sugar and put brown sugar in the bottom of the slow cooker as indicated. Usually ham has way too much fat on it for me, but cooking it this way causes the fat to fall off. Will make again on Holidays.

I have made this a few times and it turns out really good if you buy a good quality ham.  If you cook a cheaper shank or butt portion, I would only cook it for about 4 hours, or it will turn out like "ham jerkey".  The better quality ham turns out very good cooked like this and is so easy to do.  Sometimes I put pineapple slices on top with tooth picks and brown sugar in the holes.  Good recipe, especially for convenience.  Thank you!

Very easy and results turned out great!  I used a 9lb spiral cut.  I just eyeballed the brown sugar (plus I sprinkled ground cloves) in the bottom of the crock, so probably about a cup of brown sugar, total.  I placed the ham cut side down then rubbed about the same amount of brown sugar and sprinkled ground cloves on outside of the ham.  I cooked it on low for about 6 1/2 hours.  Was not over cooked at all, very juicy and flavorful.  I will never cook a ham in the oven again.  Next time, I'll use the seasoning packet included in the ham.  Highly recommended!

I bought an 8lb  uncooked bone in ham for $8. I have a smaller slow cooker so I had to trim it down a bit. I just took the extra and cooked in the oven and will use for scalloped potatos tonight. I cooked the bone in ham according to the recipe. After 8 hours on low it was great. Then we added a can of pineapple rings w/liquid and let it continue on low for an additional 2 hours. So good! This recipe made an $8 ham taste like a $50 ham!!

I made this for Easter dinner, and will probably never cook a ham in the oven again! The ham didn't quite fit in the crock pot, so I put aluminum foil over the cover to help seal it. Besides the brown sugar, I had about a cup of leftover pineapple juice and I added that. I am not sure if it was really needed, since the ham and its juices along with the brown sugar was so moist. Everyone loved it. I was glad not to have my oven on all day, especially since it was so warm outside. Thank you!

This turned out great for me. I used a 6.75 lb ham and had to carve it a bit in order to cram it in my crockpot. In addition to the brown sugar I threw a small can of crushed pineapple in with it, as well. I cooked it on low for 7.5 hours and I think it was too long. It was very tasty, but just a bit dry. Such an easy way to make ham and will do so more often thanks to this easy method. A keeper!

really good--i used the spice packet from the spiral cut ham which is pretty much sugar and spice--just sprinkled it over the ham and let it cook about 4 hours on low--used the foil to cover it in the crock pot and it came out perfect  super easy and frees up the oven

I used this recipe and placed thickly sliced onions on the bottom of the slow cooker then put brown sugar on top of the onions, the rest as stated.  Perfect Easter, or any day, ham.

Well, we can't get a proper ham over here (Scotland), only a "gammon roast," which is often times rolled, and sometimes pumped with additives.  We buy the best thing we can find, and this is how we cook it.  This recipe is flexible, too.  We have done it in the slow cooker, and we have cooked it for a couple hours in a covered casserole in the oven.  SO GOOD!  It always comes out great.  We add the tiniest bit of liquid, usually orange juice or pineapple juice, to the pot.  The flavour and tenderness are the best.  Thanks for this recipe!

Really delicious and easy way to make a whole ham.  I used a 6 pound boneless ham and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  It was juicy and tender and not at all salty.  I will definitely make hams this way again.

I decided to try this as a easier way to prepare my Christmas ham.  I bought a 11 lb. half ham.  I had to cover the top with foil as the lid wouldn't fit.  I cooked it for 5 1/2 hours.  It was dry, falling apart and difficult to slice.  I will go back to my old roasting method.

I wasn't to sure about this at first. But I thought I'd give it a try. Came out Awesome! When I told everyone that I cooked it in the crock pot they didn't believe me. Definately worth the wait.

I mde this again for the second time and an hour before the ham was done I drained most of the juice from the pot and thickened it with corn starch to have sauce to serve with the ham.  I also added some baked beans to the pot.  My family said it was the best ham & beans they have ever had.  This is sooo good and it couldn't be any easier to make.  Try it, especially you busy working moms.  I think you'll be glad you did.

This was awesome !!!! At first I was alittle hesitant so I put 1 can of pineapple on the ham and then rubbed it with the brown sugar. It was fall off the bone soooooooooo good and lucky I only put one can in because there was aton of juice from the ham and I am pretty sure it would have over spilled if I had put another in.  My kids and husband gave it 2 thumbs up so I know it was really good. Will always make it this way from now on great recipe thank you so much !!!!!!!!!

I made this ham last year, as my first ham, and my family loved it.  I have made it several times since.  I also added a little pineapple juice to the bottom of the cooker and it was so delicious. Great recipe and so easy

This is just an excellent, super-easy recipe.  I've used it twice and since it is "dump and leave" in nature is much more convenient than other ham recipes.  I made it for company the other night to rave reviews!  You won't be disappointed.  Obviously adjust your cooking time for type or size of ham.

This was so simple and turned out so fantastic.  The ham melted off the bone!!  We used a 10lb ham and in my opinion the end result was much better than a honey baked ham.  This is definately a keeper!

I have tried many recipes and this really is the best ham recipe I've found! Both my mother and myself do not like ham, but I served this last Easter because my husband loves ham, and we were both delighted. So easy, plus it left the oven open for turkey and other sides.

I'm not a big fan of ham, but my guys love it.  I thought this recipe was delicious.  Next time I won't cook it quite so long.  6 hours probably would have been long enough. Thanks for the simple recipe.

Wow only brown sugar and ham who would have thought.  It was very good and added so much flavor.  It does take a lot of brown sugar but seeing as it is the only other ingredient besides the ham itself it makes sense.  I have tried so many other ham recipes with liquor, without, mustard, you name it.  This one is a keeper.

This is the best ham I've ever made and it sure doesn't get any simpler than this!  I made two hams for Easter - one with pineapple/orange juice and 7-up in the crock pot and this was the other one.  They were the same ham, just cut in half and this recipe was way more moist than the other -- and the flavor was WONDERFUL, especially those super-sweet pieces from the bottom of the crock pot.  Great recipe!!

I don't know what I did wrong, but this did not turn out like other reviews.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY including the 8 hours of cooking on low.  I got a huge new crock pot last year and the 8 lb. butt ham fit perfectly. The meat tasted okay=pretty sweet and more like beef than pork.  But the edges were over cooked and inedible.  The overall texture was a little dry and fell into small pieces.  I was so disappointed after reading the reviews. If I ever put a ham in the slow cooker, I would only let it go a few hours-we put this on before we went to bed, so I couldn't check on it until 5 am.  Oh well, live and learn.

Blessedly simple!  My ham was a bit too big,but I just covered the whole top in aluminum foil & set the lid on top of that.    I added a little ground cloves to the brown sugar, it came out excellent.

Very yummy. I was worried about not having any liquid in with the brown sugar but it came out perfect. And it didn't burn or stick to my crock pot either. The ham made plenty of juice by itself. I could not fit my lid on the crock pot so I used tin foil. I doubled it up and sealed it the best that I could. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very easy and very good, but I personally think that a can of crushed pineapple would have made it better!  I still gave 5 stars because everyone raved about it.  I recommend turning the ham so that all sides can soak and cook in the juices.

Excellent flavor, and very easy, but even 4 hours on the 8 hour/LOW setting is too long with a spiral sliced ham. Meat tended to be too dry. (Saved it with a cranberry raisin sauce.) Next time I will try the 10 hour/LOW setting and check at 3 hours. Like many others I needed to cover with foil, which worked just fine. This is a "keeper" with necessary adjustments for preferred ham type and my slow cooker settings.

This didn't turn out well.  I don't blame the recipe that's why I gave it four stars.  The ham I used wasn't bone in, it didn't fall apart at all.  It did get brown and was tough on the face  all in all my ham was edible but slightly tough.  My ham was a fully cooked Morrell honey ham.  Hopefully this review will keep others from making the same bonehead mistake I did!

I made this for my husband for Father's day.  It is one of the best hams I have ever made, and I didn't even have to warm up my oven!  It did finish way earlier than planned though.  (It only took 5 hours on Low)  I also added a can of pineapple chunks (the chunks look pretty spooned on to the slices) and also studded the ham with cloves.  I made a sauce with the drippings by adding cornstarch, dijon mustard and a dash of hot sauce.  Delicious!

Yummy! Easy way to prepare ham.  Used 2.5 lb boneless ham and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  Put 1/2 cup brown sugar on bottom of crockpot, put in ham and then rubbed with additional 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Put on warm for about 45 minutes and then to low for 3.5 hours.  Came home from church and dinner was ready.

Soooo good!  My husband was moaning as he took sneak bites of it while carving and told our guests, "I don't really want you to eat any of this, because I want it all to myself."  This is my go-to ham recipe from now on.  I can think of no better way to cook a main dish on a holiday than in a crockpot, so you can get out of the kitchen and socialize and celebrate.  Perfect!

This was a huge hit!  It was the easiest ham I've ever prepared, and the tastiest too.  Juicy and tender... yum!  It's the only way I'll cook ham, from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We were not really sure about a recipe with only 2 ingredients, but sure are glad that we tried it! Awesome, unbelievable ham. Moist, flavorful, not too salty, just incredible!

I used a 7 lb. picnic ham (butt portion).  I followed the recipe exactly except I poured 1 can of crushed pineapple over the ham the last 4 hours of cooking.  It was wonderful.  I've cooked many hams, and this will be the only recipe I use from now on.  I agree with others that it is important to use a picnic ham.  A smoked ham and/or a spiral sliced ham might not give the same results.  I chopped the left-over ham and used it in a recipe for crockpot scalloped potatoes.  It was very good also.

I have never cooked a ham cause I thought it would be hard.  But this was so easy.  I couldn't find a picnic ham, so I just used a hickory ham with a bone.  It was so juicy and the liquid it makes goes great over sweet potatoes.  I will make this again and hopefully I will have leftovers to make sandwiches this time.   I also used a slow cooker liner and it was a super easy clean up.   Thanks  This a keeper

I have to chuckle as I type this out, because, thanks to this recipe, this is the first time in over 30 years of cooking that I actually made a ham that was enjoyed by all. I made no changes to this recipe, and actually made this twice in one week. The second time I did use a spiral cut ham, just didn't lay it open side down in the brown sugar, I basted it periodically instead...perfection. Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!

Loved this!  I used about a 5 1/2 lb ham in a 3 qt crock pot.  It was not quite done after 5 hours on high (I think the center must have been still frozen) so left it for a couple more on low.  I had so much liquid the crock pot almot bubbled over.  Delicious!

I really loved this recipe because it was super easy and the flavor was fantastic.  There was one problem though. My ham was very dry.  Next time I will watch the ham better and make sure it doesn't dry out. There was plenty of liquid in the crock.  My experiance was a 4 star but had I watched the ham better I think it would have been a definite 5 star.

For me - it was just all right.  It was done way before the scheduled time and I turned it off for a couple of hours before I had to serve it and then reheated it - but if I had not been home it would have been a disaster.  Simple recipe though - for average results.

I used a 10.5 lb bone in pre-cooked ham.  I rubbed the ham with approximately 3/4 cup brown sugar and placed approximately 1 1/4 cup in the bottom.  I placed the ham face down as directed.  The lid wouldn't fit so I covered the slow cooker with aluminum foil  I cooked it on low for  6 hours and it came out so juicy and great!  So easy!!  I will never cook a ham any other way.  Thank you!  Everyone loved it!

I have made this ham a couple times now and I love it! It's so easy, no fuss. I love how I can free up my oven by making it in the crock.  It tastes amazing.  Just a little bit of sweetness along with salty of the meat, very tender, too. Use the bone in a pot of beans. Excellent recipe in every respect. Thank you for posting it!

This is the 4th time I have made a ham this way so I can say, with confidence, that the results are superbly tender and tasty....perhaps the best ham I have ever had. one small caution: Don't cook TOO long. 8 hours on low is quite long enough for a 9 or 10 lb smoked, uncut butt portion, or maybe even 6 or 7 hours. Longer hours result in a darker, drier meat that shreds too easily and is still tasty but less succulent. My best results for the same sized ham were achieved with 2 hours on High + 2 hours on Low OR 6 hours on low. This makes such a great and easy  meal. Sliced leftovers  freeze well, too!

I used a bone in, smoked ham, butt-portion, just under 8 pounds.  I rubbed a little less than the full 2 cups of brown sugar all over the ham.  Cooked on Low for about 5-6 hours and then switched to warm.  It was the best, juiciest ham.  So much better than cooking in an oven.  Tomorrow is soup day with lots of ham left over for sandwiches!

Best shank ham I have ever made.  I was taught that you needed to boil a shank ham.  Since I was having the family over after work I did not have the time to boil a ham so I decided to use my slow cooker.  I must admit I added half a cup of water since I was not going to be around to watch it. It made juice so I am sure the water was not required.  I will not be boiling another shank ham anytime soon.  My family raved above this and the best part, it was so quick and easy.

This recipe and reviews looked great.  I packed my largest crockpot around to five different stores and could not find a ham that would work, even with trimming.  Spoke to butcher in all five stores and received no help.

Our 11 year old granddaughter used this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it so she was all excited to make this years ham for Christmas we just put it in the crock-pot. She loves all the compliments she gets and we had to get a bigger ham for Christmas hoping we have leftovers!!! Thank you for posting this extremely simply and wonderfully delicious recipe!

I used a 9.5 lb. spiral sliced ham and cooked it on low for four hours with the same amounts of brown sugar. I did add a few tablespoons of water to the bottom of the pot, just in case. I loved it! Great flavor and very tender - lots of liquid for basting at the end. Best of all, I loved being able to throw away the glaze packet that comes with the ham. Whenever I use those, I feel like the ham is too salty. I liked the subtle sweetness of this much better.

This is the best way to cook a ham. It came out moist and easy to slice. I was concerned because some of the reviewers said that it fell apart, but it didn't for me. I cooked a 6 pound ham about three hours on low. I usually never eat ham, but this was really very good.

I used a 9 lb spiral cut ham. I followed the recipe except I added 2 cups of pineapple juice as well. I covered my ham tightly with foil before putting the lid on and cooked on low for 3 hours. It was very good. I will be cooking my ham like this from now on (frees up the oven for other dishes!)

I couldn't believe how wonderfully this turned out! I only had a 6-lb bone-in spiral-sliced ham (so it fit sitting in there nicely), so I used 1.5 c brown sugar, and I did add about a half-cup of water at the bottom. I took the advice of another reviewer and drizzled some honey on top. I put it on "low" for 90 minutes, basted it a bit, then went another half hour and it was good to go!

Hard to find the right ham, and then to fit it in my crock pot.  However, my family loved this.  They raved over how juicy the meat was, and flavorful.  They begged me to make it again!

I made this today for friends after church and it was a big hit.  I heated a 7 lb butt portion (pre-cooked) in a 6 quart crock pot for approx 4 hours on low setting.  I did change the seasonings to 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup apricot jelly and 2 tbsp Dijon mustard.  Moist and delicious!

Very good.  Used a fresh picnic.  Don't think it was cured.  Turned out great and later used the bone and some of the meat for bean soup.

Used an 8lb. spiral ham from Costco and added 1/2 c. orange juice poured over top before placing lid.  Was able to turn the ham sideways and it worked great.  Cooked for 5 hours in a "new generation" crock pot on low (they are much hotter than old ones).  I flipped ham a few times as it shrunk to distribute sugar.  Makes the most delicious juice.  Remove ham, slice, freeze bone for soup, put slices back in juice in crock on warm.  Refrigerate leftovers with juice (which jellies in fridge and re-warms nicely in deep skillet on low heat).  Ham came out VERY MOIST AND STAYED MOIST kept in the delicious juice.  Best ham sammies we've ever had.

This was fabulous. I put it in the crock pot at 12:00 AM Xmas eve and it was done on Xmas morning.  We had ham sandwiches for Xmas brunch and the day after Xmas I made split pea soup with the ham bone.  Easy , tender and very moist and flavorful ham.  Will definitely be making this again!

I used an 8 pound fully smoked spiral cut ham.  I substituted the spice packet that came with the ham for the brown sugar, and cut the cooking time down to 2-3 hours.  This recipe worked out great, the ham was flavorful, moist and even better no leftovers!!!

So easy to prepare and the results were phenomenal! The ham was juicy and delicious. It fell right off the bone! I was afraid it might turn out too sweet but it was perfect. I will definitely make this again SOON

made this as a last minute Xmas Eve meal that I was not planning to do, but grabbed a ham (9 lb, smoked, bone in) and had some brown sugar already at home...threw that sucker in my crockpot, set it to high for 4 hours and came out amazing! Highly recommend for a simple juicy ham recipe.

Eight hours is too long to cook. The meat fell off the bone and was basically shreds. I would suggest no longer than four hours to cook. That aside, the taste is delicious!!!

Pleasantly surprised. My 7.5lb. bone in spiral sliced ham was perfect on low in about 5 hrs. I did turn it over one time since it just barely fit in crock pot, very moist without being overly sweet. Did not use any glaze.

To the people that have trouble with the ham being too big to get the crockpot lid on, my husband cam with a great idea: Don't use the lid, instead put a domed mixing bowl that the upper rim is about as big as the top of your crockpot, turn the mixing bowl upside down on top of the crock pot and WA LAH! you have a domed lid for the crock pot that covers it and keeps the heat in.  This turned out fantastic at Thanksgiving!  Thought all the brown sugar might make the gravy taste funny, but it didn't!  Wonderful color and flavor.  I am making this again tomorrow for Easter.

It's a miracle!  No alterations needed. I used a regular bone-in ham from Safeway, super easy, no fussy end-time, ham released lots of juice. Frees up your oven and your time for other things like skiing!

The ham was cooked and tender in 8 hours; however, it had darkened considerably and wasn't visually appealing.  It also had sat in all of the grease in such all day.  I will find another way to make it.

It was great for Christmas dinner,  We used a spiral cut ham and had to cut it off the bone to fit it into my 7 qt crock pot.  We added crushed pineapple and cloves and slow cooked it on low for 3 1/2 hours.  The ham was delicious!!

Used a spiral sliced ham, which I realize now was a mistake (and wasn't what was indicated in the recipe, either). It fell apart-- couldn't lift it out of the crock pot, and definitely not appropriate for company (I was hoping this could be second meat for Thanksgiving that didn't need the oven). Despite falling apart, much of the meat was not very tender, disappointing. Also, I had gotten a honey ham-- another mistake. With the brown sugar in this recipe, it was overpoweringly sweet. After eating the meat, we used the bone to make a pot of pinto beans-- still so sweet they tasted like baked beans! I may try this recipe again because it is so darn easy, but will definitely use a different ham. Lesson learned!

I used a very small ham wrapped in  netting.  This helped prevent it from falling apart.  I agree that the brown sugar could have probably been cut in half.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and ground cloves.  This was wonderful and my entire family liked it.

This was great...really don't need any extra liquid. I put foil on top and then the lid because my ham was a little too tall. We put it on high went to church, 4 hrs later came home to a ham falling off the bone. I also added crushed pineapple just because we like the taste of it.

I prefer to do my ham up in the oven normally... but this Christmas I was pressed for time and had to make the meal Christmas eve.  You can't ask for a simpler recipe and the resulting taste will please all but the fussier palates.

I am not a ham person (and neither was my dear friend that was at my Thanksgiving dinner) but may partner is a ham fan so I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and it was WOWZA! I don't know what kind of ham I even used but I did exactly as written and it was amazing! I am now a ham girl :) and my friend that doesn't like ham either....went to the store the next day and made this exact recipe! Amazing flavor! Thank you! This is now my forever ham recipe :)

Fast and easy.  This recipe is as basic as it gets.  (I added pineapple juice as my slow cooker tends to burn things when there is not enough liquid.)  My roast was moist, but I was missing flavor in the meat beyond the outer layer even after rotating this during the cook time.  Next time I will try piercing the roast before cooking to allow more flavor in.

KITCHEN CATASTROPHE! (But it was totally my bads)... I'm sure this recipe is rock-your-socks but I, unknowledgeable on pork as it is, asked my boyfriend  to pick the "picnic ham"... he chose pork shoulder - shoulder... ham is the leg... do you see the problem here?  Pork shoulder is fatty and really ... ham-y (no better way to say it).  It also doesn't release all the nice liquid a ham does... this calculation equals a SERIOUSLY BURNT crock pot.  It had to be soaked 24 hours and scrubbed until my skin was raw to work off the gnarly black crust it created.  The meat was cooked and edible but not in a good way.  I don't blame the recipe.  Just be sure you DOUBLE CHECK what meat you are getting and try hard not to be as stupid as I am!

I made this with a regular ham-butt cut. It was really good and so easy to make. I did put in a can of pineapple with the juice but next time I am not going to bother. I think I will make it this way for the holidays if I can fit it in the pot! had to use the foil idea that others had mentioned since the lid didn't fit.

Very good! I actually like my ham less sweet, but my family loved this. I have a big slow cooker and a 10.8lb bone-in ham fit perfectly. I did not use any extra sugar, and covered the ham with foil before putting on the lid. Thanks for the easy recipe!

I cooked this for mother's day and it was a great success.  This will be the way I cook hams for now.  I did use a smoked ham and it did turn dark and looked dryed out, but it was very moist and fell off of the bone

I made this recipe for Easter (my first time hosting) and today... hams were on sale.  My first time ever to cook a ham let alone in a crock pot.  I got rave reviews from the family as well as neighbors and co-workers who I had try some because I was so proud!  I followed the recipe to a tee... except for cooking it a little longer, it did not dry it out.  I can not wait to have it for dinner tonight!

I made this ham the night before Easter day, and it was wonderful! So easy and so tender. I also was worried it would be really salty right out of the package but this wasn't at all. 
I added cinnamon and ground cloves. Very good I will be making it again.

I don't believe it myself, but this incredibly simple recipie brings back the taste of hams my mother cooked in the oven in the 50-s and 60's.  Tender, tasty and so easy.  Who knew?  My ham was just an inexpensive bone in ham to start with and it turned out just great. Thanks so much for sharing this simple recipe.  You know, I had given up on cooking ham and resorted to the expensive honey baked hams.  Never again.  This is my new go-to.

When my mother walked in and saw that I was cooking the Christmas ham in the crock pot - she freaked out and starting to look at take out menus.  When she took a taste, she now thinks I"m a genius!  Make sure you use the crock pot liner for sure.  It gets sticky.  The only thing I did was use some of the extra sauce to sweeten my carrots.  It was a huge hit!

I didn't like this recipe. It was hard to find a ham small enough for my slow cooker. It was hard to remove the ham from the cooker. I think its just as easy to use the oven. I wouldn't do this again.

This was excellent.  I added cinnamon and all spice to the brown sugar which gave the ham a smoky sweet flavor.  Fabulous.  I only cooked it for 5 hours and it was perfect.

I used a 5 lb smoked picnic ham for this recipe.  No idea if it was the brown sugar or the ham itself, but it turned out great!  I probably should have blotted the ham a little more because the brown sugar didn't stick very well, but like I said, the end result was tasty.

I made this just as the recipe stated except I did add 1 can of pineapple rings with the juice.  I would have given it 5 stars because the taste was wonderful, except the ham lost it's "ham" look.  It ended up looking a odd brown color, which didn't look great for presentation.  Other than that it was easy and tasted great.  I will make it again.

This was amazing! All I had in the fridge was a turkey ham but we actually liked that better than a pork ham. Something in the flavor of the turkey is just wonderful when it mixes with the brown sugar.  I also didn't cook it for 8 hours as my ham was really small and pre-cooked.  About 2 hours was long enough.

I followed the recipe and 8 hours was definatly too long.  If not for the reviews I wouldn't have thought to keep the juices and make a nice thick sauce b/c it's an amazing idea.  ham was good but together it'd be 5 stars.

I made this today using a 7.5 lb semi boneless ham.  It was already fully cooked (and it was smoked) and then frozen. I thawed the ham before putting it in the crockpot.  I followed the recipe - put 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar in the bottom of the pot, then set the ham in on top of it, cut side down.  I only had enough regular brown sugar for the bottom of the pot, so I used another 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar to rub on the ham.  Finally, I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon, a bit of nutmeg and a bit of ginger over the top of the sugar layer on the ham (probably about a 1/2 tsp of each).  I put the pot on low and let it go for 8 hours.  I was surprised at the amount of liquid - the pot was about half full of it.  The ham was not sliced and I pulled it out in several chunks, as it was very moist and tender and basically fell off the bone.  The taste was outstanding.  I made some mashed potatoes and some scalloped apples to serve along with the ham for tonight's dinner.  I used a slow cooker liner so clean up was pretty simple as well.  We have a ton of ham left over, but we also have a lot of sides...hoping to eat at least another dinner out of this - hopefully maybe 2.  I am very picky about crockpot recipes and there are very few I LOVE and then make again.  I will be making this one again, however.  I was not disappointed.  Even my picky 4 year old ate the ham right up, and he doesn't like anything.  Definitely a winner in my house.

Wow!!! I take this into work and no one believes that it's just Ham a slow cooker and brown sugar.  So easy.  Really nice at Christmas or Thanksgiving if your cooking a Turkey frees up the oven.  Yet still very tasty.  :)

I thought this was delicious!!  I used most of the sugar and a splash of pineapple juice, (which wasn't needed I don't think)  Plenty of juice came off my 9 pound ham.  I reduced it on the stove and will make a sauce to drizzle over the sliced ham at the next meal.  The ham cooked to my satisfaction in my (newer-not-so-slow) slowcooker in about 4 hours.  Wasn't falling off the bone yet, but needed a meaty bone for my New Years Day Bean Soup.  Next time..and there will be one...I'll let cook longer.  Thanks for a super easy, delicious recipe!!

We have a slow cooker oven (portable) and the wife uses it to do hams. She wraps the ham in foil with liquid smoke, and cooks it on low for 6 to 8 hours, depending on the size of the ham. Always comes out nice and moist.

This is phenomenal.  Everyone loved it, and we're not even ham lovers!  I used a cured applewood ham from Costco & added pineapple rings.  It didn't fit my big slow cooker, so I used foil to cover and secured it with a huge rubber band I had in my office.

My family absolutely loved this ham.  It was so tender and juicy.  I will definitely be making this again!  I did follow the suggestion of putting foil over the ham, and it came out perfect.  This was the best ham that I have ever eaten.

Perfect Christmas ham!  I have made this easy & delicious slow cooker ham a couple times in the past & absolutely loved it.  HOWEVER, this time I prepared it with a different, succulent & tasty twist:  I prepared the ham & brown sugar as stated, then simply sprinkled in some pumpkin pie spice, added a sliced onion, a couple dollops of frozen, concentrated orange juice, & tossed in a cup of fresh cranberries.  The result?!?  AMAZING!!  My family loves this ham I served tonight for Christmas dinner... it is delicious, festive, distinctive, & oh so simple to prepare.    5 Stars...most definitely.  I am so thankful to have found this recipe.

Easy + no oven require + delicious =  Winning recipe!  Served for Thanksgiving, family loved it.  It was truly easy to do.  With the oven being busy with the turkey this was truly a multi-task recipe that worked to feed a large family gathering. I added a small cup of pineapple just before serving.

We tried this last Christmas and it was AWESOME!  My mom has already said that's what we're doing this year.  I believe we added some canned pineapple to it as well.

Couldn't have been easier!  I used a 9 lb Cook's Hickory Smoked Pre-Cooked ham, and just the brown sugar as the recipe called for.  After 6.5 hours on low, it was falling off the bone and delicious.  I didn't baste it thoughout cooking as some did b/c I was at work, but I don't think it needed it.  Next time I'll try adding crushed pineapple to see how that tastes since that's how I usually do ham.  GREAT recipe, definitely a keeper!

WOW!!  This got such rave reviews yet my ham was SO DRY!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, my ham was just over 8 lbs., cooked on low for the prescribed time and there was lots of liquid in the crockpot.  But once it was on the platter, it was drier than the Sahara (good flavor but DRRYYY!).  So disappointed.

Cooked a little over a 4 1/2 pound smoked picnic ham for approximately 5 hours removed the ham from the bone and put back in the glaze on low for about 45 minutes.  Used about 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and did not add any additional liquid to the pot.  Ham turned out great.

Only 3 stars at this point due to my over cooking it...it stayed in the slow cooker about 10 hours on Low (because of busy weeknight activities) but I believe if I'd have taken it out sooner, it would have been great! I was suprised that it made so much juice, and wouldn't have been nearly as dry, however I think the brown sugar added to the burnt flavor, even though there was alot of juice in the pan.  I will definately try it again.

This is one of the best hams I have EVER eaten! I made this exactly as written, except for adding some sliced pineapple to the top. It came out so tender, moist and juicy...this will be my ham cooking method from now on! Thanks for sharing. :)

So easy but delicious! I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar as my ham was only 2 lbs, poured pineapple juice in from rings and whisked in 1 tbsp grainy mustard, basted about every hour.

Flippn' amazing... I had to make Easter brunch for the first time ever and this was beyond easy and my father-in-law said it was the most moist ham he's ever had. I will be making this much more often. It was very easy and very delicious! Thank you!

I served this yesterday. My husband loved it. I think the photo is misleading since you won't get that kind of a slice with a bone in. I used a 7.70 lb bone in  butt piece. I trimmed it to fit and not all the pieces fit back in so it was more like a 7 lb ham. I used a thermometer to test the internal temp and after 6 hours it was heated through. I went by the temperature listed in the instructions that came with the ham. I will make this again. Mine did not fall off the bone but it was moist and tender. I did have a hard time to find a small enough ham and found the one I bought in the lunchmeat section of the grocery store. I also measured my crockpot and took a tape measure with me to the store to get one that would work for me. I served this to 8 people, we have leftovers but I do not think it would provide the 24 servings as it states. So easy and so delicious!

I followed the suggestion of covering a large ham with foil - I used this recipe for a 22 pound bone in ham in my crock pot.  It looked funny sticking out of my crock pot, but, covered it with foil to keep the heat from escaping, adjusted the brown sugar amount and rotated the ham a few times - cooked it on low for about 10 hours and then kept it on warm for about 4 hours until serving.  I got rave reviews.  Even my husband who is not a ham fan said it was delicious.

First ham in slow cooker. Could not believe how tender and moist it was. I was skeptical at first, but I am so glad I tried it. I also added some Irish sausage with the ham and it was great.

Got a pre-cooked, spiral sliced 1/4 ham from TJ's. Used 1/2 a cup brown sugar on the bottom, added ham juices, rubbed another 1/2 cup sugar on top. Cooked on low for about 3 hours - turned to warm for another hour while waiting for sides to cook.  Could have served after 2-3 hours.  Had to baste with juice a few times, and turn over to stop from drying out.  DELICIOUS.  I have no desire to ever use another ham recipe.

I've fixed this recipe three times.  You will get the best results with a ham that has NOT been presliced. The spiral precut hams DO NOT work well with this recipe.l  The following review is with a whole ham.  I only had one cup of brown sugar and I put it all in the bottom of the pot then poured a can of undrained pineapple bits over the top of a seven pound ham.  I cooked on low for seven hours.  I was surprised how much water cooked out of the ham.  It stewed in the pineapple, brown sugar broth and was so moist and tender that the meat fell right off the bone when I tried to take it out of the pot.  I took a taste as I took it out of the pot and WOW! it was soooooo good and tender and unlike any ham I had ever eaten.  I made a delecious sandwitch while it was still steaming hot and it suited my tastebuds just right.... EXCELLENT five star ham!!!

This was okay, but really not great. It certainly is an easy way to cook ham on a busy schedule.  The ham was not particularly attractive.  Parts were really stringy. I wound up using it in a number of different casseroles and salads where presentation is not important.  I cubed the larger, juicier pieces and used the stringier parts as "shredded" meat for sandwiches.

Okay, I just had to rate this... I was at Kroger and they had picnic hams on sale (8lb ham for $6 woohoo) so i picked one up to make for my boyfriend.. I HATE ham but we make sacrifices for loved ones lol Anyhoo, I found this recipe and it sounded easy enough.. oh my heck, it was amazing... i work 12 hr shifts and was afraid it would overcook, so i put it on when i went to bed and it was ready when i awoke. It smelled so good that I decided to taste it. As I sit here writing this, I am eating ham and eggs. Thank you LittleMsTxThang, you have made me a ham enjoyer.. wouldn't say lover just yet Btw, I added pineapple juice like some others suggested and then reduced the juices to a syrup to serve over ham fried rice

This is my go-to ham recipe. I have a smaller crockpot, so I use a 2-3 lb half ham, and less sugar. But it's so easy - we have ham every weekend now!

BEST HAM EVER!!! My honey loves a good ham and said this is the "best ham he's ever had". The only thing I did differant was I added some cloves on top after rubbing the brown sugar on (also I had a 7 lb ham, fit perfect in my crock pot). Oh one more thing I cooked mine for four hours on high, EXCELLANT!!!! Thanks for such a simple but great recipe, it's the only way I'll cook this from now on. P.S. I also can't wait to make pea soup with the left over bone. :-)

I had a 7lb small shank ham. I put it in my slow c ooker hoping it would fit. Lucky for me it just did. Every one raved about it. I did not add anything except the brown sugar, and then as the ham was being cut I put a spoon full of sauce in it. YUM.I'm going to buy a bigger cooker just so I always have room to fix this receipe. thank you for the recipe and saving me a lot of clean up time too. MJ

As others stated, I was unsure of this recipe.  I had a 7 1/2 lb bone in , fully cooked ham, and it was done in 4 1/2 hours, when cooked on low.  As suggested by another reviewer, I thickened the liquid with corn starch.  This was really good as a sauce over the ham.  I served this to two picky eaters and they loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

Yum!  Couldn't have been SIMPLER when I had so many other things cooking at the same time.  I only let mine cook for around 4 hours but it was so soft and so sweet when we ate it--everyone loved it.  Being a picnic ham there was virtually no fat or gristle to pick out.  It may not have been as fancy as a spiral cut bone-in ham, but this is BY FAR my favorite way to have a ham dinner.

I tried this ham recipe, thinking it would give me some extra space in my oven. I must of cooked it to long, because it fell apart and was dry. Maybe I can try it again and have better luck.

This recipie was new to me and I didn't allow for a bone-in-ham to fit in to a crock, next time I would get a boneless.  I cooked two 8 oz hams (2 pots) not a bite left..guess it was a hit!!!

Really easy and everyone loved it! I cooked it on high for 3 hours and then switched it to low for about an hour because I was short on time, and it worked great!

GOOD + EASY = 5-STAR. I had a ham for Christmas and found this recipe on allrecipes by accident when searching for glaze for the ham. When I read the recipe, I thought it seemed way to easy as all it called for was a ham, brown sugar, slow cooker, and patience. Upon reading some reviews I had some reservations as I had purchased a precooked spiral sliced ham. I took a chance with my 8 lb ham and hoped for the best. The sugar really didn't stay on the side of the ham when I applied it. A couple of hours into cooking the sugar melted into the liquid. Cook time for my ham was around 5 hours when it reached optimal temperature. The first taste was AWESOME. Glad I took a chance on this.

2 stars because, while it wasn't *awful*, it really didn't go over well. Used a semi-boneless ham and cooked for 1 hour/pound, but it came out really dry and not at all tasty. I was hopeful that I had discovered a great new way to cook a ham, but given the results, I won't be doing this again.

Almost any well-cured ham will turn out wonderfully in a crockpot without adding a thing. I feel there is way too much sugar in this recipe. I usually make split pea soup with the bone, but not from this ham.

If I could give this 6 stars I would.  I was so skeptical that this would turn out well.  What a delicious moist and easy way to cook ham. I really can't imagine cooking ham any other way in the future.  We've never had a moister or more flavorable ham.  THIS IS FANTASTIC. I bought a 4lb. ham and cooked it on low for 4 1/2 hours and it turned out perfect.

Now this sounds good - I've not tried it yet, but it has a touch of originality to it, so it will be put to the test at the weekend. Watch out for my judgement some time next week :) As usual, I will not be sparing in my compliments or criticisms!!

Super easy, great segway to a wonderful dinner.  I used a spiral ham.  Mixed brown sugar and pineapple juice.  Cooked on low for 4 hours.  I did cover the meat with tinfoil and then put the crockpot lid over.  Worked great.

I wanted a EASY way to make my ham this year... This fit the bill.  With all the great reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. WOW ~ this is the best ham I've ever had.  The family raved about how good it was.  I bought the CHEAPEST ham I could find.  This ham comes out so tender and juicy... I really don't think you need to spend the extra money on the sprial cut. But thats just my .2 cents.    ENJOY!

I used a picnic ham and put crushed pineapple with the juice on top after packing some brown sugar on it.  This was the best ham I've ever had and it was so easy.  It probably cooked for 8 hours on low which seems like a long time, but when we were ready to eat the ham was so juicy and tender.  It melted in my mouth!

I have been using this recipe for a while now and keep forgetting to review.  Everyone I have served it to loves it and usually requests the recipe.  It's almost embarrassing to share - it's so easy.  It is, by far, the best ham recipe I've tried.

I don't have the heart to give this recipe a negative star rating; all things considered.  However, I will tell people my experience with it just in case it helps someone out.  First and foremost, make sure you determine the size of ham you will need based on the size of your crock pot!  I thought that my slow cooker was much bigger than it really was. SURPRISE, an 8lb ham would NOT fit into it.  I had to slice half frozen meat off the bone; it took about 2 hours.   My husband was concerned I didn't add any water.  I am glad I did not as it made more than enough liquid on its own.  I did add 2 juiced oranges, cloves, and honey, which smelled nice.  Here's the part I didn't get: We weren't 100% it was done when it was done.  The meat turned gray near the top.  My husband seems to think it had something to do with being near the top where the oxygen can get through the lid.  I don't know.

Not what I was expecting at all. It had no flavor unfortunately. I really thought this would be excellent, if I was ever to make this again I would have to have some gravy with it for some flavor.

used exact 8 lb. bone in butt ham... per the butcher cured...followed instructions except put a tiny bit cherry juice in the bottom. Had to cut the ham to fit..used tin foil as suggested in other reviews. The juices overflowed my crockpot several times.The ham did not look cooked at 6hrs  so cooked for 8 as suggested....then it was over cooked. The ham shredded into pieces instead of being able to be sliced. I am a ham lover. Neither my husband or myself liked it. Won't make it this way ever again. I will bake it next time. Dissapointed.

Made this for Christmas. This was my first time making a ham. My ham was like 70% fat and unedibale But the parts I could eat were really good. I think instead of picnic bone ham Im going to try center cut ham. I bought a 8 pounder and it was a big waste of money;/

The BEST ham I've ever had!!!   

This has become a staple at my home for the holidays!  My family loves it and every time that I cook it there are never any left overs!!   I cooked it exactly as written.  If I cannot get the ham to fit into my crockpot, I cover the crockpot with tin foil and then put the cover over it as best that I can.   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!

I wasn't sure how this recipe was going to come out because I placed my ham in the slower cooker frozen. Everything worked out well. Ham was nice and juicy and very easy to cook. Would make again!

This is great.  Is even better with 1/2 cup honey drizzled on top (in addition to the brown sugar) and about 6-8 whole cloves stuck in it!  YUMMY!  Everyone loved it!

It didn't turn out quite like I had hoped.  While it was easy, I was hoping for it to be sweeter, but it seemed all the brown sugar didn't really stick, it kinda melted all over when it got hot.  Even though I repeatedly scooped up the liquidy brown sugar and spooned it over the ham, it didn't seem to hold...

This recipe is great because it's *so* easy, and turns out delicious.  We just use a precooked, boneless ham in the slow cooker and I've used a few whole cloves or some pineapple slices if I want to alter the flavor a little bit.   This one's going in the family archive.  Thanks!

Since my family loves my baked ham, I was a little worried about the slow cooker method.  I also added a can of chunk pineapple to the top.  I drained most of the liquid before adding it.  
This turned out wonderfull.  Very easy

This was very tasty.  I will cut down the sugar next time as it was too sweet for us.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 star is you can't make a good gravy to go with the mashed potatoes.

I'm not a big fan of ham but I made this for Thanksgiving last year because the turkey wasn't going to be enough for my big family and they all seemed to really like it.  The only thing that didn't seem right is that it was more like a pulled pork after cooking that long than hunks of ham.  I also added a can of pineapple slices with the juice to the slow cooker cause that's how the family likes it.

Amazing recipe!  So easy and so tasty.  The liquid in the crockpot was delicious drizzled over the ham pieces.  Next time I'll make this a day ahead so I can chill the liquid and skim off the fat before serving.

I made this for our Christmas dinner, and we were not disappointed.  My son, who is not usually crazy about ham, asked to take the leftover ham home!  Using the crockpot also freed the oven for making the side dishes.

Wonderful ham! I used a bone-in ham, and it seemed to give a smoke flavor (kids weren't super fond of this). It was so easy and tasted so good. Very tender! Will be making this a lot! Thanks!

Great way to cook a ham and so very easy.
Word of warning to those who like to take the ham bone and make ham and beans;
this is not the recipe for you. The meat just falls off the bone and there is nothing left on the bone.

I am not a huge fan of ham but my husband is so we tried this as a special treat for him and I am now a ham lover!!!!  I cannot tell you how good this was - so tender and flavorful and so easy!!  We did make the mistake of buying a spiral sliced ham and the pieces were not big enough, we would have liked bigger chunks because it was sooo tender.  Definitely a keeper!!

With only two ingredients, this one is hard to screw up !!  Add to that the convenience of putting it in the crockpot before work to cook it, and you have a super easy, tasty dinner.  We used a boneless 3lb ham but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Came out great - will definitely make again !!

I have to admit, I couldn't put my head around the fact that this simple, simple recipe could be so good.  I don't think I'll make a ham any other way from now on.  It was so incredibly easy and delicious!!!  I might try studding the ham with a few cloves the next time, but tonight I made it exactly as posted and it was great!!!

Fabulous recipe! I have used it several times.  Please do not forgot to keep an eye on it.  I burned it up by getting busy with other things on Christmas. It was not a good day for me.  If your ham says fully cooked it needs to be warmed to temp, but not cooked.  Don't get too busy you are not keeping an eye on this ham in the crock pot.  I would suggest low setting and then warm.  When I cooked it properly my brother in law said it was one of the best hams he had ever tasted, and he is not free with compliments with me.

This is so easy! I have made it with just the brown sugar. I have also mixed a few squirts of Dijon mustard and a can of whole jellied cranberries with the brown sugar that is added on top to jazz it up. It was good both times. This is a good, easy Sunday ham to prepare. This last time I cooked it on high 2 hours and low 1 hour. I switched it to low just when I put my cheesy potatoes in the oven and the timing was perfect. This was delicious with steamed carrots and green beans, and the cheesy potatoes. This is my go-to method for preparing an inexpensive ($8) bone-in shank cut ham that Aldi carries during the colder season.

I just made this ham for Easter, and it turned out great!  It's a wonderful option for freeing up the oven for all of the sides.  I had already bought my smoked, spiral sliced ham before I read all of the recommendations to NOT use this type of ham!!  It actually turned out fine.  I had a 9 lb ham -- next time I will get an 8 lb ham -- because it just barely fit in the crockpot.  I did use the advice of others who said that the lid didn't fit on theirs as well so they wrapped aluminum foil around the top and sides. I did this and it seemed to work fine.  I also cut the total time -- I cooked it on low for 4 hours.  I didn't baste it b/c I was too lazy to undo the foil!! But the ham turned out juicy and hot and everybody loved it!!  I will definitely use this recipe again but my changes will be:  slightly smaller ham and cook on low for 3 hours instead of 4.

Best.  Ham.  Ever.
I used a 7lb Boars Head Sweet Slice boneless smoked ham, 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar on the bottom and topped with Boars Head Brown Sugar & Spice Ham glaze.  Cooked on low for 7 hours.  PERFECTION!

Excellent and supper easy recipe! If you use a spiral cut ham, heat on low for only a couple of hours. Served it for Christmas Dinner, and it was delicious!. Now to figure out how to the left over juices for soup...

So delicious!  So easy!  Popped my 9lb spiral ham in at 1pm on Christmas Eve and went about my day with other meal prep etc.  By the time we returned from an early mass (4pm) dinner was ready!!  Lots of happy tummies!

Wow, just 2 ingredients made the best ham I've ever made.  I bought my ham at Publix, their brand, and it only had 3% solution, so it wasn't salty at all but good flavor.  The brown sugar was perfect.

the reviews made me try this dish a lot were excellent but when they were bad it was flip of a coin, I noticed that a few their low setting was 6hrs I think it is a newer crock pot higher heat and fast cooking, shredded ham and dried it out.
I made it with old fashion smoked ham
my crock pot has setting for slow 10 hrs its an old Rival
smart pot I bought a long time ago and I have used it a lot
when I was working full time with children. I use to prepare my food in the evening put it outside in the winter bring it back in the morning turn it on 10hrs dinner was done when I got home, also great to use on hot summer days not heating up house like the oven does, I prep it and put into the fridge . Don't blame the recipe for fast cooking crock pot. I rubbed the ham with Dijon mustard and followed recipe and cooking time.
my ham sliced perfectly it did not shred, it melted in our mouths, juicy and tender

I was surprised how well this worked.  Since I had a half-ham (about 5 pounds) I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and reduced the time to 6 hours. 

Based on other reviews, I also added a small can of crushed pineapple and a splash of cider vinegar, to cut the sweetness and brighten the flavor.

The prep was extremely simple of course, but it was a bit of a pain to slice and trim, mainly because I wanted to get rid of all the fat.  I was also surprised to find how salty the resulting sauce was.  It's really too salty to use.  The flavor of the ham turns out great, and the sauce is tasty but salty.  If I make it again I won't actually save the sauce, just keep a spoon or two to moisten the ham for storage.

Can't imagine the people who's ham came out bad.  Some said the brown sugar burnt on the bottom and no juice.  I tried to load a pic of mine but it wouldn't load up.  My ham came out perfect.  I did the brown sugar but added pineapple tidbits and a 1/2 cup of pineapple juice.  I used a smoked butt portion ham and cooked 2 hours on high and then put it on low for about 2.  It came out perfect and very tasty.  Will be doing my ham this way for now on.

It may have been the ham, but this was not the best or close to it. I cooked it less time, because 8hrs seemed like so long and glad I did. Think I will try a different brand of ham next time.

SO good! Def making this again. I used a 4lb picnic ham with one and a half cups of brown sugar,  put honey, splash of orange juice and sliced pineapple. I also cut back on the cooking time. Brand new crockpot on low for about 4.5 hours. Even better the next day as some ham sandwiches yummmmm!

Although this said you can use a spiral cut ham, I wouldn't recommend it.  I cooked a ten pound Kirkland ham; cooked it 6 hours and it was still overdone.

this was perfect, I did about 10lb bone in pork shoulder picnic ham. Did everything the same except when it had cooked 8 hours on low, turned the ham over and cooked 3 more hours. I literally fell off the bone, so tender and juicy, thank you so much for the recipe,  LITTLEMSTXTHANG.

Ham with bone in was too large for my cooker to close, so we cut the bone out, but left it in the pot.   The time to cook is way too long, and our ham was excellent but very sweet and overcooked.  I will not do this one again.

Wow - this was horrible! I followed the directions and put an expensive ham in for 8 hours on low in my crock pot.  Result?  Totally burned ham when I came home from work.  What a waste of money!  H Maybe 2-3 hours max would work.

I used a 9 1/2# spiral honey ham. I put a little brown sugar on the bottom of the crock pot and put the ham in cut side down. I didn't add any liquid. I then put some more brown sugar over the top. I used the low 8 hr setting. After 3 1/2 hours I switched it up to 4 hr high setting. I put the glaze on that came with the ham, and let it go for about a 1/2 hour. I have a large size crock pot so I didn't have to use foil or anything; it fit in perfectly. The end result was a delicious ham that I would make again in a heartbeat. Great flavor, moist. And best of all stress free! :-)

This was the BEST ham and my whole family LOVED it! I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was wonderful but then I tried different things instead of the brown sugar (honey and crushed pineapple, for example) and it has turned out wonderfully every time. The juices make a great soup base, so be sure to save them!
If my ham doesn't fit I simply cover it tightly with foil and this recipe still works great!

This ham was pretty good, I was disappointed that it wasn't as flavorful as some of the other reviews said. It was moist, but the brown sugar didn't add much. I used a 3 lb. ham with the 2 cups required in the recipe. I used a slow cooker liner, which I would definitely recommend for this recipe so your slow cooker isn't a mess afterwards.

Without a doubt, this was the most delicious, most tender ham I've ever tasted. I made no changes to the recipe provided. I served to guests the weekend before Christmas and it was an instant hit. Little did they know how easy it was to prepare. Thanks for this recipe!

I was skeptical and would never have tried this ham if it weren't for the glowing reviews. My whole family was so glad I made this Christmas Day! It was the easiest ham I ever made, and was absolutely delicious! Because of the review warnings about a spiral drying out, I began basting it halfway through the 4-hour spiral cooking time. This worked very well in keeping the ham moist, and I think it added to the brown sugar flavor of the meat. A wonderful recipe - I have tried many - but this will be my go-to from now on! I plan to try it soon with an uncut ham for comparison, but I don't see how you can possibly go wrong. I followed the recipe exactly, by the way.

Hands Down The Best Ham EVER!!!
I used a pre-cooked ham, used the 2 cups of Brown sugar as advised but I pinned Pineapple rings with toothpicks to the ham. I poured about a quarter of the pineapple juice into the crock-pot and Oh My Goodness it was so tender and juicy. I prepared it the night before and plugged it first thing in the morning, I cooked on high for 3-4 hours. You wont regret it, It's outstanding! I made it on thanksgiving and Christmas and it was a big hit!!

For this recipe I used a 9 lb, Maple Smoked, uncooked, bone-in ham. I used 2 cans of pineapple slices, poured the juice of the first can into the bottom and mixed with brown sugar before adding the ham. I then covered the ham in brown sugar and pineapple slices, covered it in tin foil, put the lid on and cooked it on low for about 4 1/2 hours. About half way through I followed another persons review and transferred much of the liquid to a pot, added about two TBSP of cornstarch, 1 tsp of ground cloves and the remaining pineaple juice, cooked for about 15 minutes until it was nice and thick and then basted the ham with it and continued cooking. This turned out great! Next time I may reduce the time to 4 hours but otherwise wouldn't change a thing!

I added a cup of pineapple juice and 1/4 cup of real maple syrup to top the ham.  I never made a ham before, with my Christmas crew coming here for dinner, I was on a wing and a prayer! It was bar-none the BEST I ever had! Tender, juicy and full of flavor, it will now be a regular in this house :)

This is the first time I've tried to cook something in the slow cooker where the lid wouldn't fit, so I viewed this as an experiment.  I found nothing labeled "picnic ham" -- I used a spiral sliced cured ham with bone in.  I checked the fit in the slow cooker before I unwrapped it.  I followed the directions, wrapped the entire thing in extra-wide foil (opening on top) and covered it all up with more foil in place of the lid as tightly as I could manage.  I had my doubts but this humongous hunk of meat turned out amazing.

I had a 12 lb ham to cook for Christmas dinner but didnt want to use my tiny oven. I cut the ham in half and used my two slow cookers, Ran out of brown sugar so I added 1 1/2 cups brown sugar with 1/2 cup splenda and it tastes amazing!!! Perfect for my mom who is a diabetic.

This is so Delicious!  I like to add a bag of frozen string beans and some quartered potatoes doing the last two hours...with a nice sprinkling of salt and pepper on top.  Such a warm, homey, delicious, comfort meal.

It is the only way that I cook a ham.  However, I brush lightly with prepared mustard before rubbing it wih the brown sugar.  Like the tartness that you get.

I've never made a ham before and this one got rave reviews at Thanksgiving.  I couldn't find a ham that wasn't already cooked but I picked up a bone in ham, put it in the slow cooker for about 20 minutes per pound and it was amazing.

So so good!!! And easy!!! I wanted something easy to make and this was perfect. I told my fiancé that we were having ham for dinner and he said that he didn't really like ham. He is a notoriously picky eater. Well, I made him a plate when it was done and he not only cleared his plate but he wanted it again the next week. Great recipe, wouldn't change a thing!

Was very good and easy.  Followed the recipe and since I had a few pineapple chunks leftover, I threw them on top.  Loved it! But watch the time-I had a 5.5 lb ham and after 4 hours it was a bit dry.

I used a Hormel 21 ham with bone-in.  Added a can of crushed pineapple, along with a few cloves.  Wrapped in foil for about 4 hours on high.  This was the best ham and was soooooooo super easy!!!!  Will use again!  Thanks!

I made this for Christmas. My family raved over it.  I didn't have much left over.  We were able to enjoy the day without me being in the kitchen.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The meat was flavorful and tender.  I was concerned about the sugar burning but it turned into a nice bath for the ham.  I will make this again.  Great recipe.

We prepared this adding raw honey all over the top, then sprinkled smoked paprika, basil, and toasted onion powder.  After cooking for 8 hours, we shredded and added a thick and bold style BBQ sauce. Made some pretty amazing sandwiches for a pot luck dinner.

This ham was so juicy and tender. The only change I made was adding pinapple slices as with the traditional ham and used some of the pinapple juice to baste. With yeast rolls, green bean casserole and yams it did not last long at all. Didn't even have enough left over for ham sandwiches the next day. The family said it was the best I have ever made.

I was looking for a recipe that was simple, yet delicious so I tried this one.  I used a smoked ham butt and it turned out great--very tender and delicious.  I am gettting ready to make it again.  This time for our church supper.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

WOW!!!!! what a great recipe.  Made this for Christmas, it was so simple and easy to make put it on and forget it.  The one thing that my family decided was that it does not need the whole time that it states to cook in the recipe.  We could barely get it out of the slow cooker as it was falling apart so easily, so I think half the time will do and thats what we will try next time.  I think the time would be fine if you were't using an already cured ham.  Thanks for a simple and tasty recipe

Being new to the USA, it was unusual for me to buy a whole, fully cooked ham... I was sceptical that this would work out, using just brown sugar, but on Christmas Day early i put this on to cook and crossed my fingers... It was DELICIOUS! So simple, thank you so much... I may try a more adventurous ham recipe in future but this was delicious and complimented the christmas feast very well. The liquor left in the crock was great in the gravy, it made it SO tasty!

OMG...way tasty. I made this for Christmas dinner this year and was relly afraid that it would turn out super dry. It was absolutely to die for, and we added pineapples too FYI.

This was the juiciest ham I've ever had. And it was so incredibly easy. I needed to cook a ham but didn't have time after work, so I turned to my slow cooker. i was also worried about the lack of liquid, but when I came home after 12 hours, the juice almost covered the ham. The meat nearly fell apart as I plated it. This was so delicious and easy, I'm definitely making it again.

I used this recipe for my New Year's Eve party, and it was absolutely delicious - I added maple syrup, cinnamon, and a few tangerines that I peeled and sliced and added to the pot.  I cooked it for 6 hours, and it was very tender.  All my guests commented on how good it was.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, which I shall definitely cook again.

I used a 1 kg (about 2.2 lbs) ham... I was nervous about time/everything from previous reviews and because I only just got my slow cooker (no exp w/one).  My husband said this is the best meal he's ever had.  Since I have a 6 ltr slow cooker I got nervous about it being so empty, 1 hr in I added whole peeled potatoes and 4 carrots (peeled/sliced), also added about 1 cup boiling water at this time to help veggies cooked, move meat on top of carrots.  sprinkled a tiny bit more brown sugar on the whole lot and closed the lid (I only used about 1/3 cup brown sugar initially), was incredible!! So if 1 kg ham, 6 ltr new slow cooker = 6 1/2 hours on low.  And feel free to add in the veg.  thx for this recipe.  Ham is the biggest dish here in Ireland and you just made it even nicer!! :)

My ham was very dried out.  I cooked for 5 hours on low.  I did forget to put it flat side down and put the sugar on the bottom.  I did what another person did and put some pineapple juice in the bottom.  I think maybe 3 or 4 hours would have been fine.

This is a great way to free oven space. I have had experiences with my crockpots of various brands to cook at different temps. I have one that cooks at nearly a rolling boil!! (That one's for my beans and stews) This has a lot to do also with the problems of getting that funky brown color and turning rubbery. So be aware of your devices cooking habits, and this recipe is a great "no-brainer"!! Delicious!

This is such a great and easy recipe. I used a 2lb turkey ham (straight from the freezer) and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Even though the recipe didn't call for it I used a bit of water (about a 1/4 cup). I let I cook for about 2 hr on low and then another hour on high. I turned it and basted it in the juice pretty frequently. When it was done, I cut a piece for my mum and she raved about how soft it was. I was a little concerned that it'd be too sweet but nope it was not. Can't wait to see how it'll taste cold, it was excellent hot. A++

This was phenomenal!  However "you might have to trim it a little to make it fit" was an utter understatement.  I didn't want use foil over the top so i just kept hacking till it would all fit.  My slow cooker cooks really hot, so i turned it to "warm" an hour early.  PERFECTION!!  i did baste it about 3 times.  not sure if it really made a diff or not.  making again this weekend for family in town!  thanks!

I mixed some pineapple juice and brown sugar for a glaze because I was worried about it not being juicy enough but it was very juicy. Even my Father in law who NEVER ate anything I cooked (because of his "delicate palate" ate 3 pieces. Now he asks what's for dinner all the time...  I did have to cover my crock pot with aluminum foil because my ham was so large but by the time everyone ate and made sandwiches the next day there was none left. Next time I'll have to make 2 so I have left overs for potato soup.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it.  It was very easy to make and smelled up the whole house.  I used a 9.5 Lb Hickory Smoked Ham Shank Portion from Sobey's (it was the only store that had a ham with the bone in it, plus their is no portion of Ham labled picnic ham).  It doesn't fit in my crock pot so I have to cut a portion off and place it on top and cover the whole thing with half the brown sugar and tin foil.  I also press down of the ham though out the cooking time to try to get more of it to fit in as it cooks.  Other wise I follow the recipe exacty, 7-8 hours depending on if my hubby can wait that long with the smell of Ham in the air!  (We also like this recipe because the dog get the bone when we are done.)

This made a very nice ham and was so easy. I think it had great flavor for a slow cooked ham. After it was done cooking, I sliced the ham and placed it back in the crock pot to soak up the juices and it was delicious!

Really good. All of my family loved it. I'll do it again for sure, but probably cut back on the brown sugar and add some pineapple juice as it needed more liquid.

This was so easy and delicious.  I used a 7 1/2 pound boned in butt portion ham.  It turned out juicy and tender.  I cooked it for about 6 hours.  All crockpots are different.  The sauce was really good to serve over the sliced ham.   This is the only way I will make ham from now on!

I just did this for Christmas and it was fabulous.   I had a 10 lb ham and it only took 6 hours - so be careful of timing so that it is not dried out.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar.  Everyone ( a total of 11 people) loved the ham and there wasn't very much left at the end of the dinner.  My mother-in-law said that she never had a piece of ham melt in her mouth like this did.    How about that.  I think that I will try a mustard combination next time - mustard, brown sugar and spices.

Add some pineapples & cherries and you've got perfection! This is a perfect easy holiday recipe. The taste and the convenience of this recipe make it five stars in my eyes. I like that I can throw it in the slow cooker and forget it until it's time to eat.

We've made this recipe multiple times over the years, and my father still can't enough of it.  It's extremely easy and very flavourful and frees up my oven for the turkey!

I was looking for an easy recipe for ham in the slow cooker, and this was it!  It came out pretty good, though 2 cups of sugar seemed like a lot so I used half and ended up wishing I used it all because it needed it. I also think eight hours was a bit long, next time I think I will take it out after seven.  Overall it was juicy and good.

OH MY  this was AMAZING.    Bar none the best ham I have ever had.  I will be serving it to friends this weekend.    Seriously, I kept wanting to eat more and more but eventually got to embarrassed to fill my plate YET AGAIN.  I will be serving a dry un-oaked reisling from Purite.

This was amazing! Followed the recipe, but lowered brown sugar to 1-1/2 cups. Thanks to previous reviews I did not add extra water. I used a 5-1/2 lb semi-boneless ham, and the few leftovers were gone before the night's end. My guests asked for the recipe...how easy!!!!  Thanks for a wonderful new dinner idea!

Every ham I've ever baked in the oven has dried out.  This method was so much better--the meat was juicy and flavorful!  I added a can of pineapple chunks--next time I'll drain off the juice, as the extra liquid was unnecessary.  I might sprinkle some ground cloves in with the brown sugar next time....Very good method.  Thanks!

Growing up in a vegetarian family, I had never cooked a ham before.  This was my first for my husband's family for Easter.  It was a hit.  I'll make (and eat) it again!  Very good. Very easy.

This ham was awesome!  I made it for my first Easter dinner and it got rave reviews.  I used a 9lb spiral cut smoked ham, and since it was already cooked, it was actually ready after 3.5 hours on low.  I will definitely make this again!

Wow! This recipe is so simple that I thought it might be too good to be true. Boy was I wrong! It was incredible! I couldn't find a picnic ham, so I used a bone in smoked ham and cooked it for 4 hours on the 8 hour-low setting. It came out perfect. Not dry, great flavor. Thanks for the wonderful and easy recipe!

This recipe was delicious. However the ham I got was too big for the slow cooker, so I put the ham in a pan covered with aluminum foil and baked it at 325 for the same time. It came out great!

This ham was fantastic.  It was moist and a little sweet just how I like it.  the only thing I did different was to add a little bourbon in with it.  I will definately be making this over and over again.

Easy.  It worked well with a spiral ham but you do have to make sure not to overheat it.  I didn't read the recipe correctly or I would have used the bone in as it recommended.  It was great anyway!

This is a great recipe. My husband is in the Navy and we are stationed in Japan. They dont really believe in ovens so many homes do not come with one and if you are lucky you get one the size of a microwave. So this slow cooker recipe was great since I had no room for a small turkey and a small ham in my oven. The ham was so moist and fell apart. It was very popular among the guys.Thanks for the recipe!

I used a spiral ham and poured a small (8 oz)can of pineapple chunks and then patted on the remaining brown sugar.  I'm aware that sprial ham is already cooked so I put it on low for only about 3 hours.  I basted by spooning the liquid and pineapple over it every half hour or so. I liked it and I'm not really a fan of ham.

I made this last yesterday.  I have a small crock pot.  6 people were eating the ham.  I purchased a (no bone) Black Forest 5.5 lb ham and trimmed about 1/2 lb. in order to fit it into the crock pot.  Other than that, I followed the recipe but cut the time back to about 5.5 hours due to the size of the ham and basted it periodically by tipping the crock pot over a bowl and dumping the melted sugar into the bowl and then pouring it back over the ham.  This worked well and our guests requested the recipe.  Thank you for an easy wonderul recipe.

Added juice from a jar of maraschino cherries and a little pineapple juice per other reviewers suggestions and then it was absolutely awesome.

I thought this was great!  Didn't have to warm the house up on a nice day.  Used a 4 lb. boneless ham.  I also was worried as there wasn't much liquid coming from the ham and the brown sugar on top started to harden.  So about midway through cooking, I poured a can of chunk pineapple and a jar of maraschino cherries over the top.  Yummy!  Thickened the sauce (after removing the ham) with a bit of cornstarch and it made for a nice glaze/dipping sauce.  I might try this recipe with a pork roast and just use some extra seasonings.

Wow! I've baked numerous hams and was worried but needed my oven for other items. I followed the directions exactly (except I used a 7lb boneless ham) and it turned out great. My friends couldn't believe it came out of the crockpot. I'll never bake another ham!

Everyone loved this simple ham that took hardly any effort at all. I can't even remember what type of ham it was, but the bone and some of the meat are in the freezer for ham and bean soup. The brown sugar on the bottom glazed that side of the ham, giving it a dark, yet tender and sweet flavor. I tossed in some pineapple slices and some of the pineapple juice. I was home, so every couple of hours I basted the exposed portion of the ham. We will be using this recipe over and over. I may even offer to do a ham for Thanksgiving or Christmas knowing I can use this recipe and not stress out.

This ham was perfect.  I made it for my family.  I had NO leftovers, including the bone, because my dad asked to take it home to use it to make beans!!  It was so tender, it practically melted in my mouth.  I will always make my ham this way from now on.

This was extremely easy and tasty.  Made lots of juice.  Very tender - lots of pieces fell apart- made it tougher to serve.  Be sure not to keep on warm setting too long.

Good! It didnt make the house smell good like when baking a ham. My ham did not fit in the crockpot and I didnt have a knife that would cut off the bone as reccommended, so I put a pyrex bowl over the top(it fit perfectly and no steam seeped out) I checked the temp halfway through and it was cooking just fine, I turned the ham over a couple of times. I also added a can of pineapple chunks. I will cook this way again, eps. when needing to free up the oven.

This ham is awesome!  We were looking for a way to cook both turkey & ham on Christmas with only one oven, but I wanted to try the recipe first, in case we didn't like it.  This is the best tasting ham I think I've ever had!  It's incredibly moist and sweet; my husband said it tasted like a honey-baked ham.  Even my 7-year-old, who believe me is the pickiest eater EVER (he doesn't even like pizza!) tasted it and loves it!  He normally won't eat ham, but he & his 3-year-old brother can't stop picking at it!  This will definitely be on our dinner table for Christmas, as well as Easter!

Made this for dinner last night. It was very juicy and tender. But it didnt have that  pop that I thought it might .  I added a can of drained pineapple just att he end to heat them through.  Was expecting something a bit more i think .  with all the rave reviews. I will cook this way again . But next time I think it needs some spices. ir maybe even just a bit of mustard.  Was just ok . ty

This was great! I'll never do my ham in the oven again! I did add a can of drained pineapple chunks, and there was plenty of juice. Next time I'll bring the time to about 6 hours, I think the low setting on my crock pot just cooks higher than other crock pots. Very good and great ham sandwiches later! In the Southwest we try not to use our ovens so much in the summer so I love great crockpot recipes that make cooking so easy!

Excellent! Made it for Easter..I just had a spiral ham, but next time I would use just a regular ham. I also used one of those new slow-cooker liners, and the brown suger didn't burn, and clean-up was so easy! The meat was so tender..sweet and smokey at the same time. A winner!

Easy. Simple. Delicious. You can't go wrong with this amazing recipe. I had to trim my 9 lb. ham to fit my 5 qt. crockpot, used a little less brown sugar than 2 cups. It was absolutely YUMMY ... the meat fell off the bone, the juice was perfect to add to my side of mashed potatoes. Yummy leftovers.

I don't care for ham and decided to try this for my husband and son and could not stop eating it!  The sauce this makes is perfect.  Not too salty and not too sweet and the cooking process could not be any easier.  I took it to a gathering and assured my fellow "ham haters" it was worth a taste and they loved it!  I used teh bone and leftovers for soup.

ARGH!!!  The ham I bought was bigger than my crockpot, even after trimming.  We ended up cutting the ham off the bone and putting large ham chunks into the crockpot instead.  I sprinkled the last 1/2 cup of brown sugar over the top of everything.  After 8 hours, it was very good!!!!!!

Delish, I used a Smithfield butt. Don't like a lot of additives as I use the bone and unappealing pieces, freezing them for future use, green beans, collards or dried beans.

What a simple trick to perk up plain ham! I've used this with ham steaks too. Rub a light layer of brown sugar on top of each slice. For a crowd, you can layer slices in a roaster and bake that way.

Didn't fit in my crock pot so I covered with tin foil.  Basted a few times during cooking time and everyone at the party LOVED it!

This is for  Debbym: 
A picnic ham is a cut of pork taken from the pig's front legs, and it includes part of the shoulder. While a true ham may be on or off the bone, a picnic ham is traditionally on the bone. Picnic hams do taste a bit more like ham than other pork cuts because they're smoked.Jan 1, 2016.

I bought a precooked 9 1/2 pound smoked shank ham. I had to trim both sides just a bit for it to fit in my crock pot and then just put the trimmed pieces in where they would fit. I put brown sugar on bottom of dish. Then put the ham in and put brown sugar over the top, drizzled 1/4 cup of raw honey over that and sprinkled ground cloves over that and finally pineapple slices. Then I poured just a bit of pineapple juice over that. I know this is totally different than the recipe and I apologize. I put foil over the top of the ham and tucked it in then another piece of foil over it again covering the crock pot itself and then just sat the lid on top of that. As it cooked the lid did eventually come to rest on the rim of the crock pot. I set the temp manually to high and cooked it for 4 1/2 hours. It was beautiful when my son took it out to slice. It didn't turn brown at all. The taste was delicious! The sweetness was just right and it was very moist and juicy. I will definitely make my hams this way from now on!

I have been making this recipe for years. Except, I use 1/2 cup brown sugar, an 8-9 pound spiral ham, and cook on low 3-4 hours. Not everyone in my family likes "sweet meat", so this gives the brown sugar lovers a great sweetened ham at the bottom, then plain at the top. It's always moist and good.

Delicious! I've made it twice with spiral cut ham. The first time, a Christmas ham was already brown sugar coated and in foil, so I put it the crockpot on its side and cooked wrapped in its foil on low for about two hours. I covered the crockpot top with foil, then laid the lid over that to keep in as much heat as possible. This time, I put my own brown sugar and just a little water in the bottom. Laying on its side gets most of the ham under the lid since the slices make it more flexible. Once again, I covered the crockpot with foil, then put the lid on as best I could. Both times the ham was tender and juicy. 2 to 2 1/2 hours is plenty of cooking for a precook end, spiral cut ham. You just want it to get hot and no more. I'll probably never cook any other way or serve a cold ham again!

Made as written except I added 1/4 cup water, which was not needed. Used a Cook's bone-in, not spiral sliced. Everyone agreed it was the excellent. Used only 1/2 cup brown sugar and that was plenty.

Delicious, easy and perfect! Used a small 2.5 lb ham (for 2 people) and adjusted the brown sugar (around 2 Tb). Cooked around 1.5 hours.  Checked to make sure it wasn't dried out, then kept in warm mode till ready to eat!

Highly recommend cutting down the cook time like most reviews recommended. I had a 3.6lb bone in ham and I cooked it for a little over 4 hours and out was cooked perfectly. I changed the recipe up a bit by rubbing spicy brown mustard all over the ham before putting it in with all of the brien sugar. The bite mixed with the sweet was great.

This was a very  simple and no fuss way to cook a ham.  The ham was juicy and just wonderful!    I am looking forward to the holidays and not having to tie up the oven with our ham.

I used a honey spiral ham and only 1 cup of sugar (1/2 in the crock pot and half on the ham. Cooked for 3 hours as suggested by other reviewers. There was an additional (dry) packet for ham glaze. I prepared that, broiled the ham for 5 minutes and it was perfect.  The ham was tender, not dry and did not fall to pieces. A keeper.

Delicious!  I just made this for Easter this morning.  I used a 9 lb. pre-cooked spiral cut ham and I put it in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours.  I used the brown sugar and I also used a can of pineapple chunks with the juice.  ALL of us - including my 4 and 6 year old - LOVED it!  Thank you!

I agree with DebbyM that a smoked ham does turn brown and all weird lol. However, I don't feel it detracted from the overall taste or quality of the ham itself. Definitely not as aesthetically pleasing as a baked ham. It did fall apart but it just made less work for me. 
With that said, I think the recipe IS more geared towards a picnic ham and not a smoked one.  I'd still prefer a smoked ham in the oven, versus the slow cooker.

A relative made this and it was delicious but did fall apart rather than be sliceable.  But I tried it anyway and added some grainy mustard overtop as well as a drained can of chunk pineapple.  This time it was quite easy to slice.  It must depend on the cut of ham. Slow cookers rule!
Now 12/2017 and I have made this several times including today using a smoked, cured, fully cooked ham and once again it is a great way to heat it through and provide some nice flavor with the brown sugar.  I also used a couple of tbsp of mustard.  It did not fall apart but was nicely sliceable.

Our 11+ pound shank ham was too tall to fit into our large oval slow cooker. After adding only a portion of the brown sugar,  as suggested, I covered it with foil, secured the foil with a large rubber band and set it on low for 5-1/2 hours.  It was moist and delicious without falling apart and was easily sliced after removing it from the slow cooker to rest for over 20 minutes.  I was concerned that it would be too sweet, but it was perfect.  This is the only way I will cook a ham from now on.  "Set it and forget it!"

I'm not that crazy about ham, but thought I'd try it for one of my main dishes for my Xmas party. AWESOME!!!!!  I followed directions but didn't rub the brown sugar over the ham, just on the bottom. So tender, sooo tasty & so easy to make. I used a shank ham on the butchers recomendation. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for such a simple recipie & so delicious too.

This recipe is great!  It's very easy, and the end result is delicious.  I used a 5 pound picnic ham and cooked on low for 4 hours.  It turned out beautifully, with plenty of sweet sauce for scooping over the ham.  I will be making this again Christmas Day for company!

This was DELICIOUS!!! So moist, so juicy...even my 5-year-old asked for seconds and she never eats more than half of her original plate. I couldn't believe it when I saw that you could cook a ham in the slow cooker. And the result was beautiful!!! Didn't change anything about the recipe and I'm glad I didn't.

Wow!!! If I could give this 20 stars I would!! This was the first time I ever cooked a ham and it was the BEST ham I've ever had! I followed the recipe perfectly except it only needed to cook for 4 hours and not 8. I used a pre cooked bone in skinless butt ham and it was perfect!! So moist and lots of flavor!! I will never cook a ham any other way!!

I used a 12 lb shoulder ham, just my free one from the grocery store. It worked out great! It was very tender and juicy. My husband said it was the best ham he ever had!

I made this a couple of months ago and loved it, have made it again and having it tomorrow for Easter supper.  I used less sugar.  Makes excellent leftovers for casseroles or our favourite swiss cheese and ham omlette.

I used 1 1/2 C. of coconut pure sugar since my husband is diabetic.  I used a knife to cut the ham into spirals by cutting from the bottom clockwise & then I turned the ham & cut again to make the diamonds. I followed the recipe & put the flat part over the sugar in the bottom of the crock pot. I also put Dijon mustard over the top. Since I had a 9 lb. ham, which was too big for the pot, I placed aluminum foil over the top & the lid over the top & cooked it for four hours on low.  The ham was delicious & easy to cut. I will keep this recipe.

The meat was chewy and stringy. All the fat cooked away . I could not serve it. I did not care for this.

Our oven was out of commission so I wondered if I could find a slow cooker recipe. Thank goodness I found this one! Being me I had to improvise just a bit so added a can of pineapple chunks for extra moisture and sprinkled the top with ground cloves on top of the brown sugar. I will NEVER make a ham any other way again!! Thanks  LITTLEMSTXTHANG :-)

This is unbelievable! Often hard to get ham to fit. Thanksgiving I covered w foil and kitchen towel. Usually I end up getting the same Ham from target- it's already precooked so it doesn't take as long to cook!
We all love the ease and taste!!fabulous !

Wanted to try this ham for Easter because it's always so stressful juggling church, spending an hour driving to and from the inlaws, then getting home in enough to cook my ham in the oven. Was excited to just put it in the crock pot before hand and not having to worry about it. Got my usual 8# butt portion, studded it with some cloves, laid it in crock over some brown sugar (not sure how much I used), put a little more on top and cooked for about 5 hours before pouring some pineapple juice over it. Wanted to make gravy with it as I do with the oven version, but didn't want all the sugar in the juice to burn. As everyone else has said, the ham turns out dark but tastes great. It probably definitely doesn't need to cook as long; mine was borderline dry. While I felt like the flavor of the cloves was better infused in this recipe than when I make my ham in the oven and it was so easy, I probably won't make it this way again because the gravy was awful. But if gravy isn't important, definitely give this ham a try. You can't beat the simplicity.

I agree with Debbym about the type of ham.  Mine was smoked also. It was ok but dry.  Maybe I left it too long in my slow cooker. I will get a picnic ham next time.....however, it sure was easy:)

I followed the recipe completely except for the addition of cloves per other reviewers.  Thank God I did that because it gave the ham flavor it would not otherwise have had.  I disliked the fact that it turned the "ham" into "pulled pork".  And crockpot prepared meat seems to all be the same when completed...a shredded version of whatever it starts out as...with a "boiled" taste.  What a disappointment!  Thank goodness it was just prepared for my husband and I, being Easter, I would have been very embarrassed to serve this ham to anyone else!  I'm forcing myself to use the remaining ham in other ways...I just don't like to waste food.  I plan to make split pea soup, pork tacos, etc. anything to use up the meat.  Never again!   :(

It's probably not fair of  me to give this only three stars....the taste was very good, but the ham was a bit rubbery. I believe it was because it was in the crock way too long; I did follow others' suggestions about a boneless, spiral ham and planned on doing it on low for about four hours (I had a 9# ham). The problem was, two of our guests were over an hour late, and it threw us all off. I should have shut the crock pot off when they arrived and didn't. The ham would have stayed plenty warm. My bad! I think it would've been much better had I done that, and I am only reviewing now to warn others off of my mistake! I plan on trying this again next time we have a party, and hope to update with the stars this cooking method deserves.

This was a really good recipe, easy, low effort and delicious. I used a 6 lb shank end (not spiral cut) ham, cooked on high for 4 hours. I also added a can of cubed pineapple with the juice because I like cooked pineapple with ham. It turned out really moist and tender, but a bit sweet. I think the next time I make it I'll cut the sugar in half but keep the pineapple and juice. Really yummy.

I made this for Easter dinner.  It was great!!!  I used a 9.5 pound spiral cut, hickory smoked ham.  I took the advice of all the other reviewers and put the slow cooker on low for 5 hours.  An hour before the ham was done, I poured the juice over the top and injected it into the ham.  My husband said it reminded him of when he was a child going to the "pot luck" dinners when all the "ladies" could cook!  Thank you for this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly-- it gets one star less than five just because it probably needed some herbs or seasoning.  But the other stars are for the ease of cooking and because it turned out well, especially for the amount of work it DIDN'T take!

This couldn't have been easier, and turned out great!  My husband loved it, and kept going back for more.  My dad loved it, too.. we all did.  Will be my "go to" recipe for ham!

Very good and easy made on Christmas... Now was asked to bring the ham on Easter everyone loved it...

Used a precooked spiral cut ham, cook it for a much shorter time than the recipe indicates. I used a 9.5 lb. spiral cut, pressed the brown sugar all around it. Added a 6 oz. can of pineapple juice for some moisture. I couldn't cover the crockpot, so I put a small piece of foil over the top of the ham itself (to prevent the condensation from leaking out) and then sealed the crock pot with another larger piece of heavy duty foil. Cooked 3 1/2 hours on low and that was more than enough. Baste with juice after you remove foil, and baste again when you put it on the serving plate.

we use this recipe every Christmas. typically we have a 10 lb spiral sliced ham and cook it on low about 4 hours in our 7 quart Crock Pot. It turns out DELICIOUS every year. We use a slow cooker mashed potato recipe to go along with it, my family brings a couple other sides and we have an amazing dinner each year. Thank you for posting this original recipe!

I had seen this recipe before.  The ham tastes GREAT and is as simple as stated.  (I just got a fully-cooked ham.....tempted to try something like this with it, but I should probably leave it as is and only use uncooked).  Seriously, REALLY .  Many ham cooking instructions say to cover with water anyway, so it is perfect for the slow cooker. Cheers, K

I made a change to this dish, in the bottom of the electric pressure cooker/slow cooker besides de brown sugar, I added slices pineapples filling the spaces with the crushed pineapples.
Cloves were stuck around the ham, and for the finishing touch.
Surround the ham with more pineapple slices being held by tooth picks, filling once again with crushed pineapples.
This was as the saying goes, finger liking good, if you let it seat for a couple of hours to be bodyup.
The flavors of the mix is great.

I made this tonight with a bone in- shank end smoked spiral cut ham. I did reduced the sugar amount in half, added ground cloves and nutmeg plus 2 cups of apple cider and cooked for 4 hours. Came out great and will do it again. I loved the fact that it freed up the oven for other dishes.

The recipe was way too sweet for me (it's just a personal preference.) I tried it again in the crockpot using a spiral sliced ham, and pouring 1 can of cola on the ham, instead of the brown sugar and cooking it on low for about 5 hours. The sweetness was perfect for me, and I do believe it would be better for diabetics also. Also, to cut the sweetness, you can add mustard, which, when used with brown sugar is quite good. This basic recipe has hundreds of variations depending on personal tastes. You can add cranberry sauce and mustard for a really delicious taste.

Good ham. I couldn't find the picnic ham and had difficulty fitting the one I bought in the crock pot. Will definitely try again with a picnic ham.

Used this for Easter 2012 when our oven wasn't working...All in all it was a success.  There was a lot of flavor provided by the sugar and the cloves I studded in the 6-lb bone-in ham I used.  Cooked for 6 hours on LOW.

I'm on the fence on this one.  I used my normal smoked ham butt and ended up with ham pot roast.  It was very juicy and ended up with incredible dark brown ham stock for yummy ham gravy.  I will play around with the timing and type of ham.  I'm guessing that I didn't need the entire 8 hours this time around but had no choice since I had morning church service and work afterwards.  Like I said, I will play around with this in the future and update.  I am giving a high 4 star review since this is a convenient cooking method and the ham was nice and juicy.

This was juicy and tender, and very easy! I used a 7-lb. pork shoulder and poured a little bit of pineapple juice over the meat before rubbing it with brown sugar. Served sliced was good, but the meat was just perfect for shredding and coating with Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce!

It turned out very well. The ham was very tender. I put cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice on it and cooked an eight pound ham on high for 6 hours.

Great simple recipe. We are in Mexico where uncooked picnic ham is dificult to find, so we used a "pork leg" type cut, which shredded nicely. We firs rubbed it all up and coated it with honey mustard, then dry rubbed it with the brown sugar, and placed some pineapple rings on it. After about 4 hours on high It was falling apart, fragrant, sweet and salty pork heaven! Mixed up the leftovers with barbeque sauce, sauteed onions and a splash of balsamic vin. for some wicked good pulled pork sandwiches. Happy Eating!

I used a 10lb pre cooked butt ham, prepared it as instructed. Expected it to take 8hours but was ready in 6 and it was great! The meat fell off the bone. Like another reviewer said this method is not for pretty slices of ham its more of the pulled pork kind.

Ham turned out PERFECT.  My lid did not fit on my crock pot because my ham stuck up too far so I covered it tightly with foil and then set the led on top and it cooked perfectly!  This is my new method for cooking my ham!

I used the recipe on Christmas Day and our ham was delicious.  Thank you so much for an easy and foolproof way of making a ham.  It was nice to have the oven free for other foods.   My ham was just a little over 8 pounds and was ready to serve in about 6 hours.  My slow cooker seems to cook a little hotter than some others so I generally have to make adjustments for that.

Can't find a easier recipe than this one!  Definately use the pineapple juice and slices on top of the ham.  I really wanted to try the cloves too but had none in stock.  My Grandma always used to bake her hams using Vernors Ginger Ale so I might try that version next time I tweek this recipe.  Like everyone says, I'll never use the oven again for a ham.  This recipe is delish!

What an easy way to make ham! Per other reviews I covered my crockpot with aluminum foil because it was not big enough. After the ham cooked I tasted it and it was not sweet enough. I cut the ham into pieces and and put it back in the crock pot with the juices from the ham and let it simmer for a while. It then turned out delish!

This was fantastic! I poured a little pineapple juice in with it, like a few other people had suggested, and everyone LOVED it!  I will be making my ham this way from now on for all the holidays!  It will free up my oven for other sides!  Thanks for a great (and easy) recipe!

Wonderful! I used Montana's RedNeck ham which has only has 470mg of sodium for a 6lb ham, 500mg LESS sodium then the traditional Hams. Super easy and ohh soo good!!

Wow. I was so skeptical when I decided to do our Easter ham this way - but I don't think I'll ever cook a ham in the oven again. So tender and moist - I could not believe it. You do not have to add any liquid to this - my pot was full of a yummy brown sugar/ham glaze when this was done cooking.

Cooked this in my crock pot on low, left the ham in for 1/2 the time and the ham was burnt to a crisp when I checked on it. I know it wasn't the size of the ham because I was cooking a 10lbs ham.

I bought a 9+ lb ham and cut in to fit in my big slow cooker with the lid on for Christmas dinner. I think this is what kept it moist and delicious. My finicky family LOVED this recipe and I will be using it again.

This couldn't have been easier, or tasted better!  I made this for a family gathering and needed something easy so I could spend more time with my grandkids and not in the kitchen.  This certainly fit the bill and everyone loved it and thought I had put a very complicated recipe together!  Will certainly make it again and again!

The flavor was delish but I used pre-sliced small ham without a bone. I think I overcooked it because it came out a little dry. Fortunately, there was so much juice, I just poured a little over the top before serving.

Followed recipe exactly except the 8 lb ham didn't fit in my crockpot.  Cut all the meat off the bone and followed the directions.  Came out juicy and good.  Very easy and very good!

Very good.  I have a very hard time finding the right kind and size of ham so each time I make it, it turns out a little different but overall, it gets 2 thumbs up from my family.

This is a great recipe for ham.. I really have only had ham that my grandmother used to cook, but we liked this.  It's quick and easy, and I did not feel like spending alot of time in the kitchen.  I used a 3.75 lb ham, and cooked it about 3.5 hours on low, and it fell off the bone.  Served with baked beans and mashers... Oh, and I put a piece of foil over the top of the crock then put the lid on.

I've always baked my bone-in ham and it has never occurred to me to slow cook it until I tried this recipe. I seldom use my slow cooker. Never again will I bake a ham. I took a couple of peoples advice and added pineapple juice along with the brown sugar and without doubt, it was the juiciest, most tender ham we've ever had. My family raved about it all through the meal. I didn't cook it as long as recommended (about 5 1/2 hours) and it turned out perfectly. Thank you LITTLEMSTXTHANG.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It makes a very moist ham and is very easy.  The only drawback is that while I enjoy the sweet flavor, some of my kids thought it was too sweet and I can't use the leftovers to make other recipes like potpie.  However, it is very delicious.

We loved this simple ham. The picnic serving was the perfect size for a small family on Easter. The meat fell apart. Yummy.

My ham turned out dry, dry, dry.  I used a 6lb, bone-in, uncooked ham.  It cooked in less than 5 hours on low.  Next time I will cook it in the oven.  If you plan to try this recipe my advice would be to check your ham often.  I was very disappointed.

Super easy! I mixed the prepackaged brown sugar mix with water and put it on the bottom of the pot then added the ham.I cooked my ham for 2 hours on high then 1 hour on low. I basted a few times and rolled it over to keep it moist. It tasted fabulous and smelled wonderful while cooking!

I used a spiral ham. It came out moist and very tasty. I did sprinkle a litte ground cloves on the ham before putting the brown sugar on it. It freed up the oven for all the items that needed to be baked. I will be using this recipe again for my hams.

I used this recipe, but was afraid to have just the sugar in the bottom.  I added 1/2 a can of pepsi and it was great.  The best ham I have ever made. It was tender and juicy. I will use this recipe again! Thanks!

Nothing could be easier.  I am not a big fan of ham and I even loved it.  DH said it tastes like the spiral honey ham.  Served it with the "man lovin potatoes" from this site and we were both oohing and ahing over this lunch.  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this ham for T-day and Christmas dinner.  Fantastic.  It was too big for my 6qt slow cooker- so I double wrapped it with foil and it was great. The first time I overcooked it a little. The last time I kept an eye on it and it was perfect and moist. Easy to carve and great to look at. yum. Thanks.  I'll make ham more often now.

I used a spiral ham... I thought this was good and so easy, but not "the best".  BUT hey, for ease, you can't go wrong! Would definitely make it again as long as the ham wasn't the star dish.

A slow cooker ham is a great idea.  I made it on a Monday and used the left overs for meals all week.  I followed the other suggestions and my family loved it.

So simple, so awesome.  2 minutes preparation time means you can turn it on before you leave for work in the morning, and come home to the best smelling house.  It literally falls apart in your month.  I used less brown sugar and it was still incredible, we even had some for breakfast the following morning.

Maybe this would have been okay if I'd only cooked this 4 hrs, but after 8 hrs, this looked like beef, tasted slightly burned and was not enjoyable. I'll stick to the oven for baking ham.

This Ham came out so tender!! I used a 6.5 lb semi-boneless ham and I cooked it 8 hrs on low. I put brown sugar in the bottom of the crock and rubbed it all over the ham, then I used a can of pineapple slices. I lined the bottom with a few of them and placed the ham cut side down on them and secured the rest on the ham with a toothpick. I did have to trim a bit off the top of the ham. I basted it with the juices every 2 hrs quickly as to not let the heat out of the crock pot. I will never bake a ham in the oven again!! Thanks!

This ham was amazing!! I made it for Easter dinner and my family loved it. I used about 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of pineapple juice for a 8.5lb ham. I only needed to cook the ham for 5.5 hours on low and it came out perfect. Just watch the time, I think 8 hours would be much too long.

This has become our favorite ham.  It is so easy and good.  I used a boneless ham and I basted it as it cooked.  I cooked it for about 21/2 hours.  Soooo goood!!!

I made this for a family dinner.  Truly one of the easiest recipes around. Once I had some liquid in the bottom I did baste a few times to keep the top from being too dry though.

I made this twice and both times it came out great.  I did not use a picnic ham and am not sure what cut it was but I believe any cut of ham you use will come out great.

I honestly don't know what a picnic ham is, but I used a bone in smoked ham and it was the best ham I have ever had. I guess the dark brown didn't bother me as my step-mom's ham always had that anyways. Now mine tastes better than hers and it is easier to make!

We made this for Christmas 07 with a small cooked ham, I think it could have been in the crock pot longer than stated (I had a pretty small ham too) but once it was done, WOW! so yummy.

So easy and so delicious.  My ham was too big to put in the pot cut side down, so I just put it in sideways.  I also added a few slices of pineapple on top.  Such a fantastic way to make ham!  With my crockpot, I use the "High 6 hours" setting and really only leave it going 3-4 hours.  Works just fine.

Delicious!!  My husband who dislikes ham, and usually douses it with honey mustard to get it down LOVED this and didn't even want the honey mustard! My 4 & 1 year old loved this as well. Will be a regular in our house!

Absolutely wonderful!  This was the first time I ever cooked a ham, and the results were perfect.  I added a 1/4 cup natural applesauce and 1/2 tsp ground cloves (had no whole cloves for the ham) to the brown sugar which gave the glaze a nice flavor.  Next time I'll try whole cloves in the ham.  Definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic.  I'd never thought to cook a ham in a slow cooker.  I used a boneless ham.  (I have no idea what a picnic ham is.)  The only problem I had was getting the brown sugar to stick to the sides of the ham but none the less the taste was fantastic!

I placed a frozen Cooks ham in the crock pot(last minute thought) and it turned out quite well.  Only took around 6 hours on high to cook.  Hubby liked it.

YUM!  I've never seen 8 lbs of ham go so fast in my life.  Didn't have to worry about what ham casserole to make with the leftovers.  Too good all by itself, and amazingly simple!!

Why are there only 5 stars?  This recipe deserves more.  Never has my family raved so much about something so simple.  We just sat around the table picking at this until it was practically devoured.  I always thought of ham as a "holiday" meal but will not be willing to wait for a holiday to make this again.  I'm going to use the ham bone to make the Ham Bone Soup slow cooker recipe from this site tomorrow.

I thought this would be better.  I followed the recipe exactly.  7.5lb bone-in picnic shoulder and brown sugar.  It did not make as much juice as others reported so it cooked unevenly.   I wasn't home while it cooked to "doctor" it.  Others clearly loved it so I might try it again with a smaller boneless ham.

Thia was wonderful, full of flavor i did not have brown sugar so i used 1/2 C white sugar adn ?? amount of molases, along with the sauce that came with the ham, also added some rasins, put in slow cooker 2 hours on high adn the rest on low, once done put on warm, everyone raved about it we used spiral ham did not fit so cut it off the bone, would reccommend if doing that to watch as slow cookers can vary (just like ovens) definate will make again

The best I have ever had, thank you!!!!!  I even had my 12 yr old daughter throw the stuff in the crockpot, she was quite proud of her ham!!!  "We" used a regular butt end ham, and before I served the ham, I dipped it in the sauce at the bottom of the pot.

Thanx Littlems. I've never cooked a ham but I took a chance & decided to try this for my guests for this Christmas and it came out soooo good! Followed recipe exactly & couldn't be happier with the results. Used a 6lb. picnic ham, cooked for about 2 hrs. on high and 4 hrs. Fed 7 people and there is hardly anything left over. It just fell apart, no slicing involved. Absolutely delicious!

I made this recipe for my wife who hates baked ham.  Needless to say she loved it so much she had seconds.  It was so simple to make and was very juicy and tender.  This is one of my favorite recipes. Tastes just like Mom!!!

Fantastic!!!!  It makes sooo much juice...you can use it to make raisin sauce (gravy) instead of using water (and of course don't add additional brown sugar since its already in there!)

oh my gosh...this ham was delicious. My fiance and I were stuffed but just seemed to keep eating because it was so moist and delicious. I just put it in the crockpot in the morning and did errands all day, and when i came home the house smelled wonderful and the ham was perfect! I am looking forward to making it again and maybe adding some honey or cherries to try new flavors....and my dog was SO happy to have the bone afterwards!

Very easy and delicious meal for a busy day!  The meat was extremely tender, so tender I had a hard time cutting slices.  I look forward to making some homemade ham salad with the left overs and some red beans and rice with the bone! Thanks!!

This is so easy anybody who claims they can't cook can even make it.  Sometimes there is no pride in fussing about in a kitchen all day when results like this can be had with no work at all.  Sometimes less is definitely more.  This is a wonderful tasting ham - and the sauce can either be reduced to a glaze or flowered into a gravy.  Thanks very much for this recipe - this will be how I cook ham now for a very long time.

I have always wanted to cook a picnic ham because I love the flavor and texture and WOW!! If I could rate this more stars I would. Inexpensive and so much flavor. My husband took 1 bite & said WOW too. Loved the juice poured right over the slices of ham-can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow :-).

I give this recipe a 5 star rating for simplicity, but it doesn't take much more effort throw in a can (juice and all) of crushed pinapple and some ground cloves.  That's what I did and it rounded out the flavor.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I followed this recipe exactly as written and this was by far the easiest and BEST ham I have EVER made!  I will never again use my oven for a ham.  It got rave reviews from everyone at our Easter dinner, and my brother made it for his wife's Orthodox Easter yesterday with the same outstanding results.  If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would!  Thanks again for a great recipe.

First time fixing a ham in the crock. Fixed ham for Easter Dinner and everyone loved it. It was great to free up the oven for other dishes as well.  Will definately fix ham this way from now on.

I used a picnic ham, followed the instructions minus a bit of the sugar and it was absolutely perfect!  The whole family loved it and the leftovers were marvelous!  I will definitely make this again. By the way...we are not ham lovers, but this recipe may have changed that.

This was good!!!!!!!! And easy too! I didn't have 8 hrs because it was Christmas Day, so I cooked it for 6 hours and it was great! I will definatly do this again. I couldn't really taste the sweetness of the brown sugar and there was a lot of juice!

The ham was tender, juicy and delicious.  I did use a can of Dole Crushed Pineapple with the brown sugar in the bottom of the crockpot as well as using the brown sugar and pineapple juice poured over the ham to cook.

Delicious as written but I had to adjust the time. Only took 4 hours for my 10lb ham to be done. Any more and it would have been dried out! Also, consider adding pineapple juice for extra flavor. Yum!

This was delicious and easy. I was tasked with making the ham for our Christmas party at work. I was super worried that it wouldn't turn out very good as this was the first ham I'd ever made myself. 
My coworkers LOVED it!
The flavor was wonderful and they especially loved how it just fell apart like pulled pork. It is perfect for sandwiches and my boss ended up using a couple of rolls to make one. 
I just used a 7.5 pound smoked, bone-in ham and cooked it for the full 8 hours. It was very tender and juicy.
Definitely recommend this recipe as it is written!!

For a 9lb ham, 3.5 hours was too long. Maybe 2.5 hours would be perfect.
I added pineapple juice and honey to the brown sugar, studded the ham with cloves and draped with pineapple rings.  If I had added enough juice to cover the bulk of the ham and decreased the cooking time, this would be 100% entertainment worthy.

I made this and it turned out fantastic. I did add in a shot of Makers Mark which gave it a nice flavor from the bourbon.  This is my favorite way to cook a ham when I need the oven space.

Was excited to try this super easy recipe. I used a 7.5 pound ham on the bone. The recipe says 8 hours on low. I only let mine cook 5 hours on low and it was very dry. Disappointed. If I try it again I’ll only cook it 2-3 hours.

This was really good! I loved that it only took 2 ingriedients. Fix it and forget it. I think I would like to add some pineapple, and maybe some cloves next time. Also, The part of the ham that was above the juice was a little tough. I might try to flip it halfway through.

The slow cooker does absolute wonders with a ham like this! There were some chunks of ham that ended up with a different texture-- I suppose these pieces were covered with the brown sugar and were in just the right hot spots. Overall, a very good recipe though.

Followed recipe exactly. The result was a burnt looking  ham that fell apart when I tried to slice it. My family described it as "pulled ham". Would never try this recipe again and caution others  not to use it.

I use 2 ingredients as well but it's the ham and frozen pineapple juice. Don't dilute the juice. Put some of the frozen pineapple juice on bottom then put the remainder on top.  I like to continue cooking the juice until it is pretty dark (your preference). Cut and serve using juice like an jus.

The ONLY way I'll EVER cook a ham again.  Have made this a dozen times and each time, perfect.  I generalIy make a large ham so am not ablel to use the lid; no problem.  Just cover tightly with heavy duty aluminum foil and it works great. Do not remove foil just pop a thermometer through the foil for temperature.  Put the large flat carving part of the ham face down in the crock-pot. It also frees up your oven for other cooking.  Simple slam dunk recipe for a beautiful juicy ham dinner.

It's more difficult to find a ham that isn't spiral cut, but completely worth it. I made it exactly as written. It was tender and juicy!

Wonderful!  I started with the 1 1/2 c. of brown sugar in the bottom, but because I like pineapple, I opened a can of sliced pineapple in juice (not syrup), and poured the juice from the can over the ham just before packing the ham with the brown sugar.  Then I stuck the rings on with toothpicks (note to self:  use non-colored toothpicks).  Not salty at all.  Falls off the bone!

I found that using the suggested cook time, the ham dried out & was nearly burned. I love the recipe otherwise as much for its' simplicity as anything. I made a glaze with Michigan tart cherry preserves, honey and brown sugar & that rejuvenated the ham quite a bit. I'll simply adjust the cook time in future.

Very quick and easy, just the way I like. Turned out moist and delicious.  Just added some cloves with the brown sugar. The house smelled really good. Served it for New Year’s Eve dinner and the only thing that was left on the platter was the bone. This will be the only way to cook ham for me.

Used an 8lb spiral cut boneless ham, added a can of pineapple chunks without the juice, and a little ground cloves on top, covered it with foil and after 4 hours it was perfect! Nice and juicy and not dried out at all... like the other comments if you use a spiral cut you definitely need to cut the cooking time way down!

Ham was so tender but cautious don't over cook, especially if you add the pineapple's and juice like I do. It takes the smoke right out of the ham if you do with the pineapple juice and cooking a few more hours because we were waiting for our guests to arrive. I guess many people believe Thanksgiving dinner isn't ready when they arrive, but if I say noon everything is done at 11:45.

This was really good.I only used about 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and like others I was worried about no liquid so added 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Next time I won't add the broth because it isn't needed. My new recipe for ham!

Was a great recipe for a holiday when there was variation in the menu for those who wanted something different, also made Baked Salmon w/ Herb Sauce. Ham turned out great, tender and good in time specified - added crushed pineapple to the recipe. Recommend this recipe!!

My hubby and I were skeptical, but we felt it was worth the try. We made it for Easter, and everyone couldn't believe it was made from a slow cooker, including myself. I'll be making this more often since it's so easy. We had an 8lb Farmer John bone in ham ($10 sale) on low for 6 hours. We did baste it with it's own juices every hour, but that's optional, we were paranoid and decided to go a little extra to make sure it was yummy.

Great recipe that I will made again. The cooking time is way off though.  I had a 8 pound skinless Hickory Smoked bone in Butt that I cooked on high for 1 hour and 3 on low to perfection. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was so easy and turned out great.  My husband is diabetic so I only used 3/4 c of brown sugar...(2/4 for the bottom and 1/4 for the rub)  I cooked 5lbs for 6hrs on low.

Super easy! I'm a vegetarian, but my family, especially kids, love ham. I'm so glad I found this and made it! Even my super picky nephew requested this as leftover meals. I took another's tip and added a small can of pineapple juice.

I had a thawed ham so it was well done. Might be why it was sooooooo delic!

Super easy and yummy...great way to heat ham thoroughly and free up the oven or other dishes! I will probably only do 7 hours on low as 8 hours was a little more then was needed.

I used at 7.8 lb spiral ham.  I liked it but next time, I won't use a spiral.  It fell apart real easy but the flavor was wonderful.

I decided to try making my Easter ham in the crock pot for the first time - after reading the previous review, I was concerned since I had already purchased a semi-boneless smoked ham.  The difference I made was putting in a few cups of water, adding the brown sugar and then the ham.  Also sprinkled some brown sugar on top of the ham.  It was AMAZING!!

I made a few changes. I used a 2 1/2 lb picnic ham, added 10 oz of Coca-Cola, used 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar, and 10 oz pineapple juice with sliced pineapples on top. After cooking the ham for 3 1/2 hours in the crock pot, we (my fiance and I) cooked the sauce on the stove top, added about 6 oz light beer and a small amount of salt to taste. We brought it to a boil then turned it down to a simmer for about 15 minutes. Simmer longer for thicker sauce but it came out delicious!

This was a hit at Easter dinner!  I had to use a 9 lb smoked spiral sliced ham, however, as I couldn't find the type the recipe called for.  Based on the other reviews, I estimated a 3 hr cook time, and it ended up perfect.  It was so nice having the oven available for everything else!

I used an uncured spiral cut bone in, so was afraid since it wasn't a picnic ham or cured, it may not turn out right. This was the best ham ever!! From now on, I will only make spiral hams in a slow cooker and so should you!! 8 hours on low was perfect timing.

This was the best ham I have ever made. I wrapped the ham up in aluminum foil and then placed it in the crock pot and cooked it for the 8 hours.  It was so juicy and tender.  If the ham won't fit in the crock pot, prepare the ham as usual, wrap it in aluminum foil,  place in a 350 degree oven for 3-5 hours depending on the size of the ham.  22 minutes per pound will calculate how long you need to cook it in the oven.

I've made this several times and it always turns out great.  This last time I cooked a nine-pound butt portion and it was a big hit.  Once the crock cooled, I placed the whole works in the frig overnight. The next day I skimmed off the fat that had solidified and just let the left over ham swim in the pan juices. It made some really delicious sandwiches with a little sweet-hot mustard and a touch of mayo.  Tasty!

I use this recipe when I make ham. My husband gets a free one every year for Christmas. Anyway, I have used this recipe with a spiral sliced ham. I just don't cook it as long in the slow cooker. It doesn't get much easier than this recipe. It is nice to use the slow cooker to free up the oven for all of the other stuff that is made to go with it. It is good. I don't like my ham covered in spices and my husband doesn't like the glaze packets that usually come with a spiral ham. The brown sugar makes a nice sauce as it blends together with the juices from the ham.

This ham is very good   and I will make it again!  I used a large,one inch thick ham steak. I cut it to fit my slow cooker.  I added about 1/8 to 1/4 cup of water at the beginning of cooking.  I cooked it for 6 hours. It came out juicy and sweet.

This turned out as well as the "store bought" hams.  I used a boneless ham, placed in the crockpot and on 250 degrees F; let is simmer for about 6 hours.  
I did not have any cloves; however I mixed 2 teaspoons of Pumpkin Pie Spice in the brown sugar and followed the directions.  Nice easy way to make a ham.

I will definitely make this again.  No more dried out ham for me.  So easy and the best part is that I had my oven free for other dishes.  I did add a slight sprinkling (potent so make sure its only a slight sprinkling)  of ground cloves on top of the brown sugar but it would have been just fine without the addition of cloves.  My guest took it all home with them and then requested the recipe.

Could only find an almost 10lb bone-in ham..but cut it down a little and the top was sticking out of the crock pot..so I wrapped foil around it, then topped the lid over it. This had to be the most delicious ham I've ever cooked! Hubby put the 1 1/2c brown sugar on bottom of pot...then drizzled very small amount of honey over all the ham then rubbed remaining brown sugar all over ham.
We started checking it at 4 hours because I was sure there was no way it would go to 8 hours...we unplugged it at 5hours 15 mins and it was done.  Delish.

The juice that pools on the bottom is fantastic, and the ham itself is extremely simple yet amazingly tasty with this recipe.

Overall this dish was fine and its simplicity is fabulous when you need a no-fuss entree.  The texture was more like pulled pork than a sliced ham, and I loved it.  But because the only other ingredient was brown sugar, the flavor was lacking.  If I try it again I'll add more seasonings to make the flavor just a bit more complex.

Definitely moist and delicious, and so easy! However, even though the directions were clear, many of the reviews had various sizes/types of hams, and varying times for each. Mine was a boneless, 4 lb spiral cut uncured ham, and it took about 3.5 hours (& lots of checking) to get it right.

Very good but probably should have cut down my cooking time a bit. Probably 2.5 hrs on low would be enough for a 5 lb traditional ham
 Also, used only 1 can of pineapple juice as that was all I had on hand

I made this today with an 8.3 lb Spiral cut, cherry smoked ham in my 6qt crockpot. It BARELY fit, and I did cover it with tinfoil. It was AH-MAZING. I cooked it for 4 hours and I think that was perfect. I didn't get a burnt taste and the hardest part was getting it back out of the pot. It wasn't to my grandmother's or nephews taste as it was "too sweet" but the rest of us loved it. Saved for next year.

Recommended my wife simplify our first big Christmas dinner by using this recipe and glad I did.  She added a can of pineapple chunks and juice in addition to the brown sugar.  We used a Dearborn pre-cooked 8 lb. semi-boned ham.  It fit perfectly into our slow cooker and required no trimming.  Coated the bottom with brown sugar, put in ham, covered ham in brown sugar, and pour in the pineapple.  Set for 8 hours low,  and DONE.  Falling off the bone meat that everyone enjoyed.  We got a lot of rave reviews.  Simple and delicious. Why complicate things when this just works!

Slow-Cooker Ham was incredibly delicious!
Crock-pot, water and ham on low for 8 hrs and it was fork tender and not salty at all.   It was the easiest and best tasting ham I have ever cooked.     Nothing was wasted and bone fell right off into pot.    Added potatoes and green beans and corn for Ham Soup and also had a plateful of  Ham for sandwiches. 10 STARS for EXCELLENT recipe!!!

Despite my efforts to trim and cut the ham to fit my slow cooker, it just didn't happen so it was cooked at 200 in my oven in a roasting pan with lid.  After about 5 hours I pulled it out and it was beautifully glazed  and so moist.  Easy and very tasty.  Probably the easiest ham recipe ever!  Will definitely be making again with a smaller ham so I can use my slow cooker.

I've made this ham a number of times since it was in the magazine awhile back. The brown sugar elevates an average ham to excellent and an higher quality ham to wonderful! The only thing I do differently is to give it a few good twists of fresh ground pepper. Awesome!!

Followed the directions and the ham was amazingly tender and completely falling off of the bone.  I fixed it for my parents and they were completely blown away at how tender and delicious it was.

It was the  best ham ever.  My family loved it.  It was so juicy.  I will be making it again for Christmas.  By the way, it was a glazed pork shoulder picnic ham.  Thanks so very much.

I reviewed the recipe again afterwards and did everything correctly. I don't know why I didn't get the same results as the 5 star reviews. I used a slightly smaller picnic ham, about 5 lbs and everything else was done exactly as stated. We stuck a thermometer in to be sure it was done. I read some negative reviews stating that it would only take 2-3 hours with a smaller ham so we continuously checked but it wasn't done in the center for about 5 hours and it was flavorless and dry. None of those issues with burnt brown sugar or anything, but simply turned out tough and dry. My husband thinks the mistake was in buying a picnic ham. Perhaps we will try again one day with a pork butt.

I used a 9 pound bone-in uncooked "butt."  It really turned out more like pulled pork than a ham in both texture and flavor.  It was very juicy and tender and fell off the bone easily, but it didn't look very good and the flavor was uneven.  I cooked it overnight for a potluck MOPS meeting and didn't baste it at all during the cooking.  It really didn't have any ham flavor, which is what I was expecting.   It's not bad, it just isn't what I was expecting at all.

Simple direct no fail recipe!!  Followed directions exactly even used crushed pineapple as suggested in directions.  Quick, easy,  no bother recipe.  Next time will make some adjustments (mustard) but it will still be nice moist ham.

This was the most deeply flavorful and moist  ham I've ever made. The light sweetness of the brown sugar penetrated deeply and evenly.  I used a butt portion ham. I didn't know how it'd be without liquid, so I did add about 1/4 cup of ginger ale.  This is my new favorite ham recipe.

Since discovering this recipe a few years back on this site, it is the only way I make a ham now. Also, I have turned many of my friends on to it too and now its the only way they do their ham also! What I like about this recipe, other than the pure ease of it, is the way the ham falls off the bone, so tender and juicy, and I can place it on a platter for a pretty presentation during holiday gatherings.

I received an email with this recipe just before Easter and forwarded it to my sister-in-law, who was hosting.  She used a bone-in butt and made it with no modifications.  We ALL agreed it was the best tasting ham ever, and even those who were not ham lovers enjoyed it!  This recipe is a keeper...so easy and freed up the oven space for all the sides!!

Made with a picnic ham and added NO additional liquid. This was a HUGE success at our Easter meal. I cooked on high for about 6 hours. Not burned at all. Falls apart (we didn't mind this) which made it easy to eat. Just make sure the crock pot lid fits snugly or use tinfoil.

I Agree with some of the others that 8 hours is much too long. I had a 7 lb spiral sliced ham and 3 hours was plenty since the ham is already cooked.  I also Highly Recommend taking the sugar & honey liquid from the slow cooker and reducing it to make a wonderfully delicious sauce. Enjoy!

The ham was excellent, slightly sweet and salty. I also added a small single serving can of pineapple juice to the brown sugar on the bottom. The shank ham I used was very fatty, but when we removed the fatty layer, the ham underneath was juicy and tender. I used a 10lb shank portion ham in a 7qt crock pot covered the top with foil, making a slight depression along the edge so the condensation did not run all over. I cooked it 5 hrs on low (I have a very hot crock pot)and left it on warm for the last hour. How easy is that?

Not a favorite.  Cooked 7lb boneless smoked ham for 4 hours on low, pre sliced.  Flavor sat at the bottom of the pan and did not soak up the slices.  May be better with the picnic ham, a larger slow cooker, or a smaller ham.

I had an 8 lb. spiral cut ham and cooked it on low for less than the recommended time   - about 4 hours - and it was very dry and lacking any ham flavor at  all. I won't make it this way again.

Made it just as the recipe said and my family raved about it.  They all agreed this is the recipe they want me to use every time I cook ham.   Had leftover ham and eggs the next morning and that, too, was so good.  Quick, easy and delish!  Thank you so very much.

I had an 11lb, pre-cooked, bone-in smoked ham. I only added a can of pineapple chunks (after draining the juice). I used four layers of aluminum foil to keep the moisture in since the ham stuck up too far to cover with my slow cooker lid. I cooked it on low for about 3 hours. 

It was delicious, juicy, it didn't have to be perfectly timed, and I'll definitely make it this way again.

Wow! I was not expecting to be this impressed. Sliced like butter (I bought a 7lb fully cooked smoked ham), and was juicy and full of natural flavor. I followed directions and did not add any water and that ham was swimming when it was done. I covered the top tightly with foil. Cooked the full 8 hours. Do NOT buy a spiral ham or you will have MUSH meat. Served with greens, sweet potatoe casserole and cornbread. Had the next morning with buiscuits and scrambled eggs. Saved the ham bone for soup later on. Kids could not stop eating this. WIN :) Soooo EASY. Once I covered with foil I didn't bother it again. SN: I gave this friend this recipe- she added garlic and liquid smoke and raved about it.

I put this in exactly according to directions and on low. I left the house for about four hours, came back and it smelled great. Checked on it an hour later and it was burned and black. Completely inedible.

This recipe is awesome and so easy.  My ham never fits in the slow cooker so I always have to cover the top in foil. It always turns out moist and delicious and falls apart when finished making it easy to get all of the fat off.

Cooked this in the crock pot over night. I woke up to a wonderful smell. And then when I opened my crock pot I couldn't stop eating the ham! It's so delicious and moist and not too sweet. My hubby can't stop eating it either! Plus only needing 5 minutes to prepare it makes this a definite keeper.

Hands down, the best way to cook a ham, and so easy to "doctor" it any way you like.  I had a 9 1/2 lb. spiral cut ham from Costco that fit quite snugly into my 6 1/2 qt. Slo cooker and what I did was make a paste with the remaining sugar, 2 tbsp.s dijon mustard, 1 tsp. ground cloves, and a couple ounces of a rum and coffee liquer (used Kahlua's pumpkin spice).  Used half of the mixture to baste the top of the ham at the start, and the rest about 3 hrs. later.  Also poured 6 oz. can of crushed pineapple all around the ham as well as studded the top with whole cloves.  In 5 1/2 hrs. the ham was done perfectly.  It filled the kitchen with fabulous smells, and turned out moist, tender and delicious.  Fed 8 adults with plenty left over.  I will definitely be making this again and again and again!!

This was a great way to cook my ham for Easter dinner!! I used a shank end ham and followed the directions with the exception of reducing the brown sugar by 1/2 cup.  I also used a bit of orange juice but it was not necessary as there was lots of liquid after the 8 hours - next time I will just omit the juice.  The ham fell off the bone and was absolutely delicious!

I used an 11 pound ham and the inside of the ham was juicy and great, but the outside parts were all dried out. I would probably reduce the cooking time on this. I had it on low and I only had it on for 6 hours.

It was easy to cook the ham this way and it did free up the oven.  It did make the ham very moist BUT it also made my ham very difficult to cut in nice thin slices and everything had to be cut very thick in order for it to hold together. The meat practically fell off the bone which is ok.

We LOVED this recipe!  We made a much larger ham and cut it up to fit in our crock pot. We also added stock to it, BUT was not necessary and had to be drained off.  We received great kudos from family!  Another home run!!

This recipe produced a wonderful sauce for the ham.  I would like to caution that 8 hours in a slow cooker is too long and the ham will dry out.  Also, I found that I could not get a tight seal on my largest slow cooker with an eight pound ham and had to cut a large piece of the ham off in order for the lid to fit and make a tight seal.

Bleh.  I must have overcooked it some how or used the wrong cut of ham.  It turned out tough and did not look at all like a ham once it was done.

We loved this recipe! It was so easy, did not dry out the ham at all and left the oven available for other items. This will be our "go to" ham recipe for sure! PS: We did not use the cloves because we do not like that flavour.

I make this ham every year for Easter and Christmas at the request of my husband and his entire family. My family doesn't eat ham but if they did they'd LOVE this recipe too! It doesn't get any easier or tastier. I love that I can throw the ham in the crockpot and just let it do it's thing while I take care of all of the other things that a host needs to do for a large group of people and it comes out perfect.

Excellent!!  I made the for the high school kids at my school and they loved it!  It was very tender, fell off the bone and had a smokey taste to it.  I am not a ham eater and I even liked it. I am definatley going to make this for Christmas instead of the spiral ham.

Just to add one more voice to the cacophony...this is delicious and ridiculously easy. It does need less than half the cooking time called for, though.

Great, simple recipe!  My hubby & I are trying to get away from regular lunchmeat (salt & preservatives) so we cut it into four chunks and thaw it out as needed - Yummy.

This was perfection. Better than what you'd get in any restaurant, and we got lots of mileage on it from being a main course, to cut for sandwichs, and then we put leftover pieces on salad. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

SSOOO good!  I read the reviews and thought - good grief, way too easy!  I had bought a whole ham and had the deli slice it into 1/2 inch slices to freeze into portions.  I took a few of the slices out - still frozen - and put them in the crock pot with just the brown sugar (no liquids) and after several hours it was INCREDIBLE!  My neighbor stopped over during dinner and actually snitched a piece off of my son's plate!! :)

Thought the slow cooker stripped most of the flavor out of the ham.  No one in my family really enjoyed it much.

This recipe was fabulous and so easy to make.  I too was nervous about not adding fluid, so I added about 1/4 cup of water.  Within a few hours the slow cooker was full of liquid.  In the future I will not add any fluid.  The ham had a very nice not too sweet flavor.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Sue

I had a 5# smoked ham and a 4qt crock pot. So I cut it up and added the 2 cups of brown sugar. Nice flavor and so tender it falls apart. I intend to shred some of it and add some barbecue sauce to make ham barbecue sandwiches. Doing it in the crock pot was an excellent idea for summer!

Tastes good, but the taste of the meat reminds me of spam musubi, which is much cheaper and easier to make (fry spam with equal amounts of shoyu, sugar, and mirin).

This recipe is good for ham sandwiches but not for a nice dinner.  I would choose to put the ham in the oven next time for a nice sit down dinner.  The taste was sweet with a spiral honey baked ham bone in.

This is great recipe, its a great way to avoid heating up your kitchen in the summer. I used a 8lb bone in shank ham and since it was big I put allumium foil over my crockpot and let it cook for 8 hours. The fat separated really easy from the meat, I shredded it and added some bbq sauce. It was perfect and the family loved the leftovers.

I was looking to make something different for Easter and I found this recipe.  I was a little nervous at first, but after reading the reviews decided to try it with a few helpful hints.  Well, what can I say, it came out fantastic.  My husband, whose is probably the pickiest man alive, went back for seconds. The kids also couldn't get enough.  It was very juicy and well flavored.  I will be making this again in the near future.

Sometimes when you cook something yourself you are more critical.  I thought this was just ok but my family loved it.  I used a 5.5 lb. spiral cut picnic ham so it only took about 5 hours.  I'm impressed because it was practically effortless.

Just made this today. It was a big hit. My husband loves ham. When he tasted this one he said "you will have to keep making it like this". My mom is now going to cook our christmas hame in the slow cooker. Thanks again for the great recipes.

Ham is generally a special occasion food at our house so everyone was thrilled when I made this on a typical Tuesday.  It was super easy and very good.  I will definitely make this again for a special occasion because it frees up so much oven space!

either my ham was too big or my slow cooker is too small, I had to trim quite a bit to fit it in.  I also think 8 hours on low is too long.  By the time I discovered this, the ham was overcooked.  It didn't taste bad, it just looked too done.  I think I'll go back to my oven and vinegar method.  thanks anyway

This was amazing.  It will be my stand-by for all holidays where I need extra food.  I made it for Thanksgiving b/c we had unexpected company.  There was a ton of turkey left over, but no ham.  Everyone loved the juice poured over the meat.
