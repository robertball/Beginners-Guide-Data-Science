It was okay.  I had it raw.  very crumbly, not a lot of flavor.  But it was super easy to make, especially in one serving.

Butter first, baby. By the time you knead the butter into this recipe, the gluten is released in the flour. My kids made this without me, or I'd have been able to clarify this before they started.  We threw it away.

it was a huge hit! I made them into bon bons for an event and sold every single one.  will definitely use this recipe again. The only flaw I had was I used normal size chocolate chips and it was difficult to roll them into bite-size balls. So I will definitely use the mini chips next time.

We had to throw the whole thing out. We even baked some of it into cookies hoping it would improve... but sadly no. On a positive note... great experience for my son and daughter! Not every recipe will be a hit.

Made this for a sleepover and they're ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Definitely don't skip the chill part, it makes them soooooooo much better. Even my friends who don't like cookies love these!

I reduced the recipe to try so I could figure out which recipe to turn into cookie dough truffles later. It is a good basic dough but I would prefer more brown sugar.
