A nice and easy way to make a light homemade cheese. The recipe states 5-7 minutes, but it took me almost 20 to get to the curdling stage. Also, low heat (setting 3 on an induction stove-top) never even warmed so, after 7 minutes, I put it on medium (setting 5). The amount of whey leftover is a super bonus! Thank you for the recipe.
