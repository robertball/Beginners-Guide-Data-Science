Loved it!  The puree is a great way to hide veggies from the kids..... I added bell pepper and garlic to the puree and used V8 instead of ketchup.   Thank you for the recipe!

I have made all kinds of different meatloaves, from thankgiving style turkey to plain and simple. I think this may be my new fav. I halved the recipe, using organic grass-fed beef, organic bread crumbs, I still used 2 carrots, halved all other ingredients kept everything else the same.It's def. a keeper!

This is our favorite meatloaf!!  Loved the pureed vegetables.  It has great flavor and is sooooo moist!  I wouldn't change anything.

Frankly, I missed the soft crumbly meat and texture of onions, bell peppers and celery.  This was just okay for me.  The texture is firm.  With 2 pounds of meat and 2 cups of matzo that expands it makes a very large meatloaf.  It is sort of like a French country pate.  It did make great sandwiches spiced up with condements.  Would be great as a sandwich buffet item.

Had friends over for a comfort food dinner on a cold Oct evening....this was a great hit.  One guest said, "this is the best meatloaf I've ever had" the others agreed.  I must say it was the best I ever made. My husband was looking for leftovers for breakfast the next morning.

I think this is the best meatloaf I've ever made. It's definitely a keeper. So flavorful. The pur√©ed vegetables is a good idea for picky kids like mine. They will never know it's in it. Thank you for sharing.
