I basically followed the recipe and it was pretty good, just a tad too sweet. I also threw in a clove of garlic with the onion, some red pepper flakes, and a splash of worsheshire sauce

My only addition to this recipe was Durkee french fried onion rings as a topper!  My kids don't like onion bits in their food so we us this in it's place for all sloppy joe recipes.

My wife is always ribbing my about my cooking, not after this dish.  She is very finicky about her food but she wanted seconds and was disappointed that the kids had finished it off.  I highly recommend it.  I made it just as the recipe shows and topped with some shredded cheddar cheese and microwaved for 30 sec.

I came across this when I was looking for a quick & easy recipe since I was out of the canned stuff. Oh my, it is absolutely delicious, easy to make and my family loved it. I will never buy the canned stuff again. Thank you for sharing :)

A perfect simple recipe!I made it exactly as described and added green peppers. I will stick to this combination from now on. You can take the base which is fantastic and add any fix ins you need. Also if you don't add peppers, try a splash of bbq sauce for a kick.

We really liked this sloppy joe recipe. I did add a clove of garlic and a dash or Worcestershire Sauce, as suggested by others, and it was great! Simple and fast, too!

My anti-Sloppy Joe daughter ate half her sandwich and said this was better than what I usually fix (with a store-bought powdered mix).  My husband had three sandwiches and finished my daughter's other half.  He said they were the best he's ever had!  ~~When browning the meat & onions I added some garlic powder and ground in some black pepper.  Continued according to the recipe.  Tasted and decided it needed something more.  I added Worcestershire sauce and ground mustard (not prepared).  Tasted & added a little more.  This will likely be our go-to Sloppy Joes recipe!

This isnt complicated but its good. I made taco salads and had soem unseasoned ground beef leftover so I made it into these to have something on hand for my family to eat. I did add a very small squeeze of rooster sauce and some garlic. Very easy simple and good and I always have this stuff on hand. Excellent.

Good as is, almost exactly what I was looking for - a simple, basic sloppy joes recipe.  But when I tasted it while cooking, I decided to add 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce.  Then it was perfect.  I made a half batch, so for those making a full batch, you may want to add 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce instead.

This was very good. Was wanting sloppy joes and didn't have any Manwich but I had everything in my pantry for this. My daughter doesn't like green peppers so is always making a face if I make sloppy joes. She's a very picky eater and gobbled this up. I wish I'd read the other ratings and added the french fried onions. Will do that next time!! Thanks for an easy and economic meal since this is all stuff I always have on hand!!

'More info than an actual review:  I only buy 15oz cans tomato sauce, & didn't want to use ketchup & brown sugar.  I used the larger can & 3T brownsugar & it was sweet enough.  I don't like the tang so much of vinegar so I didn't add it, but did add mustard & worcestershire.  Used half turkey, half beef.  'Didn't expect anyone to like it that much - except E - & he did.  :)

Love this recipe!!  It has replaced my other go-to sloppy joe recipe.  I made it exactly as written with the exception that I added a little more ketchup and brown sugar.  I also added a little onion powder, garlic salt and black pepper.  Yum!!

I have another sloppy Joe recipe and I was missing some of the key ingredients so I went to my favorite website and found this one. Simple and it was  good. I made a few changes. I added about a tsp. of fresh minced garlic (in the jar) and added about a teaspoon of lawry's season salt. I thought it was missing something and that seemed to help. My family thought it was good and that’s what matters the most.

Just made this for dinner last night and WHAT A HIT!!!!  My picky husband had 3 servings, which is very rare.  After it was cooked I caught myself tasting it over and over again.  I did substitute ground turkey for the beef, added some garlic/mushrooms and used splenda brown sugar substitute.  A+++++++

Wow!  This was delicious!!  I loved the flavor.  It was moist and I will probably make this again.  I loved it!!  I wanted seconds, but I couldn't because of my restricted diet and also because there wasn't any left.  Even my son ate all of what was on his plate!

Great base, with an ability to tweak as your mood goes. I liked the base recipe but was in the mood for something smoky so I added just a Tablespoon of bbq sauce. Turned out great. Next time I want to try the mustard and durkee onions.

I selected this recipe because I was short on ketchup.   They were very good and simple to prepare.  I do think it needs a splash of worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper.  thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  I had to make some changes based on what was in the cabinet...instead of onion, tomato sauce and ketchup, I used a jar of Harry & David pepper and onion relish that I needed to use and a can of tomato paste.  Gave a nice little kick to the sweetness.  I'll definitely make this again!

I made this for the first time ever and my husband and I loved it. It smelled great while cooking and even better once it was done. I topped it with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. I'll definitely be making it again.

Hubby REALLY liked these. I thought they were really good too. Sweet and tangy. Not at all like I expected, it wasn't bland at all. Not spicy, but is a great base for adding all the extras you like to personalize it. I added about 6 good shakes of Frank's Red Hot sauce and served this on toasted buns with dill pickle spears. I did cook mine for 50 minutes, covered the first 40. Thanks, this was good, we enjoyed these for lunch.

My husband and I liked this very much.  If you like Manwich, you'll probably like this as the flavors are similar.  I was nervous at first because I'm not a big ketchup eater and at first the "gravy" tasted all ketchup-y.  But I added a dash of garlic salt and after it simmered for a while, the flavors all blended and it was really good!

I read thru a few recipes and a some were ridiculous (add two cups of water and simmer for forty five min)? I didn't bother with the 8 oz of tomato sauce. For the onions I added some I caramelized earlier in the week. Hodie's is the way to go. ready to dig in and under twenty minutes.

This recipe was very easy with things on hand - but it just didn't have the right flavor  - the apple cider vinegar flavor was just too strong - even after simmering.

Turned out great! I made this for a potluck at work. All I added to the recipe was diced onions and green pepper and cooked it in a slow cooker. Needless to say, there was no leftovers.

This was good, however, I did make some changes based on other people's reviews.  I added fresh garlic and omitted the onion because my son will not eat anything with onions in it.  I added some onion powder, fresh ground pepper, a pinch of red pepper flakes and some Worcestershire sauce.  I topped the sandwiches off with French Fried Onions (for those in the family that like onions).  Turned out delicious this way.

Nice & easy recipe. We would have given it 5 stars but had to add a few things to it. That said, it's a nice base recipe that can be easily personalized to your own taste.

I made this exactly as written, as I always want to do that before altering a recipe. It was way too sweet for me. So, I doctored it up, and ended up with a pretty good tasting sloppy joe. Things I added were 1 TB prepared mustard, another TB of cider vinegar, 2 TB barbecue sauce, 1 TB salt and 1/2 TB pepper, 1 tsp. minced garlic, 1 whole green pepper, chopped. This cut the sweetness down quite a bit but I felt it still had a strong taste of brown sugar. If I make it again, I will probably keep all of my additions and leave out the brown sugar entirely because the ketchup adds quite a bit of sweetness on its own.  Or I may try leaving out the ketchup and still reducing the brown sugar to start with. I picked this recipe because it called for less ketchup than most and subbed tomato sauce for part of the sauce, and for that reason alone I will probably keep trying it with revisions.

Added some red pepper flakes, apple cider vinegar, garlic powder and worcestershire sauce  to experiment as in other recipes.  I also added chopped carrots and mushrooms because I wanted to use up extra veggies in the fridge.  Very good!  Easy.

This was awesome. Husband loved it too. Since I didn't have tomato sauce,  I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilis and added more ketchup. Also used red wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar and added garlic powder and worchestershire sauce.  Sweet and spicy - yum!

Much better than Manwich.  I added some fresh garlic, diced bell pepper, and some red pepper flakes.  I did cut back on the sugar by 30% due to the remarks about it being a bit sweet.  I will definitely be making these again.

My wife and I made this recipe for her work party. We reduced the brown sugar to 1 Tablespoon because we made a small batch the weekend before the party and thought it was a little  sweet for us. She received many compliments on the Joes at the party. We love it too. Kicks the butt of the canned brands. Easy and fun to make and ooooh soooo goood. Thank you for this recipe. Your Grandma had it goin' on.

Was delicious!  I doubled the sauce recipe including the brown sugar.  I would put less sugar in next time because it became too sweet and i had to add hot sauce and salt.  I also added some red bell peppers.  Overall, it was really good.

Changed the recipe to 40 servings. Only added a sparse amount of the brown sugar. And some people still thought it was a little to sweet.I loved it!

Way too sweet. I prefer my usual recipe but I was low on ketchup so tried this instead. I ended up adding a tsp of Worcestershire and a 2nd tbsp of vinegar to balance the sweetness. Also added little salt and a splash of barbecue sauce. Not bad with the changes but I think it would have been better with at least half of the brown sugar left out.

Simple, quick, easy, and really tasty!  This recipe is great as is, and definitely way better than the canned stuff.  As others have suggested, I like to dress it up a little with some chopped green peppers, a couple dashes of Worchestershire and Louisiana hot sauce.  "Fancy!" I know :)

I added garlic to the beef and onion mixture and a splash of worchestershire sauce while everything was simmering as I don't like really sweet sloppy Joes. The worchestershire sauce helped cut the sweetness and added a nice flavour.

Just okay... but to be fair used grnd turkey and  I didn't have catsup.  Since it was a bit bland... I Added chopped garlic and a teeny tiny bit of  BBQ sauce and hot sauce .  i prefer to make this with condensed tomato soup.

This was a very good recipe. I've tried several Sloppy Joes recipes, and there's not very much variation in them, I find. I made this almost exactly as written, using light brown sugar, and a little more ketchup than specified (I measured out too much and couldn't exactly put the excess back into the bottle). It was quick and easy, and was decently thick. Perhaps a tiny bit too sweet, in my opinion. But it was all quite tasty, and the serving count is dead-on - it fit onto 6 (smallish) hamburger buns. I can recommend this recipe.

This was very good.  I used a sprinkle of green stevia in place of the brown suger and dry mustard instead of prepared.  We added salt and pepper to taste, as well as some italian seasoning to the meat and onions.  This recipe is great for an easy meal.  Thanks!

Yummy!  Quickly comes together and would be an easy weeknight supper.  Even my three year old gobbled it up.  Thanks for a new addition to my regular meals.  We used ground turkey and it's very tasty.

This recipe is great!  I used a 93/7 lean ground beef and light brown sugar.  Best sloppy joe's I've had by far.  I'll be making these again.

Very good.  Missing something according to our taste.  We added 1/3 tsp of groud chili peppers, and that seemed to "spice" it up a bit.

Easy to make with ingredients I had available.  Pretty good taste but not the best.
