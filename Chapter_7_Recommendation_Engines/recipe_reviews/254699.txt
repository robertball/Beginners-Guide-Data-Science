Good recipe! I added ground sausage and petite green beans (cut in half), and used Italian seasoning. A "snugly" soup for a chilly day.

Took about 50 minutes to make. Used two potatoes instead of one. Used one packet of ramen instead of two. Omitted the tomatoes and rosemary. Add two TBSP Better Than veggie Bouillon for great flavor. Paired with a Chinese Cabbage Salad, family loved!

I made this for lunch.  I did all the chopping prior to turning on the burner.  I think 20 minutes prep time is a bit wrong.  I agree with another reviewer who said 50 minutes is more realistic.  I made this with one alteration. I did not put in all the ramen noodles as I was only serving two people and wanted to save some for another day.  Next time I would not dirty my blender pureeing 1/2 cup of beans.  I thought this had good flavor but could be more "Italian" with maybe some red pepper flakes or other seasonings.  I would make this again.  Two packages of ramen noodles is way too much.

I didn't know what to expect from the bean/ramen/potato combo, but this was yummy! Changes: My husband doesn't really like rosemary so I only added 1 tsp. of dried rosemary, and also added a dash of garlic salt, which tasted great. I also cut both the amount of onion and ramen in half. We'd definitely make this again, but next time skip the parmesan cheese on top (it didn't mix in very well and mostly just stuck to our spoons).

Great recipe! I had some leftover shredded pork in the fridge that I added which added a nice flavor. I didn't have rosemary so I subbed Italian Seasoning. I left the soup to sit on the stove with the burner off, and within 30 minutes the broth most mostly absorbed by the noodles. For leftovers, I will add additional broth.

Good soup. I used homemade chicken broth instead of water, and smashed up some of the beans with a spoon to avoid washing my food processor. I didn't care for the rosemary, and would probably use a different spice next time. But certainly a good base, and I will try this again. Most of the ingredients I would usually have on hand. You can't have too many soup recipes!

I love simple serving my family vegan vegetable and bean soups, so this was perfect! I did a few things differently. I didn't puree the beans at all, but I added them to the soup without draining them for creaminess. I also used diced Italian tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano. To keep the soup thinner, I also added an extra cup of water (5 total, not 4) which kept it a better consistency after the noodles absorbed some liquid. This is delicious and everyone loved it!

I loved it! Easy to make. If you are making it just for one, you might want to cut recipe in half.

IT WAS EASY & ECONOMICAL BUT NOT A KEEPER...
THE ONLY THING "ITALIAN" WAS THE CANNELLINI BEANS AND A FEW HERBS!

TIME FRAME: "READY IN 50 MINUTES IS MISLEADING!..  IT TAKES ABOUT 50 MINUTES TO CUT,CHOP, SLICE , MEASURE, AND PREP THE INGREDIENTS PRIOR TO TURNING ON THE BURNER!!
