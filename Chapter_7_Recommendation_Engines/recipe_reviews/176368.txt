I was looking for a recipe that had similar dressing to the roasted red pepper they serve at the salad chain, Mad Greens. This recipe is delicious, however, I added 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, and too sweeten it a little, 1.5 tsp truvia (stevia sweetener). It was a dead ringer for the original. Delish, and I making my second batch now!

The recipe was good. It was a bit too sour for my taste, so I would probably add another 1 or 2 peppers to get more of the pepper flavor. Additionally, I had to figure out on my own what temperature and for how long to roast the peppers in the oven. I went for about 400 at about 30-45 minutes. Overall, I think I'll keep this recipe in my arsenal. Thanks!

I think the recipe is great. I always use it with my salad. But, I use a little bit more red wine vinegar (like 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup) and add some sugar (like 1Ts) to balance the acid. I will also put some minced garlic and oregano to make the taste stronger.  Sarah, thank you for your recipe! Me and my family like it!

Super easy to make, with a nice fresh flavor. I would suggest adding a little of your favorite seasonings to accentuate the flavor.
