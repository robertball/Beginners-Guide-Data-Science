This was a great breakfast! I like the mix of spicy and mild sausage and the addition of minced onion.  This added some nice flavor to traditional sausage gravy.  Will make this again!

A very good basic recipe! I used Maple Venison Sausage only...  The onions and salt and pepper was enough. I prefer Corn Starch to thicken my gravy..  otherwise you can't go wrong using this recipe! Just be sure to adjust the amount of milk and flour or Corn Starch to how much sausage you use. Thanks Ann!

Made biscuits and gravy for the first time. This recipe is awesome. I probably should have added a little more milk. Having never made it before, I wasn't sure how much it would thicken while simmering. Next time I'll know. My husband loved it!  Thank you for such a fabulous recipe. It's a keeper.

Family doesn't care for onions in gravy. Used Carnation can milk plus a can of water.

I added some Italian spice blend, other than that followed the recipe as written.It was really good and filling. Next time i'm going to take a smaller portion, as I couldn't finish, and hubby had to clean up my plate!

The Best gravy I have ever had! I use all regular sasuage because we prefer it to hot but even that way the flavor is incredible! Huge hit with my entire family. I've made this over and over again
