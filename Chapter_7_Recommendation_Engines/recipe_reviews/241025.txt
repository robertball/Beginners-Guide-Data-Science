Followed this recipe to the letter and wouldn't change a thing.  Don't be afraid of that little bit of cayenne, it really won't smack you in the face.  It gives you a hint of spiciness without overwhelming, and it's an important ingredient to what makes this cookie special.  I rolled the cookie dough balls in Turbinado sugar, and the cookies'  texture was just about perfect.  The only thing that I did differently was to bake for 11 minutes instead of 9.  Thanks, Anisa, for sharing your unique and delicious cookie recipe.

Omg these were delicious!! I did drizzle melted rolos on the tops and I didn't have cayenne. I thought I did but didn't realize until it was too late. I will make these again and again. A dozen was gone in minutes.  Three kids adored them.

Quick 1 Bowl cookie with great flavor. We made a 1/2 recipe and baked it in a counter top oven. I did switch up the shortening and the butter since I only had regular shortening and had to add a 1/4 more flour because dough was way too soft. Next time I may do all butter and chill the dough for 30 minutes. 9 minute baking time was exactly perfect in my oven.

I rolled these little babies in raw sugar before baking them for 9 minutes. They are soft in the center and crisp on the outside because of the sugar - just right! The cayenne is such a nice addition to these delicious gingerbread cookies! Try them!

These are wonderful cookies - if you want to keep them at all soft / chewy definitely don't overbake though! I cut the cayenne pepper in half, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I made the cookies just a little smaller then called for as well, so ended up with a few more then the recipe said it would make (which is unusual, usually I make my cookies large and end up with way less then the recipe said it would make)! They are delicious - great mix of spices in this one - they are warm, soft, crunchy, chewy, spicy and delicious with a big glass of milk to wash them down!

I made some changes - made it vegan, and a little bit more crumbly.

This is an excellent recipe. I followed it except that in addition to the ground ginger I added two tablespoons of finely chopped fresh ginger. 

I used a two tablespoon scoop and baked for 14 minutes. Came out crusty on the edges and soft in the middle which I think is the best. Part of the reason for the extra cooking time is that I use full size insulated cookie sheets that seem to add about three minutes to cooking times found here.

I used a melon scooper to make perfect, uniform cookies. They were absolutely delicious.
