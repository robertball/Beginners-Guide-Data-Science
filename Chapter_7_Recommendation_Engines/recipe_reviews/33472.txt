I never liked deviled eggs before this recipe - they are great - quick tip - put the yolk mixture in a ziplock bag - squeese the air out - seal and cut a corner off & use as a pastry bag - the eggs will look great!!

After reading the reviews I cut the salt by 1/2. The second time I made them (if this gives you a clue as how much I enjoyed them) I added 1/2 of the ground cayenne pepper into the yoke mixture and then sprinkled the other half over the top of the finished product. That raised my personal rating from 4 to 5 stars as each egg was more consistant in "heat."

Due to a previous review saying they were too salty, I reduced the salt by half.  Still salty!!
You might want to add a tad more mayonnaise also.
Otherwise were good.

These had just the right kick for the guys' Monday night football entourage.  I did however add about a tablespoon of white vinegar to the yolks, and used white pepper vs. the black.  Good eggs, I would use again (even my 12 yr. old liked them.)

These were TERRIBLE! My husband is not a picky eater at all and he loves deviled eggs, but he only took one bite. We both thought these were just awful. Way too salty!

i did exactly what the recipe calls for, but it was way to salty. i couldnt even eat them they were so salty.  people might want to lower the amount of salt before wasting their eggs/yolks on this.

These are really good! I brought them to a family picnic and doubled the recipe, and they were all gone- I was gentle with the cayenne and the salt.  I did to taste.

WAY WAY WAYYYY too salty!! I would reduce the salt by half or more if you make this. Also I dont really see how just adding cayenne made them Cajun.

This is the best deviled egg recipes EVER. I get rave reviews every time I've made it. NOTE: Salt level should probably be cut in half. Taste the mixture before you load it into the egg whites.

I enjoyed these - definitely added much more cayenne pepper into mixture and on top to make it spicier, as well as some other cajun seasonings.

I took everyone's advice on reducing the salt.  I cut it down to 1/4tsp (and had almost twice the eggs - 10) and it was still grossly oversalted.  Had to cut up the whites, mix and serve as egg salad sandwiches so the bread would absorb the salt.

This was a great deviled egg recipe.  I was looking for a way to spice up the old standby and this was perfect.  I don't like adding salt to almost all of my recipes, so I didn't and it was perfect.

Cut the salt and these are fantastic.  I added the cayenne pepper into the yolk mixture rather than sprinkle it on top.  Everyone loved them.  For the few people who wanted them hotter, I sprinkled more cayenne on top.

The cayenne on top lookes pretty and some may think it's paprika but gives a little kick; I did go light on the cayenne as children will be eating them.  I added a little bit of dill in my egg yolk mixture too; I agree that their a little too salty so I'd cut back next time. Thanks

I thought it was perfect.  I didn't measure the spices, eye balled them but I know I didn't add as much salt as it called for.  I also added cajun seasoning as well.  Delicious with a kick!  Thanks for sharing!

First batch I followed the recipe exactly and it was WAY too salty!! Second batch, I cut the salt in half and I still thought it was too salty. Next time, if I try this recipe again, I will cut out the salt completely.

Really liked this, but I only used 1/4th the amount of salt that is recommended. This is definitely too rich to eat on a daily basis (darn!)

This were very tasty. They were basically the traditional egg with a little bit of heat. I added just a pinch of salt as opposed to the amount listed, used half the cayenne in the mixture, added a few drops of Franks hot sauce and sprinkled with the remaining cayenne on top. Tasty but not extraordinary.

The thing I learned to cook when I left home for college many (many) years ago was hardboiled eggs.  This may sound silly (FYI.. The "Julia Child Method" really does produce the best hb egg - google it, it's kinda lengthy!), but it also illustrates how much I love deviled eggs, LOL.  This recipe is pretty much my favorite cold egg recipe (yes, you can make them warm, Mmmm!!!).   I like to use a Jalapeno Dijon my sister sends me from Oregon and I also use freshly ground Garlic Pepper; let these chill in the fridge awhile before serving, this really intensifies the flavors.

I tweaked this a bit and it was awesome.  I don't like mustard so I left that out and I used Old Bay seasoning instead of cayenne pepper.  I brought these to a party and they were gone within minutes.

I love deviled eggs but these are just way too salty.  Luckily I tasted the filling before filling the whites.  I'll be making more eggs to cut the saltiness.

I was bored today so I made 4 different recipes for deviled eggs at the same time and had neighbors & friends do a taste test. This one came in 4th. The testers represented a large range of tastes, but no one rated it higher than third. It is too course will all the pepper and dijon, almost gritty, and the flavor is bland. The other recipes in my taste test were "Deviled Eggs" by Barbara, "Deviled Eggs II" by Mary Brotherton, and "Deviled Eggs" by Margaret Sanders. Margaret's were the unanimous winner.

This was good although very salty. I ended up just eating the egg whites after the saltiness became too much to take. I would make this again with no salt  and add more cayenne.

These were so yummy.  I made them for my daughter's birthday party and they all disappeared.  Instead of cayenne, I used some Tobasco and it gave them a nice little kick.  I was out of cayenne so I had to make the substitution....we liked it so well, I'll be sure to do it that way again.

This was a good recipe, however, I like my deviled eggs alittle creamy. So, I added 2 tsp of pickle juice to the recipe and topped off with Hot Shot. They were great and had a kick to them.

OMG!  They are trying to kill us with salt! Totally ruined 6 eggs and wasted my time. This recipe might be good with less salt, but I'm removing it from my recipe box and looking for a recipe that is good to begin with. I hate wasting time and food!

MMMMMMMM....I love deviled eggs AND cayenne pepper, so I knew that these guys were just right for me. I made them for our daughters' birthday party and everyone gobbled them up. I didn't see the need for salt, so I left that out. Wonderful Denyse and "Justin" would be proud!!!!

This was a great recipe! I made this recipe as a appetizer for a party. I'm so glad I boiled two dozen eggs, because everyone could not stop eating them.  I added Hormel real bacon bits as a garnish. WOW!

This is possibly my fourth or fifth time that I've made this recipe!  It was so easy to make. Since I like my food quite spicy, I added extra cayenne pepper and the cajun deviled eggs simply taste fantastic.

Great recipe, though I did cut down on the salt as recommended by others.  Not too spicy either.  I would probably add a little more cayenne next time to give it just a tad more zip as I like this spicy!

Not our favorite.  I think this recipe needs more mayonnaise, less salt, and add some garlic powder to better suit our taste.

This recipe is your very basic deviled eggs, with the addition of a bit of spice which isn't normally in them. So, while it tastes just fine, I can't give them my highest rating due to lack of creativity.

I followed other reviewers' advice and used just a pinch of salt instead of the full 1/2 tsp, and they turned out beautiful and delicious.

I only had 4 eggs on hand, not 6, so my proportions were estimated, so I don't know if the taste was exactly by recipe, but I thought these were great!  I skipped the salt, based on other reviewers, and I think that is a good move.  My boyfriend didn't believe me when I told him these were not regular deviled eggs until he tried them. They look very much the same with red pepper instead of paprika. However, this didn't seem to be a problem for him.

Very good even though I messed up on a few parts.  A tip for other newbies like me is to really make sure the eggs are cool or else when you peel them they will fall apart and the shells will be especially hard to take off efficiently.  I thought that the Dijon may have been too little but the taste was really evident, so it's enough!  Good recipe.

These eggs were very good, but I couldn't taste the cajun spices very much.  Maybe it was the brand I used?  Everyone loved them, but no one knew they were cajun.

I did not like these at all. They were too salty for my tastes and bitter. It could have brand of dijon mustard since I have only had dijon mustard once that I actually liked and the kind I bought was terrible. If I find the mustard I like I may give these another chance and leave out the salt.

This was my first time making deviled eggs and I thought they turned out good.  I tried the bag idea, but had an easier time just using a very small spoon to put the mix back in the egg.  Next time I will pick up disposable icing bag.

I was tired of making the same deviled eggs for every family gathering, so I decided to give these a try for a change of pace. Everyone loved these! I cut the salt in half and mixed the cayenne pepper into the egg mixture instead of sprinkling it on top.

I had never made deviled eggs before and everyone loved them.  This recipe was easy to follow

Made these with salad dressing to make them a little sweeter.  They were perfect!  Thanks.

Way to much salt!!  Read the reviews before making.  I’m not sure how this had 4 stars—it was inedible.

I did not put anywhere near the amount of salt the recipe called for, and I mixed the cayenne right in with the yolk mix. I used smoked paprika to sprinkle on top. It's delicious.

This recipe was SO easy to make and I includes stuff I already have in my pantry! Like many other reviewers, unless you are a salt fiend, you're going to want to half the salt on this recipe. I put some cayenne in the mix as well as the sprinkle at the end. I also put just a touch more dijon as well to give it that bite. Overall a great recipe and tasty!

I loved the flavor except the salt content... I cut it back to 1/4 tsp and it was still quite salty.  I would make it again but with 1/8 tsp of salt or less

very good, but we needed to add additional mustard and mayonnaise to obtain a nice, creamy texture!

The eggs are great but I recommend NOT adding any salt! They were really salty. I will use the same recipe again and not use the salt and see if it is better.
