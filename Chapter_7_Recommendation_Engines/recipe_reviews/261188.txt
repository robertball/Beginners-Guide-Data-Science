Life has been super hectic lately and this simple, nutritious meal was delicious and greatly appreciated.  I only have one complaint... at 35 minutes, the chicken is perfectly done but the veggies are not. Next time (and there will be a next time because this was really good), I’ll remove the chicken and let it begin resting on the cutting board and continue cooking the veggies for another 10 to 15 minutes.  I actually think this recipe should be written that way.  If properly cooked, this is definitely a 5 star dish.  I served this alongside a good old-fashioned baked potato with a red glass of wine which elevated this simple recipe to a meal worthy of any day of the week.

I didn't have a garlic rosemary citrus marinade so I made one. Marinading the chicken made it flavorful, tender and juicy. I really liked this meal and it was so easy to put together. Roasted vegetables are always welcome in our house. I baked a few potatoes along with it. A great meal for a busy day.

Yum! I couldn't find the Stonewall Kitchen marinade, but found something similar in flavors. It was very good! I took the chicken out at about 20 mins since they were done early and broiled the vegetables at 525 for about 5-6 mins until lightly brown.

This was excellent.  I did not, however, use any marinade on the chicken or vegetables.  I tossed the veggies in couple of tablespoons of olive oil added salt and pepper and dumped on the sheet pan. I used cut up whole chicken, tossed in olive oil added salt and pepper.  Then placed over the veggies on the sheet pan and roasted at 350 until chicken was done.  I used cut up turnip, also.

Great meal, and very versatile based on what veggies you have.  I made my own marinade with 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup lemon juice, 1 tsp orange peel, 3 tsp dried rosemary, and some garlic.  I baked it at 450 for 35 minutes and then broiled the veggies as directed.  Delicious!

The Stonewall marinade is out of this world.  I made my sheet pan with potatoes that had been parboiled and they came out perfectly.  This a delicious and colorful meal.  And so easy! The stonewall marinade is available on Amazon and is worth every penny.

I didn't change anything but used big carrots peeled and cut.  Thought this was easy and outstanding!  Was skeptical about the marinade being that I'm not a huge fan of rosemary, but it all came together beautifully and was excellent!  Made it last week and am making it again tonight.  Even the leftovers were delish!

Delicious, easy, nutritious one pan meal; open for all sorts of tweaks!  No need for marinade, really. I opted to "dry brine" the breasts for 4 hours, rinsing them well before proceeding.  I added more cubed veggies plus, smaller cut carrots and  quartered baby bellas .  Dump and mix it on parchment lined baking sheet tossed with garlic infused EVOO, salt and mixed herbs.  The chicken on top cooked in 30 minutes so it was removed.  Increased temp to 550 and cooked the veggies for 10 more minutes.  Perfection!

Loved it and followed recipe.  My only comment is that the Stonewall Kitchen marinade was a bit too sweet.  Will definitely make again, especially if I can find a less sweet marinade.  Partially microwaved parsnips and added to the tray.  Parsnips made a great addition.

I made it but instead of the chicken breast I used legs and thighs. The only problem was that the carrots and Brussels sprouts had to cook longer than suggested time so my chicken was a little dry

Easy to make and I love it! Added sweet potatoes instead of squash cause was thinking of using what I had in the pantry. Also used a plum sauce instead of citrus marinade. Cooked everything else as per the instructions and I had a 2nd helping

I loved that this dish had a lot of seasonal vegetables. It is also pretty simple if your have the marinade it calls for.I didn't, so I looked up the ingredients in that, online and tried to duplicate it. The issue I had was in the cooking time. After 25 minutes, the chicken was done but the  veggies were not ! I had to remove the chicken and return the  pan back for another 20 minutes. Also the upper layer of the Brussel sprouts was overbrowned and I had to flip them.  I served with some dinner rolls

I made this dish for a large group and it was so simple! I added  another apple, some kale, and some red onion. Baking chicken is always so much more juicy! It was a hit!

I didn't have the marinade so I improvised. I plan to make it again with the marinade. I used delicate squash, my favorite, and it was delicious as well as beautiful. Both healthy and filling with the variety of vegetables. I will make this again. I love one dish/pan meals.
