This recipe deserves a lot more love!  As a former junk food lover who now has to follow a gluten free/lactose free diet, these are heaven sent!  Just sweet enough to satisfy that craving, yet there are no added sugars, artificial sweeteners, dairy, or gluten.  It is swell baked up in a little loaf pan, too.  Try other sources of moisture instead of the banana, like pumpkin or peaches.  Add in dried cranberries, walnuts, pumpkin pie spice, or even chocolate chips.  I make this recipe several times a week now.  Thanks so much!

ADD peanut butter! This recipe can differ every time you make them. Adding a half cup of peanut butter, and 1/2 cup of chopped nuts, are great options. You can use any type of milk, and I love scrunching up a large size shredded wheat biscuit in place of some of the oatmeal, just before forming cookies. Makes them look more interesting! A fruity version, orange or pineapple juice instead of the almond milk, with dried blueberries, Craisins, whatever, plus coconut. My diabetic partner loves them! I make them small, so he can eat a few whenever he feels a little hungry. If you want to sweeten them up, maple syrup is a great option.

These are terrific as a grab-and-go breakfast on the run or for a roadtrip ... so much healthier than the usual high-calorie transfat-laden options. I started making them when I had some overripe bananas I didn't want to go to waste. Now I deliberately buy big bunches of bananas, hoping some of them get overripe before I've eaten them all. I have used crushed pineapple in place of the applesauce and it's just as tasty. I always add nuts (pecans, sunflower seeds, chopped walnuts, whatever I have). I make mine with either instant steelcut (Trader Joe's) oatmeal or rolled oats. I happen to like the nuttiness of the steelcut, but others prefer the rolled oats. You can add chocolate chips (try the mini-chips), dried cranberries, dates, apricots, etc. I cut my dried fruit into smaller pieces with a pair of kitchen scissors. I've also forgotten the milk, used whole milk, and used almond milk on different occasions ... all with acceptable results. Remember to use a piece of parchment paper or lightly grease the cookie sheet before baking.

Have made these twice, and they were much better the second time--actually really good!--so here are my tips to making the best of the recipe.
1. Make sure the bananas are really ripe. Mine had  some brown  spots on the fruit under the peel.
2. I increased the unsweetened apple sauce from 1/3 to 1/2 cup.
3. Don't stint the raisins--these provide most of the sweetness. I used a cup full.
4. I also increased the amount of cinnamon, to at least 2 tsps.
5. I used skim milk rather than almond milk the second time around--no difference that I could detect. 
6. I added a lot of walnuts--at least 1 cup, coarsely chopped--you could add more. To me these are the best part. 
7. When you put the dough on the cookie sheet, flatten them into a  cookie shape--the dough does not melt and spread out like other cookie doughs, so the shape you put in is what comes out.
8. I forgot to grease the cookie sheet but I think it would be a good idea--the cookies do stick a bit.

These are delicious for breakfast with coffee, and would be great to have handy for a breakfast on the road as required.

They turned out wonderfully, with thanks to the many intrepid bakers who offered great suggestions and substitutions. Here are some of my own: DRY INGREDIENTS - added 1/2 cup cranberries, 1/2 cup toasted chopped walnuts, 1/3 cup shredded coconut, 2 tbsp ground flax seed, 2 tbsp wheat bran, 1/2 tsp kosher salt AND two tiny packages of Italian "Vanillin" powder (brand: Cusina della Nonna). WET INGREDIENTS - one tbsp blossom honey, one tbsp molasses (plus the vanilla extract as per the recipe). TECHNIQUE VARIATIONS - 1. increased oven temperature to 375 degrees F - 2. lined baking sheets with parchment paper - 3. combined wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls - 4. Baked cookies for 21-22 minutes - 5. Yield = 36 cookies. 

Gave the recipe to some friends, and one highly skeptical friend called and apologized for ever doubting me, as she thought they were fabulous. My second batch turned out better, and I accidentally used a bit less soy milk. Baking them at a higher temperature (375 degrees) for slightly longer, and by adding nuts, coconut, ground flax and wheat bran seems to have made them less bland and lumpen. All I know is that they are the best healthy cookies I've ever made, and I'm grateful to Gene Payne (and all the wonderful reviewers) for this excellent and highly adaptable recipe.

Just Terrible!  I made these exactly as the recipe called for except I left out the raisins. I cooked these for 15 minutes at 350. They came out with a faint taste of banana and a consistency of rubber. I will not make these again.

Considering how healthy these are, I think they are good.  Don't make them if you are expecting a decadent dessert.  They are dense and really more of a breakfast food than a traditional cookie.

I think these are very good. I'm pre diabetic and salt restricted so I don't have to figure out any substitutions. (I like to avoid white flour, sugar and of course, salt.) However, I need the nutrition info.

I made this as written except I used regular skim milk.  What a great recipe for something that doesn't have sugar, flour, or egg!  I couldn't even tell there wasn't sugar.  It is very cake-like, rather than cookie-like, as another reviewer said.  You can skip the raisins and use sugar free applesauce to make it completely sugar free.

I made these last night and I liked them.  They turned out like a hybrid of banana bread/oatmeal cookie as they had more of a spongy consistancy.  I used Silk Almond Vanilla Milk and unsweetened applesauce.  I also sprayed the pan with "I can't believe it's not butter" and also sprayed the tops of each cookie with it prior to placing in the oven.  I cooked for the full 20 minutes.  Makes for a great grab for breakfast or a little snack for anytime of the day. (it's not a cookie consistancy though)

I've been making two batches of these a week. I substitute the apple sauce with crushed pineapple and add about a third of a cup of coconut and omit the cinnamon. I also bake it in a 9x9 pan and cut into bars and get best results if I bake at 375° for half an hour. This recipe is a godsend in my attempt at cleaner more healthful living.

A real healthy recipe plus it is Vegan. I added frozen wild blueberries as I didnt have any raisins and it was really good.
I work in a restaurant, so long hours and barely any time to eat. They are simply perfect and keep me going until midnight. 

Why do people who love sugar thought it was a good idea to try this recipe in the first place!?!

The title clearly say NO SUGAR :)

These are HORRIBLE!!  Taste like wet rubber!  I was at least expecting them to have a little crispiness to them.  I followed recipe as stated and even cooked them a little more because they weren't even crisp.  Will never make again!!

These are fantastic! I add different ingredients every time - chia seeds, hemp seeds, sunflower seeds, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, dried apricots, dried pineapple. Pretty much any dried fruit works well. The variations are endless! They're a perfect breakfast on the go!

I just made it. I should have added brown sugar since I used unsweetened applesauce. Kids ate some. Like someone mentioned before it is like baked oatmeal, so I'll be having them for breakfast.

I know they are not your exotic sugar sweet cookie that most lovers enjoy, but if you wish to eat well, they are comfortably good for taking the craving away.

I think these were great.  I took the advice of some of the people that made these and added peanut butter and I did chocolate chips instead of raisins.  I only had skim milk and I didn't bother with the cinnamon.   I'm not a huge banana fan, so I used a mixer to beat the bananas instead of mashing.  Occasionally I still got a lump of banana so next time I will beat them even longer.   I made them slightly larger and got 19 of them.  I worked up the nutritional info and mine worked out to 3 pts each on weight watchers.  They definitely have more of a muffin consistency than a cookie.  Now I just have to keep myself from plowing through all 19 of them!

I first had these cookies when our intern made them and brought them into the office.  I loved them!  After baking them myself, I realize it reminds me a little bit of baked oatmeal, but they are really good when your watching your calorie/carb/sugar intake.  I didn't use raisins, instead I used dark chocolate chips and I didn't have applesauce but I did have apple butter that my mom had made so I went with that.  Great recipe for those cravings and you aren't killing your diet!

These are easy and good. They taste strongly of banana but I like that taste so I'm good. I made cookies and a sheet.  In a 9x13 cake pan and they are about an inch thick.  It worked really well.

Great healthy recipe!  I used dark chocolate chips in place of raisins.  I've made these cookies two times. The first time I added Trader Joes organic peanut butter. Both times I shared with friends. Everyone wants the recipe!!  I'll try the recipe next time without adding the extra calories.

definitely better with peanut butter.  Play around with what you add such as dark chocolate chips, walnuts, various dried fruits.  Since they are so quick and easy, I may even try one batch with bacon and chipotle.  what could possibly go wrong.

I have been making these cookies for awhile now. I always add something different to change them up. I just made a batch and I just had to share what I did. I eliminated the raisins, I added 1 cup of toasted coconut flakes and some tiny dark chocolate chips. I also added 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg. So good....just right for a little something sweet when your trying so hard to still eat healthy!

My husband is diabetic so I gave these a try adding 1/2 cup natural peanut butter to the recipe as another reviewer had recommended.  We both loved them! They are soft & chewy & really yummy. Next time will try adding a different dried fruit or some chopped nuts or coconut to change things up a bit.

I substituted quick oats for the rolled oats but did everything else as stated in recipe.  Not in love.  I would eat them if provided to me  but don't think I'll make them again.

Just didn't like these.  The kids didn't like them either, which leaves them for me to eat....which I really don't want to do.  We're not sugar fanatics, and I make things like this a lot (no sugar, flour, etc.), but these just didn't do it for me.

I made the recipe as is except used soy milk and unsweetened applesauce.   They were good. A little bland. Maybe almond milk would have made them sweeter.

I added dried cranberries and pecans and increased cinnamon as many reviewers suggested. These have an odd sponge-like texture. The oats, nuts and berries break up that weird texture, but I probably will not repeat this recipe.

I was sceptical of this at first not tasting good. But oh they are so tasty and kicks that sweet taste I search for. I added peanut butter and chocolate chips. I used cinnamon applesauce. I will definitely be making these again.

My husband who is diabetic, and I have a sugar sensitivity both loved these! I used cinnamon applesauce and added pecans. It really hits the spot when you are craving something sweet and you need to fight that craving right in its ugly tracks!

After reading the reviews. I did make a few changes. I used cranberries and almonds . I also added a half a cup of Splenda. I thought they turned out really good. A healthy tasty alternative to oatmeal cookie. I will make them again.

I made these cookies and hoped they would satisfy my nightly cravings for a sweet treat. I’ve been on a healthier lifestyle journey. Cutting sugar, flour, butter, cows milk and egg yolks. This recipe was a perfect solution to add to my snack list. I must admit that I altered the recipe a bit :)... I added two small boiled sweet potatoes, nutmeg, zest of a tangerine and 1/4 cup of 50% less sugar dried cranberries.  I may try adding chopped prunes or dates the next time.

Seriously?  I'm irritated with this recipe and myself for wasting my time and good ingredients on these bland-tasting,  spongy lumps that laid like a rock in my stomach. People don't seem to know what good baking really is.

Wait! What? No flour? No sugar? I had to try because a friend is diabetic and misses home made cookies. I made them just as written, except I used  1/4 cup of Sunny D drink. I hate Almond milk. Fast and easy to put together and cooked fast. I made 4 big cookies with my muffin top pan and 12 regular size cookies. Three of the cookies had added chocolate chips for me! I'm not a big fan of oatmeal, but darn these are really good! Will make again.

These were great! I followed the recipes and they came out gooey in the middle. They looked like they weren’t done but I figured I was harmless because there was no egg. I brought them to an event and everyone love them. They are great. Definitely make these but don’t expect regular cookies. Expect chews.

These are great!  Instead of raisins I used cranraisins and it was a hit at my work.  Something with no processed sugar is great but I am thinking of trying it with peanut butter in substitute of the applesauce and see how that comes out leaving out the cranraisins.  Maybe put in some nuts or flax seed.

Looking for a no sucrose cookie and these are great for that search. I added chocolate chips (I know, sugar) and a squirt of stevia, left out the milk and added a T of no sugar peanut butter.  Baked at 375 for 15 minutes and then the next pan for 20 minutes.  The 20 minute pan was perfect...crispy edges which made them yummier!

I put in a 1/2 C of pure applesauce and a bit more raisins. The first batch tasted more like bananna bread and were a little mushy. But tasted good. Im trying them a second time but in a 9 x 13 pan to cut into bats. My hubby likes them.

I followed some suggestions from the comments and which were very helpful.  Thought I would compile what I did differently:

1/2 cup chopped walnuts added
1/2 of applesauce instead of 1/3
Maybe my oven is different but I cooked it for 14 minutes and I usually go for right between the suggested times but I was worried about these drying out and they were perfect at 14, very moist so keep an eye on them.

This cookie is more of a cake type cookie (no crunch or crisp at all). It is a very good and healthy option that's  forgiving in the way of ingredients.  Will make again but will use this as a base to tweak until it is to my likings

These are by far the best healthy cookies I've ever made. A few suggestions: Add way more raisins that the recipe calls for. I did almost a full cup. Also, I added some dates, which helped with the sweetness. Apart from that, this recipe is amazing!

I am currently not eating added sugar, dried fruit or fruit juice so I swapped chopped walnuts instead of raisins,  1/4 cup of shredded unsweetened coconut, doubled the almond milk and a pinch of salt. I also couldn't find my cookie tray so I made them in a muffin tin (1/4 cup drops) greased with coconut oil for about 20 minutes. I am amzed at how good they are!! I can't wait to add some unsweetened carob chips next time! Thanks for the recipe!!

My partner and I are observing lent that prohibits consumption of dairy and eggs. I was looking for some vegan cookie recipes and was very glad to find this one that listed ingredients that I always  have on hand. Thanks to helpful suggestions, made this recipe twice already. The first time I made these with small addition of 1/4 cup brown sugar and used 1 1/2 cups of oats and 1/2 cup of flax seeds, and I kept them in the oven for 10 extra minutes. The cookies were good, soft on the inside, a bit chewy, but since my partner likes his cookies sweeter, I added 1/3 cup of maple syrup the second time and substituted almond milk with orange juice.  They came out much tastier with enough sweetness and same soft consistency. Half a batch is already gone. My daughter was helping me make the cookies and she also loved the flavor. Thanks to the author and all reviewer suggestions, will definitely make them again, want to try with chunky peanut butter....

I made these for a church social for the diabetics and they were a huge hit with everyone!  Those were the first plate to be eaten. I will make them for the grandkids next.  They are that good and sweet.

I wouldn't call it a cookie as much as a little granola-like bite, but a nice little healthy sweet treat

This is the first time I've ever had to rate a recipe from Allrecipes this lowly.  These no-sugar cookies are not at all good tasting.  They came out dry and tasteless (but for a sort of faint, dry, baked banana taste).   If I ever made them again (which I won't), I'd maybe increase the apple sauce and leave out the bananas.  I did include the optional raisins (thankfully).  Because they were so terrible and hating to waste food, I put them in an airtight container in the freezer for later.  Thawed, they are now rubbery.  I even tried breaking them up in cold milk with artificial sweetener -- possibly they could work as a cold breakfast cereal.  Nope.  Unfortunately, the remaining ones are going into the trash.  Even for diabetic diets, I've tasted better things.

I made the recipe as is, and the texture was pretty bad.  Very bland and dry.

I made the recipe a second time; omitted the apple sauce (too much sugar) and replaced it with 2 whole eggs.  I used reduced fat coconut milk instead of almond milk, I used 2 tsp vanilla and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon.  I added a 1/2 tsp salt as well.  I cooked at 350 until the edges started to brown.  

The texture is still very cakey, but not spongy like the original recipe.  I find them easier to eat this way.

Really simple and tastes good.  I added some peanut butter  and pecans.  Cooked it at 375 for 21 minutes to get the cookies to have more texture.

I didn't make any changes, I followed the exact recipe & it was so delicious! I was worried that the bananas would be an overpowering taste especially sense mine were extremely over ripe, but there was a perfect balance of everything in these cookies. I came up with 12 regular sized cookies which isn't that much to me & they're healthy so I ate them all (:

I make it just the way it is or I add cranberries or chocolate chips. Sometimes I reduce the oatmeal and use coconut or almond flour. I add chia and flax too. It's super versatile.

I felt good serving this to my two year old as a snack and letting her help me make them! These hit the cookie craving spot without the guilt. I would definitely make them again. Oh, I should probably mention that I didn't have applesauce so I threw in three tablespoons of peanut butter instead.

I've modified the recipe slightly by adding a chocolate chip and substituting sometimes almond with ricecmilk - this way my very picky toddler eats them whenever he sees them. I also bake them at higher temperature, at 200C, then it really takes 20min. At 175C as in the original revipe, you need more time in fact to get done.

I am so happy with this recipe. I made a few changes based on Joanna's input. (Thanks, Joanna.) I increased the applesauce to 1/2, and I used strawberry applesauce. I added a full cup of dried cranberries. I made sure the bananas were overripe -- soft and perfect. I also made sure the bananas were well blended - no lumps. I doubled the vanilla and cinnamon, too. (Cuz I love those flavors.) These would have been super healthy, but I added a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate bits. (Not that they needed them.) The texture was more like a fruit bread than a cookie which was fine by me. My husband and son liked them, too. Oh yeah. I will be making these again. I think I will add pecan pieces next time!

Just tried this recipe and love it. I'm doing a no junk food challenge and these are perfect for my sweet cravings. I didn't have any bananas so I stewed some apples and mashed them up. I am not fond of raisins, I substituted with dried mixed berries.

Made these for my diabetic husband,  we both loved them .       I only had 2 bananas,  they very very ripe, so I added an extra  
1/4 cup oatmeal .     
    Also added chopped walnuts &  pumpkin seeds .    
     Baked them in convection for 15 min.  
    Will definitely make these again .  
     Thank you for sharing this recipe !

I added one organic egg, 1/4 cup of brown rice flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tbs agave (light)
they are fluffy, cakey, not sweet but def serve to replace a cookie or brownie craving, made them in a bread pan shallow, cut into strips, or bars and made 5 big cookies

I really enjoyed these 'cookies'. I wanted a sugar free snack for my toddler and I love them for myself-very healthy. They aren't cookie consistency or taste though but are an easy to make and are a healthy pick me up so I'll add these to our weekly intake.

I needed a recipe for a friend who is diabetic and this recipe said NO SUGAR  oatmeal cookies.  Well that is NOT TRUE. There may not be any added sugar but there is sugar in the bananas, applesauce, raisins and even the vanilla.  They taste good of course. But don't be fooled. There IS hidden sugars. Just be aware of this.

This recipe is great. I have played with it a lot. I've added various nuts, different types of morsels,  different flavors of sugar free applesauce,  etc. This last batch I used butterscotch morsels, vanilla almond milk and pumpkin spice in lieu of cinnamon. Absolutely wonderful!

These were really good.  I made them without the raisins only because I didn't have any in my pantry.  Next time I'm going to add walnuts or dates.  I use them as a mid morning and mid afternoon snack instead of the protein bars that I usually use.  I like them much better and feel healthier eating them and not processed bars.

These are awesome healthy treats, but you need to be realistic on your expectations. They are NOT oatmeal cookies. They are good treats for people who limit their sugar intake. I read all the suggestions and added unsweetened coconut, shaved 85% dark chocolate, and raisins.

These are very versatile, I regularly sub coconut, chips chia/ flax seeds, as long as you have 1 cup of oatmeal the rest works, though mine are allways too watery to add the milk so I skip it.

I used craisins insteas of raisins. It balanced the banana better. I also added some nutmeg. They taste divine!

Sooo good! Perfect recipe for my one and three year old. I only use three ingredients for them cinnamon applesauce, vanilla almond milk, and bananas.

Two words. Bland rubber. This was not even close to edible. What a waste of good ingredients.

Great "lower your cholesterol too" recipe, I added teaspoon baking soda and 1/4 of flour. After they came out of oven I put a dab of honey on every other cookie, it really gave it the extra sweet taste if needed.  Otherwise 100% super healthy, I would recommend eating these daily if you intend on using Oatmeal for cholesterol reduction.

I made this today. I did not use any raisins but added chia seeds, flaxseeds, and sunflower seeds. It gave a really nice nutty flavour. Definitely making more of these. Great way to snack healthily.

Please, please be sure to grease the cookie sheet first. Mine stuck badly and I had to rebake them a bit on the greased sheet.
Taste isn't bad. Better than some boxed no sugar items I've had. I'll try a few variations with the ingredient amount to see if they come out better.

I can eat this for breakfast everyday! Definitely not your usual oatmeal raisin cookie as it is a little on the dense, filling side (1-2 and you're good); but one you can actually feel good about (no artificial sugar at all). Same recipe ratio can be used for muffins, though cooking time should be about 8-10 mins more.  Must try!

The banana was just too over powering for me. It just didn't remind me of an oatmeal cookie. However, my husband, who likes bananas, thought it was great. My picky 4 yr old didn't like it, but my 1 yr old did.
