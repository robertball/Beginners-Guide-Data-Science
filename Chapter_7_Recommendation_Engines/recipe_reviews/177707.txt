I altered this recipe a bit.  So I'm going to give you my take on the altered version.  First, I didn't see the need for the flour, so I skipped it.  I think that is where a lot of the other reviews stating blandness have stemmed.  Instead I put the seasonings directly on the chicken. For seasonings I used garlic powder, red pepper and paprika as the recipe stated but I omitted the black pepper while adding seasoning salt and onion powder.  I sliced my chicken breasts (3 breasts) thin and rubbed the seasonings in to coat then browned the chicken in the skillet with the butter.  Once cooked through, I set the chicken aside and poured about 1/4 cup white wine in the skillet and loosened all the goodness in the pan.  Afterward I added a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh minced garlic, the soup and about a cup of mushrooms.  Let them simmer for a few minutes, then I added the sour cream (Only two tablespoons of sour cream not a full container) and the chicken back to the pan and let simmer for about five or so more minutes, just until heated through.  I served it with seasoned rice and mixed veggies.  It was so good.

Despite all the spices, the chicken wasn't very flavorful. I recommend using tablespoons of the spices instead of teaspoons. Next time I think I'll also add spices to the gravy. It's a very easy recipe, so it's worth playing around with.

I wish I had batteries but since I'm out I couldn't take a picture this time.  I'm glad I went for it anyway.  I made minor changes.  I used only half of the amount called for of the cayenne, I cooked the chicken and set it aside I added some sliced mushrooms to the butter, cooked it and then added the soup and about a 1/2 cup of milk.  Placed the chicken back in the pan and kept an eye on it while it completed the last 10 minutes of cooking.  It was great.  I just thought that it needed salt and had to add some afterwords.

We loved it!  I did not use the green onions...I fried up some white onion slices with potato slices in a separate pan instead, which was my side next to the paprika chicken.

WOW! I have a duplex with my sister and we cook for each other's families 2 days a week. It's very hard to find a recipe that all 9 people like. (4 adults and 5 kids) This was a hit with every one!  I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

I hated it, but my husband called it "tasty" and the kids ate it, but didn't comment either way.  I give it a 3 based on my husband's opinion and the ease of making it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The soup was way too overpowering.  I wont make again.

I made this for supper about oh,30 minutes ago, it was very good but I do have some things to say about it. To me,you need to double up on the spices, even with the paprika,ground red pepper,other spices, it was just like a piece of fried chicken,well,somewhat better but you still need to double up. The 'gravy' made of cream of chicken & sour cream was fantastic!

Been making this for years and years. Only thing different is that I use bone in breasts, skin and all, simmer in gravy about an hour after browning.

Delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic.  The crust the seasonings made around the chicken was soo good and then adding the gravy on top made it spectacular.  My fiance ate all of his chicken and even had the rest of mine.  I will definitely be adding this to the rotation!

I have been making this recipe for 30 yrs. but I ALWAYS substitute Campbell's Cream of Celery for a very delicate gravy. WE like the dark meat so I brown a whole chicken (pieces) & add a LARGE sauteed diced onion to the mix. True Paprika demands the onion. Also never spare the paprika. :))))))

This is a wonderful recipe.  It is easy to follow the instructions a minimun of ingredients and Very tasty.  It is even good without the sour cream.   I also have added 1/4 to 1/2 cup chicken broth to thin the soup to a gravy consistancy.  Very very good.  I keep this recipe and is one of my go to's for chicken dinners.  As we eat a lot of boneless skinless chicken.

I think next time, I'll let the chicken cook alone, and get nice and crispy. And just serve the sauce on the side.  But it was really good!

Very good!!! I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used chicken tenders.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and upped all seasonings added (except cayenne) to a tbsp.  This was so good, both kids were licking their plates to get all the sauce.  Will make again because it was good, not to mention easy!

I'm partially giving this 5 stars for how easy it is along with how tasty it is. Both my husband and I really enjoyed this dish. The sourcream and cream of chicken soup go well together. Definitely will be making again, especially on a busy day!

Have made a few different times. This recipe is great with improvisations. It's great the way it is but there are times I have to use different ingrediants based on what's in the fridge. No matter what I do it's great. The coated chicken is so nice and you can do whatever you want with the sauce.

I just made this for dinner tonite. I changed it around a little bit tho. I had a leftover chipotle chile in the fridge so i threw it in the processor with the sour cream and cream of chicken. AWESOME!!! It came out spicy (just the way I like it) and creamy. I served it over white rice. Will definitly make this again.

Absolutely wonderful....I had to double the recipe the 2nd time because every one was so disappointed that there were no left overs for lunch the next day. 
The only think I would change in the recipe would be to cut the chicken breasts into tenders, it was faster to cook and you can easily feed 4 people with 2 chicken breasts.

This is GREAT, and simple! I use low fat creme soup and fat free sour cream, and it tastes just the same as when I made it with the regular stuff! I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it was wonderful! Great comfort food, and I just used plain old paprika.

My mother made something similar. She used cream of mushroom soup mixed with chicken boullion and water, and added the sour cream right away. Place chicken breasts in a baking dish, pour sauce over, cover and bake until the sauce is bubbly and the chicken is done. The sauce is great on mashed potatoes too!

I thought this was a GREAT basic recipe. It is super easy to build upon. Cheap, and pretty quick to make. I did double all of the spices except the red pepper (my hubby doesn't like spicy food). This recipe makes TONS more gravy than you need though. I would suggest making it with noodles or something because the gravy was almost to much with just the chicken. But very flavorful. Overall this is a keeper.

I thought this was very tasty & super quick to pull together during a work day evening, the sauce is very thick and makes more then enough for 2 people- this is my 2nd time making this dish & will keep in my rotation for an easy chicken breast dinner during a month's rotation.  I thought it was tasty but after reading other people's comments, I doubled the indgredients b/c we like spice.

I made this for dinner last night and served it with egg noodles and broccoli.  The end result was really bland in my opinion.  I followed the recipe exactly with one minor exception, I used diced white onion instead of green because that's what I had on hand.  The end result was a very pale "gravy" that only tasted like sour cream.  This recipe needs a lot more flavour, salt, pepper and about half the amount of sour cream in order for it to be a good dish.

I like this recipe...it's yummy, creamy, and easy. I prefer using chicken tenderloins in a lot of my chicken recipes (about 2 tenderloins= 1 breast). IMO, they're more tender and easier to cook. I like to bread my chicken...dredge in egg, flour/paprika, etc mixture then let cook for a while in the sauce. Good with noodles, IMO :)

Made recipe pretty much as it was.  I doubled the flour mixture and put it in a plastic bag so I could shake the chicken (I cut it into small pieces).  You could always dip it in a liquid and recoat pieces before sauteing.  I had no sour cream on hand, so I ended up using a mixture of heavy cream and cream cheese.  Sounds odd, but it tasted pretty good.  I ended up using 3/4 c heavy cream and about 1/4 c cream cheese.  Next time, I would use more cream and find a way to "melt" the cream cheese before I put it in the dish, but it still worked.

As a side note...dish needed salt.  I had already put some in the flour mixture, but the end, I had to add a little bit more.  Also, be sure to mix the sour cream or other into the sauce well otherwise it tends to stay wherever you put it.

Pretty darn yummy stuff here.  I added some fresh baby portabellas that I sauteed in pan after the chicken.  Also added just a bit of chicken broth to thin out the soup a bit - was kinda glumpy (did use the lowfat soup and sour cream).  Served it over some linguini with some cooked carrots and crusty bread and everyone had smiles.  Conversation was at a minimum due to mouths constantly filled with this food.

We loved this recipe!! My husband isn't a fan of chicken at all, but we are adding this to our monthly meal plan.  I took the chicken breasts and split them in half length wise and they cooked faster. The only thing about the recipe in general is I felt the chicken was moist enough and flavorful enough we didn't need to even use the gravy, so we wasted it. I wont make the gravy again.

This dish is bland.  Season the chicken first and then double the seasoning in the flour.  I did not care for the gravy at all.  It was pretty good until I added the sour cream.

This is great! Very similar to the Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe that is on this site, but super easy. That is my husbands favorite recipe I make and he says this is a very close comparison. Yumm! Next time I will try adding a little white cooking wine, but I made it as is and it is great.

This was very easy and flavorful!  My husband has rated the 2nd best thing I make (he loves lasagna) and I think it might be my new favorite meal.  Even our 14 month old loved it.  I sauteed some garlic in with the onion and soup...other than that no deviations, perfect!

I doubled the spices like others suggested (except for the red pepper), and I had the worst heartburn!  Plus, it still didn't have much flavor.  I think it just needs a tad a salt to bring out all the flavors, not doubling the spices.

Amazing. Easy and the taste was great.  We thought it was all perfect amounts of everything.  I did put a few tablespoons of low salt chicken broth in the gravy-to get to consistency we like. I used regular cream of chicken soup.  I also removed the chicken to a serving platter before stirring in the sour cream.  My husband loved the entire meal, I made it with the maple dill carrots off this site (they sound odd, but those were really good as well), and some long grain and wild rice.  We even ate the gravy with the wild rice  because the gravy was so good.  I would make this meal just as I made it (with apple dumpling for dessert) to serve to guests-at my husbands suggestion.  My husband LOVED this.  It will be a staple at our house.

Okay..I remade this dish tonight. And it is very easy to make. I did again use tablespoons versus teaspoons and it made the chicken flavorful. I got to use some fresh chives...and even my husband wanted me to make this again. I also did use probably more paprika then is required....but I've started just adding stuff more to my families taste.

Good comfort food! I will be making this recipe again. The chicken is moist and tender, and the gravy is delicious. I accidentally added the sour cream to the cream of chicken soup before returning the chicken to the pan to simmer, and the gravy turned out smooth and tasty.  Also, I browned the chicken in olive oil, instead of butter.  It's similar to the Hungarian dish chicken paprikash and very easy to make.

This was good, not great.  I could see this becoming a good starting off point, especially in the winter and when I'm craving creamy food.  My husband didn't care for it as much, mainly because he is a bit fat-phobic and thinks even low-fat sour cream is cursed.

My husband loved this! Told me to make sure and keep the recipe. I took the advice of another reviewer and used TBSP instead of TSP for measurements and it worked great. I sauteed sliced fresh portobello mushrooms and diced Spanish onion in butter before adding soup mixture. The chicken came out very moist and flavorful, and the sauce was perfect. Served over Jasmine rice. Delicious! Would also be great served over egg noodles or angel hair pasta.

This has a great bold flavor, for those who commented that there wasn't enough flavor is crazy. My husband and I both love food's that are on the spicy side with great flavor, and this hit the spot. I love the idea of the gravy as well. This is a very easy recipe to make and I will be making it again and again!

I doubled the spices and used garlic salt instead of garlic powder which added that little bit of saltiness that it needed! Also, it made A LOT of gravy, so I think I would only make half the amount next time. Other than that, it tasted wonderful!! I would definitely make it again!

Excellent!!  The whole family raved over this meal :)  The only thing I did differently was cut up the chicken before adding it back into the skillet with the creme of chicken soup.  It made it easier to stir in the sour cream later and I didn't have to take time to cut it when time for the kids to eat.

Slightly spicy, and AWESOME!  I may try just a little more sour cream next time to mild it out.  Also, I put all the extra dry ingredients in when first sauteeing it.  It made the gravy extra thick, just how I like it.

I omitted the flour and increased the spices.  After browning the chicken I deglazed the pan with about 1/4 C of chicken stock before adding the soup and onions.  I also added a can of petite diced tomatoes to make this dish more like chicken paprikash without the work.  It waws delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will definitely make this again

This recipe was fast, easy, and delicious!  I did, however, make just a couple of minor changes. I used heaping teaspoons of all the seasonings for more flavor.  Then, I wanted my chicken to turn out like the sample picture, so I browned the chicken first in 1/2 the amount of butter and a little oil and then threw it in a 400 degree oven for about 15 min.  Then I continued with the gravy as directed and just served over the chicken.  I also thinned the gravy out with a little bit of water.  My husband and son loved it!

My husband's grandfather used to do the Campbell's version of paprika chicken, so I was excited to find this recipe.  I also added a can of cream of mushroom.  The kids Loved it.  I used chicken thighs because of family preference and seasoned with more paprika.  I also served it over egg noodles as that's the way my husband's family would eat it - they are Hungarian.

This is great, easy and just a little spicy. I cut the breasts up into small chunks or strips, then dip them into the flour mixture and then cook them up to nearly done. Doing this gives the chicken a little crispier texture. I go ahead and keep the chicken in the pan when I simmer the soup. The flavors really meld together betetr. Then I like to serve it over egg noodles (the thick frozen ones are the best). It's a huge hit in our house and great for chilly days.

I followed the recipe as is except I didn't have any ground red pepper, so I used cayenne pepper instead.
Delicious!!!!

Easy and tastes great.  I only had cream of celery so I used that - increased garlic powder and paprika, otherwise prepared as directed.  I will make this again.

I thought this was great! I followed the suggestion of doubling the spices (except for the red pepper) and it turned out very well, and very flavorful I might add. Thanks for sharing!

This wasn't flavorful enough, especially with the amount of fat in the recipe.  I don't think I would make again.  For those making it, though, I would advise adding more salt to the coating.  I even doubled the spices and it was still too bland for me.

Too much paprika for me.  Prefer regular gravy made from fried chicken pan drippings.  Obviously, I'm not in majority, so try it, esp. if you like paprika

Wow! I was pleasantly surprised at how good this recipe turned out. Here's what I did based on some of the other reviews (and what I had): 8 chicken tnederloins cut into pieces for my kids. I was very generous on the spices (mine tend to be old) and added some onion powder and a few shakes of cayenne, tossed chicken and spices/flour together in a gallon-sized bag to coat. Browned in olive oil. Added two cans of cream of chicken, thinned with some milk. Didn't have any green onions, but it was still great without. Added the sour cream at the end. Cooked fettucini noodles and mixed in with sauce and chicken before serving.  Everyone loved it, even my kids. Will definitely be making this again!

I added 1 clove of garlic with the green onions (in addition to the garlic powder already in the recipe).   My husband loved this and thought it tasted like KFC's original recipe!

I'll try this again, but with some alterations. After reading some reviews, I eliminated the flour and replaced the green onions with sliced mushrooms. I also went with 1 t Garlic powder, 1 t cayenne pepper, 2 t paprika, 1 t onion powder, 1 t black pepper, and 1 t salt for 7-8 chicken tenderloins (about 1.5 lbs). I used about 1/4 c. white wine, 2 t minced garlic, a can of condensed cream of chicken soup, and 2.5 T sour cream. I liked it okay, but it was a little spicier than I was expecting, so I'd change up the rub/spice mix next time.

Don't use as much cayenne pepper, nor do I add the green onions, but otherwise I make it the same....
