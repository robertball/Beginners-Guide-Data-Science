It's nothing fancy, but it is tasty! My husband and 5-year-old son kept taking more helpings until it was gone. My 1-year-old daughter loved it too! My 3-year-old son is another story.... 

I don't care for cream of mushroom, so used cream of celery instead. I also used frozen corn and green beans (mostly thawed in the microwave) instead of canned. 

Thanks for the recipe to use up extra mashed potatoes!

This is a great recipe with or with out additions. I took a photo, I thought it needed a visual to go along with a simple yet tasty recipe. For the photo used I used one 12 oz. bag of frozen peas and carrots along with some home grown corn that I had cut the kernels off the cob and made the recipe as directed by the poster. If you are on a budget this a great dinner option, most will find they have all ingredients on hand.

I made this version after I realized I didn't have a can of tomato soup for my normal version. I did add a chopped onion to the ground beef as I had started my normal recipe before realizing I lacked ingredients. We used fresh green beans from our garden which I steamed. As we are cutting back I used lean ground beef, fat free soup and 2% cheese. We really enjoyed it and my whole family would have had seconds if I wasn't  strictly keeping them in line. They are excited for the leftovers. Will be in our rotation as long as the bean crop continues.

I made this tonight for my family for supper. It is a good basic dish that has your starch, vegetables, and meat.  You can use a variety of vegetables (I used peas), and I added green onions to the mashed potatoes.  I finished it by broiling it in the oven until the cheese was bubbly and slightly browned. The mushroom soup gives it a real nice flavor.  My family liked it and I will make it again.

It was easy to prepare and make and I had everything on hand,instead of using salt and pepper,I splashed some soy sauce while the mixture of meat and vegetables were being cooked in the skillet,my husband who is a very picky eater asked for seconds and wants me to make this again,thank you for sharing this awesome recipe.
