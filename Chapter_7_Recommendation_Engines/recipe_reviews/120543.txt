AWESOME!  I doubled the recipe and used fresh fruit that I put through my juicer.  I'm glad I did because every stir cried out for a taste!  The taste and texture was awesome.  I'm going to make it again and freeze overnight as I feel it would make a fabulous sorbet.  Thank you Taste of Home Test Kitchen for an AWESOME recipe!

This tasted great, but relatively speaking it's a lot of time (and a bit of effort) to follow these steps, for what you get in the end. The "Prep Time" and "Ready In" times of 5 minutes each are obviously way off. I made this exactly as written, and it was over two hours until I tasted the results. I wasn't quite sure what kind of consistency I was shooting for - I found it melted fairly quickly, so it was just as well that I loved eating it. It tasted wonderful, and it'd be worth making it as a special treat for someone, but I probably won't be making it again just for myself.

Made a double batch last night, but was too tired to stay up for the stirring.  Froze 1/2 of it overnight, let it thaw a little this morning and crushed it up in a cup.  Delicious!  Then this afternoon I froze the rest in a cup, stirring every 20 minutes or so. Again, delicious!!!  Might try freezing it in popcicle molds too.
