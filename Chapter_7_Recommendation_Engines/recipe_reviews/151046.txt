I loved this recipe but I made a few changes that made it more healthy.  I used 5 cupes of chicken broth instead of the 3 and substituted 2 cups of skimmed milk for the 2 cups of heavy cream.  It came out very creamy and extremely tasty.  It was a smash with my husband. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I tryed using puree potatoes instead of cream, cup for cup.  Instead of having a fatting soup I felt guilty about later, I had one that everyone including my lactose intolorent grandmother loved.

This is a really nice soup!  I made a few changes, but the underlying idea was the same.  I only had one head of cauliflower and had to use onion instead of shallots because my store didn't have shallots.  I also used an entire bulb of garlic.  I subbed 1% milk for cream to lighten it up and added a dash of crushed red pepper and a handful of shredded cheddar (i forgot to adjust the milk for less cauli and needed to thicken it up a bit).  This is not the most visually appealing soup, but it tastes GREAT!  I will reduce the thyme a little next time per personal preference.

I made this soup after I read many reviews.  I used 1 head of cauliflower, added 2 potatoes and 2 large carrots, added 7 large cloves of garlic and 3 shallots tossed them all in 1/4 cup EVO, layered on a roasting pan then sprinkled with ground pepper and sea salt and roasted. I upped the chicken stock to 4 and left out the water. I also added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream. After I blended everything with a hand immersion blender I added 1/2 cup of both freshly grated Asiago & 1/2 cup of Old Cheddar and salt and pepper to taste.  Amazing.  Garnished it with fresh bacon bits, fresh chives a few pieces of roasted Cauliflower florets and a little of the grated cheese blend. and served it home made buttermilk biscuits (recipe from Allrecipes)  Great for this cold rainy fall day.

This was exceptional!  I used potatoes in it as another reviewer had suggested and added a small amount of cream at the end.  Delicious.

I have made this a couple of times now b/c my BF has declared it his favourite soup (and I make A LOT of soup). Both times I only used one head of cauliflower, and added some combination of carrots, turnips, and potatoes - which is nice b/c then I can use up whatever is in the fridge. Both times I did add 4 cups of broth (no water) and no heavy cream, milk or any other substitute. The soup is already thick and rich enough in my opinion.

My wife and I loved this soup. I used half-and-half, and reduced the roasting time to about 20 mins. (I made half the recipe). I also added a little more broth than the recipe called for to get the consistency right. It was absolutely delicious.

Great flavor, but be careful not to burn the cauliflower.  Had to start all over again, but it was worth it!

Very yummy. Used milk instead of cream. Left some chunks of cauliflower for texture. Also added about 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch.

This is tasty!!  I only had one head of cauliflower so I cut down the liquids a little bit and used skim milk to lighten it up.  Be careful not to burn the garlic when you are roasting the cauliflower!  Added lots of black pepper, too!  Thanks for sharing.

For those who can do the heavy cream, go that route. With only two of us here, and both watching the fat grams, our version used 1 generous head of cauliflower, 2 cloves garlic, two shallots,1/2 T. olive oil, one 14 ounce can chicken broth, 1/2 cup water, bay leaf, 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, 2 small or 1 large roasted new potato (peeled) and 3/4 cup milk. Used sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
The "slimmed" down version was delicious, and I know the creamier version would be a richer taste of the same.

The cauliflower took about 20 minutes to roast; 30 would have been way too long. I didn't bother pureeing it, I just smooshed it up with a potato masher so that it was a little chunky. Even on a hot day, I really enjoyed this. Had it for lunch with some crusty bread. Delicious. Thanks!

I only had one small head of cauliflower so only used 2 cans of broth and a half cup of water.  Left herbs, garlic and shallots same. Used half and half and fat free milk.  And I covered roasting pan with foil so shallots and garlic didn't burn.  after 30 minutes turned off oven and let pan sit, uncovered, for another 15 min. OK it added to cooking time but veges had great flavor--love roasted flavors but hate burnt garlic.

I tweaked the recipe a bit. Added a large whole carrot and some diced red onion to roasting pan. Roasted 30 minutes as indicated. I sauteed some sweet onion (about 1/3 of a large onion) in olive oil and butter, and added cauliflower, shallots, carrots and red onion to the pot. Used fresh thyme because I had it on hand in my garden (yes in December in MICHIGAN my Thyme plant is still alive!) Used 2 cups chicken broth and 1/2 cup water. Added a dash of nutmeg. I made a roue instead of fooling with a food processor, and mashed the cauliflower with a potato masher (just as I do when I make cream of broccoli). Very versatile soup, and loved the creamy flavor!

This was OK.  I love soups, but it just didn't do it for me.  I noticed (after making it) that several of the reviewers who raved about it added other things (like carrots).  Maybe that's the trick to making it better.  I think I'll just stick to straight up roasted cauliflower and make soups out of other things.

5 stars for simple excellence! I'm a big texture fan, so I will add more cauliflower next time to leave some good chunks in the soup. It needs to be blended as written to get the right consistency to it. Very good, thanks!

This was really good. My husband and I both loved it. Unfortunately, cauliflower is often pretty expensive- but we got two heads on sale and decided to splurge! Since the soup was the entree (we had it w/bread), it was inexpensive, healthy, and delicious. I did everything pretty much like the recipe said. Bon apetite!

Recipe as stated has a very good flavor.  The consistency is more like oatmeal than a cream-based soup.  Perhaps more broth would help, or maybe dice the cauliflower and leave some of it in pieces, instead of pureeing the whole thing.  I garnished with grated cheddar, and I feel that crumbled bacon would make a great addition to the cheddar (if you can afford the extra calories).

Overall a good starter recipe, but definitely not outstanding.  The only substitution I made was I used 2% milk instead of cream.  Next time I will likely use 8 or 9 cloves of garlic and I'll just peel and throw in the roasting pan.  To make the soup more visually appealing, I served in a brightly colored ramkin and I garnished with asiago cheese (really nice flavour addition!), topped with a small slice of swiss cheese topped with green onion and croutons and I roasted it under the broiler until the top was browned and bubbly.  Looked elegant and very appetizing.

I had a head of cauliflower to use up and was going to make mashed cauliflower, but decided to make this instead. Glad I did, it was so good. Will definitely make again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful soup!  I subbed the heavy cream with soy sour cream thinned with a bit of soy milk to get the right consistency.  I used 4 cups of home made broth (no fat) and left out the water.  Served topped with home made bacon croutons and fresh parsley.  Will make again!

Excellent!  I quartered two small yellow onions and roasted them and a whole garlic head with the cauliflower.  Then dumped all of them in the soup pot.  I also added about 1 cup of finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese at the end.  And I left out the thyme (not a fan).

This recipe is fabulous! Like most here I had to add my own style to it. Being the southern girl that I am, I add bacon, cayenne, and completely  omit the shallots for 1 plain yellow onion. I do not like roasting the onion and garlic with the cauliflower because it does tend to burn. So I just cut the top off of a whole head of garlic drizzle a little olive oil and sprinkle a little salt and wrap it in foil then throw it in the oven, next to the pan of cauliflower to roast. When you can smell it, it's done! The bacon is cut in small pieces fried down, strain the grease set bacon aside and sauté the onion in the same pan. Follow through with all the rest of the ingredients and add a dollop of light sour cream and bacon pieces, to plate!  This has become the go to soup, for our Secret Sister, girls night out! ;) A favorite for sure!!!! Thanks for Sharing!

This is a great soup and super yummy. However, I feel like it needs an extra kick to make is 5 stars. We added a small dash of cayenne pepper. Plus had cheese and bacon for toppings, if desired. I highly recommend the recipe, but without an extra something it is quite bland.
Like other reviewers, I only roasted for 20 minutes and that was plenty of time. I also added 4 cups of broth and no water for more flavor.

Not a big cauliflower fan, but roasting this definitely makes it taste like potatoes!  I'm doing low carb South beach, so I added 1 cup of skim milk and 1 cup of light cream.  It probably doesn't even need the cream, and I'm definitely going to make this again.  The roasted cauliflower on its own was delicious too.

Very good!  Only drawback is the roasting of the vegetables made the whole house stink like garlic!  While not a bad smell, it's definitely overpowering.  Regardless, soup was excellent.

This was just amazing soup. I did tweak it to suit my tastes and what was on hand. I roasted 3 carrots, 4 cloves of garlic and 1/4 of a medium onion along with the cauliflower. I increased the chicken broth as I only had a cup of 1/2 and 1/2. I used a stick blender and got a wonderful consistency. Added the 1/2 and 1/2 at the end. After eating the first bowl to which I added dill weed; I decided it was so good, I added it to the whole soup. Dill makes almost any veggie dish taste so much better. I'll be making this often. Thanks TOZENUF  for the great recipe.

So, if anyone is wondering what this is like, as I did, think along the lines of a creamy potato soup.   And even though I used half - n - half, and only a cup, it seemed very rich too me.   

To other posters who had problems with the garlic burning...just roast whole cloves instead of chopping them.  They get blended up anyway.   

Good soup, different.  Didn't knock my socks off though.

Followed recipe exactly. Found that the garlic and shallots burned while being roasted. I would leave them whole next time or at very least just cut them in half. When it was ready I decided that it just needed a little something. Added some cayenne pepper and that seemed to do the trick. This was a nice soup on a cold day. Thank you TOZENUF.

This was pretty good, but I made a few changes.  I roasted the cauliflower with oil, salt, and pepper.  Then I sauteed the garlic and onions before adding the stock and water.  Worked great and it was yummy.  Served it with toasted pine nuts on top...that really made it amazing.

This came out really good. I think it's the roasting with the garlic and shallots that make the flavor. I had big heads of cauliflower so increased some of the ingredients (6 cloves of garlic, 4 cups of chicken broth) Used whole milk instead of heavy cream...then decided it needed something so added a couple tablespoons of butter. You could probably adjust this different ways and still have something good.

Very good and relatively easy to make. I didn't have fresh cauliflower so I opened three 10 oz packages of frozen cauliflower, spread the florets on a cookie sheet, sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled generously with garlic powder before roasting. I added a pinch of cayenne to the pot while simmering. At the end I used one cup heavy cream and one cup skim milk, and it turned out really well. Will definitely make this one again.

So delicious and nutritious!  I added some extra veggies and tofu, and served this over bulgur.  Mine turned out chunkier than the other versions pictured, but I kinda like it that way.  Mmm will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! As usual, I had to change it up a little to make it my own. Using a previous suggestion, I added about 2 cups of (leftover) baked potatoes to the pot for flavor and thickening, then used just one cup of half and half for more richness. Instead of chicken stock, I used my own veggie stock to make it a vegetarian soup. I skipped the bay leaf and used about 1 tsp of marjoram, which worked nicely with the thyme. For a little punch, I tossed in a dash of cayenne pepper! Blending it all in the pot with the immersion blender (I call it "the bopper") saved time and the washing of more bowls and appliances!

This was fabulous!  I did make quite a few changes to the recipe.  I substituted leeks for the shallots, used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (to make it vegetarian) and used milk and a tablespoon of butter instead of cream.  Just delicious.

I'm glad I tried this,it is a good soup. I made it pretty much as written, except I used 4 cups [32oz] chicken broth instead of 1 cup of water. I also used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of fat free half and half.

I used fat free half n half, reduced the thyme by half, and used an onion in place of the shallots as they are hard to find around here.  The only problem with this soup is looks.  It's not very eye-appealing, but it sure is good.  Will be making again, thank you for sharing.

Love this, it may look a little thick at first but, just be patient, when you add the cream at the end it really helps. I halved this recipe.  I didn't have a scallion so I used a white onion. When it came to the garlic I added extra(just because I love it). I used a half bulb and cut the top off and drizzled with oil and just halved the onion then added to the cauliflower in the oven.  I cooked for 20 mins then stirred and then put back in for the remainder of the 30 mins..  If you do the above, you shouldn't have the problem of them burning like others stated they had.  I did used a hand blender, this allowed me to leave some bigger pieces.  YUM

This was so delicious!  I made mine with homemade turkey stock instead of chicken broth, and I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Also, I gave the cauliflower a head start, roasting it for 15 minutes before I added the shallots and garlic, so they wouldn't scorch.

Delicious!!  My soup came out a bit thick, probably because the cauliflowers were quite large, so instead of 2 cups of cream - I put 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk.  It turned out great.  I served it topped with caramelized onions and cilantro

We loved it.....used homemade chicken stock from this site. Also used onion instead of shallot, added carrots to amp up the veggie factor and used fat free half and half.  Pureed all of the carrots with the cauliflower but also left some cauliflower chunks for texture.  Thickened with a little cornstarch/water slurry. Roasting the cauliflower really adds a lot of flavor to this soup.....don't skip this process.

I just happened to make chicken broth that morning so I used homemade chicken broth in this recipe which enhanced the flavor. I added about 4 more garlic cloves which also gave great taste to this soup. Needs a little salt but my husband and I LOVED it! Great recipe!

I didn't love this, but I have decided I'm not as big a fan of cauliflower as I thought. I also thought my onions/garlic burnt. I wish I had taken it out earlier. I had it for lunch today after adding a little bit of Velveeta/Rotel Dip. I liked it a lot better. Next time I will follow this recipe using a variety of veggies.

This was good however  I felt there was too much thyme I thought it over powered the flavor  next time I will use less.

This is a good soup.  I used half and half and will try fat free half and half or fat free milk next time.  The last time I made a Cauliflower soup it was way too "oniony," so I really liked that this one calls for shallots which gives it a much milder flavor.  Make sure not to chop them too small so they don't burn while roasting.

I followed the recipe, but found the soup have very little flavor. I then added some frozen corn and peas, but still found the soup to be very bland.  Added No Salt seasoning which brought the taste up to eatable.

This was really good. My 4 and 7 year olds also really liked it. I made it exactly as written and I wouldn’t change a thing. It’s delicious. Next time I might add a little bacon as a topping though.

The only change I made is that I used skim milk instead of cream and added 2 cups extrax broth.  Very delicious even done with a lighter twist.  This suggestion was mentioned by other reviewers.  The soup was thick enough.  I will make this again and again!

I used 1 head of cauliflower and tossed with shallots, lots of garlic and roasted 30 min.  Used 3 cups broth with bay leaf and simmered 30 min.  Used unsweetened Almond milk instead of cream or milk since I'm dairy-free to get a creamy look going and added 1/4 tsp cayenne.   Yum!

This is a great simple recipe. Depending on the cream, this soup can be a little bland. I added a little turmeric and white pepper to give it a little more kick.

This is a wonderful soup and I am grateful for the recipe as I had several bowls of something similar recently at a Hilton in Chicago and came home on a mission to replicate.  This came very close.  I have to admit tho, I did not make as written.  I have had outstanding luck with replacing the cream in many recipes with Fat Free Evaporated Milk.  This route cuts the fat by a huge amount without sacrificing the creaminess.  I used 2 can of the Evap instead of the cream and also added a dash of nutmeg as all was simmering.  I pureed it all for the lovely texture and have been enjoying this with a crusty grain roll for a diet and diabetic-friendly lunch this week.  Will absolutely make again!.  Thank you for posting this.

I made as listed.  Good, but a little bland.  Next time I will add one cup cream and maybe make the other cup whole milk.  To spruce it up when I served it I added a dollop of Frank's Wing Sauce, bacon bits and a little cheddar cheese.  Also next time I will only puree 1/2 the soup to add a little more substance.

I loved this recipe! I left out the heavy cream for health purposes and substituted for 2% milk and flour to desired thickness (or you could use corn starch instead of flour). The roasted cauliflower really makes this dish! I also garnished with some crispy bacon bits. So good!

Loved the recipe and didn't change it much - I did add some broccoli since I didn't have a full head of cauliflower  and left out the thyme for the same reason.  I used skim milk  too  so it wasn't as creamy but still rich and yummy!

I was surprised how  much better this soup tasted compared to my usual cauliflower soup. The roasting of the cauliflower made the difference. I used half and half for the cream to cut down the fat and it was still delicious.

I tweaked the recipe by adding  3 Tbsp. of olive oil instead of 1, and replaced the cream with 2 cups of coconut milk, along with one cup of old cheddar right at the end of cooking.  It was delicious!!

Like many others, I lightened it up. I used nonfat evaporated milk. Used A LOT of black pepper and garnished with crumbled bacon and parmesan cheese to honor the richness of the recipe.

Made half a recipe and sure wish I had made the whole recipe. This was absolutely delicious! I left out the thyme and bay leaf (forgot the first, didn't have the second) but want to add that next time. I did throw in a handful of grated cheese. Will definitely make again.

I received great reviews from everyone who tried it, but no one went for seconds.  I think the cauliflower leaves a not so pleasant aftertaste.  The recipe is great, so I think I will try it out with other veggies.  Thanks!

My kids love this soup.  I've only had one head of Califlower like most people, so I've added parsnips and potatoes in the roast.  (carrots are good too).  Never have tried cream but sounds delish.  Unfortunately, we can't afford the extra calories (or I can't). Lowfat and non-fat milk are fine though!

I was a little let down by this one.  I did not absolutely hate it, but was like, "Huh".  It tasted good but more as a side dish than a soup.  I added more liquid and took about half of it and  blended to make is more soup-like.  It was just "ok", like Randy Jackson from Idol would say.

Not too bad. Like other reviewers said it does not look at all appetizing but it tasted good. My family liked. Definately worth trying once but I don't think we all liked it enough for me to make it again.
