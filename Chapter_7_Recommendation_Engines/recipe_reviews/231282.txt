Perfect for a cold, rainy, late fall weekday. I even made the meatballs from scratch and it still was quick. Delish. My modifications: I used 32 oz of unsalted beef stock and 2.5 cups of water. Also used fresh garlic. Ended up having to add salt at the end, but I'm okay with that, as I'm sure it's still less than what is in fully salted beef stock or beef broth. Will definitely make this again.

This was delicious. My husband, who isn't a fan of soup, said that I can make this all winter. I ended up cutting the meatballs into smaller pieces after my son tried to nab as many as possible, and I think that's one reason my carnivorous husband liked it so much. Very meaty. I tried it w/ the pasta, but the leftovers soaked up all the liquid overnight, so next day, we started over and left it out. It made me remember why I don't put pasta in soups unless guaranteed you will consume all immediately. I would cook pasta separately and add to each bowl if you want it. It was great without to me.

Had pounds of leftover meatballs from the football game and ham broth from the spiral ham that was served.  What a fantastic way to revamp leftovers into something new and delicious. The only changes I made, was using ham broth instead of beef and a good dose of frozen spinach along with the other vegis. Thanks for a snow day meal

Three stars as written when made the first time. 
Changes that brought it up to 5 stars for us: 
1-Used homemade meatballs and shaped them extra small (Makes them easier to eat in the soup.)
2- Used frozen Normandy blend veggies instead of Italian
3- Used Pearl barley instead of pasta. 
4- Added some spinach that was on its last legs in the freezer for an additional vitamin punch! 
Really, our changes were just for texture, on the whole the flavors stayed the same. A great starter recipe to make your own!

I added an 8 oz bag of baby spinach.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Used frozen Italian style meatballs from Costco and ditalini pasta.  This is super easy to prepare, kid-friendly, and tastes really good.  I will certainly prepare this again.  May add cannelini beans next time

Simple and flavorful.  I used Cannellini white beans instead of pasta, a more savory brand of frozen meatballs, and Lipton Onion Soup mix.  Came out great.

Yummy soup. I had some meatless meatballs in the freezer so I used those.. they got a little soft so next time I'll try this with turkey or beef ones. I used half the amount of pasta and added salt and fresh pepper

I used chicken broth because I did not have beef on hand and packaged precooked chicken meatballs, Italian with mozzarella from Aidells.  The meatballs themselves have lots of flavor.  My diced tomatoes were roasted and with garlic.  I was amazed how simple, quick and delicious soup this was!  Plenty of flavor, especially considering I did not have to chop and saut√© to get there.  I will be making this again and again.  Thank you!

Sweet simple ease earned two stars, the grand slam fantastic restaurant level taste caught two more stars....40 minutes from "scratch" to dinner ready--THAT earned the 5th star!!  Do take note: made as directed, this recipe WILL make A LOT of soup; bear that in mind when you experiment with your modifications. Thank you , Ms. Call--for sharing this recipe here!

Simple and hearty! We used one can of low sodium beef broth and one regular sodium can of beef broth and the combo seemed to have the right amount of taste while managing sodium levels for us. We also added 2 cups of fresh spinach. We used Johnsonville classic Italian style meatballs. For folks who are not experienced at cooking (like us), this is a great, easy recipe to try.

This is a wonderful dish. The only change I made was to use low sodium beef broth and I think next time I make it I will take more time and use fresh veggies and meatballs not frozen. Love the meal so much I brought the whole family over to eat and gave my son the recipe.

Very easy recipe and the family loved it.  I didn't have any frozen vegetables so I cut up 3 zucchini and added 3 carrots.  I cooked the carrots first.  I also added a can of white kidney beans and would add 2 cans in the future.  I ran out of room in my pan so I only added 2 cups of water and it was delicious.

This is one of the best soups that I have ever made & I‚Äôve made a ton of soups.  I make this every week to 10 days at least.I think we all make a little customary changes and I add maybe a little bit more of the Italian seasoning, more veggies, etc without a dash of hot sauce if it‚Äôs not spicy enough for you but this is not a bland soup! And I love adding spinach to it just a little bit goes a long ways.  Fabulous soup.   And don‚Äôt be stingy with the Parmesan!

My local grocery store did not have Italian blend vegetables so I bought Normandy blend veggies.  I also let it simmer for a couple of hours - I think soups have more flavor when they simmer longer.  I think the next time I make this I will add cannelini beans.

This was ok. Nothing special but no one complained and it all got eaten. I liked the idea of using purchased meatballs, because I had a package of Aidell's carmellized onion meatballs in the freezer. Because the meatballs were chicken, I used chicken broth instead of beef broth. It might have been better with beef broth so if I make it again I'll use the trader joe's party meatballs and use beef broth.

Fantastic with changes. I was nervous because I was making this for my food truck. IT IS SO YUMMY. I used 1.5 more Italian seasoning, some pepper and basil. I used zucchini, celery and mushrooms and some onion saut√©ed first with garlic. Then did the rest as written. My customers are really enjoying it and so am I. I also used beef broth concentrate with the water.

Good soup, we made the mistake by putting too many noodles in,  put in what the recipe calls for, otherwise the noodles soak up the juice.

Used Hot Italian Sausage, instead of meatballs, as we had run out meatballs and no time to make any.  Did 3 cups beef  broth and 2-1/2 cups water.  To make it KETO friendly, used 4 cups veggies and no pasta.  Seasoned as said and we LOVED it! Such a simple, but very flavourful soup.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will try meatballs next time.

This was so easy to make, I usually do not like frozen meatballs, but they were pretty good!! You could make your  own but I look for quick dinners, since I work and I am tired when I get home!! Tasted really good!!

Quick, easy, tasty soup. Two suggestions though: 1) replace water with beef broth to make more hearty and 2) use mini meatballs rather than regular-size meatballs.

Used plain meatballs, no Italian Seasoning, and fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Doubled the beef broth and the canned tomatoes as the broth is my favorite part. Definitely will be making this soup again.

So easy, and delicious. I ended up adding more pasta (because 3 and 5 year olds...) and we used mini meatballs!! It was perfect, the kids even liked it.

Yummy! I saut√©ed fresh zucchini, squash, onion, mushrooms and celery instead of frozen In some olive oil to start. I added garlic and salt and pepper too and thought it had a wonderful flavor.  I let it cook for a full hour just to increase the flavor amongst the various items. I added a fresh spinach at the end. So good, and so healthy too, I will be making this all winter long!

Very easy.
Dinner was on the table well within 1/2 hour.  No chopping,  and minimal standing. 
Very Tastyas well as satisfying.  It is now a staple of our cool weather meals. Dinner one night and lunch the next day.  Thanks for a fine meal

While this was a simple and quick recipe, I would not make it again unless I made my own meatballs and used fresh vegetables. Also, there was a metallic taste from the canned products.

Love this soup.  Only two substitutions - what I had on hand - used chicken broth instead of beef and fresh zucchini and summer squash instead of frozen. Perfect for a quick meal after working outside in cooler weather. thanks for a great recipe, Suzanne Call. This will be made often in our house

Was so flavorful and easy to make.  
I ended up making it one day and we didn't eat it until the next day.  The meatballs had soaked up all of that yummy chicken broth!  I made the chicken broth from the carcass of a rotisserie chicken from Costco.

Not a fan.   I found the broth of this soup very bland and watery.   I tried to spruce it up at the end with more salt, maybe a little garlic.  Still unimpressed.   The only thing that IS impressive is how many 5 stars it got.   The fact that it's so fast and easy is the main selling point.   But as usual...anything worth doing, is worth doing right.    Won't be repeating this one.

Made this after seeing it in an Allrecipes email. It was ABSOLUTELY delicious. As good as any Italian restaurant. I made my own meatballs - preferring to know ‚Äú what‚Äôs in them ‚Äú and added a bit of red pepper flakes to bolden it but honestly- easy delicious and tastes EVEN  better as a leftover. WINNER!!!!!!

Delicious, quick and easy as is!   I did make a few changes. I used fresh, pre-made meatballs from the meat department simply because I had them on hand.  I also used fresh veggies vs frozen...yellow, zucchini, fresh tomatoes (in addition to the canned, I needed to use them up), onion, green beans, finely chopped kale (a sneaky way to get in extra veggies), spinach and fresh basil.  You can also use orzo or another similar small pasta.  Served with a baguette with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The fam LOVED it!

This was surprisingly delicious and so easy to make!  I say "surprisingly" because for the Italian vegetables I used a Normandy blend with broccoli and cauliflower in it. I thought that sounded odd to put in an Italian based soup, but all of the textures and flavors worked together really well!  I added more beef broth to mine, as well as more Italian seasoning and some frozen onion.  I also used low sodium tomatos (and broth!) and whole grain mini shells to make it a little healthier.  The whole gang really loved this and I will be making again!

Will definitely make this again.  Like the name says, it was very hearty. Since I used 32 oz of beef broth, I added another can of regular diced tomatoes to give it more of a tomato flavor.

Very good for the first Fall day here. Mostly followed recipe, used what veggies I had. Added onions and garlic and red pepper flakes, as we like spicy. Tasty.

Loved this recipe! I added some minced onion, garlic salt, salt&pepper, a little bit of butter, and garlic to give it some extra flavor. I love spicy food so I added some crushed red pepper to it as well. Super quick and easy and I will definitely make this again.

I am new to cooking and this recipe was really easy to do. Instead of the tomato chunks I used a tomato bisque and I didn't need to add the water. This was really delicious. Both my dad and I loved it.

Turned out good.  I had to do a few modifications because I didn't have all the ingredients in stock.  It still turned out good though.

Very quick and easy.  I only used one can of tomatoes as my son does not like them and kept them out to add at the end.  I used 1-2 small (individual) cans of tomato juice to give tomato broth.

Do not use meatballs, but Italian sausage links cut in pieces.  Trader Joes meatballs were not very good.

Very tasty dish that is quick, easy with minimal clean-up.  I used frozen mixed veggies that I had in the freezer , regular meatballs and orzo.

This is a great recipe if you're looking for a quick healthy and hearty soup! I added a little (1/2 tsp) crushed dried red pepper flakes to kick up the heat. YUM!

This was yummy and extremely simple to put together.  Great for soccer practice night when everyone's in a hurry on different schedules.
