For how easy this was, it tasted very good. I was worried I would mess it up since I did change the steps a bit, but it turned out great! Using the Instant Pot just to cook just the rice doesn't really save any time, so I sautéd the sausage and chicken with some garlic in the pot for about 5 minutes first, then turned it off and added the rice and chicken broth. I used 2 cups of broth instead of 1. Then on top of that I added all the other ingredients and spices, including one chopped jalapeño, and I put the shrimp in frozen. Mix it all together and set the Instant Pot to cook for 8 minutes, then release the pressure using the release valve. Everything was cooked perfectly.

Will definitely make again.   My husband LOVED this--requested it be immediately added to the rotation.  Left overs heated beautifully.  I am on a Keto diet so left out the rice and was still delish!!!  Thank you thedailygourmet!!!

Easy to make and the 2 steps, cooking the rice and the other ingredients separatly, I found better than other recipes. I just double the quantity of rice and chicken broth. I used a package (4) andouille, and a pound of shrimps.  At the end I put the cooked rice back in the pot and mixed in to the jambalaya.
