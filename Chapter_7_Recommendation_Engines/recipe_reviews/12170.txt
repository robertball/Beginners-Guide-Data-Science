Ok once again a southern woman talking. That said I loved this pie !!!! what I loved about it was that it's not tooth ache sweet, it is just right. I used light and dark corn syrup and I think that is what made the difference in the sweetness. Thanks Nikki for a great recipe it will be the only pecan pie I make and will pass it down.

Excellent recipe. This is the one my mother passed down. I now realize that it is the KARO syrup recipe but it is still the way to go. After making many of these pies I have a few suggestions. Use only KARO or other top of the line syrups. Also bring all ingredients to room temperature before mixing. Do not over mix or use electric mixer; this tends to make the pie runny. Another tip - use normal size eggs. Extra large eggs will keep it from setting up. I shield the crust edges for the first 40 minutes, remove for the last 15 minutes. This keeps the crust from becoming too dark before pie is ready. One last thing, I bake mine exactly 55 minutes! No more, no less. I have found this is perfect for my oven which is calibrated correctly. I hope this helps.

This pie was delicious. Like most of us, I used 1/2 C each of light and dark corn syrup. However, my oven runs a little low so I baked this for more than an hour in all, and it was still barely set. To prevent the crust from getting too brown, fold strips of aluminum foil over the edges while the pie bakes. A reliable, tasty recipe.

I loved this pie. I followed the other reviews and used 1/2 cup dark corn syrup and 1/2 cup light corn syrup and everyone raved about it, and it was SO SIMPLE to make. This is a keeper for sure.

Note: I've made this numerous times now and I've noticed when I use 'large' sized eggs the center comes out very runny. So make sure you use regular sized eggs, or else it wont turn out in the middle.

YUM!  My husband said this was the best pecan pie he'd ever had!  I had to cook mine about 15min longer.  I also used 1/2 dark syrup and 1/2 light syrup.

The filling tasted good, but it was so soupy.  I'm not sure why it didn't set up.  It definitely baked long enough.

I've tried many different pecan pie recipes, but this is the one I've decided to stick to. I've baked it for the last 3 years and still like it as much as the first day (as my friends do). I usually add 1 tsp orange extract, 1/2 tsp rum extract and reduce pecans to 1 cup. The best one.

This is a good basic recipe for pecan pie - I've used it for years.  For the absolute best flavor, 1/4 cup dark corn syrup and 3/4 cup light corn syrup.  Also, I add about 1 tablesp of vanilla.  I received the ultimate southern compliment for my version "tastes better than grandma's"!

I made this for the first time and it got RAVE reviews!  It was so easy to make and the only thing I changed, based on another review, was added 1 TBSP. of vanilla.  I used 1-1/2 cups of pecans and thought that was plenty.  I covered just the edges of the pie crust for the first 45 minutes and then removed the foil and the crust browned nicely.  I also didn't remove it from the oven until the middle of the pie didn't "jiggle" anymore and it was perfect.  Will make another one today for my Dad's birthday party tomorrow.  My family LOVED it and wants more!

Awesome recipe!I make 4 of these every Thanksgiving! Use 1/2 cup light and 1/2 cup dark corn syrup. Also added 1 tablespoon of flour to mixture to help with the setting. To prevent your pie from burning, bake at 350 degrees for 50 mins with foil around crust, then remove foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Comes out PERFECT every time!

This came out really yummy! I just wish the directions had been a bit more clear for an unexperienced piemaker like myself - for example, I had to look up on google how to tell when it was ready to come out of the oven, and it took about 10 minutes longer than stated here. I also had too much filling for my pie crust - a deep dish pie plate would probably work best.

Outstanding recipe in every way. I thought it needed more Pecans so I added an extra 1/2-1c...this was a mistake, because they mostly float to the top, and too many means that some get dry and overcooked, so stick to the recipe, no need to add more. I will make this again, and next time make my own crust, this is far too good to be wasted on a lazy crust.

Used light corn syrup. This came out too sweet for us. Made two pecan pies for Christmas dinner, this one and another. The other one "won."  The difference may have been that I used light corn in this one and dark corn syrup in the other one. Liked the richness of the dark corn syrup better.

So, I registered on the site, just so that I could put a review for this absolutely delicious pecan pie!  This is probably the first thing that I have made that was finished so quickly!!  Personally, I thought that it was a little over-sweet and will take into account other reviews to split the corn syrup into light and dark....however, everyone loved it...and really, isn't that what matters!! Thanx for a great recipe!  This one will get alot of use!!

Best pecan pie recipe! I used pecan pieces instead of halves because you get more pecan in each bite, and it's easier to cut. My husband loved this! This is my new standard pecan pie recipe!

This pie is a hit every holiday! I have requests for this pie often and its so easy! I do add a little more pecans (1/2 cup) than the recipe calls for but either way, this one is delicous! Oh also, I use 1/2 dark and 1/2 light syrup for a rich color. Thanks for the recipe!

My family is a tough critic and pecan pie is my father's favorite. I really wanted this to turn out perfectly and it did! I used a short cut though. ;) I used a Pillsbury pie crust and it work beautifully.

This was very good. I had to cook mine in a cast iron pan to get it cooked all the way through.

This recipe is fantastic. I tweet it a bit adding 2 cups pecans instead of 1 and a half to make the pie more filling and 2 tablespoons bourbon! It's a household favorite around the holiday season!

My mother was the BEST pie maker EVER; with that being said, now that she is gone I could not locate her rececipe.  I came her to look for one that I thought was similar to her's and tried this Southern Pecan Pie I and read the reviews.  I took what was said and then some.  I made two of these for Thanksgiving...OMG I could not get enough!  I did use 1/2 light and 1/2 dark syrup AND then added just a few more pecans so that they were not floating so much and this WILL be my recipe from now on.  Thank you Nikki!

I added only a half cup of sugar and this was a perfect pecan pie.  Very similar to a recipe my husband's aunt gave me years ago but it only made an 8" pie.  This will be my pecan pie recipe from now on.

Delicious! All of my friends loved it. Very rich, though, and I would only recommend this to those whom have never made the comment "too sweet."

I made this as a gift for my son in law since he claims to be a pecan pie expert.  He LOVED it,  unfortunately for my daughter, since it is sooooo easy  she said he wants her to make it all the time.  The only thing I did different was the oven temp,  I preheated at 375 and then changed to 325 and back to 350 for last ten minutes,  but only because I did not want it to over brown before getting done since my oven tends to heat on the hot side, and not because the recipe itself was off.  I used a deep dish pie crust and it still filled it nicely,  I will definately make this many times over!

just like they all said, this was easy and DELICIOUS. i used the dark corn syrup (i was too lazy to buy both light & dark). I also used 2.5-3 Tbs butter -- again, too lazy to shave off some extra butter. ;-)

I am not talented with making pies, but this was terrific and came out perfect.  It was not as syrupy sweet as other pecan pie recipes, which made this one so good.  When I received a high compliment from an older, Southern woman, I knew this pie recipe was a hit!

Perfect pecan pie. The only thing I do different from what the directions have, is covered edges of crust with aluminum foil while baking so they don't get too browned. I've already made this twice and it's heaven each time!

After years of complaing about other people's pecan pie,  I made this recipe.  The wife said it was the best she ever had.  Be prepared for over spill in store bought crusts.

This pie is gone within the hour in my house. It's so easy and not to sweet. I do half white sugar and half brown sugar and it turns out really good not gooey like some other people who have commented on here. I will continue to use this recipe for a long time

Great Pecan Pie.  I've used this recipe several times now for holidays.  Only thing I do differently is to add about a Tbsp or two of blackstrap molasses.

I Love this pie, I would not change anything about it. This is the first pecan pie I have ever made, I will not be buying pecan pies anymore. Great Recipe. It takes more than an hour baking time for the filling to set just keep baking it and check to see when the middle does not jiggle very much, and cover the pie with foil so it won't burn the crust.

Super fast and easy to make pecan pie. I followed a few other reviewers and used half light and half dark syrup. I also used half brown sugar and half granulated sugar. This pie is so delicious that it’s going to be my go to pecan pie replacing my other more complicated pie recipe.

Super easy recipe to follow, but I had to reduce the amount of sugar. I try to eat healthy, but this recipe almost caused me to give up the healthy. :o) :o) :o)  My family and friends have enjoyed this recipe and my pecan pie with less sugar. I am amazed at just how easy this is to make.

Soooo delicious, and very simple to make. I would recommend putting a foil strip on your crust for the first 20 minutes.  Otherwise I stuck to the instructions and it turned out great.

Hubby wanted pecan pie for dessert on Easter, so I made this.  I used 3/4 cup of dark corn syrup and 1/4 cup of light corn syrup.  This pie was just as delicious as the pecan pie we had in South Carolina.   And with a scoop of vanilla ice cream---it was even better !!!   Excellent recipe

Didn't turn out as well as expected . . . The filling separated into a hard crunchy topping with a mushy filling underneath.

Great Pecan pie recipe, or so I was told.  I don't like pecan pie, but hubby does and he loved this.  My father'n'law thought it was pretty great too.  It was rich, but the people I served it too like rich.

Tasted very good...make sure you check your pie before time given .  My pie crust got burned .  Other than that pretty basic recipe, and does not take long at all.

I had not made a pecan pie before and needed to bring one to Thanksgiving. This went over like a rock star!  EVERYONE loved it from my sweet-tooth uncle to a friend who was visiting from China. It is the same recipe as the back of the Karo corn syrup bottle - except for the 15 at 400. I made mine in a spring form pan. Made it easier to cut and serve. Spray the pan first!

My husband made this pie for Thanksgiving, followed recipe exactly. Great Southern pecan pie taste, exactly what you would expect to get in Texas or something. The ooey gooey was a little runny but like I previously said my husband was cooking. First time I had seen him cook in like 5 years.

A few too many pecans for my taste.  I noticed as I was stirring the ingredients, that it is the exact same recipe as on the back of the Karo bottle, with an additional 1/2 cup of pecans.  So, next time, I'll leave out the additional 1/2 cup.  Also, if you use a frozen pie crust, as I did, make sure it's a deep dish.  I poured the filling into a regular pie shell and it overflowed everywhere.  Also, I used Splenda in place of white sugar and it cooked up and tasted fine.

Delicious! Delicious! Even good when you miss a few ingredients, substitute pecans if you'd like and it will still come out delicious. A great recipe. 

Just remember to let it sit for a few hours before cutting it, it will settle. 

Also, wait until the center does not jiggle before removing from the oven.

This recipe was AWESOME!  We hosted Christmas at our house this year...there were 3 pies served and this one was the only one that was gone by the end of the day.  Excellent taste...so easy to make!  I also used 1/2 light and 1/2 dark corn syrup.  Lots and lots of compliments!

I made this recipe for a church picnic and it was one of the first desserts to go.  My pastor said it was "excellent".  I liked how easy it was to put together.  I also used half dark and half light syrup, the result was a gooey, almost caramel like filling.  Excellent pie that I will make again and again!

I am in Germany and upon request my German friends asked me to make a pecan pie, saying it was their favorite "American" pie. I used this recipe and the results turned out fabulous! Everybody was drooling from one bite to the next. It was just fairly warm from cooling, but with discovery found that it was perfect for a cold Christmas Eve night. I also used light and dark syrup, which gave a nice blend of taste. Thank you so much!

This kind has sort of a cushion under the pecans, it's very sweet and didn't last long at my house!
Thanks for the recipe!

Simple recipe with great results. Didn’t add the salt and used half light/dark corn syrup.

This was the first pecan pie I ever made. Everyone who had a piece said it was great and that this recipe is a keeper!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using 1/2 light and 1/2 cup dark Karo syrup. I used medium eggs and let everything get to room temp as suggested by other reviews and it is perfect!

This is almost identical to my mother's recipe.  Her recipe called for 2 tbs. of flour.  Maybe that is why mine is not soupy.

As a Northerner, I was not raised on pecan pie.  But after 34 years of being married to a Southern man, and being adept at making homemade pies with crust from scratch, my hubby finally asked me to make a pecan pie--my very first in 64 years.  As suggested by a couple of others, I used half dark and half light Karo syrup.  Husband said he "liked it a lot" and "the sweetness level was fine".  Consistency was fine also, not soupy.    This is all from hubby--I didn't partake--I prefer fruit pies.

I have been making this pie for years. A few changes like other bakers I used dark and light corn syrup. And a 1/4 cup less sugar. I also chopped my pecans and made the crust by hand. Took about 40 min. Was well worth it!!

The light & dark syrup was a hit!  We served the pies at Thanksgiving and we no sooner had cut everyone a slice from all the offerings when one small sliver of pecan was left.  Lots of happy guests.  :)

I followed the directions to a T and, like some other reviewers, mine was all liquidy in the middle. It was pretty embarrassing when I cut into it in front of everyone at my Thanksgiving table and saw that it was a soupy mess in the middle. It tasted good but not a good presentation. Won't be making this recipe again. Feel like this recipe is missing a thickening agent like flour or cornstarch.

To keep it from being 'soupy', simply add 1 tablespoon of flour to get the filling to set...I also used 2 cups of whole pecans instead of 1.5....great standard recipe for pecan pie.

I don't like pecan pie but I made it for a funeral this week. My best friend's husband called and wanted to know why I had been keeping to myself all these years - it was the best pie he had ever had. It became 5 stars when I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar as well as 1/2 cup light Karo syrup and 1/2 cup dark Karo syrup. I even saw one guy pick up the pie tin and scrape the bottom. LOL! My husband and I think the secret is to keep cooking it until the center is completely jelled...no longer runny. Put aluminum foil around the pie shell edges so that does not burn.

The pie tasted fantastic, but it was a little runny. Next time, I will read the reviews on a recipe before trying, as I see others have already said the same thing. This was my very first homemade pie, so I thought I had done something wrong.

I followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately the pie did not set. Everyone said the flavor was great. It just needed to set. I did have to use large eggs because they had nothing smaller in the store. I was informed that it helps to get eggs up to room temperature first. I am going to try this again and perhaps take out a few table spoons of egg. Flavor fantastic, only issue was it not setting. I'll let you know how round two comes out!

How can anything that is so easy to make taste so good? I love this recipe. I also used 1/2 c. Light syrup and 1/2 c. Dark. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. I love it , I will make this on all special occasions.

I was told that it was the most delicious Pecan Pie my spouse ever tasted! The recipe was easy and foolproof. The only substitution I made was light brown sugar versus white sugar.

My favorite pecan pie recipe! Very good!! Make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas!
My only tip is don't mix too much and cover edges of pie crust so they don't over bake!!

This was my first pecan pie attempt and it was scrumptious!  The only change I made was I added more pecans and I toasted them first. Delicious and easy.

great recipe! i tried the half light, half dark syrup suggested in reviews. resulted in 'just right' sweetness. i used fresh pecans and chopped them. as in other reviews, when time is up, check for jiggle in the center. no jiggle, remove from oven. the times were good. would suggest covering the crust with strips of foil until the last 15 minutes. the pie came out wonderful!! will make this again!!  UPDATE: first used regular pie crust and it was full! need steady hands! so i tried a deep pie crust and i am going to have to make adjustments....same times as recipe except : cover entire pie loosely and bake another 10-15 min.  the times are good, but ovens are different, so just watch for the jiggle and cover if going over original time. will keep making until i run out of pecans in the yard!!!

Same recipe our Mom used for years until she was told to try using only 1/2 c. sugar instead of a cup.
It is was even better still plenty sweet but very delicious.  Our family how makes it with only 1/2 cup sugar, as we decided we like it much better that way!~~~

Oh...my...goodness this pie takes me back to my southern roots. I love the authentic southern taste. One thing I did different is not Brown it at first. I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes. And let it cool as recipe suggested it was delicious will definitely make again and again. And i'll have to do an extra mile on my walking trail. Lol

I made this pie a cpl times to rave reviews, although it wasn't quite as good as my grandmother's (she was a pie master).  
I specifically recall her using brown sugar so I substituted brown sugar, but this made the pie just too sweet. I decided to use both, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and the result was a home run!!! I've seen other reviews doing this with the corn syrup.....I may try this in the future, but then again why fix something that isn't broken ??
In addition, I brown/warm the pecans (I add an extra 1/2 cup) in a skillet on the stove top until the natural oils are released. This makes the house smell wonderful and gives the pie a rich, nuttier flavor!!!
It's still not quite my grandmother's, but is equally as delicuous. Everyone raves over this pie and always wants the recipe!!!

The pie came out AWESOME! I followed the directions to the letter. The only difference was, I left the pie in the oven after I turned it off. My granny always said it's better to let the pie cool in the oven. Then I took it out and let it rest for an hour or so. It's always a big hit at my church bake sale!

I've never made pecan pie before, but I know what i like.  And this recipe fit the bill very well.  The consistency was perfect, and the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness.  I will surely make it again.

I just baked this today. We couldn't wait and had a piece tonight. It tasted fine, nice, mild and not too sweet, however it did not bake completely within the 40 minutes at 350 after turning the heat down. The center 3 " seemed soggy and did not set. It puffed just fine and looked done. Perhaps it needed to bake at 375 instead or for 50 minutes. It makes a nice looking/tasting pie though. I will try it again and give it more time to bake and protect the crust edges earlier in the baking period.

Really enjoyed this classic pecan pie. Not too sweet and very easy to make, especially with a store bought crust!

This  is exactly what Southern Pecan Pie should taste like.  The recipe was so easy it took maybe 10 minutes to prepare.  I made it for my step-father for Thanksgiving and he loved it.

Every year around christmas I always look forward to my mothers pecan pie; however this is the first time I baked this pie on  my own. I am looking forward to sharing this recipe with others in the future. Thank you very much!!

I've made a lot of pecan pies in my life and this was so easy and set beautifully!  I also tried the 1/2 light and 1/2 dark corn syrup but I think I'll like it better with just light corn syrup.  Was a bit heavy.  Excellent!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I got tons of compliments on this pie.  The funny thing is that when I was pouring the corn syrup from the Karo bottle I noticed that the recipe is exactly the same!

This was awesome! I have never made a pie before, but I attempted this for my boyfriends birthday party and it turned out delicious. So easy to make, just mix it all and put in the oven. I doubled the recipe with no problem and used a ready to cook pastry crust. Loved it!

I thought everything was perfect about this recipe except that it should mention to bake on the lowest oven rack, or else the top would get brown too quickly. I started mine out on the middle rack, but moved it to the bottom when I noticed this. Also, I thought 1 1/2 cups of pecans wasn't enough. I used closer to 2 1/2 cups.

i JUST HAD TO ADD A REVIEW AFTER THE RAVE REVIEWS I GOT FROM THE PIE! mY HUSBAND TOOK ONE TO WORK AND HIS CO WORKERS SAID IT WAS THE BEST! I DO REC. THE DEEP DISH-I ALSO ADDED MORE PECANS AND PLACED PECAN HALVES AROUND THE EDGES JUST TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER PIES. I AM A BEGIINER AND THIS WAS SOOO EASY!

I have made this pie twice already and the reviews have been fantastic!!  It is delicious and not at all runny.  I suggest cooking it a few extra minutes, but otherwise I would not change a thing!  I will make this for year's to come!

I also used half light and half dark corn syrup.  The only thing I would do differently - and this is personal preference - is I would use smaller pieces of pecans rather than halves because it would be easier to cut and easier to eat.  Loved it!

The perfect pecan pie.  Easy to make and yummy! I used 1/2 light and 1/2 dark corn syrup and it seemed to be just right.  Everyone loved it. I wouldn't change a thing.

As usual I started making it only to discover ...I had no pecans!  So I subbed walnut and added some butter extract and some rum flavoring along with the vanilla, classic pecan pie texture and delish!

We love this recipe.  My first time making this pie.  Never liked pecan pie because too sweet.  But this one is just the right combination.  I made this for my husand and his coworker who were clamering for this pie since November.  I made it for the holidays and have had to make it again and again because they love it.  Easy and great tasting. Even I like it.
