Well, I didn't think anything was missing the first time I made it and loved it as written.  I used half sweet and half smoked paprikas the second time I made it, and it was good that way too. Use your judgement for your taste for this. Use good hungarian Paprike for this recipe.  Don't use something weak that has been sitting on your shelf for years...

I made this for the weekly recipe group selection. I followed everything as directed using my own homemade chicken broth. We've never had chicken paprika, so can't compare to any other recipe. The chicken was nice and tender, the sauce was very flavorful, I do buy my paprika at myspicesage.com, so some fresh good paprika. My husband really raved about it and said to make this one again.

Made this for Recipe Group...We LOVED this! Chicken Paprika is one of my hubby's favorite meals, so I knew this was gonna be a hit w/ him. I did lighten it up a bit, as we are trying to eat healthier...I used whole wheat flour in place of regular for dredging, sprayed my pan w/ olive oil cooking spray instead of using oil and reduced the amount of sour cream by more than 1/2 and used light sour cream. This still provided the richness/creaminess w/o all the extra fat/calories. I served this over Ronzoni Smart Taste egg noodles (this was our first time trying them and they were FANTASTIC, BTW!). This was super simple to make and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made for Recipe Group. As my MIL is Hungarian, I have been making Chicken Paprikas for years. This I thought is a good quick substitute for it. Tasted pretty good to me, hubby thought it needed something, but didn't know what. I think he just wanted more gravy! I served with homemade spaetzle. Thanks for the recipe!

October 11, 2014 Allrecipes Buzz Recipe Group recipe selection - I made half of this recipe and while we liked it, we felt it was somewhat bland and just lacked something.  This is an easy dish to prepare, comes together quickly and produces very tender bites of chicken. I followed the recipe except I used my own homemade chicken broth and Hungarian Paprika. I served this over Basmati rice. To create a more appetizing appearance, I topped each individual serving with chopped fresh green and red bell peppers. The addition of the peppers also enhanced the taste.   Thanks, Khall88 for sharing your recipe!

Recipe Group Selection for October 11, 2014 -  My daughter and I thought this was delicious, but my husband thought it was just adequate, thus the four star rating.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was a very nice dish, and recommend it.  It really is yummy.

Well- I made it per the recipe and the chicken was really tender and sauce creamy BUT the paprika flavor was all it seemed to have. I know! It is called Chicken Paprika but I was expecting some more depth and maybe a more complex flavor. Maybe if I used sweet along with smoky it would be more to my tastes. I think if you really like paprika your enjoy this.

This was off the hook,,,next time I will use chicken thighs boneless. Great flavor,,,even my picky 6 year old ate it up. I will definitely keep this in rotation. I even forgot to flour the chicken so I just sprinkled flour over it while it was in the pan, still came out screamin. Thanks for this gem!!!!

Very tasty.  I added one chopped green pepper to the onion for some extra veggies and served it with white rice.  I found that it reheated well in the microwave.  Also a good way to use up extra sour cream!

Recipe Group Selection:  11, October 2014 ~ LOVED this dish!  I prepared a half batch of this recipe using 1# of chicken breast.  It was plenty to feed the two of us with leftovers.  Because we love the taste of cooked onions, I didn't measure it, I just used the entire onion.  I used half regular paprika and half hot paprika. We both thoroughly enjoyed the taste of this recipe.  I served mine over acorn squash and my DH's over a baked Yukon Gold potato.  Nice and creamy and rich with flavor.  Definitely will be making this one again.  Thanks Khall88, for sharing your recipe.  I served this with 'Sylvia's Easy Greek Salad' an AR recipe.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I added a little Tajin for what we thought was missing flavor at the end.  I did make two other changes----I used catsup rather than tomato paste, and I didn't use any cornstarch.  I served this over pasta.  This was a good meal.  Thanks, Khall88!

This was easy and delicious. I didn't have any onions, as my son took the last one I had, so I used shallots and also added hot pepper flakes as we like it zippy! Thanks for the recipe.

This was really tasty, although I would spice it up a bit with goulash cream and hot paprika.  It also works well with beef.

i had some mushrooms that needed to be used up so I added those.  Used 3 kinds of paprika:  Hungarian, Spanish sweet, and just a little bit of smoked for a tad more depth of flavor.  (a little bit of smoked paprika goes a long way.)  I salted along the way.  I also used season salt in my flour mixture.  It still needs 'something' but what, I'm not sure.  maybe a dash of worstershire?  not sure.  It's definitely rich and filling.  I don't think I'd use the cornstarch next time.  the sauce thickened nicely and I even added a bit more stock to thin it out some.

My family loved it. The only change I made was instead of coating the chicken in a shallow dish, I put the flour covering into a bag to shake to coat. So easy!!

Tastes ok but we both found it a tad bland and in need of salt. Easy to prepare and was filling overall.

I made this tonight and the kids loved it! I tweaked it to suit our taste buds. I added a a ton of cayenne pepper and it came out just perfect. It wasn't overwhelming. The only thing I would substitute is the sour cream with cream cheese instead. Im just not a big fan of sour cream. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Recipe Group: I scaled this to 3 servings and followed the recipe pretty close. I did shake the chicken pieces in a bag with the flour coating instead of dredging them. The only other change I made was to the cook time; DBF was an hour later than I was expecting, so step 4 was more like half an hour :) Very rich and delicious. I served over egg noodles with parsley and poppy seeds. Never had chicken paprika before, but this will go in the rotation, easy and pretty economical, thanks for sharing the recipe!

When made exactly as written, it's delicious.  We've also tinkered a little bit by reducing the sour cream and/or adding vegetables like carrots or mushrooms.  It's a great recipe!

12 22 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/230737/chicken-paprika/ ... 'Found a discrepancy & went with the lower amount since a complaint said, basically, it screamed "Paprika!"  Well, it is paprika chicken - or chicken paprika.  ;D  Here's how it went for me:  2ts salt, 1/8t black pepper.  In list, 1T, in directions, for sauce, 1t.  I went with 1t.  I subbed 2T ketchup as another reviewer did.  Also added 1/2t each: lime juice, cayenne pepper & liquid smoke; sprinkle of oregano.   A hit of curry may be a good addition.  Girl liked before the sour cream sauce.  She isn't the creamy sauce type girl.  Boy liked, wouldn't mind seeing again.  We'll see.  Very tender.  Glad I tried.

I added red peppers and carrots when sautéing the onions and garlic so there were some veggies in the dish. I deglazed the pan with red wine after adding the veggies and chicken, before the chicken stock and tomato paste. For additional flavour I added some hot chilli powder and Worcester sauce. My gang really like it.

Made this for recipe group. Instead of cutting the chicken into little pieces I cut the breasts in half. It was very good. I used bouillon in place of the stock. I thought the dish had great flavor.
