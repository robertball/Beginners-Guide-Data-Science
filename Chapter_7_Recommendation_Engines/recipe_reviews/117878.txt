I stumbled upon this recipe when I was trying to find a simple *weeknight meal* way to use up some bell peppers I had on the verge of going bad.  I really enjoyed it!  Mr. LTH hasn't eaten yet, so I've yet to get his input, but I'd make/eat this again.   I didn't measure any of the produce and I used green, red, yellow, and orange peppers.  Per personal preference, I did not use olives.  The only *major* change I made was to substitute chicken broth for water.  I read the recipe 4 times to make sure I was reading it right, but I just couldn't see wasting any flavor by using water, so I made an executive decision to sub chicken broth.  I ate some w/both crumbled feta & goat and some w/fresh shredded fontinella and can't decide which way I liked better:  the feta/goat made almost a cream coating that was nice, but I think I preferred the flavor of the fontinella.  Any cheese would work w/this, per your personal preference.  TY for a fantastic way to use up the bell peppers I can't seem to resist buying!

It was easy to make and looked pretty. However, it lacked a little in flavour. Maybe adding some lemon juices and/or zest and some more herbs, like basil, for instance, would pick it up a bit.

I swear, you can cook up some pasta and add just about anything to it and it's going to be awesome good, just as this was.  The red and green bell peppers contribute great flavor as well as making it especially colorful and pretty. Because of the black olives and oregano it almost tastes reminiscent of a pizza.  I didn't add the feta - I do like it, but it just didn't appeal to me here.  I served this with Cajun Shrimp, but as far as I'm concerned this would be a fitting side dish for whatever meat you put on the plate.

I would give this a 3.5 if I could.  It was really easy, relatively healthy, and good, but just a little plain/bland.  I'm not complaining, everything got eaten, but it wasn't a wow dish.  I added an extra cup of bell peppers doubled the olives, and added dried basil and Italian seasoning in addition to the oregano.  I would make this again for a quick weeknight meal since I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

Even my boyfriend (a major carnivore) loves this!  It has worked it's way into our regular menu.  I think it'd also be good with grilled chicken.  I tried another noodle but I think penne is best.  Also, I don't use any water with the peppers so they are crisper and I don't like feta so I use an Italian cheese blend.

Wonderful flavor combination.  The timing on everything was just right,the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  I added zucchini to mine and topped with parmesan cheese since I didn't have any feta cheese onhand.  My family ate it all, even the kids loved it!

I really don't know what to rate this recipe.  I followed it except for using dry white wine rather than water.  I also topped individual servings with the feta cheese rather than adding it to the entire dish.  It was very easy to make and didn't taste bad, was OK, good but nothing spectacular.  I would probably make it again as it does work well for a summer veggie meal served with additional veggies on the side.

My boyfriend and I both thought this was a great recipe.  Perfect for cleaning out the fridge last night.  We did make a few changes:  We didn't use olives, or red peppers as we didn't have any.  Instead I chopped up a tomato and put it in at the same time as the water.  We also dissolved a little bit of chicken bouillon in the water to give it some more flavor.  We used a mediterranean flavored feta, and it was so good.  Also added some dried basil with the other spices.  Then we threw in some grilled chicken.  Very versatile recipe.  Thanks!!

Great low-cal recipe!  I used green olives (instead of the black it shows in the picture) and it turned out great.

I followed recipe almost exactly(adding just 1 tsp chicken base to water)
and I agree with some of the other reviews. Its just a little bland for my taste. I was also thinking the sauce would turn out a bit more creamy than it did. perhaps less water is needed and a little more feta!?
Overall it was simple to make

Added italian sausage for protein and used mixed olive bruschetta for more flavor instead of just regular olives.  Used the following fresh herbs generously: oregano, italian parsley, & basil.  And used crushed pepper since I had no cayenne pepper in the house.  Very quick and easy recipe.  Next time will try with chicken.

This was a quick, easy and colourful dish which my daughter loved. You can't ask for much more than that. The cayenne pepper was what made this special for her. She told me you can make this again soon. Thanks.

My goal for the year is to make more meatless dishes -and this one went over well with me and my fiance! Unfortunately, I didn't have all the ingredients mentioned, and my fiance and I don't like olives, so I didn't add them.  I quite enjoyed the modifications I made, and I bet the dish is even better in its original form!  Here are my modifications:  2c green pepper instead of 1c red, 1c green no olives added more oregano added basil added more water used shell pasta instead of penne colby jack and cheddar cheese instead of feta

It wasn't terrible, but I thought the pepper overwhelmed the recipe.  I really couldn't taste anything else.  Maybe if you are a fan of peppers, this would be for you.

Delicious. We added some sweet pepper sausage, as we like meat in our pasta, and mushrooms as well, and also omitted the olives. Definitely will make this again!

A little bland for my taste as written but a great base recipe. Added some lemon juice, mushrooms, parmesan, fresh herbs (basil, lovage, and dill). I used the pasta water after boiling it. I also added some cooked shrimp to fill up my man :) I would have added white wine if I had any on hand. A very nice use for those cute little sweet peppers that come in a bag.

Made exactly as the recipe was written and loved this dish.  Simple yet tasty.  Will be making again!  

Had to mention that I was looking forward to the leftovers today (made this last night) and my husband liked it so much he took all the leftovers to work.

I followed this recipe exactly except for the feta because I didn't have any in the house and found it a little bland.  I used green olives and they were so yummy in it though. Next time I will up the amount of olives and add more cayenne and garlic and make sure I have some feta.

Great dish!  Probably a 4.5 because it's healthy too.  I used chicken and mushrooms also.  Next time I will try sundried tomatoes or zucchini per other reviews.  Definitely a keeper!

After trying this, I thought the dish needed something extra, so I added eggplant. Turned out great.

YUM! I made this as a side dish to our bbq rib dinner last night. A few changes were that only I used 3 types of peppers, colors, red, yellow and orange, for color, and we had extra in the refrig. The amount was more like 2 and a half cups peppers, and also used a red onion for additional color. It was easy to prepare and rave reviews by guests! A keeper formy family folder of yummy side dishes! Heck I bet if you add some left over italian sausage it would make a great dinner or lunch the next day.

*******superb!  My fiance and I like things spicy, so we added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  The olives and feta made this dish an explosion of flavour in your mouth!  My fiance is Italian and very big on pasta, so this passed his test!  Yay!!! P.S.  It is a very quick dish to prepare:)

Fantastic recipe. I would serve in a large bowl with the pasta on the bottom and peppers on top to get a better mixing effect.

Good stuff! I followed everything exactly, however I did use rotini pasta, as that is what was on hand. Oh, and I used a bit more cayenne pepper, and omitted the salt (love spice, hate salt). Great recipe, thank you.

Awesome recipe!  I made this toight exactly like it says except that I added a handful of grape tomatoes at the end.  Absolutely delicious.  Nice way to squeeze in veggies!  My 7 and 9 year old asked for seconds.  It's a keeper!

Good pasta dish.  It's not my favorite pasta dish, but definitely tasty.  It seemed to need a little something extra, so I the only change I made was to add red pepper flakes.

I was surprised at how easy and tasty this dish is. I used whole grain penne pasta and my husband just loved it (and he's not a big pasta fan)!

Yuck, maybe I did somthing wrong, but it tasted awful, the olives, maybe since I used green instead...
