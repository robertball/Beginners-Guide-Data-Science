Love it, love it love it.  Seasoned italian bread crumbs are wonderful, I just added 1 tsp each of garlic powder and italian seasoning. I browned them olive oil 2 minutes on each side, then placed them on a roasting rack in the oven to finish.  It was much less greasy and the rack allowed both sides to remain crispy.

I love these, the method was the most useful thing. I dipped in the egg wash and batter twice. My husband loves these.
I beat the heck out of my chops first, so I only get about 3 to a large skillet. I was very happy with this. I also coat the raw plain chops with a flour salt pepper mix then the egg wash then bread crumb mixture. The flour binds with the egg to keep the breading on a bit better. I learned this from a breaded chicken recipe and it works.

EXCELLENT!! I've never been able to make good pork chops, but now I have a great recipe to fall back on.  I followed some of the other suggestions about cutting back on the bread crumbs/egg mixtures and also dredged the chops in flour mixed with salt and pepper before dunking in eggs and bread crumbs.  Also, if you do not know if your skillet is ovenproof, you can double wrap the handle in aluminum foil in order to make it ovenproof.

As suggested by others, I dredged the pork chops in flour before dunking  them in the egg mixture, which I cut to just 1 egg and a couple tablespoons of milk. Also, I put the bread crumbs and  cheese in a zip top baggie and then did a shake 'n bake type thing. I find it coats the chops better. My husband and I both fully enjoyed these pork chops. They were very easy to make and very moist.

I've always made my pork chops this way-lots of flavor and very tender.   However, if you have left-over egg mixture...add the left-over bread crumb mixture to it and cook it in the frying pan after the chops are done. When mixing the two together, you need a slightly pourable consistency, so adjust accordingly, more milk or more bread crumbs as needed.  Once it's in the pan, just spread it out a bit with your spatula. Let it cook for a few minutes and then, using your spatula, cut it into 'pie wedges' and flip over and finish cooking till it's lightly browned.  Serve it on the platter with your chops.    My mom and her mom before her never wasted anything. My 6 brothers and sisters and I grew up loving it, as did my 4 children and their friends.  Just a nice little side dish, especially if you don't have a lot of meat to go around. Mom just called it 'egg and cracker'. (...and yes, I'm sure it's probably not the healthiest side dish, just thought I'd offer it up as an alternative to dumping it all down the sink)

I used 1 inch thick pork chops and increased the oven temp to 375. I bypassed the skillet altogether, and baked the chops on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes. Perfect every time. I use this same method for oven fried chicken. No oil required and use Egg Beaters instead of eggs. I also dredged the chops in flour then egg then breadcrumbs. I also added fresh parsley instead of green dried confetti. You can also substitute Italian breadcrumbs for panko and it makes for extra crispy crust.

I never breaded my pork chops before but since husband came along, he loves them that way so this was my attempt.  These came out just as advertised but I should have read more of the reviews and went with 1 less egg and half of the bread crumbs (although it did make it quick and easy to bread with all of those crumbs!)  I did transfer to a glass casserole for baking and easy table presentation.  Might add ground rosemary next time.  The 2 T. olive oil probably could have been 3-4 T.  They did come out looking picture perfect though and hub must've complimented them more than anything else I've made (and I cook a lot).  Thanks for the really easy recipe to get all that praise for!

Terriffic recipe!  My husband loved it too, and he's a picky eater.  However, I substituted SLICED garlic for the chopped, because it's easier to remove from the oil, rather than trying to retrieve a bunch of little garlic pieces from hot oil!  Also, I added a teaspoon of italian seasoning blend to the milk/egg mixture.  I will DEFINATELY use this recipe on a regular basis!  THANK YOU!

These are the best!  I add a little garlic powder to my italian bread crumbs and double dip my pork chops for a thicker coating.  I don't have an oven proof skillet, so I just transfer the pork chops to a baking dish.

DELICIOUS!!! I loved them. I thought they were absolutely wonderful. What a nice change. BUT...the next time I make them, which will be soon, I will make a few more adjustments, because, per other reviews, I used (1) less egg, but it was still too much. I used (1/2) cup less bread crumbs, but that was still too much. I doubled the olive oil to (4) tablespoons, used crushed garlic, which I left in the pan when I added the pork chops. When done, they were a little greasy, however, I let them sit on paper towels before serving. Yum Yum.

At a total loss for what to do with the porkchops I had taken out of the freezer, I found this recipe.  I had everything in the house and threw it together in no time, and to boot, it was very tasty!  I would definitly do it again.  I agree with another review, however, that the egg mixture was way too much.  I could have made half the amount and it would have been plenty.

This was really good, of course I seasoned the pork chops before breading, and they came out sooo delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent, quick and easy recipe. Pork chops are moist and tender inside while crisp and crunchy outside.  I make them slightly differently to keep the breading on the pork chops and nicely browned. 1.) Use Nature seasoning salt on the chops, for flavor, 2.) key to keeping breading on the chops, dredge in flour, light coat,  dunk in egg wash, coat with breadcrumbs, let coating setup for 15 minutes before frying 3.) follow the rest of the recipe until cooking.  4.) Brown outside in oil covered fry pan med-high to medium, sizzling but not splashing, it takes about 1 minute per side lifting the chop with tongs occasionally to let oil under the chop.  4.) After browning set chops onto nonstick baking sheet then put into oven at 375F convection bake mode for 15 minutes turning chops over, halfway. 5.) Let rest on platter, uncovered for 5 minutes. They always come out perfect, I should take pictures sometime.  Family loves this recipe.

I'm the author of this recipe and I just love that it has been enjoyed by so many of you out there! As I look at the recipe (after submitting it so many years ago) I see that there is room for improvement as many of you have noticed. My family rarely measured anything when they cooked, so I guesstimated when I originally wrote this recipe. Using only ONE egg, ONE tablespoon of milk, and equal amounts of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese-about 2/3 cup each, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried parsley would be great for starters. Also, I realize now that I was trying my best to get the most flavor from the garlic by chopping it, but I was always taught to smash the garlic clove to get the skin off. If you're smashing the garlic (carefully with the bottom of a glass or by using a chef's knife laid flat on the clove), that should open up the clove enough to allow the skin to easily come off and open the clove so the oils will infuse the olive oil. Lastly, quality makes a HUGE difference in any recipe you make. Powdered cheese vs. freshly grated parmesan, fresh vs. powdered garlic -need I say more? The thickness of your chops needs to be considered as well when you're cooking. If they are thin cutlets, you may not need to put them in the oven at all. I always use a meat thermometer (the kind that has a probe with a cord and digital screen) so there is no guessing when your meat is done. This recipe is delicious because it is so simple-keep it that way.

I am so happy to see that this recipe was submitted! I too, am from a Sicilian family and these pork chops were a staple in our family and now in mine.  The only change that we make is to add about 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder to the bread crumbs and my Nana always browned them in vegetable oil.  I use half olive oil and half vegetable oil, just to get the pan hot enough to brown the chops evenly.  My addition over the years is to place the browned chops onto cookie cooling racks sprayed with non-stick spray, and then arranged on a cookie sheet.  It keeps the chops crispy.  I allow them to sit a few minutes before serving, and the breading crisps up even more.  Over the years, for my husband's family, I've made an American version.  I substitute plain bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper; in place of the milk, I beat the eggs with a few tablespoons of creamy Ranch Dressing, and then follow the rest of the recipe.  Thank you so much ELISAW, for a nice walk down memory lane!

Fantastic recipe. Just the same a my late(wonderful) Mother-in Law made them. She, too was Sicilian. These are wonderful when served with home-made (a New England thing) applesauce.

I try not to indulge in "fried" foods often, but am so glad I tried this as it had intrigued me for quite some time.  Followed the recipe exactly (why wouldn't you, when rating it?) and it was delightful.  5 stars for a recipe that has joined my list of favorites!  Thank you Elisaw for the posting!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to leave the garlic in the saucepan while I browned the pork chops instead of reserving it for another use. I found the flavor of the garlic encrusted on the pork chops absolutely mouth-watering as did the rest of my company. Thanks for sharing such a great and easy recipe with us! Looking forward to making this recipe again as it has now become a regular request at our house.

YUM. These turned out really well. I really enjoyed the flavor. However, I will say that I did not even put them in the skillet, I just threw them in a baking dish and cooked them that way. I was in a rush and I dont like too many cooking steps. It turned out very nice just baking.

Great pork chops!  I used thin boneless pork chops and followed the recipe as written except for changing the cook time.  After browing for about 3 minutes on each side I put them in the oven for about 5-6 minutes and they were perfect.  These were a hit with the entire family!  I served them with a quick risotto and green peas.

had no problem with just using egg (no milk) and estimated the bread crumbs. I didn't need to cook them in the oven, I thought the key to these were to NOT turn them often in the pan, just once per side. VERY YUMMY

These were so good I thought my heart was going to stop. I did cut back on the bread crumbs to 1C. and 1/4C. on the parm cheese. I still had a lot of crumbs left over using 6 pork chops. Next time I will use 3/4C. crumbs and 1/4C. of the cheese. I did dredge them in flour BEFORE the egg wash. I also added a bit of black pepper and seasoning salt to the bread crumbs.  They were cooked perfectly, not dry at all. YUMMY!

GREAT! My pork came out so tender and flavorful. I was surprised such a simple recipe with such few ingredients could be so good. The changes I made: doubled the amount of olive oil and left the garlic in the oil. I didn't have an ovenproof skillet so I transferred the pork to a glass dish and poured the oil in over the chops.

The breading was good and the pork chop stayed moist. However, I found that it was too greasy and didn't stay crisp. I halved the breading and it was still way too much! Will try again though...

My father's side of the family is also Sicilian and they make this same recipe with round steak in place of the pork chops.  My dad uses equal part bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, plus a little salt and pepper.  He also adds the garlic to the bread crumbs (I wouldn't mess with putting them in the oil).  You need to use either very thin sliced round steak or pound the round steak thin with a mallet.  I marinate the steaks in milk for the day, to tenderize them.  These steaks go great with stuffed artichokes, which use the same breading for their stuffing!

Only thing I changed in this recipe was the breading process: egg, flour, egg again and then crumbs only because this is how I've always done breading and it has always yielded very crispy results.  It was delicious, crispy & juicy.  Will definitely make again!

I lightly seasoned 6 thinly sliced pork loin chops with garlic salt and pepper for about 1 hour before flouring. I then egg washed and laid the chops onto italian panko bread crumbs (the only kind I had). Because my chops were basically cooked through after frying, I finished them in a foil-covered baking dish in the oven at 250F for an hour. HERE'S A TIP: Use a two-prong fork (instead of tongs) to fry breaded meats (chicken, veal, pork, etc.); it minimizes breading loss when handling/turning the meat. ANOTHER TIP: Limit pushing or sliding the breaded meat in the skillet. The oil should prevent sticking if the heat is not hotter than medium, which brings me to YET ANOTHER TIP: Don't get impatient and turn up the heat. Keep it at medium or low-medium heat to get the best golden-brown breading that won't stick to the skillet!

Was good, but needed a little something.  Maybe more salt and pepper?  I also think I could have messed up the recipe!  (I'm good at doing that).

These were done to perfection.  The recipe was "spot on" and I didn't have to add or change a thing!  Thank you for posting.  Will make this again as it was a big hit.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans!

I've made this a few times and it came out amazing!!! I agree that the amount of egg and bread mixture is too much for the number of pork chops. I used one less egg and cut the breading mixture by about a third. I also tried using more pork chops, smaller boneless pork loin chops. Another variation, try it with chicken. I tried chicken tenders and they were great!!!

The only change I did was to season the pork chops with s/p, parsley flakes and garlic powder before coating to give an extra depth of flavor.  I also double-dipped mine for an extra thick coating.  I recommend you do the same to enjoy all the flavors going on!

This is probably my new favorite pork chop recipe! I made a few minor changes based on the previous reviews. I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs on hand so I used plain but added 2 tbsp of Italian seasoning. I only used 2 eggs and that was plenty! I will probably only use 1 cup of bread crumbs next time because I had so much left over. I heated the garlic on a skillet and decided to mix it in with the egg mix. I breaded the chops and baked them in the oven without putting them in the skillet. I cooked them for 30 min at 375 but I'll probably make it more like 25-28 minutes because they were a tad dry around the edges. They were sooooo flavorful! I will use this often!!!

Ok this is my new favorite way to prepare pork! I've already made it 3 times...It is absolutely delicious and easy for the novice cook like me ;) My boyfriend loved it too, which says a lot because he is very picky! I added extra garlic and parmesan and cut the parsley (personal preference). It paired great with mashed potatoes & corn and was even better re-heated the next day! Thank you.

This is a good recipe overall.  Easy to cook and tastes great.  We substituted minced garlic in the oil and added some garlic and onion powder in with the bread crumbs.  The recipe does call for too much breadcrumb mixture.  We had about half left over.

I have tried this and it makes for a great way to get the "Fried highlights" without the grease!Delicious!!...I also want to add that I always refrigerate my coated chops (or chicken which I always do)for at least one hour or at least a good 30 minutes or more as it is 'magic' the way the coating remains on all the meat and doesn't end up with alot of it at all if any,IN the pan~~Just the least I could add to this great dish!!MANGIA!!!!!

I used an old iron skillet (about 10 inches across) and seasoned it well with coconut oil before adding the chops for browning.

The chops baked up beautifully and evenly cooked, and the flavor was superb.  I would not hesitate to make these chops in large quantities for a family event or a holiday meal.  They are that good.

I used top loin pork chops from Costco as they are cut nearly one inch thick.

These were great! My husband loves Italian Pork Chops from a local italian restaurant here in Vegas and these were even better. Next time I am going to dip them in flour first, since that helps keep the breading from falling off, which it did just a tiny bit. These were moist and very flavorful.  I served them with the Alla Checca recipe on this site and it was a wonderful meal. A keeper!

This was a HUGE hit at my house tonight.  I used 10 boneless chops  & still had  plenty of crumb mixture using the amounts as listed. After browning, I placed the chops  in a roasting pan on a rack to finish in the oven.  This kept the wonderful breading in tact.  Perfect!  Great flavor and tender chops.  I'll be making these often.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I made this for my husband tonight and we both loved it.  The breading was so flavorful.  I hate soggy breading so to prevent this I removed the pork chops from the skillet and baked them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet.  The only thing is that there was way to much of the bread crumb mixture so I'll cut in half next time.  They were wonderful!

This recipe is awesome.  Also works great if you use extra thin slices of pork tenderloin (sold as escalope here in Spain), just omit the oven part, as the meat cooks in less than the time it takes to brown both sides!

These were great!  So moist, tender and flavorful.  I didn't have an ovenproof skillet, so I transfered them to a glass baking dish after browning.  I increased the oven to 350 because my pork chops were super thick, about one inch.  I was suprised how tender these turned out!  I made 3 chops and used only one egg, and cut the breading/cheese in half, and I still had some leftover.  I don't have any dried parsley, so I used dried basil instead.  The whole family loved these, even my 4 year old!

These were good.  I did use more spices added to the breadcrumbs so that I could have a bit more flavor to the dish.  I also added stuffing to the mix.  I did stuff these pork chops with just some regular stove top stuffing.  Needed more to the dish.  They turned out great.  Also, added a little less parmesean cheese and small splash of white wine to the olive oil when placing in the oven.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe....I added some  crushed red pepper for some zing.  I don't know about anyone else, but I'd start with half of this recipe.  I breaded 6 fairly thick and large boneless pork chops and threw quite a bit away.  Food is way too expensive to waste and I prefer my Parmesan to taste fresh, not stale.  It's easy enough to make more should you need it.  :)

These pork chops are prolly the best I have ever had, and they're so easy to make! If you don't have a skillet big enough to bake them in, just brown your pork chops like they say, then place them in a 9X13 pan along with the juices and some extra olive oil and they'll turn out just fine! :-)

These are very moist! I don't have a skillet that goes in the oven, so I stick a cookie sheet in the heated oven while the chops are browning and transfer them from skillet to pan. I've made no other variations. The cooking times are perfect, by the way! I'm sure we'll be having these again very soon!

My wife and I normally don't particularly like pork chops, but this recipe was great. I skipped parsley and chopped in some fresh basil because I had it on hand. Very delicious!

Delicious!!! Just a few issues... wayy to many eggs and bread crumbs called for in the recipe.  I would cut it in half, because I ended up throwing it away! I also left the garlic in the pan.  Also when you cook the pork chops on medium heat, DO NOT turn it up I did after I cooked a couple for the first time and they burned! So, cook medium heat on each side for 5 minutes like stated.  Overall really yummy and my family enjoyed!

these pork chops were delicious! I marinated these chops in Italian dressing for a few hours before cooking and the flavor was amazing! 

as per another reviewer I also put the chops on a rack in the oven to keep both sides crispy. I will definitely make these again!

Delicious & juicy.  Use less egg and less crumbs.

I was not that impressed with these pork chops. First thing is that there was a lot of left over egg mixture and breading mixture. If I were to make it again, I would cut that almost in half. I did flour the chops to ensure the breading stuck and that was helpful. Secondly, the pork was really dry; perhaps I should've only cooked it for 10-15 minutes and then checked the temperature. It also would've been better with a sauce of some sort.

This was a HUGE hit in my house, even with my 5 yr. old wh has recently "removed pork from her menu." lol! I dredge in flour first like others mentioned, then egg, then repeated that before coating with breadcrumb mixture. I agree that the original recipe did call for too much egg and breadcrumb mix. I will remember that next time. I did not have an oven-proof pan so I baked in glass dish turning them over halfway through to ensure crispiness on both sides. My only complaint is that the breading didn't stay on the meat when cutting into it... which could easily b operator error. :))

EXCELLENT!!! I can't speak highly enough of this recipe. Everyone loved it from the 3yr old to the 35yr old. I think that dredging through the flour first, as suggested by other reviews, is key. Also, I didn't have an oven safe skillet so I just put them in a glass casserole dish after browning. Yummy!!!

I would rate these 4-1/2 if I could.  They were easy to make and it used ingredients I always have on hand.  Browning them in the pan first really gave them a nice crispy coating and left me with a moist juicy porkchop.  Much more flavorful than just regular seasoned breadcrumbs.  I also dusted them in flour before the eggwash and added about 1 tsp of garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture.  I only browned them about 3 minutes per side until they were nicely browned and they finished cooking in about 18 minutes in the oven. These reheated great the next day for lunch by putting them in the toaster oven for about 3 minutes per side. (Don't use a microwave to reheat - they will dry out and the crust will get soggy).

These are really good, especially with a squish of lemon on them.  One thing is I would cut down on the amount of ingredients you use for the breading; there's way too much.  More than you need, and most will end up in the garbage.  I will probably cut down on the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese by half, and the eggs you only need two...and skip the milk.  It's unnecessary.  You can also still put them in the oven if you don't have an oven-proof skillet, just put the pork chops on a baking sheet with a rack so they stay crispy.  Some other reviewers didn't see the point of removing the garlic from the oil, but it's so it won't burn.  Garlic burns easily and tastes really bitter if it does, and while it was obnoxious to try and remove the chopped garlic from the oil, you could just crush four cloves and then removed them from the oil when they've imparted their flavor.  All in all, great recipe.

This made good pork chops, but it made AMAZING chicken. As other reviewers, I dredged first in flour, then double-breaded (egg then crumbs, egg then crumbs). Made a few chops and chicken breast halves simultaneously, pan-frying and baking in the same dish for the same amount of time. The pork was good, but the chicken was incredibly tender - a great surprise.

To give this dish a 5 star read the reviews first!!.  The ingredients need to be cut in half or less before you begin.  I did not use fresh garlic, instead I used a garlic olive oil.   Since I did not find my parsley I used Rosemary instead but any herb with an italian flare to it would work. I sprayed pam on a glass pan and transferred the chops out of the fry pan as well.  I was worried about the baking without a cover or foil but it worked wonderfully just as the recipe stated.  They are tasty and moist.  My husband and teenager both were happily surprised.

Made these 2 nights ago for dinner and dh just told me in the car today how much he enjoyed them and wants me to make them again.  I cut the eggs down to 2 and then dipped the chops twice to double coat the breadcrumbs.  I also cut the amount of breadcrumbs down to 1 cup and added some garlic powder.  They were great!

My whole family loved these!  The pork is so tender and juicy, and the flavor was wonderful.  I don't have an oven proof skillet, so after browning the chops, I slid everything into a glass baking dish.  Worked great!

In my humble opinion,the only step missing from this recipe is a brining. Brining is the only way to go for moist, alarmingly tender pork with some flavor to boo Also? Always bone in chops. The bone adds flavor.

Very good, I made 2 chops, so halved the recipe. I lightly floured and seasoned (salt&pepper) pork b4 the egg dip, this way the breadcrumbs stuck better. Like others, I used half the amount of breadcrumbs and 1 egg. They turned out just like those in the picture! I baked at 350 the first time I made them and they were slightly overdone. The next time I made them I  baked at 325 using my oven proof skillet and they turned out perfect, tender on the inside, crispy on the outside and tasted delicious!

Love it.  Been using it weekly for 6 months or more.  I usually have 3 chops as I'm a single dad with 2 boys, and thus I make a batch of batter and keep it in the freezer between uses (it lasts through several), and only use 1 egg and 1 tbsp milk per use as with 3 chops that is sufficient.  Great recipe!

YUM! This came out delish! I used a cast iron skillet, made sure to use pork chops WITH the bone, and added the flour before the egg/bread crumbs. I also added extra seasonings (garlic salt, parsley, thyme - like 2 pinches of each). I made sure to use Italian style breadcrumbs (not plain). They came out crispy outside and moist inside.... and flavorful all around.

We thought this was great!  Per the advice of previous reviews, I only used 2 eggs...and still had a ton leftover...next time I will only use 1 large egg.  I don't use pre-seasoned breadcrumbs because of all the additives, so Instead I combined 1 1/2 c. Home made whole wheat bread crumbs with 1 T. Italian seasoning, worked great.  I also added in 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper to the breadcrumb mixture.  I bypassed the skillet to avoid the excess oil per other reviews and use used a rack on top of a cookie sheet to bake and allow for air circulation so both sides were crispy.  Fun, new way to make pork chops and I will be making this again!

These were a hit!  I followed the recipe as written except for cutting down to 2 eggs.  I also used my own oven technique- placing the chops on a non-stick cooling sheet and cooking over a tin-foil cookie sheet, they brown nicely on both sides (easy clean up too).  My Salvadoran-Dominican fiance went crazy for these, they might almost replace the chipotle chuleta I make for him! ;)  Thanks so much for the recipe Elisaw!

This was very good.   I added garlic salt and pepper to breading mixture.  Also my pork chops were about an 1" thick so cooking time was much longer.   This will be one I'll make again!!!!

I followed the recipe as written, but I wasn't impressed by the results. The pork chops tasted OK. I've tasted better from simpler pork chop recipes. They smelled delicious as I fried them. They were crispy on the outside, but they were a tad dry on the inside. I wasn't impressed by the results because there's no flavor(s) that comes out and tells your taste buds, "Mmmm, this is really good." Like I said, I've done much simpler pork chops recipes that had more flavor and they used less ingredients than this recipe. Maybe it depends on the brand of breadcrumbs I used? I used Progresso Italian style breadcrumbs. Perhaps those breadcrumbs were the problem, but either way, this recipe wasn't anything special. I think the baking made them dry 'cause they smelled and looked delicious after I fried them, but looked crispy and kind of dry after I baked them. I wouldn't do them again. Sorry.

I really didn't find anything special about these.  I did follow one reviewers suggestion to place the chops on a wire rack rather than leave it in the pan.  In any case, I found these lacking overall flavor.  they stayed pretty moist, which was good, but was nothing special in my opinion. I may try something like this again but with the addition of some spices...

Simple and fun to make.  If you are looking for something a little higher quality than Shake 'n Bake, this is what you should use! Delicious.

This was easy and delicious! I used boneless pork loins that were already 'rubbed' with a favorite of ours. I used a little cold water as opposed to the milk and I cooked 'em about 15 min longer ( just to make sure) but don't think I needed to. None-the-less, they were still moist and tender! Will make again!

These pork chops were AMAZING!!!  I don't even normally like pork chops all that much, but I had to give this one a try after reading all the rave reviews.  I coated the chops in the flour/salt/pepper mixture as had been recommended, and that worked out great.  I added garlic powder, black pepper and seasoning salt to the bread crumb mixture (my staples).  My BF scarfed his pork chop down within minutes, so I knew this was a hit!  !will definitely make this one again!!!

Came out very tender and juicy. I did have to cook it a little longer than the time listed. But other than that followed directions exactly and it was very good.

Delicious!  I followed the advice from other reviewers, and they turned out perfect.  I used 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of milk.  I cut the bread crumbs, Parmesan, and parsley in half and there was still more than enough.  I dredged the pork chops in flour before dipping in the egg and bread crumbs.  This will be my pork chop recipe from now on!

Loved this recipe - I seasoned the flour with salt and pepper for dredging as per other reciews.  Ididn't use the parsley since I had it in the seasoned bread crumbs.  Had 8 chops with only the 2 eggs and it turned out fantastic.  Will definitely make again!

This is an excellent recipe.  Instead of using regular milk, I used buttermilk.  I did not have any Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I only had panko bread crumbs.  With the panko bread crumbs, I added McCormick's Italian season and the flavor was just fine.  The same technique will also work with any unseasoned bread crumbs.  Instead of adding chopped garlic to the hot olive oil, I added garlic powder to my bread crumb mix.  My substitution provided garlic flavor to the pork.  A nice touch was to add some dried onions to the bread crumb mix for some added zip.  As for the dried parsley, I don't believe you'll get much flavor.  However, parsley will add color to the pork chop.  Therefore, I omitted the parsley.  Overall, a very juicy and favorable pork chop.  Will make these again.

These are very good. I've made them for years,but never thought of them as a recipe. I just use an egg wash. One egg with a TBSP. of water or two. Brown them and lay them on a preheated cookie sheet to finish.

These were so good and full of flavor.  I added a little difference by dipping the pork chops in the eggs and then the bread crumbs cooked in a skillet for about 3 mins on each side then dipped them again in the eggs and the bread crumbs.  To me this added much more flavor and taste.  And my husband loved them!!

It was surprisingly simple and delicious. I was worried about the oven proof skillet, i have a limited amount of cookware, but i used my normal skillet and baked them on a cookie  i drizzled with olive oil and the browned garlic and it work flawlessly. - MickyMtz

I followed the recipe exactly except for the garlic cause hubby doesn't like it.   After I took them out of the oven I put the chops on a plate and added about 1/2 large tin of Italian diced tomatoes to the pan scraping up the brown bits, let the liquid reduce and browned the tomatoes a bit and put a serving onto the chops.   Perfect breaded pork chop recipe

I've been making breaded pork chops in the over forever. HOWEVER, this recipe is my only way to cook them from now on! I dried the chops with paper towel first, then dipped in flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs.  Not one bit of the breading came off. I did adjust the seasonings to my family's personal taste. There were no leftovers in this house.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!

I decided to try this recipe last night after taking pork chops out for dinner, and really not having a plan for them. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! Did a couple things different: First, I pounded out the chops a little beforehand to make sure they were nice and tender, also I added a little more olive oil to the skillet. I, like the other reviewers, did not put the skillet into the oven. I simply placed the chops onto a greased baking sheet and baked them for the 25 minutes. Perfect! Crisp, tender, juicy and so flavorful. My family loved them!

My husband couldn't believe my talents.  He even said, "Move over, mom's friend chicken! This is my new favorite meat". Wow! I did season them with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and then dunked them in flour prior to the egg wash.  As someone else suggested, I only sliced the garlic so it was easier to remove from the oil, though even that was a little difficult.  I browned the pork for about 3 minutes per side and then baked them for the suggested 25 minutes. What a delicious meal.  Thank you, ELISAW!

I really liked these pork chops, and so did the family. I double coated mine and I really liked the way it came out. A few days later I tried the breading on chicken breasts and they came out moist and yummy too.  Thanks for sharing!! Now I have a go to for breaded foods.

These were okay, but I wasn't very impressed. They didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped, and even though I DID fry them before baking, as the recipe says to, the crust still turned out a bit soggy. I don't think I'll be making these again. My husband didn't even go back for seconds, which is unusual for him!

I expected way more from this.  I love Italian food, but these just didn't do much for me.  I agree with other reviewers about the eggs being too much, so I used 1.  My breading fell off as I was trying to cut it...perhaps I did something wrong (although I did stay with the recipe)?  I probably won't risk the calories again, thanks anyway Elisa, it's just my opinion...which probably means squat to you after all of those great reviews ;-))

A good, basic pork chop recipe. I double-dipped mine, and still wound up tossing out a bunch of the breading, so I would say you could probably cut the bread crumbs down by at least half a cup.

Simply wonderful! I have served them to family and to friends at dinner parties with rave reviews from all.  These are better with a regular thickness pork chop as compared to a thick cut. The recipe is perfect as written. I however, did make some changes as not to waste anything. I use more oil when preparing the garlic, strain it and reserve the extra along with adding the browned garlic back into the extras oil. For another meal that week I heat this garlic infused olive oil in a skillet, toss cooked spaghetti noodles coating them with the oil. Sprinkle with Parmesan Cheese and mix through for yet for another meal. I use the extra prepared Italian Bread crumbs to make St. Louis Toasted Ravioli using leftover frozen Spaghetti sauce I have in the freezer another night. The leftover crumbs stay nice refrigerated for several days so no need to waste them.

Wow, so good!  Very flavorful and juicy!  Hubby really liked it, and he is neither a pork or fried food fan, so it must be good!  I loved it.  Served it with Oven Roasted Potatoes from this site, so good!  Will definitely make again, thanks for sharing!  Yum!

I've made this recipe several times.  It's fantastic!  Thank you for sharing it with us.
I am curious about the weight of the pork chops.  From my recipe calculator the calories are 49 more than on this recipe.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because with following the recipe as-is, mine came out pretty dry and the breading fell off and the cheese burnt/melted in the frying pan.  I think I will take the others recommendations and double dip in the egg wash and crumbs, maybe even first coating in flower too.

This is the best pork chop recipe I've done.  You don't need to cook pork to 160 though.  Anything over 145 is food safe.  I cooked to 150 and the chops were very moist.  I did brine the pork chops for 30 minutes before egg wash and coating.

Delicious, Pork Chops were moist, tender and full of flavor. I upped the recipe to 6 chops and used less than the calculated amount.Like some others I had way more egg and breadcrumbs than I needed. So I double breaded them and I still threw away egg and breadcrumbs. But this was a great recipe and will definately make it again!

We absolutely LOVED these!!  I used pork steaks, since we don't really care for pork chops and, I used 1/4 cup Parmesan and 1/4 cup Romano cheese, as it's what I had on hand.  The flavors all popped in this....especially loved the garlic in it!!  I can't wait to make these again!

My family "hates" pork chops. All of my children were moaning and groaning about having them for dinner. As a rule, they have to try what I make, and if they don't like it they can make themselves something else. Tonight we all ate the pork chops. The kids even raved about how good they were. The only change I made to the recipe was that I added garlic salt to the chops. Without salt, they just are not flavorful which is why I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5.

These turned out pretty good.  My husband loved them and i thought they were ok (but i think that breaded pork chops just aren't really to my taste, so not a real reflection on the recipe).  I had to make a few changes for what i had to hand, so used plain bread crumbs and added mixed herbs and garlic powder and used fresh parsley rather than dried.  The chops were lovely and crisp when i cooked them in the skillet, but were a bit soggy when i took them out of the oven.  Maybe next time I'd transfer them to a rack?

The taste was there, however I don't know if it was me or the recipe, but when I did these in the frying pan on the stove (pan not oven-proof) I had trouble getting the coating to stay on.  Made a nice side dish though!  Also, three eggs and all those breadcrumbs/parm. cheese is  a bit much for four pork chops.  I threw out the equivalent of about two eggs and at least 3/4 cup of bread crumbs and I put A LOT on the chops!  I will scale down the egg, milk, breadcrumb and cheese next time.  Overall, taste was good, but not a five start recipe.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's super easy, quick and flavorful.  While the pork chops are in the oven, it give you time to finish whatever else you may be preparing....in my case cauliflower puree & steamed peas.

I tried this recipe last night and it was a hit. My 11 yr. old, who is extremely picky loved them. The ONLY thing I did differently was to add some season salt to the bread crumb mixture and used 2 eggs instead of 3, since some of the other reviews said it was bland. I actually fixed 6 chops and it was more than enough of everything. I have added this to my recipe box and will be fixing this again.

I've made it couple of times practically as it is and it's definitely a keeper. Only few adjustments: use only 1 egg/1 tbsp milk and half of bread crumbs. Also if my chops are really thick I bake them longer - about 40 minutes

This was so simple, I didn't expect it to be so good!!  I may pat down with some paper towels before serving next time though.  I highly recommend this recipe :)

Very delicious. I used Panko bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand. I also dipped in flour before the egg. Can't wait to make these again!

we liked this dish, but found it a bit plain on it's own.  a splash of fresh lemon juice or maybe apple sauce would have helped spruce it up.  it would also be good with pasta and marinara.

These were very good pork chops.  I followed the recipe as written other than making one change.  I used 1 cup of Italian breadcrumbs and 1 cup pecorino romano cheese for my breading.

Yummy!  My husband loved these - my daughter did as well.  She usually doesn't eat pork chops but really loved these (I gave her some warm marinara to dip with).  Thank you so much...easy and delicious!

Pork isn't one of our favorite meats (except bacon) and pork chops are the least favorite.  But I run out of ideas for dinner and when I saw this decided to give it a try.  I didn't change a thing and it was delicious.  DH asked "what kind of pork chops are these?" thinking it was a special cut (I did use boneless).  He complimented them two or three times and eyeing the two leftovers said, "those will make a good sandwich."  This is a winner and easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing.

These are really good, moist on the inside and the breading is delicious. This recipe is a keeper. I plan to make this for guests the next time we invite friends over.

Delicious!  My husband could cut it with a fork it was so tender!  I would cut back on the bread crumb mixture next time...maybe half as there was alot left over.  I did dredge in flour before putting in egg mixture and then bread crumbs.

Very tasty.  The whole family liked them.  Cooking time will vary, watch closely.  I had mine in the oven for 20 minutes and they were overcooked.  Next time (there will certainly be a next time for these) I'll check the temp before they go in the oven and then continue to check every 8 minutes or so.  That aside this a very delicious way to make a pork chop.

This was one of the BEST dinners I've ever made!!! It turned out so good!!. I highly recommend it. I made one slight alteration to it, though. I didn't have any Italian breadcrumbs so I used Panko breadcrumbs instead and used robust Italian seasoning and the grated parm.......It was HEAVEN....My favorite part of couse was the burny parts on the bottom of the pan after searing, mmmmmmm yummy...I give it a 10!!

These were great!  I ended up with way too much of the breading, so I tossed a handful into a skillet with some green beans.  I still have a lot of breading, so I'm probably going to have Italian breaded chicken this week too.  And turkey burgers.  And deli ham.  Anyway, but the pork chops turned out perfectly.  I took them off the skillet and put them on a broiler tray for the oven part, and that seemed to work well.

All I can say is wow... I've had such bad luck with pork chops that I was a bit skeptical going into this but the picture looked so good. I ended up getting the thick cut, bone in pork chops. I used 4 of them and the eggs/bread crumbs worked out perfectly.  I took the suggestion of coating them in flour/seasoning then did the "shake and bake" method for the bread crumbs in a large gal freezer bag. Then browned them in the frying pan for about 2:30 each side on a medium heat (gas stove) then put them in the oven at 325 for 35 min. I've never had/made a juicier pork chop.. Served it with mashed potatoes and corn.

I reduced the egg mixture and bread crumb mixture as suggested by other reviews, I also dredged in flour first.  Everyone really enjoyed this!  I love Pork and I'll try any new way to cook it.

I followed all the advice given about dipping it in flour and seasonings but my pork chop came out overcooked and the breading fell off. I dont know if it was the cut I used because it was lean but I wasnt very pleased. It came out looking very pretty though.

Scrumptious... I also pound my pork chops before breading, just throw them in a zip lock bag and pound with your meat pounder..no mess that way.

Great recipe! I've made this several times now and the only thing I do differently is like another poster has said, I put the chops on a broil pan in the oven which cuts down on the grease and keeps the outside crispy.

These were wonderful.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the measurments were way off.  I used 1 large egg and 1 1/2 Tbls. milk.  Halved the amounts of breadcrumb, cheese and parsley and had enough for 6 boneless chops.  They never made it to the oven, I finished them up in the skillet.  So tasty and moist.  This is definitely a keeper.

Made a second time and they turned out wicked good. Used the iron skillet again.  Must have been the chops the first time that made them not tender. This time used butterfly chops and they came out awesome.


Very good.  Would have given 5 stars but my meat was not real tender.  Flavor outstanding. Double dipped in the egg and bread crumbs as suggested by some others.  I used a iron skillet to fry the chops in and would not recommend...wanted to pull the coating off. After fried, removed from skillet and put on broiler pan to bake in over.  My husband said they tasted just like the chops his mom made when he was growing up.

I loved this recipe! Simple, quick, and YUMMY!I usually make fried pork chops and this was a great alternative. I recommend using less egg (I had 2 large eggs and still had leftovers). I seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder and oregano. I didn't have parmesan cheese handy so I used shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheese instead. I didn't have an oven-proof skillet so I first used a non-stick skillet and then put them in a glass pan covered in foil for the 25 minutes in the oven. Came out moist and delicious! Will definitely make again. Thanks, Elisaw :)

One of my favorites in my rotation. I bought some sweet canned vinegar peppers in the store today and plan on serving on top of the pork chops tomorrow night. Think it might go well. Pork chops always come out moist and delicious. Great recipe!!

This is just about flavorless. Add salt to the meat and upon serving. Needs some spice to it.   I used 1jnch thick ckops, bake for 40 mintues.

The breading on this was like skin and very greasy.  I even cooked it longer to see if it would crisp up and it did not. Seems like all the people who loved this recipe changed it. I thought the 4.5 stars was for this actual recipe.

I loved this one! so did my husband, he practically devoured it! i followed others suggestions and floured the chops first and i dipped into the batter twice as well, so the coating would be a little thicker. i was wary of putting my skillet in the oven, so i just browned them in the skillet, then stuck them in a 13 X 9 in glass baking dish drizzled with olive oil. it came out great! they were moist and delicious. i served them with some butter & herb mashed potatoes. i took a picture of them but it didnt come out good on my camera , LOL.

These were fantastic and easy.  I used four pork chops and I pounded them out a bit..not real thin.  I dredged in some seasoned flour and then egg and milk mixture and then finally into the bread crumbs.  I mixed bread crumbs and panko crumbs only cause I was trying to finish those off.  The bread crumb mixture was about 3/4 c and then I used a heaping 1/2 cup of parm cheese.I sprayed a skillet with olive oil spray and put maybe a 1/2 T of butter.  I used 4 cubes of the frozen garlic from Trader Joe's and once that heated I put the chops in the pan...about 4 - 5 minutes on each side.  I then sprayed a glass baking dish with a little more olive oil and baked uncovered for 25 minutes.  These were perfection!

My husband and I loved this meal. I didn't have a oven proof skillet (or not one I was sure about) so I browned the pork chops in the skillet and then moved them oven to a baking sheet. I baked them for about 25 minutes. They were perfect. Pork chops can be tough, but these were as tender as they could be.

This recipe is great! This is the second time I made it and it turned out just as good as the first. I did only use 1 cup of bread crumbs and 2 eggs because the first time a lot went to waste and this was enough for 5-6 pork chops. I also dredged the chops in salt/pepper flour mix before the egg mixture and added garlic and italian seasoning to the bread crumbs.  My boyfriend loves these chops! Even my 2 year old stated "Mmm thats good!" I will make this many more times to come. I would suggest using the roasting rack, chops are less greasy and more crispy! Yum!

Excellent recipe!  My family absolutely loved these pork chops.  I double dipped mine which made a fantastic crust.  I was impressed at how much flavor the breading had.  I did add some garlic powder and onion salt to my flour mixture for a little more kick.

The pork chops were good, but tasted almost exactly like the oven "fried" pork chops I usually make. The bread crumb mixture yields about twice as much as is needed to coat 4 pork chops. Next time, I think I will use only 1 cup of breadcrumbs so the parmesean flavor can really come through.

I just made this recipe, but having read the reviews, I made a few changes. I added a pork rub to some flour to coat the chops, then egg and seasoned breadcrumbs with some cornmeal added. lot's of flavour and crunch. Yum!

These chops were delicious! Instead of frying them a bit & putting in oven, I just fried them very slowly on the stove & sprinkled a bit of light cheese over the tops that melted.  Everyone was impressed!

Very easy to make.  I actually pan seared these first, placed them in a corningware dish and let set (had to wait for the boys to come home).  Covered with foil and cooked for about 1/2 hour.  Perfect!

I made these chops and they were a big hit.  My husband loved them and I'll certainly make them again.  The seasoned crumbs and parmesan were a great idea. I'll never make the plain ones again.

I've been using AllRecipes for a couple of years now... but this is my first review! I would give this dish more stars if I could. I made this for my husband's 40th birthday and he absolutely loved it! I used thick center-cut chops and they were VERY tender and juicy. There are a number of other pork chop recipes that call for you to cook in a mushroom sauce. I skipped this and made a mushroom gravy on the side with mushroom soup, fresh mushrooms, onion, garlic, chix broth and a little white wine. Served it with rice and stir fried sugar snap peas. There were NO leftovers! Thanks for the super recipe!!!

Decided to check out this recipe for something a little different then just plain breaded pork chops.  The pork chops had a nice flavor but could have used a little less cooking time.  I took the advice of a fellow reviewer and added some garlic powder plus some season salt and fresh ground pepper.  Will try this recipe again, but use either thicker pork chops or cut down on the cooking time.

I've made this recipe twice now, and it was (even more) wonderful the 2nd time.  I used a bone-in, thicker cut chop.  I also used a bit of olive oil cooking spray to try and reduce calories/fat, but ended up needing to use the olive oil to keep the chops from sticking.  I will make this again & again & again!

I made these just as instructed but used boneless pork loin instead.  They were just under an inch thick and I monitored the temperature so as to not under or overcook.  They were delicious and very moist.  I will make these again for sure.  I served them with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil from this site and roasted asparagus (which is really easy - just sprinkle asparagus w/olive oil, add the garlic from this pork chop recipe, and shallots if you want; then throw it in the oven along w/the pork chops (in its own casserole) and just toss the asparagus around a couple times while roasting).  DELICIOUS meal!

I tried this recipe last night and it was the first time I breaded anything.  It was really easy and tasty too.  My honey couldn't stop talking about it.  I personally felt like something was missing, but it was still good.  The only thing I did differently was I added 2 tbsp of fresh basil, and a tsp. each of oregano and rosemary.  I also used grapeseed oil instead of olive because its a lighter oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were excellent!  My pork loin chops were 1/2 inch thick, so I seared them for 1 and a half minutes per side.  I put them in a glass pan to bake in the oven for 25 minutes and they turned out perfect!  So crispy on the outside and juicy and succulent on the inside.  This is delicious and easy recipe!  I do recommend that you cut back on the breading, you end up wasting a great deal,so half it!

this recipe is so ubelievably good 
mandy have said their chops were dry.  when browning, cook at med/high heat to sear the juices in. should only be a couple of minutes per side.  finish off in the oven as directed and they will be perfect everytime.  i believe cooking time in the oven should also reflected in the thickness of the chops.  mine were about 1/2" thick and came out perfect. the entire group, (6 kids and 2 adults) loved them..thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

For 6 chops, made the following changes & still had plenty of breading:  2 eggs, 1 T milk, 3/4 c bread crumbs, 1/4 c parmesan cheese, 1 T parsley, garlic powder to taste.  As recommended, I dipped pork in a flour/salt mix before dipping in egg mix.  
If you are expecting a huge burst of flavor, add more spices & be creative.  They were nice & moist, though.

Easy and delicious.  I love pork chops and this was one of the best recipes.  The chops were moist and tender - cut with fork tender.  Very tasty.  I did add a dash of red pepper flakes for a kick, otherwise did not deviate from the recipe.  The pan drippings made an excellent gravy.  Will certainly fix again.  The recipe goes to the top of my list of favorites.  Thank you for posting this one!  Marty

I love this recipe. My cousin got a friend of ours eating it and now I am hooked. I add extra cheese to the recipe and cut down on the bread crumbs it always seems like I have too much mixture leftover.

I thought these were tasty but not fantastic. I'd probably make again, but maybe tweak the recipe a little. The pork chops did come out nice and moist, I just felt the recipe was missing something.

This is now my family's favorite way to fix pork chops.  I use the Italian bread crumbs and add extra garlic powder.  Once I was low on bread crumbs and used panko bread crumbs with Italian seasoning added and they were still excellent.  I do cut back on the eggs, 2 eggs with a dash of milk for 6 pork chops is plenty. My husband likes that they stay moist and juicy.  I usually make extra so we have leftovers for our lunches the next day.

Made these tonight with thick boneless pork loin chops.  I cut off all the visible fat and pounded the chops down to about 1/4-inch thickness, then breaded them ahead of time by shaking in a ziplock baggie with flour; then dipping in egg/milk mixture; then dipping in breadcrumb/cheese mixture.  I placed them on a foil-lined cookie sheet in my refrig until ready to cook.  I could have easily reduced the egg and milk mixture and the breadcrumb and cheese mixture each by about 1/3.  Browning them for 5 minutes over medium heat on each side is way too long.  My chops got a little dark.  Next time I will cut the time down to about 2 minutes.  Otherwise, a very delicious way to prepare pork chops.  They were definitely a hit with my family.

I have been making this same exact recipe for many years and it is by far the best breaded pork chop recipe out there! There is no need at all to dredge the pork chops thru flour first as some have suggested. The egg/milk is plenty to keep the bread crumbs/cheese mixture adhered to the chops plus once they are browned it all stays on. This goes great with mashed potatoes and a veggie.

I made this for my family tonight and it turned out really good!  It was pretty easy to make too.  I took some suggestions from other comments.  I only used one eggs and I left the garlic in the pan while cooking the pork chops.  I also do t have an oven safe pan so I put them onto a glass baking dish before putting them in the oven.  We will definitely be making this again!

Based on reviews, I began by dredging the pork in a flour salt/pepper mixture, then in the egg, followed by the bread crumbs.  I pan fried on each side and baked in the oven.  I didn't turn the meat and it was perfect - the breading stayed on and the meat was moist.  We will make this again.

The whole family loved this dinner.  Really good. I did pound the chops thinner before frying. Frying made the coating so nice and crispy.  I made a McCormick's pork gravy on the side for the kids but my husband said he preferred it without gravy. I pulled them out of the oven at 20 minutes and think they were overlooked a bit. I blame myself however and not the recipe.  Pounding the chops thinner should reduce the cooking time a bit.

These are the best chops ever!  It was a hit!  I did take the reviewers advice and did a flour dip before the egg wash. Also, I had no oven proof skillet, so I used the method suggested by another reviewer, cookie rack over cookie sheet. They were wonderful.  I agree the egg wash and bread crumb mixture were plentiful but for a new cook it was nice to have plenty.

They were good, but nothing spectacular.  Even though our family is not Italian, we had food prepared this way often growing up.  I was hoping for a recipe that would produce moist, flavorful meat.  But I followed the instructions and the meat was still a bit dry.

I recently made these pork chops for the second time.  They are wonderfully flavorful and tender.  My guys love them.  I do too.  I normally make 8 chops and find 2 eggs to be enough along with the milk for dipping before placing them in the bread crumb mixture.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. However, the bread crumb and Parmesan amounts are excessive. Even after breading all 4 chops I hadn't used even a fourth of the mix. I would cut it at least in half.

Just had this for dinner. They are awesome. I too first used flour with a bit of paprika and pepper. Used Italian bread crumbs with some Panko mixed in.  I also turned the chops over once while in the oven, don't know that you need to.  Next time I will add a bit more spice or herbs for flavor but I loved the crunch and the tenderness.  Thanks a bunch.

I made this last night and the entire family loved it. The only change I made was to use shredded parmesan instead of grated. I served it with Marilyn's Green Beans Italiano, also from this site, and parsley potatoes, with a half cup of sour cream to take them up to another level. The whole meal was worthy of 10 stars. Thank you Elisaw for sharing such a marvelous meal. Those chops would be a customer pick on any restaurant menu.

These were delicious!!  Made exactly as is, didn't try the flour like some others, but I used cheap cut chops that contained enough fat to keep them moist.  If you're using leaner cuts I would do the flour coating to seal in juices.  Thanks for a great recipe -- my mom used to make this often when we were kids!'

Quick and tasty! Only took 18 minutes in the oven @ 350 for the pork to reach 145*. Will definitely make again.

husband and kids loved it.  I've never been a big fan of pork chops, but these weren't as dry as most I have had and the coating was tasty

I'm not a pork chop fan to begin with but I saw some beautiful chops at the market and went searching for a recipe to spice them up a bit.  Unfortunately, this recipe didn't do anything to enhance the flavor.  They were quite bland, no flavor whatsoever.  I will definitely not use this recipe again.

Followed the recipe as stated. Wouldn't change a thing. No longer apprehensive about pork chops. These were very tender and juicy. Will be making these on a regular basis.

We really like this recipe, and it is fairly quick to prepare.  The egg/breading ratio to chops is way off, though.  1/3 of each is plenty for 5 smallish chops, which is what my family needs.  I halved it tonight, and still threw out a ton of extra breading:( Anyway, the only change was adding garlic powder and italian seasoning to the breadcrumb mixture (abt 1/2 tsp each for half the breading), negating the need to add fresh garlic to the oil.  I cooked abt 2-3 min per side in oil, then out on rack over a cookie sheet to bake in oven for 25 min.  Yum!

I had high hopes for this recipe, it just sounded so yummy and has a great rating. While it was cooking it looked perfect and smelled good, but once i took my first bite i was very disappointed! I followed the recipe and even took a few suggestions from the reviews and it was just nasty. I think i ate maybe 4 bites, my husband hated it too he only ate half his pork chop. what a waste of food!!

My husband liked these.  I didn't care for them.  The breading wasn't very crunchy, and I wasn't that excited by the taste.

This is similar to my Mom's recipe, and turned out really good. Only suggestion is to be sure on the recipe to include the thickness of the pork chops as the cook times will be different. VERY tasty!

First, there were too many eggs listed for ingredients. Then, too many bread crumbs. Then it calls for browning the garlic and removing it; the result is not much garlic flavor. Would not make again.

I am in the processes of making these and have to say I think the egg dip and bread crumb portions are WAY too much for 4 pork chops.  One egg (xl maybe) and 2 tbs milk are sufficient for the dip and then maybe 1/2 cup bread crumbs & 1/4 parmesan are all you need for the breading.  

But I am looking forward to seeing how these turn out!

This was pretty good, they were not as moist as i had hoped, as i used center cut chops, so next time i will cut the cook time down a little, i didn't dredge in flour first so the nice coating easily slid off so i will try that. i also loved the garlic and left in skillet. all in all i liked it with a little season salt and fresh ground pepper..a winner

Best pork chops I ever made!I also double dipped them as others did. I used a cast iron skillet.I could brown them and put into the oven in the same pan.
They came out tender and juicy. Excellent flavor!My husband loved them. Will be using this method from now on. Thanks.

These chops are delicious! I discovered this recipe a little over a month ago and have already made it 3 times. I use 2 tablespoons of milk and 2 eggs instead of 3 for the mixture, it still covers all of the chops.

This was good.  Nice flavor.  Our chops were much too thick, so the time was off, but with a regular chop I think this recipe would be perfect!

DH and I really loved these pork chops.  They came out moist and tender, something I have a hard time pulling off with chops.  I used center cut, bone in chops.  Only had plain bread crumbs on hand so I used them and added some Italian seasoning.  And as other suggested, I double dipped in the egg and breading.

Great and easy recipe.  The chops turned out moist and delicious.  I used panko bread crumbs because that's all I had in the pantry.  All my boys liked it, including the picky one.  That's saying something!

I've been looking for a good pork chop recipe and I've finally found it!  I adapted the recipe following the suggestions of other reviewers and I also used a brine (Alton Brown's 2 Hr Mustard Brine)...it adds to the prep time but it also makes them moist and flavorful. I also seasoned the chops with onion powder and pepper and dredged in flour before the egg wash. I reduced the amount of the egg and crumb mixtures as suggested and still had plenty. Used Panko not Italian breadcrumbs because that's what I had on hand.  My chops were thinner so I browned them  about 2 minutes each side and 15 mins in the oven until they reached 160* . This is a keeper...we really enjoyed them!

Was looking for a basic recipe as I normally do not have all ingedients on hand. These look great and taste great.  I used 5 pork chops and had a lot of crumbs left over.  If I were to make this again, I would reduce the crumb mixture so there is not as much left over.

I usually dry out my chops and my family doesn't really like pork chops.  However, DH took one bite last night and said WOW.  They were really juicy.  Tips of dredging in flour first (w/spices), egg wash then 3/4 cup bread crumbs worked perfect.  Followed all directions including cast iron fry pan, put in oven 15 minutes and perfect.  Served w/green beans and hash browns.   Part of rotation now.

Followed the directions directly and they looked fantastic. The taste however was not appealing. I'm a good ol southern boy that loves southern cooking, but sometimes I like to try something different. This is one of those times that I wish I hadn't tried something. I give it 3 stars cause it was easy to make, but the taste just didn't make us happy. Not going to be making this again, or even any variance of it.

My family said this was the best pork chop they had ever had!  I used very thick, bone-in pork chops and cooked it in my cast-iron skillet.  Thank you very much for this delicious and easy recipe!   Definitely going to add to my kitchen.

If you use boneless pork chops and pound them thin, you don't need to bake them, and they come out fork tender. I used some garlic salt instead of the garlic cloves. Excellent recipe.

I have used this recipe many times It is excellent.  I have tried to do a first egg-milk dip in flour, then in brad crumb mix gives a thicker coat. Also,I hate to waste,so I put the breading mix in a Serving saver container, which I keep in the freezer. I pour some into a Pan IE Breadpan, After egging dip chops in pan, turn over and sprinkle other side of the chops. I then return the excess crumbs to the freezer. OK so I am A cheap SOB.This is a Great recipe.

I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews first.  The feedback I had was the same as many others: not that flavorful, too much egg & breadcrumbs left over, and you need to reduce the baking time.  Sorry.

3 eggs was way too many. I used 2 and that was plenty.  The pork chops turned out tender and delicious.  Will definately make these over boring shake and bake any day!

This is so much better than the way I used to do these. Used panko, seasoned it myself, used thinner, boneless chops so cut the oven time by 10 minutes. Will use this and variations of it again and again - Thank alot for  posting it.

Very easy and yummy. I dredged in flour first and added garlic powder there. Also used Italian seasoned panko crumbs and added parmesan there. Cripsy crunchy good.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and they couldn't have turned out better!  The crust was crispy and held the moisture in the meat wonderfully.  I'm excited to make this again and again to play with the flavors that go into the bread crumb mixture (not that I didn't like it as is, just to add some personal touches).

I really enjoyed this - but it definitely needed more seasoning. Will make again! I used a baking dish, but should have turned them half way through baking (bottom was more moist than the topsides). The 'roasting rack' suggested here sounds like a good idea.

Calls for way too many bread crumbs.  Wasted a ton.  Probably should be 4 and 3 minutes on each side.

I felt the sage in the bread crumbs to be way to strong and overpowered this dish.  In the future I might mix the seasoned bread crumbs with plain bread crumbs.  It was also a bit greasy.

the recipe, is excellent. DELICIOUS, MOIST, & FLAVORFUL! if           NOTE: if you plan to double the recipe, you'll only really need 1 more egg, & maybe 2 Tblspn of milk. also the the last few i fried had a less than desireable flavor, i'll probably reserve some of the oil, & rinse the pan half way through next time

Perfect! I loved these pork chops... the family loved them as well. I made 8 from the ingredients and I still had too much egg batter and bread crumb mixture. I added minced garlic to the olive oil instead and the garlic stuck to the pork chop which made it taste great. Can't wait to make these again!

Wow, up until tonight we referred to pork chops as pork chips around our house.  Tonight I tried this recipe and they turned out fabulous.  They were tender and moist and extremely tasty!  I followed the directions exactly except that I mixed both the egg and crumb mixtures in pie plates instead of small bowls.  Thanks Elisaw!  I know I will be making these often.

These were just OK.  I wish ELISAW added what thickness pork chop she uses as 35 minutes total cooking time is WAY TOO LONG for your average 3/4" thick chop.  I browned on stove for 3 mins per side and in the oven for 15 minutes.

The frying and cooking time are a bit long (2min per side and 20 in the oven is fine at least w/ a thinner pork chop).  My biggest issue with these was that they were pretty bland.  If I made them again I would probably liberally season the chops before coating, then I would double bread them and make sure to mix some papprika or chili powder into the coating to give them some pop.

We had bought a bunch of real thick chops on sale and they always came out a bit dry. This recipe was delicious and the chops were moist and tender. This recipe is a keeper! I dreged the chops in the bread crumb mixture before dipping in the eggs then let them rest for five minutes before frying which makes the crust stick better. I also used just the egg white and water instead of milk.

My boyfriend is half Sicilian and he is an Italian food freek. He LOVED this recipe! I did not modify it all. I do not eat pork chops but he said this was definitely one of the best pork chops he's ever eaten. He even ate leftovers the next day and he RARELY does.

This pork was very good.  I will make again.  I took suggestions and used half of the bread crumb mixture.  I added "Italian Herb Mix" to plain bread crumbs, since I didn't have the Itailian Seasoned Bread Crumbs in recipe.

I was looking for a good recipe to go with mushroom risotto and this was amazing. The pork chops were so flavorful and tender. My boyfriend loved them!  I browned them in the pan and then transfered them to a glass dish to finish baking and they came out perfect. I will definitely be making these again.

I made these last night and they were delicious. Next time, I will skip the garlic step-what a disaster-it did not do anything to enhance the dish. I will add some garlic powder and a few other seasonings to the breading (maybe oregano and thyme). I did roll the chops in flour before the egg was and it did seem to help the breading stick better. Overall, a real winner (my two kids even asked for seconds!).

Great recipe! I only made very minor changes- I only used 2 eggs instead of three and tossed in a bit of garlic salt and pepper. Very moist and tender. Will definitely add this to my dinner rotation.

This was a good recipe-chops weren't dried out-but I would call them "Toupee Chops" because the layer of seasoning just came off!  So I am going to try Turtlemetu's idea and flour them BEFORE the egg and bread crumb mixture and I think that will solve the problem. ; )

These chops were delicious. I followed the recommendation of dredging the chops in salt, pepper and flour prior to the egg dip.  I plan to serve these easy and yummy chops at a dinner party.

I made this before and it was the bomb. I forgot to add it to my recipe box, and I was just tweaking out trying to find this again. Was getting kinda scared there LOL. Last time (not sure if I wrote a review already, my boyfriend got Italian crutons instead of bread crumbs. I was so upset but it actually turned out wonderfully.

YUMMY! I did the flour dredge like others with s&p. I also cut back to 2 eggs and next time will probably only need one.  After I pan fried them I moved them to an oiled cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet and they turned our perfectly coated and browned on all sides! My 2yr old even asked for seconds!!! This was the first time I've made breaded chops and the whole family enjoyed them! Will be making again! Thanks :)

I wanted to give this three and 1/2 or three and 3/4 stars but it wasn't an option. I liked this recipe but I also marinated my meat overnight. I don't think it would have had enough flavor without the marinade. I marinated them with italian dressing, red white, onion powder, garlic powder, and tony's seasoning. I put some garlic powder in the bread crumb mix as well. They were yummy and juicy. Will make again

This is a great way to make a relatively simple but nice dinner for your family in well under an hour beginning to end. I used homemade breadcrumbs from heels of bread I would throw in freezer. I just threw in processor with dried 'italian seasoning' and it was wonderful. I dont think the garlic is a necessary step, I found that garlic powder sufficed and cut out a step and added time. This was great with mashed potatoes and sweet peas!

These were good - not great. 4 stars for the recipe itself...as others have said the measurements are off. Decrease the breadcrumbs and the milk. I may make again with adjustments.

I did not care for this.  The breading became mushy after I put it in the oven.  I prefer a crispier outside.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Excellent recipe. Pork chops can be dry and fairly tasteless. This recipe prevents that.

Wow, really great!  I took the advise of one of the gals and "double dipped" the porkchops to make the crust stick better.  This was the first time  that my breading actually worked!  I am a fan of cooking with a cast iron skillet and with this recipe it really matters to get that full flavor - not sure why a lot of people don't use them more.  This recipe was awesome and will be made again - thanks for sharing this with us.

Lovely change from same-old. same-old pork chops. I followed the recipe but cooked them in a cast iron fry pan on the barbque - indirect heat (one side on, the other off) much better than putting the oven on when the weather's warm!  Served with brown rice and sauteed veg (again use your bbq).  Great standby recipe for pork chops.

Pretty good, and fairly easy. I followed the recipe to the letter... except for I took a tip from one of the reviewers saying to coat the chops in flour first. Worked like a charm. Unfortunately I ended up throwing away a full cup of breadcrumbs. It seemed like a lot of waste. Also... what does "Remove garlic, reserving for other uses" mean? It doesn't mention it later in the recipe.

I didn't have any egg so I dredged in seasoned flour, then just milk, and PANKO bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasoning. I put panko in caps because it was wonderful! This was my first time working with panko OR making breaded chops and I couldn't have been happier. This reminded me of chicken parm. I think a side of pasta would be perfect. Skip roasted potatoes, not a good pairing.

Delicious...I left the garlic in the pan and used only 1 egg and half the dried bread crumb mixture and I did dust with flour salted and peppered before dipping in the egg and bread crumbs.  Fast and easy with great results.

These are wonderful and so tender ... BUT, for 4 pork chops, the bread crumb mix and the eggs are way too much!  Next time, I'll use just 1 egg and 1 TBS milk, and 3/4 c. seasoned bread crumbs and 1/4 c. Parmesan.  Otherwise, so much is wasted.  Having said that, we followed the directions exactly and the chops were DELICIOUS and TENDER.  My mother in law raved about them!!!  :!)

I used thin 8 pork chops because my little children prefer them.I rubbed some garlic powder on both sides of each pork chop instead of using garlic cloves,then coated them with flour before dunking in eggs and bread crumbs.I browned about 2~3 minutes on each side then cooked in the oven for about 12~13 minutes. I will make again :)

My family loved these! We'd never had "Italian" pork chops before so it was something new and delicious for us. I followed one reviewers suggestion to dredge the chops in flour seasoned with salt and pepper before dipping in the egg and bread crumbs which helped LOTS with the breading staying on! I would like to add that although I used 4 very large chops, the 3 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of Italian seasoned bread crumbs were too much and I had lots left ... next time I'll cut it to 2 medium eggs and at least half the bread crumbs. Loved these and will make again!!

I also used one less egg and it was still too much. I have tried to make breaded pork chops before but the breading never stayed on. This time I let the oil heat up first and then used the flour-salt-pepper mixture before the egg and it was PERFECT! I now know how to keep the breading on. I also used a clear glass casserole dish for baking and they turned out delicious! This is by far the best pork chops I have ever made I ate 2 and my 4yr old actually ate them with no complaints. They were juicy and moist. This is going in my cookbook for sure. For the F.S.P mix I used 1/2 cup flour then eye balled the salt and pepper part. Worked great tasted awesome!

These were just O.K.  The coating did stick to the bottom of the pan, and I agree with others that the quantity of the bread crumb mixture is way too much for the number of chops being used.

This is a perfect recipe if you need to whip up something quick, easy and delicious.  I didn't change one thing from it.  PS: Many have commented on which to dipped the chops in first--the breading or the eggs.   I tried both options and dipping in the egg worked out best for me. If you like them really breaded, having eggs on first will guarantee extra crunch. I love this recipe because I realized quickly, that I could either follow by heart or get really creative with it...(eg: homemade bread crumbs, different flavored breadcrumbs, shredded provolone or whichever cheese I feel like at the time etc...) and whichever way I choose-it will turn out great because it is so easy!  Thanks so much---hubby has already requested to please please make again :-)

I loved these pork chops! Kinda had the Stove Top stuffing taste to them.  The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because it calls for too much egg and breading. Had I been a good student I would have read the other reviews and learned this and wouldn't have had to throw away perfectly good extra.

I made this recipe tonight and it was excellent!!  My fiance even went as far as to say that if I made it every single night from now on that would be just fine with him....even our picky 2 year old ate them all up and he won't eat any kind of meat.  I took a few of the other suggestions and cut the egg wash and bread crumb mixture in half and I also coated them in a flour and salt and pepper mixture first to get the coating to stick.  It worked wonders.  This will definitely become a regular dinner at our house.

Loved these pork chops!  I altered the recipe as per other reviewers suggestions & think they are a keeper!  I coated the pork chops in a flour, salt & pepper mixture before dipping them into the egg/milk wash.  This really helped keep the egg and breading on the chops.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of cumin and 1 Tbs. Italian seasoning to the breading mixture and I think they turned out amazing!  Already a family favorite!  Thank you:)

This was a BIG hit at our house!  Very tasty and a different take on the usual "Shake n Bake" style pork chops. As others have mentioned, you end up with way too much bread crumb mixture, so I'll cut down on that next time. Otherwise, a great, simple recipe!

These came out great!  I followed the advice of some others and double breaded. I felt this gave it extra flavor!  My husband and I both loved them, and they were still yummy the next day at lunch!  Would make a great sandwich too!

These were fantastic. I dredged in flour before dipping into my egg wash. I also made eight chops and used the serving size for 4 to make the bread crumbs and egg wash. I still had a heck of a lot left over so if making 4 or 6 chop I recommend you cut the recipe in half so your not wasting ingredients.

Yummy! Made a couple changes for what I had on hand. I used Italian Seasoning in place of the dried parsley. I also added garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture as I did not brown them in the skillet first. Instead of browning them then baking, I allowed butter to melt in my glass baking dish in the pre-heated oven and then placed my chops in it. I used 6 medium sized bone-in chops and they came out perfect! Delicious! Will definitely be using this recipe in my regular rotation from here on out. Thanks!

I absolutely loved this recipe as does my husband and our 2 young kids.  The 1 and only change I made was to use Panko style bread crumbs (which come in Italian flavor) instead of the regular bread crumbs.  The breading is a little crunchier and seems to hold to the pork chop better as well.

Great recipe.  I took others advice and first dipped the chops into flour first, the egg, and then the bread crumbs.  It turned out very moist!  Thanks

I reduced the bread crumbs, used only 1 egg, added salt & pepper, & cut out the milk. I squeezed a fresh lemon over the top before cooking in cast iron skillet for about 45 minutes. I have made this a dozen times & it always turns out perfect. 5 stars after changes!!

This was my first time ever making Pork Chops and it was a HUGE success. I only made 2 and my boyfriend said that was probably for the best because if I'd made more he would have eaten it all. He loved it! I followed user suggestions and coated the chops in flour (whole wheat) and salt and pepper before dipping into the egg/milk mixture. I doubled the amount of garlic and left it in the oil, instead of removing it. And I added garlic powder and italian seasonings to the breadcrumb/parmesan mixture. Next time I will make less of this mix because there was tons left over. Seemed like a waste.
Anyways, the chops came out SO moist and flavorful and I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

I must say, I love this recipe.  Like most, I doctored to my own tastes.  I used 4 good size chops, marinated with olive oil and apple cider vinegar.  used a cup of flour with salt and pepper to taste and coated chops first before dipping in egg batter, refloured, re-dipped,and then rolled in crumbs.  make sure to use the rack to keep 'em nice & crispy.  make sure not to over-cook, moist and delicious is your goal. 
***Make sure to add lemon juice when frying, the more the better***
don't be afraid to use more olive oil with the extra flour and bread crumbs.
garlic works best if sauteed in medium slices and semi-browned   i served with a fresh marinara sauce and there wasn't a crumb left, the breading was amazing.

A great recipe for pork! Made these last night for dinner. Served with Betty Crocker roasted garlic potatoes. I scaled the recipe to 3 servings (I purchased a package of 3 pork sirloin steaks for $2.58 - too cheap to pass up!). Here's how I modified this recipe. Instead of using 2 1/4 eggs (how do you measure that??!!?!?!), I only used 2. I sauteed some bottled minced garlic in olive oil as directed, but didn't remove it from the skillet when I added the chops. Double-breaded / pan-fried my chops and skipped the oven alltogether (I was afraid that the oven would dry out my thin-cut pork steaks). The only regret I have is not removing the garlic. I understand the reasoning for sauteeing the garlic - it adds flavor to the oil that the chops brown in. However, my garlic burned (I had to sautee the chops on med-high heat to cook them through, which wasn't a good idea for the garlic... oh well!). I did have quite a bit of crumb mixture left, but would prefer to have more than enough rather than run short. Turned out great! Thanks for sharing. : )

this recipe was so simple to do. And it was delicious. The pork chops were juicy and tender, and we all know how tough pork chops can be to cook.  I stuck to the recipe ver batum.

This recipe was ok.  I felt it needed more seasonings in the bread crumb mix.  Overall it just tasted kind of bland.  BF and our guest Chef Tony didn't seem too impressed.

I have been cooking pork chops for a long time and this was, by far, the best pork chop recipe I ever made!!!!!!  I followed the recipe as it was written.  I did double dip the chops in the egg mixture and then back into the bread crumbs to ensure they were evenly coated.  After frying them, I transfered the chops to a baking dish and covered them in stewed tomatoes.  Baked them for 45 minutes (they were thick).  My family LOVED them.  My husband said "they rock, make them like this all the time".

This is a nice option for pork chops.Definitely reduce bread crumbs to 3/4 c and less than 1/2c for the parmesan. I used two eggs and still had too much with 6 thin chops.Try 1 large egg. I coated my chops first in flour, egg, breadcrumb mixture. I added a little sprinkle of garlic salt with the breadcrumbs. I did need more oil than stated,but I added light margarine to keep it lighter. I placed mine on a broiler pan to keep the crispness. Since I used thinner chops I only had to cook them approx. 15 min. after the pan cooking. My husband loved them. Great flavor and I made mashed potatoes with parmesan and butter to go with it. We have a new way to add to the mix! Thanks!

My family loved this dish. My husband said "this is the best thing that happened to him all day!" I used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Added a great flavor. Will make this again. I will use a rack as suggested in other posting.

Delicious! I dipped raw chops in flour with salt and pepper before the eggs and crumb mixture.  That helped the breading stay on. The left overs even tasted great the next day.

Good stuff.  I find that the recipe calls for waaay too much of pretty much every ingredient.  I figure I could have made another 10 Chops on top of the four that the recipe called for - but they were quite tasty. Will try some other suggested modifications next time.

The whole family loved it! As stated by other reviewers, too much breadcrumb mixture and egg mixture.  Will half breadcrumb mixture and decrease to 2 eggs.

I made these over the weekend.  Served with the "Penne & Mushrooms" recipe from this site.  My family loved it!  I used thin cut boneless pork chops, so I used a meat thermometer when I put them in the oven - was careful not to overcook, as recommended by other reviewers.

These pork chops are delicious!  They are so tender.  My husband and I both love them!  I use Pecorino Romano cheese instead of parmasean.  Has a little more kick.

Excellent pork chops.  We actually added a little to this also.  We stuffed the pork chops with a mixture of horseradish and cheese.  It was great!  Served with red potatoes tossed with spices and parmesan cheese (cooked in the oven) and a side salad.  Wonderful meal!

Oh, my goodness!  These were the most tender and juicy pork chops I have ever eaten.  We had company for dinner and I served them with potato casserole and a salad. My guests asked me for the recipe for these delicious pork chops.  These will be a regular at my house!

I think these pork chops came out great!  I went ahead and left the garlic in the oil, since I love garlic.  I also cut back on the egg and milk mixture.  I had small pork chops, and for 4 small ones, I only used 1 egg plus 1 egg yolk, and 1 tbsp. cream.  It was plenty.  I also only used about 3/4 cups bread crumbs.  I liked this recipe because the pork came out tender and juicy, and it was so fast and easy to make.  I served it with dinner rolls, mashed potatoes, and salad.

I made this recipe thinking it would be loved by my husband (I've never cared for breaded chops), I did reduce the egg and breading mixture. As it turns out I LOVED IT! It's now one our favorites!! Thank you so much. Tasty, juicy and WONDERFUL!! HATS OFF TO YOU ON THIS ONE!!

Surprisingly bland for breaded & sauteed chops.  Followed the recipe to a tee (and, yes, it is WAY too much liquid and crumbs - halve this part of the recipe).  02/13/09 Update:  tried this one again, dredging pounded boneless chops in seasoned flour first.  Much better!

First thing you should know is that the amount of egg mixture and breading produced was about 4 times as much as I needed for my 4 chops.  Definitely reduce that part.  Secondly, I was very disappointed to find that this did not turn out as well as I'd hoped. The flavor was good, but the chops came out VERY dry. The meat I had purchased was very good, so I know this time it wasn't that. Therefore, unfortunately, I'm still on the lookout for a good pork chop recipe.

I always get so frustrated cooking pork chops, but now my frustrations have been elminated, by trying this recipe.  These are wonderful and so easy.  I used thin bone in chops and only put them in the oven for about 10 minutes after browning them on the stove, but I am sure these would work with just about any chops.  Great, quick recipe and I have passed it on! Thank you.

These porkchops are so easy to prepare. They are moist and taste wonderful. My family loves them. One mistake some people make is that they overcook pork which then becomes dry and tough.

These were great!  I cut the amount of breading and egg mixture by half and still had more than enough for 6 thin chops, so I'll cut it even further next time.  But these were very tasty, and my half Sicilian husband thought so too!

this recipe was fairly easy. i only used one egg and could have gotten by on one cup of crumbs -- but i think that all depends on the size/quantity of your pork chops. i'd skip cooking the garlic next time and just add some garlic powder in with the crumbs instead. 

the taste was good, but nothing spectacular.

At first I was intimidated by the number of steps listed in preparing this dish. Then, after the chops had sauteed in the pan, and I put the frying pan in the oven, i realized I had 25 uninterrupted minutes to myself, so I had a glass of wine. SCORE!!!!!

I’ve made these several times. Pork chops are so dry these days that I’d just about given up on making them. The breading does indeed make the pork moist. Do not overlook them. I use a cast iron pan for this recipe. I’ve made them with panko and with regular bread crumbs. Both were successful, just a different texture to the finished product. I like to use canola oil for cooking them, it’s less likely to smoke.

I made this last night using pork loin chops. My wife loved it as she is not a fan of pork. Asked me to keep the recipe for another time. So it is a hit. I cooked them for 2 mins per side and 20 mins in oven at 350 F. Wanted to make sure they stayed moist and not over done and dried out like most people do with pork. It is ok to eat it a bit pink folks.

Probably the best pork I have ever eaten, at home or at a restaurant. I have made these about 5 times now, and they are aways amazing. I use very thick cuts (from Costco) that are nearly 2 inches thick (nearly 5 cm). I think they are best when you first wash the chops well in water and then dry them with a paper towel. Then salt them liberally with a coarse salt and also with freshly ground coarse pepper (salt & pepper all 6 sides of the chops, not just the tops & bottoms) before dipping them in the egg mixture before breading. To avoid the cholesterol, I use a 99% egg white mixture that tastes exactly like eggs with yokes (can buy from most grocery stores; don't buy/use just egg whites). Finally, cook them in the oven for just 20 minutes to keep them amazingly juicy yet still thoroughly cooked. 25 minutes will make them dry. Push gently on their tops to see when they are done (but don't push so hard as to have them loose any internal juices). And perhaps one of the most important instructions is to let them rest in the pan outside of the oven for 5 minutes (to let the juices redistribute from the center of the meat to the entire cut) before plating and serving.

Really good!  The pork chops came out tender and flavorful. My only change was to double coat the meat before browning them.

Turned out picture perfect, just as promised. Only changes I made were to season the meat with some generic Italian seasoning and garlic powder before I dredge with flow, then egg, then bread crumps per recipe. 

This one goes in my recipe box

Loved it! My daughter called them chicken because I also do chicken this way but I corrected her and she loved them and wanted more. My partner loved them as well. This was the first time cooking/baking pork and it was  delicious. I will definitely try this recipe again.

I made it as directed. I wondered why there was so much breading and egg wash leftover. Next time I am going to make at least six to eight pork chops. I used nice, thick pork loin chops, too. They were delectable and so moist! I used my ceramic frying pan that I was able to put in the oven as well. It was the first time. It will be my go to choice for future meat dishes that need to be finished in the oven.

OK I hate doing this....but...will rate as written....then add My Godmother...the best cook on the planet is Polish...husband Italian....so mega recipes in that head of hers.....(they are in their 80's)   Lots of recipes!!!  Anyway, she taught me to do pork chops this way years ago....EXCEPT....once browned, lay them in a corning dish with cover...putting parchment paper in between chops to absorb excess grease....bake at 325 1 - 1 1/2 hours or til fork tender fall apart melt in your mouth status!!! Then you can notch this up to a 5 star   Use nice Thick chops!!

Loved it! My favorite feature of All Recipes is to gather tips/alternatives to each recipe. So, like others, I made a seasoned (salt & pepper) flour mixture first -- dipping each chop in it. Then into the egg/milk batter and finally into the seasoned crumbs. I also used big thick bone-in chops. I then browned them in my favorite good quality garlic oil (so no need to fry up garlic & oil, then discard garlic). Placed them single layer in corning ware and popped into 350 convection oven. Baked for 45 minutes -- perfect! 

Thanks to all of you who offered up tips.

Used thick boneless chops that came out very tender and tasty.  I lost the coating during the browning process, not sure how to avoid that but either way, very tasty. Will try again.

I was looking for a recipe today, New Years Day, to make in addition to the traditional pork n sauerkraut. My children do not care for pork made that way. So...I tried this for the first time and all 3 children devoured them!! This will be a recipe I make again and again. I did not change any ingredients, but I did not add the dried parsley. There was already parsley in my seasoned breadcrumbs.
It's a winner!!!

I too used flour in the breading process. I added a little Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, as well as a little more Parmesan. I used a cast iron skillet with clarified butter rather than olive oil (I typically do this with all recipes).  I scaled the quantity back a bit and used two thick cut chops. Amazing good!

I didn't have an oven-safe skillet so I just kept cooking the pork chops in a pan (covered, at medium-low heat) for about 15 minutes more after having seared each side for 5 minutes. They turned out well!

This dish got great reviews!  Easy and tasty but if I make it again,  I would use at least half of the egg mixture and the breadcrumb mixture.  I ended up wasting so many ingredients.

I had no eggs! So I mixed milk, mayo, and Dijon. Salted and peppers a flour pre-dip mix, and double dipped the chops. Everything else was similar, Parmesan mixed with the bread crumbs, garlic powder verses fresh. I browned and cook at directed and the chops came out superb. Perfectly cooks, wonderful flavor. 

So if your out of egg, you can mix it up and the recipe works just fine - and double coating is alrighty.

I don't remember where I got this recipe but it is a standard at our home. We tweek it a bit as I don't care for so much garlic but it is the same. My daughter puts mozzarella cheese on top of hers the last few minutes and it is excellent as well. This is one of those recipes that you can do many different things with and it turns out well.  Excellent recipe for beginners.  All of my children learned this one as teenagers.

What great flavor - and my whole family loved them. We were all pleasantly surprised at how juicy they were, because pork chops usually come out dry!  I look forward to making this again.  It was a nice twist.

I didn't find this recipe outstanding which would  warrant 5 stars.  I feel there are better pork chop recipes on this site--will probably not make again.

Pretty good, but you don't need so much of the grated cheese & bread crumbs. Two eggs would also be enough. I will make it again, as everyone liked it.

This was easy and tasted great. Will definitely make it again.  I served it with a lemon slice to squeeze over the chop.  Delicious!

Italian Breaded Pork Chops Haiku: "Sad waste of breadcrumbs. 1 and half cups WAY too much. Still, they tasted good." I wish I'd started w/ less breadcrumbs b/c I hated throwing so much of them away; just too much called for here, and I used 3 mega-thick Costco pork chops, covering every inch that I could. (I was also disappointed about tossing those golden garlic hunks too!) I liked the ease of the skillet going straight to the oven for a little less clean-up, but weighing the recipe's prep, ease, taste, appearance, I can't say that I'd bounce at making it again. Very slippery (but still thick and "cakey") breading covered a moist pork chop, sure, but I could've achieved a moist pork chop w/o the breading fuss at all. On the other hand, my daughter and husband raved about theirs and demand that I make it again so I'm on the fence w/ this one!

Vrry quick to get to oven, and great results! Tastes more complex than the few simple ingredients used.  Chops were crunchy outside and moist inside.  I did follow the flour first suggestion and the breeding held tight. Couldn't be more pleased! Thanks for a great pork chop recipe! Salud!

These were pretty good. You have to be very careful not to over cook them though, because if they are overdone, the breading doesn't taste as good and they aren't as moist. I really want to give the method a lot of stars though, because the crust definitely stuck really well! I did dust with flour before dipping in the egg, but other than that I followed the instructions. Also, as others have said, there are way too many eggs and probably too many bread crumbs as well. I used less egg for 8 thin cut chops and still had egg leftover. Start with a little and if you have to, you can always add more, but this way nothing gets wasted. I also added ranch dressing to the egg. That really boosted the flavor and seemed to add quite a bit of moisture. Yummy recipe over all!

It was OK - as far as the amounts - way too much egg wash, way too much breading. I have no idea how the author used so much.

I loved the ease of this recipe, but was a little bit underwhelmed by the outcome.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of double dredging/breading the pork chops.  I used my cast iron skillet so was able to brown them then throw the whole pan in the oven.  Worth another try, but not craving this again immediately.

I made this recipe tonight and it was a big hit!  I followed amounts exactly, except I needed about double the oil to brown the chops (7 came in the package, so I cooked them all and double dipped them in the egg and the bread crumb mixture, after seasoning both sides with salt and pepper.)  They were only about 1/2" thick, and 25 minutes was perfect for that size.  After browning them for 2 min on each side, I baked them on a rack on top of a cookie sheet and there was no issue with grease - they were crisp and perfect.  Next time I might add some garlic salt to the breading mix for a little extra zing. Finally convinced my husband we don't need no stinkin' Shake and Bake!

These are very good. I'd recommend frying them a bit longer in hopes that they are a bit crispier on the outside. But overall, delicious.

Awesome dry rub! The glaze is very acidic. I used scant 1/4 cup of vinegar, 1/2 cup of cherry preserve & 1 tsp of oregano.

I was hoping to love this, but it was just OK. I used 1 egg for dipping and halved all the ingredients for the breading, and it was plenty for 4 large chops. I coated them with flour seasoned with salt and pepper before dipping in egg and then breading. The coating was nice and thick and crispy after baking. The dish really turned out beautiful - it was just the flavor that we didn't love. My family is Italian, but not Sicilian, and I didn't grow up eating pork chops this way. Anything breaded was either veal or chicken. I think my taste buds were just expecting something different than pork with each bite!

I made this recipe exactly as posted.  While it is a good recipe idea, it definitely needed a couple of tweaks.  First of all - the bread crumbs and eggs were wayyyyy too much.  I threw out so much of both dips.  Also - I would add seasonings to the bread crumb mixture next time.  It lacked flavor.  I would add garlic powder as suggested by others and some salt and pepper.  Not sure of the double dipping - that might work too, but mine had plenty of coating.  Baking time was too much.  Mine came out of the oven after 22 minutes and were at 190 degrees already.  Hence, they were a bit tough.  I fried and baked mine in a cast iron skillet and that worked perfectly.  I will try again with these changes.

Same as my Sicilian family recipe! Love it.  Can also be used on skinless chicken.. any piece, just adjust baking time.   Breading can be done up to a day in advance too.

The chop was moist but the coating on the bottom was soggy while the top was not as crispy as I was hoping for. Followed the directions to the letter so not sure what went wrong since everyone else feels this is a great recipe.  Gordon

It was ok just not my thing. Pork chops were very most though. Felt like they needed something added. . i had some bourbon glaze so i heated that up and dipped chops in it. Hubby said dont cook it again. . Def too much egg wash and too much breading mixture. Could have used 2 eggs w 2 T milk and 1/2 the breading mix. Wasteful to make so much IMO.

These pork chops were awesome. I never ever cooked pork chops. Tried these and they turned out really good and my family cleaned their plates. 

Followed recipe, but as other reviews suggested, i drenched chops in flour before egg bath. I did bake for 20 mins and desired temperature was met.

Very tasty and juicy.  None of us are fans of pork chops, but we all love. This is the only way I make them now.  So tender. I usually don't have sides together in time and end up cooking longer, but at that low temperature, they don't get overcooked.  I usually flip them so one side not overdone, but the last time I made, I took someone's advice and covered with foil while in oven, then uncovered last 10 minutes.  I too cut back on egg and milk - one egg and one TBSP milk works (or two egg whites and two TBSP milk). Also reduced bread crumbs to 1 c., cheese to 1/4 c. and parsley in half, which is plenty for four thick pork chops. Thank you!

My wife made this recipe for some 2 inch thick pork chops as well as the regular cut -- both were soooo tender and delicious!! Great recipe!

The 2 inch chops were in the freezer for several months (bought from Costco), go to say with this recipe I will not hesitate to buy thick chops again!

This was not bad... But somewhat bland. Followed the recipe nearly to a 'T', but it REALLY needs some enhanced flavor of some sort. I'm still confused as to why the directions say to sauté the garlic then set aside for "another use"? Wasted garlic doing that... But these need some garlic or onion salt, before coating with the egg wash. The coating was great- so was cooking time. They did come out near perfect, only thing lacking was flavor, as they really were quite bland. I also think this recipe calls for WAY too much eggs/bread crumbs! Wasted about 2 eggs & nearly a cup of bread crumbs. I would suggest using only 1-2 eggs & 3/4 cup bread crumbs, along with adding some onion or garlic salt pre-egg wash on the chops before coating & cooking. One thing I did different, and am glad, was throwing the chops back in the bread crumb mix after browning them on the frying pan, before placing them in the oven. They would have come out quite soggy & even more bland if I had not thought to re-coat with the bread crumb mixture before baking. Otherwise, this was a nice change in pace for pork chops! We did enjoy it, but just felt it could have used more flavor. And the cooking time was pretty spot-on... Any longer & they would have been much too dry. So we will keep this & make it again, just adding a few changes to spices/flavoring next time.

I did what the recipe said, with minor adjustment with the frying time. I browned the pork for about 2 to 3 mins each side. It turned out good! I wish it had an added recipe for sauce though.

This recipe is awesome.  I only added afew more things to the recipe.  A Lil onion powder  and garlic powder  to the breading.  I dipped it in flour first before the egg.  And when I browned up the garlic I left it in the pan when I cooked the chops.  And then I put the chops on a baking sheet in the oven.  Instead of my skillet.  That's it.  And it was beyond  delicious.  Thanx.

Fantastic recipe!! The only thing that I have ever been good at doing with pork chops is deep frying them and I really wanted a somewhat healthier option. This was great! It had the crispy breaded outside that I like but not all the greasy! I seasoned the naked chops with season salt(lightly), garlic powder and a little Italian seasoning. That with the bread crumbs and Parmesan was soooooo flavorful! I will definitely do thus one again!

I found this recipe searching for Baked Pork Chops because our grill is still buried in snow, and it's cold!  I wanted something interesting to eat and fun to make, and this fit the bill.  I had never breaded a pork chop before.  Strangely, I'm not sure I'd even eaten one before.
Following suggestions from several reviewers, I used only 2 eggs and 1 cup bread crumbs.  We had 6 small chops, and there was plenty of egg mixture and breading.
We didn't have seasoned bread crumbs (we always process and toast the ends of bread loaves and keep them in the freezer), so I added the equivalent of 2 tsp Italian Seasoning and 1 tsp garlic powder.
I had expected a bit more flavor, but the result was very good.  Next time, I'll put pressed garlic into the breading mixture instead of browning it in the oil.  The flavor in the oil just didn't seem to come through.  I will also add some salt to the breading, probably 1/2 tsp.
Our teenager actually ate 3 of the pork chops; that's huge praise! We will definitely be making this again.

I follow the recipe and the chop had a good flavor. Next time I will add some garlic  and onion powder to the dry mix 
The only thing different is I used thin cut boneless pork loin chops and pounded them out then. when pounding out meat lay a piece of plastic wrap over to keep it from splattering. It will make them  tender.

I followed this recipe exactly and OMG, so flavorful. This was my first time using Italian bread crumbs and I thought it would be to overpowering of a taste but it was absolutely delicious. Best part is it's so easy this is something that I can easily whip up.

Very good! I can't wait to make this again. Easy and delicious. The chops were so tender and I always have had issues with pork chops being too dry. Very appetizing in apperance too. NO leftovers this night. 5 stars!

I would make this again. I covered the meat in flour first, followed the rest of the directions except i added garlic powder to the bread crumbs (Panko with italian seasoning) and didn't do the frying step- just baked it for 30 minutes. It was not as flavourful as we had hoped, we added a smidge of salt at the table and it was enjoyable.

I coated the pork chops in a mixture of all-purpose flour, salt and pepper, before coating them in the egg wash, and I used Japanese Panko bread crumbs instead of Italian. I also believe (can't remember for sure) I used oregano in place of parsley (my husband doesn't like the taste of parsley), and I also think I added a touch of sage to the bread crumb mix. I made them once with the olive oil, but only had vegetable oil the second time and they still came out fine. And I didn't measure seasonings or oil. I put them in the oven on 375 for about 6 minutes after browning well on stove to ensure being cooked in the middle. (Of course I still made sure). The coating stayed on beautifully and the pork chops were nice and tender.

This was a good base recipe...I jazzed it up by serving cooked tomato slices on top. I sprinkled tomato slices with Parmesan, salt, pepper, oregano and olive oil and cooked them in the oven, with the chops, for about 10 mins. Divine!!

VERY good. I did as others suggested and did a light dusting of flour first, then egg/milk, then crumb/cheese mixture. I had an assembly line going with my kids, one dusted each side with the flour, handed it off to the next who dipped the chop into the egg, then handed it to me so I could dip in the crumbs and place in the pan. Very cool :) The breading stayed on the chops and while it was crunchy, it was moist and tender on the inside. My husband said it's his favorite pork chop dish thus far! I made 7 chops this way, 3 were thicker, just under an inch, 4 were fairly thin, ALL were wonderful! I just made them in separate pans to account for the slight difference in cooking time.

I enjoyed this recipe, although I think it makes way more breading than what I needed.  I used boneless, thick-cut chops and had way too much breading left over.  I didn't fry the chops in oil, but instead just gave the pans a light spray to make it healthier. I also did a flour, salt, and pepper dredge, before I coated the chops twice with egg and breading.  I didn't bother with the garlic either and they turned out great--very tender and moist, with a crispy coating!  I will make these again sometime soon!

I tried this recipe and it was very easy to make. I usually stay away from pork chops since they tend to become dry but, not with this recipe the pork chops were juicy and flavorful. My pork chops were on the big side so it took them longer to bake than the stated time. My boyfriend keeps asking me when am I going to cook them again. This one is a keeper

Only used 2 tenderized pork cutlets (2 diners) and floured before egg wash. Uses half Italian bread crumbs and half Panko, adding extra Italian seasoning and garlic powder with the cheese. Since these were thin and tender I only needed to brown in oil in my cast iron skillet maybe 7-8 minutes per side over med-high heat to start, then lowering to med. no need to heat up the oven and the were perfect. Used canola oil. Served with sautéed kale and white beans recipe from Allrecipes and sliced tomatoes.

By far the best recipe for breaded pork chops. I have made it several times and its just great! The secret for the breading to hold is to let the chops rest for 15 minutes after breading them.

These are great. Thick boneless chops were tender, moist and flavorful. Only changes were using garlic flavored oil, no salt seasoning, dredging in Wondra flour and double dipping in egg mixture and Italian crumbs.

Delicious.  Browning the chops in the pan with garlic first sealed the deal on these chops.  They were so good, and very moist.  Very flavorful.  I used Italian seasoned Panko crumbs instead of traditional crumbs- and it was great.

After almost 20 years of marriage I finally found a recipe for pork chops my husband not only liked but raved about. He dislikes pork chops since they tend to be dry.  These came out moist.  I  floured the chops before dipping them and used garlic salt since I didn't have any garlic on hand. I also cooked them on the stove top but will try them in the oven next time.  Thank you for a great and easy recipe. Now I can buy pork chops again.

I found this recipe to be slightly bland. I used quality bread crumbs and cheese so I thought that there would be plenty of sodium and I even added some salt and pepper to the raw pork chops before the egg wash and there was still a lot of flavor missing. Needs garlic/onion salt or a kick of something.

It was edible, but I won't keep the leftovers or make them this way again.  It was very bland, and I had even seasoned the meat with a bit salt and pepper before breading them. I should have gone with my instinct and hit them with Tony's.  The meat turned out tender enough, the crust was firm enough, but they had a bit of a "bready" taste to it.  A lot of prep for just a so-so dish.

I floured the chops first, then followed the recipe as written. Like others said, there was way too much egg/milk mixture, and also way too much of the breading mixture leftover. But this one is a keeper! My roommate usually wants some kind of gravy or sauce over his pork chops, but he loved this one made as directed! Will definitely make again!

I have made this 3 times now, and all 3 times it has turned out tender, flavorful pork chops.  Suggestions I would make:  If you don't have fresh garlic, just add garlic powder to taste to the bread crumb mixture, and secondly, this makes a large amount of bread crumb mixture.  I just made it tonight, and coated 10 large pork chops with bread crumbs left over.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe for pork chops!  The breading made almost twice as much as I needed, and could have gotten by with 2 eggs for sure.  I had three large chops almost 2'' thick. 
Definitely used the suggestion from other commenters and placed chops in flour first, then egg mixture, then italian coating.  Created a thick coating that stuck amazingly well@
Also, I did not remove the garlic (pressed mine) but just pan fried the chops on top the garlic, no problem.  Then transfered chops to a glass baking dish to bake in the oven.  Worked with no issues at all.  Very moist and tasty!

These were great! Like many others I dredged the pork chops in flour. I also added garlic powder to the bread crumbs. I'm not usually the biggest fan of pork chops, but i loved these! They are also very easy to make.

Love the hint about flour first before the egg wash and bread crumbs!  Really kept these little babies crispy.  Three eggs really is too many, as many other reviewers noted.  Used more than 2 TBSP olive oil.  Did not measure the bread crumbs and sprinkled with mixed seasoning before flouring and continuing with the breading and cooking.  Did not keep in the skillet in the oven, but placed on a rack as advised by another reviewer.  Just like fried without the effort and juicy and tender and, most importantly, the breading stayed put!  Thanks for sharing.

Really good!  Whole family liked.  Will try the flour suggestion next time to see if breading will stay on better.  Used 2 eggs and about 5 T. milk, and 1 cup panko crumbs, as suggested in other reviews, as well as sprinkling on some garlic salt and pepper first.

LOVED this, and so did my husband. The only thing is for the amount of egg mixture and bread crumbs, you could bread a lot more than 4 pork chops. I did 6 and had a LOT to spare.

This recipe is so simple and easy, yet delicious. I enjoy making this everytime, eventhough I am always nervous about cooking pork. I cut down on the Parmesan, as I do not think is that necessary and is my own way to cut down on cost.

I agree with the other posters, way too many eggs and bread crumbs! I find regular Italian bread crumbs to be too overly seasoned, so I used plain panko flakes and half a packet of Italian Seasoned salad dressing (the dry stuff). The breading was delicious, but it slid off the pork. Chops were a medium thickness. browned 8 minutes total, baked 15 in the oven and were perfect.

I'm not a great cook.  That being said, you have to understand that when my husband is thrilled with one of my meals, it MUST be good. I've always been afraid of cooking porkchops because of the tendency to either under- or overcook them.  This recipe is PERFECT.  The only things I had to change were that I didn't have breadcrumbs, so I used crushed Italian croutons, and I didn't have fresh garlic, so before I dipped the chops in the egg mixture, I lightly sprinkled with garlic salt.  These were definitely a hit!

My family loves this recipe.  I did make a few minor changes, adding more seasoning and omitting the cheese and it was great.  I also did this recipe using boneless chicken thighs and it was just as good.  This has now become a regular in my home.

These were ok but not great.  I didn't use parmesan cheese so maybe that made a difference.  They also turned out dry.  For the amount of time to double dip in flour and bread crumbs - I think it would be easier to use "Oven Fry for Pork" and get the same results and that is why I gave it 3 stars.

I am making them for the third time tonight. My husband loves this recipe. I also dregde in flour with salt and pepper first. I was already using the oven when I made these the first time, so I just made them on the stove and I am making them the same way tonight. Why change what already works! My husband rarely cares what we eat for dinner so when he requested this one again I knew it was a keeper!

I made this for my mom and sister.  They fell in love with it!  I did roasted broccoli, red potatoes and sauted baby carrots.  The pork chops were so tender and juicy that you didn't feel full!  It goes great with a red wine!  My sister gave me a 9.5 out of 10.  I must have done somethin right!!!

Amazing!!!
I normally marinate my pork chops but wanted to try something different I followed the recipe i did not add the cheese my husband is allergic and also i pan cooked vs bakeing in the oven because i do not have a oven ready skillet. My family went crazy they said it was the best they have ever tasted i was super impressed! Great reciepe i will be making this again soon:)

Wow, this recipe was FABULOUS! We ate it with a side of spaghetti and salad. We thought that this batter would go great with veal or chicken also. Super Simple! :)

These were  just "average" to me. Nothing really  wrong with them but no real wow factor. Perfectly fine for weeknight family dinners but would not be my first choice to serve company. I've definitely had better pork chops. Thank you for posting.

Excellent Pork Chops.  The ONLY thing I did differently was to leave the garlic in the pan while cooking the chops.  (Obviously, we love garlic)

Very yummy - I did follow other reviewers suggestions and cut egg to one and used shake and bake method of coating chops. I skipped the milk and over entirely and they turned out great

This is my new go-to pork chop recipe.  We love it!  It's quick, easy and most of us probably have the ingredients at the ready.  One note, you probably will not need 3 eggs.  I use one egg and one tablespoon of milk for three pork chops.  Enjoy!

I like recipes that are easy to remember - this one fits the bill.  After the first time I made it, and enjoyed it, I can whip it up any time.  Chops turn out wonderfully moist.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Wow.  This were probably the best chops I've ever made.  Per other reviews, I double dipped the chops and they came out great.  My husband devoured his, then ate the few scraps of meat left on the bone on mine chop.

This was a delicious recipe!  The pork chops were so tender and juicy!  I did, however, only put the chops in the oven for about 12 minutes.  20 minutes would have dried them out.  I used pork chops that were about 1/2 inch in thickness, so maybe the 20 minutes was for a thicker cut.  Also, I omitted the garlic as it seemed like a waste to cook it and set it aside for another use.

Very tasty recipe. The dip and breading made enough to cover 12 chops.
After the initial cook time, I broiled on each side for 2 minutes for a bit of added crispiness.

This was so good!  Even my 3-year-old fussy daughter ate it, saying "mmmm" with each bite!  My husband also commented how good it was.  I followed others' advice by using 2 eggs and 2 tbsp milk and it was plenty.  Fast, easy, yummy - this recipe will definitely be repeated!

This was really easy to make and was quite delicious.  Although, I felt that 1 1/2 cups of crumbs was a bit wasteful. I used 1 tablespoon of parsley instead of two and fried it over medium heat. My family and I enjoyed the chops, thanks a lot for sharing!

So great!  I only used 1 egg and had plenty.  Then I finished it in the oven on a cooling rack on a cookie sheet.  It was super crisp and delish!  My kids inhaled it and wanted more.  I will definately make again

Watch the chops when they are browning, I cooked them for 4 mins, and they were starting to burn.  I used one egg, 1 Tb milk, and it was the perfect amount.  I also used one cup of breading.  Finished them off in the oven with roasted apsaragus, and served it with rice.  Yummy!

My hubby is so tired of pork chops & not happy I was making them for dinner. BUT he tasted these & he loved them! He even told me to make sure I write the recipe down in my Keepsake Recipe Book!! (big compliment)  I followed the recipe exactly. Here's a BIG PLUS: my hubby works nights and this recipe reheats perfectly in the microwave. The pork does NOT dry out nor does it get tough in the reheating process. And our 5 year old picky eater cleaned his plate! I served it with green beans the Alfredo Sauce (over Penne) by B. Mason I got from here. Very rarely are all 3 of us very happy with the same dinner!

The breading is amazing! Absolutely loved it. Very flavourful. Next time I use this breading though, I will use it on chicken breasts. I am sure it will be even better!

These were good, but not great, and I do think the baking time is way too long.  After browning, my chops were practically done, so 15 minutes in the oven did it for me.  I also think these could use more seasoning.  There just isn't enough in the Italian bread crumbs.

This was really easy and really good.  I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I just added Italian seasoning (about a TBS) to the bread crumb mix.  I'll definitely make it again.

Yum! This was really good, I followed advice from others and used flour with salt and pepper before the egg mixture.  I made my own bread crumbs with some leftover bread I had.  Also to make it slightly more Italian I added some pesto sauce on top before sticking them into the oven.  Served with cous cous and zucchini. Great Recipe!

These were good pork chops. I only used 2 eggs and 2 tbsp of milk. I also only used 2/3 of the breading mix and it was more than enough. They browned beautifully and had a lot more flavor compared to just breaded chops. I'll make this again!

I made these with thin pork cutlets and it was a hit with the family.  Maybe not the healthiest way to eat pork chops/cutlets, but definately the tastiest.

These pork chops were delicious!!!! I also made some adjustments. First I seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper, then coated them with flour, then egg and milk and finally with the bread crumbs mix. Loved it!!!

Delicious!  I cut up my boneless pork chops into nugget-size pieces for easier handling and added french fried onions chopped into the breading.  Cooked them in the skillet about a minute or two each side then for 15-20 minutes in the oven on a foil lined baking sheet.  Came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Big hit with my 8 year old son who had leftovers for breakfast.

I dredged the chops in flour before the egg mixture and then cooked on a rack pan.  I also added a little garlic to the breading, definitely could have added more though.  Had tons of breading and egg mixture leftover.  Next time will cut both of those back.

This recipe was "just okay" for my family.  It's probably my own fault..as I never have luck with pork chops.  The breading was tasty.

I used boneless chops so I cut the cooking time down. I used other suggestions and seasoned the chops first, dipped in flour then egg mix then the bread crumb. After baking they were a little soggy so I threw them back in the skillet for a minute and they were great. Thanks for the recipe.

I made as directed.  I did cut back on the bread crumbs by 1/2 cup, but could have cut back more for the 4 chops I made.  I used thick chops and they came out very moist and tender.  Very good!

Very good pork chops. First, as another reviewer suggested, I used only 2 eggs and about a cup of bread crumbs. This was plenty. Then, like another reviewer said, I added about a tsp each of garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture. Also, as another reviewer suggested, I first coated the chops with a flour, salt and pepper mixture - then in the egg wash and then in the bread crumb mixtures. This made the breading thick and it stuck to the chops very well. For both the flour coating and the bread crumb mixture, I used resealable bags and did the 'shake-n-bake' thing which made it so easy to do and to clean up. Overall this was a tasty, quick and easy recipe.

this recipe is great!!!! this is the first time i have ever wrote a review on a recipe. i did only use 2 eggs. added more parmesean(love it) and instead of fresh garlic i used garlic powder(my husband doesnt like fresh garlic). i put pork chops in a glass casserole dish too. would be a great breading for veal too.

Made this last night for my husband and brother in law and it was a hit! I also put flour on pork chops before dipping them in the egg wash. I used pork chops that were already sliced very thin so didn't put them in the oven and just fried them. They were also good the next day with bread and turned them into "tortas"

I followed the recipe with very few modifications.  Only used 2 eggs and 2 tbsp milk.  Dreged the chops in flour as others suggested.  Used plain bread crumbs (all I had on hand) with a tablespoonful of Italian seasoning.  Everything else was the same as written.  Turned out beautiful.  My husband said to definitly have these again.  Thanks for a keeper.

So good! I did dredge them in seasoned flour before dipping them in the egg wash like other reviewers suggested. I also sliced my garlic. This recipe was very good. Family loved them! Thanks for a great recipe! And I did not find them greasy.

I made these as a change to grilled pork chops (the way we usually make them) They had good flavor but to me nothing beats a Pork Chop off the grill. Will make again if I need a change of pace.

This is great exactly as written.  One thing that I now do with my chops is to by a whole loin and have my butcher slice it and then run it through the cuber.  Fork cutting tender results!!!

These were the best pork chops nice and crisp on the outside and the italian season bread crumbs gave it a great flavor and the meat was so tender and juicy!  A great side to serve with these is Butternut squash fries. Looking forward to making these again!

I love this recipe!!   I've always had difficulty making pork chops that don't end up very dry.   I used boneless thin cut chops so they were pretty much done by the time they were browned, but I put them in the oven briefly just to reheat before serving.   I'm going to try it with chops cut to the normal thickness and finish cooking in the oven per the recipe.   My husband and I loved them!  Very tasty, tender and juicy! And better yet, really quick and easy to make.   Definitely a keeper!

Followed this recipe to a "T" and it was incredible.  My kids who normally don't like pork chops for some reason, LOVED these.  I think the garlic used to season the oil really made a difference.

What a great way to prepare pork chops! My boyfriend, who usually hates pork because he thinks it is dry, liked these and devoured the leftovers the next day. I made a half recipe and only change I made was to substitute some of the Italian bread crumbs with panko. Highly recommend.

We tried this recipe using modifications from the most helpful review which indicated to pan fry for 5 minutes, then put on a rack and bake.   Personally, I found this recipe to be very bland, and the chops did not come out just as crispy baked.   The breading was soggy.    Also, you have to be careful not to overbake.  My husband made this and baked it for the time indicated and they came out very dry and tough.  Personally, I like more kick, so I would add salt, pepper, paprika and cayenne pepper to the coating.   Will try it again with modifications.

These are delicious pork chops.  I made them as the recipe states.  I did have a ton of left over bread crumb mixture.  Next time I would half that.

These were nice and tender, but the taste was really nothing special.  I did follow the advice of others and dredge them in flour before the egg dip and it did help to keep the breading on and enable it to get crispy.  A good base recipe that can probably be worked with in many ways.

Kids and hubby gobbled it up and it was quick & easy to make, so definitely 5 stars for a family meal.  Didn't have oven proof skillet so cooked in oven on a greased cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet.  Worked out great.  Only complaint is that I had 5 boneless chops and there was enough breading for almost twice that.

These were delicious.  I used another reviewer's advice and dredged the chops in flour first, and I made my own italian seasoned breadcrumbs because I didn't have store-bought ones.  They were gobbled up in our house.

This is a really great recipe.  I did bastardize it a bit though.  I had no Italian bread crumbs, so instead I used corn meal and added liberal amounts of Club House Italiano seasoning.  I didn't have pork chops but rather 5 cuts of fast fry pork with the bone in.  They were thinner than your average pork chop, which I think worked nicely.  I pre-seasoned the cuts with the Italiano seasoning.  I sprinkled some freshly cracked peppercorns in the egg/milk mixture and only used 2 eggs - which was still more than plenty.  I also sliced the garlic cloves for easier removal from the oil (as per another reviewer's suggestion).    Definitely a keeper!

Very good recipe.  My family enjoyed these pork chops.  They came out very juicy.  I did take the advice of others and cut the bread crumb mixture in half and I still had some left over.   Thanks I will probably make them again.

these are very tasty and easy to make!  I dredge mine through flour before dipping them in the eggs though.  They always come out perfect and delicious even for me, who doesn't neccasarily like porkchops.  My husband loves them!

DELICIOUS!!!! The only thing I changed is that I cut the breadcrumb mixture in half and still had a ton left over. I used the garlic for mashed potatoes after browning. This was a HUGE hit, even with my finicky 3-year-old.

Great recipe. I didn't have any eggs, so I dipped my chops in some ranch dressing, which I diluted slightly with a tablespoon or two of water. But I first followed some of the other reviewers and coated the chops with flour that I seasoned, dipped them into the ranch, then coated with the Italian bread crumb mixture. Since the bread crumbs tend to burn easily, I suggest cutting the browning time to about 2 1/2 - 3 minutes on each side, then place in the oven for 20 minutes, and flip them after 10 minutes.

tastes excellent! one of the best meals i've made this month. For the recipe, you only need about half the said amount of breading. a sprinkling of lime juice on is a great way to change it up.  i give it five stars for taste, four stars because the recipe calls for too much breading (awfully wasteful)

I made this tonight and used the rack method and the chops turned out wonderfully. I had to omit the cheese as I was out and added about a tablespoon of ranch dressing mix to the bread crumbs. I also dredged in flour before the egg mixture as someone had previously suggested. I will be using this method from now on.

I've been making this for years, but often add an extra kick to it. Want to make this again but even better? Marinade the chops in "Chipotle". You can buy these powder marinades at any grocery store and make the mix. Once you marinade for the required time (15 min) then follow the regular recipe (breadcrumbs, etc). My husband could eat this every week if I allowed him too. DELICIOUS!!! The Chipotle flavor is an unexpected but added flavor.

This is the first dish I tried from this website....it was SOOOO easy to make, soooo good and my boyfriend, who is a big eater, loved it! I had 6 slim pork chops so the 3 eggs and 11/2 cups of bread crumbs was too much but I saved the leftovers for the next time!

YUM, Very Good! I had boneless porkchops, so I used those and instead of regular eggs for coating, I used egg beaters (I think the breading sticks to the meat better when I use them). I don't have an oven-proof skillet, so after browning, I just popped them onto a cookie sheet and they were good to go. They only had to cook maybe 15 mins. or so. These were VERY flavorful and my whole family enjoyed them. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Easy and delicious! I kept the garlic in the skillet when I added the pork chops.  Also, I do not own an oven-proof skillet, so I transferred the pork chops to a baking dish before placing in the oven.  Worked out great.

This was a delicious dish.  We do not tend to eat a lot of pork in our house and it was a great change of pace.  I used bone in chops and they were very juicy and flavorful.  I would definately make again!

My husband and I thought these were very good.  What a nice flavor the chops had and they were very juicy.  Per other reviews I did the following:  2 eggs, 2 T. lt cream (didn't have any milk) 1 cup Italian Panko breadcrumbs, 1 cup grated Parmesan/Romano cheese, 1 T. parsley. I had 6 chops, sprinkles with pepper, mixed the other ingredients in a zip lock bag and added 3 chops at a time to coat. Added oil to the pan and sprinkled garlic powder and onion flakes into the skillet.  Added the chops and fried on each side for about 3 mins.  Placed in a pan and baked for 30 mins. Makes a great meal.

This recipe is amazing. I needed something more interesting to do with pork and this was the answer I was looking for.  It is so simple and yet tastes so good.  My husband loves it too - so much so that he asked me to show him how to make it.  I agree that the egg wash mixture is too much unless you double dip the pork (which I tried once but I prefer single dipping!) Other than that this has become a favourite.

This was fantastic!  I made it as read, except I would reduce the egg/milk and bread crumb/cheese mixture next time; there was way too much of it that just went to waste.  You could probably cut it in half.  Other than that, delicious!  I served with applesauce but maybe a side of pasta with tomato sauce would've been better, or you could just top the chops with a nice marinara.

I just made these.  I cooked them in a cast iron skillet which wanted to pull the breading off the chops.. Then after I baked two, the top side was crunchy while the bottom was greasy.  The other two I fried and they tasted the same but more crunchy.  As other reviewers noted, cut the eggs and breading down.. way too much.. Also, don't use a cast iron skillet, dries up too fast... If baking, maybe put them on a rack so they don't get soggy.. Other than that, it's a good basic breaded chop recipe and I will try it again with a few changes

Terrific recipe. I dredged them through flour and added a little garlic salt to the bread crumb mixture. Very tasty, my entire family loved them! I use a very similar recipe for my chicken cutlets.

These were good~I am not sure why you couldn't just brown them and then transfer to a baking dish to the oven though. I did add a tiny bit of water about half way through cooking time because the oil had dried up and I was afraid the chops would burn. Very tasty!!!

Very good! Will make again. Followed recipe as written and will only use half the egg & the breadcrumbs and cheese next time as it was way to much for 6 boneless pork loins.

AMAZING! I followed the recommendations to coat with flour and halve the amount of eggs used to soak the pork chops prior to coating in bread crumbs. Have made the recipe multiple times after my guests loved it at my dinner party.

I thought these were just ok but my husband really liked it.  I actually doubled dipped the pork chop and cooked them in an iron skillet.  They were not soggy.  I thought they were a little bland though.  I think this is a good base but it needs something more.

Good! I found the pork chops themselves to be a bit bland, though I did season them before breading. I used 2 pork chops and only one egg, which was plenty. I coated the chops with a thin layer of flour before dipping in the egg and breadcrumns.  All in all, a tasty recipe. Thanks! :)

Wonderful recipe- my husband and I loved it. We will do pork this way from now on! I ended up with WAY too much egg wash and breading even after double breading. Next time I will only use 1 egg and 1T milk and cut back on the bread crumbs.

Delicious pork chops, thanks for the recipe. I did not have Ital seasoned bread crumbs, so I added oregano and thyme. Broiled them in the oven, turned out very moist and tender.

I used two eggs because mine were extra-large and I thinned out the mixture with a little more milk. I used my own homemade breadcrumbs and added a tbsp. of italian seasoning. Before baking, I sprinkled paprika over the top. Very simple and unpretentious.

My family of picky eaters loved this dish the only thing I would suggest is to cut the cooking time way back if you are using a thinner pork chop (I was and they turned out a little dry) Everyone really liked them though which was a plus for me I will definitely make these again!

Good, but not great.  I usually use Italian breadcrumbs when I cook, so they did not add a special flavor for us.  These were just baked, breaded chops.

2 changes: doubled the recipe so that we could have left overs and used fresh parsley rather than dried as that was what we had on hand.  These turned out to be fabulous.  My whole apartment smelled wonderful while they were cooking and lingered - always a plus.

We really liked this.  I used panko bread crumbs.  Next time I think I will cook it in the oven for about 5 minutes less than the recipe stated.  It was quite good!  So far it's one of my favorite pork chop recipes!

growing up my mom didn't like pork chops so she never made them for us. after i got married my hubby requested chops for dinner and i was totally clueless on how to make them so i turned to my fave website- and it never lets me down! these are wonderful! now we have pork chops at least once a month! i do scale back on the breadcrumb mixture as there is lots that goes into the trash when i'm done as it's written. other than that i follow it word for word!

Operator error: hubby says not crispy enough, but I tried to bake in a skillet that wasn't big enough. The chops were huge and as a result, not all sides were crispy. Used half panko and half Italian bread crumbs. Will try again if I cut the chops in half first.

Oh yummm, these turned out so well!  Normally I buy a pre-seasoned pork chop from Walmart that comes in a little baking tray (a cop out, I know) but they didn't have any so I was a bit nervous buying them plain.  I've never attempted to do anything other than fry them before but these were absolutely delicious!!!  I sauteed some onion and mushroom for the top. I will definitely make these again, a keeper for sure.  Update:  I must've had a lot more pork chops the first time I made these.  This was my 2nd time making them, I had 4 pork chops and ended up with so much coating and egg mixture left.  I only used 2 eggs but still had leftover, I ended up scrambling them and my fiance ate them in a sandwich.  Definitely cut back on the coating if you're only using 4 chops.  Still a 5 star recipe IMO tho!

These were great but did feel a litle too Italian for our taste. Pehaps because I switched to Italian Seasonings as I did not have Basil on hand. Maybe should stick ot it next time!

I make this with a few variations but it's the parmesan cheese that makes it great! One big difference I do is cover mine with mayo then coat them with the cheese/bread crumb mix.

I made this for my skeptical husband and he was surprisingly happy. He couldn't stop talking about how much he loved it. I made a couple of changes like seasoning the chops with salt, black pepper, Italian seasonings and garlic powder before coating it with the breadcrumb mixture.  I served it with a creamy fettucini alfredo which compimented the chops really well.

This was a new twist for me to make pork chops...I found that I really did not need 3 eggs...or 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs....I also did not have dried parsley so I used the fresh flat leaf I had in the frig...I served it with a fresh made red sauce / pasta and fresh veggies....overall a good dish I will try again...It was a good jumping off point....Yum

The only thing I changed was adding a little salt and pepper to the bread crumbs and after cooking the garlic in the oil, I left it in so it ended up in the breading of the pork chops. This was a huge hit in my house.

I tried this recipe several times- the first time it was good- better than any porkchop I had ever had... but then the next few times, I altered it a bit and it was tasty, but the breading fell off or they were dried out.  This last time, I followed the recipe to the letter- and they were perfect.  The first thing was I didn't have an oven proof frying pan, so I bought one AND I followed the 25 minutes exactly- before I had used a meat thermometer and by the time it reached the suggested temp, they were dry.  Get a good pan and follow the recipe- you will not be dissapointed.  Thank you!!!!

The is the only way I cook porkchops now.  The parmesian cheese is optional, but it's also the ingredient that makes this recipe change from being great to excellent.  I think these would taste great with a marinara dipping sauce too.

Very good.  I dredged in egg, then flour, then egg, and then the bread crumb mixture. The coating stuck to the chop really well.  Remember to add salt and pepper to your flour before dredging. You can cut back to 2 eggs and 1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs. We have always enjoyed pork chops made with a shake and bake coating.  This is far better.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good recipe. I did change it a little bit..I didn't use the milk and instead of chopping the garlic and removing it, I minced in and left it while browning the pork chops. They were delicious!!!

Over the past many years, I have tried to make coated fried chicken or pork, only to have it be burnt on the outside while raw on the inside.  This cooking method works - crispy on the outside, cooked inside, moist and good flavor!  I am so pleased to find a recipe that actually works!!

These were very tasty, since I didnt have a pan that could go from the stove to the oven I just left the garlic in which added a ton of great flavor.  I had to cook a lot longer in the oven since I had pretty thick tenderloin slices but it was crispy and flavorful enough!  My kids even ate it!

I dreged my pork first in flour, salt and pepper before dipping in the egg. Helped keep it moist. My oven tends to cook faster than normal, but the cooking time on this recipe still might be a few mins long. Suggest keeping a watch on your meal with a meat thermometer.

Is it too early to review?  They are baking now and the house smells incredible.  They were easy and the ingredients are healthy.  They look amazing and I have never been prouder of my cast iron skillet as it slid from stovetop to oven without disturbing the crusty chops.  I can not wait to dig in!!!

I was very excited to try this recipe since it had so many good reviews, but it did not really deliver.  I had far too much egg & milk mixture and parmesan & bread crumb mixture left over...half would have been more than plenty.  Then there was too much olive oil.  As a result, the pork chops came out soggy after being in the oven.  Next time, if I ever make this again, I will definitely cut the oil in half as well.  Could have used a little salt and black pepper to season it up a bit more too.

This was very good ! I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used normal bread crumbs and seasoned them with 2 teaspoons dried basil, 2 teaspoons dried marjoram, 2 teaspoons dried oregano and 1 teaspoon dried sage. I also used 2 eggs and 2 tablespoons milk instead of 3 and it was enough. Finally I left the garlic whole because its easier to remove. Will definitely do these again !

Terrific recipe!  Quick & super easy, all the ingredients needed I already had at home so I didn't need to make a stop to the store to make it!  I made this last night and it was a hit with my fiancé.  I added some Italian seasoning to the chops while they were in the pan frying.  I think next time I will double coat them as others have suggested.  I’ll be making this again very soon…

These were very tasty. The only problem I had was that I didn't have bread crumbs so I made my own out of stale, toasted bread seasoned with Italian seasonings. The problem with this is that the breading didn't stay on (even with the addition of flour before the eggs). It was still tasty.

This recipe was great,infact i have used the recipe at work when catering a function. Instead of adding the garlic i used home made garlic infused olive oil, it took all the hassle out and had more of a garlicy taste to it, Reccomended to all garlic lovers.

Yummy! As others have said, I found the egg mix and bread crumb mix to be a bit excessive, so I would cut that down and add a bit more olive oil. I'm not a very adept cook yet, so if I can make this anyone can.

Very good - but you only need 2 eggs and about a cup of bread crumbs (even if you double dip).
Can put in any oven proof pan - I did for 20 minutes and it turned out good.
Not exactly the healthy way to make pork chops - but very tasty.

YUM!  Didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I just did regular homemade crumbs (toast slices of bread in toaster then grind in blender or food processor).  Then added 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon sugar and pinch of oregano to one cup of bread crumbs.  I kept the pressed garlic in the olive oil and we are garlic lovers.  Next time I'll use a bit less oil.  This is FANTASTIC!!!

These chops were great! I made a few changes. I salt and peppered the chops before dipping them into the egg/milk mixture. Before I placed them into the oven I added about 3/4 cup of chicken broth into the cast iron and put the lid on. I took the lid off for the last 8 minutes. The temp of the chops registered at about 150. I Removed and tented the chops from the pan and made a water gravy for my rice. So yummy!

This recipe reminded me of being a kid and making breaded chicken with my mother. It was just as good on the pork chops. I didn't quite get the use of browning the garlic and then removing it from the pan, so i would probably skip that next time. I double breaded, and also drizzled a little bit of melted butter over the chops before putting them in the oven. Absolutely delicious!

This was very good. My only complaint was the extra egg & bread crumb mixtures that I had remaining. When I make this again, I will try 2 eggs and the equivalent amount of milk, and 1 cup bread crumbs...

Yummy!  I needed to add more oil than called for and I left garlic in pan.  A little time consuming, but they were moist and flavorful.

Great recipe.  Makes for very tender but crispy chops.  I too "double-dip" in the egg followed by bread crumbs.

I was not impressed with this recipe...not enough flavor, the chops were tough & the recipe was wasteful. Much less breading ingredients could have been used.

These are SO EASY and SOOO INCREDIBLE!!!!  What a simple, flavorful breading!!  I did add 1/2 cup less of the bread crumbs, to enhance the flavor of the parmesan.  YUM!  Will definitely be making again!

These were great!  Moist and tasty.  I wouldn't measure the breadcrumbs and cheese and i'd only use one egg.  I had way too much breading left over to throw away.  I used panko italian breadcrumbs.  I'll make this again.

Added a little garlic powder and black pepper to the crumb mixture.  Used only half the crumbs and cheese, and it was plenty.  I double dipped, and the breading stayed on great.

These were really good.  The only change I made was I added a little garlic powder to the breadcrumbs.  I didn't need nearly as much egg wash or breadcrumb mixture as it called for so I'll be cutting back on both of these next time.

If I could give this 10 stars, I so would.  I made this for dinner last night for my fiancé, and it was simply amazing.  :-)  He absolutely loved it!  I used 3 thick cut pork chops.  I cut the bread crumbs to 1 cup and I put in a little of a cup of cheese in it.  I also added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper.  I pan fried them for 5 min. on each side, and then I breaded them again.  I didn't have an oven safe skillet, so I just transferred them to a glass dish and finished them in the oven.  After they were done, I covered the dish w/ foil because I was also making the roasted new potatoes (from this site) and they weren't done yet.  After the potatoes were done (about a half an hour) I dished everything up.  It was amazing!!!  I will be making this again.

I had fairly thick cut,boneless chops and was looking for a recipe that wouldn't dry them out.  This is a great recipe!  I followed the advise of others (reducing bc and dredging in flour 1st) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My husband who always complains about dry chops, said it was really, really good :-)

These are very good and pretty easy to make.  I would definitely suggest using only 2 tbsp of milk and one egg though.  Also, you probably could use 2/3 cups of bread crumbs, 1 1/2 cups is way more than needed.  I used 1 cup and I still had a ton leftover.  Great recipe!

The result is a 4 or 5 but I must mark the recipe down to 3 because of the extreme waste of bread crumbs and cheese. Crumbs and cheese should be halved to about 2/3 cup of crumbs. More than half of the crumb mixture was wasted.

They were pretty good.  They were a little dry but that was probably bc I forgot about them and left them in the oven a little longer than called for.  Still good though.

This was really, really good! I did not get all of the garlic out of the pan before adding the chops and, boy did that make a mess!  Next time I will use garlic infused olive oil instead of burning the garlic.

I changed a few things to make it better. 2 eggs instead of 3, 2 T milk instead of 3, 1 c Italian breadcrumbs, 1/3 c Parmesan, and I use garlic powder instead of cloves. The original recipe just made too much breading and chopped garlic just doesn't stick well.

Very good!  Easy recipe and pork chops were tender, tasty and moist.  Only negative comment is I wasted a lot of the egg mixture and bread crumb mixture - way too much was made for 4 chops.  I'll reduce next time.

Very good recipe. I'm not much of a cook and I had no problem with this recipe. I had 2 uncooked chicken breasts and 2 pork chops in the fridge, so I used both.The pork was really good, but the chicken was even better!

Excellent recipe, easy to make.  I used only 1 large egg and less coating mix (I kept the proportions the same.  I also used only 1 T of olive oil.  Husband and kids both loved it - would make again.

My husband and I kept talking about these all evening! The recipe for 4 easily covered 7 thin bonless chops, and I only used 2 eggs and still had plenty left over. This is definitely a keeper!  Mmm-mmm-good!

I rated this 4 stars last week because I did it with chicken breasts.  Tried it tonight with pork chops, if you don't try this, you're missing out!  No need to tweak unless it's for spices to your own taste.  Excellent.

These turned out excellent, and surprisingly tender and juicy! I added Italian seasoning to the breadcrumb mixture instead of parsley as well as some garlic powder.  I didn't remove the garlic from the pan before adding the chops, which I think improved the flavor.  I transfered the chops to a baking pan sprayed with pam before putting them in the oven.  Next time I will definately cut down on the ingredients, but other than that this is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe Elisa.

Yum, yum, yum!  I am so thrilled to have finally found a recipe that yields moist, tender pork chops!  I used boneless chops that were about 3/4" thick.  I reduced the ingredients for the breading in half (and still had lots leftover).  I also doctored up plain breadcrumbs (w/ onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, & dried basil) as I didn't have italian breadcrumbs.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written & the chops were great!  Thanks ElisaW for a great recipe!

Not bad. It needs more flavor though, so next time I'll add more spices.

Excellent recipe.  I've had trouble with some pork chop recipes being dry or tough, but these were moist and delicious. My picky teenage son gave a big thumbs up, too.

This was a pretty good and easy recipe.  Next time I plan on smashing up the garlic a little, as opposed to chopping, for easy removal before browning the chops.  I found it annoying to having to quickly remove the garlic pieces before they burned, thus distorting the flavor of the oil.  Browned chops for 1 minute on each side and baked them on a rack to produce a less greasy, more crispy coating.  Cooked them to 145 degrees (160 degrees would kill them). This worked out well.  Next time I plan on using thin chops because I used really thick chops and I feel the flavors and textures would have been steller.  Will definitely make it again!!!

This was so so for me. I wasn't that impressed with it. i also had to cook my pork chops longer then the alotted time in the recipe since they were thick chops. It seemed a bit bland for my liking.

Only four stars because I added oregano and rosemary to the mix and when the chops were done I squeezed fresh lemon juice over them. YUM!! I should have read all the reviews first because I have enough egg and dry mix left for about 8 more chops!!! But that's just fine because they turned out beautifully and I will make them again.

I will make this again but the reason for 3 stars is that the ingredient amounts are way off as others have also said.  I cooked 4 very large chops and 1 egg was sufficient and 1/2 of the amount of the dry ingredients were plenty.  My chops ended up being a bit soggy since I initially used the 2 tbls. of oil recommended - I had to add more while the chops were already in the pan (hence the sogginess).  The breading was tasty though and the infusion of the garlic in the oil added to the flavor.

Made these the other night and they were really good!  Don't usually make pork chops (except with Shake N'Bake)because they always come out too dry but these stayed moist. I decrease the eggs to 2 and the bread crumbs by about half and I still had some leftover.  I even double-dipped and breaded them.  I added some rosemary, Emeril seasoning and extra parm cheese to the breading and it was yummy.  My 4 yr. old, who doesn't like pork, even ate them!  Will definitely make them again!

This was really good! The breading tasted alot like the one we use on parmesan chicken.  Way too much breading was left over so I will cut it in half next time.  I made 9 pork cutlets and even double dipped them and still had about half the breading left over.

My oven was occupied so I had to fry these on the stove top.  I highly recommend it.  A seasoned crust on the outside, moist and tender on the inside.  As always, if you fry--watch your heat.

These came out good.  I sauteed the garlic and left it in the pan when I browned the chops(love garlic). I used the bread crumbs that already have parmesan cheese in it and added italian seasoning instead of dried parsley.  Nice and moist.   Four stars only because it wasn't something that blows your hair back.

Great recipie, my husband and I both loved it.  But next time I'll reduce the amount of bread crumb mixture.  It always ends up being a bit too much for 4 chops.

We LOVE these pork chops. I make them all the time.  It's a different easy way to use pork chops.  I've made them for company and everyone loves them!

I needed a recipe I could prepare quickly one night, so I gave this a shot. Turns out this is now one of my husband's favorites! I've made it several times. If I have fresh herbs on hand I add those to the breadcrumb mixture. Also, I cut back on the egg/milk mix - makes way too much. And once I also skipped roasting then discarding the garlic and didn't notice that it tasted any different. Wonderful, quick and easy recipe. Thanks for submitting!

Very good recipe for the pork chops.  I followed the recipe precisely the first time.  The second time I cooked the sauce(wine, milk, soup) seperatly.  I then used the sauce to dip the pork in.  Turned out much better, more crisp.

These turned out pretty bad for me, but it was my fault for overcooking because I used thin cut pork chops and cooked at the time for regular chops.  The breading was good, don't double dip!!  I always double dip in the egg, breading, egg and breading again on chicken, but it doesn't work as well on pork. Then you get a thick crusty thing that comes off in slabs.  I did this partially because I had SO much bread crumbs left over and wanted to use more up.  You could probably cut the amount of bread crumbs into 2/3 or  maybe even 1/2 of the what the recipe calls for and there's less waste, depending on how big your chops are.  ALso, I only used two eggs and two tablespoons of milk and it was plenty. (I had five smallish chops).  And when the recipe says remove garlic, this is a good idea, as I left it in because I love garlic, and it got a little crispy.   So all in all, this is a good recipe if you don't overcook and make the same mistakes I did.

Good recipe! But, it does not work as well without a ovenproof skillet. Also, don't try to bake the chops without browning them first or they will be soggy.

Loved this recipe!!!  I used all of the egg and bread crumbs and "double dipped".  Have the pan hot and ready and only turn the chops once to keep the breading on. I also drizzled the sauted garlic on top of the chops before serving.  Yum!

We aren't big pork chop fans - mostly because it comes out too dry.  BUT... this recipe was tender and full of flavor.  I used some roasted garlic (out of a jar) and it was great.

Absolutely delicious!!! Could cut down on the milk/egg mixture and bread crumb mixture. Had lots left over. The pork chops came out very tender and juicy. My bf loved them. I served with a side of home-made mac and cheese and cooked carrots.

Very good.  Followed the directions but had a lot of bread crumb mixture leftover and I made six pork chops.  I would recommend cutting down the bread crumb mixture.

These pork chops were a hit at my house.  I get tired of bbq pork chops all the time and these tasted wonderfully.  My husband kept telling me how good they were and even my 5 year old daughter liked them and ate her portion.  Very good recipe that I will keep handy.

Yummy! I scaled the recipe down to serve 2 and followed the other reviewers advice about the breading. I cut it in half and it still was too much! I ended up throwing out over half of it. I also cooked the pork chops in the frying pan at a low temperature in butter as I find oil burns food faster. Next time I will try it in the oven as the recipe states (I am sure it would be less greasy).
Very tasty! Thanks for sharing!

I thought these were excellent.  I agree with others that the recipe calls for entirely way too many bread crumbs, and I actually had a lot of egg wash leftover as well.  I took the advice of TURTLEEMU and used the flour method, although I used seasoned salt rather than regular.  The finished product was good, but pouring italian style tomato sauce over it made it great.  Will make again - thanks for the recipe, Elisa!

We absolutely loved this!!!!  It was simple and the pork chops stayed very moist.  I cooked my on the stove top and placed the lid on for the last 25 minutes.  I would recommend cutting both the egg mixture and the bread crumb mixture in half as I had lots of leftovers.

I followed the recipe the way Turtleemu said. I still think it needs something, maybe some Italian
seasoning. I only used 2 eggs for 6 chops.  I'll try again with some additions.

Not sure if anyone else was confused about what to do with the reserve garlic after cooking? I decided to add it to the bread crumb mix. It turned out to be a great choice.

So easy and so delicious.  You can easily cut the dredging down to 1 egg and 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/4 cup parmesan.  For 4 chops the recipe is way too much.

It was great but what was the point of the garlic, just to flavor the oil??

Followed recipe as well as the suggestions from others-tender and easy to make but not much flavor. Resembled a recipe I made in my single days. No real plans to make it again

Excellent recipe. The pork chops were on sale so I bought 2 packs, the other I froze for later. The bread crumb mixture I improvised by using some Italian bread crumbs and crushing up some almond nut thin crackers. It turned out that I didn’t need the entire amount, so I’ll save the mix for the next batch. Also, I cold have got by using 2 eggs instead of 3. The family thought this was a great tasting meal and I look forward to the next batch. I think making a 2nd time; it will go quicker. Delishous!

I had to add a little salt. Not enough flavor as is. I think the quality of the pork chop  makes a big difference here. Mine came out much more tender that I anticipated!

I loved these pork chops, definitely going to keep this recipe as a regular go-to! I didn't see the point of getting rid of the garlic in the skillet, so I left it in there and it added some nice flavor while browning the chops! I also just transferred them to a cookie sheet in the oven instead of doing an oven-proof skillet and they still turned out great. Next time I might try to do a flour and seasoning dredge before tossing them in the egg and bread crumb mixtures to get the breading to stay on better. I also need to play around with how much egg and bread crumb mixture to make, I followed the recipe for four pork chops and even with double-coating we were left with so much extra!

Marinated the chops in milk; dipped in beaten egg and coated with seasoned bread crumbs.  Served with sauteed mushrooms and white wine dijon cream sauce.  DH wanted to make sure I knew what I had done to prepare it so I could do it again. . .soon!

Excellent recipe. Followed recipe exactly as written. Even the cooking time was spot on. Best thing about this recipe is the chops had a lovely crust but inside meat remained moist. Could reduce the amount of egg by one and reduce the bread crumb/parmesan. I used two very large thick pork chops and had plenty of crumb mixture left over.

Yummy fall comfort food.  Hubby declared these were the “best pork chops I’ve ever eaten”. Wow!  I used some prepared cornflake crumbs I had on hand and doctored with Italian herbs and garlic powder, along with the parm.  Cooking method is perfect.  I also used peanut oil for the fry so I got a very nice  crust on them.  Definite do over!  Only regret is it took me so long to try these.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with AR.

It's very good, but it doesn't take 25 minutes in the oven after being fried in a pan for 10 minutes.  I would check it it after 10 minutes in the oven.  Otherwise it gets cooked too much.

I had some left over croutons from a salad kit so I made the bread crumbs from those. I added some Italian seasoning we had, then followed the the rest of the recipe as directed. My husband LOVE it.

Use a mallet and beat the chops first
Dredge chops lightly in flour
Bake UNCOVERED and use a rack so they are not greasy on the bottom.  My mother made these for years.  They are excellent.

No changes except after browning in a skillet I baked the chops in a Pyrex dish. Two eggs would have been enough for four chops.

Very, very tasty! Used panko, since that's all I had. Used my cast iron skillet and followed another poster's suggestion about pouring the leftover egg into the pan. My dog appreciated that. Thanks for an excellent pork chop recipe!

I made the recipe almost exactly as written...just didn’t need 3 eggs. Two were plenty.  Maybe it was the pork chops or maybe it was me but they just weren’t good.  They smelled wonderful cooking and they looked beautiful.  I’ll just have to stick with pork tenderloin when I want pork.  Chops just are never tender enough or moist enough for me!

These were absolutely delicious! My husband said and this is a quote, "These are the most tender pork chops I have ever eaten." This recipe will be a staple in my home from now on.

Family loved them! Only needed 1 egg and 1 tbsp of milk. 2/3 c of bread crumbs. I would have thrown out a lot of extra if I had used all 3 eggs.

This Italian Porkchop dish was delicious! Not a one leftover either. Very moist and no knife needed to slice. Will definitely be making this again.

This is excellent.  We used Italian bread crumbs and left out the Grated cheese.  Since our pork chops were on the thin side we baked them for 20 minutes and they came out great.  Very juicy and succulent.  We made it with the Low Carb Yellow Squash casserole on this site (with some alterations).

Delicious! Only comment I have is the dry ingredients could be cut into about half. I made 6 center cut, boneless pork chops and I had a lot of excess dry ingredients. I had at least three cups remaining. Other than the excess waste there, it was amazing!

I made it with smaller pork loins and they were tender and delicious.  I will use garlic powder in the bread crumb mixture next time because I couldn't get the garlic out of the oil very easily.

We pounded the pork chops really thin. We like to cook them hot and fast. It worked out beautifully! The flavors were great. It was easy to put the ingredients together and bread the pork chops. Will absolutely make this again!

Made this in a cast iron skillet & it turned out delicious. My only change in the recipe was that I had to leave out the eggs b/c of an egg allergy. Still a great dish.

I covered porkchops in foil as recommended. No matter what I seem to do they tend to end up on the overcooked side even after pulling them out a little early!

I made this for my family and they said it was great.  The rule is that if they don't like something I cook or have a way to improve it, they have to tell me.  I don't feel insulted...after all they're the reason I cook!  The important thing is that I don't keep making the same mistakes!  So if they liked it - it was tasty!  I used ingredients as written but there were a few differences.  The pork chops I had were close to 2" thick.  Bone in.  Ridiculous - but they were the only chops available today.  I breaded them and started to brown them and then realized I hadn't added the parsley or cheese to the crumbs. (First time through I floured, dipped in egg and then Italian seasoned crumbs) I took them back out and dipped them in egg (mixed with milk) again then into a second coating of crumbs but with the cheese and parsley added this time. The crumbs were fine and since there wasn't a lot of oil in the pan that I browned them in they didn't soak up a lot of fat.  I browned them a few minutes longer than written and baked them about 10 minutes longer.  Checking the temp after taking them out they were perfect.  I'm told they were not dry.  Thank you ELISAW for the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this dish. I decided to get pork loin and smash them into thin strips and it tasted delicious. I also added Parmesan cheese on top after it was done in the oven. Paired it with couscous and green beans. Would definitely make this again.

This recipe was a slam dunk! Husband could not stop raving! It calls for 3 eggs, but I had a lot leftover. I would knock it down to 2 and up the oven temperature to about 350. Otherwise it takes more like 45 minutes after cooking it in the skillet.

My family absolutely loved it, even the very picky eaters. Easy to make, definitely becoming a recipe which will be passed down! I just added some extra garlic powder, parsely basil, chilli powder, oregeno onion powder into my normal breadcrumbs - as I didnt have italian seasoned (improvised and made my own)  Still turned out great!

before i found this recipe, i was not a fan of pork chops.  Now its one of my go to meals for my family.  easy ingredients, healthy and very satisfying.  I switched out parsley for Central Market's Organic Herb de provence spice blend which combines sweet french and italian herbs with lavender and use a 50/50 blend of panko and italian bread crumbs .  I serve with green beans or a spinach salad, and a dollop of applesauce.

I made this for dinner tonight!  Aaand ladies and gentlemen....they were awesome.  I kept the recipe the same.  Didn't make any changes (ok, I added just a tad more on the parmeasan cheese), but it all came it great.  Served with Normandy veggies and brown rice and a good white wine.  Thank You Elisaw!  :)

Very good. Made changes after reading reviews; used 2 eggs, floured pork chops before egg and breadcrumbs and I sliced the garlic. Will definitely make again.

I have a hard time cooking pork chops, but these  were quite juicy and delicious.  To make it more keto friendly, I used Cajun spiced ground pork rinds instead of breadcrumbs and used a cup of each of the ground pork rinds and fresh grated parmesan cheese.  I used Italian seasoning instead of parsley, minced garlic, and half and half instead of milk.  I also left the garlic in the olive oil and cooked the pork chops in the skillet.  My husband loved them! Next time I will bake them.

I only had 2 boneless pork chops. I used one egg and 1/2 cup bread crumbs. Way too much! I can't imagine using 3 eggs and all the dry ingredients for 4 pork chops. Other than that, they were delicious! Will be making them again.

These were excellent. Used boneless porkchops which worked out perfectly. Will try it again with bone-in pork chops to see how that goes. Used fresh parsley instead of dried. If I make it again I was thinking about topping the pork chops with some marinara sauce or something to mix things up.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and my wife and I both loved the flavors. Since I baked four chops we have another meal later this week to look forward to  A couple of comments:

1) the amount of egg mixture and bread crumbs were much more than needed for four chops--I'd cut down to one egg and no more than 1/3 of the breading. I saved the remaining  bread crumb mixture for future use.

2) I baked the chops in my Traeger smoker at the recommended temperature using cherry wood pellets. Having never made this before I don't know how much flavor was added by the smoke but as I said we both loved the flavors.

The recipe makes too much of the breadcrumb ingredients. You could probably halve that part. The taste wasn't much different than a bare chop, so I'd recommend adding some more spices to the chops.

It’s actually really good! The only issue is it seems like it just needs a little something else, like it’s missing a flavor. But other than that, it’s delicious!

Halved the recipe for two of us so used 1 egg. I made crumbs from left over garlic cheese bread to which I added Dash Italian seasoning.  Yes there was some extra Egg mix and crumb mix left over.  I added halved small potatoes to the pan, made sure they were coated with the oil, sprinkled them with some of the parmigiana and baked them all together in the pan. The chops were thick so raised the temp to 350 convection. Chops were a little overdone but still moist and flavourful.  Will definitely make again.

Make sure your pan of oil is very hot.  The breading peeled right off of these in the pan, and depending on thickness of your cut, you risk over cooking them.  Not sure if it was the garlic oil. My mother made these in bacon fat and they were perfect.

While these pork chops were moist inside and crispy on the outside, we did not care for the flavor.  The seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan coating seemed to overpower the pork, which was disappointing.  It could have been just about any kind of meat, because the flavor of the coating was so strong.  I will not be adding this recipe to my collection.

Followed the previous reviews about dredging the pork chops in flour before the egg. They were tender. Might try it again.

Super good! I added some garlic & onion powder to the breadcrumbs and mixed panko in with the Italian breadcrumbs. Small changes to suit our tastes that really put it over the top. I'll be making this again & again for sure!

I didn't have an oven safe skillet, so I started them on the stove top then transferred them to a pan with a baking rack and finished them in the oven as mentioned by another person that had made them. For the four pork chops there seemed to be a lot of bread crumbs left over so I may cut back on the amount of them next time. Recipe works great and the pork chops came out perfectly cooked. This will definitely be made again.

I followed the recipe to the letter. I found these very tasteless, bland. I'm sure whoever posted this recipe truly enjoys it. Unfortunately, I did not - nor will I ever be tempted to make it again.

Followed recipe and watched video but resulted in a BLAND and no taste, there’s no mention of any salt in the recipe.  Wasteful using 3 eggs and the 1 1/2 cups of Italian breadcrumbs for 4 chops, I had over 75% left over.   I grated my own Parmesan cheese for this dish and it was just bland??.  Great video and clear directions but bland results.

I seasoned my chops with salt, dipped in a flour/season mix, dipped in egg mix, dipped in the panko (italian) mix.  Seared in garlic olive oil then threw in the oven.

Very, very, very good!! I skipped the parmesan and Italian herbs, floured before the egg bath, and loaded the bread crumbs with herbes de Provence. Wonderful! Don't skimp on the garlic pre-step; those little crispy bits taste awesome sprinkled over mashed potatoes!

I used lactose free milk in place of milk and gluten free bread crumbs.Gluten free bread crumbs are rather tasteless so  i added some finely chopped rosemary, basil and parsley to the crumbs. Also added salt and pepper to the  crumbs. I did not add the cheese (dairy issues)Very good and will make again.

I used shredded parmesan instead, and had to bake at 350 degrees because of my oven. Still came out delish!

Very good. I didn't pay much attention to the breading recipe, I just used my own usual blend that I use for chicken parm. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added some garlic powder, minced onion, and grated parmesan cheese to the breading - No measuring, just winging it. The cooking method was great. The pork stayed very juicy. I used a cast iron pan. Also, definitely flour the meat before dipping it into the egg mixture.

I put a tiny spin on this, by draining the oil and smothering in gravy before baking. My father-in-law loves it that way. we also have sauteed brussels sprouts for a side with this dish.

My husband loves breaded pork.  When we first started dating it was the nicest dish he knew how to make, well it still the finest dish he knows how to make.  Of course his involves shake and bake.  
I've not been a fan of breaded pork because I could never get a good crunch, the breading always ended up mushy- no matter what I did.  
I really liked this recipe.  I was able to get the breading to have a nice crunch, so I finally have a breaded pork I like to eat and isn't mushy.  Also, my husband likes them, so that's good.  

I did make  a few changes.  1.  I don't buy milk often so I used 2 eggs and about a table spoon of Dijion mustard.  I also flowered the pork before putting them in the egg.  2.  I didn't use finely grated parm, but a larger grate.  3.  I used fresh parsely.  I didn't have dried in the house and it was cheaper to buy a bunch instead of buying a bottle of dried. 4.  And I seasoned bread crumbs myself.  I don't mind Italian bread crumbs, but I find they get stale quicker and I don't bread that many things.  5.  I seared the chops with the breading in a pan and then cooked them on a cookie sheet.

A solid "very good will make them again."  Based on other reviews I first seasoned the chops and breaded them with flour before the egg mix and seasoned bread crumbs with parm.  Crumbs stayed on beautifully.  Browned them in cast iron skillet then into the oven.  Flavorful and moist result.

Quick and easy to make. I took the advice of other reviewers and floured the chops first, then repeated the egg & crumb dipping. I used panko crumbs, and cooked it on a rack in the oven. I didn't have time to brown it first.  Set it for 40 min, the hubby cooked it for about 20 more as it was a pretty thick chop. He said it was really good!  Yay!

Abloustley wonderful! Only thing I done differently, I used garlic paste and left in olive oil to give more garlic flavor! Was huge hit for my picky eaters!

Didn’t change the recipe except that I only had three chops and adjusted seasonings a tad. I really enjoyed the crispness. 
How can a recipe fail with parmesan? This is definitely one for company. It’s easy to prepare, cooks while you’re having a glass of wine and fixing the easy sides.

I wasn't bowled over with the flavor of these and I even salted and peppered the pork chops before breading.  I also added in some garlic and Italian seasoning to the breading mixture as suggested by one cook.  I used boneless chops, about 3/4" thick and finished them in the oven for 25 minutes.  They were a tad tough but a steak knife got through very well.  If I cook these again, I may saute' for less than 5 minutes in the pan.  Not sure this will make a big difference.

Just made this for the first time tonight. Made it in a 12” cast iron skillet that has been seasoned well over the years. The family was quite happy and I will be making it again soon. I used fairly thick cuts of pork chops from Wegmans. Followed the recipe exactly  as it was written. Total perfection. Side of garlic mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts

I made this just last night as an amateur cook.  I forgot to put the oven on so had to cook them on the stove, but they turned out amazing!  Lots of flavor, rich, and absolutely wonderful.  Now my family says that I have to make them again haha

Made this for an Italian themed Friendsgiving and they were super delicious!!  I bought a huge pack of pork chops from Costco.  They were quite thick, so we had to use a mallet and make them a little thinner.  They had great flavor and I'd definitely make again!

Really good flavored recipe but with these directions mine came out dry. Will probably be 4 stars once I figure out best way to cook it. Next time: double coating will probably use all ingredients listed. Add salt and garlic powder (instead of fresh) but use fresh parsley

This turned out very good! I was missing a couple seasonings so I made it up. Frying it in the pan first makes it nice and crispy! Delish. My whole family - grandma included (pickiest eater) at it all!

I actually hated pork chops since growing up my mom would over cooked them that it took an army to chew them and the amount of ketchup used. After this recipe the nightmares are gone, and is a weekly favorite. Made these for friends and the expressions on their face when they took the first bite then followed with “How did you make this?!” question.    I add a cup of cheese instead of 1/2 cup since I add extra cheese on everything. The brining I feel it’s key for this dish. If this is your first follow the recipe to the T then change it if it’s for you.

Delicious. I should have used some thicker chops ( 3/4 - 1") as they cooked too quick. A little ?? would have made 5 stars!

Great every time and a family favourite.  There are 6 of us so it's not always easy to please everyone but this is always a sure thing.  We always have it with mashed potatoes and homemade apple sauce from this site as well.  Delicious.

I love this recipe which makes a crispier, tastier pork chop. The only changes I make are to add garlic/pepper seasoning and I chop fresh garlic which stays in the roasting pan. I’ve been making these for a while now and today I thought it was time to say Thank you!!!So delicious.

I selected a rating because I had to in order to submit the following:

I did not make this recipe yet because I am a bit confused:

1. The printed version of this recipe states to bake the pork chops in a 325 degree oven, BUT the video version tells  you to bake them in a 350 degree oven.  Which temperature is correct?

2. The  printed version states to bake them to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F, BUT the video version tells you to bake them to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F.   Which internal temperature is correct?

Please help me.  Thank you.

I love the flavor of these pork chops. The only thing I did not like is how the coating stuck to the pan a little while browning them. I used olive oil, but parts still came off. All in all, I liked the recipe and will try it again.

The taste was awesome.  The only thing I changed was I added flour  before the egg bath and bread crumbs.  The only downfall was the bottom layer that baked in the oven was a little soggy. The top turned out very crispy and was perfect.   I will try this recipe again but I will find a way to keep the bottom crispy too

This works. We really enjoyed this recipe, and adjusting for flavor to suit our tastes. I had forgotten all about pork, and this recipe gave me a reminder, and satisfied my husband. We do have to makes adjustments for types of fat and salt.  This recipe is quick, easy, and a break from chicken, fish, and turkey. Chops are moist and tender. There is so much variation in the thickness of pork chops, that is is very worthwhile to test doneness with a thermometer. We've made this recipe a couple of times, an will continue.

Took several of the ideas from other contributors and baked at 375 without pan frying.  Also coated chops with flour before the egg wash and added garlic powder to the dry mix. This is the only way I'm ever going to prepare chops. They're moist, tasty, and have an outstanding flavor. Served over egg noodles that had a basil/butter sauce. I lined a small cookie sheet with vegetable sprayed foil. Made for an easy clean up.

Had these last night and they are really good.  I made my own Italian breadcrumbs and served them with a side of pasta, and fresh garden salad and Italian bread.  This is a fast, and easy recipe for any night of the week.

This was really good; my Italian husband loved it.  I followed the recipe  except ---- I DID salt the meat before breading!  You MUST season meat or it will be bland no matter what you do to it.  I only had two chops so I used less breading mixture. You want to make sure that the chops are well-coated.  I would not try to make these with anything less than 1 inch thick chops.  A little thicker even.  Thinner chops won't hold up to all this cooking and will come out dry. Bone-in is better as they hold in the juices and are less likely to overcook.  Make sure your skillet is hot so they brown without cooking through.  Iron skillet is best.

I made this dish, loved the flavors in these pork chops.  However the only draw back I encounter is that the meat came out dry.  I covered them in foil so it wouldn't over cook but that's my only draw back on this recipe.  Otherwise it was great.

Recipe calls for too much cheese 
Far too much breading as well: I only used half as much as the recipe indicates and that was with double-dipping them too.
It's possible that the pork chops I used were too small, and I baked them for half as long and that worked well.

We brined the chops in 2 cups water, 2 Tbsp. Kosher salt and 1½ tsp. Sugar for about an hour. I also used Panko bread crumbs for a crispier coating.  They only needed 2 minutes per side in the skillet.   The chops were in the oven for only 20 minutes and were already between 165-170 degrees, and they were slightly over cooked, so I would reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes. I would also flip them half way through so the bottom crust doesn’t get soggy.

Like others, I adjusted the amount used to prepare the pork chops and used flour first... then egg wash... then bread crumb/parmesan mixture.  This is an excellent recipe and very easy!

Really I only followed the method rather than the recipe. It was laid out perfectly.

I did flour, egg, crumbs.

Then a quick Browning in a pan.

And to the oven to finish.

I would give this a 5 star if not for the cook time. I used 1" thick  boneless chops and cut the bake time to 10 min and they were still slightly overdone to my liking. I assume the bake time would be better suited for thick, bone-in pork chops. Additional note: I did it with bone-in chops and they were still overcooked after 15 minutes.

OK. This is the way my mother made chicken thighs (skin on or off) so why wouldn't it work with pork chops? Really good. I mixed in a little roasted garlic with the breadcrumb/cheese coating. Pork chops were very tender, but I ALWAYS brine pork first - that insures juicy chops.

Fabulous recipe, used the flour, salt and pepper method to bind everything together better before using eggs and breadcrumbs and definitely bake on a rack in the oven to keep them nice and crisp!

I made it almost exactly as posted with the only exception being that I fried the chops ahead, and then about 20min before serving put them in a 350' oven with a little cranberry juice in the pan to help keep them moist.  They were very tender and i will absolutely make again !

Made this for New Year's and everyone loved it.  I used thin, large chops and put flour on them before the egg wash step.  I cooked the breaded chops 2 minutes per side, then baked for 15 minutes until 140 degrees.  I couldn't believe how flavorful, tender and moist they were.  Even my 88 year old mom ate the whole chop!  This is my new, go-to pork chop from now on.

Made exactly as recipe specified. Only thing I would do differently next time - and there will be a next time - is to season the pork chops first.

Delicious!

I used the thick center cut pork chops & they came out juicy & tender. The only thing I changed was the browning time, I shortened that to 4 minutes. Anytime my daughters eat without talking much I know dinner came out well. I’ll definitely use this recipe again.

Super yummy!  Made the mistake of buying very thick pork chops, it was a struggle as my friend tried to pound them down to a thinner chop.  LOL.  These were super tasty, everyone loved them!

Made these the other night, and not only were they DELICIOUS, but very easy to prepare and make. They have a very Italian feel and flavor to them, so maybe serve them with a pasta dish. Also, the recommended cooking time once you transfer them to the oven is 25 minutes, but I'd go a few minutes less to keep them a little juicier. I took them out after about 22 minutes, and then let them rest for about 5-10 minutes more. Enjoy! These are SO good.

This was delicious! I did have to reduce the cooking time by 10 minutes because he chops I purchased were slightly thin, so definitely keep an eye on them once in the oven.

This turned out very good.  I actually tossed zucchini and potatoes with the left over crumbs (they were coated with oil oil) and baked them with the chops. It was a one pot meal because I didn't brown the chops first, just baked them all and it was very tasty.  My husband loved it and asked to have this again soon.
Made this again, yum

I have made many different versions of this recipe and this is by far the best. The only thing I did differently was,  I coated thebpork chops with corn starch before dipping them in the egg wash. It helps keep the breading on.  Oh and... did I miss when the garlic comes back into the picture?  The recipe says remove for later use and then doesn't mention it again.

I will make it again.  Couple tweaks.  Maybe use bone in instead of center cut.  Also I might marinate center cuts next time before I proceed with the recipe.  They were delicious thou.

Very tasty.  Particularly troublesome is that the recommendation of temperature to cook to in the recipe is 145F but the video suggests the more traditional 160F. Personally, with today's Pork, I'm ok with less than 'well done' as the finished degree of doneness. 

Important to clarify this.

Bellissimo!  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I added Italian seasoning (1 tbsp) to the mix.  Very fresh garlic cloves  really make a flavourful difference. The loin chops I had were huge but when they were cooked through (took about 40 minutes) they were perfect and super moist.  Easy and delicious recipe.

I rated this 4 stars because I would change a few things. I would flour, then egg, then bread crumb to keep it stickier. I also used more oil and had more than enough egg with only 2 eggs. Good, juicy and flavorful pork chops, just add pepper!

I made it the first time following the directions. It needed salt. Second time making it, I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews.  I used seasoned flour before the eggs (I used 2 eggs, and only 1 cup of flour for 4  chops). I also cut back on the bread crumbs and added a little salt. They turned out great...just next time I'll add a pinch more salt.

The breading was really good, I left then in the oven for a tad bit long, hence the four stars.

My family loved it!  I did dust the chops with flour first. Next time I'll used smashed or sliced garlic--the chopped garlic was impossible to pick out of the oil. Also, I used thin pork chops so only needed to cook for about 4 minutes each side-didn't have to put them in the oven (I checked internal temperature to ensure they were cooked through).

These tasted good, but the recipe definitely needs to be tweaked. The amount of egg, milk and all the breading ingredients was way too much for 4 chops. It was such a waste of ingredients. They came out tender and tasty though.

Easily the best pork chop recipe I've made so far. I substituted the italian seasoned breadcrumbs for plain ones and mixed in some cajun seasoning instead, and they came out great.

My whole family enjoyed these.  Very tasty!  I dry brined the pork chops the night prior to cooking.  There was a lot of leftover breadcrumbs and egg wash even though my pork chops were large.  I will use half the amount next time in order not to waste ingredients.

Followed instructions by bonyng. But baked my 1/2 inch pork chops at 350 for 20 minutes. These are literally the best pork chops I have ever had and made! So tender and not dry at all!

made to the recipe, except I had made my own Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  My skillet not being oven-proof, I used a foil pan in the oven for 25 minutes.
The pork chops came out perfectly done, and moist. 
I had egg left over, next time I will use only 2 eggs instead of three.
Hubby was happy.

Just needs salt. Otherwise, delicious!  Did the flour dredge first, then double dredged egg and bread crumbs.

I tried to cook exactly as directed; though my pork chops needed turning at around 3 minutes (instead of 5) but my "medium heat" on my burner may be hotter than others. The overall end result was quite tasty, however they were rather soggy at the end instead of crispy when they came out of the oven and I'm not quite sure why. My family still enjoyed them however and I probably will make them again!

I had pork chops from Costco that I bought while they where on sale. Unfortunately I have never had good luck with pork chops.  I tried this recipe and it is delicious .  I butterflied the pork chops as they are always so thick I wanted them cooked thru but to stay moist and taste good.   This was recipe really fit the bill.  Moist and full of flavor.

My husband loved these. Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I only used two eggs and about 3/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs. I skipped the skillet and just baked these. Because I most always have an issue with pork chops turning out dry, I decided to try cooking them at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. I baked them at 325 for an hour and they turned out perfect. Hubby said they were juicy and had great flavor. Will definitely add this to my regular rotation.

This was good. Recipe doesn't need 3 eggs or a cup and a half of bread crumbs. Next time I will cur egg down to two and bread crumbs down to 1 cup.

This recipe was pretty good.  I thought it wasted a ton of the bread crumb mixture that you rolled the pork chops in.  I threw away more than I used. Could definitely half those ingredients.  Overall I thought it was good but not outstanding.  Will probably keep looking for another recipe.

Made with the addition of some onion powder to the breading mix and seasoned the chops with salt and pepper before the egg/breading process.  Very tasty thanks for the great recipe

We didn't really like these.  The flavor didn't penetrate the pork chops.  They would probably be better if I brined the pork chops first, but I doubt I will make them again.

My chops were a bit thin, so I reduced the oven time by 5 minutes.  Also, I had a lot of egg and breadcrumb mix left over, so next time I would reduce each of those by 1/3.  Otherwise, easy to make, tastes great, easy clean-up...since I'm cooking just for me, leftovers for later this week...the recipe is an all around win!

I didn't make any changes.  Except  for using gluten free bread crumbs.  I overcooked the 1 inch chops.  Yet, they were still tender and tasty. I will reduce the time of baking next time. We will make this again. Hubby liked it!!!

We've made this 3 times now & had to make a few changes each time to get it where we'd keep it. I took others suggestions & add1/4 tsp of garlic powder to equal 2 cloves of garlic. Using the powder mixes in with the parsley, cheese & bread crumbs better. We also dip pork chops in a little flour 1st before the egg mixture. Finally we decided after baking & frying, that we'll just fry the chops. I tried browning the 5 min on each side & baking 25 min but they were tough. They might've been to thick. We also browned & baked for less than 25 min & sliced thick chops in half so not as thick. Very juicy, but the coating was mushy. I like the coating so that is why we'll fry instead of bake - just for the crunchy coating.

Well its interesting to see her family stole my recipe! BTW add onion powder and garlic powder and skip the garlic. It tastes much better ( it becomes 5 stars!), I too am Sicilian, and my family are the best cooks!  I'd like to know what other recipes they stole from my family!!!  You understand this is all in kidding; Italians and probably most Mediterranean familys are very proud of their excellent cuisine and jealously protect their recipes.

You can never go wrong when eating Italian cuisine

I did not care for these.  Pork chops tend to be dry anyway and the breading only makes it that much dryer.  The flavor also seemed a little one note.  I followed the recipe exactly, except added a little flour to the chops before dipping in the egg wash and I didn't have an oven safe pan, so I transferred to a glass dish.  When they came out of the oven the crust was soggy, so I put back in the fry pan for a couple of minutes.

I do not have a skillet  that can be transferred to the oven, so I  moved the pork chops to a stoneware cooking sheet. They turned out beautifully. The pork was nice and tender and juicy. I will definitely make this again.

I this is a good recipe. Four stars because the bread crumbs and eggs amounts were to much and I had to add a few seasonings because I felt the Italian bread crumbs alone weren't flavorful. I also thought Pan frying for 5' was a little to long and burned the breeding done. It was an easy recipe to assemble and make. I also double dipped and coated my chops because I had so much.  They were done perfectly. Both sides were crispy and the meat thermometer worked great. I will do this coating instead of shake and bake from now on. I could see doing this with chicken too. I didn't pound my chops first and wish I would have.

This is my all-time favorite pork chop recipe. My young son loves it, I love it, my parents added it to their favorites... It's easy, but so flavorful- and only one pan!!! I always put foil over it when I'm browning and baking- saves on mess & keeps them moist. I usually pair it with warm buttered bread or jasmine rice. I've also served it over fresh pasta wih pretty much every type of sauce you can try (creamy tomato sauce is a favorite match).

Excellent and easy! Like others, I coated the chops in flour seasoned with salt and pepper before dipping in the egg and milk mixture. I moved the chops to a shallow baking dish for the oven and they came out most and tender after 20 minutes.

I altered this recipe just a little bit. 
Mixed 2 eggs with milk and dipped 5 pork chops in it. Then i mixed flour, garlic powder, salt, italian seasoning, crushed some Italian croutons. Then dipped pork chops in flour.  
Heated my oil and put the pork chops in to fry. They were so delicious and the kids (6, 13, 15) loved them. Served with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Total cook time 30 minutes.

This was very good and quick to prepare. Putting the chops on a rack in the baking pan when they go in the oven keeps the breeding from becoming soggy on the bottom.

What a great recipe!  I've made cutlets plenty of times, but they are 100% fried.  I used 1inch think bone in chops - did the flour deal - and since they were thicker did the 375 suggestion till done.  They were as moist as can be!.  THANKS!

This recipe was easy to follow, not a lot of ingredients but every bite was delicious!! The chops were juicy and tender with a wonderful flavor.  I used our cast iron skillet to brown the meat and then placed in the oven to finish baking.  I do highly recommend this recipe and will be making these again!

These were tasty and easy to make.  The only thing I would imporove is that it would be better to flip the baked chops halfway through.  For me, one side remained nice and crispy on the outside, while the side that was facing down in the oven went a little soggy due to the juices running out.

I make my chops like this, only I put them in the oven on 250 with some onions on top and a little water in the bottom of the pan, cover with foil & cook for 2 hours on low.  they are really tender.  everyone loves them especially me.

I followed the recipe but baked the pork chops on a wire rack and dredged them in flour before the eggs.  They smelled delicious in the skillet and browned nicely but were a little bland.  My pork chops may have been too thick?  If I make this again, I will use thinner pork chops or pound them flat first.

Made as written but completed cooking on the stove. Nice taste. Also took another reviewer 's suggestion and used the leftover egg wash and breadcrumbs and cooked that as well. Great idea for no waste. Thank you for the recipe and for that suggestion.

I made these a number of times using the recipe exactly as written .  The breading was crisp and flavorful while the pork inside was juicy and fork-tender.  Leftovers reheat so well that now I always make extra.  This is a great recipe.

My husband loved it and so did my pocket book. I had so much egg and bread crumbs left over that I ended up breading the only other thing I had around--squash. Fried squash and pork chops, we ate it all.

This is easily the best way to cook pork chops. I did change a few things. I used crushed pretzels instead of bread crumbs and fresh grated Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan and  also I cooked them entirely on the stove over medium high heat. I used half olive oil and half sesame oil.

Good recipe but needs more detail to the steps. i.e. What setting for when cooking pork chops initially on skillet? What to do with garlic after "setting aside"? Other than that this is great for dinner.

I am rating the original recipe and not a modified version. I am giving this recipe 5*'s due to the ease in preparation as well as the delicious taste. My pork chops turned out tender and tasty. I liked the one-skillet idea (I used my cast iron skillet). I do recommend this recipe to anyone wanting an easy and tasty pork chop recipe.

Great recipe, just follow what the reviews say -- fewer eggs and bread crumbs, and bread with flour, then egg, then breadcrumb mixture. Times were perfect for inch-thick boneless chops. Moist inside and perfectly appetizing on the outside! I would make this for company, it comes together so simply. Highly recommend (and so does Art who said, "This is really, really good" :-)

Good stuff!  I made it as directed except for my usual practice of double coating in the egg/bread crumbs and then letting them sit for 10-15 minutes to set up the coating before the frying step. That seems to help a lot in preventing the coating from falling off.  And, as always, the bake time listed is just a guide. Use your thermometer. Don't cook pork to 165 degrees unless dried out and chewy is how you like your pork ! 135-140 is sufficient nowadays.

This was one of the best recipes I've ever made and my husband agrees!! (Score!!)  It's either this recipe or a turkey breast that I made for Thanksgiving once (which was likely only good because it was from a great fancy butcher shop.) High 5 to the family who added this!! I used less Parmesan because we only had about 1/8 cup left and I used fresh chopped parsley instead of dried because that is what I had. I just patted it really dry and chopped it early so it could dry out a bit.

Love it just as is- My family loves these….I've tried pork chops other ways - and no one is happy until I promise to make these the next time.  I made them pretty much as described (I don't really measure anything, but followed these using the eye ball method) and maybe fried a little longer before the oven - but if I had to follow to a tee, the recipe is spot on.

I tried just the oven baking method that I do with oven-fried chicken, and I think next time I'll pan-fry in the skillet first to get the nice brown, crusty outer layer before baking.  The flavor was good, so I need to give this a second chance.  I broke my own rule:  always follow the recipe first!

These were easy and delicious! The only reason why I don't give this recipe 5 stars is because you don't need half the breadcrumb/parmesan mix or even all the eggs. It was a bummer to have all that go to waste. It didn't go to waste because grabbed some baby spinach and chopped up fresh mushrooms, poured over the eggs and topped with the breadcrumb mix and baked. Wound up being super tasty but there was no need for that much to begin with.

It was a hit! The only thing I did differently was double bread the chops.  Yummy and crusty!

Made exactly as directed and it was awesome!  This will definitely be a regular on our table!  Recipe doesn't say how thick the pork chops should be.  I used 1" thick chops.  Any thinner and I think they'd come out overcooked and dry.

Very tasty and will make again but will cut breadcrumbs and cheese in half. Way too much.  Same for the egg mixture.  Lots left over.   Next time will use non stick skillet and transfer to cookie sheet with baking rack to cut back on grease .   Like the idea of fresh parsley if you have it.

These were really good.  I had thick chops that i butterflied and the only changes i made was to use freshly chopped parsley and brown them in a 1/4 cup of vegetable oil vs. olive oil.  I personally dont think you need to use fresh garlic and risk it burning and ruining your dish.   Flour, egg wash, bread crumbs all seasoned with garlic powder, seasoning salt and paprika.  Dipping in all 3 steps insures great taste and texture.  I fried on medium heat to prevent burning and keep oil clear. Lower heat insures better flavor.

I added spaghetti sauce on top and parm/Romano to top it off before putting it into the oven. I served it over spaghetti and paired it with some saute green beans! yummy!

I was a little unsure how to rate this recipe. The seasoning gave it a good flavor, and we'll probably make it again. However, it isn't perfect. For one thing, there's way too much coating and egg. I'd rather have too much than not enough, but following the recipe as written will result in a lot of waste. For 4 boneless chops that were 3/4" each (not sure what type or size was intended), we used 1 egg, 1 T milk, and less than half the breading called for in the full recipe. Also, after 20 minutes in the oven, they were a little overdone. They weren't bad, and the FDA would be happy, but they were a little drier than we prefer. In all fairness, though, I baked them on a rack over a baking sheet instead of directly in the pan, so that may have affected cook time. I'm not going to ding the recipe for a change I made, so I decided 4 stars is the way to go.

Made it for the second time in a long time. I had local pork chops from my CSA. Eggs local too. Everything turned out perfectly. Crust perfect, crispy. Then what did my partner do? Dump an absurd amount of Worcester shire sauce on it. Way to wreck the crust, dude.

One star for him. Five for the recipe. It's a little labor intensive,  but worth the effort. And the timing can work if you're doing some starch and steaming vegs the last minutes in the oven.

The amount of dry ingredients was  a lot more than was necessary.  I only used 3 pork chops and had a lot left that I had to throw away.  I also only used  2 eggs in the mixture and that was more than enough.

Needs a little more flavor.   Added a little basil and oregano to the parsely.    Also tried adding a little italian seasoning mix from the spice house and that worked well too.   There's also too much of the coating mix in the recipe.   I generally cut it down a bit.

Made these last night for dinner.  They were quite tasty!  The chops were cooked perfectly, nice and juicy.   My only complaint is that the dry and wet ingredients are way too much for 4 large chops.  I felt like it was a waste throwing the extra away.  Could have cut the dry and wet ingredients to 2 cups and 2 eggs etc and would've been less waste.  But I will be making this again as I always have these ingredients on hand!

Fantastic recipe.  I loved it, now I only cook my pork chops this way.  

I even tried the breading on haddock tonight, when I made fish and chips.  OMG, it was really good.  I even added a little garlic powder to the breading. The only thing you need to omit is putting it in the oven.  By the time the fish is browned, the fish is cooked right through.

I made this and it is the best by far. My husband loved them and now it is the only breaded pork chop recipe I will want to use. I added some garlic powder to the breading. I browned them on stove and didn't have a skillet the last time to bake them in but put them in a covered baking dish and they came out tender and juicy. I baked them for 40 minutes at 325 in the covered dish . Done .

For 4 smaller boneless pork chops, use much less breading. Use 1 egg, 1T milk, 1/2 c bread crumbs, 1/8 c. parmesan cheese. Added a couple shakes of garlic powder and italian seasoning to GF bread crumbs. (Left out frying garlic altogether.)  Baked on cookie rack over cookie sheet at 375 for 35-40 min.

Lovely flavour. Had to make my own italian breadcrumbs - took home made dried breadcrumbs and added 1 t garlic powder and 1 t italian herbs.  Really good. Cooked on the stove top till done. Gorgeous and moist. This is a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing ;)

I made this today. First time to ever bread anything for me and I followed the instructions and put it in the oven loosely covered with foil then cooked for 25 then pulled the foil off and turned off oven and let it sit in a cooling down oven for ten minutes.   Was amazing!! No knife needed. So tender and juicy. Wife went back for seconds and kept saying how awesome they were. Will cook them again

This is the second time I make it. Don't have dried parsley so I switched with garlic and onion powder and paprika. Can't wait to try it with sauteed potatoes!!

I also skipped the skillet part- 30 mins in the oven was perfect. I used italian panko bread crumbs and it was delish! Next time I will also lessen the amount of eggs to 1 or 2 and half the bread crumb mixture- i made six thin sliced pork chops and it was more than enough.  Thank you for the recipe!

I cooked these as the main dish for a dinner party my girlfriend throws for her friends. We boyfriends/husbands have to just sit around bs and talk about work or whatever. Not me, that 's boring, I like to operate in the kitchen. Helps my anxiety, I can drink all I want cause I'm in the kitchen, I get something to do, and nobody NOBODY fucks wit da chef.  I tweaked it for the Cajun pallet but they were awesome. I served them with a little parmeseano reggio (?) and a sauce I whipped up. I win. Knocked it out of the park.

I used thick boneless pork chops.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but I didn't have any parsley, so that was the only change.

After browning the chops in oil for 5 minutes per side, I put them on a baking sheet and cooked them for 40 minutes at 350 degrees.  The chops needed that much time, because they were such a thick cut.  They turned out tender and delicious... full of flavor!   Great recipe!

Incredibly delicious recipe! If I could give it higher than 5 stars I would for sure! We are not that fond of pork chops, but these were the best tasting chops both my hubby & I have ever tasted! It left us wanting seconds & he has asked me to make them again & again. Thank you for the great recipe :)

Read some of the reviews and made some changes. I overcooked them a little but they came out delicious!  Pounding the meat was a great idea. Also, using a rack in the oven to separate grease is genius. The flour before the egg wash did wonders. All great suggestions that I read.

I made this tasty dish last night and they were the best pork chops I ever made. The recipes is easy to follow and remember. I didn't have a skillet that could go in the oven so I just used a baking dish and they were favuloso!

Huge hit with the whole family. My husband who is very picky about pork chops gave these rave reviews and has even requested them  for dinner a second time. I dipped them in flour, then the egg/milk mixture, then the bread crumbs as many have suggested.

I made this recipe almost exactly by the recipe. I used 8 boneless chops and I forgot the garlic. My family absolutely loved it. I put a roasting pan with a rack in the oven while it was preheating. I then transferred the chops from the skillet to the roasting pan. It only took about 12-15 for the chops to get done. I would recommend this to anyone.

Easy and delicious.
I made it gluten-free by using corn flake crumbs. To make the corn flakes "Italian bread crumbs," I used a ratio of 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning  to 1 cup of crumbs.

This recipe is very close to how I usually make them.  I thought this was just as good, if not better.  Not a 5 star recipe to me, but this is highly enjoyable & a nice change of pace. Thanks for submitting.

Delicious! My teenage son and I loved this.  I coated the pork chops in flour first and then dipped them in the egg/breadcrumbs. I also did what another reviewer did:  After browning the chops I baked them on a wire rack which gave them a nice crunch. I used thin cut pork chops and pounded them a little first.

Made these pork chops exactly as it was written except I doubled everything for a household of 5 since I had 8 pork chops. I ended up with WAY to much egg batter and crumbs but as far as taste and cooking, the entire family enjoyed it including my 4,7 and 11 year olds! Thanks for this amazing dish! We made it with a side of Asparagus and mashed potatoes.

Tastes great.  However, I had a lot of the egg mixture and breading left over.  Next time, I will use 2 eggs and 2 tablespoons of milk.  Plus, I'll cut the breading mixture down by at least 1/3 as well.

I had to sub mozzarella because I didn't have parmesan, but it was still super tasty. I also had to leave out the eggs because my husband is allergic, but I substituted ground flax/water mixture and added to milk and everything stuck together perfectly.
Definitely going into the menu rotation at our house.

We didn't have an oven safe skillet or fresh garlic so we adapted slightly --- we used garlic salt and garlic powder in the olive oil, and then used the oil from the skillet to coat the Pyrex cake pan we moved the chops into to bake them. 

They still came out utterly fantastic. By far the best breaded pork chops I've ever had, and they were well loved by all. They're being added to the family favorites list.

Highly recommend this recipe. Prep and cooking both are fast but the taste does *not* suffer for that, at all.

This is a new family favorite. I didn't change anything other than I had 6 pork chops. Also I was using my only cast iron skillet for something else so after I browned the pork chops I lined a baking sheet with foil and used that for the oven. It took 35 mins in the oven but I had rather thick pork chops.  Husband loved them! Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

Looks good and tastes good. I dredged in seasoned flour before the egg mixture and then dipped in the breadcrumbs w/ some Panko. Seared them in my new Cast Iron pan and then put it in the oven. Internal temp was 180 degrees after only 20 minutes. Between the salt on the chops (bone in)and the salted flour and the inherent salt in breadcrumbs and Parmesan...too salty for me. Not sure if I'll try again.

Excellent; quick and easy.  I did not tweak it in any way.  It was good just the way it is written.

I always thought that everyone did them this way, until I married and my husband adored them.  This is THE way to make pork chops.

Made this recipe after seeing it on TV but, it is fun to experiment with other flavors like sage or summer savory or herbs you especially like -- remember if you don't like it once just try something else.

After dredging in seasoned flour, seasoned egg wash and patting in seasoned panko crumbs, I spray with with a little oil and place on a rack in the oven so that all sides will crisp. I use the convection setting and bake at 375 (which is adjusted for convection) or 400F in the regular oven until done, depending on thickness. I do not find it necessary to brown in the skillet because I believe that I might lose some of the crumbs. In the past, I have added grated Parmesan cheese to the panko crumbs, but I believe this prevents crispiness.

I make this all the time!  I use the thicker cut chops,  But the Searing is important..  I recommend not skipping, the garlic infused oil is what makes this "Sicilian" Pork Chops..  the flavor is incredible!

Great recipe. I did not use the milk and used Italian spices with the parsley, but other than that it tasted great.

It was really good! I had a butterfly chop that I did this with. It was a little tough because I don't have an oven-safe skillet and had to do it stove top, but all the flavors were there. I'm sure it would've been 5 stars had I had the proper equipment. Can't wait to make this for my boyfriend. Also, lemon-pepper spiced asparagus paired wonderfully with it.

These were amazing and I honestly think this breading would go great on chicken as well!! I cut the recipe in half and only made 2 pork chops, one for my husband and for myself and it left me wanting more!! I used garlic powder in the oil instead of browning the garlic just to throw it out. They went great with roasted potatoes and my husband was a happy man =)

Great recipe.  I haven't tried it with the garlic... instead I use salted butter instead of the garlic infused olive oil then follow the recipe exaxtly the same as mentioned.  I am going to have to try the garlic infused oil one of these times as well...

All I have to say is VERY YUMMY!  And so easy!!! I did flour the pork chops before dipping in egg and had to use a baking dish since I don't have an ovenproof skillet but otherwise I didn't change a thing and my husband and I loved it. Thanks!

I loved this recipe! I did add about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning to it though. The recipe never said what to do with the garlic after you sautéed it so I drained it like it said then added it into the dry mixture. My family loves it!

My ex hubby of 20 years was also Sicilian and he made these all the time for us.  I couldn't remember oven temp or timing so looked up this recipe for a guide. I always season chops first, then dip in egg wash, then bread crumbs. While in bread crumbs, I used a fork to mash the crumbs into the meat on all sides, then brown on all sides. I use one inch chops. Then place into oven.  The crumbs have always stayed on better that way. I learned that from my granny when making chicken fried steak. But she used the side of a small bread plate to get her "breading" on the piece of meat. This is our go-to recipe for chops.

Grate recipe for oven baking pork chops.   The mix of breading was good but  too much for just two chops.   Highly recommend adding the garlic later in the cooking process so it does not burn.

The pork chops tasted better once I found a recipe for mushroom gravy and added the cooked garlic to that; and then smothered the chops in works.  Then, it was pretty yummy.

Very good.  Nice for a different twist on pork chops and easy too. I think I will double dredge next time for the additional taste and also because I had a lot of wasted breadcrumb mixture.  It was good as it is though. We will definitely have again

Bought a whole pork loin and when I cut it up, only made four premium boneless chops.  Now, I'm sorry I didn't make the whole thing chops!

I placed the sauted chops into a pie plate in the oven and used the pan juices, chicken stock, butter and mushrooms to make a lovely pan sauce and finished the chops there.

Dang!

Amazing. Though I do add chili powder, cumin, and paprika to the dry ingredients. Love it and it is definitely a keeper for me

I have made these even before seeing this version here.  A few tweaks that make them spectacular:  once ready to serve, squeeze fresh lemon over the top and garnish with toasted pine nuts.  Serve also with button mushrooms coated in the egg/ parmesan/bread crumbs and then sautéed in a skillet.

Excellent recipe that I had to switch up for dairy and gluten intolerance. Almond milk instead of milk. No cheese, so they probably weren't as crunchy as the original. Ground rice crispies instead of flour. I also double dipped. Thanks

Theses chops were a hit with the entire family, even the kids, who usually roll their eyes when they hear it is pork chops for dinner.  I didn't have enough grated parm, so I used shredded and it turned out perfectly fine.  The ziploc method for breading the chops is perfect for this recipe.  Like some others, I moved the chops from the frying pan to a rack in the oven and baked for an additional 25 minutes or so, rotating 1/2 way thru.  A keeper!

I might try this recipe again BUT...Like in the video, I also used a stainless steel pan and the majority of the coating comes off and is left on the bottom of the pan when turning the chops ( you will also see this in the video) :( The written recipe says the oven temp is 325 but the video is 350. I cooked them at 325 as per the recipe but only for 15 min and they were well done and tough and no longer crispy but instead they were greasy. Like I said, I may try them again using all the other advice in the reviews but I am not a fan of the recipe as written

So goooooooood!!!!!  I just used italian style panko crumbs and didn't add parm cheese or any other seasoning.  I just dipped boneless pork chops in the egg/milk mixture and then coated with the panko crumbs.  I browned in olive oil and then put them on the broiler pan in the oven at 425.  They came out perfectly cooked after about 20 mins and the breading was nice and crispy....deeeee-licious!

I love this recipe. Like one of the other reviwers, my pork chops were not always the best.  I've made them twice now for the family and the outcome was the same...excellent and not dry!  Thanks, I'm sharing with my grand daughter.

I followed this recipe, and the meat came out extremely tough and dry. The breading tasted good,  however, and the positive reviews make me question whether the problem could have been in the meat... but WOW, was it overcooked!  I'd retry this recipe, but reduce the oven time from 25 minutes to 15-20.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I had a package of pork chops in the freezer and had been avoiding it because I was a little tired of the same old ways I made it, so I began to search for new recipes with contents I already had in my kitchen and this was GREAT. I did all the required steps and added a little kick of my own. I seasoned my already seasoned breadcrumbs with cayenne pepper, garlic and onion powder, black pepper, and a pinch of salt. I then paired it off with some Au Gratin potatoes and biscuits. It was absolutely delicious. And my picky boyfriend even loved it so its an all around win.

Very simple, tasty recipe.  Easy to throw together after a long day at work.  I used thinly sliced pork chops and was able to skip the oven step.  they were thin enough that they cooked quickly on the stovetop.  Nice basic recipe that can be tweaked with a few seasonings if you'd prefer.

So my 6 yr old thought pork chops were chicken and said he loved them! So I hunted for a breaded pork chop recipe and tried this, slightly modified. I followed this recipe with a few exceptions...I used Panko and hand shredded the parmesan ultra-fine. I also used the shake and bake method with cheese, panko, a few dashes of mortons seasoned salt and a few dashes of Lawreys salt (believe me, do it, it's awesome) no parsley. if the kid sees green he runs. I minced the garlic to ensure it got the juices into the oil. it is easy to remove. move all the garlic to the side, tilt the skillet to the other side, used a wooden spoon to scoop out the garlic. I used a regular skillet, then moved to a glass dish for the oven. I also put the glass dish in the oven while i had the chops in the skillet to get it up to temp. I also used the rest of the breading in the bag and dumped it on top of the chops. plus sprinkled another 1/4 cup of parmesan on top. I cooked 5 1-inch chops for about 35 minutes. 150 degree centers, moist and delicious. The boy thought it was a giant chicken nugget!

I made and fed this to my parents, and they liked it.  I used the suggestion by one of the reviewers to use flour, egg beaters, and also put 1 tsp of garlic powder.  I thought it turned out really good.

Great recipe.  Hubby and son love these.  I tend to use pork cutlets.  I only used one egg and scaled back the crumbs and still had some left over.  This time I used garlic powder instead of fresh ut fresh is better.  Cooks up quickly but is yummy!  Thanks.

An excellent way to have pork chops in the winter.  I had a 7.5 ounce bone-in chop about 5/8 inch thickness.  I first went thru a flour bath (flour, pepper, kosher salt and cayenne pepper).  I then followed the other directions pretty much to the letter.  My chop was browned after about 4 minutes per side using a cast iron skillet at a temperature of about 340F.  The chop was also done after 22 minutes at 325F in the oven.  Delicious!!!  I will definitely have many more times.  I also pan fried the left over coatings (flour, egg and crumb mixtures) like a previous reviewer mentioned and these were also very tasty.

These chops were very tasty! As written, I give the recipe 4 stars (the meat needs some salt). They were also a bit greasy, but my 1" chops were sooo juicy!!
I also tried it using others' suggestions that made it a 5 star recipe!
1) skip the frying & place in a lightly oiled baking dish
2) dredge the chop in flour/salt/pepper, then egg, then crumbs
I served this with marinara, rice, green beans, & rolls. Even my picky eaters scarfed it down & asked for more!
I suggest using a meat thermometer to make sure your chops aren't overcooked. 165 degrees is all they need!

They burned. Other than that, the flavor was good. My husband liked them, and he's not really a big pork chops fan.

The breading fell off the chops I think I need to flour the chops before dipping in egg so crumbs adhere better to the chops. The breading itself was fine.

This recipe was very tasty just the way it was.  Didn't change a thing and everyone liked it.  Only things I may change next time is - 2 eggs is probably enough, and I seemed to have a good bit of extra "mix" so I would cut that back.  Otherwise, nothing!

Loved this. I didn't utilize the oven at all, cooked them to completely in the pan as the directions said I could on medium-low. I also coated them in flour before dipping them in the egg/milk mixture, to help everything stick better. I seasoned the chops before coating them with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder. When they were done, I sprinkled mozzarella on top of them and put them on a bed of pasta and our favorite pasta sauce. A play on Chicken Parmesan, it was wonderful!

We all really like it and it was a simple meal for us.  I did dip in breading, then egg, then breading again and still ended up with way too much breading and egg mixture to throw away.  I would at least cut these ingredients in half unless you have a lot of pork chops.

This recipe was a hit with my family, I paired it with homemade macaroni cheese, and broccoli. I coated the pork chops with flour, then dipped them in the eggs, and then coated them with the bread crumbs and cheese mixture.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought they were just okay. Definitely makes too much bread crumb mixture than needed. I'll try a different recipe next time.

Yummy! The only change I made was to dredge in flour + salt and pepper before the egg as others have suggested. I will say that it made probably twice as much breading as you need--next time I will cut in half to avoid the waste.

Yummy. Did the flour/salt/pepper dip first. Only cooked in the oven for about 18 minutes and the chops were fine (used about 3/4-inch chops).

This was a great recipe for pork chops.  Not too hard to put together and pretty easy to cook.  Good for a week night.  My husband (who previously thought Shake and Bake was the best way to make pork chops) LOVED this recipe.

This was simple and my husband and son both liked it. I used rice crumbs and rice flour rather than wheat due to food intolerances and added Italian seasoning to make up for the plain crumbs. Thanks!

This was great. I didn't have parmesan so i had to use cheddar but it came out great. My boyfriend enjoyed every piece and so did I. I seasoned the pork chops with a bit of all purpose seasoning salt and some ground black pepper before dipping them into the egg and milk mix. They were really flavourful.

This was super! I've cooked pork chops in the oven coated with bread crumbs and coated with flour when frying in pan. Never have they come out this crispy and juicy. Thanks so much for sharing.

Not a fan of pork chops at all and I have only tried this recipe once so far AND it was cooked for lunch at work so I didn't even get the joy of having it hot, crisp and fresh right out of the oven...but it still topped any pork chop I have had that didn't come off the grill.  One day I'll try it right from the oven...  Never the less, this recipe is going to be one of my go-to's for my work lunches.

Excellent recipe.  I add slightly more cheese.  Further, I see no reason to put it in the oven.  I just pan fry a 3/4 thick chop for no more than five minutes on each side at moderate heat. Enjoy!

Delicious! I took the advice of a few readers and I tossed the chops in seasoned flour and I put them on a rack in the oven so oil could drain.

This is by far the best pork chop recipe my family and I have eaten. Having lived in Italy for 9 years, this was the closest we have come to being able to recreate the recipe we ate at Italian friends' and neighbors' houses. Thank you!!

This was awesome and crazy easy! I ran short on breadcrumbs so I threw in some panko and a little garlic powder. I didnt have a skillet that can go directly into the oven, so I left the baking dish in the preheated oven while I cooked the chops. Transferred the chops into the preheated dish, and BAM! Very good stuff!

Not sure what happened because I cooked them exactly as the recipe suggested but this was totally an embarrassment. The chops were tough as a boot and dry as a bone. So disappointed.

I am a beginner when it comes to cooking but this recipe is very easy and delicious. The second time around I added some salt, pepper, oregano and basil to the mix and it was a little better.  My family loves it ;)

Pork chops were very tough. I only fried them in the pan for 2 minutes on each side and they were only in the oven for 20 minutes and they were still very very over-done. Use thick chops or lower the cook time! Otherwise it was good.

We've made this twice and it's absolutely fantastic.  The entire kitchen smells like heaven within 10 minutes of starting this meal.  It's hard for my family to wait for it to be ready - it's THAT good!

Excellent! we've always had pork chops the same way. fried, baked (creole seasoned) or grilled! I didn't have italian bread crumbs so I added italian seasoning to mine and added garlic pepper and of course I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet. We were all suprised with how awesome they turned out to be!

Great recipe ! I added some red pepper flake, salt, and pepper to the breadcrumb mixture. I also dredged them in flour before dipping them in an egg  (3 is too many). I used shredded mozzarella cheese 5 minutes before taking them out of the oven over the top of the pork chops. I served it with spaghetti and red pasta sauce.

Me and my boyfriend loved these porkchops; however, next time I will be trying what a few others have suggested. Either dredging in flour first, or double dipping. I will also not be cooking them as long on each side, since you put the skillet in the oven. My chops were a little too browned on one side. Other than that, SO Great and SO Easy!

This is quite a good yet simple recipe. Mild yet nice flavor. If you are looking for a rich overly flavored pork chop you'll want to add to it however for a fail safe, easy, quick, and delightful dish it's perfect

Great flavor! Followed the recipe exactly, but double dipped half of the chops to compare.  We liked both equally well.  I had four 1/2" thick chops which I patted dry before dipping.  There was a lot of egg and breadcrumb mix left over, so will make less of both next time.

Essentially made as written - had boneless chops so dropped oven temp to 300. Tried adding some Montreal steak seasoning to my breadcrumbs, made it a bit too salty. The breading cracker was wonderful. thanks!

The flavor of these port chops is great, but it is quite labor and time intensive.  My skillet was only big enough to cook two at a time.

I have used this recipe many times. I use 1" thick porkloin chops and season the chops beforehand with a 50/50 mix of granulated garlic and granulated onion and then a light dusting of Johnny's seasoning salt and let them sit about an hour.  I have also double dipped them.  They always turn out wonderful.

My dad also made this recipe. my family loves it.  He went one step further.  If he had breading and egg left over he would combine them and fry up a large patty, which we would pick on until dinner was ready.  My Dad did not waste any thing.

Fantastic! Super easy and quick. I did not have Italian bread crumbs so I just added some italian seasoning to regular bread crumbs MI also only had boneless chops so I used that instead. Kitchen smelled amazing and it tasted wonderful!

Nice recipe though I use two eggs instead of three...I have thrown out leftover. And I use six chops.  I also only cook for 20 or dries out.

This recipe is easy to follow and the result is delicious. I serve this with some Chinese Duck Sauce on the side for some sweetness. I am not a huge pork chop lover, but I love this recipe and my husband loves it even more. The pork comes out moist and the breading is perfect.

I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I mixed a package of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix in my plain bread crumbs.  I browned the pork chops and transferred them to a pan to go into the oven.  I cooked mine about 10 minutes longer cause they weren't boneless.  My son eats every kind of meat with ketchup and I asked him to try a bite without it.  He put the ketchup away and ate it all asking for more.  This is definitely something we'll be having again!

This was delicious. I double breaded, added some Italian seasoning and garlic salt to the breading as suggested by some and used less bread crumbs so i wouldn't waste a ton but beside that I basically followed to the T and it was flawless. I had no problem with the breading not staying on either.

How do I keep the breading from falling off? very good, naked pork chops, but if you eat the breading that's fallen off with the pork it's excellent! I used the flour method, let them sit for a few minutes before frying, was very happy with the flavor! very moist, I used thick cut boneless chops. will keep trying!

I've made this recipe quite a few times now and it's officially become a staple in my house.  I've changed up the baking time and method just a little though.  After I brown the chops in the skillet I transfer them to a greased baking dish.  Then I put in about 3 tablespoons of water around the sides, cover with foil and bake at 350 for the stated 25 minutes.  This makes them super moist!  Awesome recipe!

These are so tasty, but I made a few heart healthy substitutes.  I crush Fiber One rather than bread crumbs and add freshly dried herbs.  I coat with buttermilk rather than eggs (I've also used egg whites).  Other than that, I have tweaked this recipe very little.  It's fabulous right out of the oven, and remains so the next day after reheating. I think the Fiber One cereal helps retain the crunch factor.

These turned out really well, and smelled very good while cooking.  I did not have garlic cloves, so put about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder in with the bread crumb mixture.  We're calling them Mafia Chops. lol

I tried this the other night on my husband who is a VERY picky eater. He loved it!! It was easy to make and I loved it that once I threw it in the oven, I had time to wash almost all the dishes from making dinner. It is a wonderful meal, I had sides of steamed veggies and a green salad. I think next time I will try it with a tiny bit of angel hair pasta and marinara sauce. Definately a week night fav!!!

I cook these chops in skillet after taking out the browned cloves. They are really tasty thanks to adding those cloves to the oil before cooking them. I too, use the ziplock bag to coat the chops with the breadcrumb mixture. It is a good idea to reduce the mixture and also the egg wash ingredient amount...way too much goes to waste if not.

Best pork chops I have ever eaten. I was intending on using bone-in pork chops but our food store had a horrible selection the night we were making these, so I used boneless and I am SO happy I did. Boneless works so much better for this recipe.  They were juicy and SO delicious. I pounded them out a little before breading, egging, and dipping again. I also wrapped a couple in bacon before breading.. HIGHLY recommended. Egg noodles, applesauce, the perfect meal. Cannot wait to make them again.. my boyfriend and I fell in love with these.

Followed the recipe exactly and found it flavorless and dry.  I expected, per tasting the breading before covering my chops, for it to be bursting with flavor--but that was sadly not the case. I suppose i'll keep searching.

Pretty good, although mine weren't nearly as pretty as the ones in the picture.  I think I followed the recipe exactly, but I can't even remember now.

Great recipe.  I used a little nature's seasoning on the chops and used a small amount of flour before dipping in the egg batter.  I also used the skillet method as the recipe suggested and they turned out tender and juicy.

My mother made these and I have in my home for many years. I also make gravy from the drippings and serve them with mashed potatoes. I've used this method with chicken breasts too and my family loves it!

Wonderful! I did change it a little. I am sensitive to milk so I just used beated egg and I double dipped them. Added 1 tsp garlic powder (I was out of fresh garlic) to Progresso Planko Italian Style crumbs. I fried them in olive oil then I put 2 tbls olive oil to sprayed cookie sheet and baked them--Wow--made huge pork chops, a tiny bit overcooked I think 20 minutes enough--BUT very gooood!

These are pretty good pork chops.  I didn't follow all the amounts exactly--looked like too much, so I just mixed together what looked right and it was a perfect amount.  I may have had my heat on a bit high since it took nowhere near 5 min of browning on each side, but that is just a judgment and you need to watch your meat.  Nice and flavorful and a relatively simple weeknight main dish.  I served with pan fried squash for a complete meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great.  I took a reviewers advice to bake it on a roasting rack.  I pounded my chops b/c they were a little thick.  It was so good.  I just wanted to keep eating and eating.  Will make again.

Husband LOVED these...  Used thick boneless pork chops and kept amounts of breading and egg mixture the same.  Used 8 pork chops and still had breading and egg mixture to spare.  Could have used one less egg and probably 1/2 as much breading.  I'm going to try the extra breading on chicken.  I bet it will be good!!!

This was a great recipe - I did add just a little - My family LOVES the breading I make when I cook . . . I dip in egg wash, then whole wheat flour with salt and pepper, back into egg wash ansd then into the bread crumbs and other seasonings. I used my toaster/convection oven rather than the oven after searing the pork chops in Olive Oil. (searing took less than 2 minutes per side)  And then into the convection oven on 325 degrees for just about 15 minutes or so. Family loved it - even the kiddo who does not like breaded pork chops ;-) Thanks for a great dish!

So moist.  My family loved them.  I even just stuck them in the oven right after breading and they still came out great.

These are fabulous! I didn't have fresh garlic so used a tablespoon of garlic powder with parsley in the dry ingredients instead. My 11 yr old daughter gobbled up two chops in no time and she can be a picky eater.

Followed recipe as stated. I agree with other posts that you can cut way back on the bread crumb mixture. I would also coat a little flour on chops before the egg wash and sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on top of chops after coating with bread crumbs. Overall, it was a tasty recipe that I would use again with these changes.

These were really good.  I did make a slight modification since I was a little short on breadcrumbs, I added about 10 crushed Ritz crackers and about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  Like others I cut back on the amount of bread crumbs to 1 cup and only used 2 eggs.  I also sliced the garlic so it was easier to get out of the pan.  Overall very tasty breading for the chops.

I followed the recipe in all aspects except I used sour cream instead of milk with the egg wash. I also shredded pepper jack cheese instead of using parmesan cheese in the breading mixture. The only other thing I think I will try differently next time is use a broiler pan instead of my glass pan to make the meat crispier. All in all, the recipe is wonderful and everyone loved it.

Excellent, easy and fast! I didn't have any grated cheese so I added another 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and it was still a hit at dinner.

Wonderful... I also dipped the chops in the the flour misture and it worked pretty well. Made with sweet fries baked in the oven drizzled in olive oil. This one was a hit with the family! Yummy :)

My family absolutely loved these(even the ones who normally don't eat pork chops). The meat was very juicy and the breading gave it a great crispy outer coating. I will definitely make them again.

Delicious!  I used other reviewers tips and cut back on the egg. I also used plastic bag when I coated the chops and let them sit in the fridge for an hour a so before cooking.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. It will definitely be a staple in my house for years to come.

I really liked this dish. My only regret is not making some type of gravy. Served with "Breaded Brussels Sprouts" and baked beans. Also, I used the remaining breading and egg for the brussel sprouts.

Easy to make and tastes good too. This is just like a pork schnitzle I make, but I prefer the schnitzle because of the thinner cut of meat.

This meal was very good! It was very easy to make and we enjoyed it very much! One tip I would give to you guys is to cut back on the amount of breadcrumbs and eggs you use! With the amount they tell you to use I was left with way to much! I though it was a big waste of ingredients. So just saying that maybe you guys shouldnt use as much as they say! But overall the meal was very good, and had a lot of flavor to it!

I used the broiler pan since i didn't want to risk my cookware. Kept it crispy, not soggy. I also used one less egg as others suggested. Came out great. They real key it seems is to not let the internal temp of the meat get too high. I find this is the real reason why pork usually does not turn out well for me. Because my pieces were small (more like medallions), I only cooked them for 10 min. Even then, I could have cooked them less bc the internal temp was well above cooked. Turned out great, def. a keeper! Thanks a bunch!

Excellent and EASY and tasty recipe worthy of serving to guests. I agree with some others about the eggs and seasoned bread crumbs. I had a lot left over even after 4 thick chops. I suggest backing off of the amounts and gauging based on the number/size of chops you'll be cooking.

WAAAAAAYYYYYY too much egg & crumbs.  I had enough egg left over for a real nice breakfast and trying to figure out how to make hush puppies or something out of the left over crumbs.   Cut the egg by 1/2 and the crumbs by 2/3

These were pretty good! I made them exactly as the recipe directed. Next time I make them I'll cut down on the amount of breading - I ended up with way too much! All in all, very easy to make and very delicious!

These are really tasty. Some reviewers said they added extra olive oil and ended up with soggy breading. Just use the 2T as directed. I have also found it helps to bake them on a rack. Also, for four pork chops, you really only need one egg and you can cut back on the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.

I didn't like this as much as I thought I would.  I followed the recipe, but added two tablespoons of additional olive for the browning and dredged the chops in flour before the egg and bread crumbs.  The breading was soggy and  greasy and fell off of the chops.  The flavor was pretty good.  If I try this again, I won't add the extra olive oil and I'd add more seasoning.

These were very good and definitely a recipe i will use again.  I like frying them first then baking - i like the crisp outside and the browning of it.  like some of the viewers i too floured them lightly first ...  and used only 1 egg but definitely next time will cut back on the bread crumbs - i ended up w/so much extra that i had to throw away that was leftover..... other than that followed to a "T" and made with roasted red potatoes  YUM!

These are great. I had problems with the olive oil being too smokey so I used canola instead. Next time I will make less of the egg mixture and use less bread crumbs, as I had a lot left over. I also substituted 1/4 of the bread crumbs for regular flour to help everything stick. Instead of baking these in the iron skillet (I had 8 of them, so they wouldnt fit) I transferred the chops into a glass pan and they turned out fine.

So good! Very tasty. I mixed the minced garlic into the egg/milk mixture and that worked well (so you don't have to fish little pieces out of hot oil).

Very good! Husband is always asking for pork chops so I made this for our anniversary. As others suggested, I dredged it in flour, salt and pepper mixture before dipping in the egg wash. I didn't have garlic on hand so I put a liberal amount of garlic powder with the bread crumbs. Will make again, next time will use fresh garlic. Thanks for the recipe.

I marinated with garlic powder, then floured, egged and breaded, then egged and breaded again. The breading mix was delicious and these pork chops were a hit! I also used a ziplock bag like shake and bake,

I didn't use the garlic or the parsley, instead I just sprinkled a little garlic powder on the breaded chops as I browned them. They turned out great! I will definitely use this recipe again.

My husband is a very picky eater. He never eats anything unless it is plain. So I cooked this for me and made him a plain one. About half way through dinner he told me mine smelled good and he wanted to try it. Ever since this is the only way I can make pork chops.

I'm sure that pork chops would've been awesome if I didn't burn them.  I think the recipe called for way too small amount of olive oil.  I didn't even cook the chops 2 minutes before all the oil was gone and they were burning.  Besides that, they were really good and easy.  I will definitely make them again but next time I'll use more oil!  P.S.  This is my first time ever making porkchops!

If I could give this recipe six stars, I would.  I usually  never like how my pork chops come out, but these were tender, juicy and totally delicious.  The only changes I made were (like others said) I used one egg and less bread crumbs. Thanks for posting!

Oh so good and so easy!  Like others I dredged in flour first, then egg, then crumbs, then all three again.  Tender and really flavorful.

I too dread pork chops but this is a sure thing!  I made them and this is the first time ever that my pork chops were not dry.  This recipe made the most tender pork chops I ever tasted and is it easy too!  You will not be disappointed!

Crispy, tasty chops! A great alternative to our usual Shake-n-Bake. I followed modifications suggested by others and they turned out perfectly.

I really liked these pork chops. I did not use any oil or the garlic, I just ended up using some garlic powder and garlic garlic from Tastefully Simple. I did however drizzle a little italian dressing over the chops when they were almost done, cooked 5 more mins, and flipped and did the same thing. Gave it a great taste. I will be making these again.

Tasty, but not "the best!"  I followed another reviewer´s suggestion and transferred the chops to a broiler sheet before putting them in the oven.  The bottom crust didn´t remain crisp as I had hoped (and as the reviewer stated) but the chops were still good.

Although I really like the idea and the basic ingredients here - it did seem to need quite a lot of tweaking.  Our chops weren't even close to done after the recommended baking time and this recipe calls for about 3 times more breading than you actually need (big waste since it's contaminated by the raw meat.)  I suppose the end-taste was alright but plan on making substantial changes in order to have a economical (and fully cooked!) meal.  Thank you for the idea!

My new keeper.  The changes I made were keeping the garlic in the skillet, adding some other spices to the bread crumbs, 2 eggs, 2 tblsps of milk and 1 cup of breadcrumbs.  I still had a lot of egg and bread crumbs left.  The chunks of garlic went fantastic with the pork.

My Husband and I really enjoyed these, they were quite tasty. Also very easy to make. We are garlic lovers so I did leave the garlic in the pan to cook with the pork chops.

we had a couple of problems with this recipe - first, it called for way too much breading (bread crumbs, parmesan cheese), so I wasted those ingredients. second, I am not sure as to what I'm supposed to do with the two gloves of garlic I browned. and third, we just thought it was too bland. my husband requested we not make this recipe again.

Overall very good.  I don't think I got the true flavor as the recipie intended due to changes I had to make.  Couldn't find Italian bread crumbs so I used 1 cup herb seasoned & about 1/3 cup parmesan.  I used 1 tbsp of parsely & 1 tbsp Rosa Maria Blend Bread dipping seasoning--didnt have italian seasoning like others said they used.  I also coated the chops with flour b4 dipping in egg mix. I left the garlic in 4 tbsp of olive oil as well.  Next time I will use less oil.

These pork chops are awesome.  The only things I changed were to use panko bread crumbs and italian bread crumbs and I left the garlic in the oil for the entire time.  These will definitely be my go to pork chop recipe when I run out of shake and bake.

Pretty good, considering how easy it was to throw this together.  I dipped my chops in a mixture of flour, salt & pepper before dipping them in the egg mixture.

The porkchops were delicious but I had trouble getting the breading to stay on once I put them in the skillet. I coated them in flour first, then dipped them in the egg mixture, and then in the breadcrumbs. But pretty much all of the crust came off as it cooked in the oil. Probably just personal error but they tasted great so thats all that really mattered.

I really like the dish, though I find it can come out a little dry.

Pretty good. But nothing special. I added sage instead of parsley. And added dijon to the egg mix. I cooked for 25 mins. It was a bit too long. I would cook for 20 mins. To avoid being dry.

I never write a review but I had to on this.  I got an awesome from my husband on this recipe. I was nervous about the skillet in the oven, so I read previous reviews and found one that I think said to melt butter in a glass baking dish and place chops in there. The only thing different I did was only 1 egg and my Italian bread crumbs already had parsley so I left out adding more in. I had only 3 chops but only had 2 so  I threw in a chicken breast for the 3rd and it was great. Enjoy.

Absolutely delicious. I did the oven rack method as well, and for a little extra flavor, I marinated the chops in some Italian dressing, salt, and pepper for a while before breading them.

Excellent recipe. I did follow other reviewers advice to repeat the egg and crumb dips and I think it made the coating much thicker (which I personally like). I also seasoned the meat with salt and pepper. Tasty and the chops were very moist.

We loved these, I will say they do need a little salt, or some kind of seasoning. The breadcrumbs worked great but they still needed a little something. We will make again! I had no trouble with the breading.

I don't think you need that much bread crumbs though, I made 6 huge chops and still had a ton of crumbs left that I had to throw out, waste of money!

Wow. This one is definetly a keeper.  Like other reviews, I had too much egg mixture and breadcrumbs left over and I used 5 chops.  So will cut down on them next time.

The night I was going to make these pork chops for the first time, some unexpected guests arrived at my house for dinner. (I suspect they were led by their noses...) A couple of them didn't eat pork, so I whipped up a separate batch of breading, prepared some chicken breasts and popped both pans in the oven. (If you do this, bread and brown the chicken first, then brown the pork chops)
Instead of spending too much time in the kitchen, I layered some sliced raw potatoes and canned corn kernels on the bottom of the pan and put the meat on top. 
Adding the vegis (and a second pan of food) increased the cooking time to about an hour or so, but it was well worth the wait, especially for a meal I can just pop in the oven and not worry about. 
The chicken tasted just as awesome as the pork chops, and the guests said they would rather eat at my house than go out to a restaurant, so thanks for a great one! 
(I just received a rotisserie oven as a gift, and I can't wait to try these chops out in it...will keep you posted!)

These were really good. I did have to turn the oven up to 400 since I had very thick pork chops and I had somewhere to be. I will make these again for a change of pace.

These were so good!!!  We always seem to end up with a dried out piece of meat with not a lot of flavor.  These were very juicy and had great flavor!!! Thanks for a great recipe that we will be making again soon.

I did not have time to bake the chops.  I did not change any ingredient.  I did leave the garlic in the pan and then fried the chops. I will fry and then bake them next time.

These were great.  Simple to make and we all loved the taste.  I added some garlic powered to the breadcrumbs and that definitely added a great flavor.

Good pork chops. I think next time I would try it with pounded out pork chops more like cutlets.  The chops were a little thick for my taste.  This was not the fault of the recipe at all.  I use this same method for chicken all the time.

A very tasty alternative to your regular breaded pork chop. Adding the Italian herbs and Parmesan cheese makes them definitely tastier.

Delicious and super easy to make!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and coated the chops in flour before the egg and I only used 3/4 cup of bread crumbs and 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  Yummy!

These were pretty good, though I generally prefer baked or grilled pork chops over breaded.  I imagine we'll be making these again some day - it's a nice change of pace from the 'norm' around here.

This recipe was simple and delicious.  Even my picky 3 & 6 year olds enjoyed this one, and my super picky 38 year old asked me to make them again soon.  I did flour & double-bread as other reviewers have suggested.  The chops were thin-cut but still remained very moist and tender.

Just made these for New Year's for my husband and two kids.  They taste fine, but there's nothing special about them.  Took another rater's advice and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, but next time will use A LOT MORE garlic.  Will also use MUCH MORE CHEESE...I can't even taste the cheese in the breading.

This was okay, but with the oil it becomes relly greasy. I amde them twice and the second time I transfeered from the skillet to a baking dish and they were still really greasy. I didn't burn my hand on the skillet handle the second time though.

This really does make a tasty pork chop...however, I had really thick chops and I over baked them slightly so they were dry, but the coating saved them!  I always have trouble baking pork chops, but next time I will know better :)

My husband and I didn't really care for this recipe.  I think it was because of the olive oil, which seemed to overpower everything else.  If I make them again I'll use vegetable oil or butter flavored crisco when pan frying.

This was so delicious.  I didn't have italian seasoning, but I just used garlic salt and this Tuscan Seasoning from Penzey's.  It was so good.  For those counting points for WW, use the reduced fat parmesan and cooking spray in the pan.  Why is this so yummy?  Yay!

My husband enjoyed this although I wasn't a big fan.  Like others, I used only two eggs (which still seemed like too much) and less bread crumbs.  I dredged the chops in flour before putting them in the eggs.  After browning them in the skillet, I coated them again with the bread crumbs (thought I might as well since I still had so much left over) and then transferred them to a glass dish to cook in the oven.

We enjoyed this. I scaled the egg and breadcrumbs and also dredged the chops in a flour, seasoned salt, and pepper mixture before dipping. The flavor was good and the chops were very juicy and tender. Its still no "real" fried pork chop, but its still a good change from baked chops. We will have this again.

The picture drew me to this recipe. I read some reviews before making and decided to add more flavors. I seasoned the chops a few hours before and added seasonings to the bread crumbs and it was tasteless. We had to use lemon when eating it. I will make again, but will add more things, like salt.

Excellent! I also used only 1 egg and a couple Tbs of milk (for 3 chops) and did the flour/salt/pepper mix before the egg dip as recommended by others. My husband said he thought these were better than any he has had, including restaurants! I typically am not a pork fan, but also liked them a lot! Also, I left the garlic in, we're garlic fans and I think it added to the flavor. May try adding a bit of rosemary to the breadcrumb mix next time just for fun! But, as is, these were awesome and very simple to make! Thanks!

Excellent recipe! I, too, dipped in a flour/salt, pepper mixture, then the egg mixture, then the bread crumbs.  Then I seared them on the stove for a few minutes, then re-dipped them in the eggs and breadcrumbs again before doing another quick sear.  This made the breading really tasty and so full of flavor!  My husband really really liked these and we'll be using this one again from now on!

Outstanding Pork Chop recipe! I double dipped the chops and cooked completely on the stove. The chops were moist and very yummy.

YUMMY!  This was sooooo simple to make!  The pork chops came out juicy and the breaded crust was just perfect.  I did not change anything in the recipe as I'm still a novice cook.  But, with this recipe...nobody would have thought I was.  Will definitely make this soon!  Oh...I wasn't sure if my skillet was oven-proof (turns out it wasn't) but I doubled foiled it as someone mentioned below and it was ok.

My family is away so I fixed a couple of pork chops this way for myself tonight. They were tasty, but I didn't really care for them as much as some others I have had. They were not bad by any means though, they just didn't suit my taste. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty tasty. The pork chops were moist. I only needed to use 2 eggs. I also followed the other suggestions and dipped in flour before the egg mixture.

That was pretty tasty.   I really didn't change anything except I didn't use any garlic.  If I was going to, I would use garlic powder in the bread crumb/parm cheese mixture.  I will make this again.

I have to agree with other reviewers in that the breading is a bit excessive. I think half of the breading would be suffcient. I also took the advice of other reviewers and dredged in milk and egg which seemed to help the breading to stay on better. My husband and I thought these were okay, but the kids loved them, and that is always a huge plus! Will make again because the kids really enjoyed them. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I was so glad when I found this recipe as we've been getting tired of broiled chops.  This is a keeper for us.  Hubby and kids loved it. Although I did feel we had to cook it longer than what was stated.

This is a wonderful pork chop recipe....my family loved it! I fixed 7 chops, and used 2 eggs rather than 3. Next time I will use others suggestion of dipping chops in flour first. Great recipe...Thanks for sharing!

These are the best baked pork chops! They come out perfectly seasoned and moist and tender!  Other than throwing chops on the Barby, this is the only way I make them now!

Good recipe! My family really liked it.
I did dip in flour first, as others suggested, which helped the breadcrumbs stick better. Nice crisipy coating. Thanks! I will make again!

Stellar!...I made this dish with our homegrown pork chops for the family of 7 and it was a REAL hit! A quick note ...I did not put the chops in the oven to finish off..I just kept them in the skillet. Did not take away from the taste..Thanks for the recipe!

My fiancée makes this all the time now, and it is delicious! Pan frying the pork chops before baking them gets them plenty crispy on both sides.

This was, perhaps, the best pork chop dish I've ever had!  I made a couple changes, based on what other reviewers suggested.  I first covered my chops in whole wheat flour mixed with some Italian Seasoning.  Then dredged through the egg mixture.  However, I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I crushed up some seasoned croutons and dredged the chops through them.  I covered them in the egg and crouton/crumb mixtures a second time.  Followed the rest of the instructions from this point out.

I simplified this recipe by making the pork chops in my George Foreman grill.  For 2 pork chops I I used 1 egg and 1/2 cup  Italian  bread crumbs and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.  Spray the grill lightly with Pam and cook for about 8 min.  Tasted pretty good.

Unfortunately we weren't crazy about this recipe. I left the garlic in the pan and added even more spices than the recipe called for and still found it to be a bit bland.

This is a great recipe. Even down sized for two which is not always easy to do. I only used tow eggs as that was all I had. Even then it was more than enough,but,scambled egs for breakfast the next day took care of that. The exra bread crumb/parmesan mixture went into the frig and used to make Iealian Breaded (pounded thin) chicken breasts. (again on breast for two people)
Center cut pork chops about 1 inch thick are the best.
Hats off to ElisaW for a keeper in my house that can be used for any Italian Breaded whatever.

I can't make a good pork chop to save my life.  I followed the directions except I put the chops in a baking dish for the oven.  They weren't tender at all.  However, I used the same recipe for chicken breasts and they came out great.  Back to the drawing board trying to make a good pork chop.

greasy, not good
I made it after reading the reviews and was really disappointed. Mine came out very greasy and fatty. Probably should have trimmed them prior to cooking. Also it was like too many tastes at the same time; I'd rather eat grilled chops any day. My family wasn't impressed either...

I followed this recipe to the exact except I did place the chops on a roasting rack instead of in the pan.  My pan just wasn't big enough.  Served with pasta roni, corn, breadstix, and a mushroom gravy on top.  Excellent!

This recipe was great! I could not find the bread crumbs, so I used zesty italian croutons (crushed) instead.  Those worked wonderful.  The pork chops were very juicy and flavorful.  I will definitely make this one again!

Wow!!  This recipe was so easy and so great.  I cut the bread and egg mixture in half and added a half cup extra cheese.  I also left the garlic in the olive oil before adding in the chops.  Lastly, I eliminated the parsley and used fresh ground italian seasonings to lightly coat each side.  Goes great with Balsalmic Bruschetta, Insalata Caprese II, Sauteed Garlic Asparagus, Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe, and Chocolate Covered Strawberries.  All from this site. My boyfriend went on and on about them.  Thanks, will make again.

These were some of the best pork chops I have ever had!  I took the advice of other reviewers and halved the ingredients for the breading and still had some left over after breading four decent sized pork chops.  The breading stayed on the chops just fine while cooking for me.  It was nice and crispy out of the oven!!

A very simple and very tasty recipe for Pork Chops.  You can definitley cut down on the amount of bread crums, I also threw in some Rosemary from my garden.  I used very thick chops and cooked them for 35 minutes-still juicy. I served them with a nice corn casserole and the only thing left was the dirty dishes.  "A KEEPER" Thanks Elisa

I scaled this recipe to 6 servings and it was great. Too much breadcrumbs, though. I'd probably reduce that to 1 1/2 cups. Otherwise, very tasty and juicy.

Very tasty. I used crushed ritz crackers as I didn't have the bread crumbs, and I just added my own Italian Seasoning. Turned our nice and juicy and really yummy :)

These were a little bland.  If I make them again, I'll be sure to add some more herbs/spices to the breading.  Just okay for us.

Excellent recipe. This was the first time I have ever breaded pork chops and they came out so moist and juicy. The breading was so good perfect. I made them with garlic mashed potatoes and garlic parmesan green beans. Great dinner!!!

Moist and easy to prepare but a little blah to me. My husband really enjoyed this so that is why it gets four stars. Used pork tenderloin and pounded each piece.Didn't measure, just eyeballed. Used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. Served with asparagus risotto and a great Carneros Chardonnay.

These were wonderful.  I did cover them while baking because I was running late and after they were done, I uncovered them and let them bake a few minutes more.  I did about 12 chops and none were left.  They are awesome!

I am a novice cook and wanted to try something new.  The flavor of the chops was very good.  I think I should have browned them longer than five minutes on each side.  Mine turned out rather soggy.  I will keep trying though.  Thanks!!

My husband loves fried chops with gravy but we tried this recipe and my whole family is hooked. I was very pleased;the chops were not dry but very juicy and tender. I didnt use all 3 eggs but everything else stayed the same. Love it!!

I really like this recipe.  Instead of using garlic cloves, I sprinkled just a little bit of garlic powder into the breading.  I've also used this with chicken breasts and thighs -- delicious!

This was a great dish that I was able to put together quickly after work.  Hubby really enjoyed it too.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut down the breadcrumb mixture...even 1/2 was alot.)  Thanks; we have another "keeper"!

I made this recipe for dinner for a very very picky ten year old and she loved it. She was trying to pick all the breading off the bones. 
She isn't a big pork fan and she loved this recipe!
