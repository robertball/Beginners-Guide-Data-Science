This was very good! I used Johnsonville chicken chipolte fully cooked sausage. My kids like scrambled eggs and will never eat sunnyside-up eggs so I whisked the eggs before adding them ontop and pushed them into the topping ingredients with a fork making sure all the eggs seeped in. I used mozzarella instead of fontina and green onion instead of chives! I baked this in homemade semolina bread rounds. We all loved this and had it for dinner instead of breakfast!

I used a day old french bread loaf to make this recipe. No fontina cheese, I used mozzerella instead and half the amount called for. This was INHALED by my husband and kids in literally 15 minutes. My husband was actually offended that there wasn't more. To say this was a huge hit would be an understatement. This was very easy to make and quite cost effective. Next time, I'm going to try to make this with homemade turkey sausage (like ground turkey spiced to taste like breakfast sausage) and maybe fill it out a bit with more chopped vegetables.

I totally loved these pizzas ~ Thank you Johnsonville.  I did make a few changes.  I hollowed out like suggested and then coated with a think layer of tomato an basil sauce, I used small heirloom tomatoes in place of the roma.  I didn't add the egg, but even so these were delicious and a great recipe.

I must admit, I was dreading making these pizzas, because of my general apathy towards eggs.  However, I was tasked w/making Johnsonville recipes and was pleasantly surprised with this outcome; these are DELICIOUS!!!  I made as written, though I did add a bit of fresh mozzarella that needed using and used precooked ground sausage in place of links.  Our grocery store also stopped carrying fontina, so I used fresh grated asiago in it's place.  From a sausage AND egg hater, these are great!  I'm looking forward to making these for breakfast the next time we have overnight guests.  THANKS for the recipe!

My grocery store had only the ground sausage (weird), so I substituted that for the links. This was good: The flavors are perfect, and they are a convenient breakfast option. However, I think that I have a few tips that will help the next person to make the recipe. Unlike the first reviewer, I used a baguette as the recipe called for. This was a BAD move. The bread was so skinny that the egg yolks were cooked through before the whites were set, and some of the white spilled out onto my sheet pan. When I make them next (because I will!), I will use French bread and make battlements of tomato and sausage so that my white can really spread out. Maybe add some bacon, too.

Oh so yummy! I'd never thought of using Italian sausage in a breakfast dish. I did use Johnsonville Ground Mild Italian sausage instead of links and I didn't have any fontina cheese so used Colby instead. And the kids loved this too.
