These were GREAT and so easy! I didn't use a deep fryer but a large skillet and they turned out WONDERFUL! I'm definitely going to make them again!

Excellent I make these all the time. For a little twist dice an onion and fry it with the potatoes it is very tasty.

We enjoyed these because they weren't greasy like some we tried earlier. Thanks for sharing.

I LOVE THESE potatoes!!!!!! I have to say I make them a bit heathier now.  I mix a small amount of olive oil and the rest of the ingredients and bake in a 350 oven for 45 minutes.  You don't get the yummy fried crunch but they are a pretty close second.

I make these for breakfast with a dash of garlic salt and pepper and with a side of bacon. Wonderful recipe especially when I can't make it to waffle house for their hashbrowns:)! Next time I will try adding a few onions and maybe covering in cheese.

absolutely fantastic. my family LOVES potatoes so any way there is to cook season and present them is always worth at least a glance....this recipe is worth keeping extra oil on hand for those Friday night movies when chips just won't cut it! my oldest daughter (8) loves them with ranch dressing.

Funky twist to fries! I added a dash of all-season salt too for both color and taste. Go easy on the garlic salt (add to taste) b/c my first batch was a little too salty but otherwise good. Tried dipping in ranch dressing per a previous reviewer - which was good too. Thanks!

These potatoes were kind of basic but they were still really good. Next time I am going to add season salt to them as one user suggested. Thank you!

Excellent! I have made these a bunch of times and they are always a big hit with my husband. Thanks so much for sharing as I had no clue how to fry a potato by myself and I needed a good use for my cast iron skillet!

This is an interesting way to fry potatos I ended up getting my pan to full out of sheer laziness of not wanting to do 2 batches but they still taste like a good fried tater. I did add some onions to mine (IMO it cant be fried taters without onion) and added garlic salt that had parsley flakes in it already. I really enjoyed the garlic salt on them and my 6yo went wild for them.

Very easy and quite tasty though pretty basic. Excellent for a nice side dish with hamburgers steak or even breakfast. I will definitely prepare this again. It's easy to make especially since my slicing and dicing skills are improving. Be sure to use plenty of garlic salt and dried parsley.
