I've made these many, many times and even people who don't like pumpkin come back for seconds. I always use the Bettie Crocker pound cake  mix, and Eagle sweetened condensed milk ( not being a commercial, just seems like it works best ). The only thing I sometimes do differently is I add a little Vietnamese Cinnamon to the crust and the filling.

Made this with a from scratch cake mix recipe (Cake Mix from Scratch recipe from here) and I thought it made too much crust, which is perhaps why they suggest a jelly roll pan for this (I used a 9x13 pan and baked an extra 25 minutes).  However, that would still have made a lot of crust in relation to the topping.  Hubs didn't think it was too much crust and seemed to enjoy it.  He had a huge helping last night.  I did think that the combination was pretty good, if a tad sweet for me.  thanks for the recipe!

Made this in a 9x13 glass baking dish and added 10 minutes to the cooking time. Turned out perfectly with great reviews! Perfect pumpkin flavor without the (yuck!) pumpkin pie texture. I think this just became my go-to Thanksgiving pumpkin dessert recipe!

I used a yellow cake mix and added cinnamon. When I mixed the crust I was concerned that it was too dry and wouldn't stay together but the end result was fine.   I used the jelly roll pan that was recommended.

super easy and super delicious!   Baked it in a 9 x 13 glass dish for 35 minutes.  I didn't realize until the last minute that it called for nuts- all I had on hand was almonds so I chopped those up and mixed some ground flax seed into it and sprinkled on top- ABSOLUTELY love this!!  Thank you so much for sharing

These turned out great! You can slim them down to 120ish calories per serving by omitting the cake crust, using reduced fat cream cheese and omitting the walnuts. Honestly the slimmed down version still tasted like a nice treat and I didnâ€™t feel like I was missing out! Thanks so much for sharing!

Went like hot cakes at church potluck! The young men especially, were grabbing baggies to take extra treats home! I used a 14" x 13" pan with 2 extra teaspoons of butter. Will use again.

this is good, but I don't taste any cheesecake, definitely  needs more spices.

It's very good! My only complaint is it didn't look like the picture. Mine was very thin.  When I  make it again I will use a smaller pan. Also I must add, Put cool whip on top.
