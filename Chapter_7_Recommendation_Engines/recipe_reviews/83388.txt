This turned out pretty good, but I added a whole can of coconut milk (15 oz.) to make a nice sauce, doubled some of the other ingredients (honey, ginger), and mixed in a few different kinds of vegetables and put the shrimp in at the end so they didn't overcook.  I served it over rice.  It was delicious, and it made a lot!

Yum, thanks to the other reviewers, we really enjoyed this dish. I think the thing that made it great was the addition of lite coconut milk. If that was in the original recipe, I would up it to 5 stars. I also decreased the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. because of my kids and increased the honey to 4 tsp. I also added about 2 Tbsp. of low sodium soy sauce. I think this would be great with some nuts like toasted walnuts or cashews. I served this over angel hair pasta since we already had rice a lot this week, and it was delicious!

this is quite good but needs some tweaking ... I marinated the shrimp in the sauce ingredients before cooking it in the same sauce ... I've also tried it with a little orange juice added, to give it a little more flavour ... I serve it with steamed broccoli and a rice pilaf for a quick healthy meal.

Ok, here's how to take a good recipe and make it great (using recommendations from other reviewers and my own) - follow recipe as written except cut back on the red pepper flakes (way too hot to enjoy if not).  Before adding shrimp dredge in flour, saute with other ingredients a minute or two, then add 200 ml lite coconut milk, simmer until thickened and pour over warm pasta!!  Fantastic "Thai" like meal - even the kids loved it!

I thought this dish was AWESOME. I increased the amounts because I had more shrimp to cook. I also added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth at the end to make more of a sauce and served over rice. It was spicey so I would cut back red pepper flakes if you have those that don't like spicey. My husband loved it and he loves spicey food!

This was quick and easy and would have been fantastic but I hadn't expected the dish to be so lip-burning hot.  I'll definitely make this again but use much less red pepper. I served this over a bed of store-bought butter & garlic pasta and it was almost restaurant quality.

I left out the red pepper since I didn't have any & substituted paprika.  I would probably add a bit of red pepper next time since I had to doctor it with tobasco.  I used fresh ginger & added a whole tablespoon of honey.  I also added a splash of lime juice and orange zest when I cooked the shrimp.  To finish it off, I added 1/4 cup coconut milk & 1/4 cup chicken stock.  I served it over coconut rice & I can't wait to make this again.  Perhaps I will add some peppers and pineapple next time.  Yummy!

This is a delicious recipe.  I find that the ginger, garlic, honey combo tastes great on anything.  I used it to marinate pork tenderloin all the time.

This was okay.  I thought there was too little sauce, and what we did have was pretty bland, even with the addition of fresh ginger.  If I make it again, I'd try adding coconut milk as others have suggested.

Definitely needs less pepper flakes (unless you have an asbestos mouth!).  Would increase the ginger- it got lost in the heat from the pepper.  Worth playing around with, but wouldn't make it as written again.  4 stars, because my husband HAS got an asbestos mouth!

Good base but I added lots more to make it a meal. Carrots, celery, onion, broccli, fresh ginger, 3 garlic cloves, and mushrooms. Heat Olive oil & vegetable oil in pan and then add all veg except mushrooms. When other veggies are almost done add mushrooms, 2-3 tbl honey, chicken broth, ground ginger, a little terriyaki sauce, pinch of red pepper, shrimp and in my case left over fish. Top with sesame. While sauteeing veg get noodles ready.  I used 3 bags ramen noodles not broken  (do not use seasoning packets).  Boil in lightly salt water only,  then drain and add to veg mix. Be sure not to overcook ramen noodles. This serves about 3 hungry adults. Definitely making this again.

This recipe was simply great.  The red peper makes it hot which is right up my alley.  I love walnuts so added them with the shrimp.  Outstanding.

I agree with others, the 1 Tablespoon of red pepper flakes has to be a mistake...why would you have honey ginger shrimp where the honey is only 1 teaspoon and a ton of red pepper flakes?  I used about 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes and about 1 1/2 tablespoon of honey.  The flavor was good, but I think I may try some of the other reviewers suggestions and use some coconut milk.

Followed some other reviewers suggestions and added approximately 1/2 can of coconut milk. I also added extra garlic and honey along with adding some fresh ginger (still added ground ginger). This was delicious! Served over rice with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.

Have made this several times now, each time tweaking the ingredients a little more.  Less pepper, more honey and ginger.  This time added toasted walnuts for the last few minutes, very yummy!

Thanks for sharing this great recipe! (I gave it 4 stars, since I embellished a bit, and didn't "technically" follow the recipe to a "t!") I added extra veggies (julienne carrots, chopped colored bell peppers) and a 1/2 can of coconut milk, and reduced the amount per others reviewers' suggestions, both hubby and I loved it! Made as is, would likely still be a tasty and VERY easy dish, and as someone else mentioned, it can be embellished a million ways, with additional veggies, pineapple, mandarine oranges. . . I served this over cilantro lime rice (another great, simple recipe on this site)—YUM!!!

I used the recipe as is for two of us, but I did as angfoodie suggested and sprinkled the shrimp with flour and used a half can of coconut milk. I have never cooked with coconut milk before and was pleasantly surprised. I did add about a half of green bell pepper in bite-size pieces to stir-fry a bit before adding the coconut milk to add color and variety. I think next time, I will add a few canned pineapple tidbits at that time, too. We ate it over rice, and it made TWO servings -- not 4! I did not have raw shrimp, so I used the large frozen cocktail EZ-peel from Sam's that we usually keep in the freezer. My husband normally  does not like my "surprises" but he LOVED this one!

We loved this! Made a few alterations; added fresh chives, used red onion instead of yellow and added approx. 2 T. honey. Also added broccoli florets. I tossed the shrimp in a few shakes of soy sauce and garlic powder before cooking.  Was a perfect combo of spicy and sweet. I served it over brown rice; the rice tamed the spice just enough- but was still very flavorful. My hubby was crazy over it!

Very good, although very spicy with one tablespoon of red pepper flakes.  Made a second time with less and felt the meal was better.  Goes great with rice.

I am giving this two stars because 1 tablespoon of red pepper is way too much. I did not add nearly that much and it was too spicy. We normally love spicy food but this was too much even for us. Without that much spice and some added salt, it would be great. I made a soy sauce, honey and ginger sauce on the side.

This is fantastic with the coconut milk.  A little spicy but can be tamed depending on the ceyenne pepper used.

i have to say i make this recipe AT LEAST once a week. It is incredible. i do however leave out the garlic and add a bit of soy sauce (probably 3-4 teaspoons). even without the soy sauce it's still good but i feel it just made it that much better. thank you so, so much for such a good recipe!

I loved this and am giving it five stars, even though I made some changes.  First of all, the 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes must be a typo.  I put in 1 teaspoon and it was still hot enough to make my nose drip!  I also only used 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  For the sauce, I also added 2/3 cup Thai Lite Coconut Milk, used 3 teaspoons of honey rather than one, added a tablespoon of flour to the sauce to thicken it, threw in some steamed broccoli and carrots, and served it over jasmine rice.  I was also quite generous with the fresh Ginger and might have doubled it.  I actually think that this recipe as is should qualify as genius because the combination of flavors is perfect and you can add so many things to make it your own.  I'm so grateful that it was shared!  It also is very low in calories, and perfect for those who are dieting.  Very tasty... Very quick to make... It was a brilliant hit.  I will make this a lot.

This dish was very good, but very spicy. I took the advice of others and cut the red pepper flakes in half. Next time I will use a little less oil, I thought the dish was a little too greasy. Overall it is a keeper!

In reading the reviews, I opted to just make the recipe as shown, because there are many recipes online using coconut milk (Thai-like flavor). Yes, it was quite hot-next time I'll cut back to 1/2 of the red pepper flakes. I used 2/3 Olive Oil and 1/3 Coconut Oil (next time I will just use the coconut oil as it is more heat-stable than Olive Oil). Cooked some rice pasta and also some Vegetables with Broccoli, Carrot, Cauliflower. When ready to serve, I removed the shrimp from the pan, added my pasta and veggies and stirred into the remaining sauce.  Put the pasta blend on a plate, arranged the shrimp, and my husband couldn't stop raving as he was eating it.  DEFINITELY delicious recipe-it will become a favorite in our family!

It has potential.  I will try the coconut milk next time. I did not like the fact it was not saucy ... to compensate, I added the liquid of a small can of Mandarin Oranges w/ cornstarch, as well as the Mandarin Oranges.  I only used 1/8 tsp of red pepper ... firery enough for us.  We love shirimp, honey and ginger so it's hard to mess up.   I served it over white rice and the vegetable was broccoli.  Yum.

Good recipe! I doubled the honey (would actually triple next time for more flavor) and reduced the red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon--still rather spicy! I marinated the shrimp in the sauce overnight, and then dumped them into a sautee pan that I sprayed with PAM to cook them; added a dash of soy sauce while cooking for extra flavor. Served the finished product with steamed white rice and some cooked green beans that I sauteed in the saucepan for a few minutes after I had removed the shrimp. A good, quick dish with a refreshing taste of the Orient!

This is VERY delicious. I increased the honey to about a tablespoon + 1 tsp and I decreased the red pepper to 1/2 tsp as my son can't deal with heat at all. Even at 1/2 tsp it still gave a little bit of heat. We served it over angel hair with some bok choy and it was awesome!

I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of red pepper flakes.  I used about a teaspoon, and that was about the right amount of heat (for me).  It did seem like something was missing, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  It was okay, but next time I will certainly use it as a base and tweak the recipe.

I like spicy but I also like to be able to taste the rest of the ingredients, so I took note of other reviewers comments and reduced the red pepper flakes. I believe it was down to a heaping 1/2 tsp. more than plenty enough.  When I test tasted I was VERY disappointed.  Plenty hot enough but missing something.  Added an extra tsp of honey and that seemed to do the trick.  With these adjustments - it is most certainly a repeat recipe!  Thanks Mande - would never have come up with this on my own!  I forgot to mentioned that I used fresh ginger chopped fine. I try to use ground powdered ginger only for baking.  I think there is a big difference in the taste.

Could this recipe be any easier?  I decreased the olive oil and red pepper but doubled the honey.  I also added a little Garlic Teriakyi just so there would be more sauce for the rice.  I will make this again . . . SOON. My 7 year old LOVED IT

Absolutely delicious! I have been making this so much lately. I reduced the red pepper flakes to a tsp though, a tbsp is WAY too hot! And I left out the onion so it would be quicker. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a bit of coconut milk, if that had been in the recipe, I would have rated this a 5 (more like 500!!). Served on top of rice you just can't go wrong. I'm going to try it with the coconut lime rice on AR.

I cut it down to 1 tsp red pepper flakes because a full tablespoon seemed like a lot to me, and I'm glad I did.  Served with quinoa.   Will either marinate the shrimp next time, or add the coconut milk to make a sauce as others suggested.

This recipe needs some sauce and flavor, for sure!  1 T of red pepper flakes must be a misprint.  We used half a tsp. and it was plenty hot.  I also included a handful of fresh snow peas and when it was all cooked through, added about 1/4 cup of coconut milk.  Then splashed a little low sodium soy sauce to give it the savory taste as well.  Served over Jasmine rice.  Divine!  Will make it again, but only with the changes.

I too changed this a bit, but we enjoyed the end result.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and cut the amount of red pepper flakes in half, and also used 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil.  I also substituted green onion for the yellow onion, and added in a 1/4 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 since I didn't have any coconut milk.  I served this with garlic noodles.  The whole family enjoyed the dish and thought it had just the right amount of kick to it.  Thanks for the base recipe.

This probably would have been good-- but a tablespoon of red pepper flakes is WAY too much. Wish I had read more of the reviews since I see a lot of people decreased the amount of red pepper, but the boyfriend and I couldn't even finish it and had to go to plan B.

This is my second time making this.  I doubled the recipe and the shrimp made quite a bit of juice so I added some cooked spaghetti and left it on until the juices cooked off and it became sorta sticky.  It came out wonderful.

AWESOME!! SoOo spicyy though!! We like lots of onions and ginger/garlic for flavor so I added a whole small-med onion. Apart from that I added less than 1tbsp red pepper flakes. I love this as is and it's perfect on a bed of white rice! Next time just for variation I'd try it with soya sauce and coconut milk! Perfect in every way!!

I love this! My husband likes to make butter garlic shrimp and, I had see this once before but didn't rate it. I love his shrimp, but this added so much flavor and flair. I will say that add the very last seconds of cooking, he squeezed in a half of lemon and poured it all out to serve. It added a nice burst of flavor and light coolness. Also fresh honey from out neighbor, (who is a bee keeper) was not a bad choice either *wink*

This was really good but too spicy.  I like spicy food but not when it overpowers the taste. I doubled the honey but next time I will reduce the red peppers and add even more honey and ginger.  This is very quick and goes great with vermicelli. I think everyone's taste buds are different but most will enjoy this one. Thanks everyone, up to me, for the different ways to try it. I will be making this often!

Oh my God. It was to die for. We took other people's advice and shortened the amount of red pepper and doubled the honey. Wow. We also added some honey ham to the skillet and marinated it with the shrimp in the same sauce. We used frozen shrimp and although the sauce was a bit watery, it came out perfect. We placed this on steamed rice and beans. Try this dish! You will love it, guaranteed. Thank you for the recipe, and everyone demands we make it again. Easy too, and we're teenagers! Wow, that was amazing...

I agree with most reviewers, 1 Tbsp of red pepper is TOO much. As another suggested I also added more honey. The extra honey added to the other ingredients made a nice thick sauce. I had some left over fried rice from sesame chicken the night before. I put the shrimp on top of the rice that had some of the sauce from the sesame chicken and it was yummy. I considered looking for a recipe for a sesame chicken sauce when I made the shrimp the next time. I have used both raw and cooked shrimp, while both are good I think the raw shrimp was better. I have been looking for a great shrimp recipe and this is one of the best I have found. It is an added bonus that it is so easy and quick. Thanks!

Thanks to other suggestions I only used 1 tsp of the red pepper flakes  and 1/2 c. of chicken broth, it cooks down to a nice consistency. I also added an extra tsp of honey, served it on white rice
(used some of the left over broth in the water for the rice). This is an easy recipe and I will definitely make this a regular dinner item.

Woah! This dish is so yummy but VERY hot...not for the faint of heart. My boyfriend loved it, I thought my tongue went numb after the second bite...I suggest cutting the pepper down a bit and it will certainly still be every bit as spicy. Definitely a keeper! Also, fresh ginger compliments the flavor more.

For a quick meal this was great.I only used 1 tsp of the pepper flakes and it was still a bit spicy.We both like spicy foods so it wasn't a problem but I can't imagine how hot it would've been with the full Tbsp.Overall really good and easy though...

i thought it was really delicious, however it was way too spicy. i do think that a little less red pepper would be better, but if you like your food spicy, then this is definitely the one for you. other than that, just awesome and delicious

This recipe was very simple and delicious.  I would double the sauce ingredients next time because it tasted great, but just wasn't enough.  I substituted garlic powder for the fresh garlic and that was fine.  My whole family (even the picky one) loved it!!!

I give it 4 stars b/c it was a good start: I wanted to use up about 1.75lb shrimp, so I ended up tripling the spices (except for red pepper) and adding liquid to make it a little more bulky & saucy-some extra for the rice to soak up.  I had a bunch of leftover produce to use up, so I made the following additions/changes: 
1. Lots of fresh ginger in place of ground
2. Handful of fresh chopped parsley tossed in (leftover)
3. 1c. "V8 Hot & Spicy" plus cornstarch to make it really saucy.
4. 2T white wine (leftover)
5. Green onions in place of yellow onion (adds color & visual interest).
6. Baby carrots sliced lengthwise very thin (leftover)
7. 1 Roma tomato, diced (also a leftover).
Okay--so, I'm not sure if it's still the same recipe. But I loved the idea. I served it over jasmine rice and it was very pretty and yummy. Thank you for the great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. I used the coconut milk suggestion, and as the sauce was  a little thin I added a little cornstarch to thicken it. My husband loves this served with coconut rice. I was a bit sceptical and thought that the flavor combination would not be to my liking....I love it! can't wait to cook it again. Plan to include it in tbe menu for my family reunion!!!!

A great recipe! As promised, it's quick, easy, and delicious! However as others have repeatedly stated, it's MIGHTY spicy! Definitely follow their advice and reduce the amount of red pepper flakes! I used half a tablespoon and still felt it was too hot. Next time I'll only use a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I served this with Sweet and Spicy Green Beans (another recipe on this website) and white rice and enjoyed a tasty, but spicy, dinner.

After my own additions, I would crank it up to 5 stars! I used a large shallot instead of onion, fresh ginger instead of ground, served it over spaghetti squash and topped the whole thing with lime juice and chopped cilantro plus a little more EVOO...really, really good (AND healthy!)

This was a very tasty and quick dish. I actually made it 4 times, since I had some ground ginger to use up. I made it exactly as written, and served it over rice twice, and over penne twice. As nice as it is, it deserves a clearer name - the red pepper flakes are a very dominant flavor (though I like "hot" a lot), and the honey and ginger, though nice, are minor notes.

I thought this was good and would give it 3 1/2 stars, but my husband says 3.  We both think it is too spicy, and I only used 1 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I would try it again, but only use 1/2 tsp.  Every once in a while we both thought we'd get a less spicy biteful that was tasty, but I think overall the flavor was hidden by the spicy hot pepper flakes.

Wow!  The sauce for this was amazing!  This is so easy to make and uses common ingredients which is a big plus.  I did add a can of coconut milk, and increased the honey a lot...2TBsp.  It was quite a bit spicier than I prefer so next time I will reduce the red pepper to maybe 1/2 TBsp.  The flavor is really great even though it was too spicy for me.  I also used fresh ginger because I happened to have some on hand.

I rated this a 4 1/2.  It was tasty and easy to make...I will use less orange zest the next time I make this.  The orange overwhelmed the other flavors more than I cared for.  Other wise a very quick and tasty meal.  Will make again.

Very quick and easy.  I used only a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and it was still quite hot.  I recommend using much less if you don't like spicy food.

This sounded so great I decided to make it right away. I reduced the red pepper to about a teaspoon but  added a little cayenne pepper. I doubled the honey becuase I like sweet things  and used fresh ginger as I had it on hand. I also  used half butter, half olive oil because I think butter makes everything taste better.   I served it over coconut rice and it was delicious. I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome!  My 14-year-old made this (with my supervision) for us for dinner and it was a huge hit!  I cut back on the red pepper because my kids are not spicy food eaters, and we all really liked it!

This recipe turned out great.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly; I just eyeballed it.  I have made it three times and turns out great each time.

OMG it's hot!  I did cut back on the red pepper flakes by almost 1/2, but it was still quite spicy.  I have never heated the pepper flake in the oil before, so maybe that is were all the heat comes from.  We enjoyed it though, just not for those with tender mouths!

We loved this recipe!! However, it's important to understand that there are different brands and types of red pepper flakes out there. 1 tablespoon might be fine for very mild red pepper flakes, but my husband loves heat and 1/4 teaspoon is perfect with the type that we are using. You can imagine our surprise when we tasted this recipe the first time! Ouch! It really hurt! Just beware that tweeking might be necessary...

Absolutely wonderful! So simple and my kids liked it. I did use half the amount of red pepper and will probably use a bit less next time. I love spicy, but one child does not. Thank you for this great recipe!

My son thinks shrimp is just ok.  The whole family (including son) told me I could definitely make this recipe again.  The only change I made was increasing the ginger a bit as we are ginger lovers.  It was a quick dish to cook & serve with lots of flavor.  I added chicken broth to make a sauce per other reviewers so we could spoon sauce over shrimp dish with rice.  Really tasty.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is a great meal for a change of pace.

This was freaking fabulous!  Start with 1tsp crushed red pepper and add more if needed (I needed a little less and it had quite the kick).  I added butter and  chick broth to make more sauce and it was perfect.  I will def be making this again

I just tried this for the 1st time and from the very 1st bite my husband took he shout "10 right of the bat!!" 
I personally loved it too! I only used about 2tsp red pepper and I think it was perfect that way, I love spicy food but using a whole tbsp would've been too over powering.
Definitley making this again!

This was fantastic. I went easy on the red pepper since I have a low tolerance for spice. I also used fresh ginger and substituted green onions for yellow, since that's what I had on hand. Tons of flavor and pretty healthy too. An easy weeknight recipe I will definitely add to my rotation!

We didn't care for this at all.  Something about the combination of flavors just didn't seem to work.  Even the amount of red pepper flakes reduced to 1 tsp. was still too much.  A disappointment.

My family loved this. I added about 1 cup chicken broth and some corn starch to make a sauce and served it over angel hair pasta. Wonderful!  I did not put any chili flakes in so my 3 year old would eat it. Great recipe!

Wow, This was very tasty. I also decreased the hot pepper flakes. I used about 1 tsp, which was plenty hot enough for us. I increased the honey, too, about 1 T. in all. I served this with cocoanut rice. The flavours were amazing together. Thanks for posting.

Way too spicy! Made a couple test shrimp before adding the whole amount, and even my boyfriend, who loves spicy food, couldn't stand how hot it was. Had to reduce the red peppers by half, add extra honey and some water to make more sauce. Recipe as is doesn't make any sauce. With changes, was much better and still fairly hot.

The recipe was very easy and quick.  The shrimp had just the right amount of sweet and spice.  I halfed the red flakes. If you want more "sauce" I'd add a little more honey.  We served this with white rice and spinach.  Yummy.

Very easy and delicious flavor. I served it over angel hair but needed more sauce. Next time I'll return the pasta to the pan and toss to use up all the flavor & juices from the pan. I'll definately make this again!

Really really good! I didn't have red pepper flakes so I used paprika, and it was too spicy for me, next time I'll use less. But it was still very good and smelled SO GREAT while it was cooking, which took about 5 minutes. So easy! Served over brown rice with steamed veggies, mmmmmm.

I found this recipe to be surprisingly bland.  The pepper flakes made it "hot", but on the whole I thought it was rather tasteless.

Really tasty. I doubled everything but the red pepper and the shrimp, and also added even more honey and ginger to offset some of the heat from the red pepper. It was really good for my husband and I but too spicy for the rest of the family. I’ll definitely make this again but maybe with diced green pepper instead the red pepper.

My wife isn't big on really hot food so, I reduced the red pepper to one tsp. It was a little thin, but I think it was our fault. I think the shrimp may have had a little too much water on them. Next time, we'll pat the shrimp dry to see how it turns out. Over all though, this recipe had good flavor with just enough heat to satisfy my taste, but not so much that my wife wasn't happy too.

I used 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and that was too spicy. Added a bit more honey. Also threw in blanched snow peas and served over white rice.
Next time..using 1/8tsp of crushed red pepper! 
Still yummy.

I loved this spicy shrimp but the next time I make it, I'm going to use 1/2 tablespoon of red pepper flakes instead of a full one. I found it just a little to hot.

Definitely good, but as my first time making it following the recipe, it was really spicy. I made with some cheater noodles as I was in a pinch, but the pepper flakes overwhelmed the other flavors. Plan to try again cutting back some of the heat.

Made this gain, still good, but cutting back the red pepper flakes by half, still really hot. Recommend quartering the pepper.

DO NOT add 1 tbsp on red pepper flakes.  Consider 1/2 tbsp and this is coming from a guy who added sriracha sauce to his steamed rice.  My wife typically enjoys my cooking but not on this occasion.  Follow others comments as I will try the coconut milk tip next time I give this recipe an individual touch.

It had great flavor but was hidden underneath all the hottness. I halved the red pepper flakes and it was very spicy. I'm the person who puts Tapatio on everything so I like spice and it was still very spicy for me. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but with milk and a tissue

This recipe was an "almost" keeper.  We felt more honey would have helped it, and possibly a touch of sriracha.  We'll try this next time we make it.

I made this for a big crowd as an appetizer (on toothpicks) and they were devoured. I loved the honey and ginger! I doubled the recipe (except for the red pepper flakes)  since it was a big crowd and the only thing different that I did was  added about a tablespoon of butter to thicken the sauce.  It was a perfectly spiced and nice and light.  Everyone enjoyed them.  I look forward to making again and serving over pasta or with vegetables to serve as an entrée.    I would love to also try it with the coconut milk.

Wish I had read the reviews before I made it,  I usually do!  It was way too spicey!  My husband likes spicey food it was too hot for his liking that he had a hard time enjoying it.  Will try again with suggestions and a lot less red pepper!!

It was definitely good, but it was a little too spicy. I would absolutely make it again, but I would cut down on the red pepper flakes next time.

This was pretty good! I soaked the shrimp in about 1 Tbsp maple syrup. I left out the onions, only did half a tsp of red pepper, 4 tsp honey and used 1 tsp soy sauce. Everyone loved it! The only thing is I would add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit.

Perhaps not as intense a flavor as I had imagined, but a very enjoyable quick & easy lunch served with steamed broccoli.  Next time I'd like to use fresh ginger instead of powdered.  Maybe I shouldn't have added chicken broth and that would have helped the flavors caramelize on the shrimp better instead of being in the sauce.  Fresh basil made for an excellent taste addition.

I took off one star because I had to change the recipe. I used 2-3 Tbsp of honey and 1 1/2 tsp of the red chili flakes. I also added a dash of lime juice and some chopped coriander. Doubled the ginger to 2tsp.And this was delicious over coconut rice. My fiance didn't like the rice, and thought the shrimp was just okay. But i loved both.

Had a spicy yet sweet taste.. I made it spicier by adding more red pepper. Also, needed more honey than it called for.

This was amazing. Did not use the red peppers, instead, ground chili flakes. After removing the shrimp from the pan i quickly fried some cooked Capellini noodles. There are 2 things i would do differently and in different sittings. Next time i will fry mushrooms (portobello or oyster). The time after that, no mushrooms, but add orange zests.

Have made several times & we've decided not to put over any pasta for sure & next time try only 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. We like food with kick, but the peppers out do everything. Will make again because it is very easy & quick. May try serving over steamed veggies.

I'm glad I read the reviews about the red pepper! I added 1 tsp and it was perfect. Not too hot. I put it on top of rice as a side dish to baked salmon. yum. Next time I think I might add a can of crushed tomatoes and see how that tastes. Thanks for the recipe!

The only reason I give this 4 stars is because it was WAY too spicy! I would lessen the amount of red pepper flakes to 1 tsp or even 1/2 tsp if you have very young ones like me.

I first made this for my boyfriend in November.  He has since asked for "that shrimp dish that I like" multiple times.  I have added more honey and cut down on the pepper because it is way too spicy.  When I mix the pepper with the ginger in the pan, my eyes water and my boyfriend starts sneezing.  It's a strange thing, but the dish is really delicious.

Great recipe!!! One star is missing for an overload of pepper though. Like some other reviewers, I added more oil and honey to make more of a sauce, then tossed the mixture with Chinese noodles. I did add more of every seasoning except the pepper, and on that, be warned: if you're not into serious heat, DO NOT add the full tablespoon of pepper!!! I added a teaspoon and this was more than hot enough for me! Except for that one ingredient, the proportions I used were the same as this recipe, just in greater amounts. I also added a splash of mirin (sweet rice wine) that I had laying around. Overall, a great blend of flavors!

Great recipe.  I did add about a tablespoon of orange juice to the recipe as suggested by an earlier reviewer.  I didn't measure how much of the red pepper I added, but we happen to like our food spicy so we didn't mind the heat one bit.  I served this with saffron rice.

I made it three times and on each occasion,made ajustments to some of the ingredients. It was good all the time. My favourite though was when I added 2tbsps of the red pepper flakes. This recipe has since been on my rotation menu..it is one of my favourites.

Used precooked shrimp, just put them in at the last minute to warm them, but not make them tough.  Served over angel hair pasta.

This recipe did not work for us.  My husband didn't like it so I made him a poboy with the shrimp and he thought the poboy was delicious....probably because it was smothered in ranch dressing.  I used frozen shrimp so that may have been my problem.

I used a little coconut milk for more sauce and wilted some baby spinach leaves into it.  Maybe a few cashews next time.

I made this tonight and it was a hit.  I didn't follow the recipe to the T and I used 1 small onion, 2 cloves of garlic, a bit of crushed and ground ginger, more than a tsp of honey, chopped fresh parsley and used 1/2 the amount of red pepper flakes which was still a bit much and served over basmati rice.  I like the idea of using coconut milk (yumm) so will try that next time around.

My boyfriend & I thought this recipe was delicious!  We had a spring mix salad on the side with vinaigrette dressing.  I started placing my shrimp on the salad and wow!  My new favorite salad!  I make this every couple weeks.

My husband & I loved this! I used only about 1/2-1 teaspoon red pepper,I increased the honey to about 1 tablespoon, and I used fresh ginger. Definitely serve with either basmati or jasmine rice (made with some coconut milk)

I'm sorry I did not care for this at all.  It lacked flavor in my opinion, but perhaps I did something wrong.  Thanks for sharing it was worth a shot!

I really enjoyed the overall flavor of this.  I did cut down on the red pepper so I think it allowed the other flavors to show through.  I will try again.

I thought this was really good, but it was hot.  I used half the red pepper and it still had a pretty good kick to it.  I served it over jasmine rice.

This is an excellent recipe!  A lot of people complained about it being too spicy.  However, if you use common sense and reduce the amount of red pepper, it is a great meal!  Goes great with a little jasmine rice.

Extremely spicy!  I cut the red pepper in half and it was still too hot for my kids.  The idea is good...might try it with more honey and even less peppers!

I made the recipe as written because I like spicy food - but this was too spicy even for me.  All we could taste was heat.  I'll try it again reducing the pepper and increasing the honey, because I think the recipe is a really good idea - it just missed the mark.

Pretty good as is. I agree that the red pepper can be overpowering. I think I will add a bit more honey and fresh ginger next time. I would have liked a bit more sauce. Served with white rice and steamed broccoli.

Like others, too hot for us, the red pepper flakes overpower any other flavors.  Possibly a milder chili powder?

This was simple to make and delicious.  I omitted the red pepper for my kids and one of them loved the shrimp.  For us, I followed the recipe and thought it had just the right amount of kick.  Thanks for a great recipe.
