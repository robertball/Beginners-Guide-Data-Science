One of our favorite pies.  I use 2 cups of diced mango.  I also use 1/4 c. sugar and 12 splenda packets instead of the granulated splenda and 2 T. amber rum instead of the extract.  Delicious!

This was fantastic!  I made a crust out of sugar-free shortbread cookies because I could find neither a sugar-free graham cracker crust nor sugar-free graham crackers.  I also substituted plain homemade yogurt for the sour cream.  It turned out delicious; no one who ate this could tell it was sugar-free!  Next time I might try increasing the amount of lime juice and zest, as my (rather large) mangoes overpowered the lime flavor somewhat.  Also, I liked the flavor of the mint sprig garnish with the pie, so I might mix in some chopped mint leaves with the filling and increase the rum extract for more Mojito-like flavor.
