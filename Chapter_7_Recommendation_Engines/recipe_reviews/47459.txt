This very well could be the most delicious thing I ever tasted!!! Mine for some reason was ready in about 40 min, not 1 hour. I had no fresh coconut so I added 1/2 cup extra flaked coconut and used buttermilk bread instead of french.

I loved this recipe!!  My changes were...1 can coconut milk, 1 cup 2% milk, 1 stick melted butter.  I used all flaked coconut and one tablespoon vanilla with one tablespoon coconut extract.  I also, added a can of pineapple tidbits and made a Hard Sauce to go with it.  Fabulous!!

I layered bread cubes (try cinnamon or other flavored breads), dried fruits including raisins and diced apricots and flaked coconut in about 3 layers in a greased glass casserole. Mixed liquids (used coconut extract and no coconut milk) and almond, rum and vanilla extracts. I also cut back on sugar by 1/2. Oh yes, used buttermilk with the eggs rather than cream or milk. Poured liquids over top and let set 30 minutes... be sure to press cubes down into liquid every 10 minutes or so! Dotted with butter and baked... yum. Everyone who tasted it said it was incredibly good.

What a super flavorful twist on bread pudding!  Very very sweet though.  I tasted it before baking and added a cup of milk and another egg to tone down the sweetness and was still very sweet, but still very good. I think I will skip the sugar next time since there is plenty of sugar in the condensed milk.  I used leftover ends and pieces of 4 or 5 different loaves of bread, added cranberries, used shredded coconut, subbed vanilla extract and may add pineapples next time also.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Yum, yum, yum!  I didn't pay close attention to the ingredient list before diving into mixing.  When I realized I only had one can of coconut milk (not condensed milk as one reviewer said--no wonder hers came out too sweet!), so I substituted a cup or so of heavy cream for the second can of coconut milk.  I also didn't have coconut extract, so I used a tsp or so of vanilla extract.  I also didn't have nutmeg, so I used allspice.  My pet peeve on recipe review sites is when someone changes 12 things and then gives the recipe a bad rap.  I'm here to say that this one is delicious and hard to mess up even when you are ingredient-challenged!  I used my convection oven at 300 degrees, and it took about 35 minutes.

WOW! The best bread pudding I have ever had!  We had eaten 3/4 of the pan before it was cool.  Didn't have powered suger so I used splenda.  I also used 1 can coconut milk and the rest lowfat milk.  No fresh coconut used extra flake and tossed in a hand full of semi sweet chocolate chips.  Yum.

It was amazingly good, though I put in 2 shots of Bacardi 8-year dark rum because I like the rum taste.  

It was big enough of a hit that it was gone far before all the other dessert trays at our pot-luck.  5 stars for this one!

I am not sure what I did wrong here but this had very very very little taste.  I used flaked coconut b/c the fresh was too hard to cut and I was limited on time. I also didn't have coconut milk so I used whole milk.  Maybe that was the problem.  But, it just was so so and I ended up throwing most of it out because no one was eating it.

Delicious...even when you're not a bread pudding fan.  I used left-over pannetone (Italian Holiday Bread) and it was delicious. The changes I made were that I cut the coconut milk to 1 can, substituted half and half and added pinneaple tidbits (about 3/4 cup).

As Doug Heffernan would say, "It do not get better than this!" I was looking for a way to use up some leftover coconut milk I had in the fridge left over from a Pina Colada punch I made (I really should submit that recipe), and was really excited when I found this, since I love both bread pudding and coconut.  Since it's just the hubs and me, I cut the recipe in half and left out the extra egg yolk, since it would have been problematic to use half of one.  I also didn't have fresh coconut, but I DID have some Trader Joe's roasted coconut chips, so I used those in the same proportion as the fresh, and it turned out very well!  It was a little sweet, and I used unsweetened coconut milk, so I will probably cut down on the sugar next time.  I also think it's important to not leave out the step of greasing the pan with butter and confectioners' sugar and toasting the coconut on top during the last of the cooking was a very nice touch and shouldn't be omitted. I will be serving it to company tomorrow and can't wait for them to love it!

AWESOME!  Just made this last night and the WHOLE family thought it was great.  Thanks for sharing.  I was able to buy a whole coconut from my local grocery store.  My husband poked a few holes in the top, drained the "milk" inside, then just cracked it open.  After it's been open I just used a butter knife to pry out the white "meat", and then shredded it. This is a keeper!  : )

I used all flaked coconut because I did not have fresh.  Also, I used vanilla extract for the same reason.  It turned out great.  I shared this with my teacher friends and they all loved it.

Yum! I made this as written, except I used all flaked coconut because I couldn't get any fresh. I topped this with a little coconut syrup and whipped cream when I served it (just to be totally evil), but it is also perfect on it's own. Thanks for the recipe!

My boys (21 and 19) loved this recipe!  Gone in minutes.  I did add extra coconut though.  We had never had bread pudding before so it was a great introduction.

This was a delicious bread pudding Yoda.  Great coconut flavor. I did not have the flaked coconut (bummer) when I made this, so I added about 1/2 a cup of quick cooking oats.  I made this as a late night snack and had some left-overs for breakfast the next morning...which were yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

I did change things up because I was using what I had. I only had one can of coconut milk so I put in a cup of milk and almost a stick of butter like another reviewer did. I did not have fresh coconut so I used sweetened flaked coconut. I also added a handful of chocolate chips. Lastly, I used bread I had around the kitchen that was not being eaten by anyone- potato hot dog buns and two slices of white bread. Regardless of all the changes, it was delicious and I will make this again.

You have to REALLY love coconut to make this....  I used all flake coconut, and substituted vanilla extract.  The 2 TBSP was WAY too much- next time I'd cut it to 1 TBSP. Overall, great texture, great flavor if you like coconut.

We absolutely loved this recipe. The coconut tweak was delicious. Used french loaf bread but really didn't need the whole 1 lb., just enough to coat evenly and not make a mushy mess at the end. Did not have any fresh coconut on hand so just used shredded sweetened. I would definitely recommend using coconut extract (if you love coconut). For the coconut lover, its worth it! Pairs wonderfully when warmed with vanilla bean ice cream!

If you love coconut, you'll love this!  I made a few changes so I'll start with that.  I didn't have coconut extract or flavoring so I used 2 tsp. vanilla and  1 tsp. rum flavoring (sort of Pina Colada type idea here).  Didn't have fresh coconut but had a can of "young coconut in syrup" so I cut it into fine slivers and used 1/2 C. of that.  My hubby likes raisins in bread pudding but I didn't think they would go well in this so I used a cup of pineapple chunks and cut each chunk in 4 pieces (measured after cutting up chunks).  I had leftover Croissants and just some plain bread so I used that.  Next time I'll just use 5 eggs instead of wasting a white because I don't think it would have made a difference.  This is a very forgiving recipe so you can experiment with it.  This was awesome - Hubby was soooooo happy!  If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.  Yoda, you are brilliant!

The very best bread pudding! I did not use the fresh coconut and used vannila instead of coconut extract because that is what I had on hand.I am sure that apricots would be delicious addition to this recipe.

This is the best dessert I have ever made.  The flavor and the consistency are perfect.  Scraping the fresh coconut is a bit of a chore but it's worth it.  Try this one.

I recently had a piece of coconut bread pudding that was delicious! I was in charge of desert today, for New Years dinner. I wanted to recreate the bread pudding I had the other day. I followed this recipe except I replaced the loaf of French bread with Hawaiian Sweet bread. It was delicious, and I believe better than the other day. It could be, I didn't have to pay $4.25 for a single serving.

This was very good.  If you like coconut, you will like this.  One of my girls is a big coconut fan but it must taste like real coconut not just flavored.  Followed the recipe.

It was really good - I added about 3/4 cups of chocolate chips - delicious! Very easy - it was my first time making bread pudding and it was a success!

I switched up just a few things like instead of coconut essence, I put a bit of good vanilla essence.  I also added more fresh shredded coconut than sweetened shredded coconut, oh a not white sugar just brown and a touch of confectioner's sugar with the toasted coconut on top.  It was really delicious!  Sweet but not overly and there was great texture too.  I will make again.  I can see this also going really good with some vanilla ice cream. easy and a winner!

Other than using all packaged coconut instead of the packaged/fresh combo, I made this as directed and it was quite a hit for Easter brunch.

Good recipe..I used only 1/2 TBSP of the coconut extract, and added 1 TBSP of vanilla extract.  I also followed the other reader's advice and used only 1 can of coconut milk.  I added 1 cup of milk + 1/4 cup heavy cream.  Then mixed in 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 cup crushed pineapple.  Baking time was about 50 minutes.  It came out so moist and tasty.

This was my first time making a bread pudding, and it turned out great.  I took it to our chuch potluck, and brought the pan home empty!  I didn't have fresh coconut, so just used flaked.  I will definitely make this again!

Pretty great. I am going to play with it though, and do so using the shredded coconut. Since there are so many everyday ingredients, I just don't see myself using "fresh flaked coconut" unless for a special occassion. Maybe thats why I didn't give it 5 stars.

I have to say that my all-time favorite dessert is bread pudding.  Based on the three-star rating, this is not the best.  It's not bad, but it's not the best.  With that in mind, here are somethings you must know about this recipe:

1.  You must like coconut.
2.  You must REALLY like coconut.

All in all, it's not bad, but in the end, it tastes like a generic crumb donut.

I cut the sugar in half, used egg beaters instead of real eggs, omitted the yolk and the butter, and a splash of Malibu Rum instead of the extract.  Next time I'll substitute one of the cans of coconut milk for whole milk or half and half and probably add some crushed pineapple too.  Oh, I used french toast bread instead of regular bread as well.  It was still delicious.

Beautiful dessert.  Used flake for fresh, ditched the extra egg yolk and 1T of the sugar.  Could have even used less sugar for maximum devourability, but still lovely to eat.

Was a hit and is good warm or cold.  Made a few changes to use what I had on hand. Used  regular croissants, only 1 can coconut milk and regular  2% milk for the balance and added fresh blueberries.   A keeper !

I really loved this recipe, which I found after searching snacks with coconut milk as an ingredient. I made this for my book club. It was my first time ever making a bread pudding, and I think I did pretty well! I got the bread from the bakery sliced up into small pieces just for the recipe. Since they didn't have any day-old bread they recommended I stick the pieces in the oven at 350 for a short while. I did so with the fresh french bread in a 9x13 glass pan for 15 minutes and it dried the bread up to a great day-old consistency.
Also omitted the fresh coconut and used more shredded coconut.
Next time I am going to review the reviews (ha!) and add raisins, more flavor options, etc to give the dish some more interest.

I am obsessed with bread pudding and coconut so I was really excited to try this, but unfortunately for me it was just OK. It was a tad greasy and not very heavy on the coconut flavor. I may try this again with less coconut milk and maybe pineapple or banana added in.

This was so good and so easy, a big hit! I did leave out the fresh coconut but it didn't seem to be missing anything. It makes enough for eight people easily. But four of us devoured it. Mmmm so yummy!

Mmmmm....Beautiful! Don't know why I never thought of coconut in bread pudding before, but this is very tasty. When I made this tonight I added some pineapple tidbits with their juice like another reviewer said. I think it's a little acidic, so next time I will drain the pineapple. I halved the sugar and the the sweetness was perfect!

Amazing. Try toasting the coconut flakes before adding, gives a nice crunch. I also used the zest of one lime instead of the spices and reduced the sugar to our liking. Thank you!

The coconut gods are pleased (and so was my husband).   Be sure to cook this thoroughly and feel free to turn the bread a few times after starting to soak it.

I love this recipe. I used egg bread from Easter the first time and used fruit bread I got the second time and I’m making it now and I’m using cinnamon raisin bagels and strawberry bagels. I can’t wait to try it. Also when it is fresh out of the oven wait about 5 to 10 mins and then cut a piece and out whipped cream on it. That is to die for mmm.  Cheri Florida

I make something similar to this; but it's actually a rice pudding with coconut, cream, and condensed sweetened milk. It comes out tasting a little like flan custard, coconut butterscotch, and bread pudding. Next time I'll just make that.

My husband loves bread pudding and tries it everywhere we go. I have only made a traditional one once and decided to try this on Easter.  It was awesome!  I couldn't find coconut milk around here so I used sweetened condensed milk mixed with some plain milk...the coconut milk would have made it even better.  I will definately be making this again.

Great recipe for my first time making bread pudding! I substituted almond extract for coconut extract and used all flaked coconut rather than using 1/2 cup of the fresh stuff.

I served it with whipped cream with a bit of almod extract mixed in and it was delicious.

I love bread pudding and this was excellent. I do have to admit though that it was way too sweet for me. Next time I'll put less sugar. Thanks for the recipe

I never understand why people who change the recipe give a negative review?

I had to make one change- I didn’t have real coconut on hand, so I had to omit it, but the recipe was phenomenal without it!!

I served the bread pudding with warm homemade caramel sauce and whipped cream to a crowd, and let me tell you, it was a HIT!! 

Thank you so much for a great recipe!

We made it just like the recipe called for and loved it. We love desserts with coconut and this one is fabulous!

The coconut flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped (I love coconut!). I didn't have fresh coconut and used unsweetened instead, so that was probably the reason why. Next time I'll try it with real coconut.

This is a good recipe, but for all of the expense, it is not as good as the Bread Pudding II recipe.

My family really liked this.  I didn't have coconut extract, so I added vanilla instead.  I also didn't want to bother with the fresh coconut so I added a bit more sweetened flaked coconut as well as about a 1/3 of a can of cream of coconut.  I think next time I will add the coconut extract as it could've used just a little bit more of a 'kick' of coconut flavor.  The toasted coconut on top really did the trick for me - very good!

I made only half-portion in 8x8 glass form, omitted the extra egg yolk and also used flaked coconut instead of fresh. It was good but not to die for, especially considering the time it takes from start to end - almost 2 hours.
