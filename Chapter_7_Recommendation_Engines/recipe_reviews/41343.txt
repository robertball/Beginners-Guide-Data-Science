I LOVE my lunch! The beaten egg white makes this really light and poofy and being that for myself, I always have a carton of egg substitute on hand, this was right up my street. I added chopped spinach, brushetta and parm cheese. I was a happy girl this afternoon, but not as happy as I am tonight watching "Will and Grace". Water anyone?

Very tasty. I, too, used real eggs, and I used 5 instead of 4. Instead of water, I did about 2/3 cup skim lactose-free milk and I added the lactose-free cheese right into the egg mixture. Instead of making an omelet, however, I poured the egg mixture over the veggies after I was done sauteeing them, and ended up scrambling it all together. It was very tasty, and this is a great ingredients combination. I ended up using a touch more pepper and oregano since I had the extra egg. We ate this with spicy cubed potatoes and it made for a great dinner.

I altered this recipe... instead of baking, I sauteed the veggies and just poured the egg mixture overtop. I added the cheese just as the eggs were finished cooking. This is really good!!!I also just used whole eggs instead of egg whites and substitute.

Great omelet.  I cheated and used real eggs, though.

I dont know how I feel about this.  The omlet was super fluffy, but I don't like the crust it had - it was hard to cut through, just really tough.  But that might be due to the type of pan I put it in?  I'd rather have the veges cooked in with the egg than put between it.  I made this without cheese for my dad, who hates cheese; maybe this would have been better with it in.  It definitely needs seasoning though, regardless.

Excellant and easy to make. Will definitely make this one again. It's really good with some crunchy toast and made for a nice light supper.
