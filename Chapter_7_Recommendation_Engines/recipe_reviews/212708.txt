My family was delighted with the squash! I made a few changes in technique. I salted the squash, as another reviewer suggested and also flipped the squash, so that the acorn "bowl" was in the water. I soaked the raisins in 1/2 cup of hot apple juice and then added the apple juice to the apple mixture. Also, I scooped the squash from the acorn and added it to the apple mixture. It was delicious. My brother was literally scraping his acorn "bowl".

this was delicious. the cheese had me wondering, but it ended up making a gooey, tasty filling for the squash. only thing i will do different next time is to hit the squash with a bit of salt before i put the filling. great recipe!!

Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing. The only thing I changed was that I took the squash out and placed it in a baking dish. I made an indention in the center and placed the filling inside. Yummy.

Yummy. I added bacon bits! Tricky part was separating the rind and the squash.

I loved it! I have to echo the hesitation about the cheddar cheese, but I used less than was suggested and it really just added to the consistency, though I didn't taste much in the flavor. I used dried cranberries and honey instead of the brown sugar. Scooped out the majority of the squash and mixed with the apple mixture, just for ease. Was very happy with the result, even my friend who really doesn't like cheese was happy with it. Yummy vegetarian meal!

Absolutely wonderful.  My only twist was adding some pepperoni to offset the sweetness and microwaving it to cut the cook time.  Cut in half, seeded, 1.5 inches of water in a bowl and placed it cut side down.  Used a fork and poked the skin a bit and 15-20 in the microwave.  While it was cooking I prepped the rest and turned on the oven to 350.  Once completed almost all the water had either absorbed or evaporated.  I stuffed it and put it in the oven so that the cheese would melt.  I saw some people mentioning that they were skeptical of the cheese, but it makes the dish gooey.  Delicious!

This was very good. It was my first attempt at any kind of acorn squash and I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't change the technique other than using the grill rather than the oven. We had a whole bag of golden delicious so I used one of those and since I don't like raisins, I used dried cranberries instead. This will be repeated for sure.

I left out the raisins and added some parboiled beets to the apple mixture - it turns everything a beautiful colour and looks stunning against the squash! My husband, who generally hates veggie dishes, said this was one of his favourite foods of all time.

I loved this. The only two changes I made were to scoop the cooked squash out of their bowls and add that to the cooked apple and onion mixture. I did this because I knew none of the other eaters would actually eat the squash if prepared as directed. I added about a half teaspoon of salt to the mix because I forgot to salt the squash when baking during the first part. All of the ingredients added to the overall taste, so I wouldn't eliminate anything. Served with roast pork, everyone loved it!

I love this recipe, but do yourself a favor and add quinoa to the mix! It adds dimension, protein, and it acts as a binding agent for the other fillers! I also add walnuts to mine and sub the raisins for craisins.

After cutting in half and removing the seeds I did one half sprinkling with pumpkin spice and the filling on the recipe. The other I followed the recipe but also used pancake syrup poured into the cavity before placing the filling into place. Both were excellent.

The author of this recipe states that they have it every year on Thanksgiving, and now I can see why. This is a very hearty and sweet dish that is also very filling and tasty. I do agree with others that this is on the sweeter end of things, however it pairs well with a spicy dish such as the Cherry Bomb Chicken recipe found on this site. I did make this recipe exactly as it is written, but for those of you looking for something a little less sweet I would suggest cutting back on the apple and adding some rice to the stuffing; this should help balance out some of the sweetness without taking too much away.

Made it exactly as directed with only the addition of salt and pepper.  In a word delicious.  I love it, hubby loved it and our house guesst said "this is really good".  I too was a little afraid of the cheese in this but that in my opinion put it over the top. Next time, and there will be a next time, I would cube the squash and serve it all in a bowl because a whole 1/2 of squash stuffed was alot and hard to eat with the peel on and trust me you want to gobble it up.

This was wonderful.  I made it exactly according to the recipe, adjusted to 2 servings.  My husband loves acorn squash, but I have never cared for it.  Well, I loved this recipe, and he was positively ecstatic over it.  This is the only way I will prepare acorn squash in the future, and he will get his favorite squash much more often.

This recipe gave me a good base to make the stuffing.  I have used red apples or Asian pears as a substitute. I also have used both fresh or dried cranberries for the stuffing compote instead of raisins, delicious!

I have made this twice now. The first Time I made it I did not mix up the ingredients properly but it still tasted good. The second time Everything went well. Very good taste to. A little bit sweet but not a lot. I did add more cheese to the top of it when I put it in the oven the second time. I liked it this way a little better. I will be making it again.

We love this squash.  When I didn't have granny smith apples, I've used a sweeter apple and added in dried cranberries for a nice, tart flavor.

I made it as directed but added cranberries. We found the onion too strong and I would exclude it next time, just apples with the squash would be best for us.

As written I'd give this 4 1/2 but that option isn't available and I don't think it's quite worth 5. The first time I made this I didn't change a thing  but I didn't like the cheese on it. Normally, I love cheese on just about everything but it didn't fit with this recipe at all. The second time I subbed the raisins with dried cranberries, addex a little sea salt and omitted the cheese. Absolutely delicious.  Perfect

I made this tonight and liked it very much. Next time, I would try it  with buttercup squash for a more robust flavor. I served it with a grilled , marinated chicken breast.  It would go nicely with a grilled steak with blue cheese crumbles to add some depth to the already wonderful fall favors. Baking time was a bit longer than the recipe called for in my experience.

I wish I had read reviews before I made this! It desperately needed salt. Even with the salt, I feel like it was missing something savory. When I figure out what that something is I’ll make it again! The flavors were yummy, just a little something was missing.

This was pretty good except for the onions. They don't belong. If I made it again I would use more brown sugar and omit the onions. The cheese is also a little odd but not as offensive.

This is delicious and very versatile!  I used half the brown sugar, and cranberries instead of raisins, which I soaked in about 2 tablespoons of hot apple cider while the squash was cooking, and then added all of it to the stuffing.  I also salted the squash bowls lightly before stuffing.  For final prep, scrapped the squash out, chopped it up a bit and mixed it in with the stuffing.  The squash absorbed the apple cider, and it made a wonderful fall dinner.  I did salt and pepper quite a bit while eating though, so the next time I plan on adding a little more salt, and maybe a dash of chipotle pepper or some other spicy seasoning to give it more of a savory, hot sweet taste.

To make the dish a bit more savory I added bacon to the recipe. This way I was also able to skip the margarine and use some of the bacon rendering to cook the onion and apples.

I loved this recipe and found that it was made even better by using fresh orchard picked apples. I did not use onion but instead used onion powder for the pop of savory flavor.

I halved the recipe. The timing was off for baking the acorn squash. It called for 40 minutes and I had to put it in  for another 20 minutes before it was done. I added crasins and walnuts to the apple mix at equal parts as the raisins before filling the squash with it. It was ok, but I think it would be better if butternut squash were used instead of acorn squash. Then instead of filling the whole of the acorn cut the butternut into same size pieces as the apples and also equal amount as apples.

This was delicious and my husband has asked for it again. My only criticism is that the squash needed much more time in the oven before it was cooked. The next time I make it I will bake it cut side up and covered with foil.

Will definitely make it again. Read through a lot of reviews first. Squash is a bland vegetable. I don’t understand the complaint, but I did salt my squash before adding the stuffing. I precooked my squash ( after clearing it) in the microwave. Sautéed the onions and apples and added some cinnamon. As someone suggested I added some cooked brown rice( the rice was cooked in apple juice) and dried cranberries  to the apple mixture. Omitted the cheese and any other sugar. Before serving I put the squash in the microwave for 5 minutes on medium. The microwave works better/faster when cooking for one. If you make several, then the oven makes more sense. Will make this again . I can see adding pecans in the future.

This was great. I left the skin on the apples, added cranberries, and added the squash to the filling then filled the bowls. This would be wonderful with sausage. Going to the store in the AM to get sausage to add to the left overs. Will be AMAZING.

I scrapped the cooked squash from the shell, put in a 9X9 pan and topped with the apple mixture. I added only 1/2 cup cheese as I was not sure about how it would taste. I didn't like it. I could taste the cheese and I don't think it went well with the squash. Overall I think the dish lacked flavor. I squash was bland because the mixture just sat on top. The squash needs to be seasoned with salt, pepper, maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, or something! And maybe mix the apple mixture in, but skip the cheese. However, as written, 3 stars- it was just ok.

So I love this recipe! My husband liked it but thought the raisins made it too sweet. So I cheated and microwaved the squash. After it was done, I shipped the squash and mixed it together with the apple mixture and cooked it in a 12 x12. I wouldn't change a thing!

I cut the recipe to 4 servings using only 2 acorn squash and they were not even remotely close to be cooked after 45 minutes.  Either allow a full hour or more for the squash or be prepared to have to microwave the halves for another 10 minutes or so.  After all that work, I found these rather bland and tasteless and won't be repeating. Hubby loves squash so he was happy enough and that's why I gave this recipe 3 stars.  Otherwise, it would have been only 1 from me.

This was okay, but a little plain on the first try. The 2nd time, I added some seasoning salt and fresh cracked pepper to the squash generously before filling with the onions, apples, etc. I also added Craisins since I had no golden raisins. I added a pinch of nutmeg, which I felt was a nice addition. Also, I changed the cheese to jack cheese - cheddar just didn't seem right to me. With the new additions, I received rave reviews. But, with these changes, it actually was quite tasty. I will make it again - with the changes, of course.

It was good.  If I were making it again, I would caramelize the onions and cook the apples after.  I'd also increase the raisins and bump up the spices with cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, or similar.  You could make it non fat by leaving off the cheese and sautéing the onions in a little wine.

This smelled lovely while baking!  The filling was tasty, but the squash was unseasoned so it came out bland.  Next time I will roast the squash, score it and season liberally, and then fill with the apple mixture.

We loved this recipe! It is wonderful mix of sweet and savory and the varying textures are nice also. Next time I may add some browned breakfast sausage to make it more of an entree, as opposed to a side dish.

The only changes I made were to substitute dried cherries for raisins and I drizzled the stuffed squash with 1 Tbs. cinnamon-pear infused balsamic vinegar per half. Excellent recipe. I think this is the first time I have made a stuffed vegetable recipe where the amount of stuffing was perfect! I would serve with a whole grain dish flavored with sage.

Loved this. I only had cran rasins so I used those and reduced the brown sugar. Yummy  also I cut the half in half for a more reasonable serving size.

Acorn squash is a veggie that cooks so well in the microwave which saves a ton of time and cost. I did it all except the cheese in the microwave, start with ten minutes, it may require a few more , then added the cheese and broiled for a few minutes. Fabulous!!

My whole family agreed that if we just tossed some walnuts in the filling, it would be a perfect vegetarian entree. This was insanely good. I did use 1 cup of extra sharp block cheddar so I cannot attest to the "gooey" cheese binding, but otherwise I made it as directed. My husband kept eating the filling before I could even stuff the halves! I would have given it five stars, except that even on a lower setting and sharing the oven with a turkey, my squash did not take 40 minutes to cook so my end result was, for my taste, a little softer than I'd have liked. But the presentation was beautiful and it was delicious!

My kids and husband loved it. My son is a picky eater when it comes to vegetables. I am making it again tonight. I used craisins instead of golden raisins because it was what I had on hand. I omitted the cheese.

Wonderful recipe… everyone loved it… I only used 2 acorn squash and I used 1/2 and 1/2 butter and evoo… I also used craisins instead of raisins… I also followed the suggestion to scoop out the squash and place in a casserole if serving a lot of people… and I added the nutmeg which someone else suggested… all in all.. this will be a staple in my recipe box… I made both parts ahead of time(except for the cheese) as we had to drive a long way and wanted to just get there and bake it… worked out great…mixed the topping with the cheese… placed it on top of the squash and baked… everyone raved…

I followed recipe exactly. We loved the texture of the filling but it was too sweet for us. I might add bacon and not add cinnamon or sugar next time as the raisins and apple provide enough sweetness for my family.

I used a vidalia onion and omitted the raisins. I also added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. My husband said it was the BEST squash he had ever eaten, and his mom was a wonderful Italian cook! Will Definetely make again and again.

I used regular raisins and a red delicious apple since that is what I had.  I microwaved the cut squash with some water in the baking dish for about 15 min, and was able to scoop much of the flesh out to mix in with the rest.  My husband thought this tasted like apple pie.  I thought it was good enough to use again if our neighbor presents us with another acorn squash(like in this case), but I don't think I would seek it out.

At first I did not think that these ingredients of sweet and savory really went together, but it turned out sooooooo delicious.  I did substitute raisins for dried cranberries and use whatever apples I had on hand.  I also used natural unprocessed cane sugar rather than the brown sugar.  Yummm!

Loved this.  I scraped it out of the squash mixed all and put in a baking dish and adjusted to just one acorn squash for my husband and I. Delicious. Also microwaved the squash for 10 minutes cut in half in 1/4 cup water.  Saved time and scooped right out!  Awesome recipe.

It was delicious. I only did one squash and reduced the recipe to about:
2 small empire apples
1 tsp brown sugar
dash of cinnamon
1/4 c onion
1/4 cheese
Next time I would add a little more chees and I think the filling would be great with a little sausage crumbled up in it.

tasted great over pork the next night, I took the squash out of the shell and mashed it with butter, brown sugar, etc. and made an excellent second meal!

I thought the recipe was too much work for the end result - an okay taste.

This is only the 3rd time I have ever prepared acorn squash for a meal because squash is just not my favorite, so perhaps the recipe is not the problem.  Maybe my taste-buds are the problem! But here are my thoughts and observations using this recipe.

I followed the recipe as written with a couple of exceptions.  After 40 minutes of baking, my squash halves were still too hard, so I ended up baking them for 60 minutes total before the meat was soft enough to remove.

I substituted Craisins for the raisins because that's what I had on hand.

Another reviewer mentioned that the recipe might have been better with something crunchy included, so I added some pecans.  

The preparation took much longer than I expected, but just cutting the squash and removing seeds and strings took me 30 minutes.  If I had a video of my squash cutting time I could send it to "America's Funniest Home Videos"!  All I can say is that I'm very happy to still have 10 fingers!  

Another reviewer suggested microwaving the squash first to make them softer and easier to cut in half.  I would definitely do that if I were to make this recipe again.  

In the end, I didn't much care for the taste.  I ate it, but I kept thinking that my time could have better been spent making a different vegetable, and the calories could have gone toward something I enjoyed.  No disrespect intended cksmom1.  Most reviewers really liked the recipe.

This was really good. Like the others, I was a bit iffy on the cheese but it turned out great. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. The only other thing I would change would be to add some nuts or something crunchy - it lacked a bit of texture for my liking. But great flavour and pretty easy also!

I really like the flavors of this dish, but I think next time I will scoop out the squash flesh and mix it with the apple mixture, then put it back in the shell for the final cooking. I think it will integrate better and also be easier to eat. Thanks for something different from the same old butter/brown sugar squash recipe.

I never made anything with acorn squash before and I was pleasantly surprised how great this was. I didn't have onions so I used leeks, and I added a dash of nutmeg. I also used Monterey Jack/ cheddar cheese and it was fantastic. Thank you so much!!

I made this for Thanksgiving (we celebrate it in October in Canada!) and everyone really liked it! The only change I made was dried cranberries instead of raisins. The cinnamon and apple combination was yummy. It also reheats well if there are left overs, we made WAY too much food so I had a few halves left. I just threw some extra cheese on top and broiled it for a few minutes to brown the cheese and it was still delicious a few days after the dinner. My boyfriend even took it too work and ate it cold for lunch the next day and said it was still really good.

It tastes like Apple meets Pumpkin Pie!! Loved this!! I was unsure of this given the mix of ingredients but it is different and delicious! My only change was to use Carnival Squash ( looks like a mini pie pumpkin) that I microwaved for about 8 minutes so that I could slice through it easily and without injury and then followed the rest of the recipe ( I always pierce and microwave winter squash before cutting/slicing). I cannot wait to make this one again.

So good!  I shared this recipe with another foodie friend and he'd already tried it and loved it as well!
