Great combination of two American classics! I had leftover meatloaf from "Cottage Meatloaf" from this site and since I was down to my last slice I thought I'd give this recipe a try and I'm glad I did. I typically have my meatloaf sandwich cold so this was a nice change of pace. I used thick cut white bread and opted for a mayo vs. mustard. I left the cheese off the outside of the bread as I thought that as a bit of cheese "overkill". It went great with a side of kettle cooked chips and a dill pickle.  If you love meatloaf and you love grilled cheese this recipes is a definite must try!

I just made this sandwich for my son (adult) and he loved it.  He said he’d try it & was giving me his opinion while he tasted. When his review was over, sandwich was gone *poof*.  Now I have to make myself one!  The only change I made was I eliminated the mustard, only because I was out. As he wiped his mouth, my Son said “great meatloaf delivery system” Mom!  I believe that was a compliment

This was a great way to use up a little bit of leftover meatloaf. The crispy cheese on the outside isn't necessary but provides a nice flavor. I cut some little pieces and flipped the sandwich over on top of them to brown.

Hubby bit into this sandwich and immediately asked for another!  I made very slight changes to this recipe:  I did use not use ketchup (personal preference) nor did I add the cheese to the outside.   I did use:  spicy deli mustard, thick white bread and mild cheddar.   Delicious!!!

I love grilled cheese sandwiches AND I love meatloaf sandwiches, so I knew this was gonna be a winner! Super simple to make and great flavor combo. I think next time I'm gonna make it with all the cheese on the inside b/c for some reason, I felt that the cheese on the outside made the bread soften up. I will def be making this yumminess again! Thanks for sharing. :)
