This is definitely a classic pound cake recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked it in a 9x5 inch glass baking dish.  Mine took 1 hour and 10 minutes with no raw center.  It was light, fluffy, and moist.  It's perfect for stawberry shortcake and the slices freeze well.  Be sure to whip the egg whites until they form stiff white peaks - it makes a difference.  I couldn't believe how light and fluffy my pound cake turned out because of it.

This is one of the better basic pound cakes I have had on this site.   A lot of complaints about dryness, well if you use butter, beat thoroughly and only beat egg whites until they hold soft peaks it should not be dry.   Actually it tastes better after it sits a day. Thanks for submitting.

I love this cake!!  this is my first attempt at making pound cake, and I'm happy to say it turned out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly, and yes, the egg whites must be whipped to form soft peaks, don't leave out any of the steps, and you will be happy with the results.  I used a Pyrex 8x4 loaf pan, and baking time was 1 hour and 20 minutes, just make sure you test it by inserting a toothpick in the center of the cake, and if it comes out clean then you can be sure the center is not raw.  This cake is delicious, thank you for the recipe!!

This came out lovely! I am using it for Baked Alaska so I used a pie pan in place of the loaf pan. For the size change only a 40 minute baking time was needed. Thank you!!! (any first timers, like me, should not be alarmed at thickness of batter)

This cake was amazing! Def. a family favorite because it is so light and fluffy -- BUT you might need to bake it a little bit longer  'cause the middle of mine was barely cooked! But overall a wonderful find!

I have made this pound cake many times, and it has always tasted great! Something that you might want to do though is add a little lemon and orange zest(1 tsp). It makes the the cake taste even better!

I followed the directions exactly because I was giving it as a present.  Seems kind of dry and bland...not very special at all.  I had high hopes because of the high star rating, but was disappointed.

I don't know what I did wrong, because I followed the instructions in this recipe step by step, but the middle of my cake came out raw.

A very tasty cake.  If you have trouble with an under done center, do not preheat your oven.  This allows the center to get done before the sides get too brown and dry.

I was a little worried about the thickness of the batter but it turned out very well although it took 10 minutes more to bake.
