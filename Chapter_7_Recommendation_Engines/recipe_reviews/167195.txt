Not a bad recipe, but I agree with one of the other reviewers: that the variety spices were virtually indestinguishable from the balsamic.  (I used a high-quality balsamic, maybe that's why)

I'd recommend the following additions/changes:
-5-6 cloves of fresh garlic
-Soy sauce (1/4 cup or so)
-a bit of brown sugar

Tasty!  thank you!

This popped into my email as a new recipe and I had chicken in the fridge so I tried it last night.  I'm glad I did!  It was so easy to marinate during the day - pop it into the oven and you have a great weeknight meal.  While it was baking I could work on the other dishes.  I did not use red pepper flakes and used fresh rosemary and fresh garlic.  My husband said "wow, this is good!".  Make this dish!

I used fresh garlic and put bread crumbs on the chicken before baking. (Baked on a cooling rack to keep the bread crumbs from getting soggy on the bottom.) Otherwise, I was faithful to the recipe, and my husband and I were both in agreement that the chicken was very moist and flavorful.

I have two big improvements on the recipe.
1.  Braise the breasts in a frying pan first, then put them in the oven in the pan.  Shorten the cooking time to 11 minutes per side.

2.  For heaven sakes, don't throw out the marinade.  Put all of it, herbs, onions, everything, into a saucepan with 2 cups of dry white wine.  Boil this down to a thin syrup, strain, and serve drizzled on top of the sliced breasts or as a dipping sauce.

You can vary the ingredients of the marinade.  I left out the rosemary, used miren instead of water, added dry mustard and a splash of Worcestershire.

I love balsamic vinegar, but one of these spices doesn't belong and I think it's the chili powder.  Next time, I'll omit that.  Instead of water, I added 1/4 c. of olive oil and used fresh minced garlic instead of dried.  I let this marinate for four hours (could have used more time).  We grilled these and they came out nice.  The combination of balsamic and the heat from the red pepper flakes was a nice change.

We were so sick of tasteless chicken that when this came into my email as a new recipe, I just had to try it.  I didn't have the rosemary nor the parsley flakes but I had everything else.  It has a tang and wonderful taste that is completely different. My husband has already asked when I will make this again.  Soon, honey.

Just finsihed this dish and it was de-lish!  I basically followed recipe with the exception of substituting the water for chicken stock plus I had no rosemary on hand. I marinated 5 hours then seared the outside of the breasts and  transfered to a baking dish and poured some of the marinade ontop. Baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes ( I baked 2 breasts). I let the meat rest for about 5 minutes and then sliced and put over salad with 1/2 baked sweet potato. Leftover marinade I poured into a small sauce pan reduced over med heat. Was great for dipping and whisking  with olive oil as a salad dressing and drizzled ontop of everything. YUM! Hubby loved it and I will def. be making this again! oh yeah, the cayenne MAY be a little too much for some. If you are sensitive to any "after" heat, you may want to reduce cayenne.

I did not have the minced onion, so I used dried chives I had.  I did use fresh garlic also.  Other than that 1/2 the recipe for 2 split breasts in the oven and basted with the marinade.  I had marinated in the fridge for 1 hour.  I love it... It was great flavor..

What an excellent recipe!  I made this tonight for my boyfriend and it was a complete success!  The only thing I did different was to only use 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, use italian seasoning in place of the oregano, rosemary, and parsley, added fresh garlic, and a splash of OJ.  Let marinate overnight, and cooked at 350 for about 30-35 minutes.  The chicken was wonderfully moist, and so tasty.  My bf remarked he could taste many different flavors in the chicken as well.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you for the recipe!

Fabulous!  Marinated for about two hours, and then grilled on the BBQ on med-low for 30 minutes - moist and full of flavor - entire family loved it!

Nice, tangy flavor. Next time, I'll try marinating it longer to let the flavors develop a little more. I paired this with the Almond Rice Pilaf from this site.

this dish is very nice. i didnt have regular balsamic, so i used white balsamic, which has a milder flavor which i preferred anyway because i think the regular balsamic would have made it a little too strong. i tweaked some ingredients too. instead of dried onion i used onion powder (fresh onion would probably work well too) and 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic instead of dried. i marinated it overnight and then barbequed it and it was very juicy and my dad even liked it, and he is incredibly picky. i will definitly make this again! :)

I pounded my chicken breasts with a tenderizing mallet before throwing them in the marinade. I used organic chicken broth instead of plain water and because a lot of the reviews claimed that you can't taste the spices over the balsamic (which is very true if you use a quality balsamic), I doubled most of the spices and I only used a pinch of salt. I used fresh minced garlic as well. I did marinate the meat most of the day. The chicken was very moist and flavorful and three out of four of us liked it. I'm glad I made the adjustments I did.

I recommend this chicken recipe.  It was easy and yummy.  I used fresh garlic and omitted the pepper flakes and rosemary since I didn't have any.  Also, I used Italian seasoning whose main ingredient is oregano instead of plain oregano, since, amazingly enough I didn't have any.  My husband who doesn't like vinegar of any kind and rarely comments on my cooking said it was good.  Really high praise from him.   I have saved this and will make it again for sure.  Oh, yeah, and I grilled it instead of baking it.

Found this recipie this afternoon and had everything on hand and was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this marinated ! It only marinated for a mere 3 hours but tasted like it had been days! My husband was a huge fan and so was I. Quick and easy prep and cooked up perfectly tender and juicy. I added a tablespoon of honey to add a little extra sweetness as well. We will be making this again !

everyone in my family loved this recipe! i had just a few alterations: I marinated the chicken almost 24 hours in advance because i find it more conveniant to start it the night b4. i only cooked the chicken for 25 miinutes and i think i could have taken it out at 20 because it was already just a tad dry next time will cook on a slightly lower setting. But It was extreamly flavorful and delicious. although, i do agree with some of the other reviewers that not all the spices are needed because the vinager takes over the flavor. but I could taste the spicier flavors (such as the crushed pepper and chili powder) and they gave it a little kick so I would definitely keep those in. I might do without some of the other spices in the future though to keep the cost down. will for sure be making this again! Its a keeper.

Didn't like this as much as another balsamic vinegar chicken I found off this site, which is basically sauteed onions, freshly diced tomatoes, basil, garlic, brown sugar, ground pepper and of course, balsamic vinegar and chicken.  This one was okay, but bland.  I had added some soy sauce and brown sugar per some other reviews and omitted the chili stuff to suit children's tastes.

AWESOME! I just finished eating this for a great lunch. I only wanted to use what I had on hand. So I pulled 1 chicken breast out of the freezer and tossed it in a ziploc bag with the marinade.  I didn't have dried onion, rosemary, or parsley, and I don't care for oregano. So I replaced them all with a tsp of Mrs. Dash table blend. I halved the red pepper flakes, used 2 tsp fresh minced garlic, omitted the salt, and kept the remaining ingredients as written. Since my chicken was frozen I left it out instead of putting it into the fridge. After an hour I added 1/2 onion and 1/2 orange bell pepper, both chopped. Then I left it to marinate for another hour. I baked it in a covered Corningware dish, instead of baking uncovered. I preheated the oven to 350 degrees, strained the marinade into a small sauce pot, and put the chicken, onions, and peppers into the baking dish.  Baked for 40 minutes, covered the whole time.  While that was in the oven, I reduced the marinade on a low simmer for 30 minutes (reduced volume by half.)  The balsamic vinegar became a bit sweet and the tangy-ness mellowed out. Delicious! I wisked in one tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil to use it as a salad dressing. I topped a large bowl of mixed greens with a few tablespoons of the warm "dressing," letting the greens wilt a little bit. I topped it with half of the peppers, onions, and chicken. yum! Next time I will probably cut the vinegar just a tad and replace it with water or OJ. Thanks to R.Upchurch!

Very tasty and juicy!  Followed the recipe exactly, and left to marinate about 2 hours.  I think it could use a little more garlic, and chili powder too, but overall it was a nice, healthy meal.

My husband likes dark meat, so I was looking for a marinade for the legs and thighs I was grilling for dinner. I made this exactly like the recipe, other than swapping out fresh rosemary and oregano just because they are growing on my back deck. Marinated chicken for about 2 hours and threw it on the grill. I don't like dark meat chicken, but I could have eaten the skin off of the whole 2 lbs of chicken! It was crispy and tasted glazed, so yummy. The meat was super juicy, my husband ate some cold for breakfast this morning. This will be my go to chicken marinade from now on.

Looks great I have a variation I like....I keep the marinade and put the whole thing in a meatloaf pan. 350 for 30 to 35 minutes. Keeps it moist and wonderful. The marinade pretty much cooks off and leave with a clear brown fluid remaining so I know its done if its not cloudy. A few spatterings of vinegar here an dthere I drain and eat the whole  chicken breast myself like a pig. A bit of Pik-a-Peppa sause and Im in heaven....

The entire family really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it as is, but cooked it for 35 min at 350 degrees.  Extremely moist, very flavorful.  Husband asked for more red pepper flakes next time.  Also, I believe I would marinate even longer than I did (2 hrs).

This marinade is amazing! It tastes like Chiavetta's marinade from my hometown of Buffalo, NY - liquid gold! If you are using this marinade remove the skin of the chicken so the marinade can soak into the meat and marinade it overnight if you can.

I added:
4 garlic cloves minced
1/2 t fresh chopped parsley
1/2 shallot finely diced
1 T honey
1/4 C olive oil
1/4 C water
I took out:
water
dried garlic, dried parsley, dried onion

It just gave this recipe a "fresher" flavour

This was DELICIOUS! I used 1 1/4 cup of good balsamic vinaigrette rather than balsamic vinegar and water. I didn't add the paprika or the chili powder, but I doubled the red pepper flakes since we like spicy, and used 4 cloves of fresh garlic that I minced. I also added some thyme, just for extra flavor. I let this refrigerate overnight, came out fantastic and I will DEFINITELY make this again!

This was good.  Some of the fam loved it, all liked it.  Next time I'd add a bit of sugar to cut the vinegar taste just a tad, and maybe cook the marinade to get more of the flavors to mix - just boil it a bit on the stove and then allow to cool.  But really, it's very good.

I have NEVER written a review before but for the first time felt I had to.  I consider myself a good cook and have 30+ years behind me.  I must also say that I LOVE Balsamic Vinegar which is why I even tried this recipe in the first place.  However, this recipe was INEDIBLE!!!  I was very disappointed.

I don't think I let these marinate long enough. I marinated them for about an hour and most of the flavor seemed to cook off. I liked the flavor on the parts where I could taste it. Next time I'll let them sit in the marinade all day, or use it on chicken that has skin.

I loved this recipe.. however I did make some changes. I used onion powder in place of dried onion, added a bit of olive oil, and used fresh minced garlic. Also, I lined the cooking sheet with cubed red potatoes, cherry tomatoes, and brussel sprouts that I covered lightly in olive oil, salt and pepper and baked before hand for 20 min at 425°. Then topped with this marinated chicken and baked the time it called for. So good!

I used half golden balsamic and half dark balsamic. Not a favorite of mine. The balsamic flavor is rather strong. And as others have already said, the spices don't rise above that vinegar flavor.

I like the marinade ingredients and proportions.  That being said - it would definitely have to marinate a minimum of overnight AND 400 degrees for 40 minutes is WAAAAAAY too long - I tried it - dry and flavorless...350 for 25-25 would be fine...I might also pierce the meat prior to cooking to let the flavor penetrate!

Way too dry.  Nice flavor, but I have to question baking at 400 for 40 minutes.  I think 25-30 minutes would have worked better.  And maybe add some marinade part way thru.  And I agree with other reviews that some fresh garlic and herbs would be more flavorful.

So good! Our toddlers even loved it. I will make this again, very flavourful. I used mostly fresh instead of the dried ingredients. My oven obviously cooks faster, so next time I will reduce the oven temperature and/or cooking time, as they were overdone.

Very good recipe. I used the probe to make sure the chicken was done at 165 degrees. Next time, I hope to marinate overnight :)

Very moist- you can cut it with a fork! Pounded the chicken first, then marinated for a day.  Decided to put some breadcrumbs on the chicken before baking. It has a tangy, vinegar taste (like some barbecue sauces).  Try this on top of a pile of salad greens.  Yum.

Awesome!  I used reduced fat balsamic vinegarette and just added a splash of water.  I didn't have any onion or red pepper flakes, so I just omitted those.  It was really delicious and juicy!  I only had to bake it for 25 min.

I followed the recipe to the T.  Marinated it for 24 hours.... we didn't care for it much.....all we tasted was the balsamic vinegar....not sure why I had to add all those herbs and spices to the marinate....they were indiscernible... ........won't make this again.

I felt that based on other's reviews the amount of balsamic vinegar might be a little much, so I did cut it down a little and kept everything else the same. Was able to taste some of the spices in the mix. we had 2 boneless breasts to marinate and they were well received by all of us. Thanks for a good recipe.

This is a very flavorful marinade that leaves the chicken moist and yummy!! Very easy too. Like other reviewers I too left out the chili powder and I didn't have red pepper flakes so I substituted red pepper which worked out fine. 

I was also .pressed for time so didn't really let the chicken sit in the marinade more than 15 minutes so its possible to have great flavor with that short a time as well although I'm sure it only gets better as it sits. 

This recipe is definitely a must add to the regular meal rotation!

If I ever prepare this recipe again, I will increase the spice ingredients significantly. I love balsamic vinegar and as the centerpiece of this marinade, it's fine. But the volume of other spices is so small that those flavors are barely discernible.

Balsamic Marinated Chicken Breast Haiku: "Too many spices, competing with each other. Taste was just alright." Followed recipe exactly, marinating overnight, and found that for the measuring of all of the spices and herbs, that many of their flavors just got lost in a deluge of one another, along w/ in the overwhelming balsamic flavor. And yes yes, I know that's the title of the recipe, and to expect that as a dominant flavor, but for all the great reviews here (many of which altered the original recipe), we just weren't all that impressed.

It tasted like balsamic vinager right out of the bottle. Too strong for me. The chicken also cooked in 30 min and was already starting to dry out. It would have been charcoal at 40 min as recommended. The marinade was incredibly runny and seeped under the tinfoil on the baking sheet and ruined it. Whatever the case, it wasn't a good situation overall. We ate the chicken with BBQ sauce to make it palatable.

This is a great recipe. The chicken breasts were definitely tender and juicy with lots of flavor. I marinated the chicken breasts overnight and then baked them when I got home from work. They tasted a little too vinegar-y for my family. Next time, I make them I will marinate them for less time, probably between 2-6 hours.

Entirely TOO strong and I only marinated for 40 minutes.  If you LOVE vinegar you will like this.  My advice is to not pound the chicken thin and to add some brown sugar or something to make it sweet rather than mouth-puckering tart.  I will not be making this again even with modifications.

Never again.... salty and strange flavored.  Maybe skip the chili powder?  But I'm not going to try and find out.

This is very tasty. I baked three 6 oz  breasts for only 20 min. and that was still too long. They turned out dry. I will try again. Very flavorful.

Nice change of pace with the flavor & easy to make. I left out the chili powder because I didn't have any on hand but with all the other spices, it wasn't noticeable. Will save & make again!

I'm so sorry to the original poster of this recipe, but ours turned out very poorly.  Not sure if it's cuz I used boneless, skinless thighs or that I marinated it for24hrs.  It was just too vinegary and almost tasted rancid.  I hate to leave a negative review, but I'm hoping it'll help others.  Perhaps not marinate so long and maybe it would be better with skin on chicken?  I followed the marinade recipe exxacctly.

The only change I made was I used fresh minced onion and garlic, but otherwise I followed this recipe. This is fantastic! It is a tasty, easy to make dish- I eat it once a week. The chicken turns out juicy and flavorful (I love the taste of the balsamic vinegar). Thank you for such an awesome dish.

I made this last night and it was delicious. Just wanted to share that my 19 month old daughter is in love with honey right now, so we dipped the cooked chicken in honey, and it was so good I just had to let everybody know.

This was very yummy.  The breasts were suprisingly juicy and tender and very flavorful.  My youngest son's girlfriend who doesn't eat chicken decided to try one and she ate the whole breast.

This was surprisingly good. I was worried about the balsamic being overpowering, but my husband said it was great. Nice and moist. The chicken was a strange colour, though, so I think I might use white balsamic next time. I baked for only 25 minutes, and that was perfect for medium size boneless skinless chicken breasts. I also used this marinade on large protobello mushrooms, which I then sliced thickly (after marinating for about 4 hours) and sauteed in a little butter and olive oil. They were scrumptious! Thanks!

I have a pretty open mind when it comes to food and I tried but just could not like this. The spices were a bit off and really overpowered  by the balsamic. I wanted to like these but alas. I appreciate the myriad of spices but they just didn't work. Thanks anyways.

It smelled lovely while cooking, but sadly I just didn't taste as much flavor in mine as I smelled cooking. I marinated it for around 24 hours (because that was convenient). Still, I must admit it was certainly a LOT tastier than if I'd baked it plain, so 4 stars it is!

I would rate this a 3 but others in my family enjoyed it so I figured it should get a 4.  I just was not a fan.  Not sure what my big complaint would be aside from just didn't enjoy it personally.

This recipe was delicious! I confess that I didn't have time to marinade the chicken ahead of time so I simply baked it in the marinade and flipped/reapplied more half-way through cooking, and it came out wonderfully. If you don't have time to marinade overnight, try my method and then use any extra for dipping.

I'm giving this a 4 because I didn't follow the directions and BBQed the chicken.  Unfortunately I think it took the taste away.  Next time I'll bake it and I bet it will turn out great!

Actually made this one as is (except I didn't have quite enough balsalmic).  Just ok, probably not a do againer.  It's pretty good, I just have a lot of other chicken marinades I prefer to this one.  Worth trying, just isn't for me!

The marinade was really good, and the chicken breasts smelled awesome while cooking. Mine only took 30 minutes, and, even then they were just a tiny bit over cooked. But my oven runs hot. I think the leftover chicken will be good on a salad or made into a vinaigrette chicken salad. I used fresh garlic instead of dried and dried basil instead of oregano.

Very easy to make and very tasty.  I put it in the oven with potato slices and a bit of the juice.  Will definitely make again.  Sent it over to my mom, too.

This chicken was good, but te balsamic flavor was a bit too strong (and I love balsamic vinegar).  I would have liked some other flavors, like fresh garlic, in there.  I boiled the leftover marinade, strained it, and served it over rice.  We had asparagus too.

I changed to onion and garlic powder because I was out of minced used 1 tbsp.  of each was very good. I will keep this one my grandson loves it. Also made 6 pieces of chicken breast. W ill try it with minced to see the difference. will add a picture next time.

not a bad recipe, simple and versatile, add or subtract ingredients  to your tastes. I did not discard the marinade, I instead strained out the solids and reduced the liquid by 1/2 and used that as a sauce over the top, delicious.

I made this for my family as a test before serving it for a dinner party.  I only marinated the chicken for a little over an hour before baking.  The chicken was moist and tender and tasted delicious.  It was a hit with my adult son and husband.  I will be serving it at our annual Christmas dinner party, but I'll marinate the meat overnight and add a bit more garlic.  I served it with long grain and wild rice and steamed vegetables.  For the dinner party, I'll be serving garlic angel hair pasta and a garden salad as side dishes.  Thanks for a good recipe!

We both loved this, I poured remaining marinade over the chicken prior to roasting it, and it was very moist and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again!  Different from the usual old chicken recipes...

Great recipes thanks- I just not sure why you discarded the marinade.  I made it in a cast iron skillet and cooked the marinade into a sauce after chicken was done

I rarely post reviews; this recipe turned out so bad - was compelled to write.
Chicken tasted like it had gone bad / rancid. The vinegar was overpowering and chicken lacked any flavor at all.
Hope this will save some of you out there the agony of trying this unpalatable dish.

Made it faithfully and was not disappointed, with one difference: instead if discarding the marinade, I used it to make white rice (replaced about half the water with marinade). It makes for a very flavorful rice that (of course!) pairs perfectly with the chicken.

Replace the chilli flakes with sriracha, reduce the balsamic vinegar and marinate for ten to twelve hours, it was awesome, and I will definitely make it again.

Maybe less balsamic less time, but it was fantastic! Super juicy! Make sure to wrap them in a paper towel if you prepped and decide to eat as a leftover.

try charcoal grilling!  reduce the marinade, serve over the grilled chicken.    Marinate chicken thighs, dredge in flour, then egg, and back to seasoned flour.  let the coated pieces "dry" on a rack and either fry or spray with cooking spray and use an air fryer.  Also marinated a pork loin before roasting.  This is a great multi-use marinade.

The chicken comes out very tender which is a good thing but I wasn't a fan of the taste. The balsamic is pretty strong so it leaves the balsamic taste. It over powers the over ingredients. Easy to prepare but won't be doing this one again.

Will use again. Used the cheaper Balsamic not the expensive, aged kind. I often like to use fresh garlic and herbs if I have them but decided to take the fast track with this, using all dried spices that I had on hand to see how it went and we were very pleased with the results. Used multiple ways and my picky husband loved it too!

I made this for the Mrs & mine weekly food prep. Cutting the chicken breast into chunks helps cut down on the cooking time and also helps keep it moist (in my opinion).  It falls apart in your mouth if done right. I opted for a lower temperature (since my oven is super small). Came out amazing!

I followed the recipe exactly and marinated for 6 hours. I was disappointed with the lack of flavor. I think this has potential so next time I intend to marinate overnight. I agree with what other said about the balsamic; it is the only flavor you can taste.

The vinegar taste was overwhelming.  I did marinate over night so that might of caused it.

I cannot say it's a bad recipe but I agree with many other reviewers: Adding spices makes no sense  since their taste was indistinguishably from the taste of balsamic vinegar. 
I did not like the recipe overall, it was way too sour for me

I used white balsamic vinegar. Turned out bland-ish, but that was probably because of my vinegar choice. Still turned out great, but I suggest regular balsamic vinegar. :)

This dish, which sounded so promising, was disappointing.   The vinegar taste was overpowering.  ( I let it marinate close to 24 hours and am wondering if it should have marinated for a shorter period of time. )  Fortunately barbecue sauce (and some sugar to counteract the vinegar's acidity) helped salvage the chicken.

I only marinated for 1 hour and it was a bit too bland for my taste.  I will try it again but I will marinate overnight and see how that works out.

Fantastic!  Great spice selections coupled with the tenderizing effects of the Balsamic were a magnificent complimentary pair!  These breasts served over long-grain brown rice with a cheesy broccoli on the side and a crusty loaf of bread............Heaven in Oklahoma!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made it exactly as written. Let the chicken breasts marinate for 30 minutes in a ziploc bag before cooking. Came out so moist and tasty. Can't wait to make again!

My entire family loved this dish. I marinated the chicken for about two hours. I will say I wish I had cooked it for about 36 minutes vs 40. It was a little dry for my liking, but no one else seemed to mind. Yum!

I made this dish according to the instructions.  Sadly, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  This dish was  bland and my family had to add a lot of seasoning salt for it to have any flavor.  I wont make this dish again unless I make significant modifications to the receipe.

We loved it!  Very easy to make.  I followed the recipe pretty close.  I used fresh finely chopped onion and 5 cloves of fresh minced garlic.  I browned the chicken breasts and placed them in the balsamic marinade for 30 minutes.  I then scooped out most of the minced onion and garlic from the marinade and spread it over the chicken and then placed in the oven.  I cooked 7 breasts for 40 minutes - perfect!

Made this recipe tonight.  I cut everything in half for one chicken breast.  I baked it in the marinade at 350degrees for 35 minutes and it came out perfect!  I really want to try this again and marinate it overnight!  thanks.

I haven't eating it yet. I do meal prep for lunches while at work. I used thin cut chicken breast, cook time 30 min. It looked and smelled sooooo good! Almost wanted to eat it right away. I only got to marinade it for a few hours so i will have to try it again overnight. I will most definitely use this recipe more!

I marinated for 3 days (oops! forgot about it in the fridge), and it was AMAZING. I fel like the balsamic overpowered most of the spices, but it could have been because I let it marinade for so long. This is a great recipe that I will definitely use again!!!

I made this yesterday and my husband loved it. I however, thought the balsamic was overwhelming.. I used fresh onion and garlic rather than minced. I'll definitely read through the reviews to find a variation that is a bit less vinagerie  because my husband wants it again soon.

This was sooooo good!!!! Taking the suggestion of another user, I doubled all of the dry ingredients. I let it marinate for about three hours, slapped them on the grill and ..... trust.... your taste buds will thank you for preparing this yummy dish !
Make sure you DOUBLE the dry ingredients. I could taste the ingredient blend with each bite.

Great recipe totally loved it. Ran out of balsamic vinegar, so I used raspberry balsamic vinegar instead.It gave it a great sweet tangy taste. It made all the other spices just pop. My family loved it and I will make it again.

I made a couple small changes to the original recipe.  I omitted the chili powder and used 5 cloves of fresh crushed garlic.  Served it as an alternative meat dish for our Christmas dinner and got rave reviews.

Awesome marinade! I actually used a balsamic and olive oil vinagrette and then let it sit in a glass pan for about an hour and then slow cooked it in the frying pan on a low heat. The balsamic wiht the spices=perfection!

Love this flavor! I used thighs, skinned, and a good quality balsamic vinegar. Left out the chili powder, and I was heavier on the spices. Marinated about 3 hours and grilled 30 minutes total.  Thanks!

Made this tonight. Followed recipe exactly. I agree you may not taste all the spices but the blend coupled with the balsmic vinegar was fantastic. Cooked at 400 for an internal temp of 172 (about 30 minutes) and then let rest for 10 minutes. It was so moist and delicious.  Husband loved!  Wouldn't recommend changing a thing.  I marinated it for about 4 hours. I used white pepper rather than black pepper.  Mixed everything in the bag and then added the chicken. Saves washing!

JUST when I wanted some of that balsalmic flavor....I found this recipe... It was very good.  the longer it marinates... the stronger the balsalmic.

Chicken was juicy, but after marinating for about 3 hours, this still didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting, nor was the flavor that great.

The chicken was tender and tasty, but dry.  I cooked it covered at 350 for 45 minutes thinking it would maintain some juices.  Used skinless breasts...maybe that was the problem?

I loved the way the flavors blended together! I honestly didn't think it was going to be as good as it was! I let it marinate for about 4 hours prior to cooking and it was juicy and super flavorful when I cooked it. Smells great too!

this was not as good as i'd anticipated.  it needed more salt/garlic.  and maybe a tiny bit of canola oil (i used skinless boneless chik breasts).   i think i would have fared better using good seasons italian dressing.  i love balsamic vinegar, and had high hopes !

This chicken recipe was great!  I marinated it overnight and it was very flavorful!  I took the suggestions of another user and added FRESH garlic, soy sauce, and brown sugar.  I will most certainly make this recipe again!

Looked horrible, but tasted delicious! I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I used fresh onions and garlic instead of dried and used poultry seasoning, because I didn't have any rosemary. I thought the chicken would be dry after cooking for 40 minutes, but because of the marinade, the chicken was tender and well-flavored.

I followed this recipe to a T,  and I was fairly disappointed. I found that the chicken was dry and the spices didn't really work that well together. I wanted to love this dish but I couldn't because my kids wrinkled thier noses and drowned the chicken in ranch. Sorry.

This was easy and I really liked it. The chicken was moist and flavorful.  I used frozen chicken breasts from Sam's Club.  I marinated them while they were still frozen and put them in the refrigerator for about an hour.  They were still frozen when I cooked them but they turned out great.

Followed the recipie exact - I found it good, but the flavour was not quite as strong as I was expecting (and would have liked) it to be. I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours before cooking. Next time I may try to marinate overnight, or make a glaze instead.   All in all it this is a good recipie which could use some minor tweaks to suit personal taste and preference.

It was very tasty but I used 1/4 tsp cayenne rather than chili powder and red pepper flakes. I also used more garlic than called for in the recipe since we love garlic so much.

This recipe was soooo easy and delicious. I skipped the dried minced onion and upped the garlic a tinch and they turned out perfect. I am going to marinade a double batch tonight and try the same recipe out on grill for a BBQ gathering tomorrow and hoping for the same results!

the chicken was moist..but all I could taste was the balsamic vinegar and it was way too much for my husband and I....and that is after only marinating it for about an hour and a half. Not the recipe for us, but for those that love vinegar it may be fine

The chicken flavor was good, but it was too dry in my opinion.  I would bake it in more liquid next time.

I used chicken pieces (too much for my chicken soup)and marinated it all day - 9 to 5. I just lined up all the spices on the counter so that made it quicker. Final result was a bit too much pepper (my fault) and the balsamic vinegar too strong. I would try the recipe again but cut back on those 2 ingredients. Oh! Cook in the marinade too for use on rice.

I followed the directions exactly but unfortunately at about 33 minutes the surrounding sauce started to heavily burn so I had to take it out immediately. The chicken came out ok, pretty dry, but at least unburned. The taste is OK, not horrible, but could be better. It would be nice to incorporate a complimentary sauce of sorts to pour over the chicken after so it's not so dry.

Made chicken as written except I cut the cooking time to 30 mins due to the size of my breast halves and the chicken was so moist and flavorful.  Just a hint of the balsamic and the rosemary was jumpin off with flavor.  Thanks for a delicious and simple way to eat chicken breasts.  Also very healthy main dish.

Really good recipe -- I didn't have all the spices, but still turned out excellent.  Even with the chili pepper and pepper flakes it wasn't too spicy.  I meant to bake it in the oven, and then my husband got home right as I threw them in, and he grabbed them and threw them on the bbq grill -- oh so yum!!!!  Served with rice and veggies.

Very delicious!  I marinated overnight and this chicken has tons of flavor.  Only thing--cook time is too long for the chicken breasts we have.  They are the Costco Kirkland brand and are very thin.  I can see the cook time working if you have thicker or bone in chicken breasts, but I cooked mine 30, not 40 min, and they were still a bit dry.  I should've done less, but I guess I'm not used to baking at that temp.  Otherwise, very very nice.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I listened to some other reviewers and added soy sauce to the marinade and bread crumbs before baking.  Also didn't have all the spices, so I just mixed and matched.  Bread crumbs worked out great--it was tender and juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. Marinaded for about 2.5 hours in the fridge.

Ok, I am going to do the thing that drives me crazy when others do this, but this was too strong of just a balsamic taste (I know, I know, it IS called BALSAMIC marinated chicken). I think it would have had the exact same taste if I omitted all the rest of the ingredients. If I try again, I might double everything but the balsamic. Not bad, just not what I was expecting.

I assume I didn't marinate this long enough to get the fantastic results that everyone else got... I did for 2-3 hours, at most, and then baked it.  The flavor was barely there and the chicken seemed drier than I am used to having when I bake my chicken breasts in marinara sauce.  I did bake several at once and kept them for meals during the week, so maybe that was part of the problem.  I'm not going to write off the recipe, yet, and may try it again, but my results were just sub-par.

I used this marinate on chicken thighs - it was very good.  I boiled the thighs in sea salt and water.  Placed in a plastic and poured the marinate over the chicken while it was hot - absortion of marinate was great.
Very tasty !!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't actually taste this.  However, my family loved it and says that it was wonderful!  The only thing I changed was that I broiled the chicken rather than baked it.  I served it with rice and salad; and there were smiles all around.

Not sure why everyone is raving about this one--cooked for 30 minutes and despite adding olive oil to the marinade, it was dry and sweetened by the balsamic--not even the fresh crushed rosemary could be discerned from the myriad other ingredients.  I'm not sure what would fix it.  Oh well, you can't love all of them!

This was pretty good.  Used boneless chicken breasts.  Subbed dried ingredients for fresh b/c I had them on hand (parsley, rosemary, garlic and onion).  Otherwise followed recipe.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really good.  I doubled the recipe for 11 chicken breasts, used onion powder instead of minced onion, doubled the amount of garlic (of course) and 1/2 dried, 1/2 fresh rosemary.  I let this soak for about 12 hours, microwaved in the marinade for about 10 minutes and finished up on the grill.  Everyone LOVED it.  I think this one is going into my file of "Really Good Stuff to do With Chicken Breasts."

We were not crazy about this.  Much prefer Balsamic Braised Chicken.

When I told my husband I was going to make baked chicken for dinner he wasn't excited.  He said that baked chicken is always dry no matter how you do it.  He and our guest loved it and it wasn't dry at all.  The flavor was great.  I did used skinless chicken breast on the bone I doubled the spices and add 1/4 c. more vinegar.  Great recipe!!!
