I'm not much of a stir fry fan, but this recipe is great, the best stir fry I've ever had.  I used pureed pineapple instead of chunks, which spread the flavor well.

I made this with shrimp.  It was pretty good.  very flavorful.  I needed to use up some veggies and added mushrooms, onions, snow peas and garlic.  Everything worked.  I also subbed half chili sauce for ketchup -- didn't want it to be too sweet.  To keep the sauce thick, I used some arrowroot...worked like a charm.  I'd make this again...

Worth the five stars.  I used thinly sliced carrots instead of snow peas.  Served it with basmati rice.

Very good & very easy. I followed the recipe to a tea and it was a little too sweet, so I'd tone down the sugar a bit. We like spicy food here, so I added a bit more chili pepper. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this with regular frozen peas instead of snow peas and left out the green onions (my husband hates them) and it was absolutely scrumptious!  So quick too!

My husband and I must use this recipe at least once every two weeks. It's quick, easy and makes great leftovers. It seems we serve it every time we have guests. I recommend making the sauce first and setting it aside, that was the heat has time to get around. In addition make sure to cook the pineapple for a few minutes at the end, otherwise it'll still be cold.  We tried a twist on this recipe for the summer months - grilled the ingredients as you would a shish-kabob, using the sauce as a basting liquid, and making the rice inside. I recommend having a little additional sauce for topping off the plate, but the added grill flavor was a great addition.

This was a very tasty and easy family meal.  I used Chili Garlic Sauce instead of Chili powder and it gave it a nice kick.
