There is a LOT of ingredients and a LOT of steps. The recipe is okay but doesn't have the WOW factor it should for all of the money, time, and effort that goes into it. Sorry. On the positive note, the meat is very tender if you let it marinate 24 hours.

I made some changes, so take this with a grain of salt. 

For the marinade, I used 1/2 tsp worcestire + 1/2 tsp dried thyme + 1 tsp salt and no pepper. 

For the squash, I mixed the egg with the flour before tossing with the squash. My instincts told me this would work out better, though not sure if it really made a difference or not. 

I pan fried the steak with the veggies. That was a bad plan. I should have pan fried the steak separate and added it to the veggie mixture at the end, like the recipe states. The veggies/beef gave off a ton of liquid. I drained off the liquid before adding the broth. I used 1/2 tsp worcestire and 1/4 tsp dried thyme in the broth. I still needed to use 2 T of flour to get it to thicken up. 

I used two casserole dishes as it looked as if it may have been too much meat/veggies for one. 

I used a mix of Swiss and pepper jack, and probably doubled the amount called for. 

It was good. I especially liked the squash; I may start making squash this way from now on. The steak and sauce were good, but not great. I think a few tweaks could take it to great, though.
