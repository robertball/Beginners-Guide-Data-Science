This was an ok shake.  I'm not entirely sure that I'd make it again but if I did, I'd peel the pears.  As my roommate said, "The shake was kind of skinny," meaning that you could feel the texture of the pear skins and some of the very very thin skin from the orange.

I halved the recipe and only barely filled a fairly small glass.  It was tasty-- orange-vanilla-y goodness, but the pear was hidden.  I blended it extra-long to make sure all the fruit skins were pureed completely.  I would probably make this again, but leave the pear to be enjoyed separately.

Added a couple of ingredients: 1/8 teaspoon of vanilla extract (to replace the flavor of the ice cream) and instead of "ice cream" i used Soy Milk.   This smoothie is my hubby's favorite!

Didn't have all ingredients on hand so improvised..it was more like a smoothie versus a shake.  Did not have oranges, or vanilla ice cream.
Crushed 8 ice cubes, added OJ vs oranges, added 3/4 cup plain yogurt & vanilla vs ice cream.  I omitted the skins from the pears as some suggested and added 2 med frozen bananas for thickness.  I liked the taste.  Will try with ice cream or frozen vanilla yogurt next time.
