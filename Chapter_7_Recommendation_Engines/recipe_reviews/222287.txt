Excellent!!  I thought i might not like the combination of the cottage cheese and cheddar but, I did. The only thing I did different was grill them instead of baking but, they turned out great. Even the 3 1/2 year old gave me the thumbs up!

I only used this recipe as inspiration because other mushroom burger recipes required grilling (I have a tiny kitchen and no grill). But I kind of mixed recipe ideas, stuffing my two 'shrooms with 2 roma tomatoes, a heavy fistful of spinach, what is probably an unhealthy-but-yummy handful of shredded parmesan, basil paste (or fresh if you have it), 2 cloves minced garlic, 2-3 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar, S&P to taste, onion powder, a stalk of green onion, and bread crumbs. We criss-crossed the top with cut strips of roasted red peppers (the soft kind from the jar), and then baked it as instructed above. While it cooled after 12 minutes, we melted two slices of provolone cheese per mushroom on top, and then ate it on wheat bread instead of buns. But if you have proper burger buns, definitely opt for that. Basically my roommate and I had a field day with stuff we had in our kitchen already. It was definitely overstuffed and required either bad table manners or a fork and knife to eat, but SO, SO, SO good!
I do plan on trying this exact recipe sometime.

Good for a change and easy. I think it could use something else- maybe sprinkle some soy sauce on the mushroom?

The whole family adored this recipe.  I did add significantly more garlic like a whole minced head plus dried minced garlic, a saut√©ed onion, seasoned bread crumbs, and more salt.  I will make this again very soon

Great recipe.  Portobellos are so versitile and flavourful. I did make a couple of additions though. I first cooked some bacon I had cut into small chunks. I then sauted some fresh garlic in some of the reserved bacon drippings. Then I added the spinach and cooked all of it together. After that mixture cooled I then added the rest of the ingredients and followed the rest of the recipe. The cooking time is a bit off though as I had to cook for at least 20 minutes not 12. Other than that this was awesome. A little mayo, sauted onion, tomato, and a toasted bun and this is a keeper.

Holy cow (no pun intended), these taste like a straight-up hamburger. They're really good. Even my wife liked them. I doubled up on the filling since my caps were humongous, and that was a good thing. They're moist and meaty-feeling.

Very tasty and nice enough to cook it again. I added some sweet red bell pepper, and onion to the spinach mixture and rather than microwave the spinach, I cut it up before hand and sauteed the above ingredients together. Instead of using cottage cheese I had some ricotta cheese on hand and used that instead.  I also made my own homemade hamburger rolls.

Keep things drained before putting it in/on the big meaty Portobello. I strained the cottage cheese, leaving curds. I cooked spinach in a little butter w/ a lot of garlic...then squeezed/squashed it. The Shroom will give up some juice, but the whole thing isn't soggy this way. Darn good mushroom flavor. Diced onions etc might fit on top of the thing as well. I didn't scoop out all the gills...I like them too.

I used provolone cheese instead of the cheddar/cottage blend since I had neither of those. I also used fresh spinach that I added a little water to to cook, but otherwise I kept to the recipe exactly. These were delicious!

I used fresh spinach and just gave it a rough chop without microwaving. I also used 2% cottage cheese and added a little more than 1/4 cup. I added granulated garlic, granulated onions and pepper. No salt because I used Sheep cheddar which is already very salty. I used 1/4 cup and added a little on top. Turned out great. Yum!

So good!
I didn't change anything other than adding a little bit more cottage cheese and shredded cheese. Didn't put anything on the buns either.
Pretty tasty!

Great meal!  I added a slice of tomato covered by mozzarella to a couple of them.  It was a hit with or without the tomato and mozzarella.

I substituted parmesan for the cheddar.   My wife liked it a lot.   Next time I'll add more garlic.

This was wonderful!  I added fresh garlic, diced onion and a little dried thyme.  I mixed seasoned bread crumbs, grated Parmesan and olive oil for a topping and then cooked as directed.  We ate without buns.  My family loved this recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I agree with another writer, it feels like the sandwich is missing something...I'll have to try the soy sauce idea.

Very good.  We liked them better without a bun though.
