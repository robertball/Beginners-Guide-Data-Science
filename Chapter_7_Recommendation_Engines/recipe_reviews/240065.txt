Although this dish tasted good, I can only give it three stars because, frankly, it looked disgusting.  It looked exactly like super watery, mushy scrambled eggs. Normally I'm not fussy when it comes to food appearance, but this time it actually interfered with my ability to enjoy the meal.

I LOVE spaghetti squash, and found this recipe to be a very delightful NEW way to enjoy it. I used 2 shallots in place of the leeks, and chives instead of the parsley , everything else remained the same. Love how rich this tasted, without the added carbs.  Will try with pancetta next time!

Fine flavor, but  it made me miss pasta. It also was quite unappetizing to look at.

Overall I enjoyed the dish. I'll probably use one less egg next time, it felt a little overly egg-y to me and not quite creamy enough. Maybe a dash of cream? Small changes could make this a 5 star dish, and I'll certainly make it again.

Delicious! I was looking for a new way to prepare the spaghetti squash coming out of the garden, and this was the ticket. I didn't have quite enough cheese but it was still good. De-glazing the pan with white wine adds a little something special- don't skip this step! I garnished with chopped fresh tomato and basil, also from the garden. A simple, tasty dish. Thank you for sharing!

I made this with just leaving out bacon, etc.  I scrambled the eggs, added white wine, garlic, etc...I would also add spinach, chopped broccoli, or some veggie...even some plain, non fat yogurt.  I put the spaghetti squash after getting out of shell into a quiche pan and the rest on top....I made ahead and then a stuck in microwave a couple min..

I didn't have leeks and used red onion instead. I added a small amount of roasted chicken to the carbonara

Super easy and great result.  I added some sliced mushrooms per another reviewer and cooked them with the garlic and onion. I added some green onions for color as I did not have much parsley.  I would suggest lots of fresh ground pepper and maybe a dash of hot sauce or chili flakes.

This came up in a "Vegetarian" search. Bacon is not even a favor we want. Pass...no interest in this recipe for our family.

This was delicious. I added mushrooms to the mix. It was wonderful, my two year old even loved it. I can't think of anything else I changed.
