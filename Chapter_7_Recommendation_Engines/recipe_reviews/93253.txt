This was fairly fast and pretty good, but too salty! I used iodized sea salt, so not sure if that made a difference.

I don't use fresh tomatoes in the winter because they are poor in flavor, so I used 2 cans of organic canned tomatoes. I also took the advice of New Cook and used 1 tsp. of salt. I like spice so I used 2 jalapenos, may add more next time. I used a processor on pulse. I didn't roast because I like fresh onions and peppers. Makes it seem closer to fresh when using canned tomatoes. On the whole, MUCH better than 'store-bought'!
