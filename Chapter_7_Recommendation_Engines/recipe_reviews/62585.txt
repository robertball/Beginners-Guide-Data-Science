alright...so these were ok as written.  my daughter and i made them this morning to try because they were quick.  everybody ate the original recipe but we didnt' enjoy it very much because they were super dry and didn't have much flavor.  so, i tryed again with a few changes.  first, i used all flour instead of cornstarch, then instead of powdered milk i used 1/3 cup of regular from the bottle milk, and lastly i added 1 tsp of vanilla, i think almond would work too. we split them up into more cookies splitting that dough into 12 make awfully large cookies. and the final result of the experimental cookies was that they were still kind of dry but they had a better texture and better flavor.  (also we sifted powdered sugar on top of both batches of cookies, which helped both  :D)   we will make these again

I just made these a few minutes ago and am eating a warm one right now. Very tasty, delicate little short bread. I will save this and make it again, but I gave 4 stars because I made some adjustments. First, I couldn't get my dough to come together, so I had to add a little water, probably 1-2TB (maybe I used too small of an egg?). To the melted butter, I cooled it, then beat in the egg and added about 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Lastly, after baking them, I sprinkled them with powdered sugar. Overall I enjoy the texture - not as crumbly as I expected from a shortbread, especially considering how crumbly they were going into the oven; also they are a little chewy! Very good, simple cookie. Thank you for posting it!

These were a lot like the whipped shortbread that I usually make. Yes, they are dry. So was my old recipe. I do add 1 tsp of almond and dust with powdered sugar. We all love them.

It's one of the best sugar cookies I've ever baked so far. It's simple, easy to make, less greasy and tasty. In every recipe, you're free to make some adjustments based on your preferences. To sum it up, it's so nutritious and delicious...

What a waste!  Followed the recipe as written, against my gut instinct (seemed like it would be dry).  Got a bowl full of crumbs that would not come together to make a dough.  Ended up adding another 1/4 cup of soft butter to get it to bind.  Cookies ended up bland, floury, and dry.

This brings me back to my childhood, buying a pack of puto seco from the sarisari store.  The ones I bought then had these cookies in little packets, shaped like little sampaguita (jasmine) flowers which I intend to do with this recipe. 

To those commenting that it is too dry, this cookie is really meant to be on the dry side, like polvoron if you have tasted one. 

This is a crumbly kind of cookie; not a cake.

The one comment I have on this recipe is that you dont sift the egg togther with the dry ingrdients. Sift all dry indridients first, then the egg, then a trickle of water or vanilla essence to help bind the mixture. Useda bit more extra sugar

I did what a previous reviewer said and I used regular milk instead of milk powder and added vanilla extract then sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar after taking them out the oven. Texture is great but it tastes a little bland.
