I made the corned beef (using Guinness) exactly as written and cooked it for 6 hours on the stove top. I then removed the meat (which fell apart) and added 3 pounds quartered new potatoes, 2 pounds baby carrots (cut in half) and an onion. I let that cook for 20 minutes and then added a head of cabbage. I cooked an additional 15 minutes. Then I removed the veggies and made a gravy out of the leftover stock using a slurry of stock and corn starch. This recipe was a huge hit last night for our St. Patrick's Day get together. Very authentic tasting and the peppercorns get soft as they cook, so when you bite into one, you get a nice kick without being overly powerful or chipping your teeth. This will be our annual tradition!

Wish there were more than 5 stars because this recipe deserves a 10.  Wife was in the hospital and I was fending for myself when I tried this.  Put 2 briskets in the crockpot and headed off to work.  Stopped at the deli and got some cole slaw and Swiss cheese on the way home from work, and ended up wishing I had cooked twice as much.  Took a couple of BIG sandwiches to work the next day, and my coworkers forced me to share once they got a whiff.  Kept asking the name of the deli where I bought it, and couldn't believe I made it myself.  Well, here are your 10 stars from me and my office * * * * * * * * * *

This was so easy and delicious!  I used both spice packets that came with the briskets and put everything into a slow cooker set on low for 10 hours.  The liquid remains red because of the nature of corned beef -- this does not mean it's not cooked.  It is done when it is fork-tender.  I also poured the leftover cooking liquid into a pot on the stovetop and boiled cabbage in it; it gave the cabbage really good flavor.

Wowee!  Very very good.  I threw everything in the crockpot before work, when I came home we had an awesome meal.  I'm thinking I'll never just boil another slab of corned beef in water again.

Was happily surprised by this recipe!  It was very easy to perpare when you pop it all in the crock pot and just let it go all day.  We ended up cooking it about 10 hours, and it was so tender, easy to shred for sandwiches.  Not extremely salty, the way I usually think brisket tastes.  We toasted the rolls, added swiss cheese and home made thousand island dressing from this site--Delicious! Will definitely be going to this one a lot through the colder months especially.  Glad we did 2 briskets, cause one certainly would not have been enough.  Thanks!

I've made this twice now and followed the recipe to a "T".

This is one of the few things in life that I want to continue to eat long after I'm full.  It is THAT good!

We'll never have "plain ol'" corned beef in our house again.

Thriftynin--I'm not sure why you reviewed my recipe when you didn't make my recipe!  Leaving out the beer and peppercorns is eliminating a great deal of flavor, so I'm not surprised that you said it was lacking in flavor.  If you're worried about the alcohol, it cooks off and leaves behind the hops, yeast, etc. that give beer its flavor and these are imparted into the meat.

Prepared it in the morning before work.  Took about 3 minutes to throw everything in and turn it on.  When I got home that night, I realized I didn't have any bread, so we used tortillas instead.  Wrapped in tortillas tasted delicious.  Used the remaining liquid to boil some cabbage and carrots over the stove.  That took an additional 30 minutes.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This is the same recipe I have used for years BUT after cooking I put it the refrigerator overnight. Just before serving I slice it (and it slices perfectly) and place it in a 13x9pan and cover it with one or two cups of the reserved cooking liquid for 30 minutes.This just warms it and it tastes just like the best New York deli meat.

Wonderful recipe. My only suggestion is to let the brisket cool completely before slicing. The cooler it is, the more it will slice nicely instead of shred. I usually cook it overnight, then scrape the fat off in the morning, roll in foil to keep it moist, and put it in the fridge. Then, in the evening, you can slice it super thin. Also, strain and save the broth to cook cabbage, potatoes, and carrots. To die for!!!

I won't give this anything less than 5 stars because it was really tasty.  I cooked it in a slow cooker for 9 hours total.  I will definitely go the slow cooker way from now on.  It was much better. It fell apart and was really juicy.  I took the beef out of the liquid and put it in a foil covered bowl, then poured the liquid into a large pot.  I cooked red potatoes, baby carrots & half of a red onion for 15 mins in the liquid, then added a small head of cabbage (cut into wedges) for another 15.  After I drained the veggies, I tossed them with a bunch of fresh parsley and 2 T butter.  But there's a bad: I've made corned beef without beer quite a few times and this time I decided to try it with a couple Guinness.  What could be more flavorful than Guinness Stout?  Well, I can tell you that it tasted nearly the same as when I make it with just water and the same seasoning.  I couldn't tell I used beer.  Next time I'll drink the Guinness on it's own and just use water.

This is by far the best method of making corned beef I have ever used. I highly reccomend using the liquid left over to boil potatoes, onions, carrots and cabbage one the meat is removed. 

If you use a stout such as guiness you can make a very unique and delicious gravy from some of the kiquid one the veggies are removed. I actually put some of the liquid in a blender and toss in some carrots, onions, a few of the garlic cloves and some potato, then blend it into a slurry. Then just pour it into a sauce pan add some cornstarch/water mix and bring it to a boil. It really comes out quite phenomanal and is nothing anyone at your dinner table will have tried before.

Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Made this for my Irish mother who loves corned beef more than any other meat.  She was more than a little worried about the amount of garlic and peppercorns.  Her worries were totally unfounded, I didn't change a thing and she is still raving about it.

I took the advice of the most helpful reviewer (naples34102) and did mine in the crockpot on low. Ten hours later and I had the best corned beef I have ever had. I was so impressed that I rushed out the very next day and purchased two more briskets so that we could have it again soon. The beer smell is pretty strong in the first couple of hours but it eventually goes away so don't let it scare you off. No need to change a thing with this recipe.

Very easy and tasty. I was a little worried about "boiling" meat but, it was awesome. We had no left overs which is what I wanted so I could make sandwiches. Definately a keeper.

5 stars aren't enough for this recipe.  Friends who own a DELI came to visit and fell in love with this recipe.  John asked for the recipe because he's going to try serving it at his shop.

I am NOT a corned beef person, but this recipe changed my opinion!  I went from tasting corned beef maybe once a year on St. Patrick's Day to making this recipe once a month.  I layer it with the "cola sauerkraut" recipe,(also on this website), a slice of swiss, and some Thousand Island dressing on some deli rye.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Can't say enough great things about this recipe....you really have to try it to believe it!

Are you kidding. Throw out all the other recipes for corned beef. This makes killer sandwiches. You dont need to drive to Canters in LA or any other place  that claims to sell the " BEST " . This is the best. Don't go any farther. Scooter Steve Utah Why is there not 6 stars?

This is an exceptional recipe that offers everything you might want: ease of preparation and incredible outcome.  I've used this recipe exclusively for nearly 3 years now but never bothered to rate it until I pulled it up today to print for yet ANOTHER coworker who requested my "fabulous corned beef recipe".  It really irked me to see the one star review by Jessica complaining about a lack of seasoning because this recipe (and corned beef in general) is all about loads of seasoning and flavor!  Did she use a plaing brisket instead of corned beef?  She said she never made corned beef before and I wonder if she knew what to buy.  I strongly urge her to try the recipe again and follow the directions exactly and she will have a meltingly tender piece of meat to be proud of.  If there werre more stars available I would scored this much higher than just 5.

I halved the recipe and used the crock-pot on low for 12 hours. The meat was so juicy and flavorful, fall apart tender...so amazing that my husband said to run to the store and buy more corned beef while it is on sale. I don't think we'll ever eat corned beef any other way...and it was so easy. Made great sandwiches.

The reviews saying it's better to make this on the stove top rather than in a slow cooker are wrong. I make this every year for St. Paddy's day, and every year my invite list gets longer and longer because more people want this corned beef. One year I made two briskets side by side, one on the stove top and one in the slow cooker. Every guest said the slow cooker brisket turned out much, much better. It fell apart, and tasted amazing. I follow this recipe to a "T," let it cook on low for at least 8 hours, and feed a dozen or so hungry friends. I use the left over liquid to quickly cook some cabbage on the stove top - and people tell me it's the best cabbage they've ever had. This recipe is hands-down a winner. I shared it with my mom and now it's the only one she uses. Thank you so much for sharing!!!!!

I've made this several times, not a "seasonal" thing. It is OUTSTANDING. I have made it with different kinds of beer, dark, light (not lite) it is always great. Don't change anything, just follow the recipe. Makes killer sammies with home made Thousand Island dressing, Swiss cheese, kraut, good dark rye bread. 
DANG! I may go get a corned beef flat right now!!!

So delicious! I will never make corned beef any other way. So ridiculously easy too. I had about 5 minutes to spare before work and I was somehow able to get this in the crockpot with everything and I still wasn't late for work. This doesn't have to be for sandwiches only, I plan on using the leftovers for Reuben Soup (also on Allrecipes.com)

I made this recipe following the directions as given, adding a 2 large sliced onions along with the garlic cloves.  I placed the spice packet contents into a square of cheese cloth, along with the quarter cup + of peppercorns and the bayleaves to form a garnet.  I cooked the corn beef (on the stove)using Guiness, until it pierced easily with a fork (I found cooking it longer, made it fall apart about 2 to 2 1/2 hours) and we like it sliced rathered than pulled.  After the meat was removed, I added potatoes, carrots and cooked til tender.  Once the meat was cooled, I sliced thinly with an electric knife.  What was left, I stored in the refrigerator and made Reuben's using rye bread, Thousand Island Dressing, and Claussen's sauerkraut with slices of Swiss cheese.  Then grilled the sandwiches until bread was nice and toasty brown!  Two meals in one and then some! Awesome! Definitely will make again and again!

I prepared this for a festive St. Paddy's Day gathering last night, and not a speck left on the platter, and rave reviews!  I prepared in the slow cooker, first two hours on high, last 6 or so on low.  I added about 2 1/2 bottles of Harp, and added tiny potatos, carrots and cabbage right into the mix.  Perfect!  Sincere thanks, I'll be making this many more times.

Agree with previous reviews that 5 stars aren't enough.  Was leery about all that garlic, but decided to follow recipe exactly and then make modifications in the future if it was "close".  Well, it hit the bullseye!!  Family raved, and I'm making a double batch for our St. Paddy's get-together.

5-star rating - for sure! I made this for our St. Patrick's meal, and we loved it.  I made with 1 corn beef brisket and added potatoes and cabbage.  The manager of the local liquor store helped me pick a beer (as I am NOT a beer drinker).  He said the local chefs used 'Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale' to cook their briskets.  I purchased 1 bottle and the flavor of the beer did not ruin the corn beef.  You could slightly taste it, but it was not offensive in this recipe.  This recipe was so good that I went back after the 17th and purchased another brisket to have this recipe again.  Thanks SDK999 for sharing your recipe.

I will agree that this is a tasty recipe.  I followed the given recipe and everyone loved it.  The reason I am rating this with only 3 stars is because of the taste of the leftovers.  The garlic flavor was so much stronger that it was unappealing.  The texture of the meat was not appetizing.  I always make more than I expect to serve for dinner because the leftovers make such delicious sandwiches.  Such is not the case with this particular recipe.

This recipe is awesome! Had it tonight for dinner and my BF loved it! The only thing I change is this: take about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and rub it onto the brisket before putting it into the beer/water. This helps infuse a deep, rustic, rich flavor to the meat. It doesn't make it sweet. Cooked it in my slow cooker on low for 8 hours, took it out and popped my potatoes, carrots, and cabbage in for about an hour/hour and a half. SO GOOD!

Delicious!  I used 2 bottles of Guiness beer and beef broth instead of water to cover the brisket.  It was perfect in exactly 3 hours.  While the meat was setting, I used the stock to boil some Yukon gold potatoes, fresh kale and golden beets.  I also made the "Irresistible Irish Soda Bread" and served that with the dinner.  Absolutly perfect St. Patrick's Day meal!  Don't forget extra Guiness to drink with dinner.  I am freezing the remaining stock because the beer and garlic flavor was fantastic.

My hubby has awarded this the BEST corned beef sandwich EVER and he has tried corned beef all over town!  What started as a trip to our local deli for a corned beef sandwich and found that they were closed turned into a trip to the grocery store and to this site.  I am a newbie to corned beef and had NO idea where to start.  This recipe was easy and the best!  My hubby thinks I slaved in the kitchen all day preparing this.....I am not sure I will tell him otherwise :)

ive never really been a big fan on corn beef, ran across this recipe, read the reviews, then decided to give a try. i did not use the bay leaves or peppercorn, but i placed in slowcooker for about 10 hours. used 24 ounze heiniken, i must say all day i was afraid that the beer was way tooo much but when i first tried it i couldnt tell if i liked it, i kept picking like hmm hmmm, so the next day i made sandwiches used cornbeef,provolone, topped with just enough thousand islands sauce. it was outta this world. now im going to be making every couple of months, thank you soo much for sharing :)

This was excellent - I only had one corned beef, so I halved the recipe. The flavors were great - we only had enough meat left over for 1 sandwich the next day - I will definitely use 2 corned beefs next time!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I omit the water and put in a slow cooker for around 9 hours on low.  Melts in your mouth. Perfect for corned beef sammies on rye.

This is the BEST Corned Beef recipe! Made as instructed and had the moistest, tenderest and flavorful corned beef. Stove top by far is better than a slowcooker for this cut of meat and the addition of garlic was brilliant, it added even more awesome flavor. Use a brand of beer you like, it doesn't matter light or dark just as long as you like it. Don't worry about trimming the corned beef either because after you cook it you can simply scrap away the excess fat without any effort at all.

This recipe is easy and the results are wonderful.  I brought these sandwiches to a party and they were gone in no time at all.  I considering putting 1000 island dressing or mustard on the sandwiches, but after tasting the meat I decided against it.  The corn beef was so tasty that any condiment would just have distracted from the great taste of the corned beef.

Very Good! I used a 2lb corn beef, one spice packet, an entire 16 oz of beer (my husband got carried away)cooked for 3.5 hours. Was delicious and flavorful. I thought my husband had ruined it using all that beer but he didn't. Just a note: Neither of us like or drink beer.

PERFECT!!! I just LOVE this recipe and so does my husband. I cook this all day on low in the crockpot and it comes out perfectly each and every time. This last time, I put it in the crockpot before bed and 10 hours later it was beautiful! I wouldn't change a thing. The seasoning is great and so is the beer. Thank you for this recipe post. This is my fifth time cooking corned beef this way, and I have no desire to make it any other way. It is absolutely wonderful alone or on sandwiches and my husband just RAVES everytime I prepare this. Try it with some sweet coleslaw on sandwiches or alone served with fried cabbage!! Job well done, SDK999.

I made this yesterday for St. Patty's Day. I was a little nervous because I had never cooked corned beef before and I wanted to serve my family Reuben sandwiches. I followed the recipe to the tee and let me tell you it did not let me down. I cooked 2(3)lbs corned beef briskets and I am proud to say there is absolutely NO left overs. This recipe is definitely a 10 in my book. DH asked me stop by the Grocer today to pick up another corned beef while they are still on sale. Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe

I threw everything in a slow cooker and cooked on low for 6 hours, then high for 2 hours. I did both packets of spices (not just 1) and served it on garlic toasted bread with the juices in a dipping bowl on the side. It was absolutely amazing! I'll definitely be making this again!

Delicious & simple! My first attempt at corned beef & I'm glad I chose this recipe, tho' I did use the crockpot (1st hour on high). I used Guiness Extra Stout; it was worth the $1.50 for a bottle, as it added a distinct flavor. Halving the spice packet is a good idea if eating the beef fresh & warm. I used a whole pkt. for ONE 3 lb. point-cut; the taste of it & 1/2 bulb (smashed) garlic cloves was a little too strong while steaming hot. The next day, tho', the flavor had mellowed & was perfect. It was also VERY easy to slice thinly after refrigeration. I cooked the wedges of cabbage, onion, potato quarters, & carrot chunks in the flavorful liquid the last 2 hours. I also thickened slightly about 3 c. of cooking liquid with a slurry of about 2+ Tblsp. of cornstarch stirred with 2 Tbsp. water - delicious! No need to waste that flavorful liquid!

So easy and delicious!  Even my little ones wanted more since it isn't as salty as store-bought corned beef.  This one will be stored in my home cookbook where only the best recipes go!!

I love corned beef but my family just thinks it's so-so.  This recipes finally got us all on the same page!!!  I did everything exactly as written and it was fantastic.  We had the sandwiches this weekend and my kids were still asking for more on MOnday.  Next time I am going to make 3 briskets.

My picky family (and I) just loved this.  Made it on game day and the 3 briskets just disappeared.  Thank you!

Best corned beef ever! Use all the ingredients as noted and just put in a crock pot on low for 10 hours - perfect every time!

I rarely make corned beef because they usually turn out tough or stringy, but a local store had brisket on sale for 50% off, so I decided to try one more time to cook one. After making this recipe, I sent my husband to buy 3-4 more before the sale ends! The meat was tender and delicious! I used a bottle of Guinness Extra Stout and poured the spice pack into a cheesecloth bag and added them to the crock pot with the brisket. I also roasted the whole bulb of garlic in the oven for approximately 30 mins before adding it to the crock pot and cooking it all for about 10 hours on Low. We loved the meat on ruebens last night and I'm sure we will love the hash I make with the leftover brisket in the morning! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe and restoring my faith in brisket made at home!

This has been my tried and true recipe for several years and I made the mistake of trying the Braised Corned Beef Recipe for our family meal.  BIG MISTAKE!  I intend to quit experimenting and use this recipe from now on.  I have never had it turn out tough or tasteless like the baked version did, and my family was in rebellion.  I am just glad I bought extra corned beef while it was on sale and we were able to have the good stuff (this recipe) and I redeemed myself for the family.  This recipe needs absolutely NO CHANGES!  It comes out perfect every time whether I make it just for sandwiches or use the broth to cook the vegetables and have a full corned beef dinner.  Thank you thank you thank you!

I've been making this recipe for years..... it's absolutely the best and easiest way to make corned beef.
My only comment... use a full bodied beer, not lite. You want the beer flavor. Guinness is great, but any medium to dark beer will work.  

I always double the recipe, it goes really fast and I want some leftovers!

WOW!  That's all I can say about this recipe.  Super simple, and it is the BEST corned beef recipe hands down.  Followed the directions exactly, except I used about 6-8 cloves of garlic and not the whole bulb.  There is no other recipe I will use on St. Patrick's Day ever again!

Made this yesterday and it was sooo good. Couldn't fit both briskets in my crock pot, so I did one on the stove on medium-low (closer to low) heat for approx. 5 1/2 hours, the other in the crock for about 10 hours. Used Guinness beer, a little water and some beef broth, 2 bay leaves in each, white and black peppercorns, divided a spice packet between them and a bulb and 1/2 of garlic, evenly divided. I did press a few of the cloves. I had never cooked corned beef before so I was a bit nervous, as we were taking this to a gathering of friends....well they both turned out great, tender and so tasty. The one from the crock pot was a little more tender, but just barely. Then added quite a bit of the cooking juices to a pot of veggies (red potatoes, parsnips, turnips, baby carrots) along with some water.....later used the juices with chicken broth and butter for the cabbage. It was a great success....simple Irish soda bread with Kerrygold Irish butter completed it beautifully.

This was the best corned beef I have ever had! So tender. I cooked a 1.5 pound brisket in my 2qt crockpot for 10 hours on low. The last 30 mins I added cabbage. I used Ultra Light beer since that is what I had on hand, and the flavor was to die for. I made this with the Easy Irish Soda Bread and it was a big hit!

I love this recipe.  Where I live, I have never seen a corned beef brisket with a spice packet.  I can't fit two corned beef briskets in my crockpot so I make one at a time, as written, without the spice packet and with four cloves of garlic rather than a whole bulb.  I just let the brisket cook the whole day on low, and the results are spectacular!  I probably make this once a month.  I make reubens out of it the first day, then make corned beef hash out of the leftovers.  Can't say enough about how much we enjoy this! Thanks a bunch!

This recipe is abolutely amazin. I left out the bay leaves (didn't have them) used a whole head of garlic and a small handfull of peppercorns along with the 2 bottles of Guiness and put all of this in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours. It was just falling apart it was so tender and the taste was just amazing! I can't believe I used to just boil corned beef in water. I then took all the juices left in the slow cooker and put it into a pot on the stove and added the carrots and the potatoes and cabbage to it. I also had to add two cans of chicken broth (didn't have beef broth) to make more liquid to cover the veggies. They came out so flavorful they didn't even need butter on them! Honest!! I will definately make this again and also tell everyone I know how to make the most amazing corned beef they have ever had in their whole life!!

Since I can't rate this more than 5 stars I'll rate it here.  **********  10 stars. I made this for New Year's Day exactly as called for.  After I took out the corned beef I added carrots, red potatoes and cabbage and cooked for about an hour.  It was VERY good.  I made leftover packets for work and it was even better the next several days.  I gave some to my dad and he said he ate every speck.  Thanks for a great recipe, I'm making it again today.

I too wish we could give more than 5 stars.  This was a BIG hit at my New Year's party and I only wish I had doubled or even tripled it because it would of all disappeared. The person who said her cabbage turned out bitter might of added it at the start and caused the cabbage to cook too long.  That has happaned to me using other recipes so I don't think it's the fault of this one.  Good food is my life!!!

This is my go-to recipe for St. Paddy's Day and is always a crowd pleaser.  I highly recommend using Guinness (cans are highly preferred to bottles b/c of the widget inside that keeps it well mixed - 1 can per 3 lb. brisket), and also recommend tripling the amount of garlic per brisket - it really helps with the overall flavor.  I also cook in the crockpot for about 8 to 10 hours over low heat.  Serve with a really great rye bread (Oroweat has a really nice Dill Rye) that pairs well to bring out the flavors.  So easy to do - just make sure you buy a good quality brisket :)

This is a great recipe.  I haven't cooked corned beef in 15 years, much to my Irish husband's dismay.  You need to buy the better cut of corned beef.  I started with 4 lbs and I rinsed it off, and threw away the spice packet that came with it.  Put it in my large crockpot with a can of cheap Budweiser, a bay leaf, a heaping tablespoon of chopped garlic, and 1/4 cup of peppercorns pretty much as instructed.  Cooked on high till it started simmering, thn put on low.  Turned the meat over periodically....probably for 8 hrs or so.   Added cut up onions, carrots and potatoes.  After 45 min added some cabbage.  Ended up having to transfer to oven to complete cooking ...my fault.  Once everything was cooked, Transferred all the goodies to another dish to keep warm and followed another reviewer's recommendation and made some gravy with the juices, adding extra water and a mix of water and corn starch.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is to put the peppercorns in a couple of sections of cheesecloth.  They add great flavor but I don't like eating them. Think I'll be doing this recipe again this week for the real St. Paddy's Day!!

There is no need to change ANYTHING with this recipe!! I used bud light (because that is what we had) and threw it in the crock pot around 9 in the morning on high...by 2 o'clock we couldn't resist any longer.  I've made a LOT of briskets and this was AMAZING! Tender, mellow and simply delicious!!

This turned out awesome!  Probably the best corned beef I have ever made!  I made it using all of the ingredients listed and put it in a crockpot on low for 8 hours. I made reubens with the meat and they turned out so good!  I will be using this recipe from now on!

All I can say is: wow.  I used the slow cooker for 10 hours during a workday since I couldn't be home to watch the stove.  The flavors were excellent!  I've never made corned beef before, so I only prepared one brisket.  I used Moose Drool beer.  I don't plan on trying any other recipes- this is The One!

Easy recipe, great results. I smoke the briskit for 1 or two hours before doing this recipe in the crockpot or dutch oven over very low heat. History gives differing accounts on corned beefs beginnings, but its well known as an Irish Dish, and also most jewish deli's fix and serve this also. Who really cares....Its great food!!!!

Excellent! I've made this several times in the crock pot and also on the stove top. Garlic peeling tip: Soak separated cloves in water for about 1/2 hour and the skin peels off easily (snip the stem end off and peel down).

I tried this recipe for the first time for mother's birthday and it turned out great did make few changes I used 1 bottle of lager beer and 1 bottle of root beer my guess wanted to know what did I add to the beef beside the small pickle seasoning pack that comes with it. my mother can't wait until mother's day to get repeat, but this will become one of the family monthly dish.

OMG !!!!! This is the best tasting corned beef I have ever cooked.  I wanted something different for Christmas so I tried this recipe.  I made no changes and it was so easy. This is a keeper.  Thanks you.

I was really hesitant about adding so much garlic and the beer. It was so definitely worth it. The flavor is outstanding and it freezes so nicely.

One of the girls at work brought soem in for lunch and shared it. We all begged for the recipe and she showed us this site. I lived in Manhattan for 3 years and thought I would never eat good corned beef again when I moved to Texas but now I can make my own! This is just as good and even moister than deli style.

I had never made corned beef before, but this was super easy.  My family devours it every time.  The kids hate cabbage so we just have fries with it.  Very filling!!

I took the liberty of changing the recipe just a little, just a few minor adjustments.  No beer...

I put a 4 pound brisket into a slow cooker that is similar in shape to a small roaster.  I put the fat side up and added the season packet to the fat and rubbed/patted it on.  I then added the water (approx 1 gallon) so the beef was covered but the fat was not submerged.  I added 3 small bay leaves, 1/8 cups pepper corns, 4 crushed/minced garlic cloves and a table spoon of beef bullion and Cajun spices to the fat.  Set the cooker on low (175 degrees) and cooked for 24 hours (covered).

I didn't add any additional water after the cooking process began.

When removed from the slow cooker and used a butter knife to remove the fat, then I let it cool for about an hour.  (cool enough to handle)

I have a deli slicer...  I cut the brisket in half so that I have I good surface for the slicing machine.  I started the slicing process and it was so tender it just fell apart.  It ended up looking more like pulled pork than lunch meat.

Serving:  

Lightly browned so hearty rye in a skillet with unsalted butter.

Spread horseradish sauce to the bottom slice,
add some provolone cheese,
then stack the meat,
add sauerkraut,
then 1000 island dressing,
then your top slice of rye.

This was the best Ruben ever...

My husband and I do not like corned beef, but we were supposed to be makign this for a birthday party (it got canceled) so we ate it anyway...WOW, this was really good. I soaked the beef in water for 48 hours to remove most of the salt from it and then cooked as recipe states....it was really good. I used a whole 22 oz Guinness beer for 1/2 the recipe and then added organic beef broth and water until covered. For something that we were cringing to eat, we both ate every bite and so did the kids. Also cooked fingerling potatoes and baby carrots in the juice. This is an amazing way to make corned beef. Thank so much

This was the first time I ever made corned beef. The flavor was great and the meat was very tender.  I only made one brisket because there were only two of us, and I got a lot of mileage out of it.  The first night I made potatoes, cabbage and carrots in the broth and served it with the hot corned beef.  I wasn't crazy about the vegetables done this way.  The next night I made corned beef hash with poached eggs on top and it was excellent.  Finally, we finished up with sandwiches of corned beef, cole slaw and Russian dressing on rye.  I did them panini style and they were SO good.  I'm getting hungry for them again as I write this.

This recipe rates more than 5 stars.I cooked a 3.7 lb of  flat brisket in my slow cooker from 6:30 am to 4:30 pm on low and used 2 cans of Alpine beer plus 2 cups of water to cover it with about an inch above the meat. I added the peppercorns,garlic plus the spice packet. I let the meat sit for about 20 mins before slicing and it was wonderful. I strained some of the liquid into my dutch oven and used it to cook my vegetablse. I used small red potatoes unpeeled, baby carrots and after about 15 mins of these cooking I added my cabbage which was cut into wedges. My family who were here for dinner agreed it was the best corned beef dinner they have ever had.Thanks again All Recipes for another " favorite ".

I too wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  There is just two of us, so only made one corned beef, but did use full amount of all other ingredients (beer, garlic etc) slow cooked in a crock pot for about 9 hours and it turned out perfect.  I did have leftovers (which seems like an anomaly with this recipe) and they reheat to be just as good as they original, just remember to add some of the sauce to store the meat it and it seems to soak up even more flavor!

Have to agree with many reviewers that this deserves a lot more than just 5 stars.  This is the tenderest and tastiest corned beef I have every eaten.  My DH almost swallowed his tongue when he took the first bite of his first (of many) sandwich.  Kudos to you SDK999

Wonderful recipe!  I didn't use a whole head of garlic as the cloves were especially large.  I cooked it in the crockpot and it came out quite tender.  My husband said it was one of the best corned beef I ever made.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this tonite and it was a smash hit. Words cannot express just how yummy it was. The only thing that I added was a half more bulb of garlic (the bulbs were small), and since I made 8 lbs in a roaster oven, I added a regular size can of beef broth to make sure I had enough liquid.  It was so good and it melted in our mouths!  The seasonings and beer were perfect in this recipe.  I sliced up the brisket and made some hearty reuben sandwiches.Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I had saved it for future use.

The best recipe I've tried for corned beef. The beer gives it a great added flavor. I used the meat for sandwiches and everyone loved it. This is now my go-to recipe for cooking corned beef.

House smelled wonderful when I got home from work.  I used the crock pot and cooked for 10 hours.  Was great.  I did only use one beer.  I'm not always a fan of the hops flavor.   Next time I will try 2 beers.  The bulb of garlic and 1/4 cup peppercorn is perfect.

5 star..I made this last year for my son's Birthday.  I had so many compliments, my father could not stop talking about it!  I plan on making it every year for his Birthday because it is the day after St. Patrick's Day!

This was very good. It was my second attempt at Corned Beef, and apparently what I had been missing was the beer! I cooked this with potatoes, as well, so I had to add about 3 cups of water, as well. Next time, I will probably cut the beer in half. It provides that extra punch it needs, but I kept tasting it while I was eating my sandwich. I let this cook on low in the crock pot for 12 hours, and it just fell apart when I was cutting it. I couldn't believe how tender it was. We made Reuben sandwiches, and then corned beef hash the next day. Thanks for the killer recipe.

Wow I'm going to use this recipe for my corned beef from now on.  So easy and delicious.  The beer really helps to mellow out the taste of the meat.  I used the crockpot, it could not have been easier.  Love the taste of the peppercorns, I've never ate one before.

This was amazing; just like a reuben should taste.  I halved the recipe using 1 brisket, 1 packet, 1 can guinness, and half seasoning.  Placed in crock pot and covered with beer and water to cover.  Cook on high for 6 hours.  Super tender and flavorful!!  Will make again for St. Patrick's day!  thanks for the great recipe!!!

I LOVE corned beef & I've made this twice now. I've found that 1 dark beer or 2 light beers work best, and the 1/4 cup peppercorns is WAY too much. I added in cut potatoes, cut onions, and baby carrots for the last 1 hour of cooking.

This is so easy and so yummy.  I have made this in the crockpot, on the stove top, and in the oven @ 250* F.  Cooking time for this is between 5 to 8 hours but i find the longer you can wait the better.  I usally use 2 bottles of guiness and if more liquid is needed to cover use water.

This is THE BEST CORNED BEEF RECIPE ever! Dont bother looking thru countless corned beef recipes on this site, you have just found the BEST ONE. Seriously. I followed the instructions pretty much the same, except I rubbed the corn beef brisket with 1/2 cup brown sugar, as well as the spice packet that comes with the brisket, and bay leaf, garlic and peppercorns. Put it in my crockpot and dumped 2 cans of Guinness on top. Make sure you add enough water to cover meat completely. Cooked overnight for 10 hours. The meat was done to mouthwatering perfection. After the 10 hour mark I took meat out, and added chopped carrots, potatoes and onions to broth (I dont really like cabbage so I omitted that) Cooked those for 1-2 hours til tender, remove and serve!!  HANDS DOWN THE BEST CORNED BEEF IVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!! WOW!!!

Very good. Cooked it in the crockpot for.....seven hours? Made one so I cut the recipe in half. I served it with Diane's Colcannon. Great dinner. NOTE: I used all beer instead of part water and I used Bud Light.

Really good!   I did not add the extra peppercorns, just used the two packets that came with the meat.  This will now be the only way I will prepare corned beef.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Oh. My. Gosh.  This was sooo good.  I'm only sorry I didn't discover corned beef and how easy it is to cook sooner!  Halved the recipe minus the peppercorns; came out tender and delicious.  I'm going to sneak another bite right now!

Wish this sight gave more than 5 starz because this rates 20. Ate this at my neighbor house and she showed me the recipe so I did it myself. I agree with the person who said you have to TRY to mess it up. I love it my family loves it my boss loves the leftovers I brought to him.

Made this last weekend and it was fantastic!  I did it in the crock pot like many others.  It was great.  I cooked some carrots, potatoes and cabbage in the juice and they had great flavor too.  The leftovers made the best Reuben sandwich.  thanks SDK for the great recipe and the helpful tips!

I would rate this just average.  I have made corned beef a number of times and the included spice package seems to provide most of the flavor.  The beer/bayleaf/garlic didn't do anything extra for me.  If you have never made corned beef before, be aware there is quite a bit of shrinkage during cooking and once you trim off the excess fat after cooking, the meat won't serve as many as you originally thought.  If you mince a few cloves of garlic you get just as much flavor as adding the entire bulb which is really unnecessary.  Most of the garlic flavor comes from mincing individual gloves.  The picture shown is rather misleading since unless you own a deli style slicer, you will never be able to slice the cooked corned beef that thin.

For all of those out there with Celiac disease (can't eat wheat, rye or barley)....  I used Busch's Redbridge gluten free beer to make this and it turned out wonderful.  This is a keeper!

I didn't have a chance to eat this as a sandwich (not yet, anyway) because it was too good to let other flavors mess with it.  YUM!  I slow cooked mine on HIGH for just over 7 hours (I think it's necessary to cook it on high in the crock due to the need for it to SIMMER) and then cooked some potatoes and carrots seperately (not using the juices).  Followed the recipe to a T and cannot wait, let me say that again, I CANNOT WAIT to try some Reubens this week and I am already looking forward to my hash cakes for dinner tonight.  SDK999, you've made a believer out of this once corned beef hating gal.  Thanks!

Awesome!  This recipe is a homerun.  Moist and really flavorable.  Instead of adding water to cover, I added more beer  :-)  It made the best Reuben sandwiches!

As naples34102 said in her review, look no further! My husband found a 3 lb. store brand flat cut corned beef in the bottom of the freezer last week (frozen a year ago).  I wanted to try this recipe and I'm so glad I did!  I reduced the recipe by half and followed the recipe to a tee, something I almost never do.  I chose Newcastle beer because I've cooked with stout beers in the past and we found that they overpowered the delicate flavors of the other ingredients.  I cooked this in my 4 quart slow cooker - I fit it in by cutting the brisket in half, added the garlic, pepper corns, beer, additional 3 cups of water, and the full seasoning packet.  Cooked on high for 2.5 hours then on low for an additional 3....plus? hours.  I removed the meat and tented on a cutting board, poured the liquid into a pot.  I cooked my veggies in the liquid for 15-20 minutes while Hubs was slicing the brisket (against the grain).  All I heard during the meal was, "mmm"  "mmm", and finally "Honey, this is the best corned beef you've ever made!"  I asked him to rate it from 1 to 5 and he immediately said, "11 !!"  I don't think the leftover brisket will make it between 2 pieces of bread!  I can see why the submitter makes 2 or 3 at a time!!  Sometimes simple is best and this recipe is a perfect example.  Thank you so much this recipe, Suze!

Being from Cleveland I am a huge fan of corned beef.  I have tried many recipe versions, mixing this spice with that beer and this cooking method with that cooking method.  All produced acceptable corned beef, but nothing reminiscent of that taste I get from back home.  When I saw this simple recipe with all the peppercorns and garlic cloves, color me dubious at best.  

As the hours ticked by (I used my crockpot), curiosity got the best of me and I tasted the pot liquor from the brisket.   Immediately I was impressed by the flavor.  About the 8 hour mark, my fork test passed so I turned off the crock-pot and allowed the brisket to sit in the liquid for about another hour or so.  I then removed the brisket and put it in the fridge to cool. 

The next day I broke out my meat slicer and sliced the cooled brisket thin against the grain.  I had reserved the cooking liquid and defatted it, thinking the brisket may need extra juice – wrong.  When the meat was gently warmed it gave off enough liquid so my slices and sandwiches were very juicy.  

I used one bottle of Guinness Stout, one brisket – about 3.5 pounds, 1/8 C cup of peppercorns, half of a bulb of garlic -about 10 cloves, and I did use the entire spice packet from the brisket.  Everything else was prepared to recipe.  

Perfect.  I am no longer looking for the best recipe.  This is it.

Made the recipe exactly as written, except i used my slow cooker.  This was by far the BEST corned beef I've ever made or eaten! I put everything in my slow cooker at 6am and by 6pm I was slicing the most flavorful, moist corned beef ever!  I'm 1/2 Irish and make corned beef every year. I wish I would have found this recipe a long time ago. It will definitely be my go to recipe from here on out!

I halved the recipe since I only had 1 brisket. I added in a can of beef broth, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Yummy!! I dipped the sourdough bread into the sauce and added the sliced corned beef and it was a huge hit with my teen boys and husband! This is the first time I've had anything other than canned corned beef--never again going for the can! Thanks for an easy recipe that was delicious!

Have made this several times and it is so simple and absolutely tasty. Don't know why I never reviewed it! It makes a great main dish and awesome Reubens the next night! I find the thin slices for the sandwich are much easier to cut after it has been in the fridge.

If you use a crockpot instead of the stovetop, do you still add water to cover the top?

My family loved this, including my 9 and 11 year old kids.  The 1/4 cup of peppercorns not to much.  Excellent recipe with be making this for years to come.

I had never made corned beef before having not liked it as a kid when my mom made it but this converted me! It was really delicious. Followed recipe exactly and will be making far more often.

Absolutely delicious!  The mistake I made was halving this recipe for one brisket instead of two.  I could not get enough of this!

Very good. I used 2 irish beers, 1 Tablespoon of garlic, 1 beef boulon, 3 bottles of water (used the beer bottle to measure), and 1 packet of spice mix. Save the broth because I boiled my potatoes for my mashed potatoes and they were EXCELLENT!

This was very good! I made mine in the slow cooker (low for 8 hours) and it came out so tender, juicy and flavorful. This was a hit at our annual St. Patrick's Day dinner and a definate do-over recipe~no changes necessary! Thanks for sharing. :)

LOVED this!!!! Corned my own brisket and threw it in the crockpot. Didn't have any beer so just used water and wasn't brave enough to use that much garlic (only used about 5-6 cloves, but will use more next time). Only corned one brisket, but next time I will make sure that  I do two. Made this for Christmas morning so I could make corned beef hash. Let it sit in the cooker until morning and was perfect!!! Chopped it up (so tender it pretty much fell apart)  and threw it in a pan with some cooked potatoes until browned up. Will make this again for sure. Thanks for the recipe SDK999.

I made this for some friends over St Pat's Day. They all thought I was nuts using so much garlic and peppercorn. It was fabulous, and I'm not a big fan of corned beef myself. This is the only corned beef recipe I'll be making from  here forward.

Excellent! I am glad I doubled the recipe so I had plenty of leftovers. I used Guinness and I did really like biting into a soft peppercorn for a kick, but next time will use 1/2 the amount as the pepper was too overpowering for younger taste buds. My mouth is still watering thinking about how good this tasted.

WOW!  This is a good as the deli I used to go to for corned beef sandwiches!  I only had one brisket, but kept all of the other measurments the same. I love the taste so much, I'm hoping my SO,who is from Mexico, might not like the taste so I can keep it all for myself!  I laughed out loud with the reviewer who said they ate it on tortillas.... and I thought my house was mixed up! Ok, ok, I admit that I made the corned beef with Corona beer today....  Thanks so much for the fab recipe.... I will use it often!

Yum!! I made this in the slow cooker on high for 5 hours and it came out great! I did have trouble finding brisket that came with spices though. I found some Maple Leaf brisket, which I think was already in a spice broth in the bag, and used that. Slice it up, put on toasted rye with butter and mustard and YUM!!

My crockpot is small - it just held a single 4 pound corn beef and the beer and spices, no room for anything else. I put it in for 10 hours on 'low', but my 'low' is VERY low - at 10 hours it was still somewhat firm. At 14 hours, though, it was LIKE BUTTER, totally delectable and perfect. So you need to know your own crock pot, but this was an ideal, ideal recipe (great for shabbos / yuntiv too).

This was fantastic, great flavor and easy to make. I followed the recipe as directed and then I copied the way CreativeCook added the potatoes, carrots and cabbage.
I will be making this at least once a month for lunches at work

Though the recipe says for this to be done in a large pot and simmered all day, I actually did it in my crockpot.  And, I know you're not supposed to try out new recipes on guests, but I did serve this for the first time to a guest.  Thank goodness it turned out as well as it did.  This is probably the best hot sandwich recipe I've ever made.  It makes for a very nice luncheon.  I highly recommend.

I used beef broth instead of the beer.
While setting - strain liquid and use to cook veggies - small unpeeled red potatoes and baby carrots. Cook 15 minutes. Add cabbage wedges if desired.

Like many other reviewers, I made this as a corned beef and cabbage dinner. I put my brisket in the crockpot in a hurry and forgot to put in the garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns. It was still very yummy so don't fret if you do the same thing I did. Having said that, I do look forward to doing the recipe again with all of the ingredients! :-)

My crockpot is pretty small. I hardly had enough room for the brisket itself! So when it came time to add the veggies, there was no way to fit them in. I simply took the brisket out and put it in a shallow dish with a few spoonfulls of juices and covered it loosely with aluminum foil. While that was resting, I poured the remaining stock from the crockpot into a big stockpot. I added baby carrots and chunks of red potatoes. Bring these to a boil and cook over medium for 10 to 12 minutes. Then add the cabbage and cook for 5 to 7 minutes. We like our veggies tender-crisp so you may want to up the time if you like your veggies a little more tender. Make sure the veggies have enough liquid as well. You may need to add water or broth to keep them covered.

Great recipe!

Mega-YUM!!  This is the 4th time to make this and I thought it was time to review it.  Each time I made this, it came out perfectly tender and delicious.  I have made for sandwiches alone and now with cabbage and veggies and it always turns out the best.  Thank you for a surefire good meal sdk999.

My hubby said this is the best corned beef I've ever made--almost as good as what he used to get in New York.  That's high praise!  I used a 6-lb. center cut brisket; added some red chili flakes and used beef broth instead of water. My beef didn't come with a spice packet, so I used about 3 tbsp. pickling spice instead. I don't know how much of a difference the type of beer makes, but I used a 22 oz. can of Sapporo Reserve (we don't drink, so didn't want to by a 6-pack).

I've made this twice and will continue to make it when I want a hearty slow cooker meal. It's really easy to put together and makes great sandwiches. I've found that it's really hard to slice this thin, so I just cut it into chunks. I also take 2-3 cups of the leftover liquid and whisk in a few TB of flour over the stove to make delicious gravy to put over mashed potatoes.

Wonderfull as is. I don't bring it to a boil though, I just set my crock pot on low and let it simmer for 8-10 hours. I usually always used a generic beer, like Budwieser or Miller. I'd like to try it with a higher end beer with a richer flavor!

This turned out super tender and was really good. I cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours. I was initially going to try to slice it, but it was just way too tender so I ended up shredding it. I didn't have any beer on hand so I just used beef broth. Next time I'll try it with beer to see if it makes a difference.

This is came out even better than restaurant-quality. And I even made it with freezer-burned corned beef that I probably should have thrown away! It was so simple, and with some toasted rye, canned sauerkraut and simple Thousand Island Dressing (also from allrecipes.com), it was just amazing. Reubens are one of those sandwiches I never liked as a kid, but this recipe has made me a Reuben believer.

This recipe is definitely worth making! I made it for my fiance to take for in sandwiches for lunch at work. I used cibatta bread, and provolone cheese, also added mustard and mayo. He loves them so much that he is even eating them on his day off-he NEVER does that. He says that it's the best sandwich he has ever had. I will be using this recipe a LOT!

I made this exactly as written. The roast itself was very tender. I will do this again, but flavor it according to my family's tastes. The method is great, but it isn't exactly what my family likes. Overall, it's a great recipe.

This is the first time that I have cooked Corned Beef and I was really disappointed.  I will not be trying this recipe again (or eating corned beef).  I thought that the meat needed more seasoning and less beer.

Exceptional recipe!  Only thing I do different is use butchers twin to tie the beef in three or four places.  This keeps it from falling apart when you remove from cooker (slow or on stove top). Then, after cooled a bit, I remove string, place on sided-cookie sheet, cover with tin foil and STEP on it.  YES, step on it.  This flattens the beef and it will slice exactly like it was made in a deli.  ENJOY.

This the first time I have ever made corned beef brisket.  I love deli corned beef so I was anxious to try it!  There are two cuts of corned beef at the store at St. Paddy's time, flat and point brisket.  I got the point brisket because it was literally 10.00 cheaper a pound than flat.  I learned you get what you pay for.  Although the corned beef turned out tasting decent, it was soooooo fatty that the actual meat we were able to consume was about 1/2 of the orignal size of the meat.  I made it exactly accoring to recipe, with the exception of making it in a slow cooker rather than on the stove.  Thank you for sharing!!

THIS IS FANTASTIC!!  What can I say?? Used my crock pot and it was cooked to perfection!  After removing the meat, simmered the baby red potatoes, carrots and cabbage. My best friend stopped by, was not expecting her, so she had to have a plate..her and the family could not stop raving about how good it was. (I just love when that happens). I did find a recipe for a sauce to compliment the meat..1T. horseradish, 1/2c. sour cream, 1/4c. mayo, 2T. mustard and 2t. Dijon, mix together and chill till supper. Anyway, this was out of the world with it. It went perfect with the meal. So..this morning I made corned beef hash and it was really OUT OF THIS WORLD!! We put a couple of fried eggs on top..the yolk oozing down over the hash...YUMMY! DH had never had it before, and he loved it. Tasted just like my grandma Kanady use to make. Give this recipe a try, you will not be disappointed. Thanks for sharing with us!!

AMAZING that something so easy can taste so good. I first had this at my friend's house and she sent me a link to the recipe. I never got around to making it until yesterday and I could kick myself for waiting so long. I noticed a review said their's was too salty but since that's what makes the beef "corned" I always rinse mine thoroughly before cooking. I cooked 3 pieces of meat and pulled 2 of them out after they were done then added potaotes and carrots to the liquid for 15 minutes and then put the cabbage pieces in for another 30 minutes and we had a wonderful dinner. The other 2 pieces were wrapped in plastic and put in the fridge to use for sandwiches. I sliced it nice and thin this morning and piled onto rye bread with swiss and brown mustard. My husband called at 11:00 to tell me he couldn't wait till noon to have his lunch and to rave at how great his sandwich was. My son texted me to say he wants two more of these sandwiches waiting for him when he gets home from school.  Can you say W-I-N-N-E-R?  This one is a keeper for sure!

I did this in the crock pot for St. Patty's.  Don't make the mistake of making only 1 corned beef, because they shrink like crazy, and mine was super fatty.  Make 2 like the recipe says.  It was in the crock pot from 8:00 am to 6:00 PM, and was from the fridge when I started it.

I thought it was an "ok" recipe, but would not be a favorite, or regular. Mine was a little on the salty side which could have been the corned beef itself. Happy cooking!

This is basically the way I cook my corned beef every year with the exception of the garlic.  I did add that this year and it was terrific!  I add two bottles of beer to my corned beef every year and I swear it makes the difference.  Don't be afraid to try it.  If you don't want the alcoholic content, I would suggest using O'Douls Amber.  It is a non alcoholic beer and is darker and richer than the regular O'Douls but you'll still get some of that beer taste and tenderization.

I never have had corned beef and never wanted too, but my hubby likes it and so I thought I would try this for St. Patty's day.  This recipe is woderfully good!  I just used regular beer too because I did not realize until after I purchased my budweiser that the Irish use stout beer, but no matter.  This was wonderful and I added potatoes, carrots, and cabbage when I got home from work, but it wouldn't all fit in my crock pot so I took the meet out and put in a casserole dish to keep warm, while i poured out the juice it cooked in into a regular pot and placed the cut up veggies in it and boiled/simmered it for about 30 minutes.  Well I can tell you that i now love corned beef and will make this again to make the sandwiches.  my husband and sons really liked it too!

This turned out too stringy for me and I didn't love the taste of the beer we had in our fridge (maybe Guiness would have been better).  I prefer mine roasted and a little sweeter I think.

This is a wonderful recipe; the extra pepper and garlic gives it the character of great deli corned beef. Because of time constraints, I did one (everything halved) in the crockpot ON A RACK that elevated the meat about 3/4", with 1" of liquid. This was based on some research I had done about how best to cook CB. Not immersing is supposed to retain the meat texture and juices better.  Well, it was very juicy and tender, and had a wonderful grain even though when I first checked at 9 hours, it was possibly overdone (almost 180 degrees). This was the best home-made corned beef I have ever made, and I'd love to shave it and taste-test against the best restaurant corned beef.

Well, first of all, I totally messed up by only making one brisket. I thought that would be plenty. WRONG! Oh my, where has this recipe been my whole life?! I've had reubens before, but never had corned beef on it's own and the reubens I've had have never made me really want corned beef by itself. This beef was amazing... tender to the core, perfectly seasoned, just delicious. My fiance loves corned beef and he said this was the best he's ever had. I used one brisket, 5 cloves of garlic, no peppercorns (forgot to buy them), and even though I used only one brisket I still used the entire spice pack. I can't imagine it possible to make this taste any better. I cooked the brisket in my slow cooker for 8 hours on low, then added potatoes and carrots. Let those cook for an hour, then removed the meat (tented it in foil), and added wedges of cabbage and cooked for another 30 minutes on high. Absolute perfection... the vegetables were as tender and flavorful as any I've had. There is no way I will wait until next St. Patrick's Day to make this again. Thank you!

This was really salty but I'm giving it 5 stars because it was delicious.  After asking around on the recipe exchange, I found that corned beef is salty and varies from brand to brand and that cannot be helped by the submitter.  This was perfect after 8 hours in my slow cooker.  Otherwise, I followed the directions of the recipe.  I plan to use the leftovers in Reuben Sandwiches later this week.  NOTE:  We do not drink/like beer and this did not taste like beer at all.

I've never had corned beef before and absolutely hate beer but I tried this anyway.  I'm so glad that I did!  I halved the recipe and still some how managed to put a 22 oz of guinness in there and didn't realize what I'd done until after it went in.  I was worried that I'd messed it up but it still turned out yummy :).  I used the leftover liquid to cook some potatoes and carrots... so flavorful and good!!!! I wouldn't recommend doing that for people who do not like salty things because the vegetables do come out a bit salty.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic!  I had never made corned beef before so I was nervous about how it may turn out but was very pleasantly surprised!  I toasted some slices of marble rye with swiss, piled on the meat (sliced easily after sitting on the cutting board for about 15 minutes) and added some 1000-Island dressing.  Even the picky younger boys enjoyed.  Made me wish I was Irish!  ;)

Made as is with one 4.49 pound brisket. Cook in the crock pot for 10 hours. Made the Irish Sode bread to go with it. AWESOME! My husband raved about it.

I have been making this same corned beef for a long time. This is truly the best way!  I have done both slow cook on the stove for about 3 hours, which comes out great. I prefer to cook this in the crock pot because it is truly the most tender way...for me 8 hours works!  I like to make enough for ruebens the next day!

This recipe is so incredibly delicious, moist and easy! I am sure the recipe would be perfect the way it is, but made the following minor changes due to personal preferences:  I cooked the corned beef in a crockpot on High for 8 hours, used just half of a garlic bulb and 1/8 cup of peppercorns.  After removing it from the crockpot, I covered it with aluminum foil and let it rest on a platter for 20 minutes before cutting it. My friends raved about how wonderful it was and asked for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you for sharing it!

This is truly THE best way to make a corned beef. The only comment I would add is that unless you like your corned beef very "spicey", back up a bit on the peppercorns.

Other than that, it has an overall excellent flavor and comes extremely tender.

I have never thrown out a whole piece of meat until tonight. I cooked it in the slow cooker for 10 hours, let it rest, and couldn't even cut it because it was so tough. I am about to call my son who is on his way over for dinner to tell him to pick up something else. Very disappointed.

I followed directions exactly and it was the most bitter corned beef we have ever tasted.  If you make this, do not us the pepper corns or all of the garlic.  It was terrible and we love corned beef.

Great recipe! Seems like a lot of peppercorns & garlic, but it turned out wonderful. I only made one 3-1/2 # roast but kept the seasoning amounts the same. Only thing I did not like...was doing on the stove though:I had to add water 3-4 times. So, next time I will just make in my slow cooker on high and not have to keep checking.

This was super easy and made great corned beef.  I used an Irish beer, of course, and didn't change a thing in the recipe.  Once the beef is cooked, let it cool in the fridge and it will slice beautifully.  We made Rueben's from the sliced meat that were awesome.

I have to agree about 5 stars being not nearly enough!  Fantastic corned beef.  We had a craving for reubens, so I went to the deli for corned beef.  Price?  $8.99 lb.  Well, screw that idea!  I bought a bagged CB and found this recipe when I got home.  Next morning put everything in the slowcooker.  No regrets!  Wonderful!!  Also, I used O'Doule's Amber since we don't drink.  Great stuff for cooking.

Wow! I made this last night, and stuck pretty close to the recipe as written. The only two things I did differently were to replace most of the water (to cover) with organic beef broth, and I had to use a heavy bowl to keep the meat under the liquid (it kept floating to the top and left parts of the meat out of the liquid. I didn't want that meat to dry out). Outstanding! The meat came out juicy, tender, flavorful, and none of the added flavors overpowered any of the other flavors (I was a bit worried about all of that garlic and pepper). Best of all, meat was not too salty, as other briskets can be. 

I used 2 cans of Miller Lite for the beer, and am anxious to try a beer with a bit more 'body' and flavor next time. Great recipe! I won't make Corned Beef any other way!

I've always just thrown a corned beef in the pot with the packet it comes with and added potatoes, cabbage and carrots later.  NEVER AGAIN!

This was so fantastic!  There was extra flavor, the beer made the fragrance wafting through the house a tad more interesting and it was by far the tenderest corned beef I've ever had.  I love this recipe.

Only twist I made was I just made the corned beef and did not go onto the sandwich stage.  For a party, especially a Paddy's Day party, I definitely would try that, though.

Awesome!  Still tender and yummy after being in the fridge.  I used rye bread that I toasted and topped the beef with tomatoes, pickles and swiss cheese.  Then I broiled it and added the coleslaw.  My boyfriend doesn't like the boiled dinner, but he loved this!

Incredible! My family is already asking me to make this recipe again. Since most of the reviews said it was perfect as-is I didn't change anything. Good thing cause there's not reason to.  It's perfectly moist, tender and delicious.

Best EVER! we made it for son's graduation party along with baked hams and roasted turky breasts. Followed recipes to the letter and then put the braskets int the fridge over night. Everybody who tried the sandwiches asked "wher did you buy the cornedbeef" and we told them we made it ourselfs. This one goes in our "keeper" file.

This was my first attempt at corned beef.  Mine didn't come with the spice packets and it still came out amazing. I made the most amazing corned beef & swiss sandwiches with my panini press. I used the leftovers to make corned beef hash for Easter and everyone LOVED it.

This was very good!  I halved the recipe and cooked in a crockpot for about 9 hours.  Added cubed potatoes for the last hour - delicious.  We ate just the meat the first night, then used left overs to make Rubens.  Very good and will be making again.

Made as written, but cooked everything in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours. Sliced some for initial sandwhich, but wrapped the rest of the corned beefs in foil and placed in fridge. The next day, used our deli slicer to thinly slice the rest of the meat. Perfect, easy, and delicious corned beef! The flavor reminded my husband of a corned beef he used to get an old deli in Chicago, which closed many years ago. Thanks for the recipe!

I read many corned beef recipes prior to st patties and went with this one after reading the reviews. It really is the best corned beef recipe. I've adapted it a little for our family, using beef broth instead of beer and cooking it in the slow cooker for 8-9 hours on low. For St Patties, about 1 hr before serving, I remove some of the broth to use for cooking diced potatoes, cabbage, and carrots in another pan on the stove. (there usually isn't room in my slow cooker or I'd just add the veggies for the final hour of cooking).  If you take out most of the broth, turn off the slow cooker to prevent burning your meat.

Chilling the beef before slicing allows for super thin, uniform slices. Also easier to remove all fat when chilled. 3.5 lb is  enough for 4-6 servings, once cooked. I serve hot with Easy Colcannon.

This was the first time I have ever made corn beef. I only made one and split the ingredients because I wasn't sure how it would come out. My kids (pickiest eaters ever) loved it! I followed the recipe exactly... Wow

I only made one, vs. two, that the recipe called for.  I did mine in my crock pot, and the only thing I did different was omitted the water, and added extra beer.  It was very delicious, and tender.  I cooled it for about 10 hours before slicing, and it turned out perfect.  Next time, I will be making two, as one is not enough!

This is a DELICIOUS recipe!  I will never make corned beef any other way.  I'm using it for the third St. Paddy's Day in a row.  The only recommendations that I will offer is to trim most of the fat from the briskets,  use both peppercorn packets, and definitely use an Irish stout such as Guinness for the beer.

Never cooked corn beef before.  Followed recipe exactly.  First time tried to cut after ten minutes didn't slice well.  Took the advice from other reviews  and wrapped the meat in aluminum foil and put in the fridge overnight.  Sliced perfect the next day.  This was a hit, everyone loved it!

This recipe is 'spot on'. It's critical to use Guinness and NOT a domestic beer like Bud or Coors or Miller. The only thing I changed was adding about 6 pieces of bacon to the crockpot. WOW! This took the taste of the corned beef to a whole other level.

WOW.....this was amazing. I used Guiness for the beer and didn't have a garlic bulb so added the spice pack with 4 tsp of minced garlic into a spice bag for flavoring. I also made this in the crockpot cooking it for approximately 8 hours.  I then used the juice (which didn't need a thing added to it) and cooked my carrots, cabbage, potato and onion on the stove.  I drained the broth and used it to pour over the corned beef.

I used two 3 lb briscuts and one package of the seasoning that came with one of them.  I did use the full head of garlic and peeled skin off each clove.  I also rinsed the briscuts well before putting in the slow cooker.  I cooked 5 hours on 2 and 3 to keep constant light boil going.  Excellent

This came out better than any corned beef recipe I've made before!  It was incredibly tender, and fell apart when I tried to slice it, so I probably wouldn't use it for sandwiches.

This is my 4th year making this recipe and I always look forward to it for weeks.  2 of those years I double the recipe and fed the neighborhood.  Tried it in the crock pot once, not nearly as tender as on the stove top so stick with that.  Have used both Guiness and Murphy's Irish Stoudt.  Murphy's gives a better flavor to the meat, IMO.  Add some cabbage, potatoes and onions to the cooking liquid when done for a meal the night you make it.  Then hopefully have plenty of leftovers to slice thin on seeded rye with swiss, russian dressing, and Amish creamed cabbage (much better than coleslaw).  Thank you for sharing!!!

My family loved this.  I started it in the crockpot but switched it to the pressure cooker and it turned out GREAT!  We served it with steamed cabbage and red potatoes with fresh rosemary and garlic.  The 3 combined were a huge hit.  I also halved the recipe.

haven't tried this yet but has to be rated in order to pose question.  The corned beef I buy is in a plastic packet with spices in it.  Normally you boil bag and all.   To cook in slow cooker would I take it out of the bag?  Thank you for the help

I made this last night and it was to die for. I didn't change a thing other than using a crock pot. I cooked it all day, started on high for a couple of hours and then 
turned to low later. It was so tender and moist, full of flavor. Our friends raved about it. I took another reviewers suggestion of putting coleslaw and swiss cheese out so everyone could build their own sandwich however they wanted. I also used sliced sour dough bread which I grilled. There was hardly anything left over. I'll never eat corned beef any other way now!

I can't believe I didn't review this recipe-I made it last St Paddy's Day. I have tried for at least 20 years to get tender corned beef.  nothing worked until now. HUbby almost didn't try it because it was different.  OMG will never ever make corned beef any other way than this.

Best Corned Beef I've ever had.  I did use both spice packets instead of just one.  Took meat out of pot and threw in some carrots and onions let simmer for about 20 minutes then added cabbage and brussel sprouts to cook some.  Best tasting cabbage ever.  What a meal.  Finished the corned beef later by making sandwiches.  Wonderful.

Save yourself time and money pre rinse the slimmy packaged corned beef in cold water pop it into the crockpot. Add any kind of  beer you like save the other beer it is not needed. Add just the one spice packet that came with the corned beef.  No garlic is needed the one spice packet that came with the corned bee and the one beer is just as good.  Cook for 6 to 7 hours on low in the crock pot.  Slice corned beef  on a meat slicer to get that thin delli type sandwich meat.  Discard the juice or put a few tablespoons over the sliced meat no more then a few as the meast is very salty already.

Holy moly, that was delicious! I used a Woodchuck Amber instead of a regular beer and my roast floated around in the beer water so I didn't have to worry about it drying out.  Not sure why it floated.  Maybe cause I did it in a dutch oven?  Regardless, this was DELICIOUS!  I will totally make that again!

FANTASTIC!!!! If I could more than 5 stars, I would I've tried to make Corned Beef and Cabbage for my husband of 40 years several times.  Each time, he asked me not to try again. I decided to try 1 more time. My husband loved it!!!  Couldn't stop eatting it. And it only took me 40 years to find 'THE' recipe The only thing I changed was I cooked it in a slow cooker and added veggies after meat cooked 8 hours.   Thank you, so much, SDK999.

My husband insists on Corned Beef on St. Patrick's Day.  Not my favorite thing until I found this.  I have made it the last 2 years and those of us who had been choking it down once a year, now actually enjoy it.  I make it just as written and it is good every time.  Thanks for the recipe.
UPDATE- last time I made it I added potatoes and carrots. DO NOT add them, cook them separate they absorbed too much of the beer and were terrible. I do cook this in the slow cooker for 5-6 hours, so easy and good.

Great, simple.  The beer imparts a good flavor.  I added some onion and carrots to mine for extra flavoring and it turned out fantastic.  I was looking through for the bad reviews on this one because I'm always curious about those.  I noticed some people said their brisket turned out tough even though they left it in the crock pot eight hours.  There are only two explanations for that.  1) You didn't leave it in the crock pot for eight hours.  2) You didn't cook the meat in the crockpot long enough, like eight or nine hours.  I've yet to come across something that doesn't get tender after about eight hours in a crockpot, whether you make it with beer or water or nothing at all.   Great for sandwiches.  If you want to make a full meal out of this one throw in some cabbage, potatoes, carrots, and onions and you're set!  PS, I would mince the garlic, or cut the whole bulb in half horizontally.

I joined this forum just so I could rate this FANTASTIC recipe. I have used it several times and it is the only way I will make corned beef in the year's to come. The flavor is wonderful and it melts in your mouth. I can't believe something so simple can end up perfect every time.

I halved the recipe since I only had one brisket.  I followed the recipe except I cooked it in a crock pot. I used a bottle of Shiner Bock beer (and yes, I teared up a little as I poured it into the pot). I cooked it on low for about 10 hours then refrigerated overnight.  The next night I made Reuben sandwiches.  The meat was really good, but not what I would consider Deli quality.

I didn't have a lot of time, so I cooked the brisket according the recipe for 4 hours on high in a crockpot, but it wasn't tender enough to serve, so I put it on low and went to bed.  The next morning the smell was delicious and the meat was ultra tender!  My husband at his with honey, but I loved it with spicy mustard and honey mustard.  I'd never made it before, but I'll make it again!  There were no leftovers after I served it to my family.

This was fairly flavorful. I don't know what it was that I did wrong but it turned out a bit dry.

Outstanding recipe!..but, there are only two of us, both Rueben Sandwich connisoures. The smallest brisket at our market was 4 pounds, which seemed way too big for us, so we bought a half pound of sliced deli corned beef.  I followed the recipe, boiled it,and simmered it in Guiness, half a bay leaf, two cloves of garlic for 3 hours...it was fall-apart tender.  Made Ruebens with bag kraut and pumpernickle bread, 1000 Island dressing and Swiss cheese...it was every bit as good, or better, than any resturant or deli Rueben we have tried!...Great recipie...by all means a winner...even if you don't have the brisket..sliced deli meat works just fine!!

Nothing to change Used a slow cooker on low for 6.9 hours and was amazed at the result, Use to roast 2 hours or so and thought it was great,  This is definitely better.  Thanks SDK999

I never made or I guess really ate corned beef before.  I didn't realize that I'm really not a fan of it.  This recipe is a great recipe and my family really liked it.  The only way I liked it was when I added coleslaw to the sandwich (made restaurant style coleslaw from this site, it was perfect).  Otherwise I had to pass.  Because it was pretty easy and everyone else thought it was great, I am giving it 5 stars.  I wish I could have enjoyed it as much as everyone else though but thats my own fault, darn my taste buds. :(

I'm giving this 5 stars. It was easy and delicious! This is a keeper for me. I  made sandwiches; however, it would have made a wonderful dinner served with potatoes and cabbage. The meat was tasty and tender.

What can I said that hasn't been said before?  It was delicious and I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner.  SDK, this is a jewel.  I appreciate you sharing such a delightful and most importantly in my case, easy recipe that will be repeated over and over again.

You weren't joking when you said easy and make a lot!  Those are both true statements!  I used Guiness Draft beer, and seved it with pumpernickle bread and spicy brown mustard.  We also made irish soda bread...Very fun and easy food--Oh the cabbage I cooked on the stove and in huge boiling pot with the left over juices.  Yummy

I followed this recipe as stated.  I used Guinness as my beer choice.  Cooked this in a Dutch oven on the stove top for six hours.  Wrapped meat in foil and let it rest for 30 minutes while veggies cooked.  Strained the broth and cooked potatoes, carrots, onion and cabbage in the left over broth.  Had company over for dinner and everyone thought that this was excellent.  Meat was very tender with great flavor.  Veggies took on the great flavor too.  Looking forward to a sandwich with the leftovers.  Thank you for the recipe.  Update:  I have made this many times now and love it every time.  I now use a corned beef round instead of a brisket and it is even better.

Excellent! I followed this recipe exactly - and doubled it. I made it last night and made sandwiches tonight. The corned beef is much easier to slice thin after being refrigerated overnight. Thanks for the recipe!

I must have done something wrong....it just wasnt good for me. Cooked in a dutch oven for 5 hours....just didnt taste right.  As the recipe says, maybe it is better on a sandwich... which I will try tomorrow.

OK, This is the second year I have made this, you can do it in a crock pot but it turns out better on the stove top,why I don't know but it does! 4 1/2 hours remove it scape the fat off, wrap in foil place in the fridge for about 15 mins then slice thin across the grain and enjoy! as far as the people who give this a bad review, maybe you don't like corned beef, or you just can't follow directions, because this is fantastic!

Absolutely delicious!!  Made it Friday for my husband and he devoured it. Used the leftovers for sandwiches over the weekend.  He asked me this morning (monday) if I would make it for him again for St. Patrick's day.  Followed recipe to a T.  My husband said it was the best corned beef he has ever eaten and I agree!!

You have to try this! I made it last year and can't wait for corned beef to go on sale after St Patty's day so I can stock my freezer! Excellent for sandwiches. My husband would eat it right out of the frig! great in casseroles or with noodles. Delicious and can be use so many ways!

Awesome!  I made this last night when I didn't really want to take much time on making dinner.  I didn't have all day so cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours then cooked it on low for an hour.  I moved it back up to high for the last hour because I added the veggies (potatoes, carrots, and cabbage) and they brought the temp down.  Will definitely make this again - all the other reviews are spot on!

This is the only way I make my corned beef. I usually use a stout ale, and I will say that I have never used that much peppercorns, but that is just me. I cook my cabbage in the reserved liquid but never my potatoes because they soak up too much of the salty flavor. One year I made a brown sugar glaze and brushed it on top of the finished meat and then baked it in the oven for a bit to seal it on the beef. It was excellent, but it does require extra time and effort.

Very good and very easy.  I make 2 briskets based on others reviews and was not disappointed I made so much.  Do yourself a favor and when you make this throw some small red creamers in the bottom of the slow cooker.  Then make yourself corned beef hash with the leftovers!

This Corned Beef had great flavor, was easy to make, but hard to slice and mostly tough. Maybe it was the cut of meat that I purchased, but if I'm going to make hot Reuben sandwiches, I will stick to buying it at the deli. We all enjoyed the meal, so I just don't know if it is worth the work/time involved...

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time I would have given it a ten the second time a two or three.  My conclusion is that the brand of corned beef can make a big difference and not the recipe.  Loved the recipe...I also love to save the broth and use it to make homemade soups.

Incredibly tasty recipe. I followed it exactly and we had the best corned beef sandwiches my family has ever had. I will have to make a double batch the next time because there were not leftovers for us to enjoy. I served with melted swiss cheese and cole slaw and they were better than any I've ever had in a deli.

This was very good.  I particularly liked how it firmed up the next day. I was able to trim the fat, and slice it thinly for sandwiches, or a little thicker for dinner.

I do wonder if this would be a good crockpot recipe.  I don't always have that much time to watch a pot.

My wife (Izzy) convinced me to join this groups o I could review the best corned beef recipe I have ever tasted. I am the world's greatest corned beef fan and we have tried doezns of recipes in the past. We will never need another one after finding this. I bought 6 briskets for our St. Patty's party and there wasn't a scrap left! I was thinking I would have lots of leftovers for sandwiches in the coming week but are guests scarfed it all up in no time. This recipe is THE BEST EVER.

Absolutely delicious!  I made this in my slow cooker - 2 hours on high and 5 hours on low.  The beer and spices really add a lot of flavor, and it turned out fork tender.  Thanks Susan for the recipe!

I too used the crock pot method.  Due to a smaller crock pot, I used one 3.5 lb brisket and halved the other ingredients as suggested by others.  (I used 2 1/2 T pre-minced garlic as that was all I had on hand.) I cooked it on high for 9 hours and it was PHENOMINAL!!!!  I'm actually considering buying another crock pot so I can make 2 at once and have enough for the whole family to have leftovers instead of just one of us!  This is the ONLY way I will be preparing Corned Beef Brisket from now on.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

I joined All Recipe just so I could rate this fantastic dish. My friend is a meber and she gave it to me and told me about this sight. My family was exstatic over this corned beef and they are a tuff crowd to please. I wish I would of made more because it went to fast. We will never need another corned beef recipe again.

This makes perfect corn beef. I use flat cut corn beef-make sure you cook it with the fat side on the top, I cook it in newcastle on low for 8 hours, it is so good. I will never pay deli prices again, you can get several sandwiches for the price of one at a deli with this recipe, and it couldn't be easier!

Very good but I only used one 3.8 lb brisket and I was late getting home from work so it cooked for almost 12 hours in my cockpot.  Will follow the recipe to the letter next time.

Use at least 2 pieces of meat.  Meat shrinks.  One makes 4-5 sandwiches.

I did this today and left it in the slow cooker for about 9 hours. I did not have the seasoning packet that some seem to have, so I used a little garlic salt, all purpose seasoning and pepper. It was delicious and my husband loved it..and he's not a huge corned beef fan.

Awesome!!!

I wish I could give you more than 5 stars.  This is the most delicious corned beef recipe I've ever tasted.  I made sandwiches, but I look forward to using this recipe and adding cabbage, carrots, onions, celery and potatoes in the winter and turning it into a wonderful boiled dinner.  Thank you so much, and I'll be trying some of your other recipes!

I had my doubts looking at the ingredients, but I followed the recipe (except for cutting it in half) and it was one of the best corned beefs I ever made!  Very tender, tasty... absolutely perfect.  Will definitely use this recipe next time I make corned beef.

My sister told me about this recipe and insisted I try it the next time I make corned beef.  I am so GLAD I did.  it was the best tasting and tenderest corned beef I've ever made (and my hubby insists on it once a month) and my family was raving.  Next time I will double the recipe because there weren't any levtovers.

This was great!  No fuss, easy prep with a few on hand ingredients and a brisket that I managed to get on sale.  Set it up before work today and got to come home to an hearty meal that everyone enjoyed.  Served it with fresh-made bread, sauerkraut, improvised Russian dressing and salad.  I will definitely be making this again!  :)

I love this recipe.  I take 2 slices of rye bread, toast it lightly. Spread one slice  of toast with butter, on the other  slice I put some thousand island dressing and then place a slice of Swiss cheese on top, and pop that side back in toaster  oven to slightly melt the cheese.  Once melted  I top the cheese toast with the corned beef, put some sauerkraut and then top with the buttered slice of toast.  Everyone loves it and it couldn't be easier!

I've been making corned beef for years and came across this recipe. Look no further! This is the one! I usually make it in the slow cooker and was hesitant to boil it on the stovetop but figured it was worth a try anyway. I'm so glad I tried it! I followed the recipe, except I halved it, as I only had one brisket. I cooked it in my Dutch oven, but had to weigh the brisket down with ramekins because it kept floating to the surface. I cooked a 4lb brisket for about 5 hours and it was very tender. So much better than any slow cooker recipe I've tried! I made it into sandwiches, which were delicious. A 4lb brisket would make about 4-5 generously piled sandwiches. Try this recipe!

I made this March 19th 2017, we had corn beef sandwiches for dinner.  This came out like butter!!! Once cooked I let it cool off then put it in frig wrapped in foil, sliced it in the evening with electric knife.  Next day hubby was still talking about how delicious it came out! I cooked it overnight on low for 10hrs, added 12oz porter, only made one brisket BIG BIG mistaken should have made at least three. I followed the rest of the recipe. Thank you for sharing an absolute awesome recipe, I'll be making it often!!!

I made mine in a Cuisinart electric pressure cooker.  90 minutes for a 4 1/2 pound corned beef.  A stove top pressure cooker would probably take  about 10 minutes less as the PSI is usually higher.  I've also made this recipe on the stove (regular pot) and in a crockpot depending on what my time limits were and what equipment I had on hand.  It's always GREAT.   So use this recipe and the cooking technique that works for you.

Why mess with the rest, when you can mess with the BEST?  Tomorrow will be my 5th time making this.  It comes out perfect every time.  Mine goes into the crockpot on low for 10 hours, as others have suggested.  When it's done, I used a spoon to scrape off the fat.   I also use the cooking juices to boil potatoes, cabbage, onion and carrots.  I highly recommend making the slurry as others have also suggested.  I serve rye bread with this, but everyone uses the bread to dip  into the slurry.  We eat this more "stew style"  than for sandwiches.  Another reviewer suggested rolling the corned beef into tortillas - great idea.  Pair with some friend potatoes and you have yourself and amazing breakfast/lunch/lunch.

Perfection.  I've made it 5 years in a row for St. Paddy's Day and everybody raves.  Always use my slow cooker instead of stovetop.  Always use Guinness beer.  After it cools enough to handle shred it removing fat as I go.  My one addition:  I strain and defat the cooking liquid and add it back to the shredded meat for serving.

This recipe has become a St Pats day tradition in our home. Not being fans of cabbage we like to cook this in  a slow cooker with potatoes  and carrots.

Perfect recipe for corned beef. Why cook it in water when you can cook it it beer! I like to cook it in my slow cooker all day on low. I also like to cook it the day before then refrigerate overnight.... that way you can slice it super thin. I always use this recipe when making Rueben sandwiches!

This is THE way to make corned beef! We had never been real corned beef and cabbage fans. While the corned beef had a distinct flavor, there was always something missing.  NOT ANY MORE! This recipe filled in that gap.  I started exactly as described, but ended up cooking it for about 7 hours because it still felt a little tough after 5.  Otherwise no changes.  I added cabbage, potatoes, and carrots for the last 1.5 hours of cooking.  This made a great meal and the first corned beef and cabbage we really enjoyed. Used the leftover corned beef for Reuben sandwiches the next day, and they were delicious too!

Very Good! I did not have peppercorns so I used course ground pepper, I cooked it in the crock pot. I sliced it thin and served on rye bread with sauerkraut and pepper jack cheese. Everyone loved it, I will make it again. Thanks!

Note that the meat will shrink to about 1/3 the original size.  Use 25 oz Fosters in blue can and omit water.  8 hours on low in crock pot.  Yummy!

I followed creative cooks' suggestions with this. It's now our st. Paddy's day annual meal.  Superb!!
"
I made the corned beef (using Guinness) exactly as written and cooked it for 6 hours on the stove top. I then removed the meat (which fell apart) and added 3 pounds quartered new potatoes, 2 pounds baby carrots (cut in half) and an onion. I let that cook for 20 minutes and then added a head of cabbage. I cooked an additional 15 minutes. Then I removed the veggies and made a gravy out of the leftover stock using a slurry of stock and corn starch. This recipe was a huge hit last night for our St. Patrick's Day get together. Very authentic tasting and the peppercorns get soft as they cook, so when you bite into one, you get a nice kick without being overly powerful or chipping your teeth. This will be our annual tradition!"

Our goto crock pot corned beef recipe.  Great traditional corned beef.  I wouldn't say it's tough, but I'd say it's firm enough not to shred when you cut it.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday. He is A  HUGE Reuben fan so I had to meet his high expectations. Let's just say that he absolutely LOVED this recipe. He said it was the best corned beef he has ever had.

Now, for those of you who are unsure of whether or not to trust this recipe, PLEASE trust it. I did everything it told me to do. I used the 1/4 cup of whole pepper corn, the 2 (12 oz) bottles of beer, and the entire clove of garlic. I was extremely nervous that the ingredients would be too overpowering but it was just absolutely fantastic. I used my slow cooker as well. I put the whole garlic on the bottom, placed the corned beef on top, and then poured the spice packet, the pepper corns, and the beer over the corned beef and cooked it on low for 10 hours. I cannot explain how flavorful it was.

FYI as a small tip. Take the corned beef out of the slow cooker BEFORE you pull it. I started to pull it apart in the slow cooker so I had to go and pluck out every single pepper corn because it got mixed in with the beef haha! I also used yuengling as the beer by the way! Leftovers were also incredible. Not too sure what one of the reviewers was saying about the leftovers not being good because I did not have that problem at all.

I made it!  I only made one brisket and adjusted the directions for one instead of 2.  I slow cooked for 7 hours, when done (tender) I removed the meat from the juices, shredded it on a chopping board, piled it high on an onion roll added a nice vinaigrette slaw, swiss cheese and honey mustard.  

I'm giving 4 stars only because the next time I make it, I will add pickling spice to the recipe.  We tend to like a little more flavor around here.  Other than that 


It was a HIT!

I used a slow cooker and could not fit both pieces of meat in one. The only beer I had was Blue Moon and used a dried outrageously garlic seasoning from Two Sisters Gourmet. Slow cooked for 8 hours, removed and let rest. We sliced the meat and made Reuben Sandwich l l.   Delicious!

I used a prepackaged corned beef portion from Fred Meyer. It did not come with packets. Followed recipe sans peppercorns and beer. The covering with water method makes this meat SUPER tender. Great for sandwiches. HOWEVER….severe lack of flavor. Would be better cooked in beef stock or broth. Was very tender but no flavor.

I've made this recipe several times. I love the flavor and the simplicity. I recently made it with Ginger Beer because it was the only beer I had left from a party. Wow...that added a whole new flavor dimension to the corned beef. It was amazing! I will make it with Ginger Beer from now on.

This is an easy, and tasty recipe. Just follow directions. If you only buy one piece of meat, you'll still need 2cans of beer. 
I served my corn beef with stir fry cabbage, and a baked potato.
Enjoy!

For the first time ever, I made corned beef for St. Patrick's Day; I tried this recipe, oven-roast potatoes, and sauteed cabbage. The only component I did not care for was the corned beef. I will never try it again. It was like boiled bacon.

Fantastic.  Cooked in the slow cooker on low for 9 hours.  Only used one roast and half the other ingrediants and it barely fit in my 3qt crockpot.  The roast came out melt in your mouth good.  Served up on lightly toasted kaiser rolls with lots of spicy brown mustard.

This came out AWESOME!  Even though I used Natural Light (afterall, it's 'the beer with a taste for food') this was a huge hit!  Yummy!

This is an easy and great way to make corned beef.  We used a 2.8 lb flat cut brisket.  I rubbed the meat with the spice packet, some brown sugar, the peppercorns, and garlic.  The beer and bay leaves added a nice flavor as well.  Poured in the beer and lots of water to cover.  Let it simmer for about 5-5.5 hours.  Added some carrots, cabbage, and potatoes with about an hour left.  Meat was tender and tasty.

I simmered two briskets in a slow cooker on low for nearly ten hours and the meat was so tender it was almost impossible to slice without falling apart! The leftovers (and I can't believe I had any) sliced easily once chilled. I personally felt the beer flavor was overwhelming, so about halfway through cooking I bailed out half the beer/juice and replaced it with very hot water. I'll try one beer (or none, or one not as strong as Guinness) next time. However, if you're a fan of that rich beer flavor, go for it. Those of you who complained that this recipe was bland should go to a doctor and have your tastebuds examined. Definitely worth trying!

This was amazing! I made it for my boyfriend, and I snuck a little piece just to try it. Usually I dont like corned beef at all. Well, tonight I went back for seconds! I cooked mine in beer with some extra chicken stock to cover it. I tossed it into the crockpot on low for 10 hours while I was at work, then strained the broth to boil potatoes and cabbage on the stove. Awesome! This recipe was great and has now become my go-to corned beef recipe!!!

Followed recipe exactly and would give this a 5 star rating but taste wasn't as much as we would have liked. I think the 2nd spice pack would have helped it a lot. Will look over reviews and make again. Also- 2 (3 pound) corned beef briskets was quite a bit. Could easily get by with 1 or 1 1/2 of them. Put extra 1/2 in freezer for next time.

The meat was amazing.  I used Guiness and followed the directions to the letter.  The only thing i wasnt a fan of was the cabbage cooked in the beer....made it sooo bitter.  Next time i will cook the veggies separately. Otherwise fantastic!

Great recipe.  Threw it in the slow cooker as others mentioned, which yielded some of the beer taste not burning off, so it was stronger in flavor than expected, but I think that's because I used a good flavored stronger beer (Newcastle), so it was my fault for changing the recipe.  Great though!

Excellent! When I make this the family can't get enough of it! The only difference is that I use 1 can of beer for 2 of them and I put it all together in the crock pot in the morning and it's done at dinner time. Thanks!

We loved this!  Made it just as directed (except halved) and added sauerkraut on rye.  I wasn't a huge fan of the rye (but I'm typically not) so I'll try it on something else next time, but the meat was perfect!

This taste just like the corned beef I long for from the deli's in Detroit and New York. The best corned beef recipe I've ever made or tasted! I used a slowcooker and let it go over night.

I have never made corned beef before.  My entire family LOVED it.  I used a crock pot, like previous reviewers mentioned, for 10 hours.  It was great to come home and have dinner done.  We'll be eatting corned beef more often- it was super easy and very tasty.

Most Excellent! Served on St. Paddy's day ... made 2 4 lb briskets which turned out not to be enough for 15 people because they kept coming back for more! Suggest putting peppercorns in a cheesecloth or strain before reusing broth as mine did not get soft and nearly I bit down on a hard one (maybe they were too old to start?!?) Also used leftover broth to cook carrots, onions and tatties as another reviewer suggested. Have already been asked by others for this recipe ... they easily replicated and love it!

Everyone loved this.  Just make sure you don't add any salt.  Cornbeef does that for you naturally.  I would serve some rolls with it.  Very filling.

I loved this. I added whole peeled potatoes in the 8th hour, and doubled the garlic. I also added one whole onion uncut; just leave the root intact to keep it from falling apart.

This was my first time ever trying corned beef in any form. I ate my portion and thoroughly enjoyed it. I cooked my veggies (1 onion, 6 potatoes, 2 carrots, 1 head cabbage) in there (adding all the veg but the cabbage 1 hour before, cabbage 30 mins before removing from heat--all overdone, for future reference). This lent an interesting dilemma: What do I do about the missing bay leaves and peppercorns?? Well, in case you were wondering--peppercorns become soft enough to chew up and eat. You need to really like black pepper. Which we do, so that was ok. The bay leaves...we haven't found yet...but there's always tomorrow :=) 5 stars, this worked exactly as advertised. Thanks for the recipe! ...I have one more thing to say. If you hate beer, don't use it. But if you like beer, go for it. The stronger the beer, the better, as its flavor remains in the finished product. I used O'hara's stout.

This is above and beyond the MOST spectacular way to eat corned beef ever!  We ate it as a roast with carrots and potatoes.  AMAZING!  I'll never use another recipe again.   I've called around to other family members (we live in different parts of the country) and theirs we're all made differently; none has yet to give such rave reviews. Glad I got this one!  Thanks so much

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I cut it in half (just two of us) and put everything in the crockpot.  I've come to the conclusion that I just don't care much for corned beef, so the 4-star rating is from DH.  He liked it but thought it could've been more flavorful.  In addition to the beer, I added water to the crockpot to cover the roast, but I would probably add beef broth if I made this again to boost the flavor.

I can't stop eating it.  Only change I made was due to laziness.  I didn't have the patience to peel all that garlic so I cut the top 1/3 off the bulb and tossed it skin and all into the pot.  It's a keeper.

This was the first time I have ever cooked corned beef and it was fabulous! So simple.  I did use only half the garlic bulb because it was large and a whole seemed like way too much. Cooked on low in the crockpot for about 8 hours. Served it at a party of 20 and there was none left!

I, too, used the Crock Pot, and it was wonderful ( I halved the recipe). It reminded me of how my mother's brisket tasted. I think she used a pressure cooker, though. We had it as a meal one night, and for Reubens the next! Yum, yum.

This is fantastic! It has been our St Patrick's day recipe for the past 2 years and ALWAYS gets rave reviews. I follow the recipe exactly and cook it overnight in the crockpot. There are rarely any leftovers. If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!

This was pretty tasty, and the meat really goes a long way.  I will be having sandwiches for the next couple of days.  The only change I made was to cook my in my slow cooker, rather than on the stove.  Left it simmering all day and it was lovely and tender when I got home. Going to go make myself another sandwich now!

Discard cooking liquid. DISCARD COOKING LIQUID?  For heaven's sake SAVE cooking liquid.  Chill it, remove the fat, and use it as a base for everything from gravies to soups; it is GOLDEN. Low and slow is the rule of thumb for brisket, with onions, garlic, and hot peppers.

I tried corned Beef in Beer I used a bottle of Guinesses.I tested it out on some deli style corned beef.The Corned Beef flavor wasn't as flavored as I like that meat to be.After adding the meat to the beer in boiling water.The corned beef had no taste.I didn't want to waste a hole Brisket.I dont really see how this recipe could be good.I will not attempt this again.

After reading some reviews since it got 5 stars I decided to try it. I am giving it 4* because I am not a corn beef person but when I made it, my fiancee was raving and savoring it the whole time during dinner. He even said that I  cooked it better than his mother :-). I only used 1 beer instead of 2 for a 5 1/2 lb meat. And added Onion but would skip it next time.

Made this over the weekend for a "football Sunday" dinner. It was fabulous. Everyone commented on the wonderful aroma and we all couldn't stop eating it.  Served on rye with creamy mustard, and a NY deli style (vinegar-based no mayo) cole slaw. Mouth is watering again!

This recipe is AMAZING!! I did it in the crock pot after reading all the reviews. UNBELIEVABLE how delicious it was with so few ingredients.  I did it more out of curiosity and I will do it over and over.  Thanks for this one!

So much more flavorful than cooking in water! I cooked one brisket in the crock pot on high 6 hrs. The final hour I added a bag of saurkraut and removed the meat. It was firm to slice. Made the best Reuben sandwiches ever - for me - on rye bread w/ cole slaw, saurkraut, melted swiss cheese and 1000 island dressing made from chili sauce and mayo. Huge hit during the football game. Thanks!

Wonderful Recipe. I made the corned beef in the crockpot, then took out and sliced it thin. When I topped the buttered bread with corned beef,saurkraut(Spelling is off I know)and swiss cheese, I baked it and then flipped it over with a pan the same size, so both sides would be browned. WOW, Did this get rave reviews? YES OH YES. Will make again soon. Great for a big croud.

This turned out wonderful.  Started off on the stove simmering for a couple of hours then transferred to my crock pot on high for an additional 4 hours.  I did use pickling spice, as my corned beef did not come with seasoning packets. Pickling spice includes chopped bay leaf, so did not add bay leaves.  The meat was extremely tender and flavorful.  Highly reccommend

I've made this several times now, no alterations...perfection.  I do strongly recommend using the liquid for carrots, potatoes, cabbage etc. while you let the meat rest a bit.  Others in our family who *thought* they didn't like corned beef have definitely changed their minds!  And we always wish we had made more!

I followed this recipe as best I could. My corned beef did not come with a seasoning packet, so I used pickling spice as another reviewer had done. I also used my slow cooker.  I loved it. My DH said it was okay but he liked my way of cooking corned beef (pressure cooker) better and he said it had a strong bay leaf taste that he could have done without. I like the slow cooker method, saves me alot of work and I love spices so everything tasted great to me. 5 stars from me. I will make this again and use only one bayleaf next time.

This was so great and so simple.  We love corned beef but I always covered mine with water and the seasoning packet.  This was by far soooo much better.  My husband LOVED it and told me it was the best corned beef he's eaten:)  Thanks.

WOW!! I only had one 3 lb. brisket (unfortunately) so I halved the ingredients. Also, I used miller lite beer since that's all my hubby had! Followed everything else exactly and cooked in crock pot for six hours before adding cabbage and then cooked it until done. The beer, bay leaf and minced garlic really add another dimension of flavor to an already wonderful dish! This is SO yummy, I think I could eat the whole thing by myself!! :o) I'll never use another recipe for corned beef. Thanks so much!

This was so good  my husband thought it was the best corned beef he ever ate.  I cooked in the crock pot  1 hour on high and then 9 hours on low.  I made sandwiches on marble rye with thousand island dressing and alittle sauerkraut.

I bought uncooked corned beef with spices and boil it for 6-8 hours then followed the recipe exactly. I had the beef with rye bread grilled with butter, it was the best corned beef sandwich i ever had.

This was awesome, i used 2 12oz bottles of light beer. I quartered an onion and threw that in there too. I didnt boil it, i put it in a crock pot for 12 hours on LOW. than i took out the corned beef and cooked my small red potatoes in there for 1 1/2 hrs. The only problem was all the fat on my brisket, there was a ton. This isnt anyones fault but my own, i didnt trim it which was stupid of me. So if your gonna make this get a not so fatty brisket and trim any fat!!! But the flavor was great!

Sooooo delicious, best ever. Admittedly this was the first time I made corned beef for myself so I don't have much else to compare it to, but I know I won't ever look for another recipe. I did use both spice packs, but it would probably be flavorful enough with one. I also used three tablespoons full of jarred minced garlic instead of the whole cloves, which didn't harm the recipe any. The beer I used was Guiness. I was gone all day and came home to  perfection - thanks so much for sharing!

Very good.  Easy straightforward recipe, excellent results.  We used 1 brisket instead of two and divided everything in half except cook time, turned out perfectly.  Thanks for sharing!

Yes! This recipe for corned beef is excellent. I tried it for St. Patrick's Day, and it was a hit. I found some horseradish mustard at the store, used seedless rye bread, and piled on the corned beef. Absolutely yummy!

This was excellent.  I read a few reviews and elected to use a crock pot.  The only change was I layered sliced onions on the bottom of the crock pot as a rack for the meat.  I cooked it over night for 9 hours on low, chilled it the next morning and sliced it after work for sandwiches.  I made Reubens and followed the suggestion of coleslaw on some of the sandwiches for something different.  It was a hit.  I also added the carmelized onions that had cooked with the meat.  I also noted that the corn beef was not as salty as I have made in the past.  I agree that you do not have to look any further for a corn beef recipe.  This is the best!

So good. I put it in the crock pot at 6am and we headed off to the city for the big St. Patrick's day parade. When we got home at 4:30 it was still a lttle under done, so I turned it up to high for another hour and 1/2. I boiled new red potatoes on the stove in the broth and also made the Fried cabbage recipe from this web sight using more of the broth instead of the chic. broth called for in that recipe. It was really good. The only thing I will do differently next time is strain the broth to get the peppercorns out. They were not good in the cabbage. Even my pickiest eater agrees we have a new tradition!

Wow! This was my first time trying corned beef as it wasn't something my mom ever made, but I loved it! So easy and flavorful. I had a problem with space - two briskets in a dutch oven is almost too much. Had a few small spills. Water didn't cover the brisket as directed but came out just fine. I boiled cabbage, red potatoes, and carrots in the dutch oven after I took the brisket out and it imparted a great flavor on the veggies. All around delicious!

This corned beef came out great!  I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 9 hours.  I wanted to use the cooking liquid to cook the vegetables, but as is, it was a bit harsh.  So I de-fatted and strained the liquid, added about 3 cups of water and around 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  And threw in a packet of Sazon just for kicks.  This tamed the liquid quite nicely, and it make the carrots, onions, potatoes and cabbage taste great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Phenomenal!  The best corned beef that I have ever had.  Cooked in a crock pot for about 10 hours and was as tender as could be.  Cooked potatoes underneath for an added little kick.  Had tons of flavor and will be cooking again soon.

This was awesome!  I only made one 3lb brisket and it was enough to feed my husband, myself and my 2 yr old son with leftovers - it wouldn't have been enough for 4 adults.  I will keep this one handy - most flavorful corned beef I've ever had.

I've never made corned beef before and this rocked my socks off!  It literally took me five minutes to throw everything in the crock-pot and by the time I got home, my house smelled fantastic.  I used a can of domestic beer, but I want to try other beers to see how they affect the flavor.  Thanks for my staple corned beef recipe - now March 17 won't be the only day I eat corned beef!

My oh my! I haven't seen my family eat like this before.  This is an amazing recipe.  Followed instructions as written using Guiness beer, but put in the crockpot for 10 hours. There are only 4 of us, but those two roasts that were over 3 lbs each are gone... totally gone.  Granted three of our number are pretty healthy sized guys and of that two are still in their teens, but I honestly thought there would be some left for sandwiches today.  When I make this again I will do three at a time and hopefully then some will be left over.

I am reviewing this item for my son, who grew up in the suburbs of NYC and moved to Atlanta.  One of the foods he missess dearly is a good NYC deli corned beef sandwich.  I came upon this recipe and emailed it to him.  He made it the very next day and called me to tell me it is by far the best corned beef he has ever had.  He made it again and brought it to work.  It was a gigantic hit.  Just a little note:  He used Guiness for the beer.

Perfect! I also used 1 can of chicken broth to cover the meat. I didn't have whole garlic, so I used 2 tbsp of minced garlic that I bought in bulk.  I cut the potatoes into thirds and put the baby carrots and the potatoes 3 hours before the beef was done, and they turned out perfect! Thank you for the recipe and thank everyone on their reviews.  It helps a lot!

I just made this sandwich for supper tonight and it was a good one and my dad really seemed to like it.I didn't care for it. I followed everything to a 't' (except for the beer,didn't have it) and put it on sourdough bread,I don't think I'll be in a hurry to make this one again. Thanks.

I was expecting this to knock my socks off, and it just didn't.  Pretty typical taste & it certainly wasn't falling apart after 10 hours in the crock pot.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was good but didn't deserve such rave reviews.

This recipe is so incredibly simple you'd have to TRY to screw it up.  I used Smithwick's beer (an ale made by Guinness), and I have never in my LIFE had better corned beef.  I'm now very happily spoiled, and so is my boyfriend. :)

I made this for a St. Patrick's day party- when I took it out of the crock pot (I took another reviewers suggestion- I also used Guinness for the beer) I thought it was a little dry. I put it out on the table for my guest and it was gone in no time- everyone loved it- it was gone soo fast my boyfriend didn't even have time to try some. Great recipe!

Excellent corned beef recipe. Put everything in a slow cooker and left in for about 10 hours - turned out so tender that we could barely slice it. Used Tecate beer, (we may use something darker next time), but it was still awesome. I also may use some ground pepper along with the peppercorns just so the pepper flavor isn't "all or nothing", but this will definitely be a repeat for my family.

Best corned beef I've ever had. I left it in the crockpot and was late getting home so it was pretty overcooked but it was still great. This is the way I will be making corned beef from now on.

Very easy and delicious recipe.  I wanted to cook in croc so this recipe seemed to be what would work best.  I cooked on low for 10-11 hours and it was very good.  Probably could have switched it to high for the last hour or so.  Will save recipe for next year.  I did add the packet of seasoning the meat came with and also added in a few extra peppercorns.  Great for leftover sandwiches.

I followed the recipe but took previous reviewers' advice and cooked it in the slow cooker for 9 hours rather than on the stove top. The beef had a good taste, but for whatever reason the meat was still somewhat tough. Next time I do this I'll let it cook for 12 hours. I used the cooking liquid to boil some potatoes, carrots, and cabbage on the stove top after cooking the meat, and that was very good.

A true 5-star rating! Everyone raved. A definite repeat, and worth the trip for the (cough) beer. I used a "light" variety, and I couldn't taste its presence at all. To cook, I was pressed for time, so I cooked in the pressure cooker one hour, and simmered in a pot 
1 1/2 hours. It was perfect, and yes, yes, unbelieveable on crusty bread with swiss and coleslaw!

Why can't there be more stars? This recipe most certainly deserves 10 stars. My family love corned beef but I don't make it often because we eat one meal and then I have leftovers to deal with. Not one speck was left of this recipe, and my teenaged son is already asking when I'll be making this again. I made the recipe exactly as stated, even though I had some reservations about the amount of garlic.  It came out perfectly tender, moist, and delicious. I strained the juices into a pot and added water to make a half/half mixture, and cooked up the carrots, turnips, potatoes, and cabbage that we traditionally eat with our corned beef. The juices imparted a wonderful flavour to the vegetables, although I do think it might have been too strong if I hadn't added water. This recipe will hold a place of honour in my recipe box.

I did read the reviews before posting my own.  To the woman who said she had to throw away her meat: you must have gotten a very bad cut of meat, or your crockpot wasn't working properly. There is no way a piece of meat could be immersed in liquid and cook for 10 hours without becoming tenderised enough to attempt eating.

This was delicious!  I have a 4 quart crock pot, so halved all of the ingredients and used one corned beef (and the whole seasoning packet).  Cooked it on high for about 8 hours.  I'm not sure how much difference the garlic and beer made since I haven't had corned beef very often, but cooked this way the meat was incredibly tender and flavorful.

Let me start by saying I have never made corned beef before.  They only corned beef I've had is from the deli on reubens.  This recipe is very easy.. I think it is very tasty but very salty. I know the recipe does not call for salt so I have decided it was the seasoning packet included or it is the nature of this meat. ...I loved my veggies cooked in the liquid from the meat.

I have really been lucking out lately!  This is yet another keeper!!! I made this today for dinner.  I cooked this in a crockpot for 10 hours on low. It came out extremely tender. I only had a 16 oz beer so I mixed some beef boullion with a cup of warm water and added that.  I only used 1/8 c of pepper corns.  And I used about 2 tsp of already minced garlic.  The taste was UNbelievable.  Next time I won't use the beef boullion because it was just a tad too salty, but still GOOD!  I added some of the "au jus" (strained) with the cabbage in a pot and boiled it, this gave the cabbage TONS of flavor! Served with new potatoes.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was awesome.  Had the in-laws over for dinner and everyone raved about this.  Even the 5 year old had seconds.  I made this in the crock pot, high for two hours and low for approx. 6 hours. Used slightly less than a 1/4 cup peppercorns because I ran out.  Also cooked potatoes and carrots in the bottom of the crock pot, they came out a little salty but I don't blame the recipe for that.  I put some of the broth in a saucepan, diluted it with a little water and cooked my cabbage in that. Will definitely make again. Served Luck 'O The Irish Brownies for dessert.

Just made this for a St. Pat's party.  Everybody said it was the best corned beef ever...not dry or salty.  I started with good corned beef from Fresh Market and followed the directions (except didn't have the peppercorns). I slow cooked it for about 9 hrs; threw in baby carrots the last 90 minutes...they turned out perfectly tasty as well!  The meat was so tender it was falling apart.  Served it with Diane's colcannon (also on this site and wonderful:-)  This was only my second time making corned beef and it was so easy and needed so little prep or maintenance...just throw it in the pot, walk away, and then serve the best corned beef.

Yum yum yum! Tried a different recipe last year and was just not happy. Had it tonight with buns, mustard and coleslaw and it was just what this german girl wanted for St. Paddy's day. Glad I didn't halve the recipe-- I want all the leftovers for corned beef hash in the morning.

I singed up for this site just so I could get this recipe after my sis-in-law made it for us last week (thank you soooo much Izzy). I had to pester her to find out how she made this succulent dish. This is going to be our dinner tonight and sandwich's the rest of the week. I put this together exactly as it says and I'll decide if I want to chance anything after this. Since Iz doesn't make changes I don't think I'll have to.

I had never had corned beef before. To start with, the two briskets did not fit in the crockpot with enough room for 1" water. However, they cooked just fine. My husband thought it was good, but I don't think corned beef is my thing. It just had very little flavor.

I made two corned beefs in two crocks pots.  One I used two bottles of guiness and the other two miller lites.  Both were very delicious.  I did not add water to the crocks, only a little of the meat was out of the liquid.  Only used the spice packets that came with the meat.  The corned beef were the point cut, which I prefer.

I've actually made this many times.  This is my family's favorite.  The closest recipe we have found so far to my late father-in-law's recipe for corned beef that he used to make for several Jewish delicatessens.  Yum!  I usually cook 3-4 3 lb corned beef briskets at one time.  They go very fast!

Even this non-cook found this recipe to be simple, easy and delicious. As a previous reviewer said: "remember to cut against the grain." (TY) Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!! This will be my go to for corned beef in the future. I did about 8 hours on low in the crockpot and it was amazing!! Only problem (not a problem) was I never got around to slicing it for sandwiches because the meat was so tender it just fell apart. Definitely recommend!!

We boiled the brisket for 5 hours, trimmed the remaining fat and made what I call fake Reubens!! The meat was juicy and tender. We baked the sandwiches at 350 degrees after cutting meat to melt the Swiss cheese for total 8 minutes. Then we topped with Romain lettuce and fat free thousand island dressing. We used bake ham in the past for our fake Reubens but this brisket was amazing. We only used 3/4th garlic bulb though because I read a review on it. Left overs are great too. I think garlic bulbs vary in size, so don’t get the large types. Get the smaller if you’re worried about it. Ours was perfect. No brisket rinse is needed either, skip google.

I've made this many times and it is by far the best recipe for corned beef. The meat is very tender and the flavor is perfect. I will do this recipe and cook the cabbage, potatoes and carrots separately.  An absolute keeper!

I've stopped searching for the best way to prepare corned beef and will always use this recipe from now on.  The ingredients and method are really simple, so I don't know what creates such incredible flavor, but I couldn't stop nibbling at the corned beef nor sipping the cooking liquid once it was done.  I did add some beef stock base to the water which gave it extra richness, and I used an IPA for the beer.   All ingredients went in the slow cooker on low heat for about 10 hours, so it was incredibly easy as well.  Absolutely wonderful.

This was just okay for me.  The flavor from the cooking liquid was just a little funky for my tastes. Maybe too much garlic?  It wasn't *bad*, but just not my favorite for corned beef.  And while the meat shredded easy, it wasn't as tender as I thought it would be after such a long cooking time.

This sounds excellent, so want to make it.  I'm trying not to sound dumb, but when she says 2 (3 pound) corn beef briskets, does she mean 2 3-pound briskets equalling 6 pounds or 2 briskets that equal 3 pounds?

This recipe is awesome!  This is my third time making it...my corned beef is cooking in the crock pot as I type this review. 

To justdavid1953, the spice packet is simply pickling spice which, in the US, can be purchased in the spice aisle of any grocery store.  I didn't measure the amount in the seasoning pack but it looks to be about 1/2 tablespoon.

Everyone seemed to like this, as most of it was gobbled up the first time it was offered.  I dumped everything in the crock pot & left it on high for abt 7-8 hours & voila! Done.  I didn't try any-not my thing but it was a hit. Thanks for the recipe!

We only had one 3 lb roast and used 1 bottle of Heineken. We placed it in the crock pot on high until it boiled (a couple of hours) and then turned it on low for the next 5 hours. We shredded it, dumped out almost all the liquid (left enough to cover the meat) during the last hour. We really enjoyed it.

I made the recipe as is.  My crockpot only fit one brisket so I used the stove (covered and the lowest heat) for cooking and it turned out just the same.  I also experiemented with beers...I found that a bud light was ok, but guiness at a bit better flavor.  All in all....I love this recipe.  It will make you look good at a party or family gathering.

Using a Boyle's Corned Beef and 2 btls Bully Porter and rest of ingredients as noted, 8 hrs low -- the result was excellent!  A non-beer drinker -- I'll make this again - but with a lighter beer -- the Porter taste was just too strong for us.  I would certainly recommend this recipe and this method for cooking a corned beef.

My husband and I loved it.  I used the ingredients as listed but cooked it in a slow cooker for about 8-9 hours.  The meat was yummy and tender.  I will definitely make again, I've already added this recipe to my recipe box!

I am not a big fan of corned beef, but this was delicious! Cooked it in the slow cooker and it came out tender, garlicky (which is always good) and yummy!

This is the one for sandwiches!!  The meat was tender, juicy, easily sliced.  I'll never make less than 2 briskets again.  It was all eaten.

What a delicious recipe! I halved it and used Corona as the beer. I didn't have enough garlic so I added some garlic powder. This recipe is very forgiving and so easy!

GREAT recipe!  I didn't have guiness - they didn't have it at the store, but I'm not a big fan of a real stout beer, so I used Harp Lager - 2 bottles with a 4 lb corned beef in the crock pot.  Used water to top off the liquid.  I also put my potatoes, carrots and pearl onions in the meat just about 2 hours before it was done.  I simmered my cabbage for 5 minutes in some broth that I poured in a seperate pan.. it turned out PERFECT!  Great recipe and thanks for sharing it.

Wow. I normally do the whole boiling the corned beef on the stove top but this was SO much better. It had a ton of flavor and was so easy to make. I did have to add another beer to my slow cooker about halfway through but mines runs a little hot. Awesome recipe and I will be making it again! Thanks!!!!

This recipe hits a home run!  My husband ate it all and was begging for more.  I made another one the next day, and it was gone in no time.  The only change I made was giving it a 'bath' in ice water for about 30 minutes.  The first one was a little too salty for us, but the second one after the bath was perfect.  This recipe will definitely be used for many years to come!

I put it in the crock pot frozen. I only made one corned beef and I used one bottle of beer (on the wall.. in my head now) and I threw in a bunch of garlic and the seasoning packet and went to work. Hubby works from home and kept an eye on it. Started on high for about 4 hours, then turned it off about 3 hours later. I turned it back on to warm when I got home and served on bread for sandwiches with some Swiss cheese. Supreme-o. Was very salty on its own... I think that is the tendency of the meat. I froze the left overs for another time. GREAT recipe! TFP!

This was a really good and easy recipe. I followed it exactly except I cooked for about 8 hours on low in the crock pot. I made 2 in one large, oval crock pot and and 1 more in a smaller round crock pot. Used Budweiser. It's a keeper.

This is a great recipe. If you are a first time corned beef cooker like myself, and don't like beer don't allow that to stop you from trying this recipe. The beer flavor compliments the corned beef in a way that it goes unnoticed. Don't worry the recipe is simple and the taste is what everyone else has said. Wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly, except I cooked it on low in a slow-cooker.

Awesome!! I have used this recipe twice now and it is great. Best corned beef I have had. I added potatoes and carrots in the last half hour of simmering and they came out very good. I then used some of the liquid to make a "gravy" for the vegetables. I added some flour to the liquid and poured it over the veggies. Thanks!!

I'm sure it's just me and my hubby but we didn't like this at all.  I'm not a huge corned beef fan to start with, but this was the worst I've ever tasted.  I halved the recipe but didn't change anything except leaving the bay leaves out because I didn't have any, but we ended up throwing the entire thing out.  However, don't take my opinion on this because, like I said, I'm not a fan to begin with.  Sorry.

I followed the recipe ingredients but cooked on Low in the slow cooker for 10 hours. I've never made corned beef, so I decided to experiment with a flat cut (medium fatty) and round cut (very lean). For sandwiches, the flat cut was definitely better tasting and more "luscious". It was as good as anything I've had in a deli.    I'll probably shred the round and use it in Corned Beef Hash Cakes, which is listed elsewhere, or good old hash-and-eggs.

Wow!  This is as good as it gets.  I cut the recipe in half, put it in the crock pot and came home to the most delicious corned beef.  This recipe was so flavorful.  I did add cabbage at the end of the cooking time and even the cabbage tasted better.  I was concerned that the flavors of garlic and peppercorn would be too overpowering, but it was perfect.

This is IT! I've made many other corned beef recipes and now have made this one on St. Patrick's day for 3 years in a row. I won't ever go back. We don't take alcohol, so I use ginger ale instead of beer....still tastes amazing. This isn't just for sandwiches. Use this recipe for your main dish Corned Beef!

I made this today adding onions, potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. I was really looking forward to having the leftovers in rueben sandwiches later this week, but there were NO LEFTOVERS!!  Everyone who stopped by today had some and we all agree: 5+++++ stars.
NOTE TO SELF:  Don't use Guiness (too strong), don't use Instant Pot ( use regular crockpot), don't use flat cut ( use point cut, better flavor)     3/17/19

I found some corned beef in the freezer and thought this would be a good way to revive it. Unfortunately I think I may have discovered I'm just not a corned beef fan (or maybe it had been in the freezer too long?), but I did still enjoy the flavor. It was a pretty strong smell coming from the pot but it balanced out well in the actual meat. Maybe I'll try it again someday with some fresher meat!

This is simply delish! I definitely recommend.  As another reviewer stated, use Guinness.  It gives the beef a very rich flavor which goes well with saurkraut, swiss, homemade thousand island dressing on rye..

Perfect! Followed recipe but cooked in slow cooker.  Used a local dark beer called Southern Pecan.  Took this to a pot-luck and party.  It was a big hit!  I cannot recommend this enough!

I thought it was good, but have never made a corned beef before to compare it to.  I tried it on a sandwich with brown mustard and thought it was good, but too rich.  I thought it was much better after it was refrigerated then put on Reuben sandwiches. Also, I didn't enjoy eating it without bread.

This was a great & easy recipe.  Highly recommended!  I overcooked the meat (let it go all day long in the slow cooker)  & it fell apart & melted in our mouths!

Delicious recipe 'as is'.  I actually did not make any changes to the recipe.  Sometimes I add cabbage and carrots at the end to have as a side with the corned beef.

I made the recipe as is.  I think it turned out really well.  The only thing I wish is that it would slice thin, but otherwise, it had really good flavor.  I made Grilled Corned Beef Sandwiches with Rye bread.

Oh... WOW! This is the first time I have made corned beef and I was amazed at how good this recipe is!  And I didn't even add garlic (didn't realize I was out!)  We had it the other night for dinner, and I'm already craving it again!  Wish I had QUADRUPLED the recipe!  Definitely adding this to the must-have for dinner rotation!

I thought this recipe was just okay.  I wasn't as crazy about it as everyone else is.  I really prefer pastrami to corned beef but bought corned beef to have around St. Patty's day.  I added the entire bulb of garlic and I'm not sure that it added any additional flavor, I could have just used 7 cloves and I think it would have imparted the same amount of flavor.  I'll probably try a different recipe next time.  Thanks for sharing !

well I gave this a shot.  In the end it was still pretty good.  I beleive it has excelelnt potential and more likely than not, it was my cooking of it that made it seem not as good as expected.  First off I read through the first 40 or so reviews to get ideas and tips from others also for those additions to enhance which are not part of the original recipe.  I ended up using a 5-quart oval shaped slow cooker.  Now always with a slow cooker I have the dilemma of how much liquid to add.  I spoke to a local butcher and he said since it would not be boiled in a pot first there was no need to submerge it under liquid, however there should be some in the slow cooker nonetheless.  I did by two briskits and only used one to try receipe out.  Added one 12 OZ bottle of guiness and a little water and it still covered the briskit.  also added included spice packet, half a bulb of cleaned and peeled garlic and half the peppercorons.  it still tasted prety good but I wish i owned a deli style slicer as that would have made it perfect instead of a roast beef style carving of the meat.

I've been making corned beef for many years and decided to try this after reading the reviews and knowing I wasn't going to be home all day.  This is the best ever!  We really loved it.

The flavor of this meat was great and super easy to make.  However, maybe it was just the meat that I got but it was extremely fatty and I had to shred it just to get all of the fat off.  Next time, because there will be a next time, I'll make sure I trim any fat that can be trimmed before cooking.

This was delicious. I have to admit, I was in a hurry and forgot the garlic, but it was still wonderful. I put it all in the crockpot and cooked it for 7 hours on low, then upped it to high for the last 3 hours. With 2 hours to go I threw in some peeled potatos and carrots. I added some cornstarch to the broth to make gravy at the end, and the entire family just gobbled this up. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for St. Patrick's day and am very glad I did.  We didn't make sandwiches, but I will next time.  My corned beef was moist, tender, and wonderful.  I served this with Dian's Colcanon and used the leftovers to make corned beef hash.  YUM!

UPDATE: THIS FREAKIN ROCKS!!! TONIGHT I USED MY NEW MEAT SLICER (CMAS GIFT FROM FUTURE IN-LAWS). THIN SLICED MEAT, TOPPED ON TOASTED RYE BREAD, BROILED TO MELT THE SWISS CHEESE & TOPPED W/ TI DRESSING/CREAMY COLESLAW (FROM GROCER'S DELI) MADE FOR A MOUTHWATERING (AND I MEAN A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!) SANDWICH. EVEN BETTER THAN I REMEMBER. :-) Good stuff! I thought this was going to be a total disaster though.... I placed a (3 lb.) brisket & everything else in my slow cooker (FYI - I needed to add ~ 2 c. worth of H2O to cover), turned it on low for 9 hr. & went about my day. At 3 PM, I plugged in my bread machine to make homemade rye bread (mmm...). Around 7:30 ("dinner time"), I checked my brisket and saw that my sc was off!!! Since it was still warm, I turned my sc back on low for an additional 5 hr. (I think it turned off when I plugged my bread machine in). I was home sick on St. Paddy's day, so my bf came to visit & we had our rubens then (but I was REALLY craving them on Sun...). Served piled high on the bread I made Sun. afternoon w/ a generous helping of homemade thousand island dressing, sauerkraut & swiss cheese. A brief broiling toasted our sand. to perfection! Served w/ kettle chips, Guiness beer & mint brownies, this was a very filling meal! Thx. for sharing :)

This was my first attempt at corned beef so I don't have anything else to compare this too.  We planned on Reubens for dinner and the only way I've made them in the past is buying the deli sliced corned beef.  This Was AWESOME.  Cooked in the the slow cooker - 6 hours on low and the last 2 on high.  Did one 3 lb brisket, but didn't reduce any of the other ingredients. It made about 7 nice sandwiches.  So good in fact, I went out and bought a 4 1/2 lb brisket to do again next weekend.

I'm giving this recipe five stars because I don't even like corned beef and I liked this recipe.  I made this for my Irish, corned beef-loving husband and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  I made the recipe as is and it was great.

Really enjoyed this.  I used 1/2 guiness and 1/2 harp for beer.  I cooked the beef for 8 hrs on the low setting for the crock pot.  It was absolutely tender and the sauce was fabulous!

Used all the rest of the ingredients but only used one roast, because it was just my husband and I. Delish. Daughter #1 loved it. Daughter #2 gave up meat for lent but was thinking of backsliding for this dish.

My husband and the other guys at my recent party LOVED this recipe!  I used Guinness Beer which definitely added to the flavor more than most would have.  I also simmered it on my stove top for 8 hours, adding more garlic about halfway through.

I used one brisket and should have done two.  The family loved it, even my 5 year old.  Tastes like something you find at a New York deli.  Served on a Kaiser roll with swiss cheese and spicy mustard.  Will make again for great, deli-style corned beef sandwiches.

This was the best corned beef on a reuben. I used corona beer and slow cooked it as directed. I took some of the juices from the cooked meat to cook the saurkraut down and it turned out very yummy.

Delicious corned beef! I halved the recipe but wish I had made more so we would have had some leftover. I put everything in the crock pot, cooked it for 10 hours on low heat and it was great!

Came out pretty darned good. I used Miller Lite, as I'm not a fan of Guiness, and I won't make any food with wine or beer I wouldn't typically drink. I threw it all in my slow cooker and went downtown to celebrate St. Patty's day. When I got back my kitchen stunk to high heavens, but the corned beef was perfect. (as good as a jewish deli near me, and much less expensive)

Outstanding recipe. We have only had deli corned beef and this was my first time making it at home. We all agreed this was far better tasting and more tender than anything I have ever bought at the deli. My next experience will be using this recipe to make a full Irish meal of cabbage and potatoes cooked in the broth. Thank you very much.

I cooked two, one for home and one for work, in two separate crock pots.  In each crock, I used one 12oz can of beer (just random Anheuser Busch products), spice packets sprinkled on top, 5 spoonfuls of mince garlic, and a large onion sliced and placed on top and around roast.    I used a 3.5 lb flat cut corned brisket for work and cooked it on high for 2 hours then low for 10.  After taking it out and letting it rest tented in foil, it carved nicely, just falling apart as I cut, in that typical stringy type corned beef texture.  Coworkers raved about the taste.    Used a 3.5 lb corned round for home and wanted to cook it for 12 hours but my husband forgot about it so it cooked 18 hours on low. Took it out, rested in a foil tent, then carved it with a plastic knife.  It was THAT tender.  Juices just ran from it as I cut it.  The round held its shape, making it perfect for sandwiches, no stringiness at all.  The taste was wonderful!    so for those of you who hate the stringy texture, try a corned round.  A little more expensive but it doesn't shrink and holds its shape well.

I will never use another corned beef recipe again!!! I followed the recipe to a T except I used a slow cooker, and it was the best corned beef I ever had! I let the meat cook on low overnight (~10 hours). The Guinness really helped cut out some of the salt as well as add full bodied flavor to the meat. I just made it yesterday, and the brisket is almost gone between 3 people! On my way to buy another brisket now! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Make 2 - after the fat is trimmed, it's small (no leftovers)! Cooked in crock pot on high for 5 hours.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day yesterday and it was a huge hit!  We didn't make sandwiches, but sliced it up and had it with cabbage, potatoes and carrots.  Followed the recipe exactly, except did it in the crockpot (on high for about 2 hours, then low for about 6 hours).  I used Guinness Draught for the beer.  After the meat was done, poured the broth into a stock pot, added potatoes and carrots and a little more water, boiled for 20 mins, added cabbage (sliced into big chunks since the whole thing wouldn't fit), cooked about another 20 minutes and everything came out perfectly!  Made the "Irish Soda Bread" recipe on this site to go with it, which also turned out great.  Oh---there were 6 adults here, and there were only enough leftovers for maybe 1 person (I'm glad we cooked 2 briskets instead of just 1)!

so good.I cooked it in the slow cooker and after 6 hours on high, I didn't need to slice it- it just fell apart.  Even my husband- who grumbled that he hates corned beef -enjoyed it.  very delicious recipe.

So yummy! I halved the recipe since I didn't want leftovers. Served it up on onion rolls that I made that day. Everyone raved about them! I've never made or had corned beef before, but this will be the recipe I keep for it.

This was fantastic! I made a half recipe of this last night and there are absolutely no leftovers! The seasoning was perfect (definitely not too much garlic), and the meat was incredibly tender. I used my slow cooker on low for about 9 or 10 hours. I'm thinking of buying more corned beef to make more!

This was great. The meat melted in our mouths. Don't skip the garlic or beer, it really made the dish. One brisket fed 5 of us with no leftovers, so suggest you make two if you want to make sandwiches.

WOW! What awesome flavor! I cooked mine all day on low in my crock pot. Used only one corned beef and added extra corned beef spices, peppercorns, garlic and 1 bottle of Newcastle beer. Which gave it a really good flavor. I think the darker the beer, the better! My hubby loved this. Better the next day on sandwiches!

Such an easy, great recipe! It tastes just like the corned beef that I've been trying to recreate from an Irish family friend (who wouldn't give me their recipe, by the way). I halved the recipe, but used the whole spice pack, and placed it all in the slow cooker on low. After 8 hours, I pulled it out (it wasn't falling apart) and added halved red potatoes and cabbage. Yum! It wasn't too salty, like a lot of corned beef usually is...and even though all I had on hand was Heineken, it still came out great, with only a subtle beer flavor!

This is awesome!  I used both spice packets and light beer.  I put it all in a crock pot, set it on low, 10-hours later it was perfectly done.  My 4-year-old couldn't keep her hands off the meat!

I made the corned beef (using Guinness) and followed the recipes except I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  OMG this was out of this world, melted in your mouth like butter.  I made sandwiches for the guys at work and they loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Fabulous recipe...way past 5 stars!!

Great for a Reuben Sandwich but I prefer the sweet taste of the Guinness Corned Beef recipe instead especially if you are serving it as the main dish and not sandwiched between bread in a Reuben. You can also modify the Guinness Corned Beef recipe and for the slow cooker; I did and LOVED it. This recipe is good but overall bland.

Corned beef is only good in beer! I love to make this recipe. I add a few shots of whiskey, pomegranate juice and may I suggest Guiness as the beer :)

Used recipe and cooked in a slow cooker for about eight hours. Very tender and easy to shred. Served as a deli sandwich with slaw, swiss cheese, meat, mustard and mayo and put on marbled rye. Good but better next day. Thanks.

This is the only corned beef recipe I will make for now on, Excellent!! We ate it with cabbage and colcannon on St. Patty's Day, used it on a rueben the next day, and on the third day I made corned beef hash, and we would have ate it a fourth day but it was all gone. It was that good!!

Fabulous! Made this in a crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours. Flat cut brisket is easier to slice for sandwiches. Used the reuben sandwich II recipe from this site. Loved it!!

We are not huge fans of corned beef, but we gobbled this up. Used the leftovers to make corned beef hash. Going to make a rueben dip with the leftover beef to serve at Easter

This recipe was amazing! I used both spice packets and beef broth instead of water. This is definitely a keeper.

Don't hesitate!!! Super tender and flavorful!!! Making corned beef for the first time I was nervous! I used a 4lb corned beef w/ seasoning packet, 1 bottle o' beer, 1/2 bulb of garlic cloves, 1 quartered yellow onion, celery, and filled the crock up the rest of the way w/ a bottle of water. Cooked for 9.5 hours and was so tender I could barley slice it. I served it with roasted potatoes and cabbage cooked separately. My partner thought this was the best corned beef ever, better than grandmas! Ha ha ha...Victory! Thanks SDK!!!

Excellent....the smells through out the house were great. Family really enjoyed this, even my 19 month old! I did half the recipe and only made one brisket. I also cooked this in the crockpot due to the fact that I had to work. I put my potatoes and carrots on the bottom of the crock, meat on top and added the rest of the spices,beer,water,garlic, etc. Cooked on low for 8 hours. I actually cooked my cabbage seperate on the stove and steamed it in several ladel fulls of the crockpot juices. When the cabbage was cooked and wilted I was able to fit it in the crockpot with the meat and veggies. Kept on warm and it was perfect. Will definately make this way again. Thanks!

I was a bit disappointed after all the glowing reviews. While this recipe was very easy to prepare it was definitely lacking in taste. I followed the recipe exactly as posted and it just missed the mark on taste. I think I will stay with my mom's old fashioned recipe of boiling the corned beef with cabbage, onions, carrots, and potatoes.

Best corned beef we've had ever. I only made one small flat cut brisket so halved all the ingridients. I added one can beef broth and simmered it in the crock pot on low all day. An hour before dinner I removed the meat to a casserole and poured the juices and broth into a dutch oven to cook some potatoes, carrots and cabbage.  We have very little leftovers so I'm going to look for more to cook for sandwiches.

Followed the recipe exactly,using a slow cooker,and received rave reviews from everyone. Cooked it eight hours, then after carefully removing the meat, I took
the juices and poured  it into a large pot, and cooked the potatoes and carots. 
along with an onionon top of the stove.
towards the end  of cooking I added the cabbage. It turned out fantastic. Thanks
so much for this recipe. This  recipe deserves more than five stars!

Not nearly as impressed as I feel like I should be with the glowing reviews, I liked the Corned beef and Cabbage II on this site much better. I guess I don't like the flavor the beer gives, maybe.

I hate to give this only 3 stars after all the glowing reviews. I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of putting it all in a crockpot for 8+ hours. Yes, it was very tender and the corned beef was good. But I put cabbage in with it and the cabbage was awful, very bitter. The recipe states you can use the leftover liquid for cabbage, but I would NOT recommend that at all. I thought maybe it was me, but my husband who LOVES cabbage didn't like it at all either. He said the corned beef was good, not great, but good and asked me to make my recipe I used last year for next year's New Year's Day meal and not use this one again. Oh well! I guess I was expecting more because of all the great reviews.

My husband adores Reubens and I love corned beef any old way.  This is the best I ever tasted.  Even from a deli!

This was very good. I'm not a huge corned beef fan, but I made this for a St. Patty's day party and my guest loved it.
