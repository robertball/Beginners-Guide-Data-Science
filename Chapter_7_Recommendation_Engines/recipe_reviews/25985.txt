I tried this cuz I wanted to use up some leftover brewed coffee (thanks allrecipes for your ingredient search section). Also I happened to have all the ingredients this recipe calls for.  I goofed following the directions since I was trying to hurry. I put the sugar in with the flour, etc. and I did not sift but stirred with a wire whisk. I'm glad it still came out good. Also in my oven it only needed to bake 30 min. Even then it looked a little dry, but it was very light, not at all dry on the inside. It cut beautifully. On my 1st bite of the warm cake, I thought it might need to be sweeter but I changed my mind as I finished eating it, after all I was enjoying it without icing.  I will make this again since it was good, easy and forgiving of my mistakes. Also I'm eager to try it with semi-sweet chocolate chips added!

Easy to mix up and the flavor is good. However, while I wouldn't go so far as to say the cake is dry, it isn't as moist a chocolate cake as it could or should be.  I used a half recipe, for cupcakes, and was very careful with the baking time so as not to overbake.  A good blob of "White Cake Frosting II" helped mitigate the dryness.

This cake was really great.  I used a bavarian cream filling and chocolate butter frosting.  It was a great hit at my family function.  I will be making this cake for years to come.  
Thank you, Julia

I made this for someone who has a milk allergy in the family and it was really good!  Moist and I didn't miss the milk!  I halved this recipe and made two 9 inch cakes.

This cake is awesome! I'm not a professional baker, but I bake on the side and I use this recipe for a base of a number of chocolate cake orders. I NEVER use the coffee in this recipe as I like the classic moist Devil's food cake taste. I just add hot water. The photo I submitted is actually this recipe made low sugar using the Splenda brand for baking called "Splenda Sugar", it is a blend of Splenda and sugar and is heavy like sugar. I'm a diabetic and it made for a FABULOUS 30th birthday cake for me--everyone swore up and down I bought it. But I used my own low sugar chocolate frosting recipe and paired with this cake was...Devil's food cake HEAVEN! I absolutely recommend this recipe! I make it all the time!

I've been looking for a milk-free chocolate cake recipe (my boyfriend is lactose intolerant) and I'm so glad I tried this one! The recipe is really easy and the cake is moist, fluffy, and very chocolaty. I halved the recipe for a trial batch and it made 18 cupcakes. I cooked them for about 18-20 minutes and they are delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I was thrilled to see this recipe as I had lost the one my mother gave to me.  She was baking this cake 60 years ago and so much better than other chocolate cakes.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this cake took forever to cook. When I thought it was done it wasn't. It was very dense and dark in color. Not going to try again.

This is so good and so easy!  It's not too sweet and it is extremely moist.  I was worried that it would dry out based on another review, but it was even more moist today than right after I made it yesterday.  Great recipe!

Amazing!!! I made this cake yesterday. I followed the recipe, but instead of flouring my 9x13 pan, i used sugar!! The cake came right up off of the pan. Also it added a sweetness to the edges! The kind that melts in your mouth!! I use sugar instead of flour for everything!

So yummy!  I used this recipe for my son's 2 yr. birthday party.  I followed the directions as is except for the coffee and used hot water instead.  I got so many compliments on it.  I will have to try it with the coffee when I'm not making it for a big crowd.  Will definately use this one again.

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it wasn't as rich or fudge as I like chocolate cake to be. That being said, it was very easy to make and I loved the addition of the coffee. I put it in a tube pan and had to increase the cooking time (I believe by 20 minutes), and topped it with Chocolate Pecan Praline Sauce from another site, which soaked in and made it so fabulous!

Made it in an 11x16 dark[enamelware] pan.

I made this cake to go with our dinner tonight. I made a bundt cake and sheet cake. I added a cream cheese & milk chocolate chip filling to both cakes. As soon as the cakes came out of the oven, I topped them with a glaze made of real butter, pure vanilla, sugar & evaporated milk. I then topped the bundt cake with a fresh blueberry sauce (off this site). Made a beautiful cake and all my guests raved. This is a wonderful recipe, especially when you have several to feed. Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe a little on the dry side. I think I'll add a packet of chocolate instant pudding next time to add a some moisture.

I halved the recipe, only wanting one layer. It'd be great if you had a really severely lactose intolerant kid, but other than that... well, we ate it about 4 hours after I'd baked it, and it tasted as though it had been sitting on the counter for a couple of days. Won't make it again.

Wow.  My milk/nut allergy 7 year old was thrilled to be able to eat such a delicious, moist cake for his birthday party. Parents & kids all enjoyed it and no one missed the dairy!!  I am making another one for my son's 100 day celebration in school!

I made it almost exactly as written.  I used instant espresso (1-1/2 tsp for 1 cup boiling water, plus another cup of just boiling water)  
The cake was VERY chocolatey, not too sweet and perfectly moist.  I would go ahead next time and use the full amount of coffee or instant espresso and see how that tasted.  
I made Martha Washington Chocolate Frosting as the cake was for a friend who is lactose intolerant.  It went over as a hit.

I doubled and made a 4 layer cake . The recipe said to use a rectangle pan but the photo was for a round cake - so I found that confusing . 
I copied the white chocolate dipped  strawberries on top - looked impressive!

It was pretty good, but when I took it out of the pan, it broke into a lot of little pieces. So I came up with a really cool idea: I took cookie cutters and I cut the pieces of cake into hearts and Mickey mouses and iced them. I called them CAKIES...isn't that adorable? You should try it!!!

This was a great recipe to try with a 9 year old, she was able to conquer all the steps and it was moist and gone in one night!  Beats any box cake too!  I even had all the ingredients in the cupboard!  Thanks for such an easy and tasty recipe!

Just finished making Chocolate Cake V and it is delightful!  I halved the recipe and I'd suggest a cooking time of approximately 35 minutes if you do this.  I also love how you add coffee to the cocoa in this recipe.  Never heard of that before with chocolate cake, brilliant!
