This recipe is fabulous!  I didn't have shortening so I used unsalted butter, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Very soft, with a crispy crust.  My husband couldn't stop telling me how good it was.  Thank you!

This is a VERY good bread recipe.  If you make a lot of home made bread or use yeast often, you can save a lot of money by buying it in bulk at natural food stores, or even at Sam's.  I think I paid about $7 for 2 lbs of yeast there, which would have cost close to $50 if I bought the single yeast packages instead. This recipe is excellent because the bread is flavorful, and you can add more salt or sugar if you prefer.  If you want the bread to be soft-crusted, I rub a little extra oil on the dough when I allow it to rise.  Also, I save a bit of money by using oil instead of shortening. Thanks for the great recipe, Sandra.  This bread with butter is unbelievably tasty! Mmmmm...!

This is a good recipe. The only change I made was to use 1 cup milk & 1 1/4 cup of water instead of all water. (I halved the recipe.)

This is by far the BEST recipe for bread I have found.  My kids LOVE it and it's so easy.  I cut the recipe in half because I cheat and let my mixer do all of the work with the dough hook attachment.  I also change the shortening to real butter.  Comes out perfect every time!  Thank you for this great recipe!!

I love this bread. I had made this with my 10 yr old son to teach him about yeast and the science behind it. It was easy to follow, and produced delicious results. We even cut the recipe in half. Thank you for a great recipe.

I halved the recipe because I only wanted a loaf or two.  I still needed about 7.5 cups of flour before the dough was thick enough to stop sticking to the sides of the bowl.  I only waited 45 minutes for the dough to rise and it seemed to be only enough dough for one loaf.  After 30 min in the cooker, it came out a little doughy.

The first time that I made bread from scratch.  Yeast always scares me.  I proofed it first and everything fell into place.  The texture was very nice.  Mild flavor. The house smelled divine. Made excellent apple bread pudding. I still looking for a recipe that used honey, but this was a start.

Very easy recipe.  I have never been good at making bread and this recipe was a success for me!  I did get lazy and only knead for 6 minutes and it was fine!  Will make again very soon!  Thanks!

I have been using this recipe for the past 3 months now, and has never disappointed my family! For a golden finish, I scramble an egg and brush it on the each loaf.

awesome bread, not so airy it has bubbles, which i hate about yeast breads. But the recipe is vague on the yeast process, u shouldnt dump the yeast into all that water, plus it needs a food item to activate. So just use half a cup warm water (110 degrees) and a tsp of sugar, add yeast and let it sit about 5 to 10 until very foamy, then add to the rest of the liquid. I also use mostly milk instead of water, softer crust!

Absolutely delicious bread recipe. I followed it as written, EXCEPT for a step in the beginning. My first batch failed because it didn't have a chance to "bloom." After adding the yeast, water, sugar and shortning it needs to rest for about 10 minutes to activate the yeast. I did this the second batch and it came out beautifully

I used the recipe for a English Presentation our class do a "How to", it was a big hit! The only problem I had the amount of flour used. It needed to adjust slightly, but a delicious recipe! Thanks Ms. Andersen for sharing! :)

I made half the recipe, followed the directions to the T.  I used 4 small bread pans instead.  After baking and tops golden brown and crispy, the middle was too moist.  The taste to me was bland compared to what I remember in past years.  It was okay.

Excellent!!! First time I've tried making homemade bread. Even with several small setbacks (didnt have shortening so I used butter instead) This bread turned out great. I am going to be using this alot in the original form and with different seasonings.

Easy to make and good taste. A little more dense than I like, but not as dense as most white bread recipes.  I thought it was a little too sticky, but stuck to the measurements, and it turned out fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This bread was absolutely delicious! I baked it and I'm only fifteen. This was great for the entire family! I halved it because I only had one pan to bake it in. On the second loaf I even added garlic. I baked it for only twenty minutes and then painted melted butter on the top. Then let it bake for two more minutes. Looks like I don't ever have to change my recipe!

I made this with 4.5 Tablespoons of honey and 4 C. warm water instead of the given measures.  We baked it and promptly put a little butter on the crust.  It was by far the best we've made yet.  Thanks for this recipe.

We love this recipe so much!  It's simple enough to make up during a weekend and then eat off of during the week.  It works great with sandwiches or just on it's own.  And what's nice is I don't have to have a lot of extras.

I've had the worst luck making anything yeast related, with my husbands support (almost nagging) I decided to try this recipe. Wow the bread is fantastic easy to make, simple and versatile...the shortening can easily be substituted for butter or olive oil depending on the bread you want I've made this recipe exactly the way it's written, I've added 3 extra tbs of sugar and cinammon and raisins for a nice breakfast bread or of you want a savory bread add basil, oregano, parsley, rosemary and paremesean for a cheesy herb bread...fantastic anyway you desire a great recipe with great variations...yummy...

My first time making bread and it was a hit!  I almost halved it I'm so glad I didn't.  Ended up giving some to the neighbors.  They're asking for more.  :)

Pretty good. Mine always seems to come out doughy for some reason, and I only end up using about 9 cups of flour for the entire thing. I could add more water and flour, but I'm afraid that would throw off the recipe. Everyone else here seems to like it, so it must be something I'm doing wrong, lol.  Will keep trying!

This recipe goes beyond merits.  I have been searching for a fluffy home made bread and this nailed it.  It has a nice crunch on the crust and the inside is nice and fluffy compared to my other recipe I have been using for awhile now.  Thanks so much for adding this recipe.  Very delicious!!!

My first attempt at making homemade bread and it turned out great.  My husband is very picky and he loved it.  We ate one whole loaf ourselves while still warm.  I cut the recipe in half and it made us 3 nice loaves.  I definitely will be baking this again.  Light and fluffy,  greattttt

Delicious bread. It keeps extremely well, cooks easily, and as long as one knows how to properly work with yeast, will rise like crazy to make the perfect crumb.

It was good, a bit plain, probably won't make it again. It ended up not being eaten and we had to give some of it to the squirrels.

Great recipe!!!  It was a bit difficult finding a bread recipe that didn't involve a bread machine, so I'm glad I found this one!  We cut it in half and made a loaf of bread and a dozen cinnamon rolls with it, since we didn't need that many loaves of bread.  Both turned out AMAZING!!!

I made this recipe on Saturday and was thrilled. Thought it was too good to be true, so I tried it again on Sunday.  (Large Family Gathering)  Wow, it really works!  Everyone was asking where I bought the bread.   They couldn't believe it was homemade.  Thank you!

This was the first time I ever tried to make homemade bread.  I do not own a bread machine so I'm trying to learn to do everything by hand.  Even for a newbie like me this was so easy!  Granted my loaf shaping skills probably leave something to be desired but the taste and texture are out of this world!  The first couple times I made this I used organic unbleached flour but then I started substituting in whole wheat flour for 1/3 - 1/2 of the flour amount.  Although the bread comes out a bit denser when using whole wheat flour it still turns out wonderful.  Each time I made this recipe I halved it for two loaves instead of four and everything still works out great.  I also brushed lightly with egg whites for a nicely browned top

This recipe went terribly wrong for me. I ended up with bread like hockey pucks. I think that my problem is when I was kneading the dough I put flour on the table and my hands and they kept sticking so I kept adding flour to my hands. I followed the recipe exactly. It appeared to rise wonderfully, until I divided it up and let rise the last time in the loaf tins. I also used quick rise yeast. A

Great, easy recipe.  I was worried about the shortening, because when cool it's in clumps so didn't dissolve.  Still tasted great.  Also, I stupidly began around 9pm, and left the last rising overnight.   Baked it first thing in the morning, and had fresh bread for breakfast.  Surprisingly, it worked!

I took a loaf of this bread to my parents house today and we had it with out Sunday lunch. Everyone devoured it and said it was SO good! I made 6 mini loaves today to give as gifts with the "All Day Apple Butter" on here.

I wasn't very impressed with it.  It was very heavy.  I followed the recipe as instructed, but the bread just came out so heavy (and I halved the recipe).  I will probably not make it again.

Easy, but you need to stay close to the kitchen to attend to the bread every hour or so.  Delicious, bakery quality!  I made small loaves to accompany the Sparkling Holiday Jam for gifts.

This is my fallback recipe whenever I need a fresh loaf of bread. It's hearty, rises nicely (I always tuck my loaves under the heater), and tastes delicious as a snack with butter and honey. It's rather plain and kinda crumbly though, so it's best eaten with something rather than as a sandwich bread.

I love this recipe. It is very easy to follow and to make. However, I didn't need four loaves, so I cut the recipe in half. I made one loave and twelve individual rolls. Thanks Sandra!

This was the first time I have ever made homemade bread.  It did not rise and I don't know why.  I will keep trying because the taste of the bread was very good.

I found this bread to be just a bit to heavy. But it could have been my technique. I will try it again to see how it works out!

The directions were easy, but my bread didn't rise.  I was told it was because I used a metal bowl.  I don't know if that is true or not.  But we ate it anyway.
