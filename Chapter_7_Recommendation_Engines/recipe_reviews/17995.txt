I have made many cakes from scratch and this is the worst cake I have ever tasted.  The cream cheese icing does not go well with the chocolate cake.  The cake tasted strange.  Maybe because it calls for baking soda then vinegar.  It fizzed after adding the vinegar.  I do not recommend making this cake.  I did not taste good.  I followed the directions exactly as listed.  Please don't this cake.

only used half of the oil required.  turned out fine.  frosting does not cover cake, so i mixed it with a jar of cream cheese-flavored frosting from the store and it turned out great :)

Nice, rich cake, and frosting is not too sweet, which was great. Added chocolate chips and chopped walnuts to the frosting and gave it some texture.

The cake was moist & delicious! Like one user already said, the frosting recipe wasn't quite enough, but was still great.

I made an American flag version of this cake for a 4th of July BBQ (using strawberries and blueberries), and it was a huuuge hit.  Everyone raved that it was delicious without being too rich or too sweet.  It was also very easy to prepare.

took this to a birthing class as my potluck dish...it was gobbled up by all the pregnant people and their partners.  rich, moist, delicious!  i did opt for a different icing without the raw egg though...still a five star.

I think it was a SPECTACULAR cake!!! but i think feel it goes better if you put the chocolate chips inside the cake insted of in the icing. And its not really a cheese cake its just more of a chocolate cake with amazing cream cheese frosting:)

The cake was yummy layered with the cream cheese filling that I found in another recipe. The cake wasn't really cake like, more dense. If I was set on a cakey cake I would have been disappointed but what it turnned out to be was good.

Not enough sugar. If I had at least doubled the sugar, it might have been okay.

This cake was terrible, the top turned out almost like plastic and the center was moist but tasteless. I took it out of the oven with 15 min left, anymore time in the oven and it would have been too dry.  Oil and vinegar and baking soda do not mix well with the flavor of instant coffee. And cream cheese frosting to top it off made it worse.

The cake was bland and the frosting disappointing, better to stick with regular cream cheese frosting and add walnuts or chocolate chips if you want.  I would not recommend this recipe.
