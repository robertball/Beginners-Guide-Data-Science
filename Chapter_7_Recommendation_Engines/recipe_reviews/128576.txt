This recipe is very fresh-tasting and the herbs are wonderful. However the suggestion to bake the eggplant was not a good idea. It made my eggplant mush so I couldn't include it. I instead diced a raw yellow squash I had on hand and tossed it in the oven with the other ingredients for the recommended time. This worked out really well. My onion was nice and mild so even though it retained some crunch its flavor wasn't too strong. Quinoa is one of my favorite grains (worth a try if you've never had it!) and it went really well with the other fresh ingredients. This is a great one for dinner after a summer trip to the farmer's market.

Thought this was great. Instead of baking (I know better for you) I fried in cast iron skillet adding onion & garlic then rest of ingredients. Added some mushrooms too. Was perfect made it in half of the suggested cooking time and entire family (two four year olds & hubbie) loved it. Definitely will do again!

Very bland. I did not think it was worth time and effort.

Very good easy to make. I served with quinoa as a main dish and again the next day with meat and quinoa as a side dish. It was good cold the next day! Will make again
