This is very yummy though I wasn't in love with the lemon zest in this recipe. I cooked the entire dish in a heavy dutch oven with wonderfully tender results. My market did not have shallots so I subbed small boiler onions. I also see no need to mix the stock, vinegar and brown sugar separately since the entire mixture is going to braise for two hours which would blend the flavors well. This recipe reminds me of a french stew recipe I have made for years that is highlighted by tarragon. Next time I will throw some in for additional flavor. I served this over creamy polenta with a crisp salad and braised carrots. Pour a good glass of Zinfandel or Cabernet and you have a delicious budget friendly meal fit for a king and QUEEN!

This was a delicious Sunday night dish for us!  To save a little prep time, I used beef stew meat already cut into cubes.  The shallots I had on hand were a little large, so I peeled and thinly sliced three of them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written, and served over egg noodles.  The flavors came together nicely, and we all enjoyed it.  I will be making this one again!

This recipe was a big hit in my house!   I used a 2-1/2 lb. chuck roast and cut it in cubes about the size you would use in beef stew.  The meat came out perfectly tender and the sauce was rich and flavorful with the use of the balsamic and beef stock.  There was a slight sweetness from the brown sugar and balsamic, but, we really liked it.  The sauce was a little thin for how I wanted to serve it, so, I added a cornstarch slurry at the end to slightly thicken it and it was perfect.  My husband was not a fan of the lemon zest on the top, but, I liked it.   I served it over garlic mashed potatoes and it was a perfect meal!

The meat turned out extremely tender, it was very easy to eat. I added carrots and broccoli to this dish, they turned out tender and very full of flavor. I would put a little less zest on it next time, to much zest and it stands out way to much. I also used some lemon juice on my dish after it was plated. Overall it was good.

It takes some time, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon, but its comfort food at its finest.

This was tasty. I liked how it was basically from scratch. My main change was a complete reduction in cook time. I am not a fan of stove-top sauteed stewing beef, which was what I had. I cut the beef into 1-1 1/2" pieces. I lined a large sided sheet pan, with heavy duty foil, and broiled the beef until lightly browned. I sprayed the foil and beef with olive oil, before broiling, and when done broiling seasoned lightly with black pepper and garlic salt instead of the 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp of pepper before cooking. For the shallots I just did 1/2 cup minced. I didn't want to get out my scale to weigh out 8oz. I cooked them for about 6-7 minutes. I have never added both balsalmic vinegar and brown sugar to a dish. Unsure how that would taste I did 1 Tblsp of balsalmic vinegar and 1/2 Tblsp of sugar. For the stock I used 100% natural Swanson Beef Broth in a can. It was what my local store had. I probably also added a little more mushrooms and used them sliced, as they came, instead of quartering. After I added the meat back, I turned the heat to about 3, and simmered 15-20 more minutes and then served. I may try it a little longer, next time, to see the difference. I just did not want this to turn into completely shredded meat or too mushy in texture for today. ty

I turned this into a vegetarian meal by using a bag of Boca beef crumbles instead of the beef. I let it simmer for about 25 minutes to combine the flavors. My whole family loved it.

Love it! Served it over Basmati rice with a little ground thyme and garlic salt. It complimented the flavors of the beef so well. I read some of the reviews so I didn't use the lemon zest.  I will be making this again!

My wife's first comment, who isn't a big beef eater, was "this beef is ridiculous!".  That alone sums it up. A little work up front but rewarded with deep rich broth and extremely tender beef that worked well over potato pancakes and I'm sure mashed will be just as good for the next serving. The recipe is pretty straight forward and gives great results that even a well rounded cook will feel quite proud to serve. Thanks Campbells!

Just replace all things Campbell's with quality items.  use Grass fed beef, fresh ingredients and take your time...simmer is the key here.  I've made this about 1o times over the past decade an still love all the flavors!  Remember...fresh, simmer and time!

I made this dish but instead of mushrooms I made it with carrots and served it over white rice. It was very tasty and easy to make. Instead of mixing the brown sugar in a separate bowl with the stock and vinegar I added them directly to the pot one at a time. I didn't use the lemon or parsley and next time I will probably use a little less brown sugar.

Very good method of cooking. I also added carrots. Nice and tender. I think the stock made it a little too salty for my tastes; but if it were served over rice or with potatoes that would compensate very nicely.

I like the addition of tomatoes to a savory, beefy "stew".  I like the quartered mushrooms too.  I had to add quite a bit of extra beefy flavor with Magi Beef Sprinkles.   Served over savory mashed potatoes and it was a hit.  I did not add the vinegar or the lemon.. just sounded awful for our palate but otherwise followed the recipe.  Had to refrigerate over night because of an emergency but I bet it just made it taste even better.
