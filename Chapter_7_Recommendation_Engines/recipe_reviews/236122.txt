I tried this for a potluck at work and everyone loved it.  I was one of the first dishes gone.  It's a bit sweet and a touch spicy and the soup adds a creamy savory quality that is very unique, but no one ever guessed there was canned soup in it.  I chopped the chicken pretty small, but this dip still needs fairly sturdy chips to hold up to it.
