They do take practice but the recipe is perfect. My teenaged brother made sesame wafers last Christmas and I absolutely loved them! This recipe was quick delicious and brought back some pleasant memories. I used parchment paper instead of greasing / flouring and after cooling for a few minutes I simply lifted the paper and peeled it from the wafers.

Not quite the recipe I was looking for but very tasty light cookie. I baked mine on foil (the dull side) left them overnight and they peeled off easily. Great quick morning snack for teens!
