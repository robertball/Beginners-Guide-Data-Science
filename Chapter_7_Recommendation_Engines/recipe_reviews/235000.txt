Great base for the recipe we altered it because we wanted it to taste like one we have at a local restaurant. We used one can of coconut milk. About 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth. 1/2 can sweetened condensed milk. 1 cup of milk. Added salt. And about 3 TBSP of Peanut butter. Delicious!!! Next time I might get more coconut milk but we only had one can in the house. But the sweetened condensed milk made it amazing. We also put rice in our bowl with the recipe poured on top of it. Delicious and will make it again. Sure beats spending $25 eating out at our favorite restaurant once a week. ;)

Fabulous!  This recipe is easy and fast.  After making it several times, I use less coconut milk because I like a stronger curry flavor.  Delicious.

EXCELLENT!  thank you for this wonderful, easy recipe...I LOVE yellow chicken curry and have been ordering it from the local rest. (to go) for several years...paying $10-$15 each time, depending on if it was lunch or dinner...I did this at least once a week (that's how much I LOVE it :) ).  I will NEVER again need to do this - this recipe tastes JUST like what I've been ordering and only cost me about $1.80 per meal....think of all the money I'll be saving and now I can have it for every meal if I so desire....Just delicious.  I added extra curry, salt and used one chicken bouillon cube in a cup of water instead of the broth (I was out of broth) ...I may add more spice next time as I like it HOT.  I can't wait to taste it again...think I'll go heat up another bowl of it ummmm ummm good :)

I made it as is, then made some adjustments to fit my taste better. I used serrano peppers, no potato since we are serving over rice. Then I used 2 extra Tbs curry powder, 1/2 the chicken stock, 2x coconut milk to help make it thicker. Used all veggies plus added bean sprouts, water chestnuts, shiitake mushroom and green onion. Used chicken thighs in lieu of breast for more flavor and tenderness. Plus added 1lb shrimp. It taste more authentic now but the recipe was a good start. thx

We loved it.  I left out the peppers, fish sauce, and chicken broth.  There was more than enough sauce with two cans of coconut milk. I used Krogers brand lite coconut milk, and the sauce came out thick.  Just the right spice burn.  Next time I may add another tablespoon or two of the curry paste because I love the curry taste.

This was just AMAZING!  Instead of 3 thai peppers I used one jalapeño and one Serrano.  Had perfect amount of 'medium' heat for us.  I also added 1 inch of lemongrass.  After cooking it let it stew in Dutch oven on simmer pretty much whole day.   I watched an old espisiode of Rachael ray where she was cooking red chicken curry and she said making curry in advance is the way to go so the flavors meld .

 My husband said  it was exactly like Thai restuarants.   Out of all the recipes I have used on this site this is the best one!  You have to try this, you won't be disappointed !

Flavor was OK, but the sauce was incredibly thin. Not sure what went wrong, but this was a big miss for me.

A great recipe and everyone I have cooked it for all say the same... It is easy and very tasty! Also for those who thinks it is too runny you can thicken it up... I use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with a tablespoon of water mix that together and then add it to the curry!! But use whatever you think is best.Thank you for this fabulous recipe!!

OH MY GOD this is so good that I ate way to much. I've been looking for a recipe like this forever. This is exactly like the yellow curry I get at a restaurant that I go to. Now I can make it at home for the whole family. We all loved it. Thank you regancooks for the fantastic recipe.

This recipe is simply amazing just the way it is.  If you do what it says to a "T" you will be very happy.  I DO NOT understand why people who don't follow the recipe give it one and three stars.  Understandable not to put as many peppers for  less spicy if that's what you want, however, Put THE 2 cans of coconut milk and include the chicken stock...follow the recipe..you will get it right.

Overall a nice recipe although needed additional flavor, it came out a little bland. I added curry powder, garlic powder and chicken bouillon. Next time i'll add minced garlic and ginger.

I didn't have the curry paste so instead i used the curry powder.  I also added minced garlic and minced ginger for a stronger smell and taste.  For the broth I dissolved a Tbsp of Knorr tomato bouillon with chicken flavor.  This recipe is very easy to prepare and tastes amazing.  Thank you for sharing!

This was amazing. I forgot to add the fish sauce at the end, but it was still good. I added salt (but maybe the fish sauce would have avoided the need for salt).

I made this curry recipe and found it to be  just ok. There was way too much liquid. It was really more like a soup. Next time I will eliminate the chicken stock and add more salt and pepper. I think this will result in a thicker, creamier, more flavorful sauce.

Phenomenal recipe.  I followed the original recipe except that I added sliced carrots about 10 minutes before it was ready and I excluded the peppers since my family doesn't handle spice well.  This is my favorite recipe from AllRecipes.  My family raved about it and has asked for it several times in the two weeks since I originally made it.   I do think the curry paste makes this dish.  We enjoy leftovers, so I actually tripled everything the last two times I made it and it turned out perfectly.   Many  thanks to the person who submitted this as it is just as good as what you find at a Thai restaurant.

I used full fat coconut milk the first time and it was a little oily.  I am going to try light coconut milk the next time.

I found this to be a simple to follow recipe, definitely use the recommended curry paste, however my suggestion is to start with only 1 Tbs. of curry paste first,( again to taste if you desire a spicier curry add more paste) I prefer a sweeter flavored taste to my curry so I've added 1 Tbs. of sugar  again according to taste. the suggested 25 min.cook time is spot on my potatoes were perfect done, I added carrot slices as well. definitely a keeper recipe for me.

Used whole can of yellow curry paste, 1 can coconut milk + chicken stock. Added for veggies: onion, garlic, 2 carrots, zucchini, squash, long john peppers, fresh basil. Can add the extra can of coconut milk (or coconut cream!) at the end if too spicy (or if kids are eating). Yum!

This was a really great base recipe I will use from now on. I made it exactly as written minus the peppers because I am a weakling with spice and minus the fish sauce (I didn't have it). It had nice flavor, but wasn't potent enough for me, so I added ginger, salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I added corn starch to thicken it, and carrots because that's what I'm used to. It was great! My tip, take half of the batch aside and mix in some peanut butter or PB2 (dried pb powder) and you'll have a mock masaman (my other favorite Thai dish). So yummy. Thank you!

It tasted similar to our favorite Thai restaurant, not exactly the same, but better than some other restaurants we've tried yellow curry. I added carrots and did not put in the fish oil.

Was pleased with this!

Adjustments:

*Used a couple mini potatos I had on hand. They weren't red potatos and it was fine. Also par cooked the potato by boiling whole and slicing ahead of simmering in curry sauce - worked well

*Added thinly sliced baby carrot, green zucchini and yellow peppers because I like veggies and had them on hand. :) 

*Used red chili paste instead of red thai chili peppers because I couldn't find them 

*Skipped fish sauce because I don't love it and it was already in both the yellow curry paste and the chili paste.

Was very happy with how this turned out and my husband  went back for seconds :) win! Thanks for the recipe.

Great Thai yellow curry recipe. Ive been looking for a recipe that replicates ones in traditional Thai restaurants and this is the closest I've came to. I used two and a half pounds of meat so I did add two extra tablespoons of the curry paste. I also added garlic and like others said, the sauce is a little thin so add cornstarch or flour at the end to thicken it up. if you don't like too much heat, then three peppers is plenty. I added four and a half and it came out too spicy (7/10) for my liking. I'll def add bell peppers and maybe carrots next time.

Great base if you want to try a yellow curry.  Like most, I thought it was way too much coconut milk so I only used 1 can.  Experiment with it to find your taste.

Rather than yellow, it came out gray. It had a gritty texture to it too. Tasted good, but no where near the flavor I was looking for. I did not precook the chicken, perhaps that was the problem.

Excellent!!!! It did need a tad more flavor, so I added an extra tablespoon of the curry paste. I will be making this again!

This is a great recipe.  I actually make more a a chili.  I add ground turkey, corn, white beans.
To thicken it up, when I am about ready, I whisk in instant mashed potatoes to make it more of a chili/sauce consistency.
I also make my own chicken stock with the chicken they tell you to use.  I boil the meat right off the bones, let it shred naturally and then just fish for the bones.  It comes out amazing.

This was a great recipe and my wife loved it!  I did a couple of changes, but the biggest one was using 1 can of coconut milk instead of two.  Add your own heat and vegetables, it is a great base!

Maybe a little less coconut milk and a bit more curry paste next time but the current recipe is really tasty.

I am a novice when it comes to Indian cooking so I was very nervous about trying this dish.  My sister-in-law who is more adventurous than I, gave me a jar of yellow Thai curry paste.  I enjoyed the dish, especially the potatoes.  I changed the recipe just a bit.  I used only 1 can of coconut milk and ½ cup of chicken stock.  Otherwise there would have been WAY too much liquid. Just before I took it off the stove I incorporated some cornstarch to thicken it and it worked well.  Very happy.

Loved this recipe!   Super easy.  I added a bit more curry paste with the 2 cans of coconut milk to get more flavor.  The store near my house only had red curry paste but still turned out great. I added sliced bell peppers and pineapple chunks as well as salt.

Excellent! In addition to the above recipe, I added shrimp, green bean, bamboo, corn, small peas and carrot. I adjust the spice using Red Chili powder. I like it better when it is just one can of coconut milk.

Very good!  I've made this with shrimp, chicken or tofu.  Also, I've used it with red, green and yellow curry paste.  I normally subtract the chicken broth.  It always turns out great.  My family loves it!  Tonight I'll try Tilapia.
