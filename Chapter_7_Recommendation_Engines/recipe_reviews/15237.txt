Despite the 2-stars, I do have to say the "crust" to these bars - is pretty good!!  I might use the crust part of this recipe again - with a different topping - not sure what...However, we didn't care for the chocolate - raisin topping at all.  Also  - the salted peanuts - I just sprinkled those over the top, at the very end - since it wasn't specified in the recipe.  Thanks anyway!   PS - I much preferred the absolutely terrific Peanut Brittle Cookies by this same submitter...do try them!!!!!
