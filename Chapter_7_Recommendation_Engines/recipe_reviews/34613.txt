Awesome! Have made this several times now since I found it almost a year ago, and it never fails to get rave reviews, out of the 80 or so recipes I have tried off of this site, this has been by far the most successful!   Instead of tossing the salad, I layer it as pictured on a large serving plate, b/c I think it looks so striking that way.  FYI - Roquefort is a type of blue cheese, so it can be easily substituted with your favorite blue.  I buy a good Danish Blue from Trader Joes. For lettuce I use 1 and 1/2 of the 10 oz. size bags of mixed greens...perfect amt. of lettuce.  I use bosc pears, I find that they have good crunch that compliments the rest of the salad. Use red onion instead of green for color. I omit the avocado, unneccesary and browns fast, which isn't helpful if you are traveling with this salad.  The dressing...is absolutely amazing.  I always use dijon mustard for extra "tang".  Double the dressing, and please use the red wine vinegar, as the recipe states! Don't sub in balsamic, it is much stronger than red wine and the taste would be off. The only other thing I do differently is add more carmelized pecans. BIGGEST CRUCIAL TIP:  To properly carmelize your pecans, add 1-2 Tbsp. water to the pecans and sugar.  This helps melt the sugar evenly over the pecans.  If you do not add the water, the sugar may burn, or you will end up with rock hard sugar pieces that will break your teeth!  Enjoy, if a salad can be considered phenomenal, this is it!

I was fully expecting to be disappointed just because of all the excellent reviews this recipe has gotten but it was fantastic. The combination of creaminess (cheese, avocado), sweetness (pear, nuts), crunchiness (nuts) and the tangy dressing really deliver. I did not think it was possible to crave a salad but I was wrong!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! NOTE: I have made this recipe a few times now. I decided to try someone else's advice to add water when caramelizing the pecans to cut down on the time and I very much regretted doing that. You end up with sugar coated pecans rather then caramelized ones. Not at all the same taste and texture.

This salad is fabulous... got raves at my holiday brunch. I definitely recommend doubling the dressing recipe, as well as making it the nite before as it really allows the flavors to blend. Don't skimp out on the avocado... the creamy texture is a wonderful addition!!

I've probably made this 10 times since trying it a couple of months ago!  It's THAT good!  I use romaine lettuce and sweet Mayan onion.  I doubled all the dressing ingredients EXCEPT the olive oil (still emulsifies just fine), and used dijon mustard.  When making the candied nuts, I did 2 or 3 times the amounts listed and put the extra in a container - that way I could have the salad again without taking the time to do the nuts!  Also, when the nuts were ALMOST done, I sprinkled a small amount of salt over them to balance against all the sugar.  This is my all-time favorite salad!  Even people who don't like blue cheese (I used to be one of them) like a small amount of it in this salad with all its other ingredients!

I made this recipe and it was DELICIOUS!  I substituted the blue cheese with gorgonzola cheese (its a little milder in my opinion)  I would also recommend spraying the wax paper with PAM because it was hard to get the wax paper off the nuts.

Awesome! 
I've made this salad for 4 different holiday events and it was always the first thing to go, everyone keeps asking me for the recipe! I did make a few changes though, I omitted the avocado as I'm not a hige fan, I also used mixed greens instead of leaf lettuce, I used thinly sliced red onion for color, I used walnuts intstead of pecans, only because it's what I had, and since my husband doesn't care for blue cheese I used gorgonzola. I made it this way each time and each time i got asked to bring it to another party! I put the ingredients in baggies and toss right before serving. YUM!

This was excellent. I made it for a dinner party and it was gone. I'm a big fan of the Harvest Vine salad (on allrecipes too) and this hit that same nice flavor. 

I used walnuts instead and next time I will just toast them (or maybe just use a bit less sugar). I also used walnut oil insteead of olive oil. It complimented the salad very well. (If you use hazelnuts you might want to consider hazelnut oil). I omitted the avocado and think next time I make it (and there will be a next time!) I might sprinkle some dried cranberries on top for some added color. 

Besides these small changes, I think the recipe is great and is sure to impress the fam and/or company!

My husband proclaimed this the best salad he's ever tasted -- and we are both salad maniacs.  This was an excellent blend of flavors.  The only think I'm considering adding is some crumbled bacon, but I might not mess with what works!

This salad is fabulous!  I've made it about a dozen times and alter it just slightly:  I use a bag of spring greens and 1/2 head of romaine, chopped.  Instead of the green onions, I use sliced red onion for a little bit of sweetness and texture.  I do not peel the pears, it still tastes great and cuts down on time.  The avocado I only add if I am serving the salad immediately, otherwise it is best to leave out (it will brown way too fast).  In regards to the sugared pecans, I usually add a little butter to the sugar and a dash of all-spice to give them more flavor.  I do double the dressing (but not the olive oil) and I use honey instead of sugar so it is not grainy.  I always use dijion mustard, and let the dressing sit overnight to blend the flavors. This is my go-to recipe when I have to bring something to share! I love it!

I made this salad last year for my fall dinner party and decided to make it again this year. I love this salad.  I make the dressing the night before so the flavors have a chance to blend.  To save time I use the premade salad bags.  I also usually double the dressing since it goes really fast.  You will get a nice tang if you use dijon mustard in your dressing.   Blue cheese is the best however gorgonzola works just as well.

I have to say that this is one of the most unique and delicious salads that I have ever prepared.  I brought it to a turkey dinner with friends, and got plenty of compliments.  It's a good winter salad with lots of flavors that compliment a holiday-like meal (turkey, ham, etc).


Ok, so I did change a couple things.  One out of necessity and another to save time:  


I could not find the specified cheese in the grocery, so I substituted with feta.  The feta worked very well with the other flavors.  I suppose I could have bought a different blue cheese, but was not sure of my friends preferences, however I love blue cheese, and it would have worked well with the salad.


Another change, I bought pre-glazed nuts, instead of glazing them myself.  This was out of pure laziness, but no one noticed the difference until I was asked, and had to fess up. :)


I made the salad in the morning before work, and served it that evening.  A tip from a friend about making salads ahead: dressing on the bottom, toppings like meat and other veggies put in next, the lettuce and finally cheese.  Then toss before serving.  This keeps the lettuce from wilting, and nicely marinates the other ingredients.  Good tip huh?  


Make this salad exactly as told.  You will not be disappointed!  It would also work as a meal on it's own, with some chicken, turkey, or ham mixed in.

This salad is fantastic and gets rave reviews from my guests!  It is delicious.  My only problem was the carmelized nuts stuck to the waxed paper.  My 3rd time making the recipe, I used a Silpat instead of waxed paper and that worked much better.

Excellent salad!!! One thing I did differently. I used maple syrup instead of sugar and it worked great. Also, I didn't find that the avocado added anything to the salad. I think it's safe to use blue cheese or Stillton if you can't find Roquefort.

excellent salad!  My husband loves both blue cheese and pears...so this one was really a hit with him.  Not really sure I will do the avaocado next time; just don't think it needed it or enhanced the flavor.  I added just a tad more sugar.

I very strongly disliked the flavor of mustard with pear. This salad would be great with a non-mustardy dressing, or if the pears were substituted out with something less disgusting with mustard on it. Cucumbers maybe. I served this with "Famous Butter Chicken" from this site and rather liked dipping my chicken in the dressing, but I wish my pears had just been in a dish on the side! Thanks for sharing -- if we all had the exact same tastes, the world would be dull!

Excellent salad!  I always get requests for this recipe, even by salad snobs!  One thing I do for ease in prep is buy the glazed pecans at the store, so much easier and saves on time!  I like adding a little dried cranberries for texture and color.  TIP: After slicing pears keep them covered in water and chilled until ready to use.  Helps them from browning too fast and maintains the crunchy texture!  You will get tons of compliments on this salad, guaranteed!

Delicious! This is exactly the salad recipe I have been searching for. Make sure to follow the directions and let the nuts cool on the wax paper completely-otherwise they will stick. I used walnuts instead, omitted the avocado and green onions, added dried cranberries for color & taste. I didn't have any red wine vinegar so used balsamic vinegar instead. I did use dijon mustard and I also used bosc pears. I let the dressing sit overnight to allow the flavors to meld and shook the bottle before drizzling the dressing on the salad. It was a hit at my party!

Ditto, this is the best salad i've ever had, and everyone for whom i've made it has said the same thing! I would just recommend doubling the candied pecans, and putting in at least 2-3 avocados. Also, when candying the pecans, they will taste better if fully toasted so you may want to go a minute beyond when the sugar melts (and the key is to stir them constantly from beginning so that they are coated/toasted evenly). I found it easier to separate them immediately rather than waiting until they were cooled as big clumps tended to stick to wax paper.

WOW!  I am in love w/this salad.  It's awesome.  I made a few changes, per personal taste:  swapped toasted hazelnuts for the pecans and left out the avocados.  I also subbed gorgonzola for roquefort due to lack of availability.  I followed the dressing to a "T" (even measuring stuff!).  I can't say enough about this salad; it just works.  This is def my new "go-to" company salad!  Even Mr. LTH, who is a die hard ranch on my salad man, ate & enjoyed this salad.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Made this for a dinner party last week.  Certainly will be be a staple recipe for this house.    Mixed lettuce with most of the dressing.  Spread lettuce on large platter, then layered the other items on top, drizzling remaining dressing over all.  Every bit of the salad was gone.  Made six generous servings.

awesome!  LOVED the pecans.  I used 2 romaine heads and doubled the dressing but didn't use it all.  I only used 2 pears- 3 would have been way too many.  So good.  I served the blue cheese on the side and gave the option of feta as well.  thanks!

This salad is DELICIOUS! I love the various textures and "mouth feel". 
I think she forgot to mention that you need to add about 1 tbsp of water to the sugar for the pecans - you can't melt the sugar without it ;)
I'm making this again in a few day. Outstanding!

This is a very good salad!  Like others, I didn't add the avocado ~ I don't think it would have made the salad better.  I did spray my waxed paper with Pam spray and had no problems with the pecans.

This salad is amazing.  I took this to a birthday party, and people kept going back for more.  The dressing is delicious and goes perfectly with the salad.  I couldn't find roquefort so I used gorgonzola instead, and substituted walnuts for the pecans (to sneak in some omega-3s).

This was quite possibly one of the best salads I have ever eaten. At first I thought the combination of flavors might be a bit too funky for me, but it was absolutely delicious! I have already made it twice and I have my friends trying it out as well. Thanks so much for a great recipe!!

The pears, caramelized pecans, and sweet/tangy dressing makes this overall a pretty sweet salad.  The roquefort cheese provides good contrast.  The textures and flavors work very well together.  It's delicious and simple to make.  Highly recommendable!

Excellent! I added chicken breast meat and omitted the avocado (didn't have it on hand). I also used apple cider vinegar (no red wine vinegar on hand). The roquefort and pears are so smooth and the crunchy sweet pecans top off the salad nicely. Thanks. I plan to make this for company!

Instead of cooling the pecans on wax paper, use parchment instead.  They won't stick.

YUM, YUM, AND YUM!  In a weeks time I've made this salad three times and EVERYONE wanted the recipe. I used spinach instead (because it was what I had on hand) in addition I added dried cherries.  By far, this is one of my favorite salads.  Thank you Michelle so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Very tasty, good contrast of flavors.  However, my kids didn't care for the dressing.  So next time it will be on the side with the bottle of ranch.

I loved this salad.  I added a few dried cranberries just for color but they added a nice texture and sweetness to the salad.  This will become part of my salad rotation.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I'm not the best cook, but I make this for every function that I'm required to bring food.  It's a hit every time!  Much of my family is vegetarian and they rate it high marks claiming that it is a very filling salad.  I made double the dressing.  The salad tastes even better after you let the dressing and salad marinate for a few hours. I also use feta cheese instead of roquefort. Lastly, I let the pecans cool on an oiled metal cookie sheet. Try not to break them up with your hands. Instead, crush them with a tool.  I've cut myself using my hands.  Not cool.

Absolutely incredible salad! I made it for a large family birthday dinner and everyone loved it so much they asked me to make it for Christmas dinner as well as demanded the recipe. I made a couple changes; I used reduced fat feta cheese instead of roquefort and decided I wanted the crunchines of romaine lettuce which turned out to be perfect! I used others' suggestions and added a tablespoon or two of water when I carmelized the pecans as well as made the dressing the night before and served it on the side so I didn't have soggy leftovers. Thanks so much for this amazing recipe! It will be a regular crowd pleaser!

SO GOOD! I added some sliced grilled chicken to make it a main dish. My husband said "There are so many different flavors going on here. The only problem with it is that my mouth is not big enough to put in as much as I want to." The salad was really good, thanks for the recipe!

I first tried this recipe when my mom tore it out of a newspaper ad, and it has always been a favorite.  I've found that using 2 avocados doubles the fun; you can't have too much of their creamy texture.  I also use d'anjou pears, chopped and not peeled, which makes the salad look very pretty and green.  I prefer spinach to lettuce, and have found that the chewier texture of spinach complements this salad well.

This recipe is great!  I've made it twice for different parties and everyone loved it.  I left out the avocado and onions and I used crumbled gorgonzola cheese instead of  roquefort.  I also used yellow mustard (that's all I had).  I doubled this recipe for 12 people and I tripled the dressing.  There wasn't enough the first time I made it.  I broke the pecans before carmelizing and tripled the amount. My daughters kept steeling them.  I also put pam on the wax paper so they would not stick. I used six heads of romaine hearts.

Wow! What a wonderful salad. I'll surely be making it again - and soon. I had been looking for something different to serve to company, and this was perfect. And the other reviews are right - even the men like it. I may try to use red onion instead of green onion next time, as I think that would be tasty with the blue cheese.

Amazing salad.  The only things we changed were 2 instead of 3 pears and added honey to the dressing to thicken it up.  By far our new favorite salad.  Can't wait to make it again.

Delicious either way, but if you are not a big fan of blue cheese like me, then feta is a great substitute.

I tried this and loved it! Gave 4 stars because I didn't like the Roquefort cheese. I prefer a milder and creamier Rosenborg.

This was AWESOME!! Made this last night for Thanksgiving & it was a hit. The only thing I did differently was add a bit of water (about 1.5 tablespoons) to the pecan mixture so that the sugar would set up. It wouldn't melt under the heat on my stovetop. It was delicious & I had to keep shooing people away from the pecans!

This salad is every bit as good as everyone says it is.  As others have said, make the dressing the night before and double the recipe.  I added pomegranate seeds for an extra burst of holiday flavor.  I found that pre-dressing the salad resulted in soggy greens, so the second time I made this, I let each person dress his own portion.  Everyone LOVED this.  It's now a holiday tradition at our house.

The execution of flavors in this salad is nigh on perfect. The candied pecans against the tangy, creamy cheese. The lightly seasoned vinaigrette. Well done. That said, the process for making the pecans is just whack. Do not, and I repeat DO NOT, place those molten hot sugared nuts on waxed paper. I had a very bad moment when I realized they had superglued themselves to it immediately, and had to salvage them with a sharp knife (scrapping off bits of waxed paper). Also. I do NOT recommend just tossing nuts and sugar in a saucepan all willy-nilly. This created white sugar-blobs that would not melt. Adding water helped; however, refrain from adding cold water to hot sugar. (Results in candy shrapnel, trust me.) The nuts also ended up tough and overcooked. In the future, and as a suggestion to those wishing to try this recipe; toast your pecans beforehand and melt the sugar alone. Once the sugar is liquid and a golden color, add nuts, coat quickly, and remove to -parchment- paper. Thanks for a light, different salad.

My boyfriend and I were invited to a friend's house for dinner and they served us this salad as a starter... And let me tell you, we could not get over how incredibly tasty this salad was...Keep in mind they also had filet mignon wrapped in applewood bacon served with homemade au gratin potatoes WHICH were also to die for and yet we kept coming back to the salad!  They told us they got the recipe off this site! 
Highlights of the salad were: the soft-creamy texture of the avocados in contrat with the crunchy pears, the dressing was not over whelming it gave a great balance to all the veggies... and the toasted-carmelized walnuts made it all come together... This is definitely THE SALAD to try!

Excellent!  I doubled the dressing as others had suggested, but I did not toss it with the salad and let my guests dress it themselves.  I added dried cranberries and doubled the sugared pecans.  I think doubling the pecans is absolutely essential.  Everyone raved over it.  Don't skip the avacado - it adds a wonderfully creamy texture.  I added a little lemon juice to the fruit to make sure it didn't brown.  I used dijon mustard and gorganzola cheese.  Adding this in my rotation!

FANTASTIC!!!! I took this to a salad supper @ the church & everyone wanted the recipe! Some of the reviews suggested that the salad dressing amount needed be doubled. I followed the advice but put 1/2 on the salad and the other 1/2 on the side in case anyone wanted more but no one did.  It was just right.  Thans for a GREAT recipe!

Very tasty. We really liked the dressing (I doubled it) and even the avocado was a nice addition. My boyfriend absolutely hated candied pecans and was moodily fishing them out for 15 minutes. Nevertheless, since that time he keeps on telling me how good salads are and why don't I make this one again.

Phenomenal recipe!  Took it to a potluck, and was a huge hit!  I did take the advice of leaving out the avocado, and it was perfect... can't imagine that this salad needs it added.

Did anyone take a look at the number of calories in this?? Don't make it if you're looking for something healthy, or if you're planning to eat other things with your meal in addition to the salad.

Excellent salad, used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine and honey dijon mustard in the dressing. The salad was a little cloudy because of all the cheese and ripe avacado but very good!

I tried this salad for company this weekend...the bowl was empty at the end of dinner.  Instead of the usual "seconds" of meat and potatoe, everyone we taking more of this salad! The flavors blend wonderfully.  The only change I made was using white wine vinegar, adding 1 TB of honey to lighten up the mustard tang just a bit, and omitting the avacado and onion (only because I forgot to add them to my shopping list).  Excellent salad - a keeper that will be made many times again.  Oh, and don't forget to do the pecans this way...they are a wonderful, sweet, crunchy addition to an already great salad.  Thank you for sharing this one!

This was a beautiful and delicious salad. I used a prepared Honey Dijon dressing in place of the recipe, and it turned out very well. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks.

Awesome salad!  I admit I had moments of doubt as I taste-tested the dressing and put the salad together...but the result was a wonderful blend of complementary flavors.  I was unsure of what kind of mustard to use...yellow, dijon?  I tried a spicy brown mustard and it turned out great!

YUM!  This is the first review I have done but I had to add it because this was sooo good.  The only changes I would make are eliminating the avocado because you can barely taste it, using less sugar, and not breaking up the pecans.

Absolutely amazing! :)) Both my best friend Noel and I loved it - what 
a stunning combination of flavors, with the juicy pears, tangy cheese and 
crunchy and sweet pecans. Simply yummy. Oh, and we both decided it'd 
make a perfect dish for a dinner date. :) So next time...

Delicious!  I didn't have avocados but the salad was divine even without them.  The nuts were easier than I anticipated.  Sometimes caramel is tricky but this came together perfectly in my non-stick 10" skillet.  I recommend doubling the nuts - they are that good.  I will make this salad again and again.

This salad is a hit.  I substitued the pears with Asian pears...yummmm.  There is more crunch than regular pears.  They slice nice and thin and the presentation is beautiful.  People have requested this salad over and over.

a confirmed blue cheese hater; I found it pallatable in this salad in small amounts. 
Round two I sub'ed in feta as suggested by others and yummo.  
I added a small amount of butter to the melted sugar (before adding the pecans) to prevent tooth cracking sugar rocks.

I brought this recipe to a potluck and everybody loved it and asked for the recipe.  Very tasty, especially with the blue cheese.  The only change I made was substituting spinach for the leaf lettuce.

I really really liked this salad. My husband isn't a fan of vinaigrette so if you don't like the taste, I wouldn't make this. The sweet taste of the pear mixed with the caramelized pecans was wonderful. I used feta instead of Roquefort and it was still great.

This has quickly become my favorite salad, the flavors complement each other very nicely. Even my husband who will rarely eat a salad, loves it. I substitute the green onions for red onion...gives it a little more color and I prefer the taste. When I first made the pecans I was doubtful about not adding any liquid, but followed the recipe and they turned out nice and crunchy. Perfect!

I really loved the combination of flavors in this salad but I didn't care for the dressing.  It was too tart for us so I'll be looking to make some improvements next time but I will make this salad again.  It was great.

Perfect!

I was looking for a salad to make for my wife's birthday BBQ, that will be a bit less on the traditional Greek mix side - and boy, is this it! No additions or alterations, top notch! Thank you, Michelle!

Very good dressing (though I cut the sugar down to 1/2 tsp). I used crumbled goat cheese instead of roquefort in the salad, since some of my family don't like anything that's a blue cheese or related to that family of cheeses. I also used baby spinach leaves instead of the leaf lettuce for the iron boost.

I absolutely loved this salad...in fact everyone did- I made it for a holiday dinner.  I did use Gorgonzola instead of Blue Cheese since Gorgonzola is a little less potent and I wanted my kids to eat it too, but the complexity and wonderful balance of all the diverse flavors is amazing.  I will definitely be making this again.  Note:  I thought there might be a lot left over, so I served the dressing on the side and let each person dress their salads individually.

Yes, it really is THAT good! What a perfect combination of flavors. I used thinly sliced red onions instead of the green onions. I did not use an avocado because mine wasn't ripe. I don't think I was missing out on anything. It was perfect as is.

A work of art! Great mix of flavors and textures, and OUTSTANDING dressing. The blue cheese is meant to star, with all the other ingredients in supporting roles, but for extra flavor-- or for your blue cheese haters (my hubby)-- use a generous sprinkling of black pepper! Yum! He did eat up all my candied pecans though :-(   (DON'T ADD WATER!!!!)

Wonderful!! You need to add a little more than one Tbs of water to the peacans to get them caramelized. I used Gorgonzola cheese instead. The BEST salad introduced on this website!!

I've made this many times - I'm not a roquefort fan so I use goat cheese or leave it out altogether.  Very versatile - many excellent suggestions in the reviews, like adding grilled chicken to make it a meal, or using spinach, or dijon mustard.  Very nice recipe!

Hundreds of reviewers can't be wrong.  This was a huge hit when I took it for our big family thanksgiving. I omitted the avocado (no good ones around here), I used D'anjou pears, and I did add the tablespoon of water to help carmelization; my nuts were a bit grainy but I think that was more operator error on my part.  The dressing is indeed delicious and I think the recipe is enough, anymore and the salad would be greasy and heavy.  As is, it adds the perfect flavor.  If you can assemble the salad and dress it (without pecans) a few hours ahead to let flavors blend.  Topped with nuts before serving.  Fiance's family raved all night about it.  I guess I know what I'll be bringing next year.

This was very good. I cut the recipe down to 2 servings since it is just my husband & I. I made extra nuts for next time, I used walnuts, & used 1/4 C sugar per 1/2 C nuts. I also sprayed the wax paper with Pam for easy removal. Following tips, I doubled the dressing but next time I might even triple it. I used pre-crumbled Gorgonzola, because the store was out of pre-crumbled blue cheese. Edit: I made this yesterday & ate the leftovers for lunch today. If you know there is going to be leftovers, omit the avacodo since it gets brown if it sits for too long. I had to pick it out. Otherwise the rest of the salad was fine the next day. This was delicous & it wasn't too much work. I highly recommend this salad. Thanks Michelle!

I made this recipe for my mother's 79th birthday and my picky sons.

They doubted it at first, avacado and blue cheese - "yuck" they said and then tasted it and all loved it!

This is a very easy recipe and I started it the day before by making the pecans and dressing.

This was phenomenally good.  I took it to a potluck, and it was gone in minutes based on good PR from the first people to taste it.  I used a relatively mild Danish Blue, and it was definitely strong enough to contrast with the sweetness of the nuts and pears and the mildness of the avocado.  I found taht the pear got too mushy peeled and cubed, though, and I'm not sure I see a good reason to peel it.  Next time, I probably won't bother.

This recipe is fabulous, but I must admit I do make a few changes.  First, I add only a pinch of salt, rather than a 1/2 tsp, to the dressing - I find 1/2 tsp makes the dressing too salty.  I use a bag of spring mix for the base, I omit the avacadoes and roquefort (my husband and I don't like either), I substitute apples for the pears (pears, since they need ripening, require planning ahead), and I add goat cheese.  The results are delicious!  The goat cheese pairs really well with the dressing, apples, and pecans.  So, after you try the original, try my variation as well - yummy!

This is AMAZING!!  I made it for the first time for a birthday party and everyone had at least seconds...if not thirds!  I few things I did differently (just to save time).  I used baby spinach instead of the leaf lettuce and I used a dijon mustard for the prepared mustard.  It gave the salad another "layer" of flavor.  (Also, I used red pears and didn't peel them!)  I will make this again...just as soon as I finish emailing it to everyone who wanted this recipe!

Very Good! Nice combination of flavors! The only problem I had was in carmelizing the pecans - they stuck to my wax paper, even after chilling in the fridge. Perhaps it would be good to spray the wax paper first with cooking spray. I had a hard time peeling it off of the pecans so I could put them into the salad! Other than that it was a good salad! Will make again.

We made this for a dinner party of 5 people and it was, hands down, delicious. We followed the exact recipe with the exception of the following modifications:

- Used dijon mustard (no grains) from whole foods
- Used gorgonzola cheese instead of blue cheese. I can't tolerate the taste of blue cheese.
- Skipped the avocado. 

Some people mentioned needing to double the dressing. I did this but found it totally unnecessary. We keep the dressing on the side and don't use much.  Half of the recommended would have been sufficient for us.

Someone recommended adding water to the sugar when making the pecans. We did not do this and it came out wonderfully. In other words, I recommend following the recipe.

This was a gigantic hit!  I will absolutely make this again!  I doubled the dressing recipe but did everything else as directed.  I layered the salad as some reviewers recommended, because I was taking it to a dinner party.  It looked beautiful.  Just before serving, I peeled and added the avodado and gently tossed.  I used the Danish blue cheese.  Everyone loved it.

I've made this a few times and always get great compliments. Even my boyfriend, who usually dislikes fruit in salads, enjoyed this one! I use gorgonzola cheese and red onions instead, and used 1 Anjou pear (I like the softness of this pear) for 1 bag of mixed greens (serves ~4). I also doubled the dressing without doubling the oil, and caramelized the pecans with ~2 tablespoons of brown sugar and ~1 tablespoon of water. Haven't had a chance to use avocado but will be making it again soon so we'll see how that tastes!

Amazing recipe. All time favorite. If you don't care for the Caramelized nuts you can skip that step. I sometimes substitute feta cheese and it works perfect as well.

My favorite salad ever!  I use gorgonzola, and it's perfect.  I was a little intimidated by caramelizing the pecans since I'd never done that before, but it was pretty easy.  the first time, I cooked them a bit too long, and few turned dark.  The pears are delicious in the salad.  They can be a bit under-ripe, and no one can tell.  Next time I make it, I'll use romaine lettuce, not leafy lettuce, so it holds up a bit better.  I have made it for parties, and by the end, the lettuce gets pretty limp.

Excellent salad.Although I did not care for the roquefort cheese. It was way too bitter or too tangy. Just not a good fit. I think I would substitute the cheese for feta. Or omit the cheese period.

What a refreshing and filling salad.  I used red onion instead of green onion, added a sliced hard boil egg, and kept everything else the same.  What a wonderful masterpiece. I will be making this again, very soon.  Thank you.

If you can't already tell by the rest of the reviews this salad is a HIT!  It is better than any salad you have ever had, and I'm not exaggerating on that.  I used a smoked bleu cheese as I couldn't find the Roquefort, I left out the avocado out of personal preference  - love avocados, love bleu cheese, don't like them together.  Quick tip for choosing your pears, you want them sweet but crisp, you want the pears to give a little when you press near the stem but not squash down.  I used a whole grain mustard, cause it's sooo good.  Next time I will try this with just toasting the pecans and using stevia in place of the sugar in the dressing for a healthier approach.  Yummy!

This was really good and my family really liked it.  Several days later I discovered that I never put the best part on it, the Gorganzola I had bought!  I can't wait to try it again but with all the ingredients next time.

I've made this for three dinner parties, and it always gets rave reviews!  I normally use the red-skinned pears for more color.  Make sure to double the amount of nuts that you caramelize, because guests and family members will keep sneaking in to eat some before you finish the salad. :)  I use a combo of almonds, walnuts and pecans..they're all good!

Brought this salad to a family picnic last weekend and it was a huge hit! I used spinach for the greens, omitted the avocado (because I was traveling for about an hour to get to the party and I didn't want it to brown) and I waited until right before serving to add the dressing. Everyone raved about it and I had multiple recipe requests. Make this salad, you won't regret it!

What a great salad.  I used gorgonzola, as that is what I had on hand.  I also used already glazed pecans which you can find at Aldi.  The dressing was very good, and I plan to use the dressing again on other salads.  My daughter, who doesn't normally like salads, had a 2nd helping!  Thanks!

This was excellent.  Made exactly except left out avocado.  Served on a big platter with red pear slices spread on top.  Very pretty but next time will add dried cranberries for more color.  Big hit at Easter.

Wow this was good.  This salad with the mustard viniagrette was unbelievable.  The flavors of tangy and sweet was such a nice balance. The only thing I did differently was that I omitted the avocados (Hubby does not like them) and replaced it with a handful of dried cranberries. This will be a favorite on the dinner table.

Make exactly as-is and you will love. I'm a healthy eater but still have a hard time getting excited about salads - except for this one. It's one of those that is just right as written and if you change it up it's just not the same!

I took this to a Super Bowl party and it was a big hit. A fresh foil to all the fat-laden appetizers on the table!

This salad is wonderful. I love the recommendation to make extra pecans, and throw some salt on them right before they're done. It's perfect.   Salad is usually a fresh and decent supporting actor in a meal, but never the star. THIS salad gets Oscar for best lead.

I really like this salad.  As others suggested, I did double the dressing.  It made a little extra but that was okay too.  Just bottled it up to keep in the fridge.  I didn't use a regular roquefort - I had another bleu but it wouldn't really make a difference and like others I did use Dijon mustard.

Pears brown so do them shortly before assembling the salad

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. This is OMG good. People are slightly disgusted if you tell them the ingredients ahead of time, but when they taste it, it quickly becomes the favorite part of the meal. I have made it several times and it travels well as long as you add the nut mixture and dressing right before serving. I haven't met one person who has not asked me for this recipe after tasting it. Try it! You'll astound your friends at what an awesome cook you are!

Really excellent.

I always double both the almonds and the dressing.  I also add a little extra avacodo, and sometimes use both lettuce and baby spinach.
  
Such a fantastic blend of texture and flavor!

well this is just the best and so versatile.  I usually make ahead of time and just put the avocado slices in a container and also the pears slices.  I toss each with a bit of the salad dressing to keep them from browning.  the when ready to serve i put my spring greens in the bowl and cover with the pear slices and avocado slices.  Then i sprinkle with the slivered onions greens and the pecans which i do with honey instead of sugar.  Then I drizzle with the dressing.  I use Stevia in place of the sugar in the dressing!  Plus I add feta instead of the blue cheese as it is too strong and stinky.  Add a sprinkle of dried cranberries and you have one beautiful salad.  thanks Jamie!  This salad rocks!

I tried this salad because it sounded very much like one I tried a few years ago in a fancy restaurant and haven't stopped raving about since... and I'm happy to say it didn't let me down!  I did make a few changes to make it closer to what I remembered: used baby arugula instead of lettuce (Belgian endive would have been nice as well), omitted the avocado, and used grainy Dijon mustard for the dressing. I think this made the difference between 4 stars (how I'm rating this recipe) and 5 stars (how I rated the salad I actually made).

This salad was a hit with my family and friends.  I added some mandarin oranges and dried cranberries.  The dressing and blue cheese added the tanginess to the sweet and it was perfect! YUM.  A definite keeper.

This is the best salad that I have ever tasted!  Instead of using the honey mustard sauce, I tried the salad with T. Marzetti's Poppy Seed dressing and it was so delicious. With the carmelized pecans and the sweet dressing it almost tastes like dessert.

This is probably one of the very best salads I have ever made.  My husband who does not like any of the ingredients said he loved it too.
From the delicious, crunchy pecans to the pears, avacados and the wonderful dressing.  I did not change a thing and it was wonderful.  I did make it as a salad as the recipe calls for and not as pictured.  Delicious.  Thank you.

Tried this for the first time at our dinner party.  The best salad I have ever made.  The dressing sounds simple but is loaded with flavor.  The sweetness of the nuts mixed with pear and blue cheese is awesome.  Definitely will be serving again.

Absolutely fabulous!  I decided rather last-minute to make this salad, so there wasn't time to purchase and ripen fresh pears. I used canned sliced pears (in light syrup)and they worked great!  I also used a package of baby mixed greens, which I thought added more color and nutrition than regular lettuce--and it was easier :-).  I substituted Gorgonzola cheese for the Roquefort, as it's a more mild cheese and I didn't know whether or not my guests liked blue-veined cheese (they don't).  The salad was wonderful with the Gorzonola, but I'll try Roquefort next time.  The combination of flavors and textures was wonderful.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Adding strips of grilled chicken to the salad would make this a perfect summer meal!

One of my favorite recipes from allrecipes.  I have made this three times now and always follow the directions exactly - it is DELICIOUS!  Once I made it for a women's group salad dinner and the bowl was practically licked clean - everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  It is a perfect blend of flavors and textures - definitely earns a permanent place in my recipe file!

Very good salad - always get rave reviews when I make it. 
A little tip is to add a little lemon juice with your pears so they do not brown in the salad.

Awesome recipe.  I've made it twice already in less than 10 days.  I'd never sugar coated pecans before and overcooked it a little.  So make sure you cook on low heat!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I have been looking for something similar to a great salad served at a popular restaurant and this is it....I added fresh red raspberries to make it more like the restaurant version, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  The blue cheese, pecans, and mustard dressing are awesome!  Thanks for a new favorite.

delicious! i doubled the dressing, and had to subsitute almonds for pecans which was fine. i like the ideas others had of adding bacon bits and/or leaving on red peels to add more color at the least.

This is a very good salad. However, I didn't enjoy the pears and avocados.  The second time I used dried cranberries and omitted the avocado.  It was delicious.  I also added pieces of turkey breast to make a quick delicious lunch.  I plan on making this salad for our next Christmas gathering.  I loved it!

Great recipe.  The only things I tend to add or change sometimes is adding cayene pepper to the sugar while candying the pecans/walnuts (I add around half a teaspoon).  I love the spicy sweet taste.  And serve grilled chicken breasts with it for a fabulous gourmet complete lunch (I even season the chicken with a little of the vinagrette before pan-grilling)

I doubled this recipe for a large gathering I went to, about 50 people.  The salad was a tremendous hit.  Many people that I didn't even know came up to me and asked, "Are you the one that brought that salad", (mind you, it was one of about 12 salads).  The recipe was given to many and everyone that took some went back for seconds.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only comment I have is that although some people think that the avocado is gets lost in the salad I must respectfully disagree.  I thought it was a great addition to the salad.

This salad is great!  I made it first without the avocado because of the other reviews, but noticed a definite improvement when I made it with the avocado.  I haven't tried it yet with pears, but apples in it are delicious.  I took it to my small group and after the group several people stood around the salad bowl picking out pieces in the salad - an unusual occurance that says how yummy the salad is!

I've made this so many times and I never need to change a single thing.  I can't say that about many recipes.  Seriously, don't we all change our recipes here and there?  Well, not this one.  No need to change a thing.  Just follow the directions, and you are golden.  

This is now THE salad for Thanksgiving.  Can't serve anything else!  It's that good.  And it's that special.  Now, because it is for Thanksgiving, you might want to omit the avocado because it just doesn't hold up.. Pears do - just soak them in 7UP or Sprite before hand (not water, not lemon juice!)

Okay, so yeah, I do change one thing each time ... I never use wax paper because putting hot nuts on that kind of is asking for trouble.  The wax melts a bit, right?  It's a mess.  Use parchment paper.  The nuts will never stick.  Easy peasy.

Love it and it's always a hit for dinners or potlucks. Sometimes I use red onions instead of green and that works great! Thank you :)

Yum! The recipe was a hit with friends that I entertained last night. 

I doubled all of the ingredients in the dressing except for the olive oil as another reader suggested which I found to be a good move. I added a handful of dried cranberries for color, and mixed in some raw spinach with the lettuce. I do see where you can substitute the roquefort cheese with other blues or gorgonzola, but the roquefort taste was right on. 

Love the taste of the dressing--nice tang from the mustard but not tart like so many vinegary dressings are. Flavors meshed well. I followed another readers suggestion to make the dressing the night before to allow flavors to blend. I also prepared individual ingredients and waited until just before guests' arrival to combine them.

Liked the nuts, but to add a word of caution, when cooking the nuts with the sugar, keep your eye on the pan. When the nuts begin to carmelize, things happen very, very quickly and it's easy for them to burn. 

Looks like it would also be great to take to a party or potluck.

Absolutely perfect as written.  I took this to a pot-luck and of the three salads that were on the buffet table, this is the only one that completely ran out.  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

A delicious combination of fruit, greens and pecans.  Dressing was easy to make and added a lot to the salad.  I used bleu cheese and a spring mix of greens, no onion or garlic. Fun doing the sugared pecans!

Best salad ever.  Served it to 50 people at our local Seniors' Centre weekly lunch 3 weeks ago and people are still raving about it.  I didn't have avocado the second time I made it and given the high fat content of avocados and the fact that I don't believe they added anything to the salad, I'll skip the avocado in future.

Looked great, sounded good, but even keeping the ingredients separate until the get together, it looked awful and didn't taste that great. Hardly anyone tried it! Sad face!!!! Maybe making it on individual plates would be better! I probably won't try it again though. Sorry! My taste is strange- so says my husband!

I LOVE this recipe; this is the best salad I have ever had. My grocery store never has actual roquefort cheese, so I substitute blue cheese.

This is a very easy review to write...YUMMY!!! Best salad I have ever eaten...and I've had some excellent salads! (I left out garlic in dressing b/c I ddin't have any and used very thinly sliced red onion since I forgot green onion. I also reduced sugar on pecans...just a tad!)

Delicious!  I only used just over 1/4 cup sugar on the pecans and they turned out great.  Used gorgonzola cheese.  Didn't need much dressing because the flavors were great just from the salad.  Will make again!

Awesome salad! Brought this to a church potluck and everyone raved about it. The sweet pear, tangy blue cheese, cool avocado, and sugary nuts are a delicious combination and great mix of textures and colors. A great alternative to the spinach/strawberry/poppy seed salad that seems to turn up at every party. Wouldn't change a thing.

Definitely deserves the five stars!   Followed recipe exactly except I used plain blue cheese crumbles, and my guests raved about this salad.  I, too, wondered what could be so great about it, but it is my new favorite!

I have been making this recipe at least once a week.  My family loves it.  I add cucumbers and tomatoes to extend the salad.  The pear has to be very ripe, which can be hard.  But the avocado should not be too soft or it mushes in the salad.

Delicious!  Was much loved at our family christmas party.  The dressing was wonderful--I did double it (although I didn't use quite all of it) and toss right before serving.  I left off the avocado--which might be nice--but it was fine without.

It is currently mid-summer in our country, and I made this salad yesterday for friends.  It was just possibly one of the best salads I have EVER eaten!  I am so glad I doubled the quantity of nuts to prepare, and plan to make it again very soon!  The taste of the cheese, with the pears, avo and nuts, and the wonderful salad dressing, is just too amazing for words!  I did not add water to the nuts, but did spray the wax paper with non-stick spray, which definitely was a good suggestion by someone. As I had sliced red onion on hand, that is what I used iso green onions.  Thanks Michelle for posting it!!

Wonderful salad and it's fun to play around with different combo's although it's very good exactly the way it is.  I have at times substituted shaved asiago cheese for the bleu cheese or even a good goat cheese to give it a tang and a handfull of dried cranberries, in which case I omit the pecans and use roasted walnuts.  I almost always omit the acvocado not because I don't like it, I do, but avocado goes better with citrusy ingredients (IMHO) :-) If I am using walnuts I give my vinegarette a teaspoon on honey to make up for the lost sugar on the pecans.

Australian Review. Fabulous salad. I made it for a BBQ this evening. I used Cos lettuce, Nashi pears and I couldn't get Roquefort so I used Danish Blue Cheese and it was crisp and crunchy and flavoursome and glorious. This is definately one for an adult palate, the adults loved it, the kids did not.

This is the best salad I've ever made.  I ommitted the avocado (as I don't like) and just used Costco half and half salad mix.  It was a huge hit at 2 dinner parties this Holiday Season.  A keeper for sure

OMG, this is good. My sister sent us some Harry and David pears so I was looking for a good way to use some of them. Thanks to her I found this recipe. I did not use the avocado (just a preference), I used 2 teaspoons of sugar in the dressing, and took 16oz top sirloin cubed and seared in blackened seasoning and served over the top of the salad. My husband, mother-in-law, and I made a meal off it. Instead of a head of lettuce, I used a 9 oz. bag of classic romaine salad mix. PERFECT............highly recommend.

This salad was AMAZING! I made it for my mom's birthday and it was a huge hit. It even upstaged the filet mignon. I added applewood smoked bacon to it, but everything else was the same--exceptional salad.

This was an absolutely show stopping salad and easy to make as well.  I did not use the sugar and used an aged balsamic vinegar for the dressing.  I would recommend this to everyone.

This recipe is excellent!

However I made this little switches to fit my taste.
I used Gorgonzola instead of Roquefort (Gorgonzola has a milder taste). I used Dijon mustard instead of prepared mustard.

This is an excellent salad.  Eat it all the time!  However, I always use a poppy seed dressing.  YUM!
Try it with candied walnuts and Gorgonzola.

Yummy.  I have made this salad several times in the past couple weeks.  I actually didn't add the pears since I'm not a big fan of pears.  Instead of Roquefort cheese I used feta, and in place of all the sugar I toasted the nuts with a little spoonful of honey.  Overall a delicious salad.

I made the salad thinking I was going to be disappointed. I am happy to say I was so wrong! This salad is amazing. The second time I made it I did take the advice of some of the other users and omitted the avocado and used red onions. I also used 1/2 the sugar to caramelize the pecans and I added a grilled chicken breast and made it a meal.

This salad had too many flavors going on . My husband and I did not like it at all. I had intended to use this as a Thanksgiving salad this year, so thankful I made it in advance. The salad dressing taste like mustard with oil and vinegar, you would do much better purchasing a high quality red wine vinegar dressing.

Very good.  I didn't really measure the salad ingredients and just used what i had and I added too much of the dressing. Next time I will follow the recipe better and not over-dress the salad.  But even so, it was a hit and delicious flavor combinations!

I had this for the 2nd time last night and it is officially one of my favorite salads. The only things I changed were substituting feta for roquefort since I hate roquefort and I purchased in the salad isle some already candied pecans instead of doing them myself to save time.  Other than that, as follows and it's wonderful!

Love this salad.  I have made it several times and each time it gets better.  I try to balance the dressing to my taste by adding a bit more sugar if needed.  The avacados, although not necessary, are also a good addition.  But the star of the show is the cheese and candied pecans.  Yum!

I think this was a fantastic salad!  I didnt have Roquefort chese so I used Feta. Yummy. 
 My family wasn't crazy about it.  They didn't eat it but it was really good for those who like restaurant quality dinner salads.  
I think it would be great for a ladies night!

Really good!  Like others have mentioned wasn't sure I would care for it, and was very pleasantly surprised.  Used shallots in place of the green onion, romaine instead of leaf lettuce, and a bottled raspberry vinegrette, but kept to the basic principle and would  highly recommend.

Try it! The only modification I really like to do (because I've made this several times) is that I roast a pear, put it in the food processor, then mix it with the dressing. It cuts the calories way down and it's wonderful.

This salad is PHENOMENAL!!! Any time I have made it, even the big 'foodies' in the bunch LOVE it!  If you're short on time I've cheated and used Ken's raspberry walnut vinaigrette dressing instead and it is still delicious.  You may want to mix up some more pecans because they're an especially huge hit!  I have also made it with mandarin oranges (i buy those little cups, not the canned) and substituted instead of pears.  Great for the summer.

This salad is awesome!  I'm so glad I tried this and made it for my sons 1st birthday! I got lots of compliments and didn't even include the pear because they weren't ripe.  I can't wait to make with some ripe pear!

This is an awesome dish! I currently have some food restrictions so I am not allowed to eat lettuce. I used 1/2 pear, 1/2 avocado, and followed the rest to the letter. Mixed the fruit, nuts and cheese in a bowl and drizzled the dressing over the top. It was AWESOME. this is a keeper. can't wait until I can actually have it as a "real" salad. 
Thanks for sharing this!

Got rave reviews on this salad by friends. Don't need to use expensive roquefort, blue cheese is fine. Also added strawberries for color.

I made this for my family's Rosh Hashanah dinner, and everyone loved it. I used a mix of baby spinach and romaine, I used plain pecans instead of caramelizing them, I left out the avocado (this is a high-fat salad already!), and I brought the pears, cheese and dressing in separate containers and added them at the last minute. Super tasty. The dressing is really good with broiled chicken, too.

Instead of using Roquefort cheese, I substituted goat cheese. The flavor of the goat cheese complimented the dressing, pears, and avocado perfectly. This is a favorite!!

Strange, but in Ukranian household one finds a similar recipe though not of much high quality! For example less pears etc. But not odd how the Soviets do so much better.

Fabulous!  Easy and impressive!  I omitted the avocado but would add bacon next time.  Per other reviews I doubled the dressing recipe but definitely didn't need to do so and wouldn't again.

Excellent!  I didn't change a thing.  My five dinner guests last night all requested the recipe.  My attempt to carmelized the pecans was a disaster, however.  I ended up buying some to use.  I'm going to try carmelizing pecans again but next time I'll melt the sugar before adding the pecans and won't put the finished pecans on waxed paper (to which my slightly burnt tasting pecans stuck).  I'll look for a more detailed recipe for the pecans.

This was our salad tonight, Christmas Eve. It was AWESOME and I will be making it again. I used Romaine (personal preference) and doubled the dressing (not the oil, it was fine). My fellow diners didn't want avocado, but I did, so just added some to mine. It might even be my favorite salad (since I can make it at home). If you like these ingredients, you will LOVE this salad. Thank you!

I LOVE this salad.  Perfect balance of sweet and tangy.  I use spring mix salad and Balsamic vinegar instead, and love the flavor.  I made this for a staff luncheon and also Easter brunch and although there were a few who turned their nose up to it because of the blue cheese, but that just left more for the rest of us!  I prefer to toss the ingredients together and add the dressing just before serving, so that it is fresh and the dressing doesn't make anything soggy.

I reviewed this recipe 3 years ago and it is still one of the best salad recipes out there.  It always gets requests and compliments.  I like to add a bit more sugar to my dressing however and find that blue cheese works just as well.  Around the holidays, I like to add dried cranberries for color.  This is a keeper.

This salad is awesome! I added spinach for texture and craisins for color. ***Return review: After making this several times, I decided to reduce the sugar because it make such a mess on my non-stick skillet. Cutting the sugar down by only a couple tablespoons made a huge difference in the clean-up and the pecans (which were still sweet and crunchy, but the crunch was from the pecan, not the caked on sugar).

Just finished eating a huge plate and am so full!!  I am on a salad kick and was looking for something new and now I have a new favorite!  Pecans turned out great but may add cinnamon to the mix next time for something different.  Also substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar as I had none on hand.  Will try red wine vinegar next time for sure!  I also used a gourmet maple mustard (similar to honey mustard) that I think I will stick with.  It is FABULOUS!  I used a spring mix as that is my preference and used a cranberry blue cheese by Rosenborg which worked fantastic with this salad!  I had no avacado but will plan to buy some next time!  As with all my salads, I prepared each plate individually so the fruit and nuts don't get lost on the botton and so those who dislike something (blue cheese, nuts etc..) aren't forced to eat it!  At the end of my huge plate I was expecting a soggy mess, but I was wrong!  Perfect until the last bite...and believe me I savoured every one!!  Thanks for sharing!

This doesn't need any promotion, but it's really great and if you haven't tried it, do so!  I never add the avocado, and use honey to taste instead of the white sugar in the dressing.  I also often just buy a bag of Diamond pecan pie glazed pecans instead of glazing them myself.  I have never served this salad without getting rave reviews and multiple recipe requests.

This is pretty and tasty.  Other than the dressing, it is not necessary to follow the quantities exactly; we used 3.5 oz roquefort since that's the size of the package, and it turned out well.  I didn't have time to make the candied pecans, but look forward to using them next time.

This is BEYOND good!  I have made this for lunch the past two days in a row and plan on having it again tomorrow. I did not have any avocado and although I love it, I did not miss it with all of the wonderful flavors going on. My only additions were to toss in some fresh baby spinach and craisins.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic salad recipe!!!

This was good but I needed to ad more sugar than stated to the dressing.  I agree with some of the other posters..bacon would be a great added on ingreident.  If I make this again I would add it.  I would have rated higher but I did make additions to make it taste better.

This salad was a huge hit at our party.  I tripled the recipe, and substituted crumbled bacon for the avocado.  I also grilled the pears a day in advance.  I tossed the dressing with the lettuce and onions, served it on a large platter, and separately piled the  pears, blue cheese, pecans, and bacon (avocado) around the edge.

Very impressive.  A couple of notes, I did not need to use all of the dressing and still felt the salad was amply covered so you may want to toss with half to check coating and then add the rest.  Also, with the nuts be sure to break them all apart.  If they are clumped at all, they can be quite hard (only had a couple like that though).  I did not use water as other reviewers suggested and didn't have a problem.  Went over very well as a side dish for Easter, and I would make again as an entree for my husband and I.

Amazing!!!!! One of my favorite salads. Everyone that tries it loves it too. When caramelizing the pecans add about 1 TBS of water to the sugar, then when the sugar has melted stir in pecans. Once all the sugar has stuck to the pecans, dump on to wax paper, sprayed with non stick spray. Only one big problem with this salad.....when ever I make it with a nice dinner, I never touch the dinner, I just eat a few bowls of the salad and I'm full!!!!!************* Doesn't keep well either, but that's usually not a problem in my house:)

I did not use the cheese, as I did not have any and used a medium sized box of organic mixed baby greens instead of a head of lettuce. That was a good idea, as I had many varieties of lettuce, and the taste was more varied. I forgot to add the thinly sliced green onions, and it still turned out delicious! And instead of using just three pears, I used a large thinly sliced pear (with the peel intact) and a large thinly sliced Granny Smith apple. Yum yum!

For candied nut mixture, the I changed two things: I added 2 T. of water and used walnuts instead of pecans. 

For the dressing, I added dijon mustard and used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar (I was out).

OMG! This is fantastic! I tweaked it a bit to reduce the sugar, and I used a different combination of wine vinegars to make the dressing more to my liking- after trying the original, of course. This salad would be perfect for entertaining. It's simple, you can make the dressing, coat the nuts, wash the salad greens, etc. ahead of time and just throw everything together before serving. I recommend you use a COLD pear, but leave the cheese out to room temperature.

Great recipe. I used walnuts instead of pecans and subbed walnut oil for the olive oil - just because I had it on hand. I doubled the dressing (but not the oil) as others had suggested and also added pomegranate seeds for color. Served it with Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.

I really liked this salad... I used gorgonzola blue cheese, because thats what i had available... It was good, but i found the flavour a little too strong for my taste. What made me rate this recipe with 5 stars is that my dad, who is the pickiest person I've ever seen, loved it, he even ate my leftovers, something I have NEVER seen him do. I followed the dressing directions as they are on the recipe, but after blending I tasted it and added a little more vinegar and salt. It was just enough for 3 people. I recommend this salad, it is great and will definately get people to ask for more.

There were way too many complicated, competing flavors in this for us.  While we loved the pear and roquefort combination, we felt it would be just as good without avocado, pecans, onion and garlic.

This is the only salad that my husband (a man who once said he was allergic to lettuce!) will eat! It is flavorful! I fixed it for my in-laws' Christmas dinner party last year and it won rave reviews. I like to use either spinach leaves or spring greens mix. Also, don't use a cheese with herbs, because it will overpower the salad - the blue cheese is perfect for it. My husband, who's allergic, uses finely shredded cheddar. We also use the already candied walnuts (in the green container) - surprisingly, the chocolate walnuts are very good with the salad.

This is one of my most favorite recipes ever from allrecipes.  Instead of a head of lettuce I use 3 different kinds of bagged leaf lettuces.  If the crowd isn't small I always double the recipe.  The bowl is empty every time!

Not only is this salad delicous it is also beatiful.  I chopped the lettuce, used iceberg and green leaf, and layered the ingredients on top.  It made for a great presentation.

Pretty good!  This would go nice with a nice glass of white wine.  Next time I think I'll add chicken and make it a dinner.

EXCELLENT!!  I LOVE IT!  what else can I say.  I have prepared the pecans two different ways: with added water like others suggest and without.  I personally think you can stick to the recipe and not use the water.  I found that the pecans actually toasted up better and carmelized.

This was excellent! We couldn't get hold of pecans (i'm not much of a nut fan anyway) so used grilled crispy proscuitto crumbled up to add another flavour / texture. It worked really well! Some suggest leaving out the avocado but I thought it gave a lovely creamy contrast to the tangy cheese, salty ham and sweet crunchy pear. Although for those who don't care for avocado the salad would still be outstanding without it. The dressing was gorgeous, I didn't add the garlic as was having a garlicky main and we didn't miss it at all. Also used less oil in the dressing to cut fat and that was also not missed. Please try this salad it is fantastic!

although it is convenient to substitute another blue cheese, the Roquefort combined with the dressing and pecans  makes this salad unique.  we toss it rather than layer and use Califonia mixed greens.  this salad never fails to be a covered dish hit at parties.

I used many suggestions from previous reviews and this salad was a major hit at my office party. Changes I made: I used romaine and spinach as the greens, I used Gala apples instead of pears, I omitted the avocado, I doubled the caramelized pecans and the dressing, and I added a handful of dried cranberries and pecan-crusted baked chicken. This salad was FANTASTIC. The sharp blue cheese and tangy mustard dressing were a perfect complement to the sweetness of the cranberries, pecans, and apples. The blue cheese can be overpowering, so adjust the quantity to the taste of your guests. I'll definitely be making this salad again!

Definitely company-worthy!  What an excellent salad...  I used apples (instead of pears) and bleu cheese crumbles (instead of roquefort) because I had them on hand.  My husband and I both thought this recipe was just excellent - can't wait to make it again!

wow! five stars for sure. we've had this salad, or some variation of this salad, about 5 times over the past couple of weeks. i would recommend making enough for lunch the next day, too (and enough to share with all your coworkers). if you are making a large amount of this salad, know that it takes a little longer than your average salad to prepare.

Excellent salad!! Everyone raves over this one! Only changes I make are that I cupp the pears into bite size pieces and I toss all ingredients together - instead of layering them.  Great salad and everyone always wants more!

the combo of pear and nuts and cheese  is nice, but the dressing left much to be desired in comparison to other salads i've made from this site. also, i'd add more avocado. my family really enjoyed it, so i'm giving it 4 stars, but i won't make it again.

This salad is wonderful.  I have made it numerous times and everyone asks for more.  The dressing is so versitile.  I did not have all the ingredients to make the salad one day so I impovised and used spring mix greens, goat cheese, mandarins,  and of course the carmalized pecans.  I used the same dressing, and it was another wonderful salad.  The dressing is great.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I first made this salad for a Christmas potluck, where it was a hit! I have continued to make this and modify it slightly each time. It is great with crisp apples, such as Pink Ladys (if you don't have any pears on hand)... walnuts are also wonderful, in place of the pecans... add some thinly sliced grilled chicken for a "main dish"... it's fantastic!

We love this salad! I make it almost everytime we have guests! I omit the avacado because a couple of people don't care for it, but follow the rest of the recipe as written. I use Roquefort cheese, but I think any kind of blue cheese would be just as good. I serve it layered in a glass salad bowl and it is beautiful and elegant to look at, and just delicious. The freshness of the pear, the sharp creaminess of the cheese and the salty crunch of the pecans are a perfect combination. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used blue cheese because I couldn't find roquefort.  I think it tasted a little funny.  I'll try it again with feta.  I really wanted to love it, it seemed like it should taste really good.  I think I just don't like blue cheese.  And the avacado seemed a little out of place to me.  Maybe I'll leave that out like some other reviewers did.

A wonderful combination of flavors!  However, since the presentation may be a little bland with green apples, it might be best to use a tart red or blush apple to add color.

This was SO good! I served it at Thanksgiving and received several comments on it. Due to time constraints, I didn't make the dressing (although I will next time) I used a raspberry hazelnut vinegrette found at the grocery store - it complimented the salad very well. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I tried it at a dinner party, and everyone loved it!  I substituted 3 bags of mixed greens for the lettuce and doubled the salad dressing amount based on other reviews.  It was perfect.  I would definitely make this again and again and again....

I made this salad for my daughter's birthday, and it was a hit!  All I had was apple cider vinegar and I didn't put in the avocado and onions.  It still turned out great.  I thought about using feta cheese, but I knew that pears go great with blue cheese so that's what I used.  
I ran out to the store again and bought more ingredients to make the salad again today.

My best friend thought it tasted bad. i think that came from me putting too much of the roquefort cheese -- I love bleu cheese so I thought more would be better. Once she mentioned the taste, I could taste it too... however, I still liked it. Next time less cheese. Word to the wise, do NOT stick your fingers in melted sugar pecans. It does not turn out good. And it's hard to eat the salad with one hand in a glass of ice water ;)

I liked this recipe alot.  At first when I tasted the dressing alone, I was unsure of it and even thought about making a different one, but once I tried it with the salad, it was a perfect match.  Thanks!  WIll use again.

This is our FAVORITE salad!!!!  I wish I could give it more stars!  I made it with a rib roast the night my husband got home from Baghdad, it's now a regular at our house!!  I don't change a thing except to add more pecans and a little less oil to the dressing.  One other tip - mix the dressing ahead of time to let the flavors combine.

I took a major risk and made this salad for a dinner party without ever having tried it before. My guests raved about it and asked for the recipe! The dressing pulls it all together... but definitely leave out the garlic; it's not necessary. That's the only reason this gets four stars instead of five.

This was an excellent salad that I used as a quick dinner main course for my husband and I. Only change was using a bag of mixed greens instead. Served with garlic bread. My husband loved it. Great flavor and definitely felt like a "meal."

Excellent! Don't change a thing. This is a great combination of flavors. You can use about half the sugar for camelizing the pecans.

This is the best salad I have ever made and is constantly requested in our household.  The dressing is awesome!  My husband doesn't like pears, so we use red grapes instead.  We love avocado but if there isn't one available, the combination of the other ingredients is still full of flavour without it.  Serve this with a BBQ'd steak and it will be a hit.

I served this salad to guests and every last one of them went home with the recipe.  This salad not only tastes good but the presentation is exceptional.  I served it on a large platter instead of a bowl for the full visual effect.  A definite keeper!

Made this recipe for an alternative to the regular pot luck dishes. Was tired of potato and broccoli salad! Replaced the pecan for candied walnuts. Everybody complimented on the taste and it was a hard to please crowd. I also offered a Raspberry-Walnut dressing and that seemed to be a big hit.

Very nice mix of flavors. I preferred to use 1/2 leaf & spring mix:and would do again.  I liked the suggestion of red onion (from reviews) for nicer presentation (and flavor). Dressing was excellent as stated. But, I preferred to add a tsp. of honey, to mellow it out some. I had trouble getting the sugar to liquefy with the pecans. After about 15 minutes, the sugar was starting to just crystallize & get hard. So, I tried adding water, like one reviewer recommended. That didn't help, and only made the pecans soften, instead of the wonderful crunch.  I tripled the amount of nuts(only). So, I suspect that crowding the pan took longer and *slower*, making caramelizing fail.  For tripling, I would higher the heat next time. Due to reviews stating the nuts melted the wax paper, I cooled on a flexible cutting board and that worked well.  To prevent browning, I soaked the cut (I used juicy Anjou) pears AND the avocado in cold water in my salad spinner, with 1/2 a lemon juiced: and then drained well.   Also, tossed the avocado in some of the dressing, before adding to the salad. Neither the pear or the avocado turned brown/dark, even hours later! I used goat cheese (only due to allergies to mold in blue cheese) and was good:made salad very creamy: almost not needing dressing.But, I would of preferred less ounces, as it overpowered a little.  I would like to try tangy Feta next time. These are my 'notes to self', but maybe will help you, too.

I made this salad this evening for myself, my husband, and adult son for dinner.  It was absolutely delicious!! My son ate 3 servings of this salad and my husband and I ate 2 servings!! The combination of flavors is perfection!!  Use any kind of leafy green you have on hand and it will work wonderfully!! I used a bag of romaine lettuce. 

I substituted crumbled feta cheese for blue cheese because that is what I had on hand.  I also substituted diced shallot for the onion/garlic because that is what I had on hand. Along with others I think the dressing needs to be doubled (all but the olive oil-keep it at 1/3 cup).  I used Dijon mustard which was delicious!!  The candied pecans add so much textural flavor along with the sweet pear!! I added a handful of dried cranberries to my personal salad bowl and it was decish!!  My husband and son raved over this salad!! And it is healthy too as well as yummy!! 

Highly recommend!  Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe!! I will be making it again often in the future!!

Love this recipe.  Substituted feta for the Roquefort as I am allergic to it.  Have made it dozens of times.  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious salad and a nice change of pace from the standard green salad. I cut back the mustard (used Dijon) to 1/2 teaspoon. I made one batch of dressing with 1 and 1/2 teaspoons per the recipe, but thought the mustard overpowered an otherwise yummy dressing. Try starting with a lesser amount of the mustard and add more if it suits your taste. Otherwise, this was a winner.

I made this for my husband and me one night for dinner and we both loved it! I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and doubled the dressing but not the oil. I also omitted the avocado as I'm not a huge fan. This is my new favorite salad!

I had to make some modifications because I didn't have mustard or pecans, but overall this salad was delicious. I used cashews instead of pecans and I liked the salad dressing even though it lacked mustard.  I also minced the garlic instead of chopping it.  Next time, I'll try to have all the ingredients on hand.

Really great salad.  The dressing is wonderful.  I omit the onions because I don't care for them.  Be sure to use a crisp pear. Also I used feta, as I am not a fan of blue cheese.  Yumm-o

My favorite salad recipe I keep on-hand, and one of my favorite things to do with good bleu cheese whenever I spring for it. The dressing is also good on plenty of other things, including but not limited to apple salads and pork chops. I've also used walnuts and hazelnuts in place of pecans; the hazelnuts called for some tweaking, but work fine.

I made this for a potluck last week.  It was excellent!  I doubled the recipe but when making the dressing I cut back on the olive oil a little.  I used half Roquefort and half Gorgonzola crumbles so it wouldn't be quite so strong.  No ripe pears around so I used Gala apples.  They were a great substitute.  I did toss in some sliced almonds for fun. Also, use parchment paper to put the hot caramelized pecans on.  They pop right off when cooled.

This salad is amazing! I have made MANY great recipes from this site and have not posted a review because I dind't have anything new to offer from other reviewers. I made this salad for the first time about a month ago. Since its first debut, I have made it over and over again. When I run out of one of the ingredients, I have made it anyway. I now know two things for certain. 1) This salad MUST be eaten with all of the ingredients together. The dressing is amazing and may work on other salads but this particular combination is perfect. 2) This is an addictive food. Please try and eat at your own risk. I seriously can not stop eating it! Love, love, love this salad!

Delicious!  I didn't have pecans but saw the suggestions to substitute walnuts and also the suggestion to add dried cranberries.  I had a package of Dried Cranberry and Glazed Walnut salad topping so I substituted this for the pecans and used walnut oil in lieu of the olive oil.  I pack a salad every day for lunch so the avocado was a little tricky.  Decided to dice avocado into the dressing as oxidation turns the meat brown.  Only lightly brown at lunch.

it sounds funny to rate a salad but I have to say this salad is ridiculous! in a good way.. You will not be able to make this salad and not have every guest ask for the recipe. Blue cheese works fine if you dont have roquefort.

I used arugula for greens and bought pecans that were already candied. Great salad!!!! my finance LOVED it!

Update: I use the dressing from this recipe for all kinds of salads. I made a strawberry, goat cheese, and spinach salad with this dressing tonight and it was amazing. It was also good on a baby lettuce, dried cranberry, and goat cheese salad. YUM!

My husband hates any type of bleu cheese so I used feta instead. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. I could have used a tad bit less dressing, but that's my personal taste.

I was so excited about this salad and I'm disappointed to say I was not impressed. I followed the recipe almost exactly- I increased the amount of pecans and made double the dressing (but didn't use it all). The Roquefort was overpowering and the flavors didn't blend as well as I had thought. I may try it again but modify it.

Pretty excellent. I used walnuts instead of pecans because that was what was in the cupboards. I recommend some salt and pepper, but otherwise a solid dish. We added grilled chicken and made it a meal!

This was interesting.  It is one of those things that you aren't quite sure you are going to like but turns out being delicious.  My husband and I liked it.  Our children did not (they didn't seem to like the dressing).  I did double the dressing per other reviews (doubled everything but the oil) and ended up with too much.  I don't think glazing the pecans is necessary if you are trying to watch your sugar intake but they are rather tasty.

The very best salad EVER!!!!!!   The flavors are amazing.  I'm not a big salad person and I crave this salad often.  The only changes I make are using dijon mustard instead of regular and using purple onion instead of green onion.  You must try this one!

This recipe is a husband pleaser. My guy is lactose intolerant, so I omitted the Roquefort for him, and the salad had enough complexity to withstand the missing  ingredient. Since we had apples and no pears, I coarsely diced, then sauteed three apples until they were tender and slightly browned. When I later tried the pears, my husband insisted I go back to the sauteed apples.

Love this salad.  It is always a hit.  I did as other reviewer advised and added more pecans and sugared them as advised with a little water in the sugar to melt it evenly. I changed the green onion for red for the color and flavor.  Also agree you must do the dressing as directed.  It is perfect that way and other vinegar or mustard substitutes really detract.

I omitted the avacado (husband doesn't care for them) and forgot the green onion (oops!), also I used the store bought glazed walnuts to save time and it was great! My husband doesn't care for pears either but he was willing to try them in the salad, shocker!, and he really enjoyed it. Maybe next time I will add the avacado! When I have more time, I will make the candied pecans because I think they would only make it better! Oh, and I put goat cheese in mine and blue cheese in his, I'm not a blue cheese fan. Again, it was so good!!! Thanks Michelle for a keeper!

Everyone in my book club came back for seconds and we had no leftovers!  I used feta because when I went to the store the only roquefort cheese I saw was $9.  It wasn't until later that I realized I could just buy blue cheese.  Oh, well.  Delicious with feta as well.  Many compliments and lots of happy ladies.

Amazing!  The dressing really completed this one.  I wish I had made extra because I was craving it the next day.  We didn't change a thing.

Lots of incredible tastes! I don't think this needs any kind of dressing. I will leave that out next time. I also thought the pecans were a bit too sweet. I will cut down on the sugar next time. Amazing flavors nevertheless!

My dinner company raved about this salad. I have made it on a few occasions. I did add some garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the candied pecan for a sweet and savory touch. I even make those just as a snack.

When my wife saw me downloading this recipe she said she was going to eat out the night I made it (not a pear fan at all).  I convinced her to stay, and she came back for seconds.  My son who loves blue cheese but hates salad came back for seconds as well.  When we were finished my wife said, "This is the salad we will take when we are asked to bring a salad!"  'nuff said...this is a great recipe.

I really detest salad and went out on a whim to try this one and it is a real winner! Never have I ever gone back for seconds on salad, but you better believe I did with this one. The real star of this is the candied pecans - so good! When you're preparing them, be careful not to let them burn. All of the other flavors work together so nicely. One thing I would change next time is to prep the dressing ahead of time and then strain out the garlic, as I got a few bites that were extremely potent. Otherwise this is a fabulous salad.

I made this salad last night for company and everyone just loved it.  I will definitely make it again.  Only change I made was to use blue cheese instead of roquefort since that is what I had on hand.  One other thing, I might caramelize the sugar first and then add the pecans.

Excellent salad.  I did not peel the pears and that did not hamper the taste or feel at all.  I left out the garlic in the salad dressing because sometimes I find it to be a bit harsh.  I had sugared pecans from another recipe here, Sugar Coated Pecans by Carolyn,  and they were exceptional.  I put the blue cheese on the side as I do not care for it and again that did not detract from the salad.  All in all, a wonderful fresh salad.

Added note:
While I have made this salad occasionally, I make the dressing ALL THE TIME.  I will never purchase bottled dressing again.  I use an aged balsamic vinegar purchased from a olive oil and vinegar store in SF, NM.  I subbed honey for sugar.  The proportions are perfect.  The resulting vinaigrette is to die for.  Again, thanks for sharing.

Wow, this salad was a hit!  I made it for a dinner party and everyone went back for seconds!  So delicious... I would not change a thing about it, and it will be my new go to recipe when I need to bring a dish! 
Just be careful when cooking the nuts and sugar, they will burn very quickly if you don't watch them.

Great taste combo. I substituted spinach for lettuce, and there was
Too much dressing. It was pretty greasy, I'd reduce the olive oil next time.

Beautiful.  I used cashews instead of pecans because I'd only just bought a big bag of cashews.  The red wine vinegar is a bit overpowering for my taste so I'll reduce the amount of that in future.  So many different tastes and textures.  Thanks for the recipe.

made this for xmas dinner. Was a hit! I used crumbled blue cheese, thin sliced purple onions instead of green onions, and bought the ready-to-go candied pecans.  Used blood orange vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. Will make this again.

Out of this world. I more than doubled the salad and doubled the dressing and did not need all the dressing because the pear was so juicy. I think apples could easily be substituted if you cannot get good pears.

Salad was a total hit, even for men and teenagers.  I made extra candied nuts, as suggested, and they all got eaten.  Dressing was perfect, even though it smelled pretty strong on its own.

This. Was. AMAZING. Brought it to a large family dinner and everyone raved about it.  Like someone mentioned, I also substituted red onions for added color/visual interest.  Kept the avocado--it adds a wonderful creaminess.  Also used Boch pears since they tend to be a bit crisper.  The mix of textures and sweet v. tangy flavors creates one of the most flavorful salads of all time.  MAKE THIS.  You won't regret it.

This salad is just as, if not more, delicious as salads I've ordered at 5 star restaurants! The strength of the cheese (I used gorgonzola) works perfectly with the sweetness of the candied pecans and dressing. The avocado adds an extra creamy texture/taste; everything blends together so well! The only thing I did different was omit the green onions.

I loved this salad, for me you can't go wrong with Roquefort anyway. I used my own dressing recipe: small scoop of (quality) mustard, mix vigorously with 1 tbsp of good balsamic vinegar. Then mix that with 1 tbsp EVOO. Add a little salt and pepper. I didn't add the sugar to the pecans and I didn't use green onions. I advise you to add the roquefort after you toss the salad... my husband didn't like how it kind of melted onto everything, but then again he is not a big roquefort fan. I thought it was delish!!!

The dressing was a little tangy for me on all of the bites of salad that didn't have sweet pears or pecans to even things out.  My husband didn't care for the texture of the pecans, but I thought they added a lot to the salad.  All in all, we enjoyed this, but I have often used these topping on lettuce with a different dressing and we like that dressing better.

I made this salad without the avocado and with dijon mustard instead, it was delicious. Everybody like it and requested the recipe. This is going to become one of my fav salads. I mixed all the ingredients and the dressings right before serving.

Excellent!  The dressing is outstanding.  This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I did a mix of different greens including arugula which added a nice element.

I made this yesterday (for the first time) to take to a Thanksgiving dinner.  The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because I thought it was a little too pungent for my taste.  But it is a keeper!  Next time I am going to use a milder cheese such as blue cheese and am going to use my favorite sesame and poppyseed salad dressing, which is actually kind of sweet.  I thought the vinaigrette with the red wine vinegar also added too much acidity and tartness to this otherwise fantastic salad.  I must take partial blame for acidity, however, because after chopping the pears I coated them with lemon juice to prevent discoloration.  I am not sure that was necessary.  I (and my guests) liked the somewhat whimsical idea of the candied pecans; they provided sweetness and a little crunch to this great dish.  The pears and the candied pecans make this a great Thanksgiving/fall dish.  However, that is not going to stop me from making it again and again throughout the rest of the year.

My aunt brought this salad to Christmas Eve as a side. It was such a nice change from all the traditional foods, there were not any leftovers! The pecans totally make the salad, and the dressing is perfect. I don't change a thing about the recipe.

LOVED THIS SALAD! So good and different from standard salads. Couldn't find Roquefort cheese, so I used blue cheese, which was just as good.  Also, since I already had walnuts, I used those instead of pecans, which were just as tasty!

Made exactly as written and 5 star, gourmet worthy.  Carmelizing  the pecans took a couple tries to get right.  No need for added water.  I made the mistake of over cooking them. In the video, the melted sugar is tan, not browned.  As soon as the sugar has melted and the nuts are coated, remove from heat and place on the waxed paper.  Cooking the nuts until they are browned makes them rock hard.  The pecans toughen and are super hard.  They will taste a little burnt when they cool.

FANTASTIC!! I love the flavors in this salad.  I used Dijon mustard, and Truvia instead of sugar.  Also added store bought glazed pecans, since I already had them.  Only used about 2 oz of the blue cheese.  Thought 5 was too much. Also left out garlic as I didn't want to crunch into it raw.  Try throwing in some dried cranberries!  Delicious!  :)

This salad is absolutely wonderful! I had to change it slightly because I did not have all the ingredients on hand (the cheese and pecans - substituted with walnuts and almonds) but it was to die for. Definitely a save!

Yum! the hardest part is not eating all the candied pecans before you make the salad! The only mustard I had on hand was country dijon (the one with the seeds) and it made the dressing pretty zingy - next time I will try it with regular dijon

Im giving this a 4. Not quite a 5 star recipe. But pretty dang good for a salad. I liked the combination of pear and pecan and the tang of the dressing. but me being a carnivore, I thought it should have a little chicken or some kind of meat in it.

I wasn't sure how all of these ingredients would taste, or if they would even go together, but since all of the reviews can't be wrong, I decided to give it a try.  Excellent!  Tastes like it is from a ritzy restaurant.  If you want to impress company, try this salad!  I used Gorgonzola crumbles, and butter lettuce, but want to try the Roquefort next time:)

It was delicious, however, next time I make it, I will not cook the pecans in sugar.  It was already sweet enough without it.

OMG!  I could eat this salad for breakfast, lunch and dinner it is soooo good!  We are  pear and blue cheese lovers anyway, but this total combination is fabulous.  The dressing will be a staple for us from now on.  I tried it on company and everyone mentioned how delicious the salad was.  A real hit and I couldn't be happier with it.  When it gets to be summer I plan to add grilled chicken strips on top for a delicious refreshing meal.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Krista in CA

Very nice dressing.  Made this salad for Easter dinner and it was lovely paired with roasted lamb.  Very fresh and tangy with interesting textures. I will make this again!

This is a keeper!  Well balanced flavors and textures.  I wasn't sure if I should use regular prepared yellow mustard in the dressing - turned out perfectly.  I added some chicken strips to make this a full meal.

Its delicious just as reviewed by all. Roquefort is like $20/lb so I substituted regular blue cheese crumbles. I used a mandolin to julienne the pears which turned out great. Please, please don't use yellow mustard for the dressing, get some kind of Dijon. I used Grey Poupon's course grind which adds a nice texture. Brought it to a potluck and it was definitely a hit!

Exceptional salad. My family is not huge blue cheese eaters so we tried it with crumbly goat cheese and it's to die for.

Awesome! This is a wonderful salad for a special event. However, rather than prepare as a tossed salad, next time I'll arrange the greens on individual plates then add pear slices, pecans and the cheese for an even more elegant flare to it. But the taste is fabulous!

This was a great change for a salad.  I love cheese in a salad.  Even though I could not find any Roquefort I used Danish Blue which to me is the same thing.  Very tangy and a little sweet with the pears and candied pecans.  I used bosc pears.  Very good!

This was great.  I made the dressing pretty much how it says and everyone loved it and I got lots of compliments on it.  As for the rest of the fixings, I did change some things.  I omitted the avacado.  Instead of leaf lettuce I used a combo spinach/mixed greens.  Also used Feta instead of Roquefort because that's what I had.  We also added some Craisens for some color - and it was a good add. Will make this again - and again - and again.

Amazing salad.  I prefer gorgonzola cheese (Trader Joe's is excellent) and I have tried several variations using green apples instead of pears, adding dried cranberries and sometimes including a protein (chopped cooked turkey or chicken) for a complete meal!  I agree, the dressing is good on any salad!

Excellent salad!  My family holidays include "signature" dishes that are only eaten at that holiday.  My one sister always makes swiss green beans, my other sister makes the turkey gravy.  I have been trying for years to find a dish that everyone liked (including school aged nieces and nephews)  I hadn't succeeded until this recipe!!  My family LOVED it and the kids LOVED it I have arrived!! :) (However, I will have to make year round, because it is so yummy)

A super hit at potlucks.  I have added pomegranite seeds for a festive look during the holidays. I agree with some others that the avocado gets lost in the flavors, so I no longer add it.

Very unique salad.  It is a great combination of ingredients.  I give it four stars because I think the flavor of the dressing is a little too strong.  Next time I might try using less mustard.

This was amazing and very easy. I didn't even make my own pecans. I purchased them at the store. I made this for a bunch of men with a steak and salmon dinner and the only thing they were fighting over for seconds was the salad! (the only difference I did was not add avocado, due to my fiance hates them). I will make this all the time!

Excellent salad!  I used hearts of romaine instead of leaf lettuce.  Made the dressing a few hours  ahead of time and kept it in a shaker.  Used dijon mustard instead of regular mustard.  Take dressing out of fridge about 30 minutes before serving so it mixes well. Careful putting the candied pecans on waxed paper as the waxed paper will stick to them.  A cookie sheet sprayed with Pam worked better for me.

Wow.  Like another reviewer said... This is easily the BEST recipe I've tried on Allrecipes.  I used gorganzola cheese instead... My 11 year old son even loved it.   The dressing is delicous.  We dipped our steak in the dressing too.

This is the best salad I have ever eaten.  My husband loved it, too.  I made it for our Christmas dinner and it was a big hit.  Next time I will not peel the pears.  Too hard and takes too much time.  I think it will be just as delicious with the peels!

I used granny smith apples instead of pears, feta cheese(less expensive) and sugared almonds.  I also added cranberries for a sweet zing.  Overall would make this again in a heartbeat

I made this dish to take to a cooking club meetup and it was the hit of the party... even won the prize! I made it exactly as called for and will surely make it again and again! Thank you for such a terrific recipe!

Wonderful!  I made a few changes.  I used baby spinach instead of lettuce, skipped the avocado, and threw in some dried cranberries for color and texture.  The pecans are amazingly tasty in this salad.  Like another reviewer suggested, I added a couple Tbsp. water to the sugar and pecans. I cooked them until almost all the water had dissolved.  The pecans came out with a wonderful sugary coating.  The dressing is perfect.  Just the right ratio of oil and vinegar, and the addition of (dijon) mustard, keeps the dressing emulsified, so it doesn't separate into layers.

Loved it! Even my husband, who said he would pass on this (I made one for him anyway) truly enjoyed it. I used red skin pears and did not peal for some added color. This is a high end restaurant quality recipe. Be sure to serve with a main course that also has bold flavors to balance the entire meal.

Variations work wonderfully! I've tried it just like it is written and with several changes. Both ways it turns out incredible! Chedder cheese, apple-pears, regular toasted pecans, or your favorite lettuce. YUM!

Delicious salad.  I quadrupled the recipe for a 60th birthday and everyone was asking for the recipe.  The blue cheese partially melts to make the dressing creamy.  And the candied pecans are a must!

Loved this recipe!!  I followed the directions and ingredients to a tee, however did not use the wax paper for the toasted pecans.  This just doesn't make any sense.  Think about it hot sugar and nuts on a waxy paper.  Otherwise, everything was perfect and will definitely make again.

Huge hit.  Everyone absolutely loved this.  I used red onions because I prefer them, but other than that did not change a thing.  I will definately make this again.  The avocado is great in this.

A wonderful blend of sweet tastes and crunchy yet creamy textures. The avocado was subtle but it made the salad so enjoyable! I always throw this salad together when trying to impress a loved one. Highly recommended!

I made this for my Bible study group and everyone raved! I used Romaine and mixed greens instead of head lettuce, and I used walnuts instead of pecans. Since the toppings tend to be heavy, be sure to have enough greens to support the rest. This would easily make a meal on its own, it's so filling and delicious!

This salad got rave reviews when I made it. Even the people who don't like blue cheese liked it.  I used bosc pears and dijon mustard to make it.  I followed others' suggestions and added a little water to the pecans and I also doubled the dressing.  Definitely follow the post's instructions to use WAX PAPER to cool the pecans.  Some people complained about the sugar consistency and I believe this is why.  I used aluminum foil the first time and they came out too "candied", not carmelized. I will definately be making this again.

I'd looked forward to trying this salad for a while.  It was quite good, but could have been better if I'd chosen firmer pears and avacado, I think.  As it was, the softer pears and avacado kind of mushed together with the dressing and muted the flavor of the dressing.  Think next time I'd leave out the avacado altogether.  Did double the dressing and was needed.  Didn't candy the pecans for lo-carb appeal and were still good.  All in all, was a nice salad and will try again with nice crisp pears to see how good it can be.

WOW! I've made this a few times now and I wanted to share the success. For the pecans I add to the sugar 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp of cayenne and when they are almost done caramelizing a splash of vanilla. They have more depth with the spice. I have found Ya or Asian pears have a more apple like texture and will travel better then other varieties if you are taking this to a dinner party (which I promise will make you a hero). Everything else is perfect as is. Thanks Michelle

Super good!!! Doubled it to serve 10 adults and 3 small children and it was just the right amount. I used gorgonzola for a more mild blue cheese flavor and did 2 pears since mine were rather large and cut them into matchsticks (julienne style). Doubled all the dressing ingredients except for the oil and when I first tasted the dressing alone, I thought, 'what's all the fuss about? it's just ok' but once you put everything together and the avocados kinda melt into it, it's soooo good! I cheated on the pecans and bought the pecan pie flavored ones cause I was pressed for time, but will try to make them myself next time for sure.I used red onion chopped really small... not the biggest green onion fan. Also added some french fried onions (still leftover from T'giving-trying to use them up!). This salad was a big hit and will definately make again!

This is sooo good!  I could live on this salad.  I use spinach leaves, that's what I usually  have on hand and I think it's healthier.  When I make the nuts, I use walnuts and roast them with 1-2 tsp sugar in a light colored (silver) skillet.  If you use a teflon pan, you won't know when the sugar is browning until it smells burnt and it's too late.  If you use warm walnuts, it enhances the blue cheese.  If you were making for a large group, that wouldn't work, but I can turn this out for a quick lunch just for me.

Loved it!  The only thing I would change is to cut the pears a bit larger, maybe quarter slices.  I chopped and they tended to settle at the bottom.  Christmas crowd loved it and the light flavored dressing (not over dressed like most).

I always like to impress my Christmas guests with a great salad! This salad was..........Fantastic!!!!! First off, everyone wanted to know about the dresing,which was scrumptious! Then, they all wanted to know what was in the salad! I made them guess about the dressing and the ingredients.....I'm so mean!!! It was fun. Everyone went back for seconds. My huge salad bowl was wiped clean with my sister-in-law foaming at the mouth for the recipe.I followed the recipe with these modifications: I used a 5 lettuce blend bag mix from Publix(used 2 bags),used Dijon mustard, and bought Praline caoted pecans. Next time, I'm going to sugar my own pecans! All and all, I felt wonderful impressing my guests! There is no better sound to a lady's ears to hear.......this is so fantastic!! Also, as a side note, even the men loved the salad!! Can't wait to make again. Also. I used Bosc pears!ENJOY EVERY BITE!

This salad is wonderful. I think the salad as written would be great but I made a few changes to suit my tastes or use what I had on hand. I used red onion sliced paper thin instead of the green onion. Gorgonzola instead of Roquefort. Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Here is what I did to keep the pear and avocado from turning brown before serving. I tossed the pears with fresh orange juice before adding them to the salad so that they would keep their color until serving time. I cut the avocado in half, removed the pit sliced the flesh into cubes but did not remove from the skin. I wrapped the halves in plastic wrap with the wrap in contact with the surface of the flesh since the oxidiation starts when air hits the surface. Then I put the wrapped avocado in a good tupperware container to travel.
Just before serving I scooped out the avocado and tossed in the dressing.

If I was served this salad at an upscale restaurant I would gladly part with whatever the cost. I would also return just for this dish. I didn't change or add anything, although I used a suggestion from another reviewer to add about 1 1/2 Tbsp. water to the pecans and sugar as they cooked. It made sense that the pecans would be more evenly crusted by the sugar with this tip. I kept the crumbled roquefort separate so those who don't care for it could leave it out--but it adds an incredible flavour and texture. After enjoying a serving we were lustfully eyeing each other and the remaining salad. I have already purchased ingredients for a repeat this evening. This is one of those "shout it from the rooftops" food experiences!

My boyfriend made this for a nice dinner with friends, and it was probably the most fabulous salad I have ever tasted!  Everyone at the table agreed, and the word has spread about what a great salad this is (he has already had a request to make it next weekend).  The flavors meld together perfectly, and if there was ever a salad that could be described as "melting in your mouth," this is it!

We made no changes to the original recipe, other than to use Salem bleu cheese, because we couldn't find Roquefort.  We used Bosc pears and spicy brown mustard for the dressing.

Excellent. Always a big hit. As suggested, I used dijon mustard in the dressing and a couple of packages of spring mix lettuce.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  Instead of caramelizing the nuts myself, I tried those prepackaged salad fixing things (by the croutons in the produce section) with caramelized pecans or almonds and dried cranberries.  The cranberries add another dimension of flavor that really complements the whole salad.  I also use Dijon mustard, and since I love basalmic vinegar I use that but cut it down a little.  I love this salad and eat TONS of it, even when I'm already full.

Everyone loved the salad.  I omitted the avocado as a reviewer mentioned that they don't travel well.  Also didn't add the garlic to the dressing.

You have to try this salad, even if you're not fond of blue cheese, pears, or avocados! The ingredients blended really well, and everyone loved this salad at Christmas dinner. I followed the advise of other reviewers and added water when carmalizing the pecans, and this worked out well. Yum! I'm making this again tomorrow.

This was great!  I made the dressing and pecans a day early and assembled the salad about an hour early (I used Fruit-Fresh to keep the avocados and pears from browning) on Christmas day.  It was a nice complement to Christmas dinner.

I have made this salad a few times now and it is one of my favorites.
Follow the advice of others and use the red onion for color, and dijon mustard for a little kick, and bosch pears for the best flavor.
I really love advocados so I keep those in there! 
Serve this and your guests will be impressed!

It started out as an experimental salad for a progressive dinner in college. Later, we served it to 500 guests at our wedding (an to this day we get compliments and requests for the recipe!), and last May, we served it to 50 guests for my parents' anniversary party. Each time it was beautiful and delicious!

This salad received rave reviews at my party. It is so different from anything that you normally see served, and the flavors are great. I would suggest NOT dressing the salad until right before. It turned a bit soupy as the dinner went on (or maybe I didn't have enough lettuce to soak it up)? Anyway, a great addition to my dinner spread! Thanks!

This salad is amazing!  I almost didn't carmelize the pecans because I thought it might be too sweet, but I'm glad I did because it was perfect.   I'm already looking forward to eating the salad for lunch tomorrow.

This a fantastic recipe. I don't think I've ever rated anything a five star yet, so for me to do that says alot about my opinion of this salad! It's been a while since I've made it and just this evening I asked my husband what he wanted for dinner and he said, That pear salad!"
Neither of us are very "big on salads", so for us to have this for DINNER is really saying something.

I picked this recipe to try out of the blue & it worked out great! I substituted regular lettuce for more of a spring mix/roughage type lettuce. I also found a blue cheese that had pear in it. Everything combined for a great overall flavour. I recommend doubling the salad dressing recipe.

Oh yes....this is a winner....both my sons-in-law, who despise blue/roquefort cheese loved this salad, and have requested it the last 3 times they've been for dinner. I use blue cheese each time, other than that, no changes and have had nothing but rave reviews all the way around....thanks for a great recipe.

We loved this salad!  It's very similar to a salad I make that has similar ingredients.  I made one change which I felt only improves the salad...instead of sugaring the pecans, I added 1-2 Tbsp of real maple syrup to the dressing.  This added just the right amount of sweetness (it's important to note that I still toasted the nuts, just not with sugar).  Try it...you'll really like it!  In the end, we really liked this salad a lot and will make again for sure.

This is an amazing salad. I get rave reviews whenever I make it, and think about if for days after I've eaten it. 

WONDERFUL!!!

Very good salad, although I did switch a few things.I used the bagged lettuce (spring mix & Romain), used feta cheese instead,and instead of making the dressing, I used a raspberry vinagrette - the dressing totally made the salad.Also dont cook the pecans too long after their done, they get pretty hard.Other wise great salad, although a bit differant from your every day garden salad.

I made this recipe for a party.  I thought it was delicious.  I loved the contrasting flavors.  The only substitution I made was feta for the blue cheese because I knew no one at the party liked blue cheese.  One person said she didn't like it because it was just too weird a combination of flavors, but everyone else complimented the salad.  People loved the candied pecans. I think I may make some more of those and keep them around the house for snacking!  

Note: This salad does not make good leftovers.  I tried it the next day and of course the avocado had turned brown and the dressing had turned a little sour.  I recommend you eat it all when it's fresh!

This was absolutely fantastic! Since fresh pears were not in season, I used a little less than two cans pear chunks (well-drained). Also, I used a bag of lettuce hearts mix rather than a head of regular lettuce.

My family doesn't normally like "specialty" salads, but they loved this one.  Will make it often and share it with everyone.  Thanks!

Totally awesome! My husband and I love this salad. I add grilled chicken on top for a dinner and it's so tasty, perfect for a hot summer meal. The dressing is great on other salads as well. Whenever I make it I usually make double and leave it in the fridge for extra use, it never stays around long.

A delightful salad. One thing I do differently, however, is to only use two pears and add pieces of ripe, sweet honeydew melon and cantaloupe. Yummy!

This salad was pretty good, with a variety of tastes and textures, but we didn't care so much for the vinaigrette.  Perhaps some mayonnaise would tone it down a little...

Oh my goodness this is the best salad I have ever tasted.  Of course I knew it had to be great with the caramelized pecans.  I had two helpings of this and skipped dessert.

Now THIS is my idea of a gourmet salad.  It was easy to put together and tasted great.  I added grilled chicken so I could serve it as dinner, but I probably won't do that again.  This salad is so rich tasting that eating a big plate of it for dinner was a little too much.  I will make it again to be served as a first course or side salad.  I served it on a platter and the presentation was very impressive even though I chopped everything into bite size pieces (unlike the picture above).  Oh, and next time I may leave out the avacado, only because the other flavors were so strong that the avacado kind of got lost anyway.

The first time I made this was for Valentine's Day and it was delicious!  I made some changes though:  serve on spinach, sub balsamic vinegar in the dressing (I love balsamic!!), sub feta (don't care for blue cheese), and sub red onion for a bit of color.  This is a great change from regular salad and so much fancier!!  Thanks!!

Mmmmmmmm! This salad was like heaven in my mouth. I am not a huge fan of pecans but once I had them carmelized, I was stunned by how tasty and crispy they were. I used slightly less sugar for the dressing and for the nuts. Will definitely do this one again!

I really enjoyed this salad.  I added some dried cranberries just to add color.  Everyone enjoyed it.   I did make extra pecans and they keep really well.  Next time I'll make extra dressing just to have in hand too.  Thank you Michelle.

My dinner guests loved this and my husband made it for us the next night. I found glazed pecans at the grocery store, so didn't have to do that step. I also used blue cheese, since that was what I had. Oh and I forgot the green onions. It was fabulous and completely finished!

Let me add my RAVE review for this wonderful recipe! As soon as I tasted it, I said "if I had a restaurant, I would serve this salad." I will serve this again and again.

This salad is absolutely amazing, it is the best salad I've ever had.  For larger crowds I have used feta cheese instead since so many people don't like roqueford, but I prefer the roqueford.  I always have requests to make this salad.

My pears weren't ripe yet and I couldn't wait, so I made this with Gala apples. I have made this salad ~5 times in the past few months. LOVE IT!!!! It is my new favorite, well worth the prep time. SO SO good!!! Thanks! (didn't add onions or avocados)

This is a delicious salad.  I don't like roquefort, so I substituted feta for myself.  Everyone else loved the salad with the roquefort.

Wow! This salad rocks! Each mouthful is so, so yummy! 

Slight alterations:
1. Used a bag of baby spinach for the lettuce. 
2. Didn't have time to carmelize the pecans myself, so I used a package of pre-candied pecans. 
3. Cut everything into small bits to serve it more as a "chopped salad." That way you get the true medley of flavors in every bite.

Since there were only two of us eating dinner, and this was a side dish, there were some leftovers. It was just as tasty the next day ... not as pretty, mind you, because avocado never looks good the next day, but it was just as delicious!

In response to a previous comment...The 1/4 cup sugar is for carmelizing the pecans.  I carmelize a big bag of pecans to keep on hand.  Freeze or refrigerate.  Everyone requests this salad and recipe from me.

California Pizza Kitchen makes a similar salad called "Field Greens" which is one of my favorites.  I agree that the combination of the sweet pears, the tangy blue cheese and the crunchy pecans is delicious.  This is a fantastic salad.  I omit the avacado to cut down on the fat content; I love avacados; I just don't think you need it in this salad.

Everything put together made a pretty good salad. I especially love the pecans. Those were yummy. I wasn't sure what type of flavors I got from the dressing though, but somehow it worked well with the salad. My husband really loves this salad. I used pre-cut and pre-packaged greens, crumbled blue cheese, dijon mustard for the dressing, and nixed out the avocado, garlic, and green onions. Less work. Overall I liked it but there just seemed to be something missing. Some pizzaz. I guess I was expecting the dressing to kick my taste buds a little more. How do I fix that? More sweet? More tang(y)? I'll probably use a little less olive oil next time too.

This salad was a great hit.  Guests left wiith the recipe in hand.  I thought the avocado adds a nice touch and makes it different than other cheese/pear salads.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this salad and so does everyone who tastes it.  I use two avocados instead of one, because I like avocados, and I use store bought butter toffee almonds and packaged salad greens to save time.  There is never any salad left at the end of dinner.

Incredibly delicious salad.  Everyone devoured it, including the picky one that hates bleu cheese.  I did substitute Gorgonzola for the Roquefort because it is much milder, but I used all the other ingredients in this recipe and it was fabulous and so easy to make.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this many times. The dressing is wonderful, I used apples, Feta cheese, and plain pecans. I thought that the caramelized pecans were too sweet. Green apples and Gala apples are good in this. I left out the avocado because I don't like it. I LOVE this dressing!

Excellent salad. Loved the pecans, maybe next time I will add some more sugar because I increased the amount of pecans and they didn't seem sweet enough. The avocado didn't seem to add anything so next time I will forgo it. Used crumbled blue cheese.

I made this great salad for New Years Day for 45 people.
It looked fantastic in a large white dish, tasted glorious and was finished within 5 minutes.  I would not change a thing.  All the ingredients together compliment each other.

Very gourmet, tasty and colorful.  Used red leaf lettuce and put the walnuts on parchment paper to avoid them from sticking.****  After making this many times now and not altering it in anyway( it's perfect the way it is), my Mother wants to take it to a potluck but she is scared to as she claims to have almost broken her tooth on a caramelized pecan!!! (well that's my Mom)  So she wanted me to buy her pecans and not caramelize them.  I saw some honey roasted mixed nuts in the bulk food section (pecans included in the mix), told her to chop them into smaller pieces and she said it went very well!  (Still wouldn't change a thing for myself)

Yes- it's an excellent salad.  I found that 1/4c sugar was enough to coat nearly a whole cup of pecans, which is fine since you can store them and use them for another salad later (this is probably the most time-consuming step anyway).  I omitted green onions.

I made this salad for our Thanksgiving dinner ths year.  It was perfect for that type of dinner.  I used canned pears because the pears here are not in season right now.  The carmelized pecans make the dish!  What a great combination between the blue cheese, the avocados, the pears, and the scallions.  I would highly recommenda this salad to anyone!

Made this for a sit-down party of 40 people -- it was the first thing that went.  I didn't have parchment paper to avoid the pecans from sticking as some reviewers suggested so I used a nonstick baking sheet to cool them on. The pecans slid right off.  Don't skimp on the avocados as some suggested, their creaminess complements the crispness of the pears so all the ingredients blend beautifully.

I decided to make this salad for company as I wanted to make something different.  This just disappeared.  Everyone loved it.  I did make sure to spray the wax paper with cooking spray so the nuts would not stick to it.  I also made the dressing the night before to cut down on my time in the kitchen the day of my party.  I wasn't to sure about the dressing by itself but on the salad it was great.  The dressing really pulled all of the flavors together nicely.  Will be keeping this recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.

The salad was good - I liked the combination of ingredients.  Unfortunately, we didn't care for the dressing.  I mixed it up & tasted it before pouring it on.  We decided to skip it and just used a raspberry vinaigrette that we had on hand instead (which was a nice combination with the salad).  The dressing was high on garlic flavor with not much else and I couldn't picture the garlic going well with the sweetness of pears and caramelized pecans.

I must join in on the praises of this salad.  I fixed this salad followed the recipe but made one change I candied the pecans using Splenda instead of sugar.  Also served the roquefort on the side because of guest preferences.  My friend loved this salad proclaiming she ate the leftovers the next morning for breakfast.  Plan on fixing this salad for lunch today.
Another thing to note I used bagged salad mix about 1 1/4 pounds instead of head lettuce speeding up the process a bit.

A delicious salad ~ I've made it as is, with romaine lettuce and red onion instead of lettuce and green onion.  Both ways taste great!  This is now a regular at our table!  Thanks!

This recipe is excellent!  Both my husband and I loved it and actually crave it!  My husband is not a roquefort cheese fan(I used blue cheese actually) but he said it was the perfect blend of flavors and ate every bite!  Love the avocados in it too!

I made this for a fall festival. Everyone loved it!  I added a teaspoon of good quality maple extract and used brown sugar instead of white for the dressing.  I didn’t bother doing anything with the pecans. I subbed finely chopped red onion for the green and reduced the quantity by half. I added about 1/3 cup craisins to make up for the lack of sweetened pecans. They added a nice pop of color!

My family enjoyed this salad however instead of pears, green apples will make the salad more tart-y, sugar on the pecans is unneccessary. I added some sweat grapes to it and the balance of sweetness and tart

I now understand why this recipe has had so many 5-star reviews.  It's simply divine, and one of the best salads I've had in a long, long time!  Followed the recipe to the letter except for using Dijon mustard, instead of the regular yellow prepared mustard.  You get layer upon layer of fresh and bright flavor, every single ingredient complements the other (without one dominating), the dressing on its own is awesome, and those caramelized pecans just take it over the top.  The next time this salad makes a repeat performance in this house it'll have grilled & chilled shrimp, perfect for a summer main course salad.  This one's heading into my Favorites folder.

I made this for dinner tonight and there was hardly any left! I used romaine lettuce,gorgonzola cheese and red onion for color. I doubled the recipe for the dressing, used Dijon mustard per previous reviews  but put a squirt of yellow mustard in it to sharpen the taste up a little and then added a little more sugar to make it barely sweet. This helped to blend the flavors in the dressing. One extra tip is that you can never have too many of the caramelized pecans. I will make this again.

I couldn't get enough of this salad.  I taste tested it before I brought it to a potluck and then "taste tested" a 2nd helping.  I used Feta instead of Blue Cheese, left out the avocado and used white onions since I had them on hand.  The salad dressing is the bomb.  This is a nice palette cleansing salad and not a heavy mayo based salad.  Great balance for a meal that has a lot heavy dishes (like Thanksgiving).

So easy and so good!!!  Have made this with and without the avocado.  Still good.  I always use a different cheese (not a fan of blue or gamey cheeses).  Another reviewer mentioned adding a teaspoon or two of water to the nut process - which really makes them foolproof too.  GREAT SALAD.

This is easily one of the tastiest salads I have ever made.  My man actually commented on it after I packed it in his work lunch.  A rare happening.  As typical, I have followed the recipe verbatim.  It was my first time doing the candied nuts.  Was amazed how quick and simple it was.  Made me feel like a chef. :)  Will make this again and again.  The dressing is very nice tasting.  Use good quality olive oil.

I have made this salad three times since saving it around Easter...it's a keeper.  The only change I made was using gorgonzola and pre-packaged candied candied pecans.  I caramelized my own on the first go-round and then opted for simplicity. All of my family (8-82) loved this one.  I used the leftover dressing (not a huge fan of over dressing a salad) to marinate porkchops the next day, also very good!

The salad ingredients worked very well together.  The raw garlic ruined the dressing.

I didn't try the final product because the pecans got burnt and the pears weren't very tasty, but the dressing was too vinegary and odd for my tastes.

Oh my goodness. This is the best salad ever. No, really. If you think it sounds iffy, just give it a try. You'll have it twice this week, I promise. The only slight tweaks I might recommend would be dijon mustard (normal yellow is a teensy bit overpowering for the vinaigrette), and we like to use maple syrup to carmelize the nuts, but it's still good with the plain white sugar too. Thanks for the recipe - AMAZING!!!!

My favorite salad!  This is a major crowd pleaser.  I've taken it to lots of group functions and everyone enjoys it just as much as I do.  I think the mustard dressing is a great compliment and it is something I never would have thought of myself. Thanks for sharing!

This was soooo good! I couldn't find Roquefort so i substituted it with a regular blue cheese and it turned out wonderful. It's true what the others say about the candied pecans - you need to make extra! I COULD NOT keep myself from munching on those while they were cooling!!!

Very good salad! I almost followed it to a "t". My modifications were substituting 1/4 red onion because I didn't have green onions on hand, 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar instead of 3, used 1/2 tsp. lemon juice to pour over avocado to prevent from browning (that is the reason why I cut down on red wine vinegar otherwise it would've been too acidic) and used Dijon mustard to replace prepared mustard. My husband and I were quite pleased with the result! This is a keeper..! Thank you Michelle for sharing

This salad is fabulous!  I have made this several times.  I stuck to the instructions from the recipe to add pecans and sugar in the pan (no water) and they turned out perfect.  I brought this to a fancy dinner party and everyone loved it.

Served this at a family gathering and everyone went for seconds BEFORE I even had a chance to serve the main course! It was a hit - and probably the best raves I received from my hubby who said it was Chef quality!   I did burn the pecans and sugar just a bit - so I will second a previous recommendation to add 1 1/2 tablespoons of water when sauteing the sugar and pecans.  LOVED IT!!

Just made this and it is likely my favorite salad - followed the directions exactly except that I used almonds instead of pecans, and they were delicious! After making the caramelized nuts, I let them cool overnight and then crushed them (easier on the teeth).  I also soaked the cut up onions overnight in water to take out some of their potency (I'm very sensitive to raw onion).

Everyone loved this salad!!! Used three different types of pears just to try it...no could taste the difference so guess it doesn't matter what kind you use...

I just tried this recipe and used the following edits;
- no avocado
- used dijon mustard
- doubled the dressing (next time, I would only use 1.5 of the dressing recipe because it was too oily for just one bunch of leafy lettuce --or add more lettuce!)
It was sooo good.  In the ingredients list and title of this recipe, it refers to Roquefort Cheese.  I didn't know it was blue cheese and couldn't find it.  Eventually I did with the help of someone at Loblaws.  Another hint is do not add water.  Amazingly enough, the heat just melted the sugar without any liquids.  Just be sure to be around to stir it, so it doesn't burn...like mine did!

I added balsamic vinegar to my dressing I would suggest substituting red wine vinegar for balsamic. I also substituted the roquefort cheese for goat cheese. Excellent salad!!!!

Fabulously delicious/ a real crowd pleaser.  I found candied pecans in a bag in the baking aisle at Walmart which were so yummy and relieved my fear of messing up that part.  I also use whichever greens look the best at the store (spring mix w/spinach was great last time).

Everyone loved this!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using gorgonzola instead of blue since it's a bit milder, and chopped red onions instead of green.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making this again.

phenominal salad! this has awesome flavor. i used feta cheese (and added a little extra because we love it) so that flavor along with the sweet pear & candied pecans was so good! the dressing was a perfect compliment. when i made this the second time, i used fresh spinach instead of lettuce, and i think that version was even better. next time i will try a mix of both spinach and lettuce. either way, my husband nearly cleans the bowl before anyone else can get any! absolutely a salad worth making on a regular basis!

My new favorite salad! Creamy, tangy and delicious!! You have to try it! I substitute goat cheese for the blue cheese as I am not a huge fan of blue cheese. However it is still awesome with the blue cheese.

I already had my own balsamic vinegarette on hand/used that as the dressing but did the rest as written....excellent. The sweet candied nuts paired with the tangy blue cheese really make this

Perfection! I've made this salad at least 7 or 8 times now and I always get rave reviews. My only suggestion would be to add the pears at the last minute because otherwise they turn a little brown.

Oh my! I really didn't think this salad could live up to the reviews, but it absolutely did!  This is the first time I've ever made homemade dressing but it certainly won't be the last now that I have this awesomely simple recipe.

My one tip: I am not familiar with/couldn't find "prepared mustard" at my regular grocery, so I went with simple ground mustard, which worked perfectly fine.

This is by far the best salad ever!  I get rave reviews no matter the company! The leftovers (if any) always go home with others!  You can change to danish blue cheese if necessary (all I had on hand a few times) .... the dressing is incredible!!!  I cannot say enough about this salad!!  AMAZING!

Delicious! There's enough dressing if you toss the salad. If you want each person to dress their own, you'll need to double or triple the recipe. Watch the nuts closely so they don't burn. We also used about half the Gorgonzola.

Excellent!!  I substituted Romaine lettuce as that was all I had on hand.  Because I'm trying to cut back on sugar, I just added plain pecans instead of making them candied, and it was still excellent!!!

I have made this four times since I found the recipe and it is always raved about.  I didn't make any changes - and wouldn't.  YUMMY!!

I used blue cheese instead of Roquefort because I'm not a huge fan, but WOW.  Probably the best salad I've ever tasted and the best part was the I made it!!  (i.e. it was VERY easy).  Will most likely make again and again.

Great salad!  Only one problem, at least for our family.  We found it so filling (maybe because we ate so much of it) that a main entree was unnecessary.  Next time I'll serve it with a light soup, lots of toasted french bread and butter and a nice dessert.

Definitely a 5 star!!!!!  Is Chris' review from 5/2010 a joke!!!!! How can you give a 5 star rating to an original recipe when you have changed 80 per cent of the recipe, then say your changes "it doesn't matter". How can you be so arrogant. Your recipe changes prove your level of culinary finesse is 0 (that would be zero). I would have thrown your recipe into the garbage disposal.

I really enjoyed this salad.  I think, for 6 servings, you should double the dressing and pecans because both are so delicious, but there's not quite enough of either to go around.  I also used red onion because that's what I had and I omitted the avocado.  Wonderful recipe!!

Wonderful as written.  However, not being a fan of roquefort, I substituted gorgonzola and candied pecans for walnut allergies...just as delicious!  We make the dressing for all our salads now.

This is my go to recipe to wow guests.  One change I make is to candy the pecans with sugar and generous amounts of pumpkin pie spice.  It really adds some zing.

Great recipe! I didn't have time to make the dressing so I mixed 1 t of Dijon mustard with 1 t maple syrup (read somewhere it's healthier than honey as a sweetener). Then I add some Italian dressing I already had made up to the mixture and voila!

Yum! Followed this recipe almost exactly except for the bleu cheese.  Some of us are not bleu cheese fans, so next time I will omit the cheese and eat person can sprinkle either bleu cheese or feta on their salad individually.

This is my new favorite salad.  In a pinch I used store-bought candied pecans and vinaigrette, and it was DEVOURED very quickly by a very discerning group of guests.  I like it with bib lettuce best.  Spend the money on the best Roquefort you can find: you'll be glad you did.

Wow!  This was soo good!  Glad I made extra pecans because I kept sneaking bites while I waited for dinner to finish.  Doubled the dressing only because it didn't look like enough and I love dressing.  :) Next time I will make 1 serving and it will be plenty for 2-4 as a side dish. Hoping the 2 servings I made tonight will hold over until lunch tomorrow.  Would make a great dinner all on it's own.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this the last 2 Christmas dinners.  I thought it was best layered on the plate.  I then let everyone drizzle their amount of dressing.  I made 1 1/2 times the pecans.  Don't overcook the pecans -- just let the sugar melt then remove them onto the parchment paper.  Will keep this as a favorite for the holidays!

I prepared this salad for our wine tasting group and it was devoured.  I used gorgonzola instead of roquefort because I needed to use what I had.  I will make this again and probably again.  I am looking forward to using roquefort in order to taste the difference.

This is an amazing salad!  I served at a dinner party with only 2 changes:  I used red onion in place of the green onion, and I used Girard's Light Champagne salad dressing.  My guests LOVED this recipes, and so did I!

This is great and as promised, everyone asked for the recipe!  Just make sure you make enough, everyone ate thier entire salad.  I used Dijon and left out the avocado and green onions.  I am going to use just a little thinly sliced red onion next time.

Love this salad and so do my friends. I took it to a potluck New Years Eve party. I changed it just a little. One of my friends is allergic to garlic so I omitted it. Omitted the avocado (couldn't find a ripe one). Used walnuts instead of pecans and dijon mustard. Everyone commented on how delicious it was. Thank you so much for sharing this Michelle.

I thought this salad was excellent.  I was a little nervous about the mustard vinegarette dressing, but was surprised at how mild it was and how well it brought out the flavors of the rest of the salad.  It didn't overpower at all.  This is definetly a keeper.

AMAZING ... in looks (great for entertaining) and taste (the blend of flavors is delicious)!  Some changes: I substituted the lettuce with a baby arugula blend, omitted the avocado, and added crumbled bacon. I am really glad I heeded the warning of another reviewer on here and didn't go with the balsamic vinegar on hand when making the dressing, because the dressing does really pull the salad together as is (although the caution is the recipe doesn't make enough dressing).  All in all, this doesn't disappoint.

Fantastic!  I was skeptical at first because I did not like the taste of the vinagrette but when tossed with the salad, it is a great combination.  I will prepare this recipe again.

Delicious and beautiful salad. Pears and blue cheese are a great combination. I used spring mix instead of leaf lettuce. I added pomegrante seeds for color; also used purple onion instead of scallions. For the dressing, I used Splenda instead of sugar. I also used Splenda-sugar mix to candy the pecans -- an experiment but it worked (you need to add a little liquid to get it to carmelize).

We LOVE this recipe. Even when I tell my family that we're having salad with dinner, my kids ask if it's the "candy nut" salad. I tried the recipe the way it's originally written, but have since decided to omit the avacado. It not necessary. Also, make the dressing the way it's written, but rarely have to use the entire batch. It keeps, though.    ps. remember to buy your pears a couple of days ahead. Often the stores won't have ripe ones available the day you want to make it.

This salad is spectacular! I used dry mustard and added almonds. I served this to 22 Italians in Italy for their 1st Thanksgiving and there was none left! That says alot considering salad in Italy consists of lettuce, tomato, oil and venegar! WOW... I will make this again!

I made this for a large family gathering and the compliments didn't end till we walked out the door to go home!   I made the recipe exactly as written. I think next time I will try the balsamic vinegar to give it a little zing for the taste buds. (I like things with a little bit of kick)

Used walnuts instead of pecans, thanks to my fiance eating them before I could use them. I used 3 romaine hearts, a large can of pears. I don't like avocado or green onions so I omitted them.

I served this to my friends who are not huge fans of salad and they really liked it. The blend of avocado, pear and the dressing worked really well. When I originally made the dressing I found it to be a little too mustardy for my taste, so I would cut back on the mustard and maybe add a bit more sugar.

This salad is excellent. Go mild with the blue cheese if you put too much it takes away from all the other wonderful flavors! I substituted toasted slivered almonds and sweetened cranberries for candied pecans because I didn't have any pecans. Loved the taste!

I make this salad everytime I go somewhere or have groups of people over. It's fantastic. I use balsamic instead of red wine vinegar (because I always forget to buy red wine vinegar) and it still turns out fabulous. I add extra avocado because it's a nice contrast to the crunchy pear. Great for any occasion!

Fabulous recipe!  Definitely one of the best I've tried on the site.  I substituted walnuts for pecans and figs for pears because I didn't have either and it still tasted super.  I would follow the advice of one of the other reviewers and add water to the sugar for the caramelised nuts.

I started to make my typical salad and then decided to make this, so I had some mushrooms, tomatoes, and onion slices already in my salad.  I then added the avocado, pears, chopped candied pecans, and blue cheese.  I topped with the dressing. All I can say is "WOW!"  The flavor combos here are amazing.  The pecans with the pears creates a totally different flavor than the avocado and blue cheese (what a great combo) so every bite is different.  If you like strong flavors this is the salad for you.  If you like subtle flavors I doubt you would like this much. Thank you so much, I look forward to making this at Thanksgiving (the dressing would be great with an apple style salad as well I think.) This is just fantastic!

Excellent salad.  Regarding carmelizing the pecans, I tried it both ways, with and without adding water to the sugar.  If you add water, the sugar becomes dry and tasteless, but the pecans are separate and remain soft.  If you carmelize the sugar first, meaning melting it over high heat until it becomes amber-colored, then add the pecans and immediately pour out onto waxed paper and separate the pecans, you get declicious, crunchy candies instead of dry, flakey mush.

This is a marvelous, luscious salad with a combination of strong flavors to appeal to an adult palate.  I made the salad for just my husband and myself, but I will certainly want to show-off with it the next time we have guests.  The strong flavors from the roquefort, vinegar, the mustard, and pears (or apples) sparkle together and they are accentuated by the carmelized pecans.  Then, the creamy texture of the Roquefort and the avocado contrast with the crunchiness of the pears and pecans.       I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I substituted Granny Smith Apples for the pears because I could not find ripe pears and did not want to have to wait for pears to ripen.  I liked the addition of the winey, cruchy apples, but I am anxious to try pears next time.  I used three avocados instead of only one.  The extra avocados add a mellow flavor that contrasts with the other strong, sharp flavors. I will certainly use it repeatedly.        Just a hint:  people who like this recipe should also try the "Spinach and Goat Cheese Salad with Beetroot Vineigrette" recipe that can be found on this site. It has somewhat similar combination of strong flavors set against the sweetness of carmelized nuts.

Everyone loved this salad. I thought the carmelized pecans were too sugary & hard, so I just use toasted or plain if I'm short on time. I agree that the amount of dressing should be doubled. I like to have it on hand. It's yummy!

Yummy salad. After reading the reviews, I doubled the dressing recipe and used most of it.  Used Bosc pears (sweeter),  dijon mustard and bleu cheese. When cooking pecans, be patient.  Keep heat down or they will burn.  Sugar takes a little time to melt and carmelize. Light, interesting flavors and textures.  Great salad for a dinner party.  Prepare all the elements ahead of time and keep them separate.  When ready, layer as directed and serve.

Made this with feta because I'm not a big blue cheese fan, other than that stayed true to the recipe.  Found it tricky to get the nuts evenly coated with no hard chunks sticking to them- might have to work on my technique.  I brought this salad to a dinner with several guests and everyone asked for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent salad!!!!  My sister made this last night and it was delicious.  I made it again today but had to modify it slightly based on what I had in the house (apples and almonds)  but it still was delicious.  I plan on making this quite often.

My mom makes something like this, and this recipe seemed very close.  I took it to a military social function and everyone raved, and also thought I was some sort of foodie.  I used Annie's Organic Yellow Mustard and it was a bit overpowering (to me).  I think next time I'll halve it.

Delicious!!!  My husband proclaimed this to be his favorite salad to date!  We used Danish Bleu cheese instead of Roquefort, and only used a 1/4 cup of olive oil to keep it a bit lighter and it came out divine.  A definite keeper!

Delicious salad!  I used bosc pears and thinly sliced vidalia onion instead of green onion. I omitted the avocado as I just didnt have it and did not put any sugar in the dressing.  For the pecans- I tried spraying the wax paper with PAM, but found they were still starting to stick so I transferred them to the plastic tupperware that I was going to store them in anyway - Worked much better!

i modified it the second time around so that it was easier.  i didn't peel the pear, nor did i carmelize the pecans.  i also didn't have green onions.  but i did have grilled chicken ... amazingly good.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My only suggestion is to wait until the last minute to add the pears. Once I added the pears, the lettuce wilted and made for a mushy salad. I also used candied pecans instead of making my own to save a little time. 
The recipe is also really great made with baby spinach. A little more hearty and healthy. :)

This was a perfect start to our Christmas dinner! YUMMY!! Everything was perfect.  I would not leave out the avocado as many suggested, I really thought that pulled it all together.  I did sub Gorgonzola for the Roquefort because my hubby is not a huge Blue Cheese fan.  He LOVED it!  The dressing was just delicious.  Perfect amount for the 2 bags of baby spring mix that I used.  I used a high quality olive oil that was infused with garlic and I can tell you everyone was licking their plates.  Thanks for such a great salad.

Perfect start to our Christmas dinner which also included the beef tenderloin with shallots from this site. I changed nothing in either recipe, and my efforts were rewarded with repeated compliments. The salad is probably the most unique and delicious salad I've ever made.

Wow, I am totally shocked by how many outstanding reviews I got on this salad!!  I made it for Thanksgiving and people raved about it more than anything else.  Even my uncle who is a chef said he wanted to add it to his restaurant menu!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I tossed a handful of pomegranate seeds on top for some color because the salad is all pretty green.  :)

Oh my, how good is this. I only changed the cheese. My grocer was out of Roquefort and I used gorgonzola. Supurb, that is what I say. After makeing the recipe as directed I also added crumbles after dressing my salad. To live for, not die for. Yes, yes, yes, and many thanks.

Great recipe. I always get great reviews every time I make this recipe. Roquefort cheese is usually unavailable, so I use Gorgonzola cheese instead. Other than that...I follow the recipe exactly as written!

SO GOOD!  I couldn't stop eating the pecans when they were done.  I had to use red onion rather than green but cut it paper thin.  The dressing was good but a little too tart for us.  I used gorgonzola rather than Roquefort as that is what I had on hand.     I will make again but maybe with a little less vinegar.  Thanks!

This recipe is worth 10 stars! The average cook may be a little intimidated by the diversity of ingredients and how well they will combine, but the salad is divine! Every ingredient keeps its own distinct flavour, and yet the result is greatly balanced! I followed the recipe, apart from using pecans (not available)-substituted them with almonds. TRY IT NOW! A hint: Leave nothing out - everything is important!

I've made this salad several times and receive compliments every time I make it.  I've used blue cheese, Roquefort, and Gorgonzola, but have found Gorgonzola to be the best.  Follow the rest or the recipe to the "T" and it is D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!

Very good, I love any salad with nuts and fruit.  I use blue cheese in place of the roquefort and also added almonds along with the pecans.

My Goodness! Is a 5 star rating all that is allowed? This is the best salad I have ever eaten. I will never lose this recipe! Thank you for this extra, extra special salad.

this salad is fabulous! it has been said before, but the combination of textures and flavors is fantastic! I have made this for a few parties and I am always asked for a copy of the recipe.
personally, I prefer to use a grainy artisan-type mustard and a little extra sugar in the dressing.
bon apétit!

I had  never "craved" a particular salad recipe until discovering and trying this one.  I follow the recipe exactly.  It is absolutely delicious!

i like this better without the avocado.  followed someone's advice and doubled the dressing ingredients (except for the oil and salt).  this is one of my top favorite meals when grilled chicken is added.

I made this for a coworker's baby shower, which meant I assembled or cut everything the night before and only saved the pears and avocado for the day of the party.  It was good, but I guess I was expecting more.  I doubled the dressing like everyone recommended and while I got compliments for the salad, one person complained about too much garlic.

This was a delicious salad and was very easy to make! I left out the avocado and green onions because I didn't have them on hand, but it still turned out great! A tip for the pecans... add a drop of water to the pan to help dissolve the sugar faster to prevent clumping. With a little more sugar and some cinnamon, the pecans are a great snack on their own! Thanks for a great recipe!

I subsituted the pecans because all I had on hand were almonds. It tasty for the most part, but something about the dressing I didn't care for. I might try and tweak that a bit, but I love the other ingredients together.

Update - I used dijon mustard instead of regular and that seemed to fix the off flavor for me. I also like to add some chopped red onion and use baby romaine lettuce.

This really is terrific!
There are a few different opinions on the sugar & pecans but it works fine as the recipe reads.  You do not need to add liquid to the sugar, it will melt once hot enough.  
I doubled the pecans/sugar(they're so good!) & doubled the dressing just in case people wanted extra.

Made this for a girl's night. Everyone went back 3 times! I usually am hesitant at trying new salads, but this one was really a winner. I didn't add water when carmelizing the peacans and it turned out well. Just be careful if you have oil heat.

This salad is FANTASTIC! It's even better than my favorite salad from my local gourmet restaurant. Double the dressing and serve it on the side. Don't mix in the avocado. Sprinkle it on top at the last minute so it doesn't brown. I will make this salad many more times! I love it!

Wow, wow, wow!!  This was absolutely perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it for a party and everyone couldn't stop raving about it.  I did make the dressing a day before which I think made it taste even better, but it completely isn't necessary.  I just did it to save me a step on the day I was serving it.

This is a wonderful and different salad, impressive and special, but easy to do. I made it for Christmas following the recipe exactly (huge hit!), then experimented with feta cheese another time. But the mix of flavors was less interesting with the feta! I am sticking with the Roquefort.

Absolutely delicious!! I made this last night for my anniversary dinner and my husband LOVED it (as did I)!! I used pre packaged carmelized walnuts from Whole Foods to cut down on the preparation and they worked perfectly!! I will make this again.

When a good friend handed me a copy of this recipe and told me that this salad was to die for, She was right....what a stimulation to the taste buds...nutty, sweet, tangy. This is definitely one I would serve to dinner guests. Very special!
Honestly,  if I had seen the grams of fat BEFORE I made and ate it, I wouldn't have........32 grams of fat?? no wonder it was soooo good!!!

If only it were possible to give 10 stars! Excellent as is, or can sub gorgonzola for blue cheese, and peaches instead of pears. 

Make a little extra dressing, marinate chicken breasts, grill. Just slice and serve on top of the salad and you've got a perfect meal.

Not a fan of blue cheese so I mixed in everything but.  Turned out to be ok - nothing to write home about.  I think even with the blue cheese, this salad would still be the same.  Will continue to enjoy a lemon poppy seed dressing fr this site until i find something better.

This is simply the best salad I've ever made.  I made one change; I found the carmelized pecans too sweet the first time I made it so the second time I merely toasted the pecans and WOW, perfection was achieved!  Also, the second time I made it I didn't have red wine vinegar so I took a chance and used balsamic ...it worked very well, and so provides you with an option.

This salad is RIDICULOUSLY GOOD.  I was looking for an unusual salad and ended making this twice in 4 days.  No adjustments necessary -- perfect as is.  And no waiting until you get to the bottom to get all the goodies -- plenty of goodies to go around. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  Awesome.

I made this for Christmas and the whole family loved it. The children even loved it... I used blue cheese and feta cheese. I used the Prepared Mustard and I am happy that I used that because the salad was tangy, sweet and spicy.. Thank you for this great salad.. I plan on making it for Christmas next year...

I don't know what happened here, but I was terribly disappointed in this dressing. I brought this to holiday dinner and it was barely touched (I was pretty embarrassed...) I loved all the other salad ingredients and make other dressings all the time but the dressing lacked a good bite and was bland. I used yellow and stone ground mustard.  If I were to use these salad ingrediants again I would find a different dressing--maybe balsamic.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit with everyone! I used crumbled goat cheese instead and used my own version of candied pecans (1 egg white beaten until stiff then add 1/2 c brown sugar, tsp vanilla, cinnamon if desired, toss in nuts and bake at 275 for 10-15 min).

FANTASTIC.  My FAVORITE SALAD EVER!!! My sweetie and I have made it twice in about 3 days and we can't stop eating it.  I did modify the recipe somewhat, I did not carmelize, just roasted the pecans and I used artificial sweetner in the dressing to cut down on sugar intake.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and intend to make it again this year because it was very popular. I used 1& 1/2 bags of pre-packaged salad greens, a good blue cheese, and I followed another reviewer's suggestion of adding 2 TBLSP water to the sugar and pecan mixture.Excellent recipe!

This salad is wonderful as everyone before me has said. I used another pecan recipe that I found on this site, Pecan-Snack. 
its so easy and really was great with the salad. I added dried cranberries and doubled the dressing. I plan on using this recipe for Thanksgiving.

This salad was a huge hit at my cookout. I used freshly grown local lettuce. I also subbed gorgonzola for roquefort which is the basically the same blue cheese, from Italy.

A great salad!!
However, with such a high calorie content I wouldn't make it again for a side salad.  Next time I will cook up some chicken and add it so that the salad can be a whole meal.

This salad was really good and went over very well with our company. The only things I changed were almonds instead of the pecans and added some cinnamon to the sugar I coated them with. Mmmm. The dressing is delicious.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. Made it for a baby shower and everyone wanted the recipe.  The bosc pears adds sweetness to the tangy mustard sauce and the avocadoes just does wonders to it.  I did add some water to the sugar to prevent burning.  I used spiced mustard instead and it worked well.

I thought this salad was really good!  I added an extra clove of garlic, and doubled the pecans.  And I used goat cheese in my salad, since I don't like blue cheese, but I kept the blue cheese in my husband's salad--he loved it the recipe too!  We will definitely be making this again!

WOW! This salad is one of the best salad I have ever had! My whole family, including my meat-lover husband and father loved the dish. Some changes that I made: I used bananas instead of avocado (learnt that from Asian De Cuba), used crumbled gorgonzola cheese, omitted the mustard & used balsamic vinegar since I don't have them on hand, and chopped the pears to mix it with the salad.  This salad idea is fantastic!  Thank you!

Excellent salad, especially the dressing.  Loved the texture combinations (avocado, caramelized pecans) and the green onions were superb.  Would recommend using crumbled cheese if blue isn't your thing.

Well worth the effort.  This salad travels quite well, if you make the pecans and dressing in advance, and chop and assemble at your destination.

Incredible salad! The dressing is so refreshing and compliments the salad perfectly. When I caramelized the pecans the sugar crystalized on them. I added the tablespoon of water as one reviewer suggested. This has happened to me in the past.  We just to used toasted pecans instead. Thanks for sharing this really wonderful recipe.

This is THE BEST salad I have ever made!  I haven't even had anything this good at a 5 star restaurant; most definately a feature dish and makes more than enough for 4 people.  I bought really fresh ingredients and perfectly ripe pears. Serve with a chilled fruity white wine.  :)  I also have made it with a light almond crusted halibut recipe on the side. I made it for my boyfriend twice and he loved it and asked me when I'm going to make it again.  You have to try this!!!

Wow! Wow! Wow! Even if you hate blue cheese... WOW! Best salad ever hands down. There should be a 6/5 stars option just for this one... we use mellow blue cheese instead though!

This was fantastic! I substituted gorgonzola and apples for the roquefort and pears, but it was still great. The dressing is really good too.

This is an astonishing salad.  It is rich enough to be a meal.  I used spinach, brown sugar, and dijon mustard.  I recommend letting the carmelized pecans cool almost to hardening before placing them on the wax paper.

This salad is fantastic!  I just made it for lunch becuase my husband doesn't like pears or avocados.  Well, I have eaten half of it myself already.  I don't know if there will be any leftovers.  The sweet  pear is a perfect blend with the creamy avocado, crunchy nuts and tangy vinaigrette.

Delicious! I serve this when ever I get a chance. I've gotten great reviews from parties where I've taken this. Even the kids who didnt like salad loved it. I like to change the type of vinegar and mustard I use to change the taste up. Basalmic vinegar and cabernet mustard make a good combination.

I love this salad. It had been added to my personal recipe book and my husband loves it too. I add a bit more olive oil and sometimes omit the pears. What a refreshing salad.

I used Romaine lettuce as it had a lovier texture and taste.  Didn't have good fresh pears so used canned. (although will definately try fresh pears when they are in season.  Used Asiago cheese as it was what I had on hand.  Even with these changes it was really good.  The kids liked it and had seconds.  Great recipe!

Execellent recipe and really quite simple.  The blend of all the different flavors is so good  - an impressive salad for company, too!  I would not recommend bringing it to a potluck or picnic because the pears and avocadoes do not travel well...but I will definitely make again!!!

Very good, and I'm not a fan of salads OR bleu cheeses. One IMORTANT comment. There is a mistake in the directions. It says to use 1/4 cup of sugar, and that isn't right!

This recipe was a big hit.  I doubled, or maybe tripled, the avocado, which was delicious.  I used spinach instead of lettuce, to add more nutrition and a deeper flavor.  Also, I skipped the onions.  I now make this quite often.

I fed this to a large group of skeptics for Easter lunch and not one lettuce leaf was left!  The dressing is tangy...the combination of blue cheese and pear is wonderful (and I never would have believed it!).  I used a bag of mixed greens, one pear (I wasn't sure it would be well received), and used blue cheese because that's all I could find in my little bitty town.  Wonderful and pretty...will serve many times in the future.

This was very good.  It's something you can serve at a dinner party and be proud of it.  One note, I added a little bit of water (1/8 cup) to the sugar to make sure it dissolved.  I didn't have confidence that sugar would melt (I left it on there for awhile, I was afraid it would burn first).  The dressing is yummy!

This recipe came out great.  I didn't have the roquefort so I substituted gorgonzola cheese.  I don't really like mustard and when I first tasted the dressing I was afraid I wouldn't like it, but when mixed with the other salad ingredients it was really great.

I made this for my family as part of Thanksgiving dinner and they loved it!  I couldn't find Roquefort exactly, so I used blue cheese and it was great.  I would highly recommend this salad!

Very good and different. All I can say is watch after melting the sugar with the pecans, Don't touch until it is cool.  It will BURN you. I know I did it!

Made this recipe for a dinner date with friends and everyone was ooing and ahhing, including me!  One said, "this tastes like it was freshly made at a 5 star restaurant."  The cheese and the avocado offsets the sweet perfectly.  The dressing is fantastic too!

Although it did take quite a while to prepare, it was an amazing salad.  I'm always trying to find salad that I like because I want to get more fruits and vegetables in my diet, and this one tastes great.  I will definitely make it again, but I will allow myself plenty of preparation time.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  My husband and I like to use pears in salads when tomatoes aren’t in season and this was perfect. I’m lazy so, instead of making pralines, I bought a praline mix at the bulk store.  Also, I’m not mad about blue cheese so I replaced it with Cambozola, which we thought worked really well.  Finally, my avocado was a tad too ripe for nice dicing so I just threw the good bits in with the rest of the dressing ingredients and whirred it all together.  A keeper!

I made this for a  luncheon with the girlfriends, and we all loved it! I made more of the dressing as recommended in several reviews, by increasing all the ingredients except the olive oil and salt, used red onions instead of green, and cut down a bit on the sugar used to caramelize the pecans.  No need to peel the pears.  So good!

Notice that almost all the reviews were for group events meaning the salad was eaten after it was made. This salad does not keep well. The pears turn brown and wilt  the lettuce turning into a soggy mess.  However it is very good if and I mean if you eat it right away

Y’all, this salad is awesome! I was definitely not expecting to love it as much I did. I served this on Christmas, and it was a huge hit with my family. I made the dressing a day in advance to save time, and I really think it helped the flavors develop. The combination of flavors and textures just work so well together.

My guests absolutely loved this - everyone had seconds, and there wasn't a salad leaf or a crumble left of the salad when we finished. First time making, pretty easy. Ripe Bartlett pears (not  too soft though) are your best pear to use here. Other than 3 pears might be too many (I only used 2), follow the recipe exactly, and you will be thrilled.

I have made this with blue cheese and with goat cheese and we much prefer the goat cheese.  Blue cheese overwhelms the salad but goat cheese is just the right contrast.  We love this salad.  I leave the avocado out, one family member is allergic to it but it's just great without it.

This was a big hit with everyone. I didn't have roquefort cheese so I used gorgonzola.  I also used thin slices of red onion to add color instead of the green onions.   I will definitely be making this again.

Great salad but I thought the dressing was a little tart. I added some pear Gorgonzola dressing that I found at Vons to the dressing in the recipe and it was fantastic! Got rave reviews both times I made it:). Used Stilton cheese and candied pecans...yum

I made it exactly as the recipe is written.  It was incredible.  I took it to my brother's house and they loved it too.  Will make it again, but will cut it in half.  Too much for 4 people with a main course and it isn't good as a left over.

I made it for a dinner party for my mom's birthday using pears from our tree.  It was a big hit! My husband said it was the best salad he'd ever had!  All the different ingredients and textures make it so delicious . We loved it so much we are making it again this weekend.  I think we will be enjoying this salad for many years.  I've already shared it with others. Yum

Every time I have a party someone will ask if I made "that" salad. People LOVE this salad. I'm not a blue cheese lover but I still use it and eat around it. Everyone raves about this salad. Can do lot's of the prep the day before. Worth the effort!

Everyone liked it! I forgot the green onions, but Looking back... I’m not sure it fit. Also (full confession) I cheated and bought some candies pecans instead of making them! Pears and avocados are unpredictable if not ripe when you buy them. I doctored the pears because they were in the unready side. (I microwaved them with sugar a sprinkle of salt and a touch of honey after they were chopped) they were still a bit boring but what can you do I had an event to bring to!! As for the avocados, the host had some that were ripe, so I traded.

I didn’t have a lot of the ingredients so I only used this recipe as a guide to make my own salad. I used apples instead of peas, sliced almonds instead of walnuts, feta cheese instead of blue cheese and I left the spinach out. My family loved it! Next time I’ll try it with the original ingredients

Try using baby spinach to amp up the flavors another notch! You can make it with caramelized crushed walnuts as well.

I balked at the thought of having to caramelize pecans, but the results were so good, I even "held back a few" to snack on for later.  I added a teaspoon of water as it was taking forever for the sugar to melt.  Once it gets going, keep a close watch as it quickly can turn to the burnt sugar stage! It is the crispy sweet pecans and soft pears that go so well together in this salad.  I found the ratio of vinegar a bit high, so will cut back to just  2Tablespoons or else use a good quality balsamic vinegar, which is sweeter and less tart.  For 4 dinner guest servings, I bought an organic hydroponic head of butter lettuce, broke it into 4 equal quarters, and flattened each portion on individual salad plates.  Sprinkle on the green onion, pears, lay a fan of avocado slices, crumble the cheese and pecans and top, and drizzle with the dressing.

Made this for my husband (who is picky but likes bleu cheese) and I, and he loved it!!!  He loved the dressing which I served on the side, and the pears.  Great combination of flavors and textures.  I would make this for a nice dinner for company (if they like bleu cheese).

Heads up! It was very good; however, the salad greens in the picture are not the iceberg lettuce mentioned in the recipe. I have a bias against iceburg, so I used mixed greens, which is at least much closer, if not identical, to what was used in the picture.

This was a terrific salad!  Used a block of good bleu cheese (not the tasteless crumbled) and just chunked it myself.  The  milder flavor of the avocado, although delicious, almost got lost and could be left out if in a pinch.  Thanks for the great addition to my recipe book.

Changed cheese to goat cheese just because of picky eaters.  It was excellent, got rave reviews.  Would love to try with the Roquefort.  I bet that would be yummy too.

The dressing is great. I didn’t put the avocado in. It seems overkill. Also, I plate the salad individually instead of putting it in a serving bowl. My guests loved it.

Made this for a potluck and got rave reviews! Forgot to add the green onions but it didn’t seem to matter. One problem was cooling the pecans. The recipe says to cool on a paper towel. I did this and they stuck to the paper towel. I was able to salvage about half. Next time I’ll use a strainer.

Everyone loved it! I didn’t have an avocado, but it still turned out great. As mentioned in another review, to caramelize the pecans, add in the water to ensure it will not burn. It was quick and easy!

This is delicious!  I made this for my book club last night.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Dijon mustard as another reviewer recommended.  It was devoured.  Everyone talked about what a delicious salad it was & wanted the recipe.  Use every ingredient, don't leave anything out.  It melds for a perfect salad.

I had to make some substitutes for this.  I couldn't find the cheese, and didn't get home with the pears.  I used apples and fresh parmesan cheese.  It tasted great despite the changes.  I will be making this again soon. I didn't like the way the sugar was clumped on the pecans, so maybe I had my fire up too hot?  I will start super slow and low on that next time around. It is a very nice fall season salad.

I feel like I made something gourmet. I'm not sure I did the pecans correctly, as they stuck to the wax paper even after I allowed them to cool. My husband doesn't like bleu cheese, so I used feta instead. Delicious. Will make again.

I have been making this salad for years and still love it. Sometimes I substitute gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, both are yummy.

Excellent. Doubled the dressing. Recommend  using 6 oz of good evoo to 4 oz of red wine vinegar. Gives the dressing more snap and the extra acidity the vinegar provides is magic with the blue cheese. Use red onion instead of green. Avocado unnecessary. Would recommend doubling the blue cheese or roquefort  to 11 oz. or so. Pralines were a nice accoutrement. Also added 2 lbs of chicken tenderloins for protein. Super yummy

This salad is a perfect summer treat! Tangy vinaigrette, bright blue cheese, sweet pecans and pears make this salad taste restaurant fancy. I used a blush wine ready made salad dressing and added a tablespoon of table mustard.  I also made the candies pecans myself. All I have to say about that is dangerous! I may have eaten more than a few while preparing the salad. A  recipe I’ll definitely make again!

Everyone I have made this for has loved it. I've made it exactly as written, and have also made it with some changes, only because I didn't have the ingredient on hand. I've subbed feta for the cheese, subbed almonds for the pecans, and subbed spinach for the lettuce. Doesn't matter, it's always delicious. The dressing is perfect! Thank you!

Was a hit at Easter.  Wasn’t sure whether to use yellow or Dijon mustard, so I went with the Dijon.  Dressing came out great.  Will definitely make again.

Great, versatile recipe.  Made the dressing with Dijon mustard because I don't like yellow mustard. The dressing is the star!!!  Great base recipe that can be tweaked to what you like or what you have on hand. I've made it with red onion instead of green, spinach instead of lettuce, thrown in some craisins, made it with avocado and without (just because I was out), and I've used store bought honey roasted pecans and plain toasted pecans.  I like blue cheese crumbles, but you could certainly use feta instead as well. The one thing I wouldn't change or substitute is the pear.  I think they are texturally perfect for this salad.

Delicious! I served it at a dinner party everyone asked for seconds. I did substitute the Roquefort with feta and the pecans with walnuts. The tangy sweetness of the dressing and pears was perfect with the salty cheese and crunchy candied nuts. Definitely will be making this again!

This was really fresh and delicious!  My guests loved it and I will certainly make it again.  Candied pecans which were easy to prepare , the avocado, and the dressing set this type of pear/Roquefort salad miles ahead of the average tasty sweet green salad!

This is a fantastic salad, absolutely delicious. The hardest part was caramelizing the Pecans next time I will but already caramelized ones.

Great recipe! I've tried the original and a few variations, and can say that I prefer the changes I made. 1) I really like this recipe with spinach or leaf, but have found that a little added romain helps with texture/crunch. 2) I've used several types of blue cheese and have found that Humbolt Fog is the best of all worlds- if you love blue cheese, you like it. If you hate blue cheese, you like it. I've also used goat cheese before and have had great reviews. 3) I've made this recipe both with and without avocado- it truly depends on the ripeness and quality of avocado. I feel like only perfect fruits should be used. 4) Lastly, I've primarily used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar because I prefer the taste/slight sweetness of good balsamic.        I have to add that I hate it when people give a high rating, but change some of the key part; however, this is a perfect recipe to play a little with personal preference. It's such a yummy salad with whatever variation you choose. I highly recommend.

This salad is perfect if you can sit and eat immediately for a small gathering or yourself. The pears obviously brown quickly though. So when I’m making it for a potluck or social gathering I substitute pomegranate seeds. It is amazing and festive looking

I did make 2 changes. I added a little cayenne pepper and salt to the sugar in the candied pecans. Also, I added 1-2 Tbsp of honey to the dressing. It seemed to make it more balanced. With these changes, it was delicious!

This salad has too much going on for me. I'd lose the cheese and the nuts. Half of my Thanksgiving guests wouldn't even try it so it went to waste.

A big hit at a pot luck dinner, and the most popular dish at Thanksgiving dinner two years in a row.  I use blue cheese, and much less dressing than the recipe makes.

usually being the baker in my family.... I felt a bit out of my comfort zone when asked to prepare a salad for Thanksgiving dinner. I made this salad, and wow! IT was a HIT! so thanks for recipe!!!  I made two large bowls for 17 people, and it was all gone. I used arugula lettuce.

Great recipe! Made this for thanksgiving and it got eaten very quickly! My only suggestions based on other reviews are to double the salad dressing amount, as well as double (or even triple in the case of my family) the amount of nuts (I used walnuts instead of pecans). For the nuts, I only used 2 tablespoons of sugar for 3/4 cups of walnuts with about 1 tablespoon of water and the nuts turned out sweet enough for my taste. I also used about 3/4 cup of chopped red onion instead of the green onion. I might add some cranberries as well next time for more color and even more flavor, but overall a very delicious salad!

Made this for Thanksgiving and received rave reviews. I did nake some changes based on ingredients I had on hand. I used spring mix lettuce with red onion & gorgonzola. The dressing is tangy & sweet. Delicious.

Delicious salad for a dinner party - my guests loved it.  Because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand I made a few substitutions - I used gorgonzola cheese, substituted balsamic expresso vinegar for the red wine vinegar and used thinly sliced red onion instead of green onion.  This salad was a hit and I'll make it again.

This is awesome.  I used only 3/4 tsp mustard based on other reviews and I didn't go through the trouble of caramelizing the pecans.   Everyone loved it.

I loved  this and so did my dinner party! I made it exactly except substituted honey for sugar in the dressing and did the pecans with maple syrup they were unbelievable. Just because I don't to sugar.  The honey mustard dressing is wonderful and I will use it regularly very easy to whip up .  I also added chopped dates and crispy prosciutto .  I could eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner and I just might .

The first time I made it, I didn't have enough lettuce & I burned the pecans (had to remake it), but salad was good.  The second time I made it (yesterday), I still burned the pecans and seemed to have to much red vinegar in dressing...I will definitely continue making this salad b/c it does taste good.  It's just this cook messing things up :)  Anyone have ideas on how to caramelize the pecans so they don't burn?  Also, how to keep the wax paper from sticking to the pecans when you try to break them apart??  Thanks in advance :)

Best salad ever. I've had similar salads at high end restaurants. I'm so happy to be able to make it at home now. My husband loved it too and he's not a big salad eater. The flavors and textures blend perfectly. The first time I made it the store did not have any ripe pears so I used apples and that was wonderful. Loved the crispness of the Apple. The second time I used a very ripe pear and it seemed to get lost amongst the other flavors and was a little soggy. I actually prefer this salad exactly as written except with apple. And I also added some craisins (dried cranberries)which was delicious too.  Thank you!

You can use about half the sugar in the pecans. Add a splash of lemon juice over the cut pears. I usually leave out the onion and it is still amazing! People actually told me this is the best salad they have ever had!

Delicious dressing. Used almonds and walnuts instead. Pairs well with the quinoa vegetable muffins.

So very tasty! I made it for our Easter dinner. Everyone loved the combination of pear and blue cheese. A perfect combo! I will make this quite often now.

Doubled the sugar/nuts (walnuts because that's all I had) and over-caramelized them (too hard for some people).  Only used 2 pears and 1 head of lettuce.  Also doubled the dressing.  Next time, I will use more lettuce.  Next time I will use the full amount of pears, and I will try candying the pecans (using the top rated recipe from this site) instead of caramelizing them.

Yes, I used fresh homade cranberry dressing! No cheese.  Two types of pears, large Bartlet pear and a small Bartlet-type pear! I sliced them in quarters and laid them opposite each other in alternating positions, forming a "star" pattern!  Dotted the pears with the cranberry sauce, then spooned dots of sour cream on each pear slice and sprinkled with crushed pecans!  Yum,Yum!  Very refreshing taste!

Very tasty and was a big hit.  Next time I would add more lettuce and less dressing as it was overall a little too sweet.

Incredibly excellent salad.  I didn't have avocado or green onion.  Everything else same as recipe.  This salad was all gone first from a large buffet of food.  I had seconds and I just couldn't believe how wonderful it was.  Make this salad you will be glad you did!

I made it just as the recipe sugggested except that I used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had in the pantry. Everyone loved it!  It's the first time that I made a salad that was completely consumed.  I usually have to throw away a little bit because you can't really save a salad after it's dressed.  However, everybody had seconds.  My husband didn't think he would like the candied nuts on top, but he mentioned several times how much he liked them.

Great dressing !  I bought the "candied pecans" at Trader Joe's to save time.  Next time, I'll toss the greens with the dressing then proceed with layering, just because I think tossed salads always taste better ;)

I made twice this for my bunco group and they devoured it! I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I purchased candied nuts because I'm lazy and I used good Gorgonzola cheese crumbles after consulting with a cheese expert at my local gourmet store.  Some reviewers suggested doubling the dressing.  This was not necessary for me. The combination of these tastes is amazing - the creaminess of the avocado combined with the crisp pear and the texture of the cheese, etc.  It just works!
note to self: 6 cups torn Romaine lettuce =1 head (I usually buy the bagged Romaine lettuce for quicker prep)

I could eat this salad for all three meals it is so amazing. It is my go-to bring-along to parties. I always double the dressing measurements and have, from time to time, used a variety of nuts to candy. I also recommend keeping the pears and avocado separate until you're serving it to reduce browning time. This is an all-time favorite All Recipes selection for me.

I made this for a July 4th party. it was a huge success, many people asked for the recipe.
However, it did take a bit longer to prepare than I had expected; about 90 mins...
But again, it was a huge success!

I LOVE this recipe and so did all the people that I fed it to! The pear and the nuts really make it pop, but the dressing is SUPERB! I made it twice in a week! I made it as is and it's great, of course, but if you wanted to add say, jicama or radish or whatever, I don't think it would detract from it, but it definitely doesn't need anything else. Thanks for this one!

This salad is incredible!  The most difficult part was finding pears and an avocado that were perfectly ripe and ready to cut into. You need to think about that in advance.  I will absolutely be making this one again.

This salad is so yummy!!! I omitted the avocado, as it didn't seem to mesh with the other ingredients. I only used one pear, and I used a mandolin to slice it very thin. Personally, I think 3 pears is too much because they cover the entire salad. I followed the rest of the recipe as stated. The dressing was excellent too. Thank you.

I made it just as the recipe is written and loved it.  The sweet pear and spicy mustard are great together. The caramelized pecans topped it off perfectly.  I did use a different blue cheese it was gorgonzola not Roquefort.  Will make again.

This salad is EXCEPTIONAL. I would give it ten stars if I could. I'm not really an avocado or even a fan of pears.  I didn't have "true" Roquefort and substituted Blue cheese from the grocery store. I doubled the dressing because I like dressing. Instead of tossing the salad with dressing, I let guests put on the amount they preferred.  The second time I made it, I added bacon bits from a bag. If I ever add bacon again, I'll add crumbled bacon that I cooked myself. I really didn't care for the bacon bit texture but it tasted fine in the salad. If making for the first time, follow it exactly. I did read the comments about adding some water (1-2 Tblspns) to the sugar, after the fact. That would have helped tremendously!!  First time making it? Follow it exactly, then tweak and make it your own. A true keeper . Thank you Michelle K for posting this recipe.

Made this salad for a family party and it was a big hit.  I make this at home all the time and triple the dressing so I always have some on hand.  Most times I'll sub red onions for green, but the salad definitely benefits from onion one way or another.

i am giving the 5 stars to the dressing, because i did not try the whoe salad yet. the weather was really warm the last 2 days and i just felt like a nice good salad and i found this recipe. i used the same exact recipe for the vinaigrette dressing, and used leafy greens, strawberries and apples, sadly i had no nuts :( will definitely try this again and again and again! i loved all the combination! question: anyone tried making the dressing in a large quantity and have it handy in the fridge??

Do not change a thing! This recipe was delicious just the way it is written. I made it for Christmas dinner, just to have something different, and the only thing on the table completely gone at the end of dinner was this salad. Even my mother in law liked it. It sounds like a lot of odd things to put together, but somehow they are perfect together. This is my new "go to" salad dish. I think I might try it in the warmer months as a main dish, throw on a little chicken?

This is an excellent salad! My boyfriend doesn't care for bleu cheese so we made this using goat cheese and it's still incredible! We also used spinach and arugula mix instead of lettuce. I omitted the sugar and garlic from the dressing and just mixed red wine vinegar, evoo and Dijon mustard. We drizzled that over it and it's perfect! We've served this to house guests and everyone raves about it!

Anyone that doesn't at least try this recipe "as is" is crazy! Even those that don't trust the mustard dressing. This salad is incredible. Even my picky 11 year old enjoyed it. I can't wait to make it again. Don't change a thing when you make this! (I used dijon mustard in the dressing, which was lovely) We had this as a salad to accompany steak and potatoes. I'd love to hear other good pairing ideas.

I added dried cranberries for flavor and color and candied walnuts.  I could not do a mustard dressing on this??.  I used a raspberry dressing (Girard's) a definite keeper.  You could use this recipes with apples and dried cherries, or several other choices.  I used some feta cheese on top.  This is a total winner!!

Maybe only needs two pears but it's an outstanding salad.  The avocado adds a really nice creaminess. Very well balanced and the mustard vinaigrette works great with pears!!!

Love this recipe!  I substitute crumbled blue cheese and candied pecans already made from Trader Joe's .  You can always drizzle and stir in dressing so if you are not a fan of an overly "dressed" wet salads then you can cut down the dressing recipe. 

Adults love this recipe!

I made it as is, except I eyeballed the lettuce, cheese, pear, and pecan portions and left out the avocado. Phenomenal! 5/5 stars without a doubt. At first, I wasn't sure of the dressing, but ended up really loving it!

This salad is really good.  The dressing really does pull it all together.  I would suggest not combining the ingredients in one bowl.  The pecans and lettuce get soggy, not good eats for left overs. :)

Rave reviews from the family at Christmas.  Prepared the dressing (doubled) ahead of time and just set out on the counter.  Carmelized the pecans by adding 2 Twater to the sugar (next time I will start with 1T and see how it goes).  Roquefort cheese = blue cheese.  I think any cheese would be good with this.  I used a 10 oz. 50/50 mix of spring greens and spinach.  Layered the pears (used 2 bosc) and apple slices around the outside of the salad.  Great flavor and presentation!!  Thanks so much!  I have already passed this recipe on!

it was so- good. Thanks to other reviews, I doubled the dressing content except for the olive oil and made it the night before. Used Asian pears because that's what I had and shallots instead of green onion. So yummy.

Great salad... Next time I'll use less cheese and the recommended amount of dressing (I had doubled it this time).  For personal  preference, I'll also leave out the onions.

Made for an early family Christmas dinner.  I made another salad in case the kids didn't like the blue cheese, but didn't need to as they loved this too!  The caramelized Pecans really topped it off.  I used my own Balsamic dressing though as I didn't want to risk the mustard for such a big do.  Also used creamy blue which is generally liked by a wider audience.

We made this for an Annual Dinner Meeting for our Chamber of Commerce and it went over really well.  The pecans were a little tricky and we added a mixture of feta and Roquefort so it wasn't too strong.  Went over very well!

SO good. I substituted with gorgonzola... worked very well with the rest of the flavors. The dressing is the best part - tangy! I took this salad to a dinner party and everyone raved about it. Tip - buy the pre-glazed pecans, so much easier.

Wow!  This is spectacular. I am not a fan of blue cheese, so I used Feta instead and it was great.  I suggest making extra pecans...there was quite a lot of nibbling from the counter as I prepared this.

Holy  this was SO GOOD! New favorite special salad for our house. I followed the recipe - I had no idea how easy it was to candy pecans! - with 2 changes: 1). I used goat cheese instead of blue cheese, 2). I didn't use oil in the dressing. The oil I used had a funny after taste, so I made it again and just omitted the oil from the dressing and it was perfect. Thank you for this recipe!

Getting ready to make this for the 3rd Thanksgiving in row! I always try to bring something green and interesting and this salad has become a big fav of my family, especially my young adult nieces. I would say it is not a very healthy salad with the cheese and pecans but it is yummy and adds a unique flavor combo to what can sometimes be a bit boring (my opinion) Thanksgiving day meal.

Incredibly delicious!!!  The flavors are amazing and compliment each other perfectly.  I used Dijon mustard, which I highly recommend.  For the dressing, I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  Also I used less sugar in the dressing.  Lastly, I used gorgonzola cheese, instead of Roquefort cheese.  It was devoured in 2 days and I am craving more.

Holy Cow! I made this for a church luncheon and it could not have been a better choice. I only made one mistake. I cut the pears the night before since it was a large amount for the number of servings needed. They basically turned to mush by the time I needed them. So in a panic, I drained canned pears and cut them into 1 inch pieces.  It was surprisingly fabulous. I will probably use canned ones next time and save myself the trouble. There are so many flavors in this salad, I doubt anyone even noticed. This will be my new "go to" salad for entertaining. It was that good.

We loved it.  We didn't put in the nuts since one of us had a nut issue.  Used Bleu cheese and an oil and vinegar mixture with lemon pepper instead of the recipe dressing.  A keeper, even without the nuts.

5 stars because this won over the hearts of my lady's family this Thanksgiving.
This salad was gone in under 10 minutes.
The beautiful thing is how easily you can substitute and maintain that great taste!
I added a bit of red delicious apples, red onions to sub regular and I used gorgonzola instead.
The apples and onions made it colourful and appealing.
I added a bit of walnuts with the pecans. 
The end result was an amazing fall-themed salad that had people asking for the recipe.
Usually the turkey is the highlight of Thanksgiving, but not this year!

This is really good. I used an Apple instead of Pear and no cheese. It was perfect. The pecans are super tasty! They get sticky fast! I think next time I might put them straight onto a cutting board so once they harden you can cut them more easily. Some of mine stuck to the wax paper. They harden fast. The dressing is delicious. Very good recipe. We will make again!!

Wow, wow, WOW!!!  If I could give this salad 6 stars I would! The dressing is phenomenal (if you like tang and garlic), and the toppings are outstanding.  They match perfectly!  I would not change a thing. The pecans are so yummy, I could have eaten them up before I even put them in the salad!  The dressing is King here, though.  I doubled it because my husband and I like lots of dressing.  The ingredients  seems healthy-so why not!!  : ) Michelle, thank you so much for this awesome recipe! I'll make it again and again!

MY NEW FAVORITE!  Easy to make, beautiful, and DELICIOUS! Perfect to bring to a dinner party. I left out the onion and avocado- think it would have been too much going on in there.  I made the dressing a couple of hours ahead of time so the flavors could settle in, which they did nicely (doubled dressing recipe). I never use dijon mustard, but did for this.  It was a perfect compliment, once the flavors rested and blended. I used garlic from the jar, didn't peel the pears, used a 9 oz container of gorganzola, 11oz box of spring mix (which seems to double in size!), and laid it out onto a large platter,  which was beautiful!  p.s. would be great with plain pecans/walnuts- not carmelized.

I enjoyed this as a large dinner salad. The dressing was really good, but the amount doesn't go a long way. I made it for myself, and there wasn't much left. So if you're making it for more than 1-2 people, you probably may want to double or triple it (as other reviewers mentioned, as well). A big step saver: I used prepackaged sweet and spicy pecans that I had on hand that worked excellent, and I used red onion in place of the green. A delicious and healthy salad. Thanks Michelle K!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. It is a new favorite at my house! I doubled the recipe and used just 4 pears instead of 6....I also added more pecans...well because nuts are delicious!!! Since I doubled the recipe I tripled the dressing to be on the safe side...no reason to I had plenty of left over.

Excellent doubled everything in the dressing ingredients besides the salt, used country dijon mustard. Also doubled the pecans and cooled on parchment paper. We used a cranberry covered goat cheese which was excellent in substitution for blue cheese (which I do not like).

Hapoy T-day,
I think I found a carmelization trick.  I incorporated  about 1 TBSP  soft/ warmish butter to the sugar in the pan so that it resembled a crumble;  I THEN turned the heat on to low.  I think this gave me greater control of the melting temperature as it happens maybe more evenly.
Bon Apetit!

The salad came out pretty good. I used Gorgonzola cheese which grew on me. My husband tried the salad and just did not like it. But then again he doesn't like anything that looks weird. I would make this again and possibly bring it in for a potluck or something and see if it gets the same kinds of reviews as I see here.

This salad has a wonderful blend of salty, crispy, fresh and sweet.  I forgot to add the Avocado but it was delicious.  A very nice side to a rich main, such as lasagna.  The dressing is very nice.

I was hesitant when I read all the amazing reviews but I am a believer now. This salad is really really good . It is simple to make but wow, so good. I got tons of compliments at my dinner party. Usually I have salad leftover, not this time! This is my new go to dinner party salad, quick, easy, basic dressings and  delicious!

Fantastic salad! Refreshing. However I did make extra dressing (double the quantity) and it was perfect. Everyone enjoyed it and surprisingly, the candied pecans turned out great.

Amazingly delicious salad! Tastes like a $14 salad from a fancy steakhouse. My pears weren't ripe so I used apples instead and it worked perfectly. I also used a little less roquefort due to the strong flavor. The pecans and the dressing is what makes this salad really come together.

Just finished making this and it is PERFECT! Exactly what I was looking for :-) I may add a bit of crumbled bacon next time (mostly because it's easier to get my boys to eat it if it has bacon). I will definitely add this to the dinner rotation.

I knew this was going to be delicious when I read the ingredients.  I forgot onion but had shallots on hand and used them instead.  These flavors marry well together and this recipe is committed to memory and will be made many more times.  Thank you.

I've made this two times. Both times it was absolutely scrumptious. The second time I made it I sprinkled dried cherries on top, which was a nice addition both for flavor and appearance. But unnecessary, as this salad is perfect as is in my opinion!

This was one of the best salad's I've ever made or tasted.  Took it to a pot luck at work and it was the first thing gone.  I used hot mustard instead of regular prepared mustard and added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the dressing.

So many great reviews, but this salad was a total and utter bomb for me. I messed up every aspect of it. I mixed the salad ingredients with the only change of using some dried chives instead of green onions. Within 10 minutes I had salad mush. The saltiness from the cheese completely broke down my lettuce. The pears were on the very soft side and that just helped to do that I think. I would highly recommend making all of the components and assembling them on the individual plates. Then, I followed the instructions for the pecans and the sugar did not stick. I had giant clumps of hardened sugar with lightly coated pecans. I have so many oven baked glazed nut recipes that are wonderful. I had never tried this method before. Needless to say after the salad turned to mush and the pecans did not turn out, I didn't bother with the dressing as I had nothing to put it on. I consider myself a pretty advanced cook. Maybe, just too many components here? it's definitely more of a fancy salad and not what I would consider a large one bowl family salad as the directions suggest. I will be greatful if any of this gets eaten at this point.

Best salad EVER.  Used gorgonzola instead of Roquefort.  Didn't include the green onions.  Used more pecans than called for and a little less sugar.  Used only 2 pears instead of 3 (mine were pretty large).  The combination of flavors together is out of this world!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful! I did leave out the avocado and exchanged the green onion for red onion and added some dried cranberries. The flavors and textures together were perfect! This is definitely a recipe you can prepare as written, or change up to your liking and you can't go wrong. The dressing as prepared was a delicious compliment.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Great recipe. I did not put the pecans in after I prepped them because I felt that they were on the edge of being bad. The salad was great without them but think it would be even better with the pecans.

We made this recipe for the first time for a potluck dinner and our kids helped - it was that simple!
The salad was delicious and people really appreciated the homemade carmelized pecans and homemade dressing.

This salad is amazing! My four children (NOT salad eaters) actually loved their green dinner. Major win, but... the dressing was not a success. I just got out a bottle of Italian and a bottle of Ranch and the kiddos just had their pic. Also, was unable to find Roquefort cheese at my local market so I did a blind swap for Gruyere cheese. Awesome dinner.

Is there supposed to be some kind of liquid in the sugar in order to caramelize the pecans? Seems that sugar alone would burn. These online recipes really test my cooking skills. Seems there is always either a missing ingredient, or one left over. The site is demanding that I rate it with stars, but I haven't tried it, yet. Guess I'll go in the middle based on the fact that it sounds good.

The only thing I did different was substitute gorgonzola, doubled the dressing and added dried cranberries for flavor and color. The Bosc pears that another rater suggested were great in this salad. It's been a huge hit time and again at family gatherings! You can't go wrong with this salad!

This is such an outstanding salad that, when asked what she wanted me to make for a potluck in honor of her last day, a colleague requested this salad.  She remembered it from a party I made it for OVER A YEAR AGO.  I made it exactly as directed, and it was devoured!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  You cannot go wrong with this for any occasion.  Thanks for the great recipe!

One of the best salad recipes ever! My husband had 3 helpings and couldn't stop raving about it! It was the perfect combination and definitely romaine is the best type of lettuce for this dish. Certainly I will make this salad when we have company.

Made this recipe for a Sunday party. It had everything I love in a salad. Women liked it; men didn't care for it. I used red leaf lettuce and I think it would be better with a crunchier lettuce, like romaine or iceberg. The soft red leaf was pretty but the salad was hard to eat with party forks because you couldn't get a taste of everything on the fork. You ended up with bite of lettuce then a bite of pear and then a bite of avocado. I had to leave the nuts on the side because of a friend's food allergy and the men ate the nuts out of the dish and left the salad. Tasted good just wasn't a ballpark hit.

This has become my favorite salad!  The combination of fruit, pecans, & blue cheese with this dressing is outstanding.  I sometimes use different fruit and twick the dressing a bit; but always come back to this.

I thought this was very good - I made it as written, but used gorgonzola as I was unable to find roquefort in my town. My only criticism is I don't think the avocado adds anything to this dish except (good) fat and calories. Given the cheese and the oil in the dressing, I will leave out the avocado next time and use it in a nice guac instead :)

I loved this salad. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a little butter to the pecans and they turned out great. My pears weren't quite ripe enough but the salad was still great. I also doubled the dressing at the advice of other reviewers and am glad I did.

It turned out too sweet for me. Since my pears were ripe, they were already sweet, so I could have used simply roasted pecans and no sugar in the dressing. I didn't notice the mustard at all. Since I made this for a lunch salad, I should have omitted the garlic, but I didn't this time. Overall, I'll give it a second change with some small changes.

This is a great recipe and the dressing is fantastic.  The pecans confused me so I might not include those next time and I FORGOT the cheese.

Loved this! Will definitely make again. Per tips from previus reviews, I used Gorgonzolo cheese for milder taste, and also made dressing night before and doubled it. This recipe is definitely a "keeper" and a great one to keep on hand to impress company. Thanks!

Used Roquefort sheep blue cheese. Found it a bit strong for me, but my husband loved it! I did eat 3 servings so guess it wasn't all that bad. Especially enjoyed the pears. Thank you for this.

I made this salad last night for my sisters birthday.  It was delicious.  I barbecued steak and roast potatoes.  It was the right mix of beef, bland and savoury. I will add this to my recipe box.  It was delicious and my company loved it, a keeper.

I was looking for a salad for Christmas day lunch.  I was initially thinking of something with cherry tomatoes, but after some research, I found that pears are a traditional Christmas food around much of the world and pecans are always a favorite here in Georgia.  I am so glad I stumbled across this recipe.  It was a HUGE success and despite making enough for 18, the entire salad was devoured within 24 hours.  I'm not sure if I would include the avocados the next time I make this, but there will definitely be a next time.  CHEERS!

I made this on Christmas Eve.  I bought the fancy Roquefort and was a little worried because it was blue and oily, but it ended up being delicious.  I used Grey Poupon for the mustard and I substituted truffle oil for half of the olive oil.  It. Was. Amazing.  This will be a go to recipe for me.  So good.

I first tried this salad on Thanksgiving of 2010.  I didn't change anything intentionally.  However, for the dressing, I didn't have regular yellow mustard, which is too pungent for my taste anyway, so I used Grey Poupon Mild and Creamy Dijon, made with White Wine. It was very good and I received compliments on the whole salad. I was just recently trying to think of a good salad to make and when I remembered this one, had to run  to the grocery store to get the ingredients I didn't have.  This time, I used half yellow mustard and half of the Grey Poupon and it wasn't bad. I love the avocado-pear combination.  I use iceberg lettuce, or spring mix, whatever is on hand.  All in all, this salad is one of my favorites and the combinations are superb.  I highly recommend it!

I am a huge salad lover, and this salad is amazing. I make it often when I have guests over. It's a winner every time. I have substituted the blue cheese for feta when I am out of blue. Delicious! I also just make the dressing to put over other salads. Love the dressing!

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!  Our family of 6 was so busy inhaling this salad that there was no conversation at the table until the salad bowl was empty!  Recipe is PERFECT as written... I did substitute a bag of Spring mix just because it's easier, and I double the candied pecans now because my family fights over them (and they usually try to sneak some before I can finish making the salad).  I always use this salad when I want to impress a dinner guest :)  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe, Michelle

People either loved it or didn't.  I thought it was ok.  I'm not a big fan of blue cheese.  People who like blue cheese loved it.  I made it the way the recipe called for except I used gorgonzola.  Younger kids wouldn't eat it.  I liked the dressing.  It'd be good with chicken.

Terrific recipe, it was a big hit for Christmas dinner. The flavors went so well together. I made extra pecans and used them on a french toast bake. I only made 2 changes: I used Feta cheese instead of blue, but I think the blue would have been great, too. After reading other reviews, I used a milder mustard, Gulden's Spicy Brown, and only 1 tsp. I originally wanted to use a Dijon, but it would have been too strong of a flavor. The dressing was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

Was excellent.  Pair it with a Broccoli Cheese soup or a New England Clam Chowder and Homemade bread.  Perfect.

I had to leave out the avocado, which is what makes this different, because our avocado was tasteless. Try again when I have a haas avocado. Without the avocado, the dressing was bland and I would have used my regular balsamic viniagrette.

Absolutely amazing!  My new favorite salad.  I left the mustard out once and it was still good.  Slice those pears thin with a carrot pealer....great texture for those who don't like grainy pears.  Not overpowering at all.  Gotta stick with the homemade carmalized pecans.  Store bought just aren't good enough.

OMG! This was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!! My husband and I had three longtime guy friends over last night (and I've never personally witnessed some of them eat a single vegetable in all the years I've known them) and EVERYONE, including my salad-hating husband, had TWO heaping plates of this! My husband is already requesting to have it again, soon! THANK YOU!

I made this salad for my husbands family and it was gone! Everyone loved it! I added celery to it. I also used Feta cheese instead of Blue cheese. Lots of compliments! Will defiantly make this again.

Fabulous salad! This is my #1 go-to salad for holidays and other special events. I grow lettuce in the cool months - it's wonderful with variety of baby lettuces. If pears aren't available, apples are a good substitute - can also substitute walnuts for the pecans. Love the dressing!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!  It is my favorite salad.  I have made it repeatedly and never get tired of it.  Like anything else, you can tweak.  I am about to serve it but didn't have any avocado (which I love).   Too lazy to mince garlic so put garlic powder in the dressing.  So what?  It's a keeper (rare).

Everything the other reviews said about all of the flavors complementing each other was entirely true!  This was a delicious salad.  I had never made candied pecans before, but it was easy to do as stated in the instructions.  We have continued to use the dressing on other salads and also enjoy it with those.  I will make this often in the future.

Amazing!!  I used baby spinach because that was all I had, also subsituted apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar, added craisins and sliced almonds and was amazed at the flavor.  Light, refreshing, and robust at the same time.  Delish!!  will definitely make again!!

I thought this salad was terrific!  Made it for my "alternative" Thanksgiving, since I didn't have time to cook a more traditional menu.  I used red bartlett pears, red onion, and a really good bleu cheese.  Omitted the avocado, since I knew I would be storing leftovers.  I don't usually eat salad dressing, but I made this one - and then forgot to use it!  Salad was terrific without dressing.  Also, to cut calories, next time I make this salad, I'm going to toast the pecans instead of carmelizing them - although they were fantastic!

This salad was good, but *really* intense. Very strong flavor and a "heavy" salad. I served this as a side with Christmas dinner and it overwhelmed everything else. It would've been perfect if it had been taken down a notch. If I make this again, I'll probably use less pear, green onion, avocado, and dressing.

Great salad.  Made this to take to a friend's house and I'm not a big salad person and she doesn't really like pears.  We both LOVED this salad.  The complementary tanginess of the dressing with the sweetness of the pecans and pears was wonderful.  I did substitute the roquefort with feta cheese and skipped the avocado, but otherwise stuck to the exact recipe.  I would definitely recommend trying this.

I substituted fresh mixed greens and feta instead of Roquefort. Also red onions instead of green and walnuts instead of pecans. Doesn't matter.  What I did a bit different, is carmelize the nuts, like you said, but in about 1 tbsp molasses and 1 tsp butter. Then let it cool while I threw all the greens together.   After that, I simmered 4-6 tbsp balsamic vinegar and the olive oil and mustard in the same pan to soak up the molasses. Then let that cool while I cleaned up. Then I served it on a big platter.   The dressing was a bit warm when I poured it on. Delicious!!!  Otherwise, it was more or less the same as yours. I haven't used pears in a salad before! No white sugar, though. Thx for this recipe!

It's ok, but almost too much going on.  Sadly, the avocados got lost amidst the cheese and dressing, and the dressing was just ok.  Nice idea, but I think it could use a little editing.  The pear/cheese combination is lovely, though.

This is really a great salad!! I didn't use the Roquefort cheese as we aren't big fans of blue cheese. I used Feta instead which worked really well!! I doubled the amount of dressing too just to make sure there was enough, I had some left over (dressing)!! It was just so delicious with the crunchy nuts, creamy avacado and sweet pears!! Yummy!! Thanks for this awesome recipe!! Definitely a keeper!!

This salad is delicious!  I love the combination of ingredients.  Sometimes I eat this salad as a meal in itself.  It also tastes good with chopped cooked chicken breast.

I made this salad with our Easter dinner.  Everyone loved it!  I especially liked it because I was able to do most of the prep work the night before.  All I had to do before dinner was cut the pears and avocados and put everything in a bowl.

A new favourite. Glad I read the review that said to make extra candied pecans to have on hand. It comes in handy when you want to just whip this salad up.  My guy and I had a similar salad in a restaurant in New York, and he said this one was better. Very tasty!

My best review would be from my son who avoids anything green and he loves everything in this salad.  I have substituted feta cheese for blue cheese and apples for pears and it still tastes great.  Such a simple dressing also!

Everyone loved this salad! I subed blue cheese for Roquefort, omitted the sugar in the dressing and used dijon mustard. Next time I will try and use honey instead of sugar to coat the nuts. Didn't have pecans and used almonds... TASTY!! The salad is so good on every level.

Yummy!  I made this to go with our Christmas dinner and it was a hit.  I even left out the avocado and green onions.  The nuts mixed with the pear and cheese (I used gorgonzola) was a great combination.  This is a great recipe for any time, but it also presents really well for company and special occasions.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS!  Like another reviewer, I used romaine instead of leaf lettuce for a sturdier lettuce.  I used less sugar when I caramelized the pecans.  I thought the amount of dressing was perfect despite some reviewers saying it wasn't enough.  The flavors mesh together for a taste sensation!

Made this for Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it.  I didnt add the avocado because I didnt want it to brown in the salad.  I also added dried cranberries.  For me, however, I thought that the dressing was too sweet.  I did add some diced shallots to it and that helped a little bit.

I enjoyed the flavors of this salad very much.  I cheated a bit though and used store-bought pecans that were already sugared but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I enjoyed the way the dressing complimented the flavors.

This was a good salad - I make a salad similar to this but I use balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. I liked this dressing though.  I used plain walnuts for time saving, but I would like to try the salad with the glazed walnuts another time.  I will probably make again.

Yummy!  Everyone loved this salad, hands down!  I only made 2 substitutions: feta for the blue cheese and romaine for the lettuce.  The candied pecans make this salad worthy of about 10 stars all by themselves.

I made this for some customers from the UK who came to my home for thanksgiving.  Everyone really loved it.  I skipped the avocado and used a local gorgonzola cheese because the Roquefort was much more expensive.  I used Barlett pears and added dried cranberries to add color.  I agree with the another reviewer who said to put the dressing  on last or leave it on the side.  The lettuce will wilt.  My father, who normally only eats processed cheese squares, loved the salad.  I am adding this one to the recipe box.

Wow!  What  a wonderful recipe.  I made this salad to take to a friends house for a neighborhood get-together and received all positive responses and praises.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  It was so easy and absolutely refreshing.  Will be making this for many occasions from now on.  I omitted the onions, added more lettuce and doubled the dressing.  Can I say Wow again?  Wow.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Fantastic salad!  Got rave reviews at dinner party last night.  :)  To serve 8, I used 2 packages of spring greens, 3 bosc pears (unpeeled and chopped), no avocado, 1/3 of a red onion (thinly sliced), and 5 ounces crumbled Gorgonzola cheese (on the side).  Doubled the dressing and the candied nuts (walnuts, not pecans).  The salad bowl was emptied -- it was that popular!  Ate it again today for lunch, with addition of 1 diced avocado.  This version tastes great as well.  Will be making it many more times...  Btw, I am definitely not a blue cheese or Gorgonzola fan, but even I enjoyed the cheese when mixed with the rest of the flavourful salad.

This is awesome!  I can't wait to make it again.  Didn't have guac or garlic on hand so I skipped those.  Used red onions instead of green b/c that's what I had on hand.  It was delicious.  Can't wait to go out & get all the ingredients to follow recipe exactly.  There will definitely be many, many next times.

I cannot begin to tell you how much my guests and I enjoyed this salad - the only change I  had to make was the cheese - some of my guests were a bit worried about the strength of the Roquefort, so I substituted it with a good feta for the less adventurous.  Personally, I tried both cheeses on separate occasions and loved both.  Do NOT hesitate to make this salad!  j

OMG. This is the best salad ever. **For those who like things spicy HOT try hitting the pecans with a shake of cayenne pepper while they are still warm.

Excellent recipe. I ran out of time and so didn't carmelize the pecans, but it was still very good. I made sure to buy high quality blue cheese, that makes a load of difference. Look forward to making this recipe with the pecans carmelized. Thanks.

Bought candied pecans instead of making my own as a short cut.  Otherwise this was a great mix of flavors.  I served it with pumpkin alfredo pasta for a delightful fall dish.

My sister brought this recipe for christmas and I've been making it ever since.  My friends ask me to bring it to every function.  I keep the cheese to the side and offer feta and blue for those people who are a little picky with their cheeses.

I make variations on this all the time: apple for pear, bleu or goat cheese for Roquefort, walnuts for pecans, etc. Tangy fruit, sweet crunchy nuts and tart cheese are a winning combination. The dressing is awesome.

I've made this several times and have gotten rave reviews each time. It's even becoming legendary. Sometimes I omit the avocado and drop a pinch of thyme into the dressing. It's delicious both ways.

This has become a family favourite!!  The dressing is wonderful with a nice garlicy tang to it.  Works fine with any blue cheese, I use stilton most often.  Also, I don't use avocado all the time and still tastes great.

Great salad! I already made it twice! The second time I used Blue Danish cheese instead of Roquefort, as it is a little milder, and walnuts instead of pecans. It goes very well with the recipe "Curried pear soup"(the video) on this website, and with French baguette. Yummy!!

One of my favorite salads. I do sub the pear with beets though. Even if beets aren't your thing. I promise you'll love it like this. Beets & goat cheese are like pb&j. They compilment each other very well. Trust me. I personally am not a huge fan of beets, but I'll always eat them like this. Also, this goes very well with pork and duck, and if you want to serve it with a wine it goes marvelously with a sweet Washington Riesling or an Auslese Riesling. This salad is alway a hit, I've served it at a wine club I was hosting and for Thanksgiving, no complaints. People came back for 2nds

We made this salad for a party and everyone loved it, even people who do not like mustard.  I made a few alterations:  red wine vinaigrette instead of oil and vinegar, apples instead of pears, dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard, and I tripled the avocados.

What a salad! The flavors are fabulous! And it's easy to make; however I had trouble with the pecans following the directions given. Second time around, I placed sugar in a skillet and let it liquify before tossing in the nuts. Perfect! Also, the waxed paper didn't work for me; I simply placed nuts on a plate (separating immediately) and let cool. Will make again and again.

I make this salad all the time now! Very easy and very good; just make sure you use fresh, perfectly ripe pears. I also switch up which blue cheese I use (Danish blue, gorgonzola, etc) depending on what I have on hand.

Delicious!!  Used gorgonzola cheese instead and would recommend bosc (we used the green ones which weren't as sweet)

Words cannot describe how absolutely fabulous this salad tastes. Heavenly? Divine? Not earthy enough for the wonderful mix of organic, earth-bound flavors. Everyone who tries it says this is by far the best salad they have ever eaten.

THis recipe is great, give yourself at least 30 minutes to make the candied pecans, the sugar takes a while to heat up and candy... and watch out for chunks of sugar because they'll hurt your teeth! I use less sugar in the dressing depending on how ripe the pears are. Otherwise, this is a great salad that even my very picky boyfriend will eat.

I made this last night and it was great. I don't like blue cheese so I used feta and loved it. It's quick to make but so much better than another plain old salad.

Excellent!  I doubled the dressing and poured almost all of it on.  I also skipped the avocado since I didn't have any, but I'll definitely try to include that next time.  I used green onions, though next time I'll use red for color.  I will definitely make again.

Fabulous! Will definitely make again! I had to omit the nuts so I was sure to keep the avocado so that there'd be some staying power since this salad was our entire dinner.

Made the following changes: used 2/3 of a box of mixed greens instead of leaf lettuce, used 3 different pears (great mix of textures and sweetness/tartness), used saga (a Danish blue) instead of Roquefort, used red onion instead of green onions, omitted nuts because of a nut allergy.

I made it exactly as directed but found there was too much cheese! Roquefort is pretty strong and a little overwhelming in the salad. Half as much will probably make it perfect. Apart from that, this salad was a winner.

This is one of my favorite salads, and I make it about twice a month.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I use thinly sliced red onion instead of green.  I'm not a huge fan of strongly flavored blue cheese, so I prefer to use reduced-fat crumbled blue cheese, which I have found to be milder than the cheese in block form.  It's wonderful either way though!

I made this salad for a "girls retreat" weekend and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. The dressing was a little tangy and that blended well with the caramelized pecans. I plan to make it again for a christmas luncheon.

I saw the reviews/ratings on this recipe and had to try it for a girls’ only dinner!  My first thought was this salad better be spectacular with so many 5 star ratings...and it was!  Everyone loved it, even people that didn't like blue cheese.  I followed the recipe exact, except I had to sub Gorgonzola cheese for the Roquefort, my grocery store didn't have any Roquefort.

Wonderful crowd pleaser!  I looked up at the buffet spread and poof! it was ALL GONE.

Quick tips inspired by the cooking style on that Semi-Homemade Cooking show:  1.) I used store-bought red-wine vinaigrette.  2.)I used store-bought candied pecans that cinnamon & sugar on them.  3.)I used blue-cheese because that's what the grocery store had.  4.)I used the "spring mix" salad in a bag.

Those two shortcuts worked fantastically in this salad.

Yummy yummy. This is one of the best salads I ever had. Anybody who was fortunate enough to be aournd to sample it utterly loved it. Used almonds instead of pecans and it still turned out great.

I wasn't sure about the dressing after tasting it on its own, but it works well with the other ingredients - especially the cheese.  I really want more of this salad, except it's not exactly low in fat and calories.  Will make again.

This salsd may be the way to a man's heart! I personally removed the avocados since I am not a fan, but the dressing combined with the nuts, pears and a mix of lettuce and arugula was wonderful. I will definitely make this again!

This salad rocks! I used a spring mix instead of leaf lettuce and omitted the avocado b/c I didn't have any.  We loved it and will definitely make it again.

I give this 10 stars!  This is one of the best salads I have ever eaten.  I was told I could make this anytime I wanted to and I certainly will.  I didn't change a thing and it was perfect.  Thank you, Thank you!

This is the best salad recipe ever! I used red onion because I did not have any spring onions, however it still tasted great! I wouldn't change a thing. Great salad for the holidays!

Very very good.  I loved the pecans and pear combo.  Wasn't as impressed with the dressing.  Didn't stop me from eating a huge bowl though!

This salad was amazing!  I made it with apples once since pears weren't available and it was fine.  My family, who usually aren't salad people, ate every bit of it.  It was actually way better than the main course I served!!  And its so easy to make too.  Wait until the last minute for the dressing or it will wilt, at least that's what happened the first time to me.

I added prisciutto to this salad and it was amazing! I highly recommend doing so.  A quarter of a pound, thinly sliced made three salads. I kept the ingredients in the dressing the same but change the proportions.....more vinegar and less oil to taste. I probably had 1/2 cup of vinegar with 1/3 cup oil by the end of it and 3 t of dijon mustard.  I kept wondering if craisins would be good in it and might try that next time!

This was so good that I've made it multiple times, one change was that I used bagged lettuce as it is dry, when I used fresh lettuce I didn't dry it enough and the salad was soggy.

This is a favorite potluck recipe. If I am not serving it right away, I leave out the avocado so that it doesn't go brown and I add the dressing right before serving. I always make extra nuts because they are yummy and can go with other dishes/snacks. For every potluck at work, the staff basically tells me that I am bringing this salad.

This is delicious, a definite winning flavor combination! The recipe is a bit big, so I don't add the dressing to the whole thing...that way I can have leftovers that aren't soggy the next day for lunch. I am reminded how much I love pears and cheese! I will be making this again soon.

It is no surprise to me that this receipe is as highly rated and reviewed as it is.   I found it while searching for something similar to a salad I had at a wedding and I'm glad I gave it a shot.  This salad changed my life. Every flavor in it was perfect... the avacado and cheese added a delicious thick creamy flavor, the dressing was bold and contrasting and the pears and pecans were sweet and crunchy. It was perfect from start to finished and I was disappointed to see that my family finished it off without much room for seconds.  I used Gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, and if I were going to make it again I would double the amount of candied pecans.. but beyond that, Absolute perfection.

This was REALLY good. Loved the mixture of flavors. Made as written, except I used walnuts instead of pecans because thats what I had, and threw in some cold chicken breasts. Loved the dressing.

This recipe is awesome. Definitely the best salad I've ever had. Made it for my family last week and everyone loved it. The way that the flavors combined so nicely really surprised me.  The only modification I made was to double the dressing.Can't wait to make this one again!!

Tips:  Add 1-2 TB water to the pecans/sugar when caramelizing to prevent burning.  Also, definitely double the dressing.  Leave off green onions and avocado - unnecessary.  Blue cheese optional.  So Good!!!

At first, I thought this salad was just okay. I made it again tonight with spinach rather than lettuce and it was AWESOME!!! I decreased the Roquefort Cheese and doubled the pecans and avocado. ***UPDATE*** I saw a similar recipe off a magazine like this one. The MAIN difference was sauteeing the pears in 2 tsp canola oil for 5 minutes and then adding some brown sugar. Although I made the pears this way and immediately ate it, I prefer this recipe without the sauteed pears. Maybe if I would have let the pears cooled it would have been better. Maybe. Maybe not. I'm not sure but the pears did lose a lot of the ripe juicy taste. Next time, no sauteed pears!!!

This is excellent.  The only thing I changed was that I used a different recipe off of this site for the pecans so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. I tried them the way this recipe wanted them made and they turned out horrible.  Baking them at a low temp for an hour is better. Edited: changed to 5 stars bc I've tried the pecans this way a couple more times and they've turned out better but I still prefer the other method if I have the time.

Wow, this is an amazing salad!  I followed the recipe pretty closely only making these few modifications: I used a spring mix for the lettuce, I chose a Dijon style of mustard, I added more avocado, and I put one extra tablespoon of vinegar in the dressing.  This is surely a recipe I’ll be using for years to come. Thank you, Michelle.

This was great, I liked it a lot, but hubby went head over heels for it.  I thought it needed a little zing and color.  For that I use red onions instead of green.  I'm also thinking a little cayenne in with the sugar for the pecans could also give it a little kick.  Oh and speaking of pecans, I followed the recipe exactly - no water needed. If no time for sugared pecans, plain toasted pecans will do.  I always use feta cheese.

Wow!  This was the best salad I have had in a long time.  Even my hubby agreed.   I used low fat bleu cheese, a combo of romaine and spinach, and skipped the nuts because I do not care for any type of nut.  Will make again and again, as it is a refreshing and impressive dish.

Very good, I like the sharpness of the blue cheese and the crunch from the pecans.

Expected a fantastic salad given the reviews but was not at all impressed.  "Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad" is MUCH better.

This was delicious. I used romaine lettuce, and dijon mustard in the dressing.  It does make a lot of dressing, so adjust to amount of lettuce.  Will be making this again.

Threw dressing ingredients into food processor to avoid chopping garlic, eyeballed measurements, came out delicious.  So much better than anything you can buy in a bottle and so simple to make. thanks for posting this recipe.

I would give this recipe 100 stars if possible, it is that divine.  I was convinced I did not like blue cheese until I had this salad, and lets just say I have been converted.  All the flavors and textures go so well together, from the sweet crunchy pecans to the smooth buttery avocado it is heaven in your mouth, trust me!  I just wish it was lower in fat (sigh).

This was an excellent salad.  The only changes I made was to use feta instead of blue cheese and I used a bag of Spring Mix salad instead of a head of lettuce.  I will definitely be making this again, but I will not use all the salad dressing next time.  It was too much for my personal preference.

I would lessen the cheese next time - it was too strong for me.  Otherwise, this is an excellent dish - especially to take to potlucks.

Yum!  This salad is awesome and the presentation was beautiful.  The only thing I did differently was to add feta instead of the Roquefort because I don't like blue cheese.

Yum!  I left out the avocado and used gorgonzola instead of roquefort.  Dressing was really tasty - although I did use dijon instead of the prepared mustard.  Definitely a keeper!

I was wondering how a salad could get such high ratings (just a salad, after all), but this was delicious.  The walnuts make it.  I used gorgonzola cheese and left out the avocado - everyone loved it.

This salad is amaaaaaaaaaaaaazing!!! Such a wonderful combination of flavours, everthing compliments each other perfectly.. I used spinach leaves, added cranberries, left out the avocado and onion and used almonds instead of pecans.. I doulbed the dressing but it was too oily so next time I'll just double all the ingredients except the oil. This is really great, I know I'll be making it forever!! Thank you so much : )

This has become my special salad.  Everyone asks me to make this for every function - perfect for guests that are vegetarians too.  Emerald makes glazed pecans so I just use those instead glazing my own.

Really unbelievable.  You could serve this at a very nice dinner party.  I used Asian pears (Not pear season) and I think it was even better!  I also used Sweet Spicy Pecans from Trader Joes and it was incredible.

The work party loved this.  Doubling the dressing made too much, but the leftover dressing was perfect for other salads later.

this was really delicious and light. I used mixed spring greens rather than lettuce, and lightly poached half the pears in a vanilla infused simple syrup. Really nice compliment to a light meal.

I was looking for a use for the abundance of Asian pears on my trees in my backyard. I thought this recipe sounded interesting, and tried it out. It is excellent. I used dijon mustard in the dressing (as recommended by another review) and regular bleu cheese. I brought it to a potluck and it was a hit. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this 10/18/2007.  Wow, what a wonderful combination of flavors!  I considered substituting the blue cheese with feta because I had some at home and not sugaring the pecans but ended up following the recipe exactly and I'm so glad I did!  The pecans were so easy to do and really tasted good.  The dressing was absolutely amazing.  I would love to make this once a week.  So quick to throw together and everyone loved it, even my kids!

Awesome.  I used apples in stead of pears and also substituted feta for the Roquefort.  Added a couple of Crasins too.  Fantastic!

This was as delicious as it sounds...wonderful combination of flavors. I doubled the dressing ingredients (except the oil) as many reviwers suggested. I served it at a dinner party and everyone raved about it. I will most definitely make it again.

oh this is fantastic! I have made this before and loved it then too. 

This time, in the dressing I substituted the sugar  with 2 tbsp maple syrup and 1 tbsp honey  (I like a sweeter dressing -can you really have too much ?:)  oh and a large clove of garlic.. and added 2 tsp of dijon mustard yummy...
thanks for this recipe! Will sure use it again.

Amazing,  my boyfriend doesn't typically like salad, but he often request that I make this again.  I actually double the recipe for the dressing as he LOVES the dressing, I'd say it makes the salad.

AWESOME salad.  Added about 2 tsp. of water to the sugar while carmelizing the pecans that helped immensely.  Also used both regular mustard and dijon in the dressing - a nice touch.  Added some craisins (had someone over that can't eat nuts) and it was a nice addition.  Spend the extra money on good blue cheese and you won't be sorry

Mmmmm!  Such lovely flavors in the best combination.  I used crumbly blue cheese, and 1 bosc pear, 1 roma apple.  The dressing is great - don't mess with it too much except for the mustard if you must.  (Use your favorite, I used a white wine dijon and it was amazing.)   To save some for later just keep the ingredients separate and make small batches unless you're cooking for several people. This way you can have some more for a midnight snack.  (You will be craving it again!)

LOVE the salad.  I would've given it 5 stars but the lettuce got soggy when I tossed it. Anyone else experience this problem? Maybe next time I'll  just put the dressing on the side.

Including avocado added a nice twist to the ubiquitous cheese, fruit and caramelized nut combination.  I think just about any flavored vinegar would make this terrific salad a hit!

This was a wow salad. Made it last night for guests. Everyone raved. I couldn't find Roquefort at my grocery store, though, so I used regular blue cheese. I can't wait to make this again!

Mmmmm good.  I would absolutely serve this salad for company.  It just takes a little extra time to carmelize the pecans, but so worth it.  This salad has creamy & crunchy-right up my alley!

This salad is one my favorites and has been a hit with everyone I've made it for.  I didn't change anything... although, I prefer it with Bosc pears.

This was a great hit at last night's bridal shower.  Will admit to a few minor changes, including the use of Stone ground mustard in the dressing and subbing feta for the Roquefort.  Nonetheless, the salad deserves a five-star rating for presentation, flavor and versatility!

I made this for my parents and they loved it! My mom went home the next day and made it as well. I didnt have any red wine vinegar so I used white wine vinegar. My mom used red and she said the white was much better. I will be making this often for future guests! Thank you!

This salad is excellent.  I always get asked for the recipe.  I use crumbled gorgonzola, instead of the bleu.  Sometimes, I even throw in some cubed apples instead or in addition to the pears.  This tastes like a salad at einsteins bagels (thats where I got the gorgonzola idea!)

absolutely the best salad I've ever had.  I make it even better by using a mesclun and herb salad mix I get at the local produce store.  Everyone I serve this to thinks it's fantastic.  Careful doing the pecans - easy to burn.

A wonderful salad! I don't care for avocados so I omited them but I followed the directions exactly and it turned out wonderful. But I think next time I will make a few more candied pecans as I like the sweetness and crunch it gave.

This salad is amazing.  Its better than any fancy salad I've ever eaten in a resturant.  It was a hit with my whole family.  The only thing I would do differently is make extra candied pecans to put in it.
