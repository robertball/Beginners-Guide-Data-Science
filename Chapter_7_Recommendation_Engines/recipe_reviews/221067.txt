...this was just like my Italian grandmother's recipe...now we change it a bit with 8 oz ricotta and 8 oz of mascarpone...and then put about 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips in the pie too.  We are from Bari, Italy; there for the differing cheeses.

I made this as written  no changes.  It was a hit at my house!  The next time I make it I will just cut out a shape in the remaining dough and set it in the center.  Without a picture I didn't know where to put the 3 circles of dough and as you can see from the pic I posted,they look kind of silly!

I liked the pie yet I thought that the crust was too thick so the next time I made it I made half the crust and liked it better. I also added some mini chocolate chips.

This was delicious. I made according to the recipe, but added 1/4 C flour to the filling because my ricotta was very soft.
I rolled out my crust and made a lattice top, so the bottom crust was not too thick. If you cannot manage a lattice top crust, I would suggest at least rolling (not patting) the bottom crust. My family raved about this pie.
