What a DELICIOUS recipe!!  Between 2 of us we ate 3/4 of it- lol!!  I used egg beaters in place of all but 1 egg- and reduced fat 'mexican blend' cheese and a bit of parmesan cheese that was left in the fridge- I had no brocoli- I sauteed an onion, a red pepper and some mushrooms with garlic, and used Canadian bacon and fresh tomatoes.  This is a great 'use up everything in the fridge' sort of recipe!  The egg mixture that binds it together was DELICIOUS!  This will be a standard recipe for us now- easy and DELICIOUS!!

This is indeed colorful, that's for sure! It really makes a statement on the plate compared to, say, the same old scrambled eggs, and would be a great choice when you want something a little more special or festive. Hubs didn't like the broccoli too much - I did, but it's certainly easy enough to leave out.  I used chopped red bell pepper and chopped onion, saving the chopped green onion for garnish when serving.  Didn't have mushrooms but found this would be good with or without them. I admit I was a wuss and couldn't bring myself to use the full amount of Dijon mustard, but as it turned out I couldn't even tell it was in there and that was fine for us. So, if you want a bold Dijon flavor, go with the full amount.  Similarly with the Italian seasoning, the flavor was subtle.  But it all combined to make something pretty, definitely colorful, delicious and satisfying.

I took this to the luncheon that my ladies' prayer group was having today & I was not only complimented by everyone on it, but was asked for the recipe, too.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I omitted them.  I used a bag of frozen onion/pepper blend (onions, green & red peppers chopped) and sauteed them & it worked out beautifully.  I'm making it again tonight for my family for dinner & think they'll love it, too.

A very nice breakfast casserole! I didn't have ham, so I used cubed turkey kielbasa. I also only had 7 eggs, not 8, but didn't miss the extra egg. My only complaint is that I didn't enjoy the italian seasoning with this casserole. Next time I will use just basil and fresh parsely. Great way to get in some veg for breakfast!

I've just started the paleo diet and this recipe worked great! (without cheese, i love frittatas and i didn't miss the cheese at all!). I added steamed 1" asparagus chunks, sauteed spinach, a green bell pepper, bacon instead of ham, and didn't add the tomatoes. I used olive oil instead of the butter, and i mixed in 1 tablespoon of fage greek yogurt (0% fat) to thicken up the eggs some...  the dijon mustard is such a great idea! this turned out great!

Very Good! Halfway through prep I realized I didn't have any ham (I swear I bought some at the store this weekend) so I just added more broccoli and some leftover corn and it still came out delicious! I baked mine in a greased pie plate and it did take about 15 minutes longer to cook.

This was very good, and a quick weeknight dinner with fruit and cheese toast. I substituted diced zucchini, which I cooked along with the other vegetables, for the ham so it would be vegetarian. It took about 10 minutes longer to cook than the directions said, and was not good as leftovers, but other than that, a great recipe. thanks!

I made this frittata but I changed it up a bit... I didnt use the ham or the broccoli and added a pound of ground beef and browned it with the onions and garlic powder and then added the meat to the egg mixture. The frittata was really good and my family enjoyed it alot!! Thanks for the recipe :)

I love this recipe.  However, I changed it up a bit too, I switched the broccoli with spinach and used  sharp cheddar chesses and it turned out very well.

This recipe was good but not great.  I really like Dijon mustard but this seemed to have a very strong Dijon flavor to it.  Also, for two people this quantity lasted for a few days in our house.  It was better the morning it was made rather than after the fact.  Not sure if it's because it was fresh and hot on the first day or because it was reheated in the microwave, but it didn't seem to taste as good as the first day.  We'll probably make this again but we'll reduce the amount of Dijon mustard and scale the recipe back for two people.  Thanks for sharing.

Lots of flavor with the addition of Dijon mustard and lots of ability to adapt the recipe based on ingredients on hand.  For example, I used chopped fresh spinach rather than broccoli and I didn't add tomatoes to reduce possible runniness in the final product, but served them alongside.  Also, I had to cook the dish longer than original recipe stated.  Will make this dish again and again!

I was skeptical about using broccoli, but it worked very well! I expected leftovers but got very little. I added extra salt as another reviewer suggested but that was a mistake, with the ham and cheese, all you need it the 1/4 tsp garlic salt, and I do love my salt!

Made for breakfast this morning .....and the family loved it. I omitted the ham and butter. Subbed fresh baby spinach for the broccoli and also added some diced red pepper.  I also used egg substitute with a splash of skim milk. Very tasty and healthy.  Served with whole wheat toast.  Thanks!

Excellent base recipe for a frittata! I made a few changes - I did not have broccoli so I substituted 1 package of frozen spinach.  I also omitted the mushrooms. I used tomato-basil chicken sausage instead of the ham and 1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese instead of the cheddar cheese.  The goat cheese gave the frittata a creamy texture.  I browned the sausage before placing it in the bottom of the dish and then poured the egg/cheese mixture on top.  It took a lot longer to bake - about 55 minutes.  Yum!  I will make this again!

This is absolutely delicious!  Love the dijon!  I used a red bell pepper instead of tomatoes, bacon instead of ham, thyme instead of italian seasoning and chopped up fresh garlic instead of using garlic salt.  A+!

This was absolutely delicious.  I made it without meat for my son who is a vegetarian, substituting a couple of diced zucchini from the farm stand.  Instead of Italian seasoning, I used Herbes de Provence which is a little milder.  Thank you for posting it!  =)

Very easy and super tasty!  My neighbor's ducks laid about 18 eggs so we needed a good way to use them up, and this was perfect.  Substituted fresh spinach leaves for the broccoli and added about half an orange bell pepper.  Sauteed onions and mushrooms together first, added peppers and ham just to warm through and then wilted the spinach on the warm mixture before mixing with egg mixture.   It did take longer to bake, maybe 35 minutes.  Do not leave out the dijon, it was great!

Excellent! Used Canadian Bacon vice ham, and Tuscan veggie mix with broccoli, mushrooms, peppers and onions. Also added 4 large shrimp (for 2 servings). Also, I don't use garlic salt. Substituted chopped fresh garlic. This recipe is made for customizing over and over! Thanks!

This was really delicious. I didn't have any broccoli, so I added some yellow pepper and increased the mushrooms. I used turkey pepperoni instead of ham and it was really tasty. Following another suggestion, I used olive oil instead of butter and it was fine. I also mixed the cheddar with some white aged Balderson cheddar.
I have to say the prep time was longer than 5 minutes. There is no way you can chop fry and whisk all of those ingredients in 5 minutes. The cooking time was bang on. 
Very delicious. My husband even said I could make it for my inlaws - and that is saying something!

Really liked this. Made it vegetarian so skipped the ham. Also used 2% cheese to cut down on calories. Tasted great. Only reason not a 5 is slightly bland - need a little more seasoning somewhere.

What is great about this dish is that basically you can substitute the first five ingredients for just about anything.  Whoever here said this is a great dish to make on the day before you do groceries was right on!  The mustard/Italian seasoning/garlic salt combo is indispensable in this recipe - and if you leave those guys out...you'll have just a basic frittata.  Family-approved!

Quick and simple! It can be modified to one's taste or done with what you already have in the kitchen.  You can probably season it alittle more if it's too bland. :)

You can also: add fresh rosemary and thyme instead of Italian seasoning, add sweet or redskin potatoes (parboil til soft), exchange spinach for broccoli, add more salt and pepper.

Awesome!  We leave out the meat and make as is using tomato, spinach, mushrooms, and red bell peppers.  We up the servings to six and it takes about 45 minutes to cook.  Great to make the night before and heat pieces up the next morning.

Very good! I combined this with the bacon cheese frittata and made two pans, one without cheese for my dairy-free guest. The one with cheese took slightly longer to cook.

I have made this a gazillion times - it is THE BEST breakfast egg casserole you could ever hope for - really!  I do adjust to fit the tastes of my guests - skip mushrooms - add peppers; don't like ham - add sausage; this would work vegan just as well.  My advice is just don't skimp om the cheese or the seasonings!  Please ENJOY!!!

The dijon is way too overpowering in this dish.  I would suggested only a few tablespoons or less.
