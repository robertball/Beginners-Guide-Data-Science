I used Cherry Jell-O and sprinkled with multi-colored Betty Crocker Party Sugar instead.  I got lots of requests for the recipe at work.  They weren't too sweet, a little salty (which I like)and the cherry flavor jell-o added a familar taste to the cookies, but people could not guess what it was.  Definately will make again!

This is my recipe, and I want to mention a few things I forgot when I submitted it.  DON"T use sugar free gelatin!  It will totally change the taste of the cookies, the same for using most sugar substitutes for the sugar in the recipe.  Keep different flavors of cookies in different storage bags until ready to put them on a plate or whatever to serve, the flavors will mingle and make some interesting tasting cookies.  Put them in an airtight container as soon as cool, or they will become quite crisp (unless you like crisp cookies!)

Some of the coolest Christmas cookies ever!  I usually make one batch of strawberry or raspberry and one of lime, so you have red and green!  Everyone loves them.

The taste of these cookies is surprising!  Really delicious.  I made them for my
daughter's class in their school colors using grape and lemon jello.  The kids
loved them.

Very simple recipe.  Used Splenda instead of sugar and made with strawberry jello.  Decorated them for Christmas.  My eldest said he could taste the salt but I like a cookie that is not too sweet and it must not have bothered him by the amount he ate.  Youngest went nuts over them.  If I would have had time, I would have made a batch with Lime jello which would have been very pretty next to the strawberry.  Oh well, next time.  
_____________________________________
12/19   Just wanted to add a note.  We enjoyed these fresh from the oven the day they were  made but nobody would eat them after a day or two of them sitting.  The jello taste was so strong and fake tasting that they did not go over well.

4 stars for easiness and kid-friendly recipe, 3 stars for taste.  I will make these again for a kid audience, but have better recipes for adults palettes. 

I substituted butter for the shortening, and it worked well.  Used strawberry jello this time.  Like another reviewer, I would like to make more colors when I have more time.

These are pretty good. Definitely 4star for easiness and speed. Flavor 3 1/2 to 4star. These are cookies with kid appeal and would be sweet in a variety of colors. I made red and green for christmas and they will look cute with the other cookies I am serving. I think the flavor would be better if you added in some butter in place of some of the shortening.

Wow! I made these as a Christmas gift for our neighbors and they are still raving about them! I used a really chunky sugar (Zulka brand) and drew designs like snowflakes and snowmen on them with simple powdered sugar frosting. So simple, and such a big hit - we'll be making these again in the future... and again and again and again.

Tried twice to get a good taste. Both times the cookies tasted very salty and disgusting.

They tasted great! The edges were a little cracked because I added an ingredient at the wrong time. Nonetheless, the taste is all that matters and the taste could only be described as one thing: DELICIOUS!!

I was looking for an easy cookie recipe that was sort of festive and this seemed to fit the bill.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and the cookies came out quite bland.  Also, I expected them to naturally flatten a bit while cooking but they didn't.  So, when it says flatten the cookies, it REALLY means flatten them.  

I'm not sure how to make these cookies less bland.  Perhaps add more sugar or even some brown sugar.

These didn't really turn out when i put them in. When I tried to get them out with my spatula, they just turned into gel like things.

Same as the old jello cookie recipe, only they called for butter. Other than that, exactly the same. Memory serves it was on the old Jell-o box from the 60's or so. Still a favorite in my house. I make them for snacks for the kids. My mom made them for me. Strawberry is still the fav. here.
