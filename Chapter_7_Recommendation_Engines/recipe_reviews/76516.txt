Thank you Crystal!!

This recipe is amazing!  It's easy and quick to prepare and it tastes great.  On top of that, the texture is light and the pie crust holds it's form beautifully - so no crumbling and falling apart.  I used it for a pumpkin pie I made last night and fed to my friends for a thanksgiving feast and they LOVED it! (None of them are gluten intolerant or coeliac, by the way).  Thanks Again :)

Soy flour gives this recipe a horrible aftertaste. The texture was great, but it tasted very strongly of soy.

Thank you Crystal for this wonderful gluten free pie crust. I made a pumpkin pie with this recipe for Thanksgiving and my boyfriend who is gluten intolerant was very impressed... he doesn't get to eat pie very often. Even those that aren't gluten intolerant enjoyed this nutty pie crust and it was so easy to make!

This recipe was awesome. I made it with a ricotta cheese pie recipe and it was phenomenal!!!!!!!!! I LOVE the flavor of pie crust and this didn't let me down!! One note...I used rice flour instead of soy flour (my husband does the shopping and thought the rice flour "looked better" LOL). It STILL turned out excellent! Thanks for sharing~

I tried this for a banana cream pie for my gluten-free husband.  I used Bob's Redmill general pupose baking flour instead of soy flour.  I don't think that was a problem.  There was no conceivable way to roll this into a piecrust.  I did, however, press it into the pie plate.  It did brown up just like regular pie crust though.  I did not care for the overpowering taste of the macadamia nuts.  They are best eaten in small doses if you ask me and for $5 a bottle, I'll try another recipe.  thanks for the effort though

I cannot believe other people gave this so many stars.  I tried it with a variety of toppings, it was not good with any of them.  My family agreed.  Sorry, not worth the effort on this one!

I was happy to find this recipe when I was looking for a pie crust to put with some apple pie for my gluten intolerant mother-in-law. I think I may have messed up and left out about 1/2 of the nuts, so this may be my own fault, but I didn't like to initial flavor, so I added about a tsp of cinnamon to the crust. I thought it rolled out just fine. I tried making a pretty edge to the crust, which was easy to do, but would not cut through at the edges, so I don't recommend doing that. Also, this seemed a little soggy under the filling and not crispy and flaky. I am going to try this again with a pecan pie, making sure I use the right amount of nuts this time to see if that makes a difference.

Great!  It was a hit with everyone that tried it!  The pie I made (peanut butter) and the macadamia nuts were a great combo!  I will definitely make this again!

I used it as a dessert pie crust.  Never again.  My husband and I will eat anything, but we couldn't eat the pie because the crust tasted so bad.  Maybe it would be better used in a pot pie or quiche...

I used 5 ounces of Macadamia nuts because that's the only size bag the grocery store sold, and I used some tapioca flour that I had on hand instead of the soy, and it came out great. I was the only Celiac at our Thanksgiving dinner, but everybody liked this pie crust. If you dislike soy as I do, try tapioca. For the reviewer who said it was soggy, remember this recipie is for pre-baked crust.

For the record, it was a chocolate pudding pie.

This is a pretty good pie crust. I used buckwheat flour instead of soy. It tastes like macadamia nuts when eating it on its own. Itâ€™s cake-like more than flaky. It rolls out quite easily, too. Use wet hands when handling. It gets sticky. I used it for mini-tart pans. It fit eight of them. Thank you for the recipe.
