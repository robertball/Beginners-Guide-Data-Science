Dill!!!! Skip the Italian Seasoning and marjoram and add plenty of dill weed in addition to the salt and pepper. I add 1 14oz can of stewed tomatoes to the leaf lined pan before I pack the stuffed leaves in, and 1 more over the top before I cover them up with more cabbage leaves. I too make large batches, because my family can smell them cooking from miles away!

I love this dish.  My grandma used to make these for me as a kid and I have been making them myself as an adult.  I agree that making a lot at once is the best way because the prep time is time consuming but it is worth it.  And they freeze very well!

I’m of Polish heritage, and I love making foreign foods. I have to say, this made me proud of my heritage. It’s delicious, and I’m certainly going to make it again.

Most Polish recipes will call for ground pork, not beef. To make it more authentic, skip the canned soups unless you like the MSG flavor in your food.  Add water to the pan to keep them juicy.

I've always loved cabbage rolls and these are really good! A couple tweaks mostly for diet choices... butter instead of margarine, vegetable stock instead of canned soup, added some dried thyme and rosemary to enhance the flavour a bit, replaced the canned mushroom soup with sautéed mushrooms, and as a couple other reviewers (and as Grandma would suggest) I added stewed tomatoes.

I make mine true to Babci's recipe, except i add a few pinches crushed red pepper (sorry babci, its for the anti oxidants). Her recipe calls for 1cup rice (cooked) for each pound of meat, and aways in stewed tomatoes .
