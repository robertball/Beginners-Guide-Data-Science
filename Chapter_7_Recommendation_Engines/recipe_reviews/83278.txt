Easy to make, but just so-so for taste, but then I am not a big white chocolate fan. They look cute, so I might try them again at Christmas with a plain (no food coloring added) cookie and dark chocolate or mint chocolate chips.  I only had a 2 inch ribbon disk in my cookie press kit, which turned out to be too big.  If I made them again, I would try and find a smaller disk to pipe the dough with.  Also, you will need 2 small bottles of sprinkles to dip all the cookies in.  One in definitely not enough.

Super cute! It did take a long time to decorate so plan on more prep time. I did not use enough food coloring so next time I will do 3 red drops and 15 yellow to get it the right color of orange.

This is probably the best spritz I've ever made. Since I was making it for Halloween, I split the dough in half and dyed one half bright orange and the other a deep purple. When assembling them, I made all the cookies half orange, half purple. I then used bright green sprinkles. They turned out beautiful. For those who think they're a little rich or too sweet, try not dipping them into the white chocolate and sprinkles after they're assembled. They're great just as a standard sandwich cookie. I used the advice from some of the reviewers to increase the sugar and I think it helped the taste. These are wonderful and versatile for any holiday. Will try with dark chocolate next time for Christmas.

I was so looking forward to these because they're so pretty! But all that confectioner's sugar made them very chalky and not very flavorful. But they were pretty.

Good cookies with great texture, but there is not a lot of flavor to be found. Very cute though, just not enough to wow someone beyond presentation.

I like them.  Festive and you can get creative.  A bit time consuming.  It would probably be a lot easier with a cookie press.  I did use a piping bag because it is what I had.  They turned out good, but not as pretty as pictured.

These cookies are delicious. To cut down on frosting and decorating time, I don't frost & sandwich the cookies. I just take and dip about 1/2 of the cookie in any flavor of melted chips and dip in bowl of sprinkles. Use other disks and make a variety of shapes and do the same thing and dip 1/2 the cookie in melted chips and sprinkles too.  These are definitely a favorite.

I wanted to make these cookies to do something more creative-the dough should be refridgerated at least a half hour to keep its form from the cookiespress- mine all ran together and they were cakey not crunchy. They were a great taste with the added chocolate. I may try again for XMAS cookies and I will refridgerate tis time.

These cookies are great and were fairly easy to make.  I probably spent closer to 45 minutes making them, not 26.  Next time I would split the white chocolate in half and melt it seperately.  While my sandwich cookies were chilling for 10 minutes in the fridge, my melted chocolate that I needed for dipping was starting to harden.

I have made these 3 years in a row for Christmas and I love them. I am a big white chocolate fan and because the cookies aren't super sweet it's a perfect balance. These are either a hit or miss with friends and family, but with this type of cookie it's either you love it or it's so so...but for me, love it all the way!!!
