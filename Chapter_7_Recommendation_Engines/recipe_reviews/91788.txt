I use this recipe alot. Instead of the egg whites, I use 1 egg and 2 egg whites.  Most of the time I cut the chocolate chips down to 1/4 cup.  Sometimes after the brownies are cooked, I sprinkle chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and chopped pecans, equaling about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of mixture.  Then I pour heated caramel topping over to melt it.

Very surprised and pleased. A very good base for lots of possibilities.  I think they are a little "flat"..not as "thick" as some brownies, but I will definitely make these again. Love that they are low fat.  YUM.
