I've been eating this dip practically since birth and I was thrilled to see a recipie for it online. The inventor of this recipie was a man named Harold Miklethwaite. He was a Paris trained chef who owned and operated Harold's restaurant in Portsmouth Ohio from the early 60's until his death I believe in the mid 90's. Harold had a wicked sense of humor and he often said that his lips looked like a ducks bill. The logo for his restaurant was a duck in a tux, so naturally a good name for his dip was duck butter which was always the first thing the waiter placed on your table with a big basket of Melba toast. I moved to California in the late 70's, but always look back upon my youth fondly in southern Ohio and the great meals from Harold's restaurant.

Edit: As somebody else mentioned it makes a great spread on sandwiches. I made French dip roast beef sandwiches and it was outstanding on them. I've also tried it on grilled burgers and the result was equally as delicious. You can leave the salt out if you want because the ingredients and whatever you put the spread on will also be salty. It is very strong with just crackers, but the flavor on a sandwich or burger is perfect.

This was pretty good as a dip, my family enjoyed it. However, when I put it on broiled roast beef sandwiches, it was fantastic! I would use it again as a spread, but probably not as a dip.

I love the overall taste of this spread. Either I put in too much salt or the recipe called for too much because it was way too salty.  I would suggest tasting it before adding all the sal and keep in mind that the crackers you serve with it will probably be salted also. I will make it again.

I add extra blue cheese because I really enjoy that flavor.  I don't add any hot sauce or salt, and only use 3 teaspoons of worcestershire and 2 Tablespoons of minced onion - otherwise you lose the blue cheese flavor completely!

I've made this several times and never gotten around to rating it.  It's great as a spread with wheat thins, club crackers, actually any cracker with do. Not overpowering with blue cheese. Even friends who don't like blue cheese like this spread.

I thought this was very good.  If you like blue cheese, then you will like this recipe.  I served it with crackers and fresh veggies.  The one downside is that it isn't the most visually appealing dip - it turns out somewhat gray colored.  But in my opinion (and my guests)taste easily won out!

I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone enjoyed it.  next time I would add a bit more hot sauce and the one change I did make was I rolled it into a ball and let it sit in the fridge over night and the next day I rolled in chopped walnuts and served with crackers

We liked the taste of this dip but it really is quite strong.  I might add another 4 oz. cream cheese next time to make it a bit milder and reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. We're not usually sensitive to salt but found this to be quite salty!

I made this to bring to a party and was really worried because I thought it to be a bit too strong.  I was proven wrong - it was the hit of the party!  It doesnt seem to make a lot, but not to worry, it goes a long way.  Perfect dip!  :)

I searched for this recipe for years as well.  I found variations online for blue cheese dips from the 60s and 70s.  I think Harold, the originator of this recipe, used local ingredients he could find in our small Ohio town, resulting in a salty but delicious dip I enjoyed while growing up. You need buttery crackers or melba toast  for the original recipe.  Instead of Worcestershire, I use brandy or a flavored liquor. Doing this lowers the saltiness.  Also, try subbing creme fraiche for the cream cheese. This dip is great with cocktails!

Made this as a dip with crackers and veggies for book club.   Seemed to be a hit and my husband loved it!  (Actually served it with assorted crackers and carrots since the two heads of broccoli I just bought didn't look fresh or appealing!)  I had intended to serve with vegetable straws but decided it was too thick.  My gal pals seemed to go for the carrots instead of the crackers.  To me, seemed a bit heavy on the garlic and onion (I used purple) but I don't eat either of those.  After reading reviews about the salt and the color I didn't add any salt and instead of 1/8 tsp. of Tabasco Sauce, I used about 2 tsp.  of sriracha sauce.  This gave the dip a light peach color, not gray at all.  I will definitely make this again. 
Tomorrow night we are trying this on burgers as another reviewer suggested.  Next time I will serve with more veggies.  If served with crackers, it could use a knife for spreading.

Have made twice and like to add a couple more ounces blue cheese and increase hot sauce to 1 tablespoon.  For the life of me I can not figure out how to get the color as orange as the picture. I did notice by only blending/combining the blue cheese was less gray color. Any suggestions form anyone to get to orange?

Yummy.  I added 3 extra ounces of cream cheese, but that is the only change that I made.  Served with original flavor bagel chips.  This is a keeper!
