PERFECT bowl of oatmeal!!! Mine was not thin as the recipe states, but  ended up being the exact thickness that I prefer my oatmeal.   No changes or adjustments needed. This is a keeper! YUM!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is good, however, I reduced the sugar to 1 tsp. and eliminated the salt. I also sometimes add 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed and either blueberries or sliced banana.

Delicious. I don't know why people insist on making oatmeal with water when milk makes it so much creamier. Yum!

I am Dominican and oatmeal is a kind of great breakfast for me... You can substitute milk by fat free evaporated milk and or you can add 1 or 2 tsp of cocoa.

Creamy and tasty. This made an excellent breakfast. I wanted more of a cereal than a beverage so I upped the oats to 3/4 c. and that was perfect.

Delicious- I make all hot cereal recipes( oats, oatbran, cream of wheat etc.) with milk rather than water & then I serve with cream! Calories be damned! May I recommend steel-cut oats for when you have more time (approx. 30 min), perhaps on the weekend

This was so delicious.  Creamy, satisfying and just right.  I made one serving, just for me, to test it out.  I can't say how much I think this is the perfect oatmeal recipe as is.   I imagine you can leave out the salt and/or add different fruits and still have it just be a great oatmeal base, too.

I never cared for oatmeal breakfast until I tried this recipe. This recipe makes a perfect consistency between beverage and porridge. The taste is wonderful.

I'm dominican and this is just like my grandma used to make for me when I was kid. Perfect consistency and just the right amount of sweetness, though I do like to add another spoonful of sugar if I have a sweet tooth. I love this recipe

This was pretty good.  I messed up and it came out a little too thick.  If I make it again I will definitely use less oats than I did.

I doubled this recipe for my two boys and I and I made this in my rice cooker. I used fat free evaporated milk instead of regular milk for a creamier texture. This oatmeal turned out perfectly. Very creamy with just the right amount of sweetness. Next time, I'll make this with a half cup of raisins thrown in.

Very YUMMY!  My 5 year old loved it, however she said "it's a little too sweet mama"!  I was shocked, but agreed. Next time I'll cut the sugar down to 1 tblsp.

This is my favorite Oatmeal recipe. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and added dried cranberries. The tartness of the cranberries balanced the sweetness of the oatmeal nicely.

I thought this was delicious! I'm not a fan of milk and usually don't like oatmeal because it's too dry. But the consistency of this was great. I will definitely make it again.

I just found my new favorite breakfast! I substituted with quick-cooking steel cut oats, which makes it heartier rather than liquidy, and soy slender vanilla soy milk. I also added a pat of butter when it was done. The combination of spices is perfect.

Very good. I halved the recipe and used two Splenda packets instead of one Tbsp. of suger. I may try 1-1/2 tsp. of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend next time, and the cocoa idea sounds good,too.  Definately a really good base recipe that has lots of room for variety!  No reason you can't mix up the dry ingredients and separate into individual serving bags so the kids can make their own "instant" oatmeal in the microwave, either!

yummy....I did just what it said and I added a very ripe peach (skinned and diced) while it was cooking...peaches and cream!  

I always made oat meal with water (probably 'cause it's cheaper) and then in individual bowls added butter and milk, sugar....well cooking this way is much creamer and I feel uses less sugar because of the richness of the milk and no butter!  

I would make cream of wheat the same way with water until my husband cooked it in milk instead and added vanilla...well wow, the best cream of wheat ever...except a little to thick so sense then I've always made it half milk/ half water and it's perfect, a little splash of milk in the end is always nice too...and butter and sugar.....

But this oatmeal is Delicious, I won't give up the other 100's of ways to cook OATS but I will make this often, I LOVE OATS all different ways.  Thanks you for this simple, easy, deliciousness comforting way!

So good! The perfect bowl of oatmeal. I sprinkled dried berries on top and they were a nice touch.  I always used water in my oatmeal before this but now I know I'll always use milk, it's so much better!

Extremely tasty and easy to make. It was very creamy, had a great consistency and the spices went together nicely. I've always made my oatmeal with water; after trying this recipe I don't think I'll ever make it with water again!

So easy--why wouldn't I always make my oatmeal this way? Well, now I am. Yum!

This is southern style also.   I have cooked it like this for years.  I even will sometimes put in raisens  or diced apple.  It is very good these ways also.

I loved this! It came out very thick and creamy, and the flavor was delicious. I had to resist adding some cold milk and brown sugar to the top out of habit, it didn't need it though I do think it would have been yummy with it too. This was a very good bowl of oatmeal!

This is the best oatmeal recipe!  I've been making this for my husband for several years now.  Since we discovered this recipe, it's the only one we ever use.  I make 15 packets of the dry ingredients at a time, in ziploc sandwich bags.  We use Quaker Quick 1-minute oats. We reduced the milk to 1 cup, and we microwave it for about 2 minutes (watch carefully though). The recipe says it's 2 servings, but it's 1 serving for my husband, and he eats it as is, or adds nuts, fruit, raisins, etc.

Made this with regular oats and skim milk and no sugar.  Took a little longer to cook, but had great results.  Had a creamy consistency that reminds me of rice pudding.   We topped it with brown sugar and fresh blueberries.  No additional milk needed. Even my oatmeal hater liked this one!

I'm not a huge oatmeal fan, but this is definitely the way I will be preparing oatmeal for the foreseeable future.  Delicious.  Add a little bit of dried fruit or some nuts for some variety.

I am a big fan of nutmeg, and was surprised that I had never tried adding it to my morning oatmeal.  Since I am the only oatmeal eater in the house, I scaled this down to one serving.  I probably used a little more than a pinch of nutmeg, and topped this with my usual raisins and walnuts.  This turned out much creamier compared to using water to cook the oatmeal.  Thanks!

This makes a really nice bowl of oatmeal, but I was expecting it to be a bit more liquidy than it turned out.  It had a good consistency and good flavor, but I think both could be a bit better.  Best homemade bowl of oatmeal I've ever made, though!

Knowing my mom had never been to the Dominican Republic I have no idea where she got her recipe or how they got her's.  I was raised on oatmeal made this way.  I do use brown sugar on occasion and have thrown in some raisins or dates at times, but other than that this is a tried n true recipe of mine.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I usually boil my oatmeal in some water and a pinch of salt. Then, when it is done I top it with some milk and a little butter and sugar. I am always looking for new ways to try things. I cut the recipe in half to make 1 serving. I found it interesting that the oats were cooked in milk. I only had old fashioned oats, and not quick oats, and it didn't seem to be a problem.  It is a tad more sweet then I like my oatmeal, but I can always adjust that next time. The added  cinnamon and nutmeg was tasty.

Thank you for this recipe!  So simple and so delicious. It has revolutionized our oatmeal breakfasts.  I use 2 T. of maple syrup instead of sugar, whole milk, and add a 15 oz. can of sliced peaches in pear juice (cut up into chunks) to make it peaches and cream oatmeal.  Even my picky little eater loves it--YUMMY!!

This recipe was delicious. I didn't have quick cooking oats so I used original oats and it still turned out fine. I just cooked the oats for 5 mins instead of 2. Also, I noticed it was looking more watery than I liked, so I decided to use 3/4 cups of oats instead of 1/2 cup and kept everything else the same. I would probably use slightly less sugar next time as well, perhaps 1.5 tablespoons instead.

Creamy and comforting, made it exactly as written and would not change a thing. Why make oatmeal with water when milk (even 1% milk like I used) makes it so satisfying.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really great oatmeal! I've always had a hard time making oatmeal that tasted just right, but this recipe has taken the guess work out for me! Adding the salt was genius! Not too much salt though...and I only used 2tsp brown sugar...and I added vanilla since it goes so well with cinnamon & nutmeg! This was very tasty, and will become a staple breakfast item...thanks!

I will make this again tomorrow because I made 2 servings but my picky 2 year old ate my serving; so it must be great.  I cannot wait to try tomorrow.  The smell was great and it thickens at it cools so do not be worried about thinness.  Cook extra long so the oats can absorb as much as possible.  Thanks for the Dominican formula.

Great oatmeal!  This is a nice boost of flavor compared to your everyday oatmeal.  Personally i don't use all that sugar though, just my preference.

I followed other comments and used 3/4 C oatmeal because I like mine thick.  I also used soy milk and only added 1tbs sugar.  Turned out amazing!  I will definitely be making oatmeal like this from now on.

Really great flavor and texture! Only problem I had was a slight burning on the bottom of the pan. I would suggest not being impatient like me and bringing it to a boil more slowly. :)

This was pretty good but the combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt was a little strange. Next time I will try leaving the salt out and see if it makes it better.

This is so good!! I have a dairy allergy so I made it with almond milk, doubled the recipe, added 3 TBLS Splenda   instead of the doubled 4 sugar, and I added raisins to cook with the oatmeal. It just made 2 generous servings-- We loved it. Thanks for a super tasty recipe!

I have never been an oatmeal fan but, since discovering this recipe, I've been eating it at least once a week! 
This is definitely the oatmeal recipe for those of us who shy away from bland, healthy food and need to trick ourselves into eating it. ;) 

I sometimes get creative with this recipe and use honey, brown sugar, vanilla sugar, pumpkin spice, or maple sugar in place of some of the ingredients. But it is awesome just the way it is too!

Not bad! I enjoyed this on a chilly Sunday morning, I may have used too much nutmeg but otherwise this was a good recipe, I added a little more oats to make it a little thicker and a touch of honey when it was all done! Tasty :)

The taste and texture of oatmeal I've been searching for! Insanely delicious.  I meant to take a picture to post but ate it all too quickly! This will be my go-to breakfast.  In fact, I can't wait until tomorrow morning to make more.  (And cooked in 2 minutes! It can't be beat).  I made no changes.  It is perfect as written.

This is the perfect oatmeal for people who think they don't like oatmeal! I wanted to like oatmeal, but never could enjoy it any of the times I had tried it in the past. I'm so glad I decided to give oatmeal one more try and found this recipe! The only change I make is to use brown sugar instead of white. I also pre-measured the dry ingredients and put them in Tupperware containers. That way on a busy morning all I have to do is add the milk and cook for 2 minutes. This is now one of my favorite breakfast options. Thank you so much!

I followed the recipe (almost) exactly and loved it...such a different texture than 'normal' oatmeal.  I added a teaspoon of cocoa as one reviewer suggested as that is also typical of Dominican oatmeal...great suggestion.  Thank you for the recipe.  We ate ours with a little bit of milk added on top just as we do with.  I will definitely make this often!!  : )

This recipe makes a great bowl of oatmeal! I use a bit less liquid in mine, because I like it a little thicker, but it's really good either way! I like to add a drizzle of honey before serving sometimes, but I also think this would be awesome with raisins or other fruit mixed in.

I personally would use half milk and half water the next time I make this. Too milky for my taste. Seasoning was good. We added chopped walnuts and would definitely do that again. Good dish overall.

I'm an oatmeal beginner and really enjoyed this recipe.  I'm used to the little packets of oatmeal you can buy at the store and they are really sweet.  This wasn't nearly so sweet, so I was surprised at how much I loved it.  Happy day! Thanks for sharing!

We LOVE this oatmeal!  We follow the recipe almost exactly, and it tastes so good!  Our daughter requests it several times a week.  The only tweak we make, for personal preference, is to cut the sugar back.  Mmmm...

Only use minimal nutmeg. Too much is very overpowering. Also cut the sugar in half, unless you like it very sweet.

I didn't have nutmeg the first time I made this for breakfast so I used 1/3 a cap of vanilla extract. I drizzle honey over it in the mornings and eating it cold is also delicious!

If you aren't a fan of creamy oatmeal, you will not like this recipe.  But!  If you love creamy oatmeal (as I do) this is a winner.  I change up the spices with cardamom, etc. often.

We all love this recipe at home! Tastes delicious and just like I remember while growing up in the Bronx. Now that I am grown up with kids and moved away to the south. I love to make them some of my original favorite meals for them to enjoy.

First tried this about a year ago and have enjoyed it many times since.  Creamy and soothing with just the perfect amount of sweetness.  Love the addition of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I have tried homemade oatmeal several other ways prior to discovering this recipe and not liked it nearly as much - before trying this I preferred the instant oatmeal packets to making it from scratch.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is by far the best oatmeal recipe I've ever had.  It's the perfect breakfast comfort food, and I love it so much that I've pre-mixed the dry ingredients into single servings in ziplock baggies, and all I do is measure the milk, stir the mix in, and boil.  I had a similar-tasting bowl of cream of wheat while vacationing in the Caribbean, and have been searching ever since for a recipe that has the same ever-so-slightly-spiced flavor... and I've finally found it.

EDIT 8/5/14 - My husband (who never used to like oatmeal before this recipe) likes to make this with 50% more cinnamon, and brown sugar instead of white sugar.  It tastes even better this way!

I use steel cut oats. Just simmer on low for about 15 minutes. I also use Splenda Brown sugar in place of the white sugar & add apples & raisins. Healthy and so good.

Yes!!!!!!!! This recipe is awesome! I haven't had oatmeal like this since pre school. Lol if you stir for 2 minutes, it's still too watery. I stirred for a few minutes more until I reached my desired consistency... Thick and creamy. I don't think I can go back to water based oatmeal.

This is a great recipe either as a base with some add ins or on its own. On its own, it might quite possibly be the best oatmeal that I've had in awhile.  After enjoying the oatmeal according the recipe I tried adding in about 1/2 a cup of canned pumpkin and it was so good.  I also tried it another day with banana slices in it. I really like it because it's a very versatile recipe.  It's a little sweet, but that's the way I like it.  If you don't like your oatmeal so sweet, maybe reduce the sugar or add honey instead.

I've never really been a huge fan of oatmeal, I always thought it to taste kind of bland. Nevertheless, I decided to give this recipe a try, and I think I may become an oatmeal lover! I love the simplicity (as I pretty much always have these ingredients on hand) as well as the versatility. I made mine with a little less sugar, and sliced up a slightly ripened banana, and it was absolutely fantastic. It's quick, simple, nutritious, and tastes great. What more could you ask for?

This recipe is the perfect bowl of basic cinnamon oatmeal.  To streamline the morning breakfast routine, I separate 2-portion mix into jars and just pour into the pot and add milk in the morning.  Every little bit of time saved matters!  Thanks for the great, money-saving recipe.

This oatmeal was delicious! The only change I made was I used 1/2 plain Almond milk and 1/2 vanilla almond milk, due to milk allergies.  Also added blueberries half way through cooking. I will definitely make this often.  Great recipe!

Yum! I added 1Granny Smith Apple peeled, cored, and in 1\2- inch dice.  I also doubled the cinnamon and did half regular sugar and half brown sugar.   Served it topped with chopped walnuts.  I will use this again!  I did not feel like it lacked flavor.

Delicious!  Perfect oatmeal. Nice and light, with just enough flavor.  I made it according to the recipe, but substituted unsweetened plain almond milk for milk.  Next time I'm going to try adding 1-2 tsp cocoa, as one reviewer suggested, and then possibly try sweetening with honey instead of sugar.

I have been making oatmeal like this for years and love it.  I use half water and half milk. I like to simmer a  cinnamon stick in water before adding milk and other ingredients.  The original recipe as written is very good.

INSTANT POT APPROVED. I keep a pre-mix of the ingredients (except milk and oatmeal). Prepare the Instant Pot with 2 cups of water and the steamer basket.In a small heat-proof bowl or mug, add ingredients . Close and lock the lid and set the valve to "seal".Pressure Cook for 3 minutes at high pressure.Disengage the “keep warm” mode or unplug the cooker and open when the pressure indicator has gone down (7 to 15 minutes). Mix the contents of the bowl and enjoy. Everything with one bowl and spoon. Awesome!!

I enjoyed this recipe. I used homemade almond milk, coconut sugar, and added 1 diced apple. It turned out a bit too thick, so I'll add more almond milk or a touch of water next time.

Have never been a big oatmeal fan, but this recipe made me a convert!  Our of this world good.  So creamy and the spice was just perfect.  The nutmeg was amazing in this dish.  Have made it twice since trying it out last week.  I have eight houseguests coming for a weekend later this month and this will be on the menu for sure!

This is a GREAT recipe for oatmeal. I'm not a big oatmeal fan but eat it for a change and to keep from getting sugary pancakes or greasy bacon/sausage. I actually enjoyed this recipe. I did make some changes but the original recipe is great. I prefer a thicker base so I only used 1 & 1/4 milk and cut the sugar to 1 tablespoon. My modified version and the original deserves 5 stars.

I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, and it was nice and creamy. I only used 1 T sugar, and that was more than enough. After cooking for 2 minutes as indicated, it was very thin. But after it sat in the bowl for a couple minutes, it was still loose, but a more spoonable consistency. I threw in some walnuts and ate the whole 2 servings for a nice, filling breakfast.

This recipe was delicious. I made a few modifications. I reduced the sugar to a half tablespoon per serving and added 1/4 a cup of blueberries per serving. I also made this in Sunday night for the whole weak in smaller Tupperwares, one per day. Easy to grab and put into the microwave for two minutes before work.

I grew up eating Oatmeal made with milk. I recently started using steel cut oats, which I soak in milk and water before I make it. I use vanilla extract in addition to the sugar (organic cane) and sea salt. I put a little bit of butter and let it sit. When cooked, top with cinnamon. Puerto Rican.

This oatmeal is delicious! I like thicker oatmeal, so I added more oats and it turned into paste. I added more milk and it was back the consistency I like. I also added dried cranberries like another reviewer did. Yum!

LOVED IT!!! It was perfectly creamy and full of flavor. I love it with blueberries or raspberries. Only problem was that it left a horrible black burnt  ring around my pot. Would make it more often if   I wasn't concerned about it ruining my pots.

It is prettty good, a litttle bland for my taste. But it was very easy to make. I had to add a little more oatmeal, because I like my oatmeal thick. But Overall, this oatmeal is pretty good!

I made this recipe exactly as written. The oatmeal was very easy and quick to put together. It is very creamy, which we really liked. We also loved the cinnamon and nutmeg. We topped our oatmeal with chopped apples, dried cranberries, and pecan pieces. I served it with my homemade banana bread.  This will become a regular breakfast item in our house. 

By the way, we also enjoyed the leftovers warm up in the microwave with a little cream stirred in to thin it. We even ate it for lunch.

Wonderful recipe! I quadrupled it for a big crowd and my mom added the zest of an orange to it. It was a great addition, but this recipe is good either way.

SUPER easy, ready in no time.
I LOVED it. although I replaced smashed walnut instead 
of nutmeg and honey instead of sugar I had the most fun with cinnamon and salt.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it way to sweet.  I'd try it again with maybe one or two teaspoons of sugar.

I love this! I've used almond milk and coconut milk in place of regular milk. All 3 types are great, but the coconut takes first place. I also use Truvia instead of regular sugar. My young boys love it and that means a lot. My youngest is a VERY picky eater...

Can't believe I am about to leave 5 stars for a bowl of oatmeal... but prepared as stated, 5 stars!

 Love to add a bit of jam or raisins at the end for an added touch.  Can't wait till I get my hands on some maple sugar....

I have never liked oatmeal before, not even a little bit.  I had to make oatmeal for my dog, and I looked up this recipe just to try it for myself… I love it!!!  I'm so excited that I now enjoy a healthy food I've always missed out on in the past.  The only thing I did differently was less milk, and I topped it off with slices of bananas… yummy!!!!

I really liked this oatmeal. The milk made the texture and taste so good. I added some blueberries on top and this made a very healthy breakfast. I added only a little extra oatmeal because I feared it would be too soupy. Overall this was really good and I will be using this again.

It is delicious! I didn't have cinnamon, so I added a little bit of vanilla extract instead. I also cooked it longer and let it sit covered for 5 minutes for a thicker texture.

We've tried a number of oatmeal recipes and this has been our favorite.

A couple of ideas we've had to make the preparation easier:
1) Cook it in a double boiler. If you cook it directly on the stove, it can burn unless you are stirring often, and so you have to be hovering over the stove for a good while. And if you cook it in the microwave, it can easily boil and overflow. But with a double boiler on medium heat, there's no danger of burning or boiling over; you can basically just leave it there until it's ready, with minimal stirring or hovering. It does take a long time, but you can do other things meanwhile.
2) Use powdered milk. This lets you can pre-mix and store the dry ingredients (we put them in ziploc bags) and just add water when you want to cook it. For 4 servings, it's about 1 cup of powdered milk and 3 cups water.

I made this recipe the same as scribed above.  In the end I topped my oatmeal with berries, almonds, walnuts and raisins.  This oatmeal is too sweat for my tastes, next time I'd use half the sugar and switch for brown sugar.

My kids have never wanted to eat plain oatmeal, and the boxed instant packages are getting too expensive.  We tried this for breakfast this morning, and there wasn't a scrap leftover.  It was very easy and quick to make before school.

This recipe has become a family favorite in the months since we first tried it. We typically use regular oats instead of quick oats ... this means they need to cook a little longer. Stir constantly or you get a yucky pan in the end.

I don't usually like oatmeal but this was very delicious! I used a little less milk than what the recipe called for.

WOW....who would know!  Perfection at its best!  I think I am actually going to be able to get my DH to eat oatmeal again.

The texture pf this oatmeal IS more creamy, but I didn't find it particularly more liquidy. I subbed Splenda for the sugar.
