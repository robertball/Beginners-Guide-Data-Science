So I'm going to rate this cookie in the middle of what was our final verdict!  I thought these were just OK---a 3.  They were good, but they didn't wow me.  BUT my granddaughters just LOVED them!  I think they loved the graham cracker coating so much!  I did follow the recipe exactly, and they didn't exactly crack on top, but they seemed to be done in 10 minutes as suggested.  I did use the optional chocolate chips, though I think they probably aren't necessary at all.  So I'll split these two reviews with a 4.  Kids will love them.

Great cookie, total hit with adults and kids! I gave it a 4 because right off the bat I could tell the dough would be bland. I immediately added vanilla extract and cinnamon, which compliments the Graham cracker flavour, and they were really good.

Good cookies and easy! They were perfect at 9 minutes. I will definitely do this again when I need a fast recipe.
