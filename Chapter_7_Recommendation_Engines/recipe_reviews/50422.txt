This recipe turned out pretty well.  The flavor was great, thus the 5 stars.  I did make a few changes, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to the fruit mixture.  Even after letting it sit for 15 minutes after coming out of the oven the filling was still kind of liquidy so I think next time I will use 2 tablespoons cornstarch.  For the topping I used 1/4 cup brown sugar splenda blend.  I also think that a few more minutes of baking time would have been better to ensure that the rhubarb was tender.  But I'm definitely keeping this recipe.  It's absolutely delicious.  I had to convince my husband to not eat it all in one sitting!

Excellent recipe! I have made it with strawberries and rhubarb, and also as strawberries and apples. I did not add honey to the fruit mixture - but I did microwave the fruit for about 8-10 minutes - to soften it a bit - otherwise I have found that the rhubarb or the apples have stayed too firm but I couldn't leave it in the oven any longer for fear it might burn. I use canola oil instead of the margering in the crunch topping. Usually I use 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce to reduce the fat in the crunch and it does not come out soggy. I also make 4x the topping and spread 1/2 on the bottom of my ceramic dish, fill the middle with the fruit and then sprinkle the top with the rest of the topping. This dish is great served warm or even at room temprature! It freezes well.

This was really great, especially for a healthier version of crisp. I did use an extra tbsp or so of honey because the person I was making it for doesn't like rhubarb  desserts to be too tart. I was glad I did, otherwise it may have been too tart even for me. I added 2 tbsp of cornstarch after reading the previous reviews and it was perfect - not too runny in the least. For the topping I used 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup light margarine and it turned out really well. Delicious with vanilla ice cream!! I'll make this again for sure.

This was delicious.  I made a couple of changes adding 2 Tbs cornstarch for thickning and 2 Tbs Splenda in place of honey for filling.  I also replaced brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar mix.  I am on Weight Watchers and this was equivelent to 4 points at 8 servings.  Add a little low fat topping or ice cream and you will have a dessert that everyone will rave about.

Very easy and quick.

Good recipe. I didn't have any fresh strawberries so I used frozen in tub (with sugar). I still used honey too. But I wished I would have also added 1/4 c sugar. Mine was a little too tart. I did add 2 T cornstarch. Worked great.

Great recipe!  All I would add: it really does need something to thicken the juice from the fruit.  I added a T. of flour and that still wasn't quite enough.  Otherwise, very good summer desert.

What a GREAT way to use Rhubarb and strawberry togeather.  The tablespoon of honey was JUST RIGHT. Was a light, sweet-tart desert.  Only thing that would of made it better would have been if I had ice cream to go on top.  My husband loved it.  Anything made with rhubarb, in our book, is good, and this is excelent.

It is a little tart even though i added an extra tablespoon of honey. I also added two tablespoons of corn starch. The thickness is just right.
Other wise it is just fine!

This needed either flour or cornstarch or tapioca to thicken all of the liquid that resulted from cooking the fruit.  It tasted great, but consistiency left a little to be desired.

This was one of the only things my husband wanted to eat while he was having chemotherapy. He would eat the entire thing in one sitting! I also added a little bit of flour or corn starch to the berries to keep the mixture from getting to soupy, and used agave to sweeten the berries instead of honey. This is also really good with some freshly ground nutmeg added to the berry/rhubarb mix and a little salt added to the topping. All said, simple to make after a day at the hospital and delicious enough to tempt a leukemia patient with no appetite!

Here's my extremely low sugar version:
1) Prepare filling as stated above. 
2) Omit the brown sugar from the topping and add more cinnamon to taste. 
3) Just before putting everything into the oven, drizzle another tablespoon of honey on top.
4) After baking, sprinkle a little (3 packets) Splenda on top. This brings the sugar total waaay down to 9 grams per serving!

This is really good! I feel like 5 stars is for a recipe that knocks my socks off. This is nice, though. I didn't look for this recipe b/c I really wanted lower sugar all around. I wanted less sugar mixed in with the fruit (if that makes sense). I used 2 heaping TBS of honey and microwaved it together with the fruit for 5 minutes to be able to disperse evenly. I also sprinkled some flour on the bottom of the pan as well as in the fruit and it thickened up really nicely. Bake on the lowest rack of the oven and you can cook it longer without fear of it burning. I used the crunch recipe from Cherry Crisp on this site. A great crunch. Fruit is slightly tart, but the taste is more natural than when using a lot of sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

I cut the recipe to 2 servings (1 cup frozen rhubarb and a handful of frozen strawberries), and baked them in individual custard dishes.  I did microwave the fruit for 2 minutes beforehand, which was TOO LONG as the final product was a bit mushy.  I didn't use cornstarch; I stuck with the original ingredients.  Once assembled, I baked the cups for 30 minutes which didn't overbake the crumble topping (the topping saved the dish from being inedible!).  DH and I both like the flavor -- not too sweet!  I'm going to try it again with a shorter precook time; I'm giving it 5 stars as the flavor was wonderful, the topping was perfect and the consistency was my own fault.  Use the honey!

Awesome! Especially enjoyed warm in a mug with a splash of half and half. I added the juice of half a lemon and 2 Tbs cornstarch to the fruit based on the other comments. To my taste, no additional honey is needed since the topping is sweet. I really had to stop myself from eating the whole thing in a sitting!

Yum! I loved this! A nice way to use some of that rhubarb that magically appears in my yard every year. I did what other people suggested and added 2T corn starch and an extra T of honey. I also added some lemon zest because I love lemon zest in fruit desserts! I saw lot of complaints in earlier reviews about the fruit not getting cooked enough so I went ahead and covered the pan with foil and cooked it for 30 minutes and then uncovered it and cooked it for another 30. That seemed to be just right and the fruit was nice and soft. This started out very tart right out of the over but after sitting in the fridge for the night the tartness mellowed out a lot! Next time I might even try it with just 1T honey! Thanks for the great recipe that I don't have to feel as guilty about!

I added an extra half pint of strawberries, used 2 tablespoons of honey, and 2 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch (due to extra strawberries).  I also sprinkled a tablespoon of sugar over the fruit before adding topping.  I replaced 1/4 cup of oats with flour as well.  This came out nice and crunchy.  If you like the crunch and are not afraid of the sugar, I recommend doubling the topping.  This will also allow you to cook the dish an extra five or ten minutes to make sure the rhubarb is nice and soft.  Very yummy!

My neighbor gave me a bunch of rhubarb and I came across this great recipe to help me use it up... I loved that this recipe didn't have gobs of sugar and used honey as a sweetener instead. Perfect for a picnic served with vanilla ice cream. Was a big hit with our guests! Will make again. Thank you for this recipe!

Unbelievable flavor. I must say, I made changes, so to be fair I am rating my version, but the base recipe is great. I added 4 Tbsp flour to the fruit mixture, and used 2 Tbsp honey, 3 Splenda packets , and a Tbsp of real sugar.

Delicious!  I added a half cup of ground flax meal to the crisp topping for added health benefit ^^  I personally like the more liquid consistency so it's all about preference in terms of whether or not you add the cornstarch.

I agree that most rhubarb recipes add way too much sugar; I thought this recipe had the perfect amount.  (Although I used more strawberries and less rhubarb because I didn't have enough rhubarb at home.)  I brought it into work and got several compliments on it.

Great recipe for a healthier strawberry-rhubarb dessert - I could let myself indulge!  After reading reviews from some others about the dessert being too tart, I cut the rhubarb to 3 1/2c. and upped the berries to 2 1/2 c to bring out the sweetness of the strawberries a bit more. I also added 1 tsp lime juice and 2 tbsp cornstarch to the berry mix. I used 1/4 c. of applesauce instead of butter in the topping and used Spenda brown sugar in place of the regular brown.  My only beef is that there didn't seem to be quite enough topping to cover the whole dish (I used a round pie dish). Next time I'll make 1/2 times more topping and see if that does the trick.

Wonderful tangy taste. However the topping works better with a little flour added. I put in 1/2 cup and spices

Quite good. I did add 2 Tbsp cornstarch and 2 total Tbsp of honey, as one reviewer mentioned. Turned out great and definitely not too sweet. Other recipes called for 2 cups of sugar!

I don't know that mine was all that low-sugar but it was RIDICULOUSLY good!  I only had 2 cups of rhubarb and I feel like it would have been better with the whole four cups.  I used 2 Tablespoons of honey and 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch.  SO GOOD!!!

Solid.  Made it with the cornstarch as so many had suggested and a bit more honey as well.  Looks great, tastes great.  Huge hit.

Fantastic!!!  Just moved to a new house with a ton of rhubarb in the garden and was looking for something to make.  Loved how the flavor of the rhubarb wasn't masked by sugar.  Will definitely be keeping this for new year:)

This was the best! My husband and I ate practically the whole thing. Just with that it wasn't the end of the rhubarb season. Will try it with frozen and see how it turns out.

I made this last night and it was AMAZING! My family loves strawberry rhubarb pies and crisps but we are try hard to cut back on the sugar we eat. This was perfect! Even my brother, the only one that doesn't like strawberry rhubarb, thought it was "actually pretty good". I did add extra fruit, just because I only had a little left and threw it in and it didn't change things at all. We topped ours with homemade whipped cream. I will be making this again...very soon!

Made this tonight following some of the recommendations from others.  I added the corn starch which really helped thicken things up.  I also added more honey but to be honest, I wish I just stayed with what the recipe said.  I like the somewhat bitter taste of rhubarb.  This is very good though.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks!

This was yummy, and I neglected to use the tips of other reviewers about corn starch and lemon juice. My pan was not quite full...only had half the rhubarb requested, and I added another pint of berries...(mixed berries from frozen section at Costco). Very good with lightly sweetened yogurt topping it warm out of the oven.

This is awesome. My family loved it. My husband said it was kind of like eating sour patch kids because of the tartness. I used 2 Tbsp. of honey and cornstarch. Easy and yummy! Thanks

Super tasty! I took some advice from others and added a bit more honey and cornstarch. I only had 2 cups of rhubarb so I put some more strawberries in. Consistency was great. I also added some apple sauce (1/4cup) to the crunch topping so I could put more oats in. I love the crunch. I didn't add more sugar and it didn't need it. Tasty tasty!

This was very good.  I had to substitute blueberries because DH ate all the strawberries in the fridge before I got home from work. I also added a little bit more honey, just out of personal preference, and a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken.  We really enjoyed it!

My 6 & 7 yr old boys LOVED this and gobbled it up! Reading other reviews, I did add 2 T Cornstarch and 1/2 t lemon juice. Also, instead of brown sugar I used Organic Sucanat and a stick of butter because I didn't read it good enough. Of course, that probably made it even more delicious! A definate keeper though!

Great base--just had to make some changes due to ingredient issues.  Was just making a small dessert for 4 of us and had more berries than rhubarb so I ended up with 1 c. chopped rhubarb and about 3 c. sliced berries.  I used Agave Nectar instead of honey but still used the 1 T. suggested.  I did do 2 t. of cornstarch and 1 t. lemon juice per others suggestions.  For the topping, I just halved everything but I did use Sucanat mixed with the brown sugar (1/2 & 1/2).  In case some are looking for ways to incorporate more natural sugars into a dessert---this worked great.  My husband & I topped it with vanilla yogurt & loved it.  The kids loved it plain.  I think I would melt the butter next time.  Worth keeping!

This is definitely a little more tart than your standard rhubarb recipe, but I love the fact that it only has a 1/2 c. sugar in it.  I did increase to 2 T. honey and added 2 T. cornstarch per the suggestions here. I also tried it with some chopped pecans with the oat mixture. Yum!

I made this over the weekend for my husband and brother and we all loved it.  My husband prefers  sweet to tart, so I added an extra tablespoon of honey for him.  I also added toasted slivered almonds -- the extra crunch was really great.  Yummy.

A very good recipe for a low sugar alternative to regular strawberry rhubarb crunch. I added 2 tbsp of flour to the second batch to thicken the texture a bit.  The first batch came out runny.

Disappointing.  Soupy, not sweet enough, and certainly not picture worthy.  Adding sugar and a thickening agent (cornstarch or flour) would be simple and necessary improvements.

Yum!  Followed recipe pretty close.  Like others, added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to the mix and added 1 more tablespoon of honey.  Also added 1 tsp of lemon juice.  Lots less sugar than a regular type rhubarb crunch.  Easy recipe with ingredients typically on hand.  Will be making again and again!

Mmmmm this was delicious! I used 3 cups of rhubarb, 1/2 pint of strawberries, and as other reviewers suggested, an extra tbsp of honey as well as 2 tbsp of corn starch. For the topping I only used 1/2 cup of oats and added 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour. Overall, a great recipe!

This was Very good but I feel it DID need a bit more sweet and will add a wee bit of sugar next time and I added some finely ground pecans to the topping and did as one review suggested~~put on lower shelf to cook a bit longer. Husband and guests loved and with sugar it will be a 5 star....

Gave 4 stars because of the changes. I halved the fruit (2 cups rhubarb, 1/2 pint strawberries) and baked in a 9x9 dish. I followed other recommendations and added 1T cornstarch and 1t lemon juice to the fruit mixture. Delicious!

Great recipe and easily adjusted to your tastes.  I didn't have 4 cups of rhubarb or an entire pint of strawberries and the recipe still turned out wonderful.  Add lemon juice for an extra zing and corn starch to absorb some of the extra juice.  Love this lighter and easier alternative to pie!

Loved this recipe!  Especially loved the topping but I did make a few changes for health reasons.  I didn't use the honey (as once you heat honey it's no better for health) so in the recipe I subbed it with 2T. brown sugar (still sugar but a few more nutrients) and a teaspoon of pure stevia extract to sweeten and some cinnamon (1 t.) to help metabolize the sugar I did use and I, too, added cornstarch but I added 3 T. because I can my applesauce in full cup measures and I used 3/4 cup for the topping so I tossed in the last 1/4 with the rhubarb mix. The topping is where I really struck gold.  I made twice the recipe so I used 3 cups of rolled oats, 3/4 cup packed brown sugar, 2 t. pure stevia extract, 3/4 cup applesauce and 1 T. cinnamon. I used NO butter at all.  It was sticky but when dropped by small pieces onto the strawberry/rhubarb mixture and then sprayed with three coats of natural butter spray and baked, it made a sweet and delightful crumb topping with very low sugar and tons of health.  I was thrilled with this topping and will use it for apple and other fruit bakes as well.  Thank you so much for this idea!

Wonderful and whips up in no time at all. I wast very, very tart - just the way we like it.  Serve with Ice cream. I used 2 Tbsp. agave in place of the honey, added 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch, and used the Splenda brown sugar mix in the topping. Next time I wouldn't change a thing. I will make this often.

Wonderful! I used Splenda brown sugar for the topping, which calls for half the measured amount of regular brown sugar and there didn't seem to be enough crumb topping then, so if you use the Splenda brown sugar, I'd still use the measured amount the recipe calls for. Fruit was great! I loved the fact that it was sweetened with honey and not a bunch of sugar! Will definately make it again!

Being a rhubarb lover I enjoyed this recipe but my husband who's not a bit fan of the sour/tart flavor did not care for it too much.  

My changes: I used 3 Tbsp of splenda and 2 Tbsp of corn starch in with the fruit and then used the splenda brown sugar mixture for the brown sugar part of the recipe.

I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for and the fruit was soft and the top a nice, crunchy brown mixture.

I took what little leftovers there were after my family dug into it and mixed it in with some cooked oatmeal for breakfast and added some fresh blueberries and oddly enough the texture and taste was similar to the strawberry rhubarb pie my mom makes.

I may make this again and if I do I'll add more splenda to the fruit.

This recipe is fabulous!  I did add more honey (2 Tbs) and 2 Tbs of Corn Starch as recommended by others.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very nice recipe.  I use maple and brown sugar oatmeal for the topping and it is amazing!  I also cut down a bit on the rhubarb and ub the honey by 1/2 teaspoon.

Loved this recipe! What drew me to it was the 'low sugar' part. I made a few changes - I added 1/4 cup of splenda to sweeten it. Other reviews said that the recipe was a bit tart and I really wanted this first attempt at introducing Rhubarb to the family to succeed. That - and I put a granola/brown sugar topping instead of the rolled oats. Made for a fantastic topping. Thanks for this recipe! We can't wait to buy more rhubarb and make this again!

very good.  I didn't measure the honey just squeezed it in with the rhubarb and strawberries.  I did add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch as others mentioned, it turned out well.

Awesome recipe!! So yummy for having very little sugar. I did however make some changes. I used 2 tbsp honey and microwaved the rhubarb with the honey for 4 min and then mixed in the strawberries. I also added 2 tbsp cornstarch to fruit mixture. I doubled the topping portion of the recipe except for the brown sugar. I still only used 1/2 cup for the whole thing. Also instead of butter I used applesauce and only cooked for 30 instead of 40 min. Must try!!

I made this and thought it was very good. I added the 2 Tbl of cornstarch per other's posts. I used blue agave instead of the honey. Are the carbs in the nutrition section based on unsweetened strawberries or sweetened? The ingredient list doesn't specify but I would think if we are looking at a low sugar recipe that they would use unsweetened strawberries, however the carb count seems high to me and thought maybe it included sweetened strawberries. Can anyone clarify this? I will definetly make this again.

Very good!  I took some other reviewers suggestions and added an additional TBSP of sugar to the fruit as well as 2 TBSPs of cornstarch.  It turned out really well - I love how you can taste the great flavor of the rhubarb since it is not too sweet.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

I used rhubarb only (no strawberries - I just can't get behind strawberry-rhubarb, when rhubarb is so wonderful all by itself!).  Instead of butter, I took another reviewers suggestion and used oil (safflower, in my case).  For as "healthy" as this ended up being, it was MIGHTY tasty.  Will definitely add to my recipe box and make again.  : )

This was awesome.  I got some stalks of rhubarb in my organic produce basket this week.  I'd never made anything with rhubarb before and didn't want anything with too much sugar.  This was perfect.  I only had 3 cups of rhubarb, so I made up the difference with more strawberries.  Even so, this was about at the tartness limit for my family, so I will probably do it this way from now on.  This is a great, healthy dessert that I plan to make a lot.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this was really good.  I made the recipe as is with no changes.  It was a tiny bit tart, but that's to be expected with rhubarb.  Mix it with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt and it's perfect!

Very Good.  Changed it a bit as I always do, added 8 packets of sweetener along with the honey and 2 tbsp of cornstarch to the strawberries and rhubarb.  Also added some slivered almonds to the crust.

Great recipe.  Husband is diabetic so I used Splenda in place of the honey (too many carbs) and Splenda Brown Sugar in place of the brown sugar.  Did follow others' suggestion, and added 2 tbsps of cornstarch for thickening.  I was hoping for a thicker crunch top, so added a bit more Splenda brown sugar and a bit more oatmeal.  Should have added more oatmeal, so the topping wasn't quite so thin.  Next time I'll use an 8x8 inch pan instead of a 13x9.  Other than that, we all loved it!  Served it cooled, with sugar free Cool Whip.  Hubby, who isn't crazy about rhubarb, raved about it.  8 year old grandson, who loves rhubarb and strawberries, had TWO big helpings!  GRRRREAT recipe!  I'll definitely use it again!

As is, I don't think my family would have liked this at all. You see, I come from a family of MAJOR sweet tooths...1 tbs of honey in a rhubarb filling was just not going to cut it for them. I upped the amount to 3 tbs, and  i thought it was perfect. Because I only had frozen rhubarb and strawberries, my filling was really runny. I added about a tbs. of cornstarch, which helped some. The topping was delicious...I kept snitching it as I cut the butter in :P I was a little disappointed in this, though, because the topping sank into the filling as it baked. This made the filling less runny, but I was hoping the topping would get all crispy and stay on top. Oh, well. I served it with vanilla ice cream and it still tasted good, although certain family members didn't like it, because it wasn't sweet enough. I'm not sure I would make it again, but thanks for sharing!

This was good but I can definately see why most rhubarb recipes call for a lot of sugar.  Rhubarb has a distinct tart flavor but I enjoyed it.  Something different.

A definite keeper with a couple of modifications.  I substituted cooking splenda for the honey - 1-2 tablespoons. It came out tart, but not too tart. As others suggested, I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar.  The topping was a bit skimpy but that may have been because I used the one minute oats.  Next time I will may double the topping.

This is great! Made the minor modifications recommended with the cornstarch and an extra Tbsp of sugar. Used Earth Balance instead of butter so that it was dairy free. A REAL summer treat that the family loved.

The crunch was more like oatmeal on top, not very crunch like. I also added a little bit of sugar to the strawberry/rhubarb mix. I might make this again with a different crust.

A bit sour for me, so I also added a little extra agave. Another way to reduce the fat content, is to use 1/4 c. real maple syrup(or applesauce) instead of the butter in the crumb topping. It's very easy with a pastry blender.  This is the same topping I use for apple crunch, with 1 tsp. added cinnamon to each the apples and the topping.

I love rhubarb--I can even eat it raw all by itself--but this was just too sour for me.  I ended up having to sprinkle sugar over the top of each serving and add a generous dollap of cool whip to cut the tartness.  Which is really a shame b/c I love the idea of this recipe.  One of my friends said she liked it, but the other also thought it was too sour.

This is a great basic recipe.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and used 2 small tbsp of flour (I used whole wheat) to soak up any juice.  I also used frozen strawberries instead of fresh.  I look forward to making this for potlucks and family gatherings!

quickly became my favorite strawberry rhubarb recipe-love that it is low sugar and has no flour-did add the cornstarch but other than that love the recipe as written-not too sweet like many fruit recipes-thanks for sharing it!  Is also good made with other fruits such as peaches and blueberries.

We have a large rhubarb patch so I made this last night because it was so easy and quick. It was awesome but like other reviewers I found it was too runny. Next time I will toss 1-2 Tbs tapioca with the fruit along with 2 Tbs (or to taste) Splenda brown and will cut down on the sugar load (dietary reasons) even more by using Splenda brown in the topping. I will also add another 1/2 c. oatmeal and forget the honey as it added nothing to the flavor and little to the sweetness. With the changes it could make a relatively healthy breakfast alternative perhaps topped with a drizzle of half and half. YUMeee! Suz190

I doubled this recipe and added a cup of blackberries, one Tablespoon of tapioca for thickening, and a half cup of raw sugar. What a great dessert to serve to family at the end of Summer tomorrow!!!

I made this last night with farmer's market rhubarb.  I substituted jarred Trader Joe's peaches for the second fruit as my options were limited.  It was great and was eaten by 3 people completely that night.  I did add the cornstarch as recommended and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 canola oil.
Thanks for the great, healthy recipe.  A fabulous way to enjoy summer fruits.

This recipe wasn't bad, but the primary reason it tasted good it at all was because it's hard to go wrong with strawberries and rhubarb. I did increase the honey to 3 Tbsp per other reviews and it was still very tart (I still liked it, because I don't mind tart, but it was even more tart than I am used to!). I included a tablespoon of cornstarch but it was still very runny (we called it Rhubarb Soup) and the topping was very scant - doubling it would have been a good call, but I was low on oats.  As it was, it wasn't very crunchy, either, more soggy.  Probably won't be making this one again as I have many other strawberry-rhubarb recipes I much prefer.

Loved it!  I do agree with other reviewers that it does need some cornstarch or tapioca to make it less runny.  Although, I didn't add any cornstarch, so we drizzled the extra liquid over vanilla ice cream, which was delicious!

Add a bit more sweetener to the fruit.  I halved the recipe, but used 1T of honey.  I used equal parts strawberries and rhubarb.  Tim liked it.

I thought this was best cold with a little Cool Whip.  I added 2 tblsp cornstarch but it was still pretty liquid after cooking.  Instant oatmeal worked OK for the topping. If I make it again I will add a tsp. of Splenda and reduce the cooking time by 10 minutes.

This is great...be careful if transporting, rather runny.  I was looking for a low calorie rhubarb dish and this fit the bill.  Better than a similar recipe on the WW recipe site.

I made mine in a single Pie Crust with Crumble topping.  
I also added 2 TBS Corn starch and 1 tsp. Cinnamon to the fruit.  Served with vanilla ice cream.  I will make it again.

Just made and tasted this great recipe. It was easy and tastes great. It is easy to modify. I like more fiber and cinnamon. I used a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, probably closer to 1 1/2 t.  Fiber was increased using 1/2 c oatmeal, 1/4 c flax seed meal and 1/4 c hulled hemp seed. Our garden didn't have a full 2 cups of strawberries so chopped nectarine rounded out the additional amount needed. An 8" cast iron skillet was used for the dish. Temperature and time was perfect for this tender, gently sweet dessert. This is a keeper.

I made one minor change. I used 1 tablespoon white sugar in place  of the honey. It turned out well but a little more tart than I expected. Luckily I served it with vanilla ice cream so it was the right sweetness.

I added 2 tbsp cornstarch and 4 tsp stevia to the strawberry/rhubarb mixture. I doubled the topping, but substituted 1/4 cup stevia for 1/4 cup brown sugar. Reduced to 1/3 cup butter, instead of doubling it to 1/2 cup.

Really good recipe. Because I didn't have 4C of rhubarb, I added more strawberries and also some dried cherries that I partially rehydrated. I took the advice of others and added more corn starch and the consistency was perfect, not too runny or firm. Also, I added a bit of lemon juice (about 1T) to brighten the flavors and a tad of nutmeg.  I don't care for super sweet desserts and thought the tart to sweet ratio was perfect. I'm going to make it again, using other fruits since I used all my rhubarb!

I did a few changes, not because I wanted to but because I didn't have what I needed in the list of ingredients. So, instead of honey, I used pure maple syrup. Instead of strawberries, I used frozen raspberries.  From what the other reviewers said, it was runny, so I did use a tablespoon of arrowroot powder, and one of tapioca starch, but now wish I hadn't! Probably just one of those would have been fine.  It's a little too firm as a result. But it's definitely a low-sugar taste. The topping is yummy. I added some sliced almonds to the top. I'll definitely make again, but probably will make as written and not add anything to the filling.

Delicious!  I have a go-to recipe for apple crisp but didn't know the proportions for strawberry-rhubarb.  This was great - and I was so thrilled to have it gluten free!  Many of my family members are gluten sensitive and it is great to have another go-to recipe for them.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again, probably sometime soon.  Thanks for sharing!  (PS - yes the outcome right from the oven is quite juice-heavy.  Just add ice cream and no one will care.  Or serve cold the next day when it congeals, or add the cornstarch suggested by others.  Lots of options!)

We've made this several times.  I've put in several fruit combinations (whatever I have in the freezer).  Rhubarb, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, apples.  The crust is super yummy and I like the fruit with a tang, not overly sweet.

Really enjoyed this. Used a little over 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for thickening and Splenda brown sugar blend.

Very good.  Would make again but would eliminate the honey.  Topping did not get as crunchy as I thought even though I left it in oven longer but it still tasted great !

This needed more honey. I doubled the honey to two plus tablespoons and still found it was too tart, bearing in mind that I normally cut the sugar in recipes to half what is recommended.  I also added two tablespoons of cornstarch to the strawberry rhubarb mixture to thicken it as suggested by others which did the trick.  After tasting it, I served it with a squirt of whipped cream, which added back the extra sweetness that it needed.  Having said all this, though, I will make this again but with the above additions since it was really easy and my hubby seemed to like it.

Tried it exactly as written to the letter; was way too runny and soupy; next time will definitely add at least the 2 tblsp of corn starch to thicken and probably double the topping, but sweetness was just write and the taste was yummy....just too much liquid.
